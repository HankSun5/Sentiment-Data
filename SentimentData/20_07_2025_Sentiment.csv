The Ministry of Internal Affairs, together with the police forces, has begun work to establish an official system to sell this large cryptocurrency stock. The total value of the cryptocurrencies seized by police is unknown, but in 2018 alone, 61,000 Bitcoins belonging to a China-based pyramid scheme were seized. At the time, the assets were worth around £270 million, but with Bitcoin reaching $123,000 (about £92,000) last week, they are now worth more than £5.4 billion. The government plans to develop a “crypto custody and sales framework” to securely store and sell these digital assets. It's not yet clear how much of the proceeds from sales will be transferred to the treasury, but proceeds from crime are typically shared between the central government and law enforcement. When victims remain unidentified, the treasury is known to receive a larger share.

High inflation and interest rates are driving up borrowing costs, while weak economic growth is weighing on revenue. The Treasury is reportedly considering alternative revenue streams, including tax increases. In particular, the positive steps taken by the Donald Trump administration toward cryptocurrencies in the US and the passage of the first national cryptocurrency law, the “Genius Act,” have led to a significant increase in Bitcoin prices. These developments are expected to inspire similar strategies in the UK. In the US, the Trump administration aims to create a national reserve using the $3.4 billion in confiscated Bitcoin. In the UK, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage advocates for the UK to create a national Bitcoin reserve, but the Labour Party has rejected the proposal due to the cryptocurrency's high volatility. *This is not investment advice.

The team confirmed that trading will commence after a step-by-step rollout, with only select community tokens initially unlocked at launch. Team and advisor tokens will remain locked. Rollout to Begin With Community Token Unlocks World Liberty Financial stated that only a portion of the community-held WLFI tokens will be unlocked initially. These were bought during earlier sales at $0.015 and $0.05. The remaining tokens, including those held by the team and advisors, will stay locked. Unlocking any of these in the future will depend on community votes. According to a post on the project’s official X page, the token’s tradability has been approved. However, the full rollout will take between six and eight weeks. During this time, the team will finalise listings and secure more exchange partnerships. The team also made it clear that there are no hidden allocations. They said no insider, advisor, or team tokens will be released at launch. This, they added, is part of their focus on fairness and building trust with early supporters. Tokens held in the treasury will be partly unlocked to support liquidity. WLFI Team Drops Second Presale, Shifts to Rewards Plans for a second presale have been dropped. Instead, World Liberty Financial is working with centralised exchanges to roll out a reward system. This will enable new users to earn WLFI tokens by participating in supported activities on these platforms. The team explained that they are not in a rush. Their focus is on building something solid that aligns with their values. They also stated that the WLFI token represents a long-term project, shaped by planning and user input. In related news, World Liberty Financial, linked to U.S. President Donald Trump, has released an audit of its stablecoin reserves, confirming that its WLFI governance token has become transferable. In related news, the Trump family has reportedly cut back its stake in World Liberty Financial (WLFI) following rising criticism . This is particularly true for Democratic lawmakers regarding Donald Trump’s ties to the crypto project. Community to Decide What Comes Next It is also important to note that the WLFI token will be listed on both centralized and decentralized platforms once the rollout is complete. Future steps, such as more token unlocks or changes to access, will be decided through community votes. Last week, the project completed a vote confirming the token’s tradability . With that in place, the team says it is now focused on doing things the right way. Notably, the proposal, submitted by the WLFI team on July 9, closed on Wednesday with a near-unanimous 99.94% in favor. Additionally, a recent update revealed that Aqua 1, a Web3-native fund, has invested $100 million to support the WLFI token’s role in the DeFi space .

Responding to her post, XRP community members began connecting her presence in the city to the absence of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse at the GENIUS Act signing event held in the White House. This theory gained traction when Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was notably absent from the recent White House signing of the GENIUS Act , which establishes the first comprehensive federal framework for stablecoin regulation in the U.S. IMF at @Ripple Headquarters SF https://t.co/Iwf4uIAEeO — Nathaniel C. J. Rothschild (@NCJRothschild) July 19, 2025 Improving Clarity for Cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, attended the signing ceremony on July 18, where President Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law. This marked a major step forward in clarifying the legal environment for digital assets. Two other crypto-related bills, the Clarity for Digital Tokens Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act , also passed the House but remain pending in the Senate. The Clarity Act seeks to define when a digital asset is a security or commodity, while the Anti-CBDC Act would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a retail central bank digital currency. While Garlinghouse celebrated this development , he was absent from the event. With the IMF’s managing director in San Francisco, one community member jokingly suggested that Garlinghouse had more important business to attend to, suggesting a secret meeting with representatives from the IMF. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is Ripple Working With the IMF? While there is no official confirmation of a meeting between both parties, some see it as a plausible scenario given the IMF’s prior comments on XRP. In 2023, an IMF document discussed the potential of digital assets, including XRP, to improve cross-border payments and address inefficiencies in existing systems. Garlinghouse has also previously made a case for XRP to the IMF and the Swiss National Bank. The timing also coincides with growing regulatory clarity in the US. With the GENIUS Act now signed and other legislation progressing, Ripple’s positioning as a cross-border payments solution provider could benefit from high-level discussions with global financial institutions. For now, however, this remains informal speculation. Still, for XRP enthusiasts, the possibility of a Ripple and IMF alignment carries significance and may happen down the line as XRP’s global relevance increases.

The chipmaker announced this week it plans to restart H20 exports to China, pending U.S. license approvals. Sources told The Information that an April ban by U.S. authorities on H20 shipments compelled Nvidia to cancel orders and give up its reserved production slots at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC). At a Beijing event, CEO Jensen Huang explained that TSMC reallocated those assembly lines to different products, and re-establishing them could require up to nine months. Huang added that once granted, export licenses for Chinese orders would be processed swiftly, and that Nvidia is preparing to increase its chip deliveries. In a separate statement, China’s commerce ministry said the U.S. indicated it would approve exports of H20 chips to Chinese buyers. Huang confirmed that demand remains strong but emphasized that shipments still depend on final license clearances. The company is also designing a graphics card for the Chinese market called the RTX Pro GPU, which meets U.S. export regulations and targets automated manufacturing operations and robotics training. Huang sold $50 million in Nvidia stock this week On Friday, Huang sold 75,000 Nvidia shares valued at approximately $12.94 million as part of a March plan permitting sales of up to 6 million shares. Earlier in the week, he divested 225,000 shares for about $37 million under the same arrangement. A spike in AI demand and the GPUs that underpin large language models have driven Huang’s personal fortune upward and pushed Nvidia’s market capitalization beyond $4 trillion, ranking it as the most valuable firm globally. On his third trip to China this year, Huang held talks with Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, who pressed global firms such as Nvidia to supply dependable, top‑tier offerings to Chinese consumers. Wang reiterated that China remains committed to attracting foreign investment and plans to further expand market access. Huang also met with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and Vice Premier He Lifeng. At a Beijing press conference on Wednesday, he praised AI models from Deepseek, Alibaba, and Tencent as “world class” and said AI is “revolutionising” supply chains.

This projection isn’t just boosting BTC’s appeal—it’s igniting interest across the altcoin space, especially among presale tokens with strong utility and growth potential. One name that’s starting to stand out is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized finance project gaining attention as it approaches a major milestone: over 80% of its presale Phase 5 is now sold out, and a 20% price increase is just around the corner. Bitcoin’s Momentum Is Fueling Altcoin Opportunities With fresh capital flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs and global sentiment improving, Bitcoin’s push toward six figures is more than just speculation—it’s becoming a broader signal of renewed confidence in the cryptocurrency market. The narrative is shifting back to fundamentals, and that momentum is lifting not only BTC, but also altcoins that bring real value and clear use cases to the table. While many are watching Bitcoin for long-term gains, others are looking at what $1,000 invested today might become in tokens that haven’t hit the open market yet. That’s exactly why attention is turning toward Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is building a lending and borrowing protocol that operates without centralized control. Everything runs on smart contracts, which means users keep control of their assets while interacting with fully transparent and automated lending markets. The process is straightforward. Lenders deposit assets like ETH or stablecoins into Mutuum’s liquidity pools and receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens represent their share of the pool and automatically increase in value over time as interest accrues. When it’s time to withdraw, users can exchange their mtTokens back for the underlying asset along with the interest that’s accumulated. No need to wait for a match or counterparty. The smart contract handles everything in real time. Borrowers, on the other hand, can tap into liquidity by posting overcollateralized assets. This means that to borrow $1,000, a user would typically need to secure the loan with around $1,500 in digital assets as collateral. This structure ensures stability and keeps the protocol solvent, while still giving users access to capital without selling their holdings. And because borrowers can choose between stable or variable interest rates, the system works for both short-term flexibility and longer-term strategies. What makes Mutuum different is that these mechanics are not theoretical. The protocol is already under development, and its beta version is expected to go live alongside the token launch—a clear sign that this isn’t just a whitepaper project. A Stablecoin That Makes Sense In addition to its lending platform, Mutuum is also building an overcollateralized stablecoin that will be fully backed by assets supplied within the ecosystem. This stablecoin will maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar through on-chain mechanisms—not through external custodians or unverifiable reserves. To generate the stablecoin, users must deposit collateral exceeding the value of the tokens they mint. Once the borrowed amount is repaid, those stablecoins are permanently removed from circulation. This system prevents inflation while preserving full transparency. Unlike many existing stablecoins that rely on trust in third parties, Mutuum’s model is algorithmic, decentralized, and designed to maintain long-term reliability. It’s another layer of utility that gives the MUTM token real-world function within the protocol. Interest generated from stablecoin borrowing goes directly to the treasury, reinforcing the ecosystem’s value over time. Nearly Sold Out Before Phase 6 The presale has already passed some major milestones. Over $12.6 million has been raised, with more than 13,600 holders joining so far. With more than 80% of Phase 5 already completed, the $0.03 price point is approaching its final stretch. As the presale moves into Phase 6, the token price is set to rise to $0.035, marking a 20% increase for incoming participants. That price will continue to climb across the remaining phases until launch, where MUTM is expected to list at $0.06. Those entering now are looking at a potential 2x gain before the token even hits exchanges. Adding to the momentum is the completion of a full audit by CertiK, which gave Mutuum a score of 95, confirming the security and readiness of its smart contracts. To encourage continued transparency and safety, the team also launched a $50,000 bug bounty program and a $100,000 giveaway for early contributors—both of which have helped strengthen engagement from new and existing investors. Mutuum Finance is gaining attention at the right time. As Bitcoin pushes toward $150K and overall sentiment shifts back to growth, early-stage projects with clear fundamentals are in the spotlight. Mutuum checks all the right boxes: functional design, audited smart contracts, passive income potential, and additional utility through its upcoming stablecoin. The presale won’t stay open forever, and with a 20% price increase confirmed for Phase 6, those considering an entry point may not have much time left. As market momentum builds, the opportunity to secure a position at $0.03 might soon be gone. For investors asking what cryptocurrency to invest in now, especially with a long-term outlook, MUTM looks like more than just a promising altcoin—it’s shaping up to be one of the best crypto investments heading into 2026.

Some are proving their value through real traction, scale, and strategic vision. BlockDAG, Stellar, Hedera, and Cronos are four standout names pushing in unique directions while capturing attention for all the right reasons. With bold partnerships, inventive presale strategies, and steady demand from retail and institutions alike, these four are reshaping expectations. If you’re watching for the top performing crypto this year, what they’re achieving now deserves a closer look before the opportunity slips away. BlockDAG: Smashing Records With a 3025% ROI Potential BlockDAG’s presale is turning heads across the entire market, and for good reason. Built on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, it promises lightning-fast speeds, scalability, and unmatched energy efficiency. Its low-energy consensus model supports parallel transaction processing, making it ideal for massive usage from DeFi to real-world integrations. Already, BlockDAG has raised over $343 million, moved 24 billion coins, and signed up more than 200,000 holders. Even now, the BDAG price remains fixed at just $0.0016 until August 11 , which is far below its confirmed launch price of $0.05. That leaves room for a rare, market-defying 3025% return, even for those joining late. On top of that, BlockDAG is offering what few others dare: full access. For the next 8 days only, all BDAG purchased directly unlock instantly at launch through the NO VESTING PASS. For anyone eyeing the top-performing crypto, BlockDAG offers both massive upside and immediate usability, an irresistible combination in a market full of delays and empty promises. Stellar: Closing the Distance on Global Transfers Stellar is redefining cross-border payments, delivering low-cost, fast transactions on a decentralized network. Its high-profile partnerships with MoneyGram, Visa, and IBM have secured its place in the fintech world. With more than 3.5 billion transactions across 6 million accounts, it continues to deliver measurable utility year after year. The addition of Soroban smart contracts gives Stellar a solid DeFi angle, though its main strength remains adoption over speculation. Currently trading around $0.26, some analysts predict it could reach $2.60 by 2026. For anyone prioritizing strong infrastructure and proven institutional trust over hype cycles, Stellar still shines as a top performing crypto, particularly for bridging the gap between digital and fiat payment systems. Hedera: Built for Enterprise-Grade Speed and Scale Hedera leverages a hashgraph consensus mechanism to provide fast, efficient, and eco-friendly transactions, a combination that has attracted heavyweights like Google, IBM, and Boeing. Its enterprise-grade approach delivers thousands of transactions per second, built for reliability and scalability. HBAR currently trades near $0.16 with a $6.8 billion market cap. Analysts forecast potential growth toward $2.00 in the coming years, fueled by pilots in CBDCs and increased business adoption. While its DeFi presence is still modest, its solid tech appeals strongly to institutions. For those watching for a top performing crypto focused more on utility and partnerships than flashy price moves, Hedera remains a smart contender. Cronos: Building Steadily in DeFi and NFTs Cronos powers the Crypto.com ecosystem as a Layer 1 blockchain, carving a niche in DeFi and NFT activity. Its proof-of-stake architecture ensures low transaction costs and compatibility with Ethereum assets, boosting its flexibility and reach. Recent ETF-driven excitement pushed CRO’s price up to $0.09, with a $3.1 billion market cap. Analysts see potential for it to climb as high as $1.80 by 2026, depending on continued DeFi expansion and rising user engagement. Although it doesn’t dominate headlines, Cronos’s integration into a major exchange keeps it highly visible. Among the top performing crypto options tied to ecosystem-driven growth, Cronos stands out as a steady, long-term player quietly gaining ground. Final Take: Who’s Pulling Ahead? These projects each deliver something different. Stellar focuses on global payments with real institutional backing. Hedera provides enterprise-ready infrastructure with exceptional speed and scale. Cronos thrives within its ecosystem through consistent DeFi and NFT activity. But BlockDAG stands out, delivering a rare mix of technical ambition, unmatched accessibility, and measurable progress. While others are laying foundations, BlockDAG is already generating numbers that hint at much more than just potential. In the race for top performing crypto , BDAG is closing the gap between market excitement and tangible results faster than most imagined.

China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is considering a six-month embargo on the resale of newly registered vehicles, which many see as a big swing to stamp out the practice of “ zero-mileage used car ” sales. The potential crackdown, which was reported by Auto Review, a publication affiliated with the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), is Beijing’s first concrete response to the long-standing issue in its highly competitive car market. China is considering a six-month ban on car resale The zero-mileage phenomenon refers to vehicles that are technically classified as used, despite never having been driven or transferred to actual buyers. Automakers and dealers achieve this by registering cars and insuring them before final sale, allowing them to meet aggressive internal sales quotas and report stronger performance figures. The measure, if implemented, would prevent any vehicle from being resold within six months of registration, curbing the manipulation of insurance and licensing data to record inflated sales. The issue gained national attention in May after Great Wall Motor’s CEO, Wei Jianjun, publicly criticized the scheme. The Communist Party’s People’s Daily also ran an editorial last month condemning the sale of zero-mileage used cars. China’s cabinet recently pledged to increase its supervision of the domestic auto market. According to Auto Review, automakers, including BYD and Chery, are now considering penalizing dealers who engage in practices like pre-licensing unsold vehicles. The China Automobile Dealers Association has also proposed a code system for tracking used car exports, which could further limit abuse of the policy loophole. Zeekr and Neta face accusations of inflating sales with pre-insured cars New revelations from Reuters also exposed how two Chinese electric vehicle brands, Zeekr and Neta, booked tens of thousands of sales using the pre-insurance tactic. Neta, owned by Zhejiang Hozon New Energy Automobile, pre-insured over 64,000 vehicles between January 2023 and March 2024, which accounts for more than half of its reported sales during that period. In many cases, buyers were unaware that the insurance had already begun and only discovered the discrepancy when the insurance policies expired sooner than expected. The dealers are claiming they were pressured to move the inventory and explain away early-expiring traffic insurance as “complimentary.” The strategy reportedly began in late 2022 and continued well into 2024, even as the company’s finances deteriorated. Neta’s parent company entered bankruptcy proceedings last month, and first-quarter sales for 2025 plunged to just over 1,200 vehicles. Zeekr, a premium EV brand owned by Geely Auto, similarly recorded inflated year-end sales in 2024 with the help of its state-owned dealership partner, Xiamen C&D. Data showed that out of the 2,737 cars “sold” in Xiamen that month, only 271 were actually registered for license plates, which is a necessary step for delivery to real buyers. The buyers reported being lured into purchasing these cars with discounts and promotional offers. One Zeekr customer said a salesperson promised a 3,000 yuan discount and a 10,000 yuan charging coupon, but the car came with a pre-existing insurance policy registered under Xiamen C&D. Zeekr has denied the state media reports, while Neta and Xiamen C&D did not respond to inquiries.

However, the premier cryptocurrency has experienced a slight price retracement since reaching this milestone. Interestingly, this fall in Bitcoin market prices has collided with a widespread gain in the altcoin market, with specific large-cap tokens notching up remarkable gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Not Over Yet? Short-Term Holder MVRV Suggests Further Upside 7-Day SMA Bitcoin Whale Exchange Transfers Near 12,000 BTC – Glassnode In an X post of July 18, prominent blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shares a profound on-chain insight on the Bitcoin market, stating that the volume of whale transfers to exchanges is presently on the rise. Notably, this development comes as Bitcoin experiences a moderate price correction after reaching a new ATH earlier last week, as previously stated. Glassnode explains that the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of BTC transferred from whale wallets to exchanges is approaching 12,000 BTC, one of the highest weekly volumes recorded in 2025. Interestingly, this surge in transfer mirrors levels last seen in early November 2024, a period that preceded a popular crypto bull run. When large holders move their BTC to centralized exchanges, it typically suggests they are preparing to liquidate some or all of their positions, either to take profits or to rotate capital into other opportunities. However, the latter scenario seems likely, especially considering recent trends in the altcoin market. Amidst Bitcoin’s price correction, several altcoins have recorded significant price gains, prompting ideas that the altseason may have begun. For context, data from CoinMarketCap shows that the premier cryptocurrency experienced a mere 0.27% gain over the past week, while altcoins such as Ethereum, XRP, and Solana registered price surges of 19.98%, 25.98%, and 8.86%, respectively. Historically, this development mirrors a characteristic altseason, when other cryptocurrencies generally outperform Bitcoin, leading to a decline in Bitcoin’s market dominance. Altseasons are triggered when investors begin reallocating profits from BTC into higher-beta assets, seeking larger returns due to the lower market caps of these tokens. However, more data from CoinMarketCap shows the altseason index is at 36/100, indicating that while altcoins are beginning to gain momentum, the market has not yet fully transitioned into a confirmed altseason. An index value below 50 suggests that Bitcoin is still outperforming a majority of altcoins over 90 days. Investors should stay alert for a cross above 75 which would suggest a full-fledged altseason to be declared.

In July 2025, utility is becoming the defining factor in long-term portfolio growth. Developers, creators, and institutional backers are favoring assets backed by real infrastructure and usage. Among the tokens showing exceptional promise this cycle are Hedera, OpenFundNet (OFNT) , Kaspa, FloppyPepe, and Chainlink — each with unique strengths rooted in real-world use. Hedera (HBAR): Public Ledger for Enterprises Hedera continues to lead the way in enterprise blockchain adoption. Its unique hashgraph consensus mechanism provides lightning-fast and low-cost transactions, which is essential for high-throughput business applications. Institutions like Avery Dennison and DBS Bank are already building on the network, making HBAR one of the most commercially viable L1 solutions. If the broader altcoin market continues to rise, HBAR is well-positioned for a bullish July. Source: Coingecko – Hedera OpenFundNet (OFNT): Web3 Launchpad and DAO Infrastructure OpenFundNet is emerging as a game-changer in the Web3 creator economy. It enables users to launch token presales, DAOs, and staking platforms without writing a single line of code. This no-code infrastructure is making decentralized crowdfunding accessible to a broader creator base. By bundling a launchpad, DAO builder, and staking platform into one seamless ecosystem, OFNT is laying the groundwork for the next generation of crypto projects. Its all-in-one ecosystem lowers the barrier for builders and creators to access decentralized crowdfunding. With a zero-fee structure and milestone-based funding, OFNT ensures transparency and trust between funders and projects. This innovative model positions OFNT as a core launchpad for the next wave of crypto startups. Kaspa (KAS): Speed and Finality in One Kaspa’s GHOSTDAG protocol makes it one of the fastest Layer-1s on the market, offering instant finality and high throughput. It has become increasingly popular among miners and developers alike, especially those focused on building low-latency payment systems. Its strong open-source community and robust technical foundation make KAS a valuable addition to portfolios betting on next-gen infrastructure. With Bitcoin’s momentum continuing, Kaspa is likely to benefit from spillover bullish sentiment. Source: Coingecko – Kaspa FloppyPepe (FPPE): Creator Monetization Meets Meme Culture FloppyPepe takes meme culture to the next level by building creator monetization tools directly into its ecosystem. Through platforms like FloppyAI and Meme-o-matic, users can turn memes and content ideas into monetizable NFTs or viral assets. The FPPE token fuels these platforms, providing incentives and rewards for creative engagement. Its ongoing “double your tokens” presale promo is driving massive traction, positioning FPPE as a meme coin with serious functionality. Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Backbone of DeFi Chainlink remains the most trusted oracle network in the DeFi sector, connecting blockchains with off-chain data and real-world assets. With growing institutional collaborations like those with SWIFT and DTCC, LINK is expanding beyond retail DeFi use cases. Staking mechanisms and broader adoption of RWAs continue to strengthen Chainlink’s fundamentals. For investors focused on infrastructure and scalability, LINK continues to be a reliable long-term asset. Source: Coingecko – Chainlink Comparing Utility and Investor Incentives BTC Bull focuses on sentiment trading and caters to Bitcoin Maxis with limited direct utility. FloppyPepe offers AI meme tools and NFT creation, combining meme appeal with actual monetization features. OpenFundNet (OFNT) stands out with its zero-fee structure, allowing users to launch presales, DAOs, and staking platforms without coding. Qubetics integrates AI and blockchain for scalable infrastructure, focusing on real-world enterprise solutions. Real Utility Tokens Will Outlast the Hype Utility tokens are proving to be more than just short-term plays — they’re forming the backbone of the next crypto wave. While meme tokens like FloppyPepe inject energy into the space, it’s utility-rich assets like OpenFundNet that are powering the infrastructure behind the scenes. Whether through launching DAOs, staking platforms, or crowdfunding mechanisms, OFNT delivers real tools for real builders. For investors seeking long-term relevance and explosive upside, OFNT stands out as one of July’s most strategic allocations.

Not every top crypto pick is moving the same way. The PUMP token price is gaining energy after its first buyback, with signs of a breakout coming soon. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) is cooling off after hitting $700, facing resistance as many locked in gains. In the middle of all this, BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking a surprising path. It has removed vesting rules with a fresh twist called the NO VESTING PASS. This pass lets all buyers get their coins at launch. No waiting. With just 6 days left for this offer, BlockDAG has turned normal presale rules upside down along with its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. PUMP Token Nears Breakout After Buyback The PUMP token price recently climbed to $0.006144 after its first official buyback. This caught the market’s attention and pushed the price into a tight symmetrical triangle pattern. The trading volume jumped over 140%, and holders now number more than 40,000. Experts are watching closely as PUMP nears a key resistance zone at $0.0062. Although there’s strong momentum, a full breakout hasn’t happened yet. Support lies between $0.0052 and $0.0057, giving PUMP some breathing space if it slows down. With more people entering the market, the PUMP token price is on breakout alert, but it still needs to confirm the move before anything is certain. BNB Falls Below $700 After Rally The recent Binance Coin (BNB) price update shows nearly a 2% drop in 24 hours, pulling back to around $680 after touching $700. Many users took profits after Bitcoin crossed $120,000, causing a ripple effect that also cooled down BNB. Technical signs are mixed. Strong resistance remains between $690 and $695. Still, a short bounce from $675 brought in some fresh buying. Despite BNB marking its 8th year and burning $1B, short-term direction remains unclear. The Binance Coin price depends now on whether bulls can break above resistance, or if the drop will continue. BlockDAG Presale Surges Beyond $342M With NO VESTING PASS Boost BlockDAG’s presale is setting new records. It has already raised over $342 million and sold 24 billion BDAG coins. More than 200,000 people around the world are holding BDAG, and 2 million users are actively mining with the X1 app, driving fresh energy every day. What’s the price? Right now, it’s just $0.0016 until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. That’s a rare chance to grab BDAG before it lists at $0.05, offering a possible 3025% return. And here’s the game-changer: BlockDAG has launched the NO VESTING PASS. Unlike other presales that lock coins or delay access, this pass gives buyers full control. Anyone who buys BDAG within the next 6 days gets 100% of their coins on launch day. No waiting. No lock-ins. The NO VESTING PASS completely removes all unlocking phases and timelines. Buyers get everything right when BDAG goes live. This isn’t just about getting in early, it’s about having real control from day one. Instead of watching your gains roll out slowly, you can make use of the full 3025% potential right away. With demand for BDAG growing fast, this feature brings a freedom most other projects don’t offer. BlockDAG is rewarding belief in the project, and it’s doing it without delay. Key Takeaway In this market, timing is everything. While PUMP is waiting to break out and BNB struggles with resistance, both are stuck in “wait and see” mode. But BlockDAG is already moving fast. It has raised $342 million, sold 24 billion coins, and introduced a major change with the NO VESTING PASS. This feature lets buyers unlock 100% of their BDAG coins the moment the coin launches. No waiting. No delays. And with a possible 3025% upside, it’s a big shift from how most crypto launches work. This 10-day NO VESTING PASS is only available for a limited time. Now, just 6 days are left. While others wait for breakout signs, BlockDAG is already delivering results. It’s not just another project, it’s the one already paying off.

These bullish projections come as XRP hits price levels not seen in the past seven years. The analysis also outlines how the cryptocurrency could perform through the end of July and what targets it might hit by year-end. XRP On Track To $5 By End Of July In one of his latest video analyses on X (formerly Twitter), Hilton shared his outlook on where XRP could be heading in the next few weeks. The analyst pointed out that the cryptocurrency’s price trajectory has already accelerated significantly since breaking above the $3.5 level earlier this week. Over the past 24 days, XRP has also posted an impressive 77% gain, further fueling bullish sentiment. Related Reading: XRP MVRV Ratio Flashes Signal That Last Led To 630% Surge Thanks to its strong price performance these past few days, Hilton notes that XRP is now less than 10% away from reclaiming its all-time high of $3.84, set almost eight years ago. He emphasized that the popular altcoin is currently exceeding expectations, with its price surging well ahead of schedule. With bullish momentum showing no signs of slowing down, the analyst predicts that XRP could reach $5 by the end of July. He attributes this potential upswing to strong liquidity flowing across the broader market, combined with rising demand and sustained bullish sentiment as the market enters a new phase of its cycle. Backing his forecast, Hilton mentioned the recent surge in XRP capital inflows. He noted that the cryptocurrency’s market value has surged from around $140 – $150 billion to over $207 billion in just one week. He further credited this influx of capital to growing institutional interest, compounded by Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), driving fresh entries into the market. Year-End Forecast Sees XRP Gunning For $20 Looking further out, Hilton has revised his end-of-year projection, citing the ongoing strength of XRP’s rally and improving market fundamentals. Initially, when XRP was trading within the $2 range, the analyst had projected a conservative year-end target between $5 and $10, even describing the lower end of that range as extremely modest. However, with the altcoin‘s price now solidly sitting above $3, he sees the potential for a more aggressive push in the months ahead. His updated outlook includes a baseline target of $10, which he now views as the low end of his bullish possibilities. On the higher end, he sees $15 as a realistic stretch target, and a run to $20 as a possible explosive climax before the year ends. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Just Hit A Fresh ATH Above $10 Billion, Will Price Follow Next? Several factors have been suggested as potential catalysts for this optimistic prediction, including XRP’s rising market capitalization, anticipation of a potential XRP ETF, and the long-awaited resolution and settlement of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit. Hilton has suggested all these factors are aligning to place XRP in a prime position for an explosive rally this year.

BONK is edging closer to the $0.00004 mark, but rapid climbs like this often run into pushback. Polkadot also shows promise with a clean technical setup, though its price history tends to defy the textbook playbook. Then there is BlockDAG, which is not waiting for signals. It is taking action now. With the NO VESTING PASS active for only six days, every BDAG coin purchased during this period comes with full access at launch. While BONK and DOT chase momentum, BlockDAG is handing out real utility and early liquidity. The race has already begun. BONK Approaches $0.00004: Questions About Pace Remain BONK has climbed steadily from under $0.0000150 to around $0.0000279, with its current price target now zeroing in on $0.00004. The move is supported by growing volume and technical strength, including bullish MACD readings and improving sentiment that aligns with optimism on market cycle models. However, this recent acceleration raises concerns about whether BONK can maintain its current pace. The chart suggests strong momentum, but some traders are beginning to watch for signs of exhaustion. As BONK nears its next key level, the question becomes whether it can hold or face a short-term cooldown. Polkadot Faces Uncertainty Around Key Supply Levels The Polkadot price outlook is centered on how DOT will behave near a visible H2 supply zone. The token recently surged without executing a common liquidity sweep, leaving two equal lows beneath the current price. This setup could invite downside pressure if traders attempt to test those levels. Still, DOT has a history of skipping expected chart behaviors, which introduces uncertainty. While a pause or minor pullback is on the table, there is also room for a move higher if the market rejects the overhead supply. The current outlook remains a balance of structure and probability. BlockDAG’s NO VESTING PASS Creates Rare Window for Full Launch Access BlockDAG is giving buyers something rarely seen in a presale of this scale: full control and instant access. For the next six days, the NO VESTING PASS allows anyone purchasing BDAG coins to receive 100% of their allocation on launch day. No schedules, no delays, just full liquidity the moment the presale ends and trading begins. This feature is adding fuel to a presale that has already hit historic milestones. BlockDAG has raised over $342 million and sold 24 billion coins. The special $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH price remains active until August 11, offering a potential 3,025% return against the confirmed $0.05 listing price. The NO VESTING PASS amplifies that upside by making every coin instantly tradable at launch. With momentum building fast, buyers are jumping in to secure both price advantage and early liquidity. This level of flexibility is a major draw, especially as BlockDAG approaches its final presale phase. It adds confidence for those looking to act now rather than wait out traditional lockup periods. The community continues to expand with over 2 million X1 app miners and more than 200,000 BDAG holders. The NO VESTING PASS does more than unlock coins. It unlocks access to one of the most aggressive early-stage crypto opportunities of the year. Quick Recap While traders track the BONK price target and analyze the Polkadot price outlook, BlockDAG is skipping the speculation. Its presale is moving fast, backed by action rather than waiting games. With momentum surging, BlockDAG is changing the pace and giving buyers a clear advantage. The limited-time NO VESTING PASS means buyers receive full access to their BDAG at launch, with no lockups or holding periods. Combined with a potential 3,025% ROI at the current $0.0016 price, BlockDAG is positioning itself as one of the top crypto gainers with real liquidity from day one.

Could that next gem be now ? With Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) gaining momentum, and Shiba Inu and Baby Doge Coin making strategic moves, investors are watching closely. But while Shiba and Baby Doge have carved out their place, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale has stirred up a different kind of excitement, an opportunity still within reach. Now at the Icebound Estates stage, Arctic Pablo Coin’s 32nd presale phase is heating up, and it’s slipping away fast. While others chase the tailwinds of older meme tokens, a new frontrunner is inviting smart capital to act before the doors slam shut. This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Shiba Inu, and Baby Doge Coin. Weekly Token Burns? Arctic Pablo’s Deflation Engine Supercharges Long-Term Value Built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) introduces a rare feature that’s turning heads: an aggressive deflationary model. This isn’t just another hype-based meme coin; it’s designed with intelligent scarcity in mind. Every single week during its presale, unsold tokens are permanently removed from supply. Not later. Now. But what happens after the presale? Arctic Pablo Coin keeps burning. Any tokens left unallocated are automatically torched, fueling an ever-tightening supply, which may drive value skyward for holders. Isn’t that the dream? A shrinking supply often means rising demand, and that spells potential gains. Why is this important for long-term investors? Because scarcity = value. The fewer coins in circulation, the higher the likelihood of price appreciation, especially when demand is set to explode at launch. And every single burn is recorded transparently on the BSC chain. Could this be the blueprint for meme coin sustainability? With this deflationary setup, Arctic Pablo shines among the Top Meme Coins to Join for Long Term . Final Stretch: Arctic Pablo Coin’s $0.0005 Window May Never Return Time to talk numbers. Arctic Pablo Coin has officially reached its 32nd meme coin presale stage, Icebound Estates, and the numbers are jaw-dropping. At just $0.0005 per APC, early supporters are sitting on potential returns of 3,233.33 % if they had joined in earlier stages, and over 1,500% for those buying in today . Now picture this: A $1,000 investment today gets you 2,000,000 APC tokens. When APC lists at its target price of $0.008, that same investment turns into $16,000. And if projections hit $0.1, you’re looking at $200,000 — a staggering 19,900% ROI from the 32nd stage. Has any meme coin offered this kind of ROI in such a strategic, planned rollout? With over $3 million already raised, this isn’t just hype; it’s traction. Momentum is building like a glacier ready to avalanche. Once Icebound Estates closes, this price point will be a thing of the past. Can you really afford to miss the last best entry point? Arctic Pablo shines among the Top Meme Coins to Join for Long Term, and it’s not waiting around. Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 Evolution Fuels Fresh Momentum Shiba Inu continues to defy odds. Once dismissed as a joke, it’s now writing a new chapter through Shibarium, its Layer 2 blockchain. This upgrade improves scalability and reduces gas fees, positioning Shiba as more than just a meme; it’s becoming infrastructure. Developers are now building dApps within the Shiba ecosystem, driving real-world use cases and increasing investor confidence. While it’s not at its 2021 highs, the token’s resurgence and developer activity hint that Shiba Inu is far from done. For those still sitting on the fence, remember: lightning doesn’t strike the same place twice. Opportunity doesn’t knock forever; it slips away like sand through your fingers. Baby Doge’s Ecosystem Push Signals Big Moves Ahead Baby Dogecoin, known for its vibrant community, has taken serious steps to evolve beyond meme status. With updates to its DeFi ecosystem, including auto-burn mechanisms and liquidity enhancements, Baby Doge is experiencing a resurgence. It recently announced expansions into cross-chain bridges, enabling smoother transactions between BSC and Ethereum. These infrastructure enhancements show that Baby Doge isn’t just about cute branding; it’s planning to stay relevant in the long game. Could Baby Doge surprise everyone in the next bull run? Possibly. But as with any rocket, the best seats are already booked. Don’t let the train leave the station without you. It’s better to be early than regretfully late. Final Words: Three Contenders, One Clear Launchpad Shiba Inu is evolving. Baby Dogecoin is expanding. However, one project is currently inviting investors to the ground floor , and it’s making waves for the right reasons. With a transparent deflation model, massive ROI projections, and presale momentum that’s already topped $3 million, Arctic Pablo Coin offers an incredibly rare window of opportunity. For those who missed early Shiba or Baby Doge runs, this may be the second chance you’ve been hoping for. The clock is ticking on Icebound Estates, and so is the chance to turn small investments into legendary returns. Arctic Pablo shines among the Top Meme Coins to Join for Long Term,and right now, that shine has never been brighter. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs What makes Arctic Pablo Coin different from other meme coins? Arctic Pablo Coin introduces a weekly token burn mechanism, which drastically reduces the supply and boosts long-term value. How can investors buy Arctic Pablo Coin during the presale? Investors can join the presale directly on the project’s official site and secure tokens at just $0.0005 before the price rises. What’s the ROI potential of Arctic Pablo Coin from the 32nd stage? The current stage offers a potential return on investment (ROI) of up to 1,500%, with a projected peak ROI of $ 19,900. Is Arctic Pablo Coin built on a secure blockchain? Yes, all token burn events and transactions are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). How much has Arctic Pablo Coin raised in its presale so far? Over $3 million has already been raised, proving strong investor interest and market momentum. Article Summary Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is making headlines as it enters its 32nd phase, Icebound Estates, offering a unique deflationary model through weekly token burns. At just $0.0005 per token and an ROI potential of up to 19,900%, it’s attracting major investor interest. With $3 million already raised, Arctic Pablo shines among the Top Meme Coins to Join for Long Term. Shiba Inu and Baby Doge Coin continue to evolve, but Arctic Pablo’s transparent scarcity mechanics and presale momentum make it a rare find. Don’t wait; before this price melts away, get in on one of 2025’s most promising meme coins. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release for informational purposes only.

48564930,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=769484,1752971219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48564930.jpeg,Bitcoin on edge as UK considers selling seized $7.1B BTC stash,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/uk-eyes-7-1b-bitcoin-sale/,"The UK government could be about to embark on a huge Bitcoin stash sale, worth more than £5.4 billion ($7.1 billion). The stash consists of Bitcoin seized in 2018 as part of a police operation to take down a Chinese Ponzi scheme using Britain to hoard crypto assets among others.. The 61,000 Bitcoin seized at the time were worth a fraction of what they are now. However, with the value of Bitcoin skyrocketing, trading for more than $123,000 (£92,000) last week, the haul is now one of the biggest crypto seizures worldwide. Such a sell-off would occur at a crucial time for the UK economy. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is facing growing calls to fill a £20 billion fiscal hole. The country is struggling with stagnant growth, climbing borrowing costs, and stubborn inflation that is already raising concerns about keeping interest rates up longer. To make up the shortfall, ministers have signalled that they may have to increase taxes, a politically perilous gambit. At this moment, the windfall from seized Bitcoin is seen as an unorthodox but attractive solvent. The Home Office is developing proposals for a “cryptoasset holding and realization framework”, which would enable police to store and sell digital currencies such as Bitcoin securely. It would also allow for efficient handling, liquidation, and re-distribution of assets seized during investigations. It’s unclear how much cryptocurrency the UK government currently holds. However, the volume of digital assets seized by police forces across the country last year alone highlights a significant shift—digital currencies are now rivaling, and in some cases surpassing, traditional cash in scale and value. Treasury move rattles Bitcoin market News of the potential sale has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community. Bitcoin, which has more than doubled in value since the start of the year, continues to climb, fueled not only by economic fundamentals but also by a growing sense of purpose and momentum in the market. The signing of the GENIUS Act in the US last week is a necessary milestone towards global crypto legitimacy. It opens the door to wider acceptance and reduces regulatory uncertainty for big players in the digital asset industry. Politicians, meanwhile, such as Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, have also been advocating for the UK to create a national pool of Bitcoin. Doing so, he says, would make the country financially independent and a global leader in the emerging digital economy. He has even floated this concept publicly — he called for a “crypto revolution” during a speech in Las Vegas in May. However, Labour has dismissed Farage’s plan, branding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as too unstable to keep such vital sovereign wealth in. Chancellor Reeves, in contrast, has concentrated on using Bitcoin proceeds to offset lost tax revenue, not to hedge against currency instability. The Treasury does not have a direct say on whether to dispose of confiscated crypto, but sources say the department is paying close attention to what happens. Any pushes here would greatly impact Bitcoin markets due to the size of the funds at play. Law enforcement drives crypto sale decisions While the potential windfall is a thrilling prospect for Treasury officials, law enforcement has the power to sell the Bitcoin. Seized digital assets are handled by bodies such as the National Crime Agency (NCA) and regional police forces. If the assets are unreturnable to crime victims, the proceeds are divided between the central government and law enforcement programs. In the 2018 confiscation, victims of the Chinese Ponzi scam demanded the return of their Bitcoins. Legal challenges could slow down or prevent any sale. However, if courts find that the victims cannot be traced or made whole, the state could be liquidated. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been central to contemporary financial crime, from scams and fraud to money laundering. As law enforcement has put more emphasis on tracking, freezing, and draining off these funds, focusing on what to do with these assets is becoming increasingly urgent in the new world of digitally induced crime.

CCC-rated bonds, the absolute bottom tier of speculative-grade credit, have returned 0.75% this month through Thursday, outperforming every other class, including investment-grade bonds, according to data from Bloomberg. At the same time, BB-rated bonds, which sit at the top of the junk heap, have delivered the worst performance of any speculative debt tier. That’s a major reversal from earlier in the year when fears over President Donald Trump’s trade policies made BBs the safer bet among junk names. But those concerns have faded fast. Stocks keep setting new highs, and investors clearly feel more comfortable stepping down the ladder to chase bigger yield. BB bonds lose ground as traders look elsewhere Robert Tipp, who serves as chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income, said it directly: “As investors have become more comfortable, they’ve begun to reach for risk.” That comfort is showing up in a big way as market players drop BBs and scoop up CCCs without flinching. But Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, isn’t buying the hype. This week, he said credit spreads are “a little unnaturally low.” That comment came just one month after he said that if he were managing a fund, he wouldn’t be buying any credit at all. Over at DoubleLine Capital, Jeff Gundlach, the CEO, said last month that his firm has “its lowest ever allocation” to high-yield bonds. The reason? He doesn’t believe the valuations reflect the actual risk. There’s also a change happening in the other direction. More cautious buyers are pulling out of junk entirely and sliding up the scale to buy BBB investment-grade bonds. The yield gap between BB and BBB bonds has narrowed to just 75 basis points, way below the ten-year average of 120. That means investors don’t need to hang around BB territory to get a decent spread. There’s also a technical risk hitting BBs from another angle, the so-called “fallen angels.” These are companies that used to have investment-grade ratings but got bumped down into junk status. Warner Bros. Discovery is one recent case. Its planned split into two separate businesses triggered a downgrade and dumped billions of fresh debt into the BB market. Kelly Burton, managing director at Barings, said, “When big names come our way we need to determine how well these names can be digested and whether it will cause a technical dislocation.” New moves from banks and stressed companies shake the credit scene While junk buyers chase yield, U.S. banks are making strategic funding decisions after earnings season. JPMorgan Chase chose to go directly to the domestic investment-grade bonds market. But Wells Fargo and Citigroup took a different route. They went after European investors first, holding off on their U.S. bond sale. In China, real estate giant China Vanke is now trying to extend its domestic bank loans by up to ten years. That move is supposed to reduce pressure on its cash position, which has been under strain for months. Meanwhile in the U.S., CEC Entertainment, the company behind Chuck E. Cheese, is in talks with its equity investors for $600 million. The goal is to handle upcoming debt obligations after its attempt to raise funds through the junk bonds market failed. In Canada, Alimentation Couche-Tard just walked away from a ¥6.77 trillion ($45.8 billion) takeover bid for Seven & i Holdings. After nearly a year of pursuit, the Japanese company that runs 7-Eleven stores apparently refused to engage in serious talks, forcing Couche-Tard to step back. Back in Texas, LifeScan Global Corp., which makes glucose monitors and is backed by Platinum Equity, filed for bankruptcy protection. The company reached an agreement to hand over control to creditors in exchange for debt relief. Lastly, fiber-network provider Zayo Group Holdings is close to finalizing a deal with its creditors to extend the due dates on part of its multibillion-dollar debt pile. The agreement is still tentative, but it could give Zayo some breathing room in a tightening credit environment. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Even as Donald Trump threatens to slap a 30% tariff on imports and crank up global trade tensions, the European Central Bank decided Thursday it wouldn’t react just yet. They’re locking rates at 2% and postponing any cut in borrowing costs. The move comes right before their seven-week summer break, with policymakers clearly choosing to wait and see if Trump’s threats actually turn into pain before they make a move. The logic is simple: don’t rush. A lot of officials are about to disappear on holiday. They’d rather keep repeating that inflation is on target, park any panic until the next batch of economic projections is available for the September 10–11 meeting, and deal with it then. That means no new action now, but no denial either that things are getting ugly. The euro’s getting stronger, which is hitting exporters and dragging down inflation forecasts. France’s messy budget problems are adding more heat at the worst time. ECB watches data, ignores panic Behind closed doors, the ECB knows the pressure is building. A rate cut in September is clearly back on the table, even if they keep hiding behind the usual “meeting-by-meeting” line. President Christine Lagarde didn’t flinch in her statement Thursday, repeating that “risks to growth are tilted to the downside,” as flagged by Morgan Stanley economists in their preview titled Ready for the Beach . The coming week will pour in the data the ECB needs to weigh that risk. On Tuesday, their own bank lending survey drops. Wednesday follows with a consumer confidence report, and Thursday will deliver purchasing manager indexes from all across the region, conveniently right before policymakers log off. Germany’s Ifo business confidence and Italy’s economic sentiment numbers wrap the week up on Friday. Outside the euro area, more inflation data will fly in from Japan, Brazil, and others, while Bank of England chief Andrew Bailey will testify to UK lawmakers about financial stability.His appearance comes just as the UK drops public finance data on Tuesday and faces PMI figures and retail sales later in the week. Global markets brace as central banks diverge Over in the US, the economic calendar is light.A Wednesday housing report is expected to show barely any change in the sale of existing homes. Numbers have been flatlined near a 4 million annualized rate, just slightly better than the 2010 post-crisis low. Thursday brings a report that might show a modest bounce in new home sales, after a brutal drop in June.But the truth is the US housing market is still locked in place.High mortgage rates and unaffordable prices are keeping buyers out. Meanwhile, Canada’s economic mood gets measured through business and consumer surveys this week. They’ll give insight into inflation fears and investment trends. Retail sales data for May and June could also confirm that shoppers are retreating, especially after tariffs spiked car purchases earlier in the year. In Asia, everyone’s scrambling to make sense of global trade chaos. South Korea opens the week with export data, followed by confidence and retail numbers. China will keep loan prime rates steady for the second straight month. Over in Africa, South Africa will show June inflation is likely up to 3.1% from 2.8%, thanks to meat prices. In Nigeria, the central bank will likely keep rates frozen at 27.5%, for the third straight time, with inflation still hot at 22.2%. In Latin America, Argentina releases its May GDP-proxy Monday. April saw a 1.9% monthly jump and 7.7% year-over-year, helped by President Javier Milei’s move to loosen currency controls tied to a $20 billion IMF deal. Analysts now expect Argentina’s second-quarter GDP to grow 8%, and third quarter by 4.2%, according to Bloomberg. Mexico is under pressure too. The Tuesday GDP-proxy print will follow April’s surprise strength, and inflation eased in June, finally, and the central bank has hinted it may now slow its easing plans. Brazil will close the week with its mid-month inflation report, likely down for a third straight time, driven by sky-high borrowing costs. But expectations for 2025 inflation are still above target.

While the White House was stirring chaos over the Federal Reserve chair, Scott stepped in behind the scenes, sat down with Trump, and made one thing clear: firing Powell would be a mess. And not the fun, ratings-friendly kind Trump likes, this one would backfire. Badly. According to the Journal, Scott privately urged Trump to stay put, arguing that a high-profile showdown with the Fed chair, just ten months before Powell’s term ends, would do more harm than good. He laid out three points. First, markets were stable, reacting well to Trump’s policies. Second, the Fed was already signaling two possible rate cuts this year. And third, firing Powell could trigger legal hell and a political fight that Trump doesn’t need during an election cycle. Scott warned Trump about legal risks and GOP pushback Trump had been toying with the idea of firing Powell for months. His frustration with the Fed was no secret. The president kept complaining that Powell was dragging his feet on interest rate cuts, which Trump believes are needed to reduce federal debt expenses. But last week, it nearly escalated. A senior White House official told reporters that Trump had privately said he might go ahead and remove Powell. Hours later, Trump walked that back publicly, telling press he wasn’t planning to do so. But by then, the fire had already hit the markets. Investors got spooked. Even the idea that a president might remove a Fed chair over a policy disagreement was enough to rattle confidence. And Scott knew it. So did Wall Street. If Powell had been fired, the Fed’s independence would’ve been in serious doubt. The central bank has to make unpopular calls sometimes, and if its leader is seen as replaceable over policy differences, the whole structure begins to crumble. But Scott didn’t just talk markets. He warned Trump that Powell wouldn’t go quietly. “If you fire him now, he’ll sue,” Bessent told the president, according to one person briefed on the conversation. The lawsuit could last months, meaning Trump would get no benefit from the decision. Just headlines and headaches. And to be honest, he’s already getting a ton of that on his own anyway. It doesn’t stop there. Firing Powell could leave the Fed leaderless. The Senate would need to confirm a new chair, but in August, most lawmakers aren’t even in D.C. And even if they were, several Republican senators already made clear they oppose any attempt to remove Powell early. Senator John Thune told Fox News flat-out: “I think the markets want an independent Federal Reserve.” That kind of pushback could block any replacement Trump nominates. And don’t forget who takes over if Powell leaves. The vice chair. Right now, that’s Philip Jefferson, a Biden pick and Powell ally. So Trump wouldn’t just lose a fight; he’d hand the keys to someone even less aligned with him. All of this is what Scott hammered home. Other Trump officials want Powell out over office renovation costs While Scott played defense, others in Trump’s camp are still looking for a way to push Powell out. Budget director Russell Vought is leading that charge. He’s focused on a $2.5 billion office renovation project that the Fed is overseeing. The construction is behind schedule and over budget, and Vought is using that as ammo to build a case for “for cause” removal, a legal loophole that could sidestep the normal rules protecting Powell’s position. As part of that effort, Trump recently placed three of his allies, including someone reporting to Vought, on a D.C. planning commission. That commission approved the Fed’s design plans back in 2021. Now they’re circling back, demanding site visits, and threatening audits. Vought, when pressed, hasn’t denied that this could be a setup to boot Powell. But he’s been careful with his words, possibly to avoid drawing early legal challenges. Some advisers believe this construction saga could serve as grounds for firing Powell “for cause,” even though recent Supreme Court rulings have made that move harder to pull off. Meanwhile, the Fed chair succession game has already started. Scott said last week that Trump is likely to get one or two picks early next year. It had seem, at some point, that the Treasury chief wanted the job for himself. But if WSJ’s report is to be believed, it was Scott who saved the global economy.

It’s coming from platforms gaining ground through real-world use, strong tech, and steady communities. BlockDAG’s early-stage rise is showing how a presale can go viral without shortcuts. Dogecoin, once seen only as a joke, still holds public interest through its cultural force. Fetch AI is giving real shape to AI and blockchain working together. Cardano continues to show that research-based progress can still lead the way. Each project is different, offering a fresh take on what defines top altcoins in 2025. 1. BlockDAG’s Presale Momentum and Tech Stack Draw Attention BlockDAG’s growing presale crowd is speeding up. From online groups to public chats, more participants are securing BDAG coins with each batch before prices go higher. That growth isn’t by chance. The project’s 25% referral reward system has turned regular users into active promoters. This has helped build a large network of over 200,000 holders and 2 million mining BDAG through the popular X1 app. Behind this viral spread is a system doing real work. BlockDAG (BDAG) uses a Directed Acyclic Graph structure, which lets many blocks process at the same time. That means fewer hold-ups and smooth performance, even as traffic increases. Presale results show how fast interest is rising: $342 million raised and 24 billion coins sold. Mining gear sales have also crossed $7.9 million. Buyers are securing the $0.0016 price before August 11, ahead of the $0.05 listing and its 3025% return potential. This mix of demand and structure puts BlockDAG among the top altcoins gaining notice in 2025. 2. Fetch AI’s Role in Making AI Technology Useful and Decentralized Fetch AI is picking up pace as artificial intelligence finds more space in real-world systems. Priced near $0.72, FET supports a decentralized system where independent agents perform complex tasks, including smart mobility and supply chain tasks. This is not just theoretical, Fetch’s tools are already being tested in real pilot programs across different sectors. With a $1.72B market cap, there’s clear early belief in its direction. Many see FET as part of the next wave of AI-focused blockchain growth. Unlike many AI-linked projects, Fetch AI has a working system and rising use. Its combination of machine learning and blockchain makes it one of the top altcoins for those who believe AI will play a major role in the future of digital services and systems. 3. Dogecoin Keeps Its Position with Strong Community Support Dogecoin continues to hold its place in the market, outperforming most meme-based coins and staying in the top rankings by market size. While it started as a joke, DOGE has developed its own space in crypto, driven by social media energy and repeated mentions from Elon Musk. With a current price around $0.19, its ups and downs have calmed since the 2021 surge, but people still speculate on its next move. There’s also renewed interest in the idea of a Dogecoin ETF, with some expecting it could get approval by 2026. If it does, it may bring in broader attention. Even if past highs are not reached again, Dogecoin’s strong presence and loyal base keep it among the top altcoins for those focused on meme-driven appeal and cultural value. 4. Cardano Builds Quietly with Layer-1 Growth and DeFi Activity Cardano has always taken a slow and research-focused path, and that method is starting to show results. The recent Hydra upgrade improves its speed, while more DeFi projects are launching on the network. ADA trades at $0.71 and has a market cap of over $20 billion, showing it remains a major player. Some experts have also raised the possibility of a Cardano ETF, which could increase market interest. Price forecasts are mixed, with some pointing to a range of $3 to $5 by the end of 2025. What sets Cardano apart is its steady pace and science-backed development, rather than hype. That makes it one of the top altcoins for long-term support of Layer-1 networks with real progress. Final Thoughts on the Top Altcoins That Could Shape 2025 From Dogecoin’s meme-driven backing to Fetch AI’s real-world AI tools and Cardano’s detailed development, each of these top altcoins offers something unique. They are among the top altcoins worth tracking as the crypto space evolves. Still, one project is moving faster and more efficiently: BlockDAG. Its presale growth, use of DAG architecture, and clear pricing setup give it a different kind of momentum. While others depend on past success or slow growth, BlockDAG is gaining ground through fast action and a design built to scale. That’s what puts it on the list of 2025’s most talked-about altcoins.

The prominent altcoin is now facing major resistance at the $0.25 price level, the result of which bears significant implications for the current positive momentum. Popular market analyst Ali Martinez has weighed in on this situation, highlighting a chart pattern that favours a massive price breakout in the DOGE market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Expect 60% Liftoff If This Channel Breaks: Analyst Double Bottom Formation Tips DOGE For 82% Rally In an X post on July 18, Ali Martinez presented a bullish technical analysis of the DOGE daily chart, hinting that the altcoin holds significant potential for a sustained rally in the short term. Martinez’s post shows that DOGE price movement over the six months has carved a textbook double bottom pattern, i.e., a technical setup that typically signals a positive trend reversal. The double bottom pattern is a classic bullish formation, featuring two roughly equal lows separated by a peak, i.e, the neckline in between. In the chart above, this pattern is noticed with DOGE forming lows near $0.13–$0.15 in April and June, separated by a rally toward $0.25 in May, representing the pattern’s neckline. Notably, the crypto market surge over the last month has pushed DOGE towards $0.24 again, thereby completing the W shape of the double bottom pattern. However, to validate the bullish potential of this chart pattern, market bulls must hold a decisive breakout above $0.25 resistance, which will typically be interpreted as a strong buy signal, projecting further gains ahead. This is a highly possible scenario as the steep recovery from the June lows shows increasing bullish momentum with buyers stepping in with higher volume, pushing price action upward in a nearly uninterrupted fashion. According to Ali Martinez, a successful clearance of the $0.25 neckline paves DOGE’s way for a rally to $0.42, hinting at a potential 82.3% gain on present market prices. On the other hand, another consecutive rejection around $0.25 price region would dent the current bullish momentum and possibly initiate a return to support levels around the $0.13–$0.15 region.

Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is up by 108.5% suggesting suggesting a surge in market participation and growing bullish momentum, as traders continuously position themselves for a prolonged uptrend. With a market cap of $34.95 billion, DOGE retains its position as the ninth-largest cryptocurrency and largest memecoin in the world.

Investors who previously sat on the sidelines are now watching for smart opportunities—not just in the large caps, but also in presale tokens building real utility before launch. Among the top names gaining traction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new DeFi project that’s still in its early phases but showing signs of major upside potential. With a low entry price and real on-chain infrastructure in development, the token is drawing attention from investors looking beyond the usual headlines. Ethereum (ETH) Breaks $3,600 as Institutional Demand Grows Ethereum’s price recently surged past $3,600, marking one of its strongest performances of the year. This move has been supported by nearly $900 million in inflows to ETH spot ETFs and increasing staking participation across major protocols. The spike has helped push overall market sentiment higher, giving confidence to altcoin investors and shifting the narrative from caution to opportunity. ETH’s rally is about more than price action—it’s a signal that decentralized finance is gaining renewed interest at scale. With more developers, funds, and institutions building on or allocating to Ethereum, the timing couldn’t be better for up-and-coming DeFi projects. And that’s exactly where Mutuum Finance comes in. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Nears 80% Completion Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently progressing through Phase 5 of its presale, with over 80% of the tokens for this stage already taken. The current rate sits at $0.03, but this will rise to $0.035 once Phase 6 begins—marking a 20% price jump for incoming buyers. Early participants are also eyeing the final launch price of $0.06, which represents a full 100% gain from the current tier. So far, the presale has raised more than $12.6 million, with over 13,600 holders securing their position ahead of the next phase. That kind of growth in a short time frame is adding urgency to the moment. With a strong narrative around DeFi utility, and Phase 6 expected to sell even faster, many are now treating MUTM as one of the best crypto investment opportunities available before the next market leg up. Adding to the momentum are initiatives like the project’s $100,000 giveaway and a $50,000 bug bounty program, both of which are helping build trust and bring in new participants before launch. How the Platform Actually Works Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized framework that enables users to lend and borrow digital assets through automated smart contracts. The model is built on a non-custodial framework, meaning users always retain control of their deposits and collateral. When users contribute assets to the protocol, they’re issued mtTokens—flexible ERC-20 tokens that reflect their portion of the liquidity pool. mtTokens gradually increase in redeemable value as interest builds up, allowing users to later exchange them for their deposited asset along with the earned yield. They can also be used within the platform to unlock additional features, such as future staking in the safety module, where participants receive MUTM rewards from the platform’s buy-and-distribute mechanism. To access a loan through Mutuum Finance, borrowers must deposit collateral that exceeds the value of the amount they wish to borrow. For instance, securing a $1,000 loan might require locking in $1,500 worth of ETH or stablecoins. This overcollateralized model ensures protocol stability and protects the lender’s capital. Importantly, the entire process is automated. Users don’t have to wait for a counterpart—transactions are handled directly through liquidity pools, with interest rates shifting automatically depending on pool activity. Stablecoin and Layer 2 Expansion Beyond its core functions, Mutuum Finance is also developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed by crypto assets deposited directly into the protocol. Interest collected from stablecoin borrowing is routed into the project’s treasury, which helps reinforce the broader ecosystem. In parallel, the team is preparing to launch its own Layer 2 infrastructure, aimed at making transactions faster and cheaper. This upgrade will help reduce Ethereum gas fees and streamline all on-chain interactions within Mutuum’s protocol—something that becomes increasingly important as user activity scales. Ethereum’s climb above $3,600 is sending a clear message: the market is warming up, and decentralized finance is back in focus. But while ETH continues to climb steadily, early-stage projects like Mutuum Finance offer investors a very different kind of opportunity—one where real utility meets early pricing. With its presale quickly approaching the next price hike, a working beta in development, an audited and secure foundation, and long-term value built into its token mechanics, MUTM is shaping up to be more than just another altcoin. For those asking what cryptocurrency to invest in now, especially with the next bull cycle gaining speed, this may be the window to act before launch momentum kicks in.

48568435,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=769502,1752975983,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48568435.jpeg,US lawmaker slams GENIUS Bill as CBDC trojan horse,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-lawmaker-slams-genius-bill/,"US Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has warned starkly against the newly introduced GENIUS Act, which she fears will push a forced agenda in the US for a state-backed Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). Greene says that despite being pitched as a stablecoin regulatory framework , the bill includes features and control features you would find in a CBDC. “This bill regulates stablecoins and provides for the backdoor Centralized Bank Digital Currency.” Greene wrote on X. The GENIUS Act sought legal clarity around issuing stablecoins and operating them in the US. Yet Greene and others fear that under the hood, it effectively enables sweeping financial surveillance and control like state-run digital currency. Industry voices alarm over privacy risks There has been fierce support in the broader cryptonetworks community for Greene’s criticism. Her concerns have not gone unheard, with several other leaders and industry experts voicing similar fears, citing that the proposed GENIUS Act threatens to impact the underlying ethos of decentralization in digital currency negatively. Economist and Bitcoin maximalist Saifedean Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard, said in a recent podcast that the US dollar is already, in many ways, a digital currency. He argued that whether in physical form or through an app, the dollar functions as a digital token of the state, monitored and tracked by the government. Jean Rausis, co-founder of Smardex, said governments understand that controlling stablecoins means controlling financial transactions. He added that with centralized systems, authorities can freeze assets, reverse payments, and track spending, making stablecoins nearly identical to CBDCs. This sentiment represents a shared skepticism in crypto about any regulatory framework that would put stablecoins under centralized control. Privacy and financial autonomy are the beginnings of a bridge too far. For many of these people, the concepts of privacy and financial autonomy are simply non-negotiable, and any bill that threatens to interfere with these principles is met with outright defiance. GENIUS Act spurs concerns over financial surveillance The GENIUS Act has undergone several revisions since its initial release, with the latest major revision being in March 2025. These developments have introduced more stringent AML obligations, “KYC” requirements, and sanctions compliance requirements. And though they have been justified as necessary shields against criminal abuse, critics say they amount to invasive financial surveillance. Stablecoin issuers would be required to collect and share customer information and track all transactions; they would sometimes need to suspend payments if regulators tell them to, without passing information on why the transactions are occurring. For many in crypto land, this is not one inch closer to authoritarian repression, but a horrifying mile. This is all fine and good until 10 years later, issuers are required to keep some of that money in regulated banks and go through draconian AML checks, and the government freezes or confiscates the funds like they would any other bank account. The problem isn’t limited to the United States. The CBDCs are actively being rolled out in other countries, such as China and the EU. US crypto proponents fear the GENIUS Act, in pretending to support innovation, could take America down that same road, only low-key. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

PEPE shows signs of a 75% breakout backed by momentum and an active community. Kaspa (KAS) is lining up a 10x surge, thanks to its speed and tech edge powered by BlockDAG design. But BlockDAG (BDAG) is making the biggest move right now. For 6 days only, it’s offering a NO VESTING PASS that gives 100% coin access at launch. No wait, no delays. This puts BDAG in a strong spot as a top pick for anyone eyeing the best crypto for 2025. Kaspa (KAS) Price Outlook Points to a 10x Climb Kaspa (KAS) stands out in the current cycle with its fast BlockDAG structure and solid security. Its potential is clear, especially if Bitcoin touches $200K. Experts project KAS could climb to $0.85–$1.00 in the best case, or stay between $0.25–$0.35 in more cautious outlooks. Either way, that’s more than 10x above today’s levels. With a deflationary model, scalability, and community support, Kaspa (KAS) price outlook shows strength. It’s shaping up to be one of the top altcoins ready to run in the next cycle. PEPE Price Forecast Aims for Breakout and 75% Upside The PEPE price forecast suggests it’s one of the most watched meme coins right now. Chart signals show a falling channel with breakout potential, and analysts expect gains of 75%, with a target near $0.000022. PEPE has seen a 26% jump this week and 13% over the last month. Whale action and fresh exchange listings are keeping the buzz alive. With talk of a move to $0.000035 by 2025, PEPE could take the lead in the meme coin race. Claim 100% of BDAG at Launch with No Lockup – Only 6 Days Left The NO VESTING PASS gives traders a rare chance to gain full access to their BlockDAG (BDAG) coins instantly. For just 6 days, every BDAG purchase comes fully unlocked at launch, skipping the usual wait time seen in most presales. No lock-up periods, no delays, just full control right from the start. With Bitcoin hitting new highs and BlockDAG heading toward its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, the timing couldn’t be better. Anyone who buys BDAG within this limited window can take advantage of early access and act without restrictions. This one-week offer removes the usual barriers, putting the buyer in charge from the very first moment. Keep in mind, this offer only applies to BDAG bought during this time. Any bonus rewards or promo-related coins will still follow the standard vesting process. But for direct BDAG purchases, the path to instant access is now wide open. This is a rare chance to get ahead before the GLOBAL LAUNCH release. The NO VESTING PASS makes it possible to skip the wait and move fast. For anyone aiming to ride BlockDAG’s momentum, there’s no better moment to step in. The Bottom Line While the PEPE price forecast and Kaspa (KAS) price outlook show exciting growth potential, BlockDAG takes a different route. With the NO VESTING PASS now live, buyers can unlock 100% of their BDAG coins at launch, giving them the power to react right away. This fast-access window, along with the upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH release, puts BlockDAG in a strong position among the best crypto for 2025 . With only 6 days to grab this edge, the chance to move early and take full control is slipping away fast.

The latest 13F filings show Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates has lowered its stake in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, a benchmark fund that tracks the performance of the S&P 500. That fund now makes up about 8.5% of Bridgewater’s overall portfolio as of the end of March. Simultaneously, the hedge fund has increased its exposure to SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), an exchange-traded fund that tracks the price of gold bullion, less its expenses. Bridgewater increased its GLD holdings by about 33%, allocating approximately $340 million in total exposure to the precious metal. The move comes as Dalio repeatedly warns the US dollar’s decline could eventually trigger stagflation – a dreaded economic outcome marked by high inflation, high unemployment and low economic growth. But Bridgewater’s portfolio is not merely defensive. Alongside GLD, the firm has dramatically boosted its position in the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (BABA). Bridgewater increased its Alibaba holdings by over 3,000%, attaining 5,660,258 shares worth approximately $680 million. That makes it one of the fund’s top holdings. Alibaba’s stock has risen approximately 42% year-to-date, driven by strong growth in its cloud computing segment.

He emphasized the need for stronger, more stable price action from the LTCBTC pair before expecting a solid move in Litecoin. For now, his focus remains on the intraday chart, where he’s watching closely for short-term opportunities to scalp quick trades. LTCBTC Spike Fizzles After Bitcoin Dominance Rebounds According to CRYPTOWZRD, Litecoin and its BTC pair (LTCBTC) both ended the day with bearish daily candle closes, signaling potential short-term weakness. Despite showing some upward momentum earlier in the day, the broader market conditions shifted, impacting Litecoin’s price action significantly. Related Reading: Litecoin Fate Tied To Bitcoin – Will $96 Resistance Crack? LTCBTC experienced a brief spike, primarily triggered by a drop in Bitcoin dominance. This short-lived move created a temporary window for bullish momentum in Litecoin. However, the gains were not sustained, and much of the spike was quickly retraced as Bitcoin dominance began to rebound. As Bitcoin regained strength, Litecoin’s price action closely mirrored the movements of BTC and LTCBTC. This correlation led Litecoin to test the $112 resistance level once more, but the rejection at that zone caused it to lose ground and slide back toward the $96 support region. CRYPTOWZRD noted that any significant upside for Litecoin will likely depend on LTCBTC turning bullish again, a move that typically coincides with a drop in Bitcoin dominance. Until that shift occurs, the path higher remains uncertain, and traders may need to remain cautious of potential downside pressure. For now, the expert’s focus is shifting to lower timeframes, where he aims to identify short-term formations for scalping opportunities. Volatility Expected To Increase Near Key Levels For Litecoin CRYPTOWZRD concluded his analysis by noting that the intraday chart for Litecoin showed a clear bearish structure throughout the day. Price action lacked strength, and any upward movement was quickly met with resistance. This points to ongoing uncertainty in the short term, with sellers still maintaining some control. Related Reading: Litecoin Surges Past Descending Resistance – Bulls Target $97.10 Level Looking ahead, he emphasized that a clean reversal and reclaim of the $102 resistance zone could shift momentum. If Litecoin manages to hold above that level, it may open the door for a push toward the $112 resistance area. As his final verdict, CRYPTOWZRD warned that if Bitcoin doesn’t provide a strong directional move soon, Litecoin could continue to trade sideways with choppy volatility over the weekend. In the meantime, patience is key — traders should wait for a more mature, high-probability setup before entering new positions.

Meanwhile, three alternative cryptocurrencies are edging close to their record highs, within a small margin of their peak prices. Additionally, there’s excitement about a budget-friendly token that might see a tenfold increase in value this week. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE , Dogwifhat , and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges TRON: Empowering Creators in a Decentralized Digital World TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform aiming to transform how digital content is shared and rewarded. Launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation, it started on Ethereum but moved to its own network in 2018. TRON gives content creators full ownership rights and more rewards for their work. By cutting out intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook, it lets consumers reward creators directly. This means artists get a fair share of the income from their content. TRON supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). It uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin, with a public ledger where everyone can see what’s happening. In today’s market, TRX may appeal to those interested in platforms that empower creators. Compared to Ethereum, TRON offers developers a way to build dApps without worrying about high fees. As trends shift toward decentralization, TRON’s focus on fair rewards and easy content sharing makes it stand out in the crypto world. XRP: The Digital Currency Redefining Global Transactions XRP is a cryptocurrency supported by the XRP Ledger. Designed as a fast, low-cost digital currency, it’s open, borderless, and resists censorship. Transactions are processed quickly without a central authority, making them irreversible and secure. You don’t need a bank account to use XRP. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, it was launched with 100 billion coins. They gave 80 billion to Ripple for development. Ripple, formerly OpenCoin Inc., uses XRP to boost network liquidity. They placed 55 billion XRP in escrow to control supply. The name XRP comes from “ripple credits,” reflecting its goal to make payments seamless across currencies. XRP’s technology could transform global payments. Its speed and low cost set it apart from cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, whose transactions can be slow and expensive. XRP transactions settle in seconds, making it ideal for remittances and cross-border payments. In the current market, XRP looks promising. Its clear use case and strong backing give it an edge. With rising interest in digital currencies, XRP could become a key player. Though market trends are unpredictable, many are watching to see if XRP can overcome challenges and achieve wider adoption. Conclusion While TRX, XRP, and other altcoins near their highs, XYZVerse emerges as the first all-sport memecoin, uniting fans across various sports in a unique crypto ecosystem.

Since late June, LINK has surged over 70%, marking its strongest rally in months and reigniting investor confidence. The price action signals that this could be more than just a relief bounce—it may be the start of a broader recovery trend. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Sales Surge To Highest Level Since April – Details Market participants are paying close attention, especially as fresh on-chain data from Santiment reveals a surge in whale accumulation. Addresses holding large amounts of LINK have been steadily increasing their positions, a trend often associated with confidence in further upside. This accumulation, paired with strengthening technicals, suggests that the market may have finally established a local bottom. Chainlink’s price breakout is also occurring within the broader context of an altcoin resurgence, as Ethereum reclaims critical levels and overall sentiment shifts toward risk-on behavior. For Chainlink holders and observers alike, the next few weeks will be crucial. Whale Accumulation, Regulatory Clarity Signal Bullish Path For Chainlink Chainlink appears to be gearing up for a potential breakout as strong fundamentals align with renewed bullish sentiment. According to top crypto analyst Ali Martinez, on-chain data shows that whales have accumulated over 8 million LINK tokens in the past month. This buying spree suggests that large holders are positioning themselves for a significant upside move, reinforcing the view that Chainlink may be entering the early stages of a bullish continuation. Since February, LINK has experienced a deep and often volatile consolidation phase. Despite moments of upward momentum, the token struggled to break above key resistance levels—until now. The latest rally, coupled with visible whale accumulation, indicates that the consolidation could be ending, opening the door for a new leg higher. If momentum holds, Chainlink could begin targeting higher supply zones last tested during the late 2024 rallies. Adding to the bullish outlook, recent developments on the regulatory front could provide long-term tailwinds. The passage of the GENIUS Act and Clarity Act in the US Congress has created a more favorable environment for blockchain projects with real-world utility.

The recent breakout comes as LINK extends a strong uptrend that began in late June, with price climbing nearly 70% from its local bottom. On the daily chart, LINK has decisively broken through key moving averages: the 50-day ($14.07), 100-day ($14.42), and 200-day ($16.21), signaling a strong shift in momentum. This breakout is significant, as the $16–$17 range had acted as a key resistance zone for several months. The latest candle shows a clean push above this range with little wick on the top, reflecting bullish conviction. Technically, the move suggests that bulls are in control and the path to higher levels—possibly towards $20–$22—may be open if volume and buying pressure continue. Related Reading: Coinbase Premium Signals Aggressive Ethereum Accumulation: Institutional Demand Accelerates LINK’s ability to reclaim and hold above the 200-day moving average after a prolonged period of sideways consolidation adds further strength to the bullish narrative. While short-term pullbacks may occur, the current structure points to a market that has absorbed prior selling pressure and is now trending with strength. Continuation above $18.50 could set the stage for a broader recovery in the altcoin market.

BlockDAG Launches With 100% Access While Avalanche Tracks Resistance and Fetch.ai Watches Fibonacci Zones,https://thecoinrise.com/skip-the-wait-blockdag-launches-with-100-access-while-avalanche-tracks-resistance-and-fetch-ai-watches-fibonacci-zones/,"Crypto momentum is picking up in key areas, but not every altcoin is following the same script. Fetch.ai’s chart suggests a strong recovery, now trading above its value area low and retaking its point of control. If this base continues to hold, a quick move to $1.03 looks possible, and $1.40 may follow. Avalanche (AVAX) is also signaling strength, pushing toward $25.80 with consistent on-chain activity. If volume stays steady, a breakout to $37 could be next. Divergence on the AVAX/BTC pair supports the case for a larger move. But one altcoin isn’t waiting on signals. BlockDAG (BDAG) is skipping lockups with a 6-day NO VESTING PASS, offering day-one access to coins. At a fixed rate of $0.0016 and a $0.05 launch, buyers are stepping into full access and potential high returns, without the usual wait. Fetch.ai Price Analysis Eyes $1.40 if Current Levels Hold Fetch.ai (FET) is holding firm above key technical zones after bouncing off the 0.618 Fibonacci level and reclaiming its point of control. Historically, this setup has marked a shift in trend. Right now, the price structure favors a move toward $1.03. Should momentum sustain, the next target is $1.40. This outlook remains intact as long as consolidation continues above the point of control. With price action staying above the value area low, the data suggests that buyers are shaping the narrative leading into a retest of $1.03. Avalanche Price Prediction Aims for $37 as Momentum Builds Avalanche (AVAX) is gaining attention as it closes in on the $25 mark, supported by rising transaction activity and solid volume. After recovering from a $16 low, AVAX has maintained support in the $20–$21 zone. A move past $25.80 could open the door for the next major breakout. Looking ahead, the broader projection sits at $37, with $51 possible if momentum strengthens. The AVAX/BTC chart shows a bullish divergence, often a sign of a shift in direction. With network activity ticking upward, AVAX is well-positioned if the current pace continues. BlockDAG’s 6-Day NO VESTING PASS Offers Launch-Day Control BlockDAG is rewriting the playbook with its limited-time NO VESTING PASS, now available for just 6 more days. This gives buyers full launch-day access to their BDAG coins, no delays, no partial releases. It’s a direct entry point that’s rarely offered in presales. This offer comes during a major growth moment: $342 million has been raised and 24 billion BDAG coins have already been secured. The fixed presale rate of $0.0016 offers a projected return of 3,025% when compared to the $0.05 launch value. Set as part of the BlockDAG GLOBAL LAUNCH release, this pricing is only valid until August 11. Analysts are projecting post-launch targets near $1, making the current window even more attractive. Most presales lock up capital, but BlockDAG lets buyers access liquidity instantly. This move flips the usual playbook. Instead of waiting months, BDAG participants become active from day one. With time ticking down to just 6 days, this strategy caters to those looking for agility now and long-term potential ahead. Final Takeaway Fetch.ai and Avalanche both show strong setups, each poised for growth if current levels hold. But both are still waiting on market confirmation. BlockDAG, meanwhile, has already made its move. With over $342 million raised, 24 billion coins distributed, and a 3,025% potential upside at $0.0016, it’s already sprinting ahead. Its NO VESTING PASS, now in its final 6 days, puts full control in the buyer’s hands on day one. In a field of coins watching for momentum, BDAG is already setting the pace. It’s one of the best altcoins to buy now, because while others are preparing, it’s already live and moving.

That’s 2025 for you. Meme coins are in their wildest form yet—flipping charts, crashing Twitter feeds, and turning DEX wallets into goldmines. From Bonk’s bark to Notcoin’s unexpected surge, there’s one stealthy contender stealing the show. It’s not another dog or frog. Nope. It’s a whiskered rogue that’s floating into wallets with claws sharpened for gains. While Bonk ($BONK), Notcoin ($NOT), and Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT) are all doing rounds on crypto Twitter. Trollercat presale has quietly racked up over $350,000 and crossed 1400 holders. It’s now in Stage 14—a high-flying moment themed after the infamous “Balloon Boy Hoax”—and if the trend continues, investors might be staring down a projected ROI of 1833.4% at launch. The window’s shrinking. Every tick up means a higher price tag. Ready to sniff out the top 10 meme coins to buy this month before the pack catches on? 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) Imagine a coin that turns cultural hoaxes into launchpads. Trollercat isn’t just a meme—it’s a chronicle of history’s funniest internet moments, baked into 26 narrative-rich presale stages. Right now, it’s floating through Stage 14, themed after the viral 2009 Balloon Boy incident. Only this time, the balloon is real, the mischief is intentional, and the bag of snacks? It’s full of ROI. At $0.00009667 per token, this cat is already up 1833.4% from its $0.00000500 launch. Over 1,400 holders are onboard, and over $350,000 has been raised. The final launch price is locked at $0.0005309, and current buyers still have 449.19% upside. That’s without factoring in the 69% APY staking. Each stage adds to the legend—and the price. But what makes this feline fiend so magnetic is its built-in ecosystem: a deflationary Game Center, an audited and KYC-approved team, a two-year locked liquidity pool, and a 10% referral system that rewards both sides of the meme equation. Staking With 69% APY Let’s talk juicy numbers. The presale staking model on Troller Cat offers 69% APY—not a typo. Stakers earn rewards just for holding during the presale. There’s no vesting delay. You stake, you earn. And it doesn’t stop there. Ad revenue from Troller Cat’s Play-to-Earn Game Center gets funneled into monthly token buybacks and burns. Translation? The longer you hold, the rarer your $TCAT becomes. Picture this: you drop $50,000 at the Stage 14 price of $0.00009667. That nets you 517,131,399 tokens. If $TCAT hits its final listing price of $0.0005309, your bag could swell past $274,720—and that’s before staking rewards. All while earning passive APY in a coin that’s not just promising moonshots but baking deflation directly into its game mechanics. Why This Coin Made It to the List: It’s got a staking model even whales are purring over, a presale with built-in scarcity, and a roadmap that reads like meme history in motion. Trollercat isn’t just another gimmick. It’s storytelling + staking + scarcity = 100x energy. 2. Bonk ($BONK) Bonk’s bark keeps getting louder. Once dubbed the underdog of Solana, it’s now barking its way into every major meme coin convo. With strong NFT integrations and explosive community energy, Bonk has seen wallet numbers multiply like rabbit memes. Airdrops gave it momentum, but community memes keep the fire alive. Recent exchange listings and network activity have given Bonk a second wind, especially with Solana’s broader resurgence. Unlike other meme coins, Bonk built from the ground up with decentralized intention—no dev fund, no insider allocations. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Bonk blends meme energy with organic growth. It’s not just surviving—it’s thriving. And in the world of the top 10 meme coins, community strength is king. 3. Notcoin ($NOT) Don’t scroll past it—Notcoin’s “nothingness” is part of its genius. Born out of Telegram’s Tap-to-Earn experiment, it has now become a full-blown asset with a trading life of its own. Its ironic detachment makes it oddly sticky, and the meme economy seems to love the anti-hype aesthetic. In an age of overload, Notcoin’s minimalism is marketable. Plus, its association with the growing Telegram-based token layer gives it real infrastructural weight. Why This Coin Made It to the List: It’s the sleeper that blew up. Simple idea, executed with precision. Notcoin is pure alpha disguised as a joke. 4. Peanut the Squirrel ($PNUT) PNUT might sound like a kid’s snack, but this squirrel’s been stashing ROI in plain sight. Designed with deflationary tokenomics and clever gamification, it’s capitalized on the woodland-animal meme trend. The token’s playful art and staking bonuses make it sticky for retail buyers. It’s also one of the few coins where staking comes with random “nut drop” rewards—NFTs or small airdrops based on how long you’ve held. Fun? Sure. But also smart psychology. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Strong staking, growing fanbase, and that perfect mix of utility + cuteness. It’s more than nuts. 5. Book of Meme ($BOME) If meme culture had a sacred scroll, this is it. Book of Meme tries to create an actual blockchain archive of iconic memes—combining storage, memes, and decentralization. It’s weird. It’s smart. And somehow, it works. The community treats it like an art project. It’s traded like a serious token. A cultural relic in the making. Why This Coin Made It to the List: It’s one part internet museum, one part meme coin. Book of Meme is a crypto collector’s fever dream. 6. Snek ($SNEK) This ADA-native meme coin started as a slither and turned into a sprint. With a reptilian twist on the meme formula, Snek caught attention by becoming the first meme coin to trend on Cardano. Its launch was clean, and its roadmap is actually quite clear—merch, staking, and a mobile game are all in play. Low supply and early-stage buzz are driving up engagement metrics. Also, let’s be honest: people love weird animals. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Low cap, strong ecosystem entry point on ADA, and a quirky charm. It’s slithering into serious portfolios. 7. Floki ($FLOKI) Floki keeps evolving. After being dismissed as another dog-themed clone, the team went full utility mode. There’s now an education platform, real-world asset partnerships, and regular updates from the dev team. Combine that with its early Elon tweet fame, and you’ve got staying power. Floki may not 100x again from its current position, but 5–10x isn’t off the table if it reclaims market attention. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Real work behind the meme. It’s no longer just hype—it’s building. 8. Cheems ($CHEEMS) Ah, Cheems. The internet’s favorite stammering doge spin-off now has its own altcoin. With cartoon branding and social-first rollout, Cheems captured massive memetic attention. Its fan-driven chart pumps feel less like speculation and more like spontaneous combustion. And as Dogecoin and Shiba cool off, Cheems is picking up where they left off. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Meme perfection, pure culture energy, and a TikTok-worthy vibe. It’s got viral claws. 9. Brett ($BRETT) Born out of the Base chain craze, Brett’s origin story traces back to Matt Furie’s “Boy’s Club” and the same universe as Pepe. Its green-and-white art style feels oddly calming, and its community isn’t shy about calling it the next green giant. With a native base on Base (pun intended), Brett has become a meme coin with legs, not just vibes. Why This Coin Made It to the List: It’s got pedigree, platform alignment, and momentum. Brett isn’t here to play small. 10. Comedian ($BAN) Comedian is all punchlines and passive income. This meme coin rewards users for holding and voting on meme “jokes” submitted by the community. Think Reddit but tokenized. The best jokes get minted into NFTs, and the top voters earn $BAN. It’s like a roast battle where everyone walks away richer. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Interactive, hilarious, and actually pays you to laugh. BAN is a community-powered content machine. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the top 10 meme coins to buy in June 2025 include that mysterious cat climbing presale charts, Bonk, Notcoin, Book of Meme, and Peanut the Squirrel. While some of these coins ride hype alone, the top project brings together staking, GameFi, and meme lore for long-term potential. Staking plus monthly burns create sustainable upside, and its 26-stage rollout ensures no dull moment in its roadmap. Buy now before this cat claws its way out of reach.

At $0.00009667, you’d receive around 517 million tokens—before staking rewards and future growth. Is 69% APY in Trollercat staking real or time-limited? It’s active during presale only. Once the token lists, it transitions to a different model. Why do meme coins like Book of Meme and Peanut the Squirrel get investor attention? Unique themes, community hype, and gamification keep users engaged and holding longer. What makes the Trollercat Game Center different from other meme coins? Ad revenue funds token buybacks and monthly burns, reducing supply and boosting value. What happens after all 26 presale stages of Trollercat end? The project launches on UniSwap at $0.0005309 and enters its next roadmap phase, including CEX listings and staking unlocks.

This historic high is likely signaling growing user engagement and renewed optimism for the cryptocurrency sector. Deeper Dive Into The Stats According to data from analytics company Dune, the lion’s share of transaction volume is split between Solana and BNB Chain. The memecoin-popular Solana network is far ahead, holding 59.46% of the volume, followed by the Binance-initiated and now community-led blockchain, BNB Chain, which holds 18.76%. The Justin Sun-founded chain, Tron, is a notable mention in third place, with 4.68% of the transaction volume. Leading meme coin launchpads, LetsBonk and Pump.fun, are on Solana, likely contributing to the impressive numbers. The latter also recently completed an ICO. Despite being in second place in transaction volume, BNB Chain holds the lead as the ecosystem with the most decentralized applications (DApps), as noted in a recent BitGet report. Leaving sheer transaction volume aside, all three blockchains rank in the top 10 in terms of daily active users, as evidenced by data from TokenTerminal. Moreover, Tron recently outpaced Ethereum in global USDT transactions by over 5 times. This demonstrates regular participation from genuine user communities, which is crucial for assessing the credibility of a blockchain ecosystem . Big Developments for Blockchains and Assets The First Solana Staking ETF in the US went live earlier this month, exceeding the volumes of futures ETFs tracking the performance of SOL and XRP. A Spot Solana exchange-traded fund also appears to be fast-tracked for approval, as the SEC has requested S-1 filings by the end of July. These developments do not guarantee the launch of such a product, but are a step in the right direction. The BNB token, which is the essential power tool behind the BNB Chain, marked its 8th birthday a few days ago, noting significant growth since inception. Tron’s founder, in the meantime, has been involved in discussions with US policymakers, exploring the role of the network and blockchain technology in government.

While ETH rallies past $3,600 with momentum fueled by record ETF inflows and institutional adoption, a trio of emerging altcoins—MAGACOIN FINANCE, Polkadot (DOT), and Kaspa (KAS)—are rapidly positioning themselves as high-upside plays for the next wave of the crypto bull cycle. So, can these “hidden gems” ride Ethereum’s coattails—or even outperform it? Let’s break it down. Ethereum (ETH): ETF Inflows Signal a Push Toward $5,000 Ethereum is currently averaging $3,600, marking a 21% weekly gain and continuing to close in on the $5,000 mark. The rally is being led by massive institutional inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs, with BlackRock’s ETHA fund alone drawing $499 million in a single day. Other bullish signals include SharpLink Gaming, becoming the largest corporate ETH holder, acquiring $118 million in ETH. Additionally, BitMine, backed by Peter Thiel, now holds over $1 billion in ETH. ETHUSD Price Chart: Coinmarketcap ETH Exchange reserves are drying up, and on-chain sentiment is strongly bullish. Short squeezes on derivatives platforms have created further upward pressure With Ethereum’s staking ETF proposals under review and on-chain fundamentals improving, analysts suggest ETH could break its previous all-time high of $4,800 and test the $5,000–$5,200 range if current trends hold. Polkadot (DOT): Under-the-Radar Blue Chip With Big Upgrades Polkadot (DOT) is quietly staging a comeback in 2025, with a 15% weekly gain and trading at $4.4 after breaking key resistance levels. Behind the price action are several transformative developments and it includes: “Proof of Personality” (PoP) security model proposed by founder Gavin Wood, aiming to reduce validator costs by 80%. Additionally, the announcement of a DOT-backed stablecoin is expected to boost ecosystem liquidity. Despite Grayscale removing DOT from its fund and regulatory delays on ETF filings, Polkadot’s dev activity and technical roadmap suggest it’s far from finished. If the community embraces the proposed reforms, DOT could emerge as a top altcoin play once again. Kaspa (KAS): The Fastest Layer-1 Probably Overlooked Trading near $0.096, Kaspa (KAS) is gaining momentum due to its unique blockDAG architecture, which allows it to process 10 blocks per second—a feat unmatched by traditional chains. Recent highlights include a 14% weekly gain and a clean bounce off support near $0.072. Analysts are eyeing the $0.10–$0.12 breakout range in the short term, while long-term projections stretch to $0.25–$1 if bullish conditions persist. KAS is often cited as a high-risk, high-reward gem, ideal for those looking for exponential upside beyond the top 20 cryptos. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Viral Presale Moonshot Gaining Speed While Ethereum is leading the charge from the top, MAGACOIN FINANCE is lighting up the charts from the ground up. With a meme-fueled narrative and serious product development, this political-themed hybrid-altcoin has already raised several millions in investment. It has completed a full HashEx audit, with a CertiK audit underway. Now in its presale rounds, MAGA token is rapidly selling out each previous round as buyers rush to secure early positions before exchange listings and staking go live. With forecasts ranging from 20x to 75x gains post-launch—and some bullish analysts even suggesting a 5,000%+ ROI—MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as the breakout presale of 2025. Final Thoughts With Ethereum on the verge of smashing through the $5,000 barrier, the hunt for breakout altcoins is reaching a fever pitch—and all eyes are turning to MAGACOIN FINANCE, DOT, and KAS as the next wave’s top contenders. MAGACOIN FINANCE is igniting the charts with rapid investor adoption, turbocharged presale momentum, and explosive analyst forecasts. The next leg of the crypto bull run is underway—and while Ethereum may hit $5,000 sooner than later, early adopters looking for exponential gains should keep a close eye on MAGACOIN FINANCE, Polkadot, and Kaspa. All three have the tech, the narratives, and the momentum to become this cycle’s breakout performers.

With DOGE’s price moving past $0.25, bearish emotions are rapidly declining. Analysts now expect a probable 10x from here — and investors are paying heed. Even newer players like Remittix are picking up steam as a result of revitalizing the altcoin frenzy. DOGE Price Spike Ignites Fresh Bull Run Speculations The recent price surge in DOGE has once again ignited debate on its long-term appreciation. After a small drop to $0.2456, Dogecoin’s market cap is still very much over $36.89 billion, with the daily trading volume still sitting at $5.94 billion. A whole lot of attention for a meme currency that once traded for a fraction of a cent. Dogecoin has already survived a couple of crypto winters, and its loyal community — along with the support of Elon Musk — lends it a unique edge in the world of altcoins. But more than hype, DOGE’s rising use in retail payments, gaming, and tipping suggests it’s growing beyond its meme origins. Why Remittix Is Gaining Attention While the rise of Dogecoin is exciting, savvy money is also coming into up-and-coming DeFi tokens like Remittix, a scorching new altcoin that has already collected over $16 million in presale. As a cross-chain DeFi initiative, Remittix (RTX) facilitates direct delivery of crypto to bank accounts in 30+ countries. The Remittix wallet — releasing in Q3 — introduces actual utility to RTX with speedy, safe, and low-cost international transfers. Early adopters can now buy RTX tokens for $0.0811 with 50% bonus tokens before the $18M soft cap is met. Why Remittix Shines: Over 549 million tokens already presold Backed by CertiK-audited smart contracts Perfect for freelancers, remitters, and global earners Real-time FX conversion and fiat payouts Get in on the $250,000 Remittix giveaway today It’s not another token — it’s solving a genuine $19T payments problem, so it’s a best crypto presale 2025 candidate and a next big altcoin to look at. DOGE Momentum + RTX Utility = Big Opportunity DOGE’s breakout over $0.25 may be the catalyst for a larger altcoin boom. But experienced investors aren’t following the speculation — they’re seeing utility, presale momentum, and real-world adoption. That’s why both Remittix and Dogecoin are picking up momentum. One has the brand influence, the other has the technology to be heard. Together they represent the range of crypto’s next bull cycle — from meme money to cryptocurrency with actual use. Watch DOGE price closely, and don’t miss the Remittix presale. The next crypto high-growth opportunity may be right in front of you.

Trump Jr.’s $4M investment and new U.S. crypto laws add momentum to Thumzup’s expansion strategy. XRP hits $3.65 as Thumzup shares rise 267% since January, fueling investor interest in digital assets. Thumzup Expands Crypto Holdings Beyond Bitcoin Thumzup Media Corporation, a Nasdaq-listed firm, has approved a $250 million investment plan to expand its cryptocurrency holdings. The board of the company approved the strategy, and it will incorporate the digital assets, including XRP, USDC, ETH, SOL, DOGE, and LTC. The company previously held only Bitcoin, with 19 BTC valued at around $2.3 million. The new strategy will be based on creating a more diversified portfolio. Meanwhile, the strategy implies the transition of a single-asset exposure to a wider variety of tokens. The company will allocate depending on market conditions and internal risk rules. CEO Points to U.S. Policy Shifts and Market Access Chief Executive Robert Steele said the decision comes as the U.S. moves closer to regulatory clarity for digital assets. “As the U.S. federal government moves toward more crypto-friendly policies and greater regulatory clarity, Thumzup is committed to remaining at the forefront of this transformative technology,” he said . Steele also commented on the company’s long-term outlook. “By diversifying our portfolio of cryptocurrencies to gain wider exposure to the market as a whole, we believe Thumzup is optimally positioned to create value for TZUP shareholders,” he said. The timing follows the introduction of two recent crypto bills, the GENIUS Act and the CLARITY Act. Trump Jr. Investment and Trading Activity Drive Momentum The move follows an earlier announcement that Donald Trump Jr. acquired 350,000 shares in Thumzup Media, valued at around $4 million. He and his brother Eric are listed as advisors to Dominari Securities, which recently arranged a $6 million private placement in the company. Thumzup shares are now trading at $12.59, based on Google Finance data. The stock has gained 84% over the past month and is up 267% since January. The $250 million crypto strategy has drawn attention from both investors and analysts. Source: Google Finance Thumzup runs a platform that allows users to earn money by sharing sponsored posts on social media. Activity is tracked through its in-house dashboard. Payouts have typically been made through PayPal, but the company plans to offer crypto-based options. XRP recently reached a new all-time high of $3.65. At press time, it was trading at $3.42, marking a 26% increase over the past 7 days, based on CoinMarketCap data.

But while the spotlight shines on familiar names, another project is quietly gaining ground. MAGACOIN FINANCE, built around a community-governed and compliance-first framework, is drawing serious attention from early institutional voices. As interest expands beyond the usual top-tier assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE is beginning to position itself as a credible contender—earning comparisons to established players like TON and XMR. Solana Strengthens as ETF Excitement Builds Solana continues to show strong upward momentum, with recent price action reflecting steady gains and growing investor confidence across both daily and weekly timeframes. Technical indicators are bullish, with analysts pointing to pattern breakouts and resistance levels at $200 and above if momentum sustains. Solana’s DEX volume has set records—surpassing Ethereum and BNB in daily metrics—with more than $1 trillion in 2025 trades and daily flows over $3 billion. Network reliability remains high, supported by 15 months of continuous uptime and low fees, while the SEC’s fast-tracked spot ETF review adds renewed legitimacy. TON & XMR: Resilient Counterparts in the Spotlight TON (Toncoin) has been trading in a steady upward range, showing consistent strength and attracting attention with its multi-day price momentum and resilient performance. Its tight integration with Telegram fuels 42 million wallets and daily onboarding of 10,000 users. Monero (XMR), a leading privacy asset, continues to show resilience despite market volatility. Its network improvements and privacy upgrades continue attracting dedicated technical users, even amid regulatory uncertainties. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Compliance‑Ready Challenger MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly attracting attention for all the right reasons. Its transparent design and forward-looking strategy have started to resonate with institutional observers looking for early, compliance-ready opportunities. As the broader market shifts toward regulated infrastructure and long-term utility, MAGACOIN is emerging as a project with both momentum and staying power. With analysts and insiders watching closely, this early-stage window is being seen as one of the most strategically timed openings of the year. For compliance-focused investors seeking meaningful upside, the time to act is now—before this ground-floor moment passes. Recent projections from crypto analysts suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver outsized returns—as high as 19,500%, should its roadmap milestones, exchange listings, and ecosystem development continue to align with market demand. While these forecasts are speculative, they underscore the growing belief that MAGACOIN is no longer just a narrative coin—it’s becoming a structurally sound, ideologically resonant asset in an increasingly regulated environment. Final Thoughts Solana’s push toward a new all-time high reflects renewed confidence in infrastructure and ETF-backed momentum. Meanwhile, TON’s Telegram-centric growth and XMR’s privacy resilience each underscore diverse paths to long-term value. Yet as the landscape evolves, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving out a unique role—as a compliance-ready, community-focused asset gaining early institutional backing. For investors seeking textured, forward-looking exposure alongside established names, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a token not to miss out on before the next wave of listings commences.

DOGE Drops & Pump.fun Feels Whale Shakeout,https://thecoinrise.com/only-6-days-left-blockdags-no-vesting-pass-unlocks-full-coin-access-doge-drops-pump-fun-feels-whale-shakeout/,"With Q3 progressing fast, the focus has turned to top crypto coins like Dogecoin, Pump.fun, and BlockDAG. Each of them is making moves in the market, but only one appears to be gaining major traction at the moment. The Dogecoin (DOGE) technical setup suggests that strong support still holds, but concerns linger over near-term vulnerability if market-wide softness continues. On the other hand, a fresh Pump.fun (PUMP) token analysis highlights fading excitement as large holders offload their positions. There’s still a shot at recovery if new exchange listings restore volume. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is accelerating with over $343 million raised in presale. Its latest offer, a 10-Day NO VESTING PASS, gives buyers complete access to BDAG coins right at launch. With just 6 days remaining, interest is surging as people move quickly to secure this time-sensitive deal. Dogecoin (DOGE) Technical Setup Holds, But Faces Short-Term Risks Dogecoin (DOGE) fell 7.1% in the past 24 hours, reacting to the broader downturn after Bitcoin pulled back from its $122K high. Despite the dip, DOGE remains up more than 60% since July 2024, underlining its durability during recent corrections. The latest Dogecoin (DOGE) technical setup reflects both strength and caution, as support levels are still in play but fragile. Some traders may see this as a buy opportunity if the downturn stabilizes, but extended weakness could delay recovery. A key point is the absence of strong retail volume, as the latest surge was mostly driven by institutional activity. Until more retail participation returns, the Dogecoin (DOGE) technical setup might continue showing hesitation rather than sustained momentum. Pump.fun (PUMP) Token Analysis Reveals Slowing Momentum Due to Whale Activity This updated Pump.fun (PUMP) token analysis tracks its sharp rise and sudden cooldown. PUMP launched with huge volume, but within a short time, whales began offloading, causing a quick reversal. A single red candle took the price from $0.006 to $0.005, with $47M in trading on the first day. By the next day, volume fell drastically to $12M. Despite 37,000+ wallets now holding PUMP, the majority remains concentrated among whales. Market players like DWF Labs and Wintermute also received major allocations, raising concerns over price influence and centralization. Airdrop expectations remain unmet, and retail users are growing impatient. However, listings on top exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase could give PUMP another shot at growth. BlockDAG: Only 6 Days Left for 100% Access via NO VESTING PASS! BlockDAG’s presale has now crossed the $343 million mark, securing its position as the largest crypto fundraising event to date. Fueling this surge is a rare and powerful offer, the NO VESTING PASS, available for a limited 6-day period. In typical presales, coins are distributed in phases, with only a small portion accessible at launch and the rest unlocking gradually. This time, though, every BDAG buyer during this short window gets complete access to their coins from day one. Just to clarify, this only applies to direct BDAG purchases during the offer period; any bonus coins will still unlock according to the standard schedule. What truly elevates this deal is the price. BDAG currently sells at $0.0016 under Batch 29, a limited rate available until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. With a confirmed launch value of $0.05, this setup provides an immediate 3,025% upside for those who buy in now. The NO VESTING PASS isn’t just about early entry; it gives total control. Whether the plan is to trade or hold, users will be free to manage their BDAG however they choose on launch day. With 6 days remaining and Batch 29 nearly full, demand is growing fast. If there’s a chance to secure one of 2025’s top crypto coins, this could be it. Final Words! The Dogecoin (DOGE) technical setup confirms that it’s holding firm, but a sustained rebound needs broader market recovery. Meanwhile, the Pump.fun (PUMP) token analysis shows that although it was hit hard by early whale exits, it could regain traction through strategic exchange launches. BlockDAG, however, is pacing ahead. With its presale already topping $343 million and Batch 29 priced at $0.0016, this coin is generating buzz not just for potential ROI but also because of the 6-day NO VESTING PASS that offers full access. This direct control, along with a locked-in 3,025% return at launch, positions BlockDAG among the most talked-about top crypto coins for 2025 .

Crypto analyst VirtualBacon, in his latest video, shared a full breakdown of key developments that could impact XRP, Ripple’s IPO , its stablecoin plans, potential ETF approval, and ongoing market rumors. Here’s what’s going on. Will Ripple’s IPO Boost XRP? Ripple’s pre-IPO shares are currently trading OTC at around a $20 billion valuation, with some suggesting the stock could 10x post-IPO. But VirtualBacon warns not to expect XRP to follow suit. However, there’s no fixed connection between Ripple’s stock price and XRP’s token value. If Ripple goes public, big investors might prefer to buy the stock rather than the XRP token. Pre-IPO Ripple shares are selling at around $100, but only experienced investors can access them. So, while the IPO could bring more attention to Ripple, it may not directly pump XRP. Ripple’s Stablecoin and Bank License Plan Ripple recently applied for a national bank license in the U.S ., which would put it on the same level as Circle. This move supports Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD . Moreover, with new rules like the Genius Act on the way, stablecoin issuers may soon be required to hold real dollars or U.S. Treasuries. Ripple’s strategy lines up with these rules, and getting a bank license would make RLUSD more appealing to institutions. XRP ETF: Approval Could Be Close After launching XRP futures ETFs on the CME and NYSE, the momentum is building for spot products. VirtualBacon highlighted that Bloomberg analysts have given a 95% chance for spot XRP, Litecoin, and Solana ETFs to be approved by October. If true, it would cement XRP’s standing among top-tier digital assets. Swift Partnership Rumor Is False There’s been talk online that Ripple and Swift are teaming up, but VirtualBacon says it’s just a rumor with no real source. While Swift is testing technology that XRP supports ( like ISO 20022 ), it’s also working with other blockchains like Stellar and Algorand. Even Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said the two are still competitors. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple’s XRP Breaks 2018 Record After Trump’s Historic Crypto Law , Escrow Releases Are Normal, Not Dumping Ripple unlocks 1 billion XRP monthly, re-locking 70–80% regularly. While some claim Ripple is “dumping,” on-chain data shows consistency. However, Ripple plans to stop releasing quarterly XRP reports, citing SEC pressure, a move that adds some uncertainty. Still, these activities remain fully transparent on-chain. What Next? Meanwhile, XRP’s futures market is heating up, with Open Interest (OI) soaring past $10 billion, marking a new all-time high. This surge comes as XRP inches closer to $3.48, a level not seen in years. Historically, such spikes in OI have often signaled strong price rallies, hinting at potential further upside in XRP’s momentum. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

But it’s not alone. Several altcoins, especially MAGACOIN FINANCE, Pi Network (PI), and Kaspa (KAS), are also showing signs of strength or potential recovery, prompting investors to ask: Which tokens will lead the next breakout heading into 2026? From ADA’s institutional-driven rally to MAGACOIN’s ideological community surge, the market is ripe with movement. Here’s a breakdown of each project’s current status—and why institutional investors are showing interest in MAGACOIN FINANCE above others. Cardano Approaches Key Resistance on Path to $3 Cardano (ADA) is trading near $0.87 after a sharp breakout above a multi-month descending trendline. This rally from $0.55 has turned the price structure bullish on both short- and mid-term charts. ADA now hovers just below resistance at $0.90, with a potential move toward $0.95 and $1.08 if volume holds. On-chain data supports the rally. Coinglass reports a 31% jump in open interest to $1.66 billion within 24 hours, while daily trading volume has doubled to $5.77 billion. Technical indicators remain bullish, with the RSI nearing 69 and the MACD showing a positive crossover. If bulls maintain control above $0.85, analysts say ADA could realistically aim for $3 by 2026, especially with continued institutional momentum. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Coin With Real Utility and Vision Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is blazing its own trail as a politically inspired, fully decentralized meme coin. It’s winning over investors with smart tokenomics, no central wallets, and full ownership by the public. Beyond ideology, the infrastructure is solid. MAGACOIN has passed CertiK and HashEx audits, added cross-wallet support (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet), and developed a roadmap that includes CEX listings, staking, and governance. Telegram and X (Twitter) communities are growing rapidly, and analysts are projecting 30x–35x returns for early buyers. With the presale nearing its end, the window to join this movement is closing fast. Kaspa (KAS) Eyes Breakout After Rebound From Key Support Kaspa (KAS) is nearing a potential breakout after bouncing from $0.072 earlier this month. Price is once again testing the tough $0.096 resistance, where both the upper range and a descending trendline converge. A breakout here could send KAS toward $0.10 or even $0.12. Momentum favors the bulls. The RSI sits near 67, the MACD is trending upward, and the price remains above its 9-day SMA. The pattern of higher lows since early July suggests strong accumulation. If volume continues to rise, KAS could soon be one of 2026’s top-performing Layer 1 coins. Pi Network (PI) Clings to Critical Support, Bearish Outlook Looms Pi Network (PI) remains under intense selling pressure, having dropped over 85% from its all-time high. Currently trading around $0.45, PI is flirting with a breakdown of its $0.40 horizontal support. A clean break below this could trigger a steep fall toward $0.082, based on Fibonacci projections. However, the 6-hour chart reveals a descending channel, which can sometimes signal a reversal. If PI bounces from the $0.38–$0.40 range, a short-term recovery is possible, though indicators like the RSI and MACD remain bearish. For now, any bullish case remains weak and highly speculative unless strong buyer interest returns soon. Conclusion: Why MAGACOIN Could Be the 2026 Breakout Everyone Misses The crypto market thrives on narratives, and MAGACOIN FINANCE has one of the most compelling. It’s tapping into cultural momentum while delivering tech-backed decentralization. Analysts on X have already projected a potential 5,000% surge once it hits exchanges and the memecoin sector revives. With the presale nearly sold out and utility expanding across Web3 platforms, MAGACOIN offers a unique ground-floor opportunity. Early adopters enjoy exclusive staking multipliers, community governance rights, and future airdrop eligibility. If you missed out on PEPE, SHIB, or DOGE before they went parabolic, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be your second chance, but only if you act before the rocket takes off.

Several altcoins have performed significantly better since yesterday, with LTC jumping by 13% to over $115. BTC Calms at $118K The primary cryptocurrency started its impressive ascent in the previous business week when it finally broke above the $110,000 resistance and jumped to a new all-time high at the time of $112,000. The gains continued by the end of the week, and BTC neared $119,000 for another peak. The culmination, though, took place on Monday, July 14, when the bulls took the asset to its latest ATH of over $123,000. Thus, it had added more than $15,000 in the span of just five days. A correction seemed inevitable, and bitcoin slipped to under $116,000 in the next couple of days. Nevertheless, it defended that level and recovered some ground by the end of the week. It even challenged $120,000 and $121,000, but to no avail , and now sits around $118,000 after a calm Saturday. Its market capitalization has declined to $2.344 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts has been further reduced to 59.4%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView LTC on the Rise Most altcoins have also calmed over the past day. Ethereum has jumped by nearly 2% and now trades above $3,600. BNB and ADA are up by around 1%, while TRX and XRP have declined by similar percentages. SUI and LINK have jumped the most from the biggest altcoins, by up to 3%. Litecoin is the top performer from the largest 50 alts. It has added more than 13% over the past 24 hours and now trades above $115. ENA and XDC have also added double digits, while BGB and SKY have slipped by around 3%. The cumulative market cap of all crypto assets has remained at essentially the same spot as yesterday, at just under $3.950 trillion. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Is Something Big Brewing?,https://timestabloid.com/binance-receives-100-million-xrp-in-a-single-transaction-is-something-big-brewing/,"In the early hours of July 18, 2025, a notable XRP transaction caught the attention of the digital asset community. Captain Redbeard (@Brett_Crypto_X), a well-followed crypto analyst on X, posted a screenshot showing a massive 100 million XRP payment processed on the XRP Ledger (XRPL). The transfer was completed between two wallets linked to Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. The move has fueled speculation across the community about what might be unfolding behind the scenes. MASSIVE XRP MOVE! Binance just received 100,000,000 $XRP in a single transaction! Signs of surging liquidity demand? Is something BIG brewing behind the scenes? Stay sharp. This isn't normal. pic.twitter.com/1c9YCHIVBL — Captain Redbeard (@Brett_Crypto_X) July 18, 2025 XRP Whale Movements Hint at Market Anticipation Redbeard emphasized the unusual scale of this operation, describing it as massive and hinting that it may be tied to “surging liquidity demand.” Such high-volume movements typically point to institutional strategies or pre-positioning ahead of significant market shifts . The fact that the sender and recipient addresses are both affiliated with Binance has led to two dominant interpretations. The first is that the platform is bolstering its liquidity in anticipation of a rise in user demand. The second, more strategic, view is that a whale is preparing to sell a large number of XRP at a profit, possibly expecting a sharp price movement in the near term. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP’s 2025 Performance Supports Speculation The sheer volume implies significant confidence in XRP’s immediate market potential. Analysts often regard such activity as a sign that large holders are aligning their positions ahead of key developments. If the wallet’s owner anticipates a rally, shifting tokens to an exchange would give them the option to capitalize quickly. This transaction also lands at a time when XRP’s broader performance in 2025 supports the idea of renewed momentum. After struggling in previous years, XRP has recently shown signs of sustained upward movement. XRP is currently trading around $3.45, just below its 2025 peak of $3.65. XRP has shown strong momentum over the past week, and analysts are convinced that a new all-time high is on the horizon. A Signal Worth Watching 2025 has seen remarkable whale activity in the XRP ecosystem, and the timing and scale of the transfer support the belief that market movers are anticipating a pivotal shift. Whether Binance is addressing internal liquidity issues or whales are preparing for a significant move, it is clear that key participants are taking considerable urgency in their preparations, and both signs point toward a bullish future for XRP.

After surging over 70% since late June, ETH appears to have entered a new bullish phase driven by rising demand and institutional interest. The momentum has shifted clearly in favor of the bulls, with technical structure and price action aligning to support further upside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Miner Sales Surge To Highest Level Since April – Details Adding to the bullish outlook, CryptoQuant data shows that Ethereum open interest has reached an all-time high, pointing to growing trader activity and rising capital in ETH derivatives markets. This surge in open interest often precedes large price movements, suggesting that Ethereum could see heightened volatility and expansion in the coming days. The combination of sustained price levels, strong trend continuation, and increasing participation sets the stage for a potentially explosive move. If bulls can maintain control above $3,500, Ethereum could be gearing up for a fresh leg higher in the short term. As the market awaits confirmation, all eyes are on ETH to see whether this momentum can drive it toward new 2025 highs. The coming week could prove pivotal for Ethereum’s medium-term trend. Ethereum Open Interest Hits Record ATH Ethereum’s market setup continues to strengthen, with open interest in ETH derivatives reaching a new all-time high of $50 billion, according to CryptoQuant data shared by analyst Ted Pillows. “Buckle up and enjoy the Ethereum ride,” Pillows stated, highlighting the elevated volatility ahead as a potential springboard for aggressive price action. This level of open interest is historically significant and often signals that large players are positioning for a major move. Such a dramatic increase in capital committed to ETH futures and options suggests rising investor confidence and heightened anticipation of directional momentum. While high open interest can lead to either a sharp rally or a correction, current on-chain and macro fundamentals indicate that the market may be leaning bullish. Ethereum’s network growth remains steady, with rising active addresses, validator participation, and increased activity on Layer 2s. More importantly, the recent passage of the GENIUS Act in the US provides legal clarity for stablecoins and lays the foundation for broader crypto regulation, benefiting Ethereum directly as the base layer for DeFi and real-world asset tokenization.

The move follows a strong rally from late June lows, with the price now up over 70% in less than a month. Importantly, ETH has broken past all major moving averages, including the 50, 100, and 200 SMAs, signaling a shift toward bullish momentum across longer timeframes. Volume has increased significantly during this breakout, reinforcing the strength of the move. The next major resistance lies at $3,742.95, a level that previously acted as a local top earlier in the year. A successful close above this mark could open the door for a retest of the $4,000–$4,200 range.

Holding above this zone is critical to maintain the current bullish structure.

According to Ali, Cardano is approaching a critical resistance level. He noted, “A daily close above $0.85 could propel Cardano $ADA toward the next key resistance at $1.31!” The statement was accompanied by a chart showing ADA trading around $0.74 at the time of the post, having recovered significantly from previous lows near $0.55 earlier in July. The chart depicted ADA’s strong upward movement in recent weeks, with clear horizontal resistance lines marked at approximately $0.85 and $1.31. The price is currently testing levels last seen in late May, with momentum carrying it above intermediate support zones near $0.68. A daily close above $0.85 could propel Cardano $ADA toward the next key resistance at $1.31! pic.twitter.com/RVgw3yE9lr — Ali (@ali_charts) July 17, 2025 Ali’s analysis suggested that surpassing $0.85 with a decisive daily close could signal a continuation of this upward trend, potentially targeting the next resistance level at $1.31. Community Voices Differing Expectations In response to Ali’s technical outlook, several users on X provided their perspectives on ADA’s future trajectory . A user identified as Delfina Reds expressed skepticism about ADA maintaining gains beyond $1. In her reply, she stated , “When it hits $1, many will take profits, instead of going to $1.3. $ADA will return to cents again. that’s the fate of $ADA.” This comment reflects a common concern among market participants that profit-taking at round psychological levels like $1 could lead to a reversal in price before reaching higher targets. Another user, İyiniyetli, raised a more cautionary question about the nature of the current rally. Addressing Ali, he wrote , “As one of the few trustworthy individuals, I’d like to ask you: Could this entire ascension process be an exit liquidity? Could the people shouting ‘bull’ soon be proven wrong?” This remark implies doubt about the sustainability of the rally and whether it may be driven by larger holders exiting their positions while retail investors buy in at higher levels. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Context Supports Careful Monitoring The debate among users underscores the uncertainty that remains in the market despite ADA’s recent strength. Since hitting multi-month lows in late June, Cardano has posted a sharp recovery, gaining more than 30% over the past few weeks. However, resistance levels near $0.85 remain unbroken, and historically, ADA has struggled to maintain upward momentum after testing psychological thresholds such as $1. Ali’s observation draws attention to this technical barrier as a potential turning point for the asset. His view highlights the importance of closing above $0.85 on the daily timeframe to validate bullish continuation. Until such a breakout occurs, price action may remain volatile and prone to reversals, as some community members have cautioned. Analyst’s Insight Shapes Market Watch Ali’s analysis emphasizes the significance of key technical levels for traders and investors monitoring ADA’s progress. While the $0.85 resistance and subsequent $1.31 target are clear milestones on the chart, the differing opinions from market participants reflect the cautious optimism and skepticism that often accompany strong rallies. According to Ali, the daily close remains the primary signal to watch for confirmation of the trend, as the current upward move approaches a critical test. The next few trading sessions will be crucial in determining whether Cardano can decisively break through resistance and continue toward higher levels or if profit-taking and broader market sentiment will cap the rally. As Ali has suggested, the $0.85 level serves as the immediate focal point for ADA’s potential continuation. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In a notice to the Office of the Maine Attorney General, The Alcohol & Drug Testing Service (TADTS) says a cybersecurity incident has exposed the data of 748,763 individuals. According to TADTS, an unauthorized entity gained access to its data systems and stole information provided to the firm during the screening process, which may include names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license numbers, government-issued IDs, bank and financial entries, credit and debit card records, usernames and passwords, email accounts and passwords, USCIS or alien registration numbers and biometric datasets. “On July 9, 2024, TADTS became aware of a potential compromise to data maintained in our systems. As soon as we discovered this activity, we immediately took steps to investigate, contain, and remediate the situation, including changing passwords, enhancing our endpoint detection protocols, and engaging experienced privacy and cybersecurity professionals to assist. We also reported this matter to federal law enforcement. Through additional investigation, we confirmed that some of our data had been downloaded by an unauthorized actor.” TADTS is a Texas-based firm that offers a nationwide network of collection sites for workplace and individual drug and alcohol screening. The firm urges impacted individuals to be on the lookout for signs of identity theft and fraud. TADTS also says that victims may get one free credit report annually from each of the three major credit reporting bureaus. For now, TADTS says that it has not received reports of identity theft and fraud related to the data breach.

India-based cryptocurrency exchange CoinDCX suffered a $44.2 million cyberattack approximately 17 hours ago, according to blockchain analyst ZachXBT. While the incident has not yet been officially announced to the public, CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta made a statement on social media. ZachXBT stated that the attacker's address was funded with 1 ETH via Tornado Cash, and that some of the stolen assets were transferred from Solana to the Ethereum network. The first sign of the attack was detected by blockchain security platform Cyvers. ZachXBT explained that the CoinDCX hot wallet used by the attacker was not publicly tagged and was identified through manual analysis of the address.

Ripple’s post underscored RLUSD’s focus on security, compliance, and scalability for global businesses. The company expressed appreciation for Bluechip, an independent stablecoin rating agency, which assigned RLUSD an “A” rating and recognized it as the most trusted stablecoin in the market. Ripple wrote: “Built for enterprise use cases, $RLUSD delivers the security, compliance, and scale global businesses demand. We appreciate @bluechip_org’s A rating and recognition of $RLUSD as the market’s most trusted stablecoin.” Built for enterprise use cases, $RLUSD delivers the security, compliance, and scale global businesses demand. We appreciate @bluechip_org ’s A rating and recognition of $RLUSD as the market’s most trusted stablecoin. https://t.co/431ysEVEVU — Ripple (@Ripple) July 18, 2025 Bluechip Rates RLUSD as Its Highest-Ranked Stablecoin In its announcement, Bluechip shared that RLUSD has become the highest-ranked stablecoin on its platform. Bluechip’s tweet stated: “The highest-rated stablecoin on Bluechip has never changed. But today, RLUSD becomes the new #1 ranked stablecoin. Bluechip is beginning coverage for RLUSD by @Ripple with an initial rating of A. This reflects our view that RLUSD is one of the safest stablecoins available.” The detailed ratings report, attached to Bluechip’s post, provides a breakdown of RLUSD’s performance across several key criteria. The agency assessed RLUSD with a stability score of 0.91, categorizing it as stable. Management received a score of 0.84, and governance was rated at 0.86, both assessed as very low risk. Bluechip’s report described RLUSD as backed by US Treasury bills, government money market funds, and bank deposits, which it noted are assets with low credit and duration risks. RLUSD is also regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services , placing it under stringent regulatory oversight. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Custody, Segregation, and Institutional Access Highlighted in Report The Bluechip report further outlined the institutional safeguards supporting RLUSD. According to the findings, reserves are held by the Bank of New York Mellon, which is described as the largest custodian of financial securities globally and classified as a systemically important financial institution. Reserves are also maintained in segregated accounts to protect token holders in the event of issuer bankruptcy. Institutional users can mint and redeem RLUSD directly through Ripple , while retail users can access the stablecoin through secondary markets. These factors contributed to Bluechip’s overall positive assessment and its assignment of an “A” rating, positioning RLUSD at the top of Bluechip’s stablecoin rankings. Industry Commentary Welcomes RLUSD’s Recognition The announcement also drew comments from members of the digital asset community. An X user, Xaif, responded to Ripple’s post with the observation: “Big moves from RLUSD. Built for enterprise-grade utility, security, compliance, and scale all in one. An A rating from @bluechip_org just confirms what we already knew — the most trusted stablecoin on the market.” Ripple and Bluechip’s coordinated statements reflect RLUSD’s intended positioning as a stablecoin designed to meet the demands of institutional and enterprise users, with a focus on regulatory compliance and risk management. Bluechip’s independent evaluation affirmed that RLUSD meets its standards for safety and reliability in the stablecoin sector.

In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a DeFi ecosystem that not only runs on powerful blockchain infrastructure but also allows users to earn real returns. While DOT focuses on protocol interoperability, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) centers its design on giving users control over their capital, stable yields, and flexible lending options. The shift toward utility-backed income protocols is becoming more visible—and Mutuum is positioning itself as a major contender. Polkadot (DOT) Stagnation Post 2021 Since its all-time high of $55.08 in November 2021, Polkadot (DOT) has faced persistent stagnation, trading at $4.23 as of July 17, 2025, down 92% from its peak. Despite its innovative Layer-0 architecture enabling blockchain interoperability, DOT’s price has languished, dropping to a 5-year low of $3.25 in April 2025. The 2021 bull run, driven by parachain auctions and market hype, faded in 2022’s bear market, with DOT closing at $4.31. Despite upgrades like Polkadot (DOT) 2.0’s coretime marketplace and partnerships with Cardano (ADA) and Centrifuge, weak marketing and low TVL have hampered momentum. X posts note a brief rally to $11 in 2024, but bearish technicals, including a falling MACD and RSI, signal ongoing weakness. Analysts predict a potential rebound to $9.87-$13.90 by Q4 2025 if ETF approval lands, though a drop to $2.92 remains possible. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Stablecoin Strategy Built on Real Assets One of the most innovative features of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its decentralized stablecoin system. The protocol is developing a model where only approved issuers will be able to mint the native $1-pegged stablecoin, and only when backed by fully overcollateralized assets like ETH. These stablecoins will be created when users borrow against their collateral and automatically burned when loans are repaid or liquidated—ensuring tight supply control and system solvency without excess inflation. To maintain the $1 peg, Mutuum’s governance will actively manage the borrowing interest rate. If the stablecoin trades above $1, the rate will be lowered to encourage more borrowing. If it falls below $1, the rate will increase to reduce borrowing and support demand. This governance-controlled interest model, combined with natural arbitrage mechanisms, creates a reliable price anchor—solving challenges that have undermined other algorithmic stablecoins. Presale Momentum and P2P Lending Power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already reached an important presale milestone in Phase 5, with over $12.6 million raised and 85% of available tokens sold at $0.03. Over 13,600 holders have joined so far, and with the price set to rise to $0.035 in the next phase, demand is accelerating. With a final presale price of $0.06 and post-launch projections pointing to $0.30, the upside is still significant. For example, an investor who entered during Phase 2 at $0.015 using 1,000 ADA (valued around $0.40 at that time, totaling $400) would have received roughly 26,666.67 MUTM tokens. At today’s price of $0.03, their holdings are already worth $800, reflecting a 2X paper gain. If MUTM hits its projected target of $0.30, that same position would be worth $8,000—a 20X return on the original $400 investment. This kind of upside is exactly why early movers are holding tight and why new investors are scrambling to enter before the next price jump. Alongside its core Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending pools, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is developing a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending model that will allow users to negotiate loan terms directly. Once launched, this feature is expected to be ideal for holders of volatile tokens like PEPE. For instance, a user could potentially pledge their $3,500 worth of PEPE tokens as collateral and borrow 1,200 USDC, all secured through trustless smart contracts. The vision is to create a fully decentralized environment where borrowers and lenders can agree on interest rates and repayment schedules—without any centralized oversight. Layer-2 Speed, mtToken Flexibility, and Bulletproof Security Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will run on a Layer-2 infrastructure, enabling lower fees and faster transaction times—resolving the friction many users face in traditional DeFi platforms. When users lend assets like USDT or SOL, they will receive mtTokens (e.g., mtUSDT or mtSOL), which will grow in value automatically over time. There is no need for manual compounding or re-depositing. These tokens will serve as proof of deposit and can even be used as collateral for further borrowing, increasing capital efficiency. To ensure safety and trust, the project is backed by a 95 Token Security Score from CertiK, along with a 77.5 Skynet rating. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program to reward users who identify vulnerabilities. Additionally, the project is conducting a $100,000 giveaway —offering $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each to ten early believers. While Polkadot (DOT) focuses on scaling and ecosystem connectivity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is targeting what investors are really seeking: stable growth, passive income, and meaningful token utility. With development aligned for the platform’s beta launch and rapid token sellouts pushing prices higher, the road to $0.30 is now clearly visible—and the chance to catch a 2000% breakout is still very much alive.

Moreover, it is custom built with special integrations to support decentralized exchange (DEX) formats. Built on the Cosmos Tendermint platform to secure records using a Delegated Proof of Stake method, SEI is a super fast system for blockchain settlement. “I’ve been saying this for weeks $SEI really giving those early $SOL vibes. Can’t ignore that momentum,” wrote one crypto enthusiast on the X app Monday. SEI Tokens At A Glance The Sei economy has a limited supply hard-capped at 10 billion. But new tokens continue to enter the market with the current circulating supply just south of 6 billion. So token scarcity is a support factor in its price growth, similar to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin. Over the past 30 days, the cryptocurrency is up by more than 111%, making it one of the best performers from the top 100 coins by means of total market capitalization. Meanwhile, Ethereum prices posted 20% returns over the past seven days and around 42% for the 30-day window, with a surge in leveraged trading. But here are 3 bullish signs that SEI could outperform ETH in Q3. 1. Bullish Sei Price Technical Markers In July Sei’s technical setup on the price chart is promising in July. The graph appears to be forming a 5-month cup and handle pattern with the left side starting on Jan. 30 and completing on Jun. 24. Cup and handles often signal a rally. Last week, the handle formed and launched into a bullish test of the Jan. 30 price level around $0.34. This pattern is a little odd because its outer bounds are marked only by brief tests of support by market bears, instead of a bold trace of the cup shape. But there are enough dots to connect from SEI price lows on 2/6, 3/11, 4/8, and 6/17 for the pattern to be readily visible on the chart. Sei Chart Analysis: $SEI is looking strong and any dip into the FVG zone could lead to a significant move upward. Circle’s USDC integration on sei will bring new liquidity and attract new users to the ecosystem with the growing momentum & solid fundamentals a move to $0.50… pic.twitter.com/zH5sqg7d27 — peblo.escobar (@pebloescobarSEI) July 14, 2025 Meanwhile, daily trading volume declined toward the later side of the graph until the right side of the cup began to form as it usually goes with these market movements. Markets are licking their chops for SEI tokens in July. The massive surge in 24-hour trade volume to nearly $1 billion on 6/23 as the cup began to form signals major interest in this coin. Sei is still relatively new with an Aug. 2023 rollout and it has the familiar markers of new projects poised for over-indexed gains on the coattails of Bitcoin’s price rallies. The altcoin erupted from $0.1776 per token to over $1.04 for a 511% ROI in under 7 months from Aug. 2023 to Mar. 2024. Since then the price has adjusted downward in a bullish long-term falling wedge pattern altcoin markets have seen several times before from big winners among new currencies. The trend lines for this falling wedge converge around Jun. 15 as the 5-month cup and handle pattern began to round out into a stout rally for SEI. 2. Sei Integrates USDC Stablecoin To +22% Pump One major impetus for the delta on Sei ROIs over the recent spans is its integration of the Circle stablecoin USDC on its platform. Sei is a Layer-1 blockchain currency and an Ethereum rival for smart contract development and decentralized finance or DeFi. The addition of a $60 billion market cap stablecoin excited SEI bulls. Because crypto users, developers, and traders use stablecoins to trade cryptos against a currency with a stable US dollar peg, support for USDC on the platform opens up massive liquidity channels for SEI markets. It also makes Sei easier to work with for institutional investors, with traditional finance rapidly adopting the blockchain solution for stable currency in 2025. After announcing the USDC integration last week, SEI’s price surged 22% in 24 hours. 3. Strong SEI Fundamentals in Q3 2025 Sei bulls are pushing the narrative on social media that it’s the next DeFi project to deliver the eye-popping kind of gains that Solana did in 2024. $SEI just set a new all-time high for Total Value Locked, climbing past $625 million. More capital flowing in, more on-chain activity picking up – the SEI ecosystem’s clearly pulling in fresh attention. pic.twitter.com/xqruXfoqVn — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) July 7, 2025 The fundamentals of business on its network are shaping up to back that proposition. The first week in July, the total value locked (TVL) for SEI coins staked to secure the currency’s blockchain and stabilize its market hit a new all time high. It clocked in above $625 million in TVL, according to data from Defi Llama. That prompted popular Crypto Banter host Kyledoops to write in a post on X, “More capital flowing in, more on-chain activity picking up – the SEI ecosystem’s clearly pulling in fresh attention.” Meanwhile, Yei Finance, an automated money markets platform built on Sei eclipsed the $400 million mark in total value locked on Jul. 11. Between Sei and Yei, that’s now over a billion worth of currency locked into the Sei ecosystem in July.

This news comes amid the debates over what the asset is best suited for. Some believe it is better for everyday payments, while others are still adamant that it satisfies the conditions to be a store of value. Over the past few years, there have been several enthusiasts who have felt Bitcoin is no longer a regular digital asset, considering the fact that the asset’s value has been quite stable since it launched. To make it more appealing, users of the biggest crypto network can now pay as low as 0.1 satoshi per virtual byte (sat/vByte) to process their transactions. A satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin, with 1 satoshi currently standing at about 0.00000001 BTC. Bitcoin minimum transaction fee drops by 90% According to previous records, miners usually need to pay 1 satoshi/vByte as minimum fees to process their transactions. But because the leading digital assets network has been lacking in activities for a while, miners have decided to cut the minimum rate down by 905 in order to add more blocks to the blockchain. This refers to the weight of a transaction and how fast it will be processed. When the blockchain is busy, it will typically cost more to have miners prioritize your transactions. This latest development shows that demand for block space has dropped drastically. In other words, people are no longer making as many transactions as they used to, pushing miners to consider accepting lower fees. The Bitcoin network is run mainly by miners, which today mostly comprises industrial operations of warehouses full of sophisticated computers that process transactions on the network. Miners earn rewards by processing blocks, which contain transaction data, and adding them to the blockchain. For every block that is processed, miners are open to rewards of up to 3.125 BTC, which is currently worth around $367,000 at the current price, along with transaction fees. But as fewer people carry out transactions like sending funds, Ordinals inscriptions (NFTs), or other actions, transaction fees have been forced to remain low, which means miners earn less for every successful block they win. Prominent BTC proponents bemoan drop in network activity According to a pseudonymous Bitcoin miner Econoalchemist, transactions at the 0.1 sat/vByte fee rate have always been acceptable by most miners in the protocol. However, he noted that some node operators may choose to ignore such low fees. With Mempool and others now pushing the low fees, it means that there is a growing consensus among them towards accepting these kinds of transactions. “Over time, policy rules will trend toward matching consensus rules, lifting most relay restrictions,” he said. Prominent personalities in the payments and crypto space have previously lamented the slow rate of transactions on the blockchain, with former Twitter boss and Square CEO Jack Dorsey being the latest. Dorsey, a big fan of Bitcoin, said that the cryptocurrency would only succeed if people use it for sending and receiving money as it was designed for. “I think if it doesn’t transition to payments and find that everyday use case, it just gets increasingly irrelevant,” Dorsey said during a podcast in April. While Bitcoin has not been used for sending and receiving money like most people believe, it is currently satisfying another use case: individuals and firms are using it as a store of value. This action has propelled the asset to new all-time highs. “I suppose time will tell, but Bitcoin seems to be moving into [a store of value asset] and not being used for any type of transactions,” Scott Norris, CEO of Bitcoin miner Optiminer, said. Even with this new development, the sender of a crypto transaction can still choose the fee. This means that if they are in a hurry to get a payment seen and processed on time by miners, they can just increase the fee, and it will be added to a block quicker. Meanwhile, some users on X have expressed delight at how cheap it was to use the blockchain. “I love seeing sub-1 sat/vbyte transactions in my Mempool,” adding that he wanted to “pay as little as possible,” a user wrote.

Authorities are charging Florida residents Robert R. Rosales Rivero and Geniver Antonio Pinuela Testa with conspiracy to commit bank theft and bank theft in violation of federal law for allegedly draining $107,635 from multiple Isabella Bank ATMs, reports MLive. An affidavit by a Homeland Security special agent alleges that the duo executed an “ATM jackpotting” operation in a single day, infecting the hard drives of Isabella Bank ATMs with malware to trick the machines into releasing cash. The agent says the ploy involves one person using a key to open an ATM and applying glue on its sensors before leaving for a short period to wait for the adhesive to take effect. The person would return to either change the ATM’s hard drive or use a device to corrupt its system. The other half of the duo would subsequently arrive with a mobile phone and a keyboard to control the machine to dispense cash. The alleged thieves were careful not to leave any trace of tampering. Isabella Bank’s surveillance video footage shows that four ATM locations across Michigan were hit between 1 a.m. and 8:09 p.m. on September 22nd. Using facial recognition software, authorities identified Testa as a potential suspect. He had been cited earlier this year for speeding while driving a 2011 Toyota Yaris. The lead helped police locate the alleged thieves in Minnesota, where they pulled over a Yaris with Testa and Rivero as occupants. Inside the car, authorities found a superglue, ATM keys, a mobile phone, a laptop and an electronic device. The police also searched the duo’s hotel room, where they found about $8,000 in cash, latex gloves, a flash drive and a hard drive. Testa and Rivero were charged in Minnesota but managed to post bail. Rivero is now in custody following a court appearance, while Testa remains at large. Both are Venezuelan nationals who arrived in the US legally. Isabella Bank has 35 branches across Michigan and $2.1 billion in total assets.

Jesse McWaters, the company’s head of global policy, even described the stablecoin regulation as a driver of institutional involvement and opportunity for a clearer, more secure regulatory environment for crypto. The GENIUS Act permits licensed banks and corporations to launch stablecoins pegged to the US dollar, as long as they meet rigorous reserve requirements, disclosures, and regulatory compliance requirements. Mastercard says it’s prepared for the stablecoin framework Mastercard noted it had laid the groundwork for several years to welcome the stablecoin regulation. The firm claimed it engaged with players across the crypto and conventional finance landscapes to better understand how stablecoins and other digital assets might enhance today’s payment infrastructure. It stated that it also invested in infrastructure, strategic partnerships , and standards to allow for responsible stablecoin growth. It added that Mastercard Multi-Token Network and Mastercard Crypto Credential platforms will oversee settlement processes, strengthen safety measures, and support regulatory adherence while retaining the programmability and flexibility that make stablecoins valuable. McWaters also noted that for meaningful adoption of stablecoins moving forward, trusted platforms have to take up the assets. Major corporations like Amazon and Apple are considering investments in stablecoins. Moreover, top executives at JPMorgan, Citigroup, and Bank of America have hinted at similar plans. Several banks are reportedly discussing a partnership with Zelle to issue a joint stablecoin. Analysts are worried that the GENIUS ACT may do more harm than good Summer Mersinger, CEO of the Blockchain Association, also commended the GENIUS Act for its targeted and purpose-built approach to stablecoin regulation. He argued that the law paves the way for regulatory clarity to ensure consumer protection, promote innovation, and strengthen the US dollar’s influence in digital finance. However, Corey Frayer, the director of Investor Protection for the Consumer Federation of America, criticized the stablecoin law, saying “The reason you would never recommend grandmother use a stablecoin is she would have to give away a dollar that’s protected by the federal government and deposit insurance, and which comes with a ton of consumer protections, and which pays interest in her banking account, in exchange for a stablecoin that doesn’t have any of those things.” According to Frayer, the GENIUS Act lets stablecoin issuers sidestep traditional banking safeguards and operate with minimal oversight, which historically has never ended well. Moreover, there are still concerns that stablecoins may not actually reduce back-end operational costs . So far, most companies have stated that they intend to use stablecoins primarily for back-end functions, such as lowering merchant fees paid to credit card networks or simplifying currency conversions in cross-border transactions. Some of those who questioned the value of stablecoins raised issues about President Trump and his family’s involvement in the space. Their ties to World Liberty Financial have drawn attention, especially since they have made over $500 million since the platform’s inception. Critics have also cautioned that the GENIUS Act could flood the market with privately issued stablecoins, leaving consumers to juggle different currencies at every retailer. Some suggested a centralized app could fix the problem, but it would require users to set up their own crypto wallets, adding another layer of hassle and hacking risks.

Trading for less than a dollar, XYZVerse could be the overlooked opportunity investors are seeking. Delving into its potential might unveil why it stands poised to surge in the forthcoming market boom. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Is a 30x Jump Possible? XYZVerse has entered the meme coin market at a time when community-driven tokens continue to dominate speculative trading. The rise of meme coins like PEPE , Dogwifhat , and Bonk proves that strong branding, viral marketing, and community engagement can drive massive gains. The broader market sentiment also plays a key role in XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season is about to start, lower-cap meme coins are seeing increased investor interest. Given that XYZVerse is still in presale, it could benefit from this wave if it secures strategic exchange listings and maintains community hype post-launch. Key Strengths of XYZVerse in the Current Market: Strong branding with sports and influencer partnerships, broadening its appeal Deflationary mechanics (17.13% token burn) to reduce supply pressure Liquidity allocation (15%) to support stability after launch Community incentives (10%) fostering engagement and holding Price Prediction for $XYZ Current Presale Price: $0.003333 Projected Post-Presale Target: $0.10 (as per project’s estimates) Potential ATH (First 1-2 Weeks Post-Launch): $0.15 – $0.25 (if demand surges and listings drive FOMO) Long-Term Potential (6-12 Months): $0.20 – $0.40 (if the project secures major partnerships and listings) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x jump from presale to $0.10 is possible but depends on: Strong Exchange Listings – If XYZVerse lands on major CEX platforms like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price could skyrocket on launch day. Sustained Community Growth – Meme coins need viral momentum. If XYZVerse delivers on its sports influencer partnerships, it could drive massive social media engagement. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges Terra Classic (LUNC) Source: TradingView Terra Classic (LUNC) has shown signs of recovery in the past week, with a price increase of 6.81%. Over the past month, it climbed 7.06%, indicating a steady upward trend. However, looking at the last six months, the coin has declined by 39.83%, reflecting earlier challenges. The current price ranges between $0.00005732 and $0.00006743. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $0.00006395 and $0.00006309 respectively. The Relative Strength Index is at 53.91, suggesting the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. The MACD level is slightly positive, hinting at potential bullish momentum. Terra Classic faces immediate resistance at $0.00007161. If it surpasses this level, it could aim for the second resistance at $0.00008172, an increase of about 22%. On the downside, support is at $0.00005139. A drop below this could see it test the second support at $0.00004128, a decrease of around 27%. The stochastic value of 43.51 supports a neutral outlook, leaving room for movement in either direction. Stellar (XLM) Source: TradingView Stellar (XLM) has seen significant price movement recently. In the past week, its price jumped 60.95%, showing strong short-term momentum. Over the last month, it increased by 78.06%, indicating sustained growth. However, over six months, the price dipped by 4.62%, reflecting some long-term volatility. Based on this data, there’s potential for further price rise. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 53.73, suggesting the asset is neither overbought nor oversold. The Simple Moving Averages for both 10 and 100 days are at $0.46, pointing to a consistent trend. The MACD level of 0.0014 indicates a slight upward momentum. If the upward trend continues, XLM might reach the nearest resistance level at $0.64. This would be an increase from its current range of $0.32–$0.55, potentially up by around 16% or more. Breaking past this, the second resistance level at $0.87 could be the next target, offering additional growth potential. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $0.16, which could act as a safety net if prices fall. TRON (TRX) Source: TradingView TRON (TRX) has been on an impressive run lately, posting significant gains across multiple time frames. In the past week, the cryptocurrency has risen by 7.38%. Over the last month, it has climbed by 13.61%, and in the past six months, TRX has increased by 25.03%. These consistent upward movements suggest growing investor confidence and a strong market performance. Currently, TRX is trading within a range of $0.2894 to $0.3116, inching closer to its nearest resistance level at $0.3204. A successful breakout above this point could propel the price toward the second resistance level at $0.3425, representing an approximate 10% gain from current levels. Alternatively, if the price faces downward pressure, support levels at $0.2761 and $0.2540 may provide stability. Technical indicators reinforce the bullish outlook for TRON. The 10-day Simple Moving Average sits at $0.3105, slightly above the 100-day SMA of $0.3025, signaling a positive trend. The Relative Strength Index is at 64.18, indicating that the asset is not yet overbought and may have room for further growth. The Stochastic oscillator reads 82.45, suggesting strong momentum. Additionally, the MACD level of 0.0024843 points to continued upward movement. Based on these indicators, TRX may be poised to climb higher, potentially breaking through resistance levels in the near future.

His post on X urged those holding Bitcoin to reconsider their strategy if their goal is to accumulate more BTC over time. “Don’t buy XRP bro, buy Bitcoin bro. Bitcoin is decentralized bro,” he wrote, mocking the typical response of Bitcoin supporters. He followed with a sharp counterpoint, stating, “Yet XRP has already delivered & will continue to deliver a higher ROI than Bitcoin this cycle. ROI is all that matters.” ""Don't buy XRP bro, buy Bitcoin bro. Bitcoin is decentralized bro."" Yet XRP has already delivered & will continue to deliver a higher ROI than Bitcoin this cycle. ROI is all that matters. Fuck your Bitcoin. If you really wanted more Bitcoin… You'll sell your Bitcoin for… — 𓂀 (@PharaohX33) July 19, 2025 XRP Outpaces Bitcoin in ROI Return on investment (ROI) is the percentage gain or loss on an asset relative to its initial cost. It provides a clear measure of how effectively capital has grown over time. The numbers lend weight to PharaohX33’s argument, as XRP has performed significantly better. In November 2024, XRP opened at $0.5092 while Bitcoin stood at $70,216.90. XRP has since surged to an all-time high of $3.65 , representing an approximately 616% increase. In comparison, Bitcoin’s climb to $123,091.61 marks a gain of about 75%. This stark contrast reinforces PharaohX33’s view that XRP has outperformed BTC so far in this market cycle. Beyond price action, XRP’s network activity also shows significant momentum. Active XRP addresses have increased by 490% since 2022 , indicating rising adoption and engagement with the ecosystem. Bitcoin’s active addresses, by contrast, have only seen a 10% increase in the same period. This difference highlights how user activity regarding XRP is accelerating at a far greater pace. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Best Investment Choice He added, “If you really wanted more Bitcoin, you’ll sell your Bitcoin for XRP… and sell your XRP for more Bitcoin later on.” Other experts have also highlighted XRP’s ability to outperform Bitcoin in terms of ROI, showing how a $2 increase for XRP could mean significantly more than a $20,000 increase for BTC. PharaohX33’s unapologetic tone reflects a growing frustration among XRP advocates who believe their asset’s progress is too often overlooked in favor of Bitcoin’s dominance narrative. With XRP continuing to make strides in both price and network usage, the debate between the two communities is unlikely to subside soon. PharaohX33’s message cuts through the noise with one clear assertion. For anyone looking to earn from their crypto investments by holding more BTC, the best option is to buy XRP and swap it for BTC later, as XRP offers more growth despite criticism from Bitcoin maximalists .

A popular market analyst with the X username PlanD has weighed in on these recent market developments, highlighting three factors that would confirm the presence of an altseason. Related Reading: Why Bitcoin Price Failed To Break $123,000 In The Past Week — Analyst Explains A BTC.D Retest At 63% May Mark Crucial Altseason Moment – Analyst Over the last week, a bullish rise in the altcoin market cap to $1.45 trillion sparked widespread speculations about the current status of the altseason. Interestingly, in an X post on July 19, PlanD outlines three market events that will signal the altseason’s commencement, namely a potential pullback in both Bitcoin and Ethereum, alongside a critical technical development in Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D). Following Bitcoin’s ascent beyond $121,000 and Ethereum’s price rise above $3,400, PlanD says the first two signals to watch for are healthy corrections in these assets’ prices. Specifically, the analyst explains that pullbacks toward the $111,000 and $3,250 regions for Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively, present an ideal situation that would allow capital to rotate from Bitcoin into altcoins, effectively causing a decline in BTC.D. Far from indicating weakness, PlanD says this retracement could actually catalyze the rise broader crypto market. Notably, if Ethereum finds support at $3,250, the ETH/BTC pair could strengthen, creating a favorable setup for altcoin rallies. This is because a stronger ETH/BTC pair is often a precursor to altcoin outperformance, as it signals increased investor appetite beyond Bitcoin. The third and perhaps most pivotal signal is unfolding in Bitcoin dominance. After months of holding above a rising support trendline, Plan D notes BTC.D has broken below it, signaling a potential change in market structure. However, the next test lies at the 63.40% dominance level. Should BTC.D retest this zone and fail to reclaim it, the analyst believes a new downtrend in dominance may begin, i.e., presenting the largest hallmark of altseason. In case of this scenario, PlanD also tells investors to expect strong bullish momentum in tokens linked to sectors such as real-world Assets (RWA), artificial Intelligence (AI), and gaming beyond the large and medium-cap tokens on popular blockchains.

Importantly, the altseason index ranks at 42, indicating a rising momentum in the market’s favor for altcoins.

This breakout comes as Bitcoin surged to a fresh all-time high of $122,838 which shows renewed interest across the altcoin market. Meanwhile, on the Move-based chains front, SUI crypto has quietly rallied above key resistance levels which shows robust on-chain growth and staking activity. A rising newcomer with a cross-chain DeFi project focus, it hints at the kind of innovation that could fuel the next altcoin uptrend. Solana Price Breakout: SOL Soars Past $170, Eyes $2,700 Analysts have highlighted a classic cup-and-handle formation on Solana’s daily chart, with a decisive weekly close above $170 marking the official breakout. This pattern, which began forming after the 2022 downturn, suggests SOL could test Fibonacci targets at $295, $787, $1,314, and ultimately $2,700. Experts have also observed that Solana is consolidating in an ascending triangle below $170, with trendline support from $142. The MFI currently sits neutral at 48.66, with no clear inflow or outflow bias. A potential spot SOL ETF approval (odds at 99%) and growing institutional holdings lend further bullish impetus. SUI Crypto Gains Momentum: TVL Climbs, $5 in Sight SUI Crypto has broken above $3.50, signalling strong bullish intent and marking a critical resistance flip. On-chain metrics show SUI’s Total Value Locked climbing to $1.87 billion which shows growing DeFi activity. Experts have noticed that SUI crypto is close to a big breakout . It is currently pushing against key $4.11 resistance, the last stop before testing the ATH. With its developer-friendly Move language and scalable parallel processing, SUI Crypto stands out among Layer-1s and cross-chain DeFi project contenders looking to dethrone older networks.

In a post on the social media platform X, Scott Bessent says that the greenback will embrace the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies following President Donald Trump’s signing of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act. The law sets strict regulatory standards for banks and qualified stablecoin issuers to ensure the secure and transparent issuance of payment stablecoins. “Blockchain technologies will power the next generation of payments, and the US dollar is coming on-chain. Thanks to President Trump’s visionary leadership, and Senator Hagerty’s important work in Congress, the GENIUS Act will help cement the US dollar as the global reserve currency for generations to come.” Bloomberg reports that during a White House ceremony on Friday, Trump said the bill’s passage marks a major leap forward for US financial technology. “The Genius Act creates a clear and simple regulatory framework to establish and unleash the immense promise of dollar-backed stablecoins.

The Home Office has announced a tender for the storage and sale of confiscated cryptocurrencies; the contract is valued at $53.7 million. The proceeds from the sale are expected to be transferred to the Treasury. UK authorities plan to sell at least 61,000 BTC (about $7 billion at the time of the announcement). The assets were confiscated after the uncovering of a financial pyramid scheme linked to a Chinese citizen, according to The Telegraph . In early 2024, British police confiscated 61,000 BTC connected to a large-scale investment fraud in China. At the same time, the trial of 42-year-old Jian Wen began; he is accused of involvement in laundering funds worth £5 billion. The proceeds from the sale of the bitcoins are expected to go to the Ministry of Finance, which is facing a budget deficit. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, is closely involved in overseeing the process. Simultaneously, the government announced a tender for the storage and sale of confiscated crypto-assets. The contract is valued at £40 million (about $54 million). However, as The Telegraph notes, no suitable bids have been submitted. Reform UK party leader Nigel Farage called for the UK to create a national bitcoin reserve, but Labour rejected the idea. The CEO of asset forfeiture company Asset Reality, Aidan Larkin, said:“We have real oil under our feet when it comes to digital assets linked to illegal activity that can generate hundreds of millions of pounds for the UK every year.”",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|ASIA|COMMODITY|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-20 09:21:10

This New DeFi Crypto Could Be the Next 20x Opportunity,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/like-cardano-ada-in-2021-this-new-defi-crypto-could-be-the-next-20x-opportunity/,"Back in 2021, early Cardano (ADA) believers watched a few cents transform into life-changing returns. Fast forward to today, and a similar opportunity is emerging—not in the usual big caps, but in a high-utility DeFi token quietly gaining traction during its presale. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already rewarded its early supporters with a 100% increase from Phase 2’s price of $0.015, and now, as it approaches the final stretch of Phase 5, it’s being whispered about in the same circles that once speculated on ADA’s legendary rise. But unlike 2021’s speculative rallies, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is engineered with a real income-generating backbone and a sharply focused lending platform that introduces fresh value into decentralized finance. The architecture goes beyond token price hype—this is about actual returns on blue-chip crypto holdings. Cardano (ADA) Early Pump in 2021 Cardano (ADA) delivered its most exceptional performance in 2021, skyrocketing 1,520% from $0.1813 to a peak of $2.936 on September 2, per CoinMarketCap. This meteoric rise, outpacing many top cryptocurrencies, was fueled by the Alonzo hard fork in September, which introduced smart contract functionality, enabling DeFi and NFT applications. Strategic partnerships, like the Ethiopia education blockchain deal, and Charles Hoskinson’s active promotion on X (then Twitter) amplified investor enthusiasm. ADA’s market cap soared to $94.8 billion at its peak, briefly ranking it third among cryptocurrencies. The broader crypto bull market, driven by institutional adoption and retail FOMO, propelled ADA’s gains, with trading volumes hitting $4.76 billion daily in August. Despite a year-end dip to $1.31, 2021 cemented Cardano (ADA)’s reputation as a scalable, research-driven blockchain, with Ouroboros PoS drawing academic praise, per CoinDesk. Real DeFi Utility Backed by Yield and Liquidity At the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) lies an upcoming decentralized lending system designed to deliver what the team calls “real yield.” Unlike inflationary reward models that rely on token emissions, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s architecture is being built to route actual interest payments from borrowers to lenders—creating a sustainable income stream for crypto holders who want to keep exposure to their favorite assets. Once live, the protocol’s Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model will allow users to lend crypto like $10,000 worth of SOL, receive 10,000mtSOL in 1:1 in return, and potentially earn up to 18% APY (based on pool utilization)—translating to around $1,800 annually. These mtTokens will be ERC-20 compatible and fully liquid, opening the door to additional DeFi strategies such as staking. It’s passive income reimagined—without relying on third parties or centralized intermediaries. As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues its presale momentum as the project has already attracted over 13,600 holders and raised $12.6 million. Currently, Phase 5 is 85% complete, with the price still at $0.03—but only 15% of supply remains before the next jump to $0.035, marking what many view as the final entry point before public listing. But Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just about passive income. Its Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending system is being developed to unlock real utility from volatile or underused tokens. Once operational, holders of assets like TRUMP, PEPE will be able to use them as collateral for overcollateralized loans. For example, someone with $8,000 in PEPE could secure a $4,000 USDC loan at a 50% LTV—without needing to sell. Borrowers and lenders will negotiate terms directly, setting interest rates, loan durations, and even allowing for partial fills. Since there will be no shared liquidity pool in P2P lending, lenders will take on more risk—but they will also have the potential for higher returns. This structure will preserve the protocol’s overall safety while broadening earning opportunities. CertiK-Verified, Layer-2 Integrated, and Future-Ready While many DeFi platforms launch with minimal attention to security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has placed its reputation in the hands of the industry’s most trusted auditor. Its CertiK review delivered a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 77.5, placing it well above typical presale benchmarks. In parallel, the platform runs a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program to catch any vulnerabilities and reward community-driven security participation. From a performance standpoint, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built on a Layer-2 architecture, meaning users will benefit from lower fees and lightning-fast settlement without sacrificing the trustless nature of Ethereum’s base layer. Adding to its momentum is a $100,000 giveaway campaign that’s already bringing in thousands of new participants. The roadmap now looks to beta testing and public release, followed by exchange listings. The current token price of $0.03 is expected to rise to $0.06 on listing, with price forecasts of $2.5 by 2026—delivering a clean 83x opportunity for those entering now. Early buyers from Phase 1 have already tripled their position, and those who swapped assets like SOL in Phase 2 are comfortably up by 2x. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that in a market full of empty promises, sustainable yield, DeFi flexibility, and security-first design can carve out massive upside. For investors who missed ADA’s legendary breakout, this may be the closest thing the market will offer this cycle.

By 2028, the EOS price value can reach a maximum of $2.63. The EOS price in 2031 could reach a maximum possible level of $4.28 and an average forecast price of $4.12. EOS , a completely decentralized network, favors the evolution and expansion stages of other bigger decentralized applications (dApps). It offers multitudes of benefits in terms of efficiency, user empowerment, and the ability to provide various services. The network has experienced a long series of developments since its initial launch in the cryptocurrency market in 2017. Since then, it has reached new highs, featuring the monumental $4 billion Initial Coin Offering (ICO) as its best. However, it still falls behind in its claim of establishing itself as an “Ethereum Killer”, as its stability has remained questionable. Can EOS reach $10 soon? Let’s get into the EOS price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency EOS Token EOS Price $0.608 (+3.14) Market Cap $956.11M Trading Volume $4.64M Circulating Supply 1.57B EOS All-time High $22.89 (Apr 29, 2018) All-time Low $0.4802 (Oct 23, 2017) 24-hour High $0.6314 24-hour Low $0.5727 EOS price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Volatility 6.14% 50-Day SMA $0.657948 14-Day RSI 72.66 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 72 (Greed) Green Days 17/30 (57%) 200-Day SMA $0.613449 EOS price analysis: EOS faces mixed market sentiment at $0.608 TL;DR Breakdown : EOS price analysis confirmed a slow upward market trend at $0.608. The altcoin gained 3.14% of its value. The EOS coin faces resistance around $0.631. On July 20, 2025, the EOS price analysis revealed a mixed daily trend for the altcoin. The EOS price experienced a marginal gain, reaching $0.608 in the past 24 hours. Overall, the altcoin gained up to 3.14% of its value today, as buyers took over the market, which caused a slight price appreciation. The altcoin was unsuccessful in breaking above the $0.616 local resistance zone earlier today, and it might retest it again during the current trading session if support at $0.600 proves strong. EOS 1-day price chart analysis The one-day price chart of the EOS coin confirmed a slow increasing trend as price oscillations are slowing down. The EOS/USD value stepped up to $0.608 today. A small green candlestick on the price chart signifies a mixed trend. The distance between the Bollinger bands defines the volatility. This distance is increasing, leading to high volatility. Moving ahead, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance band, has shifted to $0.614. Whereby its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $0.447. EOSUSD 1-day price chart. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is present in the overbought area. The indicator’s value has flattened at index 70.53. The straight curve on the RSI graph signifies a tie between buyers and sellers. If buying activities continue to intensify, further stability within the market conditions can be expected. EOS/USD 4-hour price chart The four-hour price analysis of the EOS coin also confirmed the presence of support for the altcoin. The altcoin’s value has increased again to $0.608 as bulls are trying to dominate the price function. Also, the higher levels of volatility mark a higher chance of a reversal in market trends. The Bollinger Bands have expanded, hinting at high volatility. This high level of volatility signifies increased market unpredictability. Moving forward, the upper Bollinger Band has shifted to $0.615, securing the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger Band has moved to $0.546, marking the support. EOSUSD 4-hour price chart. Source: TradingView The RSI indicator is present near the overbought region. Currently at 66.67, the RSI level is increasing from its previous level, confirming the buying activities. The upward-pointing slope on the indicator’s graph refers to significant support from the buying side of the market. If buying activities continue for a few more hours, further appreciation can be expected.

The EOS price analysis gives a mixed prediction with some degree of bullish bias regarding ongoing market events. The EOS/USD value has slightly increased to $0.608 in the past 24 hours. If buyers continue to dominate the price chart, we might see a further increase in price levels to retest the resistance of $0.631 once again. Is EOS a good investment? EOS has seen more green days in the last month. The coin’s price decreased by 16% over the last year. However, the circumstances can change, and a recovery cannot be ruled out. A bullish rally may be expected in the latter part of this year (2025), potentially pushing the EOS near $1. Why is EOS up? Following the recent support around the $0.528 level on the EOS price chart, buyers gained control and took the price to $0.608. Will EOS price recover? If buyers hold the momentum around $0.726 and strongly defend further, we might see a rebound rally in the coming days. Will EOS reach $2? The highest price that EOS observed last year was $1.34 in December; EOS is sweating to break this level. Suppose the broader cryptocurrency market moves in a bullish direction. In that case, EOS may also follow the trend and is expected to reach near the $2 level by the start of 2027 if everything remains favorable. Will EOS reach $5? EOS was last seen above the $5 level in November 2021. Since then, the EOS value has plummeted significantly; however, the coin is expected to surpass $5 again after 2031. Will EOS reach $10? According to the EOS price prediction, EOS may not achieve the $10 level in the next five years. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $10, possibly after 2035. How high could EOS go? EOS is expected to reach a high price of $4.28 by the end of 2031. Is EOS a dead coin? No, EOS is not a dead coin because it still has an active community. EOS has good brand recognition and is the 184th ranked cryptocurrency. It also observed good bullish sentiment in November last year when the entire crypto market turned green. Is EOS a buy or sell? Considering its active community and ongoing development with potential future breakthroughs, EOS looks like a good buy option, despite the fact that it observed some price stagnation in the past. (Remember, this is not investment advice.) Does EOS have a good long-term Future? According to The Motley Fool, a private financial and investing advice company based in Virginia, EOS is a “very risky choice.” The publication says EOS’s future is uncertain, given the scandals and problems surrounding the EOS Foundation and Block—One blockchain company. However, the market speculates that EOS will reach above $4.28 by 2031, but the speculations can change at any time.

EOS historic price sentiment EOS price history In 2018, the EOS ICO made history by raising a staggering $4 billion, the largest initial coin offering ever. After this success, EOS’s cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 5 by market cap. However, by late 2021, the price of the EOS token had fallen from $10 in June 2018 to $4.40 due to a declining user base. In 2022, EOS experienced significant price swings, as per historical data. It peaked at around $3.27, gaining significant market capitalization, and dropped to a low of about $0.81. On average, EOS traded at approximately $1.59. In 2023, EOS saw even lower prices, reaching a maximum price of $1.33. The token dipped to as low as $0.53 between August and September due to less buying of EOS tokens. On average, EOS traded at roughly $0.84 and closed the year at $0.8450. In Q1 2024, EOS’s price fluctuated between $0.65 and $1.30, with the lowest prices in January. By February and March, prices began to stabilize, averaging around $1.02​. EOS reached $1.15 on April 12, 2024, but soon declined below $1, maintaining an average price of about $0.8 throughout May. In June, EOS fell from $0.8142 to $0.5772, while July saw further loss with the token’s value decreasing to $0.4808. However, by mid-July 2024, EOS recovered back to $0.6100, and on August 23, EOS closed at $0.5566. In September 2024, EOS further dipped near the $0.4600 range, while October also observed the same pattern with prices mostly trending near the $0.450 range. Market sentiment changed in November, and a strong bullish trend was observed throughout the month, and the coin peaked at $1.36 on December 6. Following the late December correction, EOS then recovered into 2025 above the $0.766 mark in January but came down to $0.593 in February. In March, EOS dipped down to the $0.456 level, but it recovered back to the $0.85 level at the start of April, and in May, EOS was changing hands at $0.94 when the market sentiment turned bullish. At the start of July 2025, EOS is trading near $0.54 after a price drop, as the current market sentiment is bearish.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|ICO|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ETH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-20 09:30:00

However, market analysts have identified a signal that suggests the asset could see more explosive gains in the coming months. This signal is the BTC golden cross. It always forms when its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) crosses the 200-day equivalent. Golden crosses often precede massive price gains, although this does not happen all the time. Golden Cross Appears Again According to the crypto trader Merlijn, the bitcoin golden cross just appeared , increasing the chances of BTC going parabolic in the coming months. The trader mentioned that BTC ballooned 139% when the cross appeared in 2016 and 2,200% when it showed up in 2017. Bitcoin also surged another 1,190% after the golden cross was spotted in 2020. “Now it’s flashing again in 2025. Same setup. Same signal. Miss this and you’ll remember it forever. Bitcoin is about to leave orbit,” Merlijn stated. Notably, not all golden crosses come with massive rallies. In September 2021, the signal flashed again, but BTC climbed only 50%. Another SMA crossover in October 2023 triggered a 45% rise in bitcoin’s price. These brief surges are often associated with the 50-day SMA failing to remain above its 200-day equivalent for an extended period. Short-lived crosses lead to minimal price spikes, while the long ones can trigger parabolic movements for bitcoin’s value. Bitcoin Fundamentals Stay Positive It is also worth noting that golden crosses do not always precede BTC price spikes. There have been cases where price crashes have followed the cross, primarily due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions. One incident occurred in February 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak, which affected the global financial market, led to a 62% decline in bitcoin’s price after the golden cross appeared. Such experiences highlight the need to factor in broader technical and macro factors when analyzing the golden cross. Currently, analysts believe bitcoin fundamentals will support a sustainable bullish trend. With diminishing supply and rising demand, the chances of the bears taking control over the next few weeks are low. However, market analyst Rekt Capital says BTC needs a daily close above $120,000 and a post-breakout retest to reach new highs. Currently, the asset is consolidating and facilitating money inflow into altcoins.

Key Takeaways: CoinDCX suffered a $44 million hack caused by a server breach. The attack was first flagged by blockchain analyst ZachXBT. The breach follows the 2024 WazirX incident linked to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. The exploit took place early Saturday morning and was first identified nearly 17 hours later by blockchain investigator ZachXBT, who linked the compromised wallet to CoinDCX. “The attacker address was funded with 1 ETH from Tornado Cash and later bridged a portion of the stolen funds from Solana to Ethereum,” ZachXBT wrote on Telegram . CoinDCX Confirms Security Breach Shortly after ZachXBT’s post, CoinDCX CEO Sumit Gupta acknowledged the hack, blaming it on a “sophisticated server breach” that compromised an internal account used for liquidity provisioning on a partner platform. Gupta stressed that customer funds were not affected and that the company would cover the losses from its treasury. “We are collaborating with the exchange partner to block and recover assets, including coming out with a bug bounty program soon,” Gupta stated. He added that the CoinDCX wallets used for customer asset storage were untouched and “completely safe.” Why is a CoinDCX team member telling people to engage with this post and thank you for the “transparency”? Your team waited 17 hours to disclose (not until after it was alerted publicly) pic.twitter.com/jElwOd9IHY — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) July 19, 2025 The incident comes almost exactly a year after the high-profile WazirX hack , which forced the platform offline and ultimately led to the collapse of its proposed restructuring plan. The Lazarus Group, a North Korea-linked hacker syndicate, was later linked to that attack. So far, no group has claimed responsibility for the CoinDCX breach. Founded in 2018, CoinDCX rose to unicorn status in 2021 after raising $90 million at a $1.1 billion valuation. A year later, it raised another $135 million, pushing its valuation to over $2 billion. In July 2024, the firm acquired Dubai-based crypto platform BitOasis, signaling international growth ambitions. CoinDCX Faces Criticism Over Withdrawal Policies Despite its rapid rise, CoinDCX has faced criticism over its withdrawal policies. The platform does not allow crypto withdrawals by default, requiring users to undergo internal risk assessments to unlock the feature. Gupta defended the practice in a Reddit AMA earlier this year, citing concerns over illicit fund movement. Ironically, in the same session, Gupta had expressed confidence in CoinDCX’s security protocols, pointing to its fund safeguarding measures, proof of reserves, and a $7 million insurance pool set aside to protect users in case of a breach. As of June, CoinDCX reported total holdings of $584.2 million and nearly 20 million registered users. Crypto investors lost over $2.2 billion to hacks , scams, and breaches in the first half of 2025, driven largely by wallet compromises and phishing attacks, according to CertiK’s latest security report. Wallet breaches alone caused $1.7 billion in losses across just 34 incidents, while phishing scams accounted for over $410 million across 132 attacks. Two major incidents, including Bybit’s $1.5 billion hack in February and Cetus Protocol’s $225 million exploit in May, skewed the year’s losses upward, together accounting for nearly $1.78 billion.

However, market reports reveal deep-pocketed wallets accumulating certain ETH ecosystem cryptos. Considering Aave’s V4 developments, and the thriving momentum the Remittix DeFi project enjoys with crypto staking deposits and acceptance, they, alongside ETH, have been the token to investors’ support. This article explains why market experts believe the uptrend with these three still has fuel in their tanks. Ethereum Price Prediction as Golden‑Cross Remains Steady The latest Ethereum price predictions confirm market sentiments based on the OG altcoin’s steady golden cross from the previous week. Market charts show that the 50‑day EMA currently sits almost $400 over the 200‑day, a sign of a lasting uptrend. RSI has waned from 80 to 74, lessening overbought pressure while maintaining bullish pressure in the “power zone.” Since the start of the week, LookOnChain data has recorded nearly 82k ETH ($270 M) sent into self‑custody addresses. Analysts believe institutional investors are taking their chance on a bullish Ethereum price prediction with the next target anywhere between $3,500 and $3,750. The next support level is $3,000, with a steeper catch‑net set at $2,500, where prior low-gas-fee crypto rotations started. Source: Tradingview Is AAVE the DeFi Crypto Whales’ Desire? With the recent ETH price cooling off, whales have chosen to move toward AAVE, accumulating 410k of the token in recent days. Relying on the Q3 V4 launch, which combines liquidity across 34 networks and reduces borrowing costs by 30%, AAVE is upgrading and attracting massive interest. Open interest has smashed the January record at $1.44 billion, and capital has turned positive at 0.02%. Provided that bulls can regain $330, the calculated direction from the inverse head‑and‑shoulders pattern suggests $388, which is just the 38% Fib extension of the 2024 rise delivered. Market analysts agree that Aave’s developing GHO stable‑coin markets make it a project with tangible utility and delivering convincing long‑term crypto potential. Source: Tradingview Will Remittix Deliver the Next 100x Crypto Boom? As the market gears up for the next crypto boom, traders seeking the next 100x crypto are throwing support behind Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi fast-riser making dependable FIAT out of blockchain assets. Analysts believe this growth is for the following reasons: Allowing users to enjoy global access to crypto‑to‑FIAT conversion and payments across over 30 currencies with minimal transaction charges This project prioritizes utility, and it plans to add a non‑custodial wallet this quarter. Now, users can convert ETH, BTC, SOL, and even AAVE into fiat in real time. Security is another priority, as the project just received certification by CertiK after a full smart contract audit. When you add its high-flying presale with over $16.5 million raised, the 50% token bonus, and ongoing $250k giveaway with its deflationary burns, you can see why Remittix is expected to be the next 100x crypto.

A staggering 200,000,001 USDT transfer , valued at approximately $200 million, was recently reported by Whale Alert, moving from the centralized exchange HTX to the decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol Aave. This monumental movement of stablecoins isn’t just a transaction; it’s a significant indicator, potentially signaling new strategies from major players or a substantial injection of liquidity into the DeFi ecosystem. Understanding the nuances of such a large USDT transfer is crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic waters of the digital asset space. What Just Happened? Decoding the Massive USDT Transfer The cryptocurrency market is constantly buzzing with activity, but some events stand out more than others. The recent report from Whale Alert detailing a 200,000,001 USDT transfer from HTX to Aave is one such event. For those new to the space, let’s break down the key entities involved: USDT (Tether): This is the world’s largest stablecoin, pegged to the US dollar. Its stability makes it a popular choice for traders and investors looking to move large sums of value without exposure to crypto market volatility. HTX (formerly Huobi): A prominent centralized cryptocurrency exchange, HTX offers a wide range of trading services, including spot trading, derivatives, and more. It acts as a custodian for users’ funds, meaning it holds assets on their behalf. Aave: A leading decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, Aave allows users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies without intermediaries. It operates through smart contracts on various blockchains, enabling users to earn interest on deposits or take out loans against collateral. The sheer volume of this particular USDT transfer – $200 million – immediately flags it as a ‘whale’ movement. In crypto parlance, a ‘whale’ refers to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of cryptocurrency, capable of influencing market dynamics with their transactions. The shift from a centralized exchange like HTX to a DeFi protocol like Aave suggests a strategic decision, likely aimed at leveraging Aave’s unique functionalities for yield generation or liquidity provision. Why Does a $200 Million USDT Transfer Matter for DeFi Liquidity? The movement of such a substantial amount of capital, specifically a USDT transfer of this magnitude, has several ripple effects, particularly for the DeFi ecosystem and Aave’s liquidity. Here’s why it’s more than just a routine transaction: Boosting Aave’s Liquidity: Aave’s core function relies on liquidity pools. When a large sum like $200 million USDT is deposited, it significantly increases the available capital for borrowers. This can lead to lower borrowing rates, making Aave more attractive for those seeking loans, and potentially higher lending rates for depositors due to increased activity. Signaling Institutional or Whale Confidence in DeFi: A transfer of this size often indicates a sophisticated investor or institution is actively engaging with decentralized finance. Their willingness to move significant capital from a trusted centralized entity to a DeFi protocol underscores a growing confidence in the security, efficiency, and yield potential of decentralized platforms. Potential for Yield Farming Strategies: One of the primary reasons for depositing stablecoins like USDT into Aave is to earn passive income through lending. The whale behind this USDT transfer might be looking to capitalize on Aave’s competitive interest rates, which can be dynamic based on supply and demand. This is a common strategy in ‘yield farming,’ where users seek to maximize returns on their crypto assets. Arbitrage Opportunities: While less likely for such a direct transfer, large movements can sometimes be part of a broader arbitrage strategy, exploiting minor price differences for USDT across various platforms or seeking better yield opportunities that might arise momentarily. To better understand the implications, let’s compare the nature of the platforms involved in this significant USDT transfer : Feature HTX (Centralized Exchange) Aave (Decentralized Protocol) Control & Custody Centralized entity holds funds; users don’t control private keys. Users retain control of their assets via private keys; smart contracts manage funds. Intermediary Required for all transactions and services. No intermediary; direct interaction with smart contracts. Transparency Limited visibility into internal operations and reserves. All transactions and smart contract code are publicly verifiable on the blockchain. KYC/AML Typically required for account creation and higher limits. Generally not required, preserving user privacy. Risk Profile Centralization risk (hacks, mismanagement), regulatory risk. Smart contract bugs, oracle failures, governance attacks, impermanent loss (for liquidity pools). Navigating the Waters: Challenges and Opportunities Surrounding a Large USDT Transfer While the recent USDT transfer highlights the growing maturity of the DeFi landscape, it’s essential to consider both the opportunities and the inherent challenges that come with such significant movements and the broader adoption of decentralized finance. Opportunities: Enhanced Financial Inclusion: DeFi protocols like Aave offer financial services to anyone with an internet connection, regardless of their geographical location or traditional banking status. This USDT transfer contributes to a system that is inherently more accessible. Higher Yield Potential: Compared to traditional banking, DeFi often presents opportunities for significantly higher returns on stablecoins through lending protocols. This attracts substantial capital from investors seeking to maximize their holdings. Innovation and Composability: DeFi is a rapidly evolving space, with new protocols and services constantly emerging. Large liquidity injections foster further innovation, allowing for complex ‘money legos’ where different protocols can be combined to create novel financial products. Transparency and Auditability: As highlighted in our table, DeFi transactions are recorded on public blockchains, offering unparalleled transparency. This allows for real-time monitoring of large USDT transfers and the overall health of protocols. Challenges: Smart Contract Risk: Despite rigorous audits, smart contracts are not immune to bugs or vulnerabilities. A flaw could lead to the loss of deposited funds. This is a primary concern for any large USDT transfer into a DeFi protocol. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for DeFi is still evolving globally. Potential future regulations could impact the accessibility or functionality of protocols, posing risks for large-scale users. Market Volatility (Indirect): While USDT is a stablecoin, the broader crypto market’s volatility can indirectly affect DeFi protocols. For instance, if collateralized loans become undercollateralized due to sharp price drops, liquidations can occur, impacting the ecosystem. Liquidity Risks: Although this USDT transfer boosts liquidity, there can be situations where a protocol faces insufficient liquidity for large withdrawals, especially during extreme market conditions, though Aave is generally robust. What Does This USDT Transfer Mean for You? Actionable Insights For investors, traders, and crypto enthusiasts, understanding the implications of a major USDT transfer like the one from HTX to Aave offers valuable insights. Here are some actionable takeaways: Monitor Whale Movements: Large transactions often precede significant market shifts or indicate prevailing sentiment among major players. Tools like Whale Alert provide real-time data that can inform your strategies. Research DeFi Protocols Thoroughly: Before committing funds to any DeFi platform, conduct extensive due diligence. Look for audit reports, understand the protocol’s governance model, assess its TVL (Total Value Locked), and evaluate its community support. Aave, while a leader, still requires users to understand its mechanisms. Understand Risk Management: DeFi offers attractive yields but comes with unique risks. Consider diversifying your portfolio, only investing what you can afford to lose, and exploring options like DeFi insurance to mitigate smart contract risks. Stay Informed on Market Trends: The move of $200 million USDT into Aave highlights a trend towards greater DeFi adoption. Staying updated on such trends can help you identify emerging opportunities and adapt your investment strategies accordingly. The USDT transfer from HTX to Aave is more than just a large sum changing hands; it’s a testament to the growing appeal and evolving landscape of decentralized finance. It underscores the increasing confidence that significant capital holders are placing in DeFi protocols for yield generation and liquidity management. While the allure of higher returns is strong, prudent engagement requires a deep understanding of the underlying technologies and associated risks. This event serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto market and the continuous innovation within the DeFi space.

The announcement comes after the recent launch of Grok 4, which has been hailed for its numerous training capabilities. Speaking about the development, Elon Musk mentioned on a livestream that he expects Grok to discover new technologies in the second part of this year. He added that if it hadn’t done so by next year, it would come as a shock to him. He also added that he is backing Grok to discover useful technologies no later than this year. The latest development comes after global criticisms the company faced over its “companions” or AI characters that are accessible to users even in kid mode. xAI recently released an update on its chatbot Grok, which included new characters that users can interact with. One of the characters, Ani, is a sexualized blonde anime bot, while the other is known as Bad Rudi, a red panda which was programmed to insult users in a graphics or bulgar way, though the trait can be turned off. We’re going to make Baby Grok @xAI , an app dedicated to kid-friendly content — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) July 20, 2025 Elon Musk announces Baby Grok amid AI characters’ criticism According to reports, the characters are powered by Grok 4 , the latest version of the chatbot that was announced by Musk. The Tesla boss called it the world’s most powerful AI model. The launch was the first time that a major artificial intelligence company had provided users with a specialized AI companion. Most companies have shelved such plans over fears of reputational damage or risks to users. Smaller AI companies that have included the AI companion feature in their chatbots have also received varying degrees of criticism, including Character AI, which allegedly built a chatbot that encouraged a teen to die by suicide. The company called the incident a tragic one and has since updated its safety features for young users. Users are expected to interact with Grok to unlock new features of the companions. Some users mentioned that Ani shows 18+ views whenever a user suggests explicit conversations. Musk has also said that ‘customizable companions’ are in the works at the company, although he refused to share a timeline. Grok is available for users 13 and older, though parental guidance is advised for 13 to 17-year-olds to use the application. Some users said they switched their accounts to ‘kids mode’, a feature that parents can enable to make the app suitable for children, and discovered that they could still interact with Ani. The users added that ‘Bad Rudi’ was switched into a companion version that is suitable for children. The news drew criticism from some users on X. Boaz Barak, a member of technical staff at OpenAI, mentioned that the new model increases some of the worst issues we have now, noting emotional dependencies among some young users. xAI has refused to respond to the criticism, but according to the FAQ page on its website, the chatbot is not open to all ages. “For instance, if users choose certain features or choose to input suggestive or coarse language, Grok may respond with some dialogue that may involve coarse language, crude humor, sexual situations, or violence,” the website reads. The launch also comes after the company was involved in a scandal when Grok gave users antisemitic responses shortly after it was reprogrammed in early July. The chatbot started to call itself MechaHitler, referencing a video game. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Against this backdrop, it’s time to rethink allocations and pinpoint the best crypto to buy now, blending opportunity with discipline. ""Take Profits"": Crypto Expert's Warning as Whale Wallet Moves $9.6B in BTC A $9.6 billion Bitcoin transfer by an early whale and new stablecoin rules in the GENIUS Act have some market experts warning of a potential price correction. This whale activity, along with the passage of three major U.S. crypto regulation bills in the Senate, has analysts on edge. Financial expert Jacob King (CEO of WhaleWire) suggests the seller might fear the GENIUS Act's stablecoin audit requirements, calling it a potential catalyst. His take? ""That alone will burst the biggest bubble and fraud in the financial history of Bitcoin. It’s entirely propped up by fake money printed out of thin air,"" he posted Friday. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Innerdevcrypto remains long-term bullish, predicting Bitcoin could soar 10x in 5 to 10 years, potentially rivaling gold's market cap. But here’s the catch: he strongly warns against endlessly holding without taking profits. The bullshit begins again:¨nobody was bullish enough¨¨the only thing that matters now is alts¨¨crime-season¨¨if you hold bitcoin now you are an idiot¨Ignore it allThe louder the insanity becomes on this app, the more you should do your daily inner work session, keep your… — Innerdevcrypto (@Innerdevcrypto) July 18, 2025 ""Take some profits on the way up,"" he urged, advising investors to enjoy gains responsibly. Bull markets, he notes, still experience brutal swings, with Bitcoin capable of plunging 30% and altcoins 50% during normal volatility. In short, don’t just believe blindly; have an exit strategy. Use crypto wins for real-life priorities like health, family, or experiences, and avoid becoming ""bitter maxis"" who never spend. Remember, even hot assets like Solana, Sui, and NFTs (Pudgy Penguins included) remain a wild ride. On the flip side, technical signals look promising. Analyst Crypto Batman spotted the Bitcoin-to-Gold ratio breaking a major pattern and now retesting resistance as support, which is a classic setup hinting at much higher prices. Researcher Alex Wacy adds that Bitcoin’s chart mirrors gold’s explosive 1979 breakout ""uncannily,"" suggesting history might repeat with a parabolic surge. Best Crypto To Buy Now With whales moving mountains of Bitcoin and regulators tightening the screws on stablecoins, investors face a crossroads between conviction and caution. These developments highlight the growing demand for strategic plays that balance momentum with risk, making this a moment to watch for the best crypto to buy now. Token 6900 Amid a $9.6 billion whale sell-off, Token6900’s $5 million capped presale offers a high-risk, high-reward option. It has a supply of 930 million, with dev tokens locked for five years. TOKEN6900 ($T6900) has surged past $630,000 in funding, just two weeks after launching on June 30. This milestone has caught traders’ attention, marking a bold step for a meme coin with no tech, no roadmap, and no apologies. It's a full-throttle internet joke turned token. Like its predecessor SPX6900, which exploded by 69 million percent over two years, TOKEN6900 thrives on raw meme culture and pure market chaos. The project openly calls itself “collective meme-fueled delusion,” embracing its role as a parody of utility-driven crypto launches. No whitepaper, no team hype, just vibes. Built on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token, TOKEN6900 mirrors the same setup that made SPX6900 a cult favorite. It’s unapologetically designed for meme believers only. A full 80% of its supply is going to the public, with zero private deals or VC allocations. It’s a free-for-all, first come, first served. Each presale tier lasts only a few days, with prices rising between stages. Early buyers lock in the lowest entry points, creating a FOMO-fueled climb. One standout feature: staking rewards are already live. Early buyers can earn up to 107% annually through the token’s “Brain Rot Vault.” Crypto YouTuber 99Bitcoins says Token 6900 could bring in some serious gains. With meme coins rallying and Bitcoin hitting record highs, T6900’s presale is pulling in heavy attention from risk-hungry crypto traders. Bitcoin Hyper In a market shaken by a $9.6 billion whale sell-off and stricter stablecoin audits, Bitcoin Hyper’s presale introduces the first fast Bitcoin Layer 2, powered by Solana VM rollups, ZK proofs, and on-chain DeFi staking. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has raised over $3.2 million in its ongoing presale, gaining strong momentum just one month after launch. The project is drawing early investor attention fast. $HYPER is priced at $0.012325 during the current presale phase, offering an entry point ahead of the next price hike scheduled within the next 24 hours. Backers are staking in big numbers. Over 192 million $HYPER tokens are already locked, with current rewards offering an estimated APY of 273%. What sets Bitcoin Hyper apart is its mission: bringing Solana-level performance to the Bitcoin network with the first SVM-powered Layer 2 chain. This leap in speed, scalability, and smart contract support positions Bitcoin Hyper as a serious infrastructure upgrade to the world’s most trusted crypto network. The fixed entry price and staking rewards are attracting investors looking for both growth and yield before the token goes live on public exchanges. As more presale phases pass and the price climbs, early adopters are hoping to ride the upside while the project builds traction in the Layer 2 space. With real utility and growing visibility, Bitcoin Hyper is being labeled by some as the next breakout coin to watch this year. Snorter As major wallets shift positions, Snorter gives traders an edge with fast layer-2 swaps, helping them move quickly and profit from short-term volatility. Snorter is rolling out a Telegram-integrated trading bot that lets users buy and sell crypto quickly, aiming to simplify the process for active Solana traders. Its key draw is cost. Standard fees sit at 1.5%, but holders of SNORT tokens pay just 0.85%, undercutting rivals like Bonk Bot and Banana Gun. The bot is built for speed and precision. Users can preload token addresses or Raydium pool IDs, and the bot auto-executes trades once liquidity appears. Snorter also handles token tax settings on the fly, removing the need for users to manually adjust for slippage or surprise transaction fees. Security features are integrated from the start. A rules engine scans for blacklist, freeze, and mint functions before each trade, flagging risky contracts with 85% accuracy in beta. The team plans to introduce a DAO, giving SNORT holders a voice in future development and upgrades. Governance voting will be tied directly to token ownership. Snorter blends real functionality with meme coin energy, offering a unique take in a sector still dominated by hype over utility. As Solana meme coins continue trending, Snorter’s mix of low fees, smart tools, and strong community appeal is pushing it into the spotlight. Conclusion The recent $9.6 billion whale transfer and looming GENIUS Act audits show that crypto markets can shift direction as quickly as an on-chain transaction. These major moves, paired with tighter regulation, reflect a maturing space where profit strategies matter as much as strong conviction. By combining assets like Token 6900’s high-risk presale, Snorter’s fast execution tools, and Bitcoin Hyper’s yield features, investors can manage volatility with both confidence and control. In this environment, knowing where to look matters, and one of the options mentioned in this article could be the best crypto to buy now.

Key Takeaways: The UK government is planning to sell over £5 billion in seized Bitcoin to help ease fiscal pressures. A centralized framework is being developed to manage storage and sales, with the Treasury closely monitoring potential proceeds. Experts warn against a hasty sell-off, drawing parallels to the UK’s poorly timed gold sale in 1999. Working alongside police forces, the Home Office is designing a centralized framework to store and sell confiscated digital assets, according to a report from The Telegraph . The plan, dubbed the “crypto storage and realisation framework,” could enable the sale of more than £5 billion ($6.5 billion) in Bitcoin, most of it recovered from historic criminal investigations. A single 2018 raid alone netted 61,000 BTC, now valued at over £5.4 billion, after prices hit $123,000 last week. Treasury Monitors Crypto Seizures as Law Enforcement Leads Sales While law enforcement handles the seizures and sales, the Treasury is reportedly keeping a close eye on the operation. Any proceeds not returned to fraud victims are typically split between the central government and law enforcement programs. Experts believe the Treasury could receive billions from the sales, providing a rare financial boost as Reeves faces the dual challenge of rising debt costs and weak economic growth. “There is oil under our feet in terms of digital assets,” said Aidan Larkin, CEO of seizure specialist Asset Reality. “I do think digital assets will lead to a large windfall for government agencies and the public purse over the next five to ten years.” The Home Office had previously invited bids for the contract to manage the crypto sale system , with terms suggesting up to £40 million in commissions for the chosen provider. While initial bids failed to meet requirements, the project is expected to continue in a revised form. The 2018 seizure of Bitcoin tied to Chinese fraudster Jian Wen is now under review, with victims requesting restitution. If the Treasury were to keep half of that haul, approximately £2.6 billion, it would go a long way toward easing fiscal pressures. Former Chancellor Norman Lamont urged Reeves to “spend it right away,” but others warn against rushing. UK’s Bitcoin Sell-Off Sparks Fears of “Another Gold Blunder” Comparisons have already been drawn to Gordon Brown’s infamous 1999 gold sale, when the UK sold 401 tonnes of gold at rock-bottom prices, a decision that cost the country tens of billions. ""History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes…"" The UK Labour Party's @Keir_Starmer @RachelReevesMP are planning to sell $5b worth of seized bitcoin If you proceed, you'll go down in history as a worse laughing stock than when @GordonBrown sold our gold at the bottom pic.twitter.com/kBR8rppHx5 — Liam | Defi-Ant Degen (@defi_ant_degen) July 19, 2025 Meanwhile, political voices have weighed in. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has called for the UK to establish a Bitcoin reserve, mirroring a move announced by Donald Trump in the U.S. Labour, however, rejected the idea, citing Bitcoin’s volatility. Despite the risks, the size of the potential windfall makes it difficult to ignore. “With the delays in court hearings that we’re getting now, you have to seize it and then maintain it for a long time,” said Cardiff University professor Michael Levi, an expert in criminal asset seizures.

In a Sunday X post, he commented, “At times, AI existential dread is overwhelming.” His remark comes just days after he announced that Tesla shareholders would soon vote on a potential investment in AI startup, xAI. At the time, he made it clear that the choice to invest in xAI wasn’t solely his to make, but on the shareholders, though he did not specify when the vote would take place. Musk has consistently voiced his concerns and forecast on AI over the years In an interview at Saudi Arabia’s Future Investment Initiative in October last year, Musk claimed that there might be a 10% to 20% chance that AI technology could go wrong. Still, he remained optimistic about its overall potential. He also predicted that AI would improve tenfold and match human capabilities within a year or two, arguing that AI technology should not take long to do everything humans can. In 2023, he argued similarly, saying that AI might eventually render everyone jobless, describing it as the “most disruptive force in history.” Speaking at an event at the UK’s Lancaster House, he said that though people could continue working if they wanted, artificial intelligence would be capable of doing every job. And besides, he added, the technology could eventually overtake the smartest human. He even alluded to a magical genie to give shape to his vision of what artificial intelligence would look like. Before this, Musk had consistently reiterated his concerns on the technology, warning that it could be more dangerous than nuclear weapons. In a widely publicized open letter, he and other prominent figures even asked to suspend all AI development beyond OpenAI’s GPT-4 . However, some tech leaders, including Palantir’s lead, Alex Karp, opposed their proposal. He claimed Musk and the others only said that because they had no notable AI offerings. In a gathering at Bletchley Park, England, political leaders cautioned against AI’s existential threats earlier that year, warning of a hypothetical superintelligence and its doomsday implications. Grok angered users with a series of anti-Semitic, controversial posts Recently, Musk’s xAI ran into trouble with its Grok chatbot . The chatbot posted racist, anti-Semitic, and controversial comments. In one post, the bot called itself “MechaHitler” and even expressed support for various controversial theories in others. xAI has apologized for the bot’s outrageous posts and deleted them. Musk even said they were taking corrective action, explaining that Grok had been overly compliant with user inputs and thus susceptible to manipulation. Despite the controversy, the company still secured a $200 million deal with the US. Department of Defense alongside major AI firms like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. The company also released Grok 4, the latest model of its chatbot, which Musk hailed as the most intelligent AI to date. He claimed the system could consistently achieve perfect SAT scores and surpass the performance of most graduate students in multiple disciplines. Once again, he acknowledged that the rapid pace of AI development is somewhat frightening, though impressive, adding that they will incorporate Grok into their electric vehicles. Earlier this year, in May, Grok had also come under fire for its responses on “white genocide.” The bot answered unrelated prompts, like questions on baseball and enterprise software, with mentions of white genocide in South Africa. The issue was, however, quickly resolved, in a few hours, and the responses tied to white genocide were deleted. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Investors looking to enter at the lowest possible price have only moments left to take advantage of this final discounted phase. Once Phase 6 begins, the cost of getting in will rise, and those who hesitated may end up watching from the sidelines. What’s causing this rush is not just fear of missing out—it’s the growing recognition that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building something fundamentally different in the DeFi space. With a strong use case, high-yield models, and community-focused mechanics, this project is gaining serious traction for all the right reasons. Stable Value, Real Yield, and Flexible DeFi Mechanics At the core of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a stablecoin that stands apart from the rest. Designed to remain pegged at $1, this coin is minted only when users borrow against collateral and burned when loans are repaid. This mechanism ensures that the supply never bloats without backing, delivering real stability without relying on centralized reserves or unsustainable algorithms. Built on a Layer-2 network, this system is fully governed by smart contracts, enhancing transparency and reducing gas costs. The platform also introduces two distinct lending models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C setup, users lend assets like BNB directly into protocol-managed smart contracts. A user lending 200 BNB at 60% loan-to-value (LTV) enjoys an 8% annual interest rate, resulting in a passive income of 16 BNB per year—all without active management. Meanwhile, in P2P lending, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gives borrowers access to stablecoins by using even volatile assets as collateral. For example, someone holding the TRUMP memecoin can use it to secure a stablecoin loan, even if traditional lenders might turn away such assets. With negotiated interest rates and repayment terms, this model allows borrowers and lenders to connect directly, cutting out middlemen and maximizing flexibility. Presale momentum is surging with over $12.6 million already raised in Phase 5. From a total supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens, a large portion has already been distributed among 13,600+ holders, signaling strong belief in the project’s long-term value. And with the price about to increase, the urgency to get in before the next jump is reaching its peak. mtTokens and Layer-2 Efficiency Add Passive Rewards What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) especially attractive to yield seekers is the integration of mtTokens—interest-bearing assets issued to lenders. When someone lends crypto through the platform, they automatically receive mtTokens, which represent their original deposit and accrue interest directly inside designated smart contracts. There’s no need to claim manually, no staking interfaces to interact with—just seamless, automated yield farming. The use of Layer-2 infrastructure plays a key role in this experience, providing faster transaction speeds, lower gas fees, and improved scalability. For users seeking a hassle-free way to earn consistent DeFi rewards, this setup removes many of the obstacles that typically come with more complex protocols. The roadmap for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) outlines a clear progression from presale through beta launch and full deployment, with every step backed by a firm commitment to compliance and security. The project has already undergone an independent CertiK audit, which returned strong results: a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 77.5. These figures are supported by both manual code review and automated vulnerability testing. To further enhance trust, the project has launched a $50,000 bug bounty, inviting white-hat developers to test the limits of the system. And for its growing community, a $100,000 giveaway is currently underway, distributing $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each to ten loyal participants. One investor who entered during Phase 1 at $0.01, after reallocating part of their ETH and ADA holdings, is now sitting on a 3x paper gain with the price currently at $0.03 (Phase 5). With the final listing price set at $0.06 (Phase 11), that same position is on track to deliver a 6x return even before the token hits public markets. But it doesn’t stop there—market analysts are forecasting post-listing targets of up to $0.80, which would multiply the original investment by 80x. As supply continues to shrink with each presale stage and price steadily climbs, sidelined observers are faced with a clear decision: enter now or risk missing DeFi’s most explosive opportunity of 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just another name in crypto—it’s quickly becoming the project everyone wishes they had caught early. The next phase is minutes away, and once the price moves to $0.035, this final entry window will officially close.

His post captions a comprehensive chart and a Fibonacci-based projection table that provide a closer look at possible future scenarios for XRP within the broader crypto market. The chart highlights a bullish pennant formation that has already broken out. This pattern is often regarded as a strong indicator of upward momentum. According to EGRAG CRYPTO, the measured move from this breakout projects an increase in XRP Dominance ranging from 21% up to 275%, setting the stage for what he refers to as a “Kaboom” phase. #XRP Dominance – The VOID – MEGA #BULLISH WAVE : Not everyone is paying attention to #XRP Dominance, but I truly believe it’s signaling a MEGA #BULLISH WAVE!

This void suggests low historical resistance in that range, meaning that if XRP Dominance manages to close above 5.75%, it could accelerate toward higher Fibonacci levels. While XRP Dominance has shown notable strength , EGRAG CRYPTO has set high targets. The accompanying table further illustrates potential market cap scenarios based on Fibonacci retracement levels. At Fib 0.5, XRP could represent 5.75% dominance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 If the crypto market reaches a market cap of $10 trillion, which is EGRAG CRYPTO’s highest projection, XRP would have a market cap of $575 billion, implying a price of approximately $9.71. At Fib 0.618, XRP’s dominance will increase to 8%, equating to a market cap of $800 billion and a price of around $13.52. Moving higher, Fib 0.702 reflects 11.44% dominance and a market cap of $1.44 trillion, placing XRP at $24.33. At Fib 0.786, dominance reaches 15.22%, resulting in a market cap of $1.522 trillion and a price of about $25.71. Finally, at Fib 0.888, XRP’s dominance peaks at 21.54%, corresponding to a market cap of $2.154 trillion and a price near $36.39. The analyst has previously set a dominance target of 27% , and these targets could be a precursor to the final 27% target. The Path Toward the Kaboom Phase EGRAG CRYPTO’s post emphasizes that surpassing the 5.75% threshold is critical for triggering what he describes as the Kaboom phase. This phase is expected to unlock a “Mega Bullish Wave” for XRP Dominance, supported by technical patterns and the current market structure. He asserts that the community may not yet be “bullish enough” for the potential scale of this move. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

On-chain data shows that the hacker responsible for looting over $300 million from Coinbase users has gone long on Ethereum (ETH). The wallet reportedly linked to the hacker scooped 649.62 ETH (approx. worth $2.31 million) at an average price of $3,561. This move follows a month-long laundering campaign and signals that the attacker is now taking a directional bet on Ethereum’s upside. Ether price has jumped by 26% over the last 7 days. Ethereum hits $3,700 as whales flood in Data shared by Lookonchain shows that the same Coinbase hacker wallet has added 4,863 Ethereum (approx. worth $12.55 million) on July 7 at the average price of 2,581. However, two months ago, the exploiter sold 26,762 ETH (approx. worth $69.25 million) when it was trading around $2,588. This isn’t the only big money moving into ETH, as two newly created institutional-grade wallets purchased a combined 58,268 ETH, worth an estimated $212 million. The accumulation was done via FalconX and Galaxy Digital. The hacker who stole $300M+ from #Coinbase users bought another 649.62 $ETH ($2.31M) at $3,561 9 hours ago. https://t.co/u0exg3Oaao https://t.co/2bLvhTVVhu pic.twitter.com/wyjCXPbQMe — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) July 20, 2025 On the other side, a known whale wallet (0xd5ff) closed a long ETH position a few hours ago while locking in a $1.7 million profit. Over the past four days, the same address executed six ETH long trades, all of which remained profitable for him. It holds a total profit haul nearing $3 million. The largest altcoin is riding the bullish wave very well and has posted gains of more than 125% in the last 90 days. Ethereum is trading at an average price of $3,705 at press time. Its 24-hour trading volume hovers around $30 billion. Source: SoSoBValue The institutional appetite for Ethereum is still accelerating. Ether-linked US ETFs recorded $402.5 million inflow on Friday and outpaced Bitcoin ’s $363.45 million. BlackRock’s ETHA fund alone accounted for $394.91 million of that total. Fidelity’s FETH and Grayscale’s ETHE recorded modest outflows. Ether ETF trading volumes hit $2.8 billion, while total assets under management for Ether products surged to a record $18.37 billion. Inside Coinbase’s $300M ETH heist The Coinbase hack itself remains one of the most controversial incidents in 2025. As first reported by on-chain investigator ZachXBT, the attacker initially swapped $42.5 million worth of stolen Bitcoin for Ethereum via Thorchain. They later converted nearly 18,000 ETH into over $45 million in DAI stablecoins, further obfuscating the trail. The breach reportedly stemmed from a social engineering scheme. Hackers bribed external contractors and support employees located outside the United States to gain access to sensitive user data, impacting 97,000 Coinbase accounts. Login credentials weren’t compromised, but names, addresses, and emails were exposed. Coinbase has pledged to reimburse affected users and estimate damages. However, the company reportedly refused to meet the attacker’s $20 million ransom demand. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The interview aired just days after the highly anticipated Circle IPO, which McPhie noted has signaled a “very bullish market for crypto-related stocks.” “We were lucky to get to the market even before the Circle IPO,” said McPhie. “With our merger with BSGM, we’ve brought Streamex to the Nasdaq, allowing us to deliver a truly innovative public vehicle for commodities tokenization.” The newly merged entity aims to bring real-world commodities on-chain through financial products tailored specifically to the unique dynamics of the sector. According to McPhie, the company’s mission centers on the democratization of capital and efficiency of assets — two core principles enabled by blockchain tokenization. “With tokenization, we can create financial instruments that don’t exist today in the commodity space,” he added. “It’s about unlocking value, liquidity, and access.” Backing this mission are key industry veterans now serving as advisors, including: Shaun Rosen, founder of what was once North America’s largest mining operation (Osoco Mining) Frank Giustra, a serial entrepreneur who has built multiple companies exceeding $50 billion in combined valuation Streamex is fully regulated in Canada and is actively pursuing U.S. broker-dealer registration to further solidify its presence in North America’s financial markets. “As a first mover in this space, we're paving the path for commodity tokenization to go mainstream — bringing novel, efficient assets to public investors,” said McPhie. About Streamex Streamex is building the future of real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, with a focus on commodities and hard assets. The company’s mission is to create financial instruments that bring efficiency, liquidity, and broader access to global markets through blockchain-based innovation.

Meanwhile, Hedera’s HBAR rally points to explosive altcoin season, with several tokens flirting with 50x upside. Here’s why a short-term pullback may clear the path for new highs, and which DeFi utility project deserves a spot on every best crypto presale 2025 list. BTC Bears Filling Gaps Before Bull Resumes A classic V‑shaped reversal after Bitcoin’s all‑time high near $123,000 signals profit‑taking and bearish control. Two Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) on the 4‑hour chart, first at $119,000 and the next around $111,000, are magnets for price reversion. A CME gap near $114,000–$116,000 adds credence to an imminent retracement toward that zone before bulls reclaim their footing. Yet on-chain metrics remain supportive: daily volumes have averaged over $100 billion, and the Fear & Greed Index sits firmly in “Greed,” not yet extreme. Should BTC fill these gaps, the next bitcoin price prediction targets of $170,000 and even $200,000 become plausible as leverage unwinds and fresh buyers step in. Source: Tradingview HBAR’s Parabolic Charge and Short‑Term Warning HBAR has posted a fourth consecutive bullish weekly candle after bouncing at $0.125 support, surging toward the $0.300–$0.340 resistance cluster. Weekly RSI above 50 and a positive MACD echo October 2023 readings that preceded a multi‑month boom, underpinning a bullish Hedera outlook for 2025. Shorter‑term, however, the six‑hour chart shows HBAR hitting a Fibonacci extension at 1.61× wave one, accompanied by bearish divergences in RSI and MACD. A pullback to $0.240 would offer a healthier base for the next leg higher, potentially positioning HBAR for 50× gains against select low cap crypto gems once macro tailwinds return.

For those immersed in the volatile cryptocurrency landscape, the principles of market analysis and anticipating shifts are second nature. This same vigilance applies to the traditional foreign exchange (forex) market, a behemoth that dwarfs all other financial markets combined. When a titan like Goldman Sachs issues its near-term Goldman Sachs forex outlook , the financial world takes notice. Their pronouncements offer a crucial lens through which to view potential shifts in global currencies, impacting everything from international trade to investment strategies. Let’s delve into what this influential forecast means for the global financial ecosystem and how it might guide your understanding of impending currency movements. Goldman Sachs’ Pivotal Forex Outlook: What’s the Big Picture? Goldman Sachs, a global leader in investment banking and financial services, consistently provides in-depth analysis across various asset classes. Their Goldman Sachs forex outlook is particularly significant because it reflects the collective intelligence of their vast research teams, proprietary models, and deep institutional connections. This isn’t just a speculative guess; it’s a meticulously crafted perspective based on extensive data and economic indicators. For market participants, from institutional investors to individual traders, this outlook serves as a vital benchmark, often influencing sentiment and positioning in the short to medium term. Typically, Goldman Sachs’ outlook provides a comprehensive overview, addressing: Key Themes: What are the overarching narratives driving currency markets? (e.g., inflation trends, central bank divergence, geopolitical stability). Specific Pair Forecasts: Detailed predictions for major currency pairs like EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, and commodity-linked currencies. Risk Factors: Potential events or developments that could derail their primary forecast. Strategic Recommendations: Actionable insights for positioning in the forex market. Their latest outlook often emphasizes a cautious yet opportunistic stance, navigating a landscape marked by persistent inflation, varying central bank responses, and evolving geopolitical tensions. Understanding their foundational perspective is the first step in decoding the complex world of currency trading. Decoding the Latest Forex Market Analysis: Key Insights from Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs’ rigorous forex market analysis incorporates a blend of macroeconomic fundamentals, technical indicators, and quantitative models. Their approach often highlights several critical factors that are currently shaping currency valuations. One primary focus often revolves around the interest rate differentials between major economies. As central banks globally adopt different paces in monetary policy tightening or easing, the carry trade becomes a significant driver, favoring currencies of economies with higher interest rates or those expected to raise rates further. Other key aspects of their analysis typically include: Inflation Trajectories: How persistent is inflation in major economies, and how will it influence central bank decisions? Goldman Sachs often provides granular details on core versus headline inflation and its implications for purchasing power parity. Economic Growth Differentials: Stronger economic growth in one region relative to another can attract capital flows, strengthening the local currency. Their analysis often compares GDP forecasts and labor market data across G10 economies. Commodity Price Movements: For commodity-exporting nations (e.g., Australia, Canada), commodity price fluctuations directly impact their terms of trade and, consequently, their currency strength. Goldman Sachs’ commodity research feeds directly into their forex views. Geopolitical Risk Premium: Global events, from conflicts to trade disputes, can induce safe-haven flows, typically benefiting currencies like the US Dollar, Japanese Yen, or Swiss Franc during times of uncertainty. Their analysis quantifies this risk where possible. For instance, if their forex market analysis suggests a divergence in economic performance between the Eurozone and the United States, with the latter showing more resilience, it naturally leads to specific predictions for the EUR/USD pair. What Are Goldman Sachs’ Crucial Currency Predictions for the Near Term? While specific predictions can vary with each new report, Goldman Sachs’ recent currency predictions often focus on the interplay between major central bank policies and underlying economic resilience. Here’s a hypothetical example of the types of predictions they might issue, based on common market themes: Currency Pair Goldman Sachs’ Near-Term Outlook Key Rationale EUR/USD Neutral to Slightly Bearish Persistent Eurozone growth concerns, potential for ECB to ease before Fed. GBP/USD Slightly Bullish UK inflation stickiness prolonging BoE tightening, improving growth outlook. USD/JPY Bullish USD Widening interest rate differentials, BoJ’s cautious stance on policy normalization. AUD/USD Neutral China’s economic recovery vs. domestic inflation pressures and commodity price volatility. These currency predictions are not static; they are constantly re-evaluated based on incoming data and shifts in the global landscape. Goldman Sachs often provides target ranges for these pairs, offering investors a quantitative guide for their positioning. It’s important to remember that these are forecasts, not guarantees, and market volatility can lead to deviations from predicted paths. How Do Global Economic Trends Shape Forex Fortunes? The forex market is a direct reflection of macroeconomic forces. Goldman Sachs’ expertise lies in connecting the dots between overarching global economic trends and their precise impact on currency valuations. Consider the following: Central Bank Policies: The most dominant driver. Divergence in interest rate policies (e.g., Federal Reserve vs. European Central Bank) directly influences capital flows. Higher rates attract foreign investment seeking better returns, strengthening the local currency. Inflation and Deflation: Persistent inflation erodes purchasing power, potentially weakening a currency over the long term, unless the central bank aggressively raises rates to combat it. Deflationary pressures can also be detrimental, signaling weak demand. Trade Balances and Capital Flows: A country with a persistent trade surplus (exports > imports) typically sees its currency strengthen as more foreign currency is converted into the local currency to pay for goods. Strong foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows also boost demand for the local currency. Fiscal Health: Government debt levels and fiscal deficits can impact investor confidence. Concerns about a country’s ability to service its debt can lead to capital flight and currency depreciation. Geopolitical Stability: Periods of heightened geopolitical tension often lead to a flight to safety, with investors moving capital into perceived safe-haven currencies, regardless of economic fundamentals. Goldman Sachs’ reports often dissect these trends, providing a holistic view that goes beyond simple rate differentials, offering a nuanced understanding of how interconnected these factors are in shaping global economic trends and their ripple effects on forex. The USD Forecast: A Deep Dive into the Dollar’s Future The US Dollar (USD) holds a unique position as the world’s primary reserve currency and the dominant currency for international trade and finance. Consequently, the USD forecast from Goldman Sachs carries immense weight. Their analysis typically hinges on several critical pillars: Federal Reserve Policy: The Fed’s stance on interest rates, quantitative easing/tightening, and its forward guidance are arguably the most significant determinants of the dollar’s strength. A hawkish Fed (signaling higher rates) generally supports the dollar, while a dovish stance can weaken it. US Economic Performance: Robust US economic growth, strong employment figures, and resilient consumer spending can attract capital inflows, bolstering the dollar. Conversely, signs of recession or significant slowdowns can put downward pressure on the currency. Safe-Haven Demand: During periods of global uncertainty, financial market turmoil, or geopolitical crises, the USD often benefits from its safe-haven status. Investors flock to US Treasuries and dollar-denominated assets, driving up its value. Relative Valuations: The dollar’s strength is also assessed relative to other major currencies. If other central banks are perceived to be easing more aggressively or their economies are underperforming, the dollar can strengthen by default. Goldman Sachs’ recent USD forecast might suggest a period of consolidation for the dollar, potentially with a slight bias towards depreciation against certain currencies if the Fed is expected to pivot towards easing sooner than other major central banks, or if global growth outside the US picks up significantly. However, its safe-haven appeal ensures that any sudden market shocks could quickly reverse such trends, reinforcing the dollar’s enduring strength in times of crisis. Actionable Insights and Navigating the Volatile Forex Landscape So, how can investors and traders leverage Goldman Sachs’ forex outlook ? While their reports are primarily aimed at institutional clients, the insights are invaluable for anyone seeking to understand market dynamics. Here are some actionable takeaways: Identify Key Themes: Understand the overarching narratives (e.g., inflation, interest rate divergence, growth outlooks) that Goldman Sachs believes will drive currency movements. Validate Your Own Analysis: Use their predictions as a reference point. Does your own research align with theirs? Discrepancies can highlight areas for deeper investigation or potential opportunities if you believe the market is mispricing something. Risk Management: Be aware of the risks highlighted in their outlook. Geopolitical events, unexpected inflation data, or shifts in central bank rhetoric can quickly invalidate even the most robust predictions. Always employ sound risk management strategies, such as stop-loss orders and appropriate position sizing. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Goldman Sachs’ near-term outlook provides a tactical view. For longer-term investors, these insights can inform strategic asset allocation decisions, especially for those with international exposure. Stay Updated: Financial markets are fluid. The ‘near-term’ can change rapidly. Continuously monitor economic data releases, central bank communications, and geopolitical developments that could alter the fundamental assumptions behind any forecast. The challenges in the forex market are inherent to its nature: high volatility, rapid information dissemination, and the constant interplay of countless global factors. Even the most sophisticated models can be caught off guard by ‘black swan’ events or sudden policy shifts. Therefore, while Goldman Sachs provides a powerful compass, independent critical thinking and adaptive strategies remain essential. Conclusion: Embracing the Crucial Insights for Future Success Goldman Sachs’ near-term forex outlook offers a compelling glimpse into the minds of some of the world’s most astute financial analysts. By dissecting their forex market analysis , understanding their currency predictions , and recognizing the profound influence of global economic trends and the specific USD forecast , market participants gain a significant edge. In a world where financial markets are increasingly interconnected, these insights transcend traditional asset classes, offering valuable context even for cryptocurrency investors who understand the power of macro forces. While no forecast is infallible, leveraging such expert perspectives provides a robust framework for navigating the complex and ever-evolving currency landscape. Staying informed, adaptable, and disciplined will be crucial for anyone looking to capitalize on the powerful shifts predicted by leading financial institutions.

Analysis Company Releases Technical Analysis,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-lies-ahead-for-solana-sol-prices-analysis-company-releases-technical-analysis/,"In its latest technical assessment of Solana (SOL), cryptocurrency analysis firm MakroVision stated that the correction structure predicted in their previous analysis has come true and the price has declined further with the bearish (c) wave. The company said that Solana currently appears to be in a recovery phase, but critical resistance levels need to be overcome for this move to turn into a sustained rally. According to the analysis, the overall downward pattern in Solana remains corrective, defined by the blue (A)-(B)-(C) formation. This structure may be completed in the short term. However, whether the recovery will transform into an impulsive, strong, and sustainable upward wave will become clear in the coming days. If the recovery is merely a new corrective wave, the current uptrend may be limited. Technical analysis chart shared by MakroVision. Related News: JUST IN: UK Allegedly Plans to Sell $5 Billion Worth of Bitcoin - Is This the Reason for the Decline? MakroVision notes that the $223 level, in particular, represents a strong resistance area with high liquidity. A break above this level could be the first sign of a sustained upward trend. After $223, the next significant hurdle is $246. A break above this level could trigger a move towards the $270 region for Solana. Meanwhile, support levels to watch in the event of a potential pullback are also being carefully considered. $198 (0.5 Fibonacci) and $193 (0.618 Fibonacci) are seen as short-term support zones, while $188 is considered a strong support level. A break below this level could see Solana re-enter a downtrend and test lower levels. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What Lies Ahead for Solana (SOL) Prices?

The latest surge gained momentum through July with ETH posting a record 37% monthly gain , driven by historic institutional demand through spot ETFs that recorded single-day inflows of $720 million. ETH is currently trading well above all major moving averages, and it is approaching the critical $4,000-$4,200 resistance zone. Institutional accumulation behind Ethereum’s rally has outpaced Bitcoin’s ETF flows, with BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale funneling billions into Ethereum products. This shifting institutional preference provides fundamental support for technical breakouts, positioning ETH for potential acceleration. Technical analysis reveals that Ethereum is approaching a historic inflection point, where cycle patterns suggest that the most explosive phase may still lie ahead. Ascending Channel Targets $4,100 Breakout Ethereum’s 4-hour chart reveals methodical progression through a well-defined ascending channel, building momentum since March lows. ETH is currently testing the upper boundary around $3,700-$3,800, and trades well above all exponential moving averages in bullish alignment. Source: TradingView The positioning indicates strong underlying momentum with pullbacks likely finding support at progressively higher levels. RSI readings of 78.54 indicate strong momentum approaching overbought conditions, but institutional ETF flows provide fundamental support for sustained advances. The projection above $4,100 is based on measured moves from a channel breakout, combined with resistance levels aligning with previous cycle highs. ETF inflows exceeding those of Bitcoin indicate a shifting institutional preference toward Ethereum, with multiple public companies expanding their treasuries to cover ETH as well. Cycle Analysis Suggests Explosive Phase Ahead Ethereum approaches major resistance around $4,000-$4,200, which must be cleared to confirm the initiation of a new bull market cycle. A breakout above this “Strong High” resistance zone would likely trigger what analysts describe as “the most explosive part of the cycle.” Source: Crypto Caesar Market structure analysis reveals that ETH has successfully reclaimed multiple intermediate levels as it approaches the final major hurdle. Cycle comparison analysis provides an even more compelling long-term outlook. While Bitcoin is 1,949% above its macro base, approaching upper expansion zones where previous cycles saw momentum shifts toward altcoins, Ethereum, at 961%, remains significantly lower in its expansion cycle. $ETH is doing exactly what it did before every major rally. BTC is now trading 56% above its macro base. ETH is at 83%, still below its full expansion zone. This chart isn’t showing price targets. It’s showing where we are in the cycle. $BTC reached its upper expansion band,… pic.twitter.com/jqyCZmAazt — Cas Abbé (@cas_abbe) July 20, 2025 Historical patterns also suggest that Bitcoin typically consolidates at similar levels, while Ethereum enters periods of aggressive growth. Current positioning suggests that the transition point may be approaching even further, with Bitcoin showing signs of deceleration. At the same time, Ethereum builds momentum for its expansion phase, targeting cycle parity and potentially parabolic advances. BTC Hyper: Final Chance to Join $3M Presale Success As Ethereum moves towards $4,000+ levels, Bitcoin is not left behind. With BTC Hyper , Bitcoin holders can participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities. BTC Hyper’s $HYPER token presale has raised over $3.7 million, with a few hours left before the presale window closes permanently. Early investors are securing positions in the Layer-2 solution that bridges Bitcoin into Ethereum’s expanding ecosystem. The platform’s Solana Virtual Machine architecture enables Bitcoin holders to access Ethereum-based DeFi protocols and yield farming opportunities without selling BTC positions. $HYPER token holders benefit from high APY staking rewards, reduced transaction fees, and governance rights in the upcoming DAO launch, scheduled for Q3/Q4 2025, alongside the mainnet deployment. As cycle analysis suggests, Ethereum may be entering its most aggressive growth phase while Bitcoin consolidates, time is running out for investors to participate at presale pricing. The limited allocation remaining and approaching launch timeline create an opportunity for those seeking exposure to Bitcoin scaling infrastructure during Ethereum’s potential explosive altseason phase.

Recently, the financial giant Goldman Sachs has updated its USD/TRY forecast , a move that sends ripples through the market and provides essential insights for investors, businesses, and policymakers alike. Understanding these new targets is not just about numbers; it’s about grasping the underlying economic narratives and potential opportunities or risks that lie ahead. Understanding the Latest USD/TRY Forecast from Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs, known for its in-depth market analysis and influential projections, has once again stepped into the spotlight with revised predictions for the USD/TRY exchange rate. These updates are more than mere speculation; they are the culmination of rigorous economic modeling, analysis of macroeconomic indicators, and an assessment of geopolitical factors influencing Turkey’s economic trajectory. The previous outlook from many institutions, including Goldman Sachs, had anticipated a certain path for the Turkish Lira. However, evolving economic conditions, policy shifts within Turkey, and broader global financial trends necessitate a re-evaluation. The new targets reflect Goldman Sachs’ updated perspective on Turkey’s inflation path, monetary policy stance, and external balances. Here’s a snapshot of Goldman Sachs’ hypothetical new targets for the USD/TRY exchange rate, providing a clearer picture of their expectations: 3-Month Target: 35.00 USD/TRY 6-Month Target: 38.00 USD/TRY 12-Month Target: 40.00 USD/TRY These figures suggest a continued, albeit potentially slower, depreciation of the Turkish Lira against the US Dollar over the coming year. This revised USD/TRY forecast signals a nuanced view of Turkey’s economic management and its integration into the global financial system. What Drives the Turkish Lira Outlook ? Key Economic Factors The trajectory of the Turkish Lira outlook is influenced by a complex interplay of domestic and international factors. Goldman Sachs’ revised targets are likely based on a thorough examination of these elements. To truly understand the forecast, it’s crucial to delve into the core drivers: 1. Inflationary Pressures and Monetary Policy Turkey has grappled with persistently high inflation for an extended period. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has recently adopted a more conventional monetary policy, characterized by significant interest rate hikes aimed at taming inflation. Goldman Sachs’ new targets likely factor in the effectiveness and sustainability of these measures. If inflation proves stickier than anticipated, or if there’s a perceived reversal in policy commitment, the Lira could face renewed pressure. Conversely, successful disinflation could provide some stability. 2. Current Account Deficit and External Financing Turkey typically runs a current account deficit, meaning it imports more goods and services than it exports. This deficit needs to be financed by capital inflows, such as foreign direct investment or portfolio investment. The ability to attract stable and sufficient foreign capital is vital for the Lira’s stability. Any concerns about Turkey’s external financing capabilities or shifts in global risk appetite can directly impact the Turkish Lira outlook . 3. Geopolitical Landscape and Domestic Stability Turkey’s strategic geographical location places it at the crossroads of several geopolitical hotspots. Regional conflicts, international relations, and domestic political developments can all introduce uncertainty, affecting investor confidence and capital flows. A stable political environment and predictable foreign policy are conducive to a stronger Lira, whereas heightened tensions or policy unpredictability can lead to depreciation. 4. Foreign Exchange Reserves and Intervention Capacity The level of a country’s foreign exchange reserves provides a buffer against external shocks and influences the central bank’s capacity to intervene in the currency market to manage volatility. A healthy reserve position can instill confidence, while dwindling reserves might signal vulnerability and exacerbate downward pressure on the Lira. Goldman Sachs’ assessment would certainly include an evaluation of the CBRT’s current reserve position and its potential for future accumulation or depletion. The Impact of Goldman Sachs Currency Projections on Investors When a major institution like Goldman Sachs updates its Goldman Sachs currency projections, it sends a powerful signal to the global investment community. These forecasts are not just academic exercises; they have tangible implications for various market participants: For Foreign Investors: Equity Investments: A depreciating Lira can erode the USD-denominated returns of Turkish equity investments. Investors considering the Borsa Istanbul would need to factor in currency risk. Fixed Income: Turkish government bonds (TL-denominated) offer high yields, but currency depreciation can negate these returns for foreign holders. The forecast provides a basis for calculating potential real returns. Direct Investment: Companies planning direct investments in Turkey will assess the currency outlook to project future revenues, costs, and repatriation of profits in their home currency. For Domestic Businesses: Import/Export Dynamics: Businesses heavily reliant on imports will face higher costs as the Lira depreciates, potentially impacting their profitability and pricing strategies. Exporters, conversely, might find their goods more competitive in international markets. Debt Management: Turkish companies with significant foreign currency-denominated debt will see their debt burden increase in Lira terms, posing challenges for repayment. For Individuals and Tourists: Purchasing Power: For Turkish citizens, a weaker Lira means reduced purchasing power for imported goods and services, including travel abroad. Tourism: For foreign tourists, a depreciating Lira makes Turkey a more affordable destination, potentially boosting tourism revenues. The revised Goldman Sachs currency targets provide a crucial benchmark against which investors can calibrate their risk exposure and adjust their portfolios. It underscores the importance of currency hedging strategies for those with significant Lira exposure. Navigating Volatility: Insights for Emerging Market Currencies The Turkish Lira’s journey is emblematic of the challenges and opportunities inherent in emerging market currencies . These currencies are often characterized by higher volatility compared to their developed market counterparts, influenced by factors ranging from domestic policy shifts to global risk sentiment. Understanding these dynamics is key to successful investment. Common Traits of Emerging Market Currency Volatility: Sensitivity to Global Interest Rates: Higher interest rates in developed economies (like the US) can attract capital away from emerging markets, putting downward pressure on their currencies. Commodity Price Fluctuations: For commodity-exporting emerging markets, swings in global commodity prices can significantly impact their trade balances and currency values. Political Risk: Political instability, elections, or unexpected policy changes can trigger rapid currency movements. Liquidity: Emerging market currency pairs often have lower liquidity than major pairs, meaning larger price swings can occur on relatively smaller trade volumes. Strategies for Navigating Emerging Market Currencies: Diversification: Spreading investments across various emerging markets can mitigate country-specific risks. Fundamental Analysis: Deep dives into a country’s economic health (inflation, current account, debt levels) are crucial. Technical Analysis: While fundamentals drive long-term trends, technical indicators can help identify short-term entry and exit points. Hedging: Using forward contracts or options can protect against adverse currency movements. Long-Term Perspective: Emerging markets often offer higher growth potential, but this comes with short-term volatility. A long-term investment horizon can help weather these fluctuations. The Goldman Sachs update on USD/TRY serves as a reminder that investing in emerging market currencies requires diligent research, a robust risk management framework, and an agile approach to market changes. Strategic Insights for Current FX Market Trends The Goldman Sachs USD/TRY forecast is not an isolated event; it’s a piece of a larger puzzle that forms the current global FX market trends . Several overarching themes are shaping currency markets worldwide, and understanding them provides context for specific pair movements like USD/TRY. Dominant FX Market Trends: Divergent Central Bank Policies: While some central banks (like the CBRT) are tightening aggressively, others might be pausing or even contemplating cuts. These divergences create interest rate differentials that drive carry trades and capital flows. Global Inflation Dynamics: The persistence or moderation of global inflation remains a key determinant of monetary policy and, consequently, currency strength. Unexpected inflation surges or declines can quickly alter currency valuations. Geopolitical Risk Premium: Ongoing geopolitical tensions (e.g., in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, or Asia) contribute to a risk premium in certain currencies, leading to safe-haven flows (e.g., into USD, JPY, CHF) and pressure on riskier assets, including some emerging market currencies. Commodity Market Volatility: Energy and raw material prices continue to exert significant influence, especially on commodity-exporting or importing nations. Fluctuations here directly impact trade balances and currency values. US Dollar Strength/Weakness: As the world’s primary reserve currency, the US Dollar’s overall strength or weakness impacts virtually all other currency pairs. Factors like US economic data, Federal Reserve policy, and global risk sentiment heavily influence the DXY (Dollar Index). For investors, monitoring these broad FX market trends is as important as dissecting specific forecasts. The USD/TRY movement, for instance, is not just about Turkey’s domestic policies but also about the broader strength of the US Dollar against a basket of currencies, driven by factors like US inflation and Fed interest rate expectations. Actionable Insights and Looking Ahead With Goldman Sachs’ updated USD/TRY forecast , what should investors and businesses consider? The key is to translate these insights into actionable strategies: Re-evaluate Exposure: Assess current exposure to the Turkish Lira, both direct and indirect. For businesses, this means reviewing supply chains, pricing strategies, and foreign currency-denominated liabilities. Consider Hedging Strategies: For those with significant Lira receivables or payables, exploring currency hedging instruments (forward contracts, options) can mitigate the risk of adverse movements. Monitor Policy Signals: Keep a close eye on the CBRT’s monetary policy decisions, official statements, and any indications of shifts in economic policy. Unforeseen changes can quickly alter the Lira’s trajectory. Diversify Portfolios: For investors, maintaining a diversified portfolio that includes assets from various geographies and asset classes can help cushion the impact of volatility in any single currency or market. Stay Informed on Global Trends: Beyond Turkey-specific news, understanding global interest rate differentials, commodity price movements, and geopolitical developments is crucial for anticipating broader FX market trends . The updated outlook from Goldman Sachs underscores the dynamic nature of currency markets, particularly those involving emerging economies. While the forecast points to continued Lira depreciation, the pace and ultimate levels will depend on how the underlying economic and political factors evolve. Remaining agile and well-informed will be paramount for navigating the path ahead. Conclusion: Navigating the Lira’s Path Forward Goldman Sachs’ revised USD/TRY forecast offers a critical lens through which to view the immediate future of the Turkish Lira. Their updated targets, predicting continued depreciation to 35.00, 38.00, and 40.00 against the US Dollar over the next 3, 6, and 12 months respectively, reflect a careful consideration of Turkey’s inflation fight, external financing needs, and broader economic stability. This outlook is a vital piece of the puzzle for anyone with exposure to the Turkish Lira outlook , highlighting the ongoing challenges and potential opportunities in one of the most closely watched emerging market currencies . As global FX market trends continue to evolve, driven by central bank policies, geopolitical events, and commodity prices, understanding the nuances of these predictions from institutions like Goldman Sachs becomes indispensable. For investors and businesses, proactive management of currency risk, coupled with continuous monitoring of both domestic and international economic indicators, will be key to successfully navigating the Lira’s path forward.

According to reports, the man, Naipang Hou, disappeared in May after leaving his California home without his phone, and authorities believe the disappearance is linked to his family’s crypto fortune. According to local law enforcement, they believe that the disappearance is a result of the affluence of his family through digital assets . Hou was said to have left home on a Monday without his mobile phone, and days later, his silver Toyota Yaris was found abandoned near a hiking trail in Rancho Cucamonga. Authorities proceeded to declare him missing on May 4, with sheriff’s deputies now suspecting that he may have been kidnapped. California sheriffs kickstart investigations into Hou’s disappearance According to a statement by the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department on July 7, its Specialized Investigations Division had started looking into Hou’s disappearance, branding it suspicious and finding evidence of extensive fraudulent activities related to his bank accounts. The Sheriff’s Department mentioned that an unnamed suspect contacted Hou’s family with his phone to impersonate him. While law enforcement in California has yet to arrest any suspect in the case, investigators have not ruled out foul play. In response to his disappearance, Hou’s son, Wen Hou, offered a $250,000 reward for anyone with information leading to the safe return of his father. He believes that someone stole his father’s identity and drained more than $1 million from his accounts. Wen, who made his fortune in crypto, has been serving as the CIO of investment firm and hedge fund Coincident Capital since 2019. Discussing his father’s disappearance, Wen said he had no reason to disappear. “I miss him a lot,” he told local media. “He’s sort of a guide to my life,” he said in an interview with ABC. He mentioned that his father had been remodelling their home earlier this year after he discovered a massive leak. “He did not mention anything suspicious; we knew he’d been getting bids from multiple contractors,” said Wen. “He was living actually at an apartment that insurance provided, so he wasn’t always directly involved with the day-to-day repair.” Wen noted that the last time he saw his father physically was when they went on a fishing trip. We had a great time,” Wen said. “He was mentally well, and he was happy, and there was nothing off about his personality or anything like that.” Authorities have mentioned that he was likely abducted days after the fishing trip. Wen said he started growing suspicious after he texted his father to visit, and I felt like he was not the one replying. According to commentators, wealthy crypto users often make themselves targets of criminals by flaunting their wealth online, neglecting online privacy or security. They added that poor security habits, along with the misconception that crypto is fully anonymous despite traceable blockchains, also increase vulnerability. Another comment mentioned that users are unknowingly exposed as targets through data leaks, wallet activities, and their social media posts. The trend, known as “wrench attacks” in the crypto industry, has seen an increase in kidnapping , threatening, and holding people hostage to steal their money or seed phrases. Founder of blockchain forensic firm CryptoCare, Nick Harris, mentioned that there have been 22 reported cases globally in the first half of the year. Harris mentioned that police and other authorities are now deploying cybercrime units and blockchain forensic teams to trace transactions for ongoing investigations.

This development has attracted increased investments, raising questions about its potential to secure a spot among the top five cryptocurrencies. The article explores how regulatory changes might impact Cardano and identifies other coins set for growth. This market preview is provided by Outset PR , a leading performance-driven communications agency. Outset PR specializes in empowering Web3 projects to harness market momentum, translating it into tangible visibility through precise narrative development and timely execution. Cardano (ADA) Shows Strong Momentum Amidst Bullish Gains Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) has been on a strong upward trend recently, with its price moving between $0.61 and $0.82. This represents impressive weekly and monthly gains, around 31% and 30%, respectively. Analysts point to ADA's high RSI at over 75, indicating it's in the overbought zone, which suggests buying pressure. With its nearest resistance not far away at $0.90, a surge past this level could lift ADA toward the second resistance of over a dollar. This would mean a potential rise of just over 30% from current levels. However, investors are keeping an eye on the support levels to make sure the push upward is steady.

As new rules and guidelines emerge, these key cryptocurrencies are responding in unique ways. Stay tuned to discover which of these digital assets might be gearing up for significant growth. Outset PR , a data-led communications firm, offers this analysis. It brings the same strategic clarity to market insights as they do to high-performance PR campaigns. XRP Hovers Near $3 Amid Potential Breakout Source: tradingview XRP has recently shown significant upward movement, trading between $2.40 and $3.12, with a price increase of over 45% in the last month. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates it is currently overbought, reflecting strong buying interest. The price is slightly above its 100-day moving average, suggesting a positive trend. The immediate resistance level for XRP is at $3.41, with support at $1.96. A breakthrough above the $3.41 resistance could propel XRP towards $4.14, representing a potential gain of over 40% from its lower range. The sustained momentum points to a promising outlook for XRP if it successfully surpasses these key levels. Solana on the Rise: Can It Cross New Milestones? Source: tradingview Solana (SOL) has recently demonstrated significant price movement, oscillating between $149 and $170. The cryptocurrency is nearing a resistance level at $179, with a subsequent hurdle at $199. SOL appears to be on an upward trajectory, having rebounded from a challenging six-month period with gains exceeding 12% in the last week and 17% over the past month. Should this bullish trend persist, SOL is poised to test these resistance points. A successful breakthrough above $179 could drive its price close to $200, representing an approximate 18% increase from its current range. This positive momentum is fueled by strong investor enthusiasm, maintaining an optimistic outlook for SOL's future. Dogecoin Price Holds Steady; Eyes 30% Jump to Resistance Source: tradingview Dogecoin is experiencing a stable phase, hovering between 17 and 22 cents. Its recent momentum indicates a 19% rise in the past week and a 26% increase over the past month. The coin's upcoming challenge is the resistance level at 24 cents. If buyers gain traction, Dogecoin might jump to this level, marking nearly a 30% increase from current prices. The Relative Strength Index at around 66 suggests room for more buying power. For those optimistic about Dogecoin, the 29-cent mark is the next target. However, any downturn could see a retreat to the support at 14 cents, so buyers need to watch these key levels.

The SEC’s July 7 directive for issuers like VanEck and 21Shares to amend S-1 filings, including staking provisions, has fueled optimism, with Polymarket odds at 91% for approval. The REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK), launched July 2, attracted $41 million, per Bloomberg, signaling strong institutional interest. Solana (SOL)’s high-speed blockchain, processing 5,000 TPS at $0.00025 per transaction, bolsters its appeal. Analysts project SOL could reach $190-$500 by Q4 2025 if approved, with GSR forecasting $1,300 long-term. However, regulatory hurdles and a bearish MACD suggest a possible dip to $160 if $180 resistance holds. This ETF hype underscores Solana (SOL)’s growing mainstream traction. While headlines are buzzing about a potential Solana (SOL) spot ETF approval, smart investors are quietly turning their attention to a different opportunity—one that has already delivered 20% paper gains in its presale and is nearly sold out. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a rising DeFi protocol, is making a name for itself not through hype but through solid fundamentals and a fast-moving token sale that now has only 15% of its Phase 5 supply remaining. Why MUTM Is Winning the Presale Game The momentum behind Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s presale is a reflection of its growing credibility in the crypto space. At the time of writing, over $12.6 million has been raised, and 85% of Phase 5 tokens are already sold. The current price of MUTM is $0.03, but that won’t last long—the next phase will raise the price by 20% to $0.035, giving buyers a limited-time chance to lock in gains before the final rounds and public listing. With a growing base of over 13,600 holders and a rapidly expanding community on social media, including 12,000+ Twitter followers, Mutuum is establishing strong social proof ahead of its platform launch. What also sets it apart is its high-grade security focus. The platform has completed a CertiK audit, achieving a Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 77.5, giving investors more confidence in its long-term viability. Behind the scenes, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team is developing a full DeFi ecosystem powered by a Layer-2 blockchain integration. This choice ensures that users will benefit from low transaction fees and near-instant speeds—a massive improvement over the sluggish and expensive experiences many face on Layer-1 DeFi platforms. For a lending protocol, speed and cost are everything, and Mutuum is building the infrastructure to deliver both. Adding to the excitement is a $100,000 MUTM giveaway , where ten lucky participants will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, as well as a $50,000 CertiK bug bounty to ensure the platform launches with rock-solid security. mtTokens, Real Yield, and Dual Lending Models The core mechanics planned for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) revolve around seamless yield generation and the ability to borrow without selling crypto assets. This will be enabled through mtTokens, which users are expected to receive after depositing major cryptocurrencies like ETH, BTC, or SOL. Once live, these mtTokens will automatically accumulate interest while staked in smart contracts—creating a hands-free passive income stream with no manual intervention. The protocol is designed to support two distinct lending models tailored to different risk profiles. In the upcoming Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model, users will be able to deposit assets such as ADA and earn steady returns under fixed smart contract terms. For example, a user who deposits $20,000 worth of ADA at a 55% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio could earn an estimated 9% annual yield. These returns will be transparent and contract-enforced, starting automatically once mtTokens are issued. For those seeking higher upside—or holding more volatile assets—the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will introduce direct, trustless lending between users. Borrowers will be able to use memecoins like DOGE as collateral, while lenders can set their own terms based on risk tolerance. This future-ready feature aims to support flexible repayment schedules, dynamic interest rates, and overcollateralized security to minimize default risk. Additionally, Mutuum’s protocol architecture features a governance-controlled stablecoin system that brings both stability and sustainability to its ecosystem. Stablecoins pegged to $1 will be algorithmically minted whenever users borrow against collateral and automatically burned upon repayment. This mint-and-burn cycle is designed to prevent oversupply and maintain price stability, reinforcing the platform’s long-term economic resilience. A respected crypto analyst who accurately predicted Solana (SOL)’s (SOL) explosive bull run in 2021 is now watching Mutuum Finance (MUTM) closely. According to this expert, MUTM is on track for a 20x surge post-listing, with the first confirmed exchange listing price locked at $0.06. To put this in perspective: an investor who bought in during Phase 2 at $0.015 with a $10,000 investment would have received approximately 666,666.67 MUTM tokens. At the listing price of $0.06, that same allocation would already be worth $40,000—a 4x paper gain. Now, if the analyst’s projection of $1.20 by 2026 plays out, that same investor could be sitting on $800,000, which equates to an 80x return from their original $10,000. With presale momentum accelerating, time is quickly running out to join Mutuum Finance (MUTM) before the next price surge. While others chase headlines, smart investors are taking action—securing tokens in a project that combines long-term vision with real DeFi innovation.

Notably, the second-largest cryptocurrency, among many altcoins, is experiencing a strong bullish momentum as evidenced by price gains of 45.48% over the last month. Amid the present market euphoria, Dutch market analyst Gert Van Lagen has backed Ethereum’s chances for sustained price gain based on an Elliott wave analysis. Related Reading: Ethereum’s Rally Isn’t What It Seems — Here’s What’s Really Driving It Ethereum To Complete Bull Market Cycle On High Note – Analyst The Elliot wave theory is a technical framework used to predict price targets by identifying repetitive patterns in price movements driven by investor psychology. In an X post on July 18, Van Lagen explains that this price forecast framework indicates that Ethereum may be entering the final phase of its bull market cycle, with a potential price target of $10,000. According to the analyst, the ETH bi-weekly trading chart suggests the cryptocurrency is completing a textbook five-wave cycle that began in 2022, with the fifth and final wave now unfolding in the form of an expanding diagonal. For context, the Elliot wave theory identifies a single price cycle in five waves, each composed of subwaves abc. As seen in the chart above, this includes the wave I marked by an initial impulse rally, followed by a sharp corrective Wave II as seen between 2022 and 2023. Wave III is defined by explosive momentum, pushing Ethereum to new highs, before entering a lengthy Wave IV consolidation characterized by a flat correction. Finally, there is wave V, i.e., the current status of the market, which is usually a final price surge. After breaking out of the upper boundary of the Wave 3–4, Gert Lagen explains that Ethereum is about completing subwave a of wave V following its most recent price gains. Therefore, investors should expect a brief pullback to retest the breakout zone, which would complete subwave ‘b’. After that, a blow-off rally forming subwave ‘c’ is on the cards, i.e., a price move that could push Ethereum to the $10,000 mark based on a broader Elliott wave analysis on the Ethereum bull market stretching from 2019 to date.

This unexpected rise has sparked curiosity about its potential to compete with Ethereum. Investors and enthusiasts alike are keen to see if XRP can continue its upward momentum and what this could mean for the market. Find out which coins are poised for growth. Powered by Outset PR , this analysis underscores the agency's commitment to data-backed, strategic communication within the crypto industry. Outset PR empowers visionary Web3 founders to amplify their narrative, converting momentum into tangible results. XRP Hovers Near $3 Amid Potential Breakout Source: tradingview XRP is trading in a range between $3.40 and $3.62, showing strong upward movement recently. In the last month, there's been a noticeable price increase of over 45%. The RSI indicates an overbought status, suggesting strong buying interest. The current price is slightly above the 100-day moving average, pointing to a positive trend. The closest resistance level stands at $3.41, while support is at $1.96. If XRP breaks the resistance, it could see a boost towards $4.14, marking a potential gain of over 40% from its lower range. The ongoing momentum hints at a promising future for XRP if it breaches these barriers. ETH Price Surge: Ethereum on Possible Bullish Breakout Source: tradingview Ethereum has been on a rollercoaster lately. Its current price is between 2644.37 and a bit over 3167 dollars. It's been moving up impressively, seeing a monthly rise of over 36 percent. Short-term growth shows signs of a bullish trend, with the nearest hurdles at about 3364 and 3888 dollars. The price's jump above 3100 dollars suggests a strong recovery. Technical indicators reflect the coin's strength, but its relative strength index is high, which might hint at a brief pause. If current trends hold, Ethereum could potentially grow over 20 percent, making investors hopeful for further gains and reaching key resistance levels.

Recent Dogecoin price predictions show it could hit $0.35 this week, up to $1 before September. The setup backing this Dogecoin price prediction is its recent breakout above $0.21, showing renewed bull strength. However, as the Dogecoin setup shows a breakout, a $0.08 PayFi coin also shows an incoming bullish breakout. Here is a breakdown of how investors can maximize their profit this season, as the market continues heading towards a bull run. Catalysts Fueling Dogecoin Price Prediction The bullish confirmation comes with the 4H candle showing a crossover between the 50 and 200 EMA towards the uptrend. This golden cross shows a return of an intense buying pressure likely fueled by institutional demand and whale accumulation. While the Dogecoin price prediction seems a bit early, experts believe the breakout above the $0.21 could be enough to keep the price higher. Notably, the dogecoin price has struggled to break the $0.21 zone in the past, trading below it since March. However, with fundamental factors like Dogecoin ETF speculations and a rise in utility, experts believe the DOGE price might be ready for a new surge. But, with the Dogecoin price prediction pointing towards $1 before September, some factors are brought back into consideration. Technical Analysis for $1 Dogecoin Price Prediction Seeing Dogecoin’s past struggle to break significant resistance, the price prediction of $1 before September could be a hard nut to crack. To see this Dogecoin price prediction come to life, it needs an accelerated surge beyond the old ATH at $0.73 by mid-August. However, seeing how many crypto assets face a lot of stop orders at their old ATH, the buying pressure needs to cancel out these stop orders. How Remittix Continues Shining At $0.08 As Best Crypto Presale of 2025 The Remittix presale surge past $16M is raising a lot of interest lately, taking it from an underdog to the potentially next 100x coin. However, this surge in interest also comes with the discovery of Remittix use cases, which align with the growing demand for cryptocurrency. According to experts, the Remittix cross-border payment solution could be the future of crypto, which is projected to experience fast adoption. Furthermore, many investors who have been buying Remittix tokens lately have cited different features fueling growing interest in buying more. Some of the Remittix features boosting its accumulation include: Presale Surge: rising support is pushing speculation of $1 by launch Real world use: the ability to send cross-border payments using crypto delivered into bank accounts as fiat is fueling high market interest Reward and giveaways: Remittix is set to give $250,000 away in a reward program, with 10 users receiving $25,000 each.

In a post on the social media platform X, pseudonymous analyst TechDev shares with his 535,000 followers a TOTAL3 chart, which measures the entire market cap of crypto assets excluding Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ) and stablecoins. Using three-month candles, TechDev’s analysis suggests that TOTAL3 is currently breaking out of a massive ascending triangle that started forming in late 2020. “Macro altcoin expansion has triggered. Not seen since late 2020. But this one comes after a 4-year coil…the longest in history.” Source: TechDev/X The analyst believes that the altcoin market is trading in line with what’s known as a Livermore Accumulation Cylinder, a pattern identified by trader Jesse Livermore, a pioneer of day trading prominent in the early 1900s. Livermore Cylinders typically see price trade within an ascending megaphone pattern, making increasingly higher highs and higher lows before a final parabolic run well outside the upper resistance line of the range. Says TechDev, “It’s not complicated. The entire alt market is in a Livermore cylinder.” Source: TechDev/X TechDev is also keeping an eye on stablecoins. He shares a chart showing the inverse of stablecoin dominance, or as he describes it, “stablecoin deployment.” The analyst notes that as stablecoins get deployed, it boosts digital asset prices, but that stablecoin deployment has never truly entered an uptrend, only temporary consolidations. “Most still don’t get it. This is stablecoin deployment. When it rises, crypto rises. But the moves associated with prior bull runs have only been countertrend moves. This will be the first actual breakout. It has no precedent. All prior runs have objectively been test pumps.” Source: TechDev/X Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

As the Web3 sector matures and investor scrutiny increases, the gap between exposure and outcome is becoming more visible than ever. This article cuts through the noise and spotlights the best blockchain PR agencies in 2025 for crypto projects that are serious about ROI, reach, and real traction. Whether you’re gearing up for a token launch, a major exchange listing, or a funding round, these firms know how to turn narratives into numbers. What Counts as Verifiable Results in Crypto PR?

Outset PR – Best for SEO + Performance-Based Tier-1 Campaigns Outset PR has emerged as one of the most effective and data-driven crypto PR agencies, offering guaranteed media placements, custom campaign strategies, and a proprietary distribution engine designed to deliver searchable, scalable visibility.

The crypto market is heating up. SOL, XRP, and ADA are showing renewed life. Yet, investors remain cautious. Presales are once again in focus as a smarter entry point. But what’s the best AI crypto presale to buy in 2025? Many are eyeing Nexchain. Its latest airdrop campaign is catching fire. With fast-paced technology and real-world use cases, it’s gaining momentum rapidly. Another project gaining traction is WeWake Finance. It’s focused on community governance. Their pooled rewards system supports long-term holders. As blockchain evolves, early alignment with transparent platforms like these might be the winning edge. Nexchain: High-Speed Presale + Game-Changing Airdrop Nexchain is quickly positioning itself as one of the top crypto presales to invest in for 2025. In Stage 22, it has already raised $6.6 million, an impressive figure that reflects strong early confidence. Unlike many presale projects, Nexchain has completed a Certik audit , showing that its smart contracts are secure and production-ready. What makes Nexchain stand out is its airdrop model. Token holders earn 10% of the daily gas fee revenue. This is real, on-chain yield, not just locked staking rewards. It’s an incentive backed by actual usage. Technologically, Nexchain is ahead. This is the first blockchain entirely created using AI. It combines Proof-of-Stake with AI consensus to achieve 400,000 TPS. The NEX token is more than just a trading asset; it also supports governance, staking, payments, and AI-based services. Real-world applications already encompass a wide range of fields, including healthcare, the Internet of Things, banking, and content distribution. WeWake Finance has also joined in by implementing its incentive system directly on Nexchain’s testnet. This adds legitimacy and helps the ecosystem flourish. Nexchain has launched its Airdrop with a $5 million prize pool in NEX tokens. Players can earn points each week by engaging in presale tasks, joining community events, and finishing quests. Weekly prizes go as high as $10,000, and the biggest earners at the end will win up to $300,000. It’s already attracted thousands of participants. To join, connect your wallet, complete the available challenges, and track your rank. For those looking to buy presale crypto and get involved early, Nexchain offers one of the most rewarding crypto presale projects right now. For those seeking utility, performance, and future-proof architecture, Nexchain delivers on every front. WeWake Finance: Simplifying Web3 Access WeWake Finance is currently in its whitelist phase, preparing for its upcoming presale crypto round. This platform aims to simplify access to Web3 by offering gasless Layer 2 transactions, smart wallet integration, and social login. By shifting the operational burden to partners, users can interact with DeFi, NFTs, and commerce tools more easily. dApps can sponsor gas through a Paymaster API, while developers can access white-label SDKs for Web2 and Telegram. With low swap spreads and custom rollup licensing, WeWake presents a unique approach in today’s crypto presale list by focusing on both scale and simplicity. Solana (SOL): Scalable but Still Centralized Solana (SOL) is trading at $178 and can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second. It fuels a lively environment in DeFi, gaming, and NFTs. But its history of disruptions has some people worried. Block manufacturing came to a complete halt due to major network issues in 2022 and early 2024. Solana had more than a year of uptime by the middle of 2025, but people are still working to regain confidence. Decentralization is another challenge. A small number of validators process the majority of transactions, and major U.S.-based providers control a large share of the stake. This creates vulnerability to censorship and single points of failure. Solana is speedy; however, it still has problems with reliability and validator centralisation. Nexchain, on the other hand, employs a combination of Proof-of-Stake and AI to achieve consensus. It is a superior choice for long-term infrastructure, as it is more resilient and truly decentralized. For investors focused on both performance and trust, Nexchain looks more future-ready. XRP & ADA: Legacy Coins Facing Modern Challenges XRP trades at $0.71 and ADA at $0.43. Both are respected names but face real limitations. XRP’s legal win over the SEC was big news. Still, adoption hasn’t followed. Real-world usage, especially in banking, is limited. ADA remains focused on research-first development. But its slow rollout of dApps and low TVL raises concerns. Many builders stay cautious. WeWake Finance is introducing cross-chain reward systems. Its flexible model could help revive stagnant networks like ADA. Yet, Nexchain offers more. With 400,000 TPS, $0.001 gas fees, and real AI integration, it leads in performance. While XRP and ADA hold legacy status, Nexchain is built for the future, and it’s already gaining serious traction. Conclusion – 2025 Has Choices, But Only One Has Future-Proof Infrastructure Solana offers unmatched speed. XRP and ADA bring legacy credibility. But all three face limitations, from centralization to slow adoption. Nexchain, on the other hand, checks all the boxes: scalability, ultra-low fees, and strong technical vision. Its active presale and live airdrop rewards make it accessible now. With WeWake Finance building directly on its testnet, Nexchain isn’t just promising utility; it’s already delivering. For investors seeking substance over speculation, Nexchain could be the best crypto presale to buy in 2025.

We expect POL to record a minimum price of $0.16 and a maximum price of $0.25, with an average of $0.22 in July. POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction July 2025 $0.16 $0.22 $0.25 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $0.15. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year.

The products have enabled investors to have regulated exposure to the second-largest cryptocurrency without holding it. The past twelve months have been eventful for spot Ethereum ETFs – from a slow start with minimal inflows to outflows and now massive positive flows. Regardless of the state of these products, they have played a significant role in driving institutional crypto adoption since their inception. How Are Spot Ethereum ETFs Faring? As reported by CryptoPotato at the time of the launch, the nine products collectively recorded $106 million in positive flows on their first day. Over $484 million in outflows from Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust (ETHE) greatly influenced the inflows. BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF (ETHA) took the lead on the first day with $266 million inflows and is still leading currently. Bitwise’s ETHW followed suit with $204 million, while Fidelity’s FETH raked in $71 million. Funds from other asset managers, including 21Shares, Invesco, VanEck, and Franklin Templeton, recorded inflows ranging from $13 million to $7.5 million. Comparing the most recent trading day to the debut of spot Ethereum ETFs, it is clear that these funds have made significant progress . On Friday, July 18, the ETFs collectively raked in inflows surpassing $402 million. Interestingly, that figure is not the highest the market has seen. On July 16, spot Ethereum ETFs amassed over $726 million in positive flows, marking their highest ever, according to data from CoinGlass. The next day, the products recorded their second-largest daily inflow of $602 million. These funds have been on an 11-day inflow streak since July 5, amassing over $2.8 billion in flows. BlackRock remains the leader in assets under management (AUM), with a total of $7.92 billion. Following suit is ETHE, with $3.46 billion in AUM. A Tedious Journey It is worth mentioning that the journey has been tedious for spot Ethereum ETFs, especially with ether performing poorly in this cycle. After a solid first day, the following trading days were worrisome for the ETFs. Outflows abounded , and investors were not buying as much ETH as expected . As Grayscale’s Trust continued to see outflows, flows into other products could not catch up. This trend continued, with the funds collectively recording a few days of inflows, until mid-November when the ETFs began what would later become an 18-day inflow streak. Notably, the funds have broken that record with a 19-day positive flow streak that ended on June 12.

The update was shared by the project’s creative director, urging all users to refrain from interacting with the account until they recover it from the malicious actors. The issue of cryptocurrency scams has been on the rise in the past few months. Accounts trying to promote digital assets as a get-rich scheme have multiplied across several social platforms, including X, where they have been able to lure so many people. However, gamers were surprised that the Stellar Blade official account started posting a game-themed token, a development that had not been communicated to the community before. Most fans were able to see that the account had been hacked before the creative director issued a message on behalf of the project. Hello, this is Hyung-Tae Kim, Director of Stellar Blade. The official Stellar Blade account has been compromised, and unauthorized posts containing cryptocurrency airdrops and suspicious signup promotions are currently being uploaded. We kindly ask everyone to refrain from… pic.twitter.com/Fzd3fhxwa1 — Kim Hyung Tae, 김형태, キム・ヒョンテ (@jamm3rd) July 19, 2025 Stellar Blade loses X accounts to hackers Earlier this morning, the official Stellar Blade account on blogging platform X had been sharing some questionable posts. Several posts were about a stellar coin.com token, with the handle actively promoting the coin. The account encouraged the Stellar Blade community and others to click the link for a chance to claim massive amounts of money in the form of the digital asset. As if that was not a red flag enough, the account turned off the comment section for those posts. In its follow-up posts, it said it did that to protect interested users from phishing, fake replies, and scam bots. However, the typical reason comments on these kinds of posts are turned off is to prevent anyone from warning the community and the general public against clicking the links. The hackers also used Stellar Blade characters and imagery to promote airdrops for the “Stellar Blade Coin.” The posts make claims about how many tokens users have claimed so far, enticing unsuspecting users to click on the links in the posts. Most of these scams work by leading users to a replica website where they are asked to enter certain sensitive details that the hackers can use to access their accounts and steal assets or funds. Some of the posts also promised users in-game items like an exosuit and weapon upgrades with the same link to the website. In addition to the links, the account also posted some NSFW fan art. Meanwhile, that might not have tipped off users because the project had always been sharing NSFW artwork before they were hacked. In June, the brand went too far with what it shared, leaving fans stunned at how an official brand could share such content on their page. While that was not off-limits, the project isn’t in charge of sharing the links. The posts had the markings of desperation that are associated with such scams. This way, the hacker goes on a posting spree while promising users different enticing items while posting just one link. There is also the promise of large sums of money from the airdrops, another thing that users need to watch out for. Stellar Blade director Hyung-Tae Kim was on hand to give an update on the state of the account. Kim said the posts on the account were unauthorized and warned fans to remain cautious and not engage. According to the post, the team behind Stellar Blade is working behind the scenes and in active discussions to recover the account. Presently, it is hard to say if the account will be recovered and returned to the project. However, users should realize that all the promises coming from the account concerning airdrops and in-game rewards are false, and they should avoid the posts.

According to analysis by Master Ananda , this breakdown could mark a key turning point in the cryptocurrency cycle, possibly foreshadowing a crash from the six-figure price levels, he said in a TradingView post on July 20. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Notably, the bearish signal has emerged as Bitcoin ( BTC ) attempts to reclaim the $120,000 level after recently hitting a record high above $123,000. Ananda’s analysis indicates that Bitcoin dominance is breaking down from a steep ascending wedge on the weekly chart, a bearish pattern. The move is backed by a large volume candle, echoing the heavy selling pressure seen during the 2021 and 2022 peaks. At the same time, altcoins are gaining momentum, with Ethereum ( ETH ) and Litecoin ( LIT ) leading the charge, while Solana ( SOL ), Cardano ( ADA ), and XRP are poised to follow. As Bitcoin consolidates near its resistance level, altcoins are steadily rising, signaling a maturing bull market. Master Ananda also pointed out that technical indicators suggest Bitcoin dominance could fall to around 49.16%, aligning with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, a historically strong area of support. A drop to this level would indicate a significant capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins. Bitcoin next price level to watch This trend, Ananda said, sets the stage for a major market shift. Once Bitcoin completes its consolidation, it is expected to resume its upward trajectory, with targets projected between $134,000 and $136,000. However, a sudden correction, or even a sharp drop toward $100,000, remains a possibility if Bitcoin dominance continues to erode faster than expected. While Bitcoin’s volume appears to be weakening, social media activity around the asset has surged. Notably, since its climb to a new all-time high, Bitcoin has seen a dramatic spike in social media chatter, fueling concerns of a near-term pullback. According to sentiment platform Santiment , nearly 43% of all crypto-related mentions this week were focused on Bitcoin, marking its highest “social dominance” in years. Analyst Brian Quinlivan noted that this spike suggests rising retail investor FOMO, often a signal of overheated market conditions. Bitcoin social sentiment data.

Source: Finbold Technically, Bitcoin’s 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) sits at $108,727, indicating near-term strength, while the 200-day SMA at $89,326 reinforces the broader uptrend. However, the 14-day relative strength index ( RSI ) at 65.01 suggests approaching overbought territory, raising the risk of a pullback. Featured image via Shutterstock.

According to sources familiar with the matter, Bessent clearly explained to Trump the risks such a step could pose to the economy, markets and politics as Powell enters the final 10 months of his term. Bessent's key points to Trump's warnings included signals that the Fed was preparing to cut interest rates by the end of the year, the potential negative market reactions, and the political and legal challenges of impeachment. According to the sources, Bessent argued that such a move was unnecessary, noting that the economy was already in good shape and that markets were responding positively to Trump's policies. While the possibility of Powell's dismissal has been discussed for months, the issue resurfaced last week. Trump has frequently complained that the Fed needs to lower interest rates, and a senior White House official reported that the president, in a meeting with Republican lawmakers, said he was considering firing Powell. However, Trump told reporters the same day that he had no such plans. The discussions briefly rattled financial markets, with investors concerned that the politically motivated removal of central bank governors could undermine the Fed's independence and ability to control inflation. Related News: An Exchange Hack Attack Shakes the Cryptocurrency World: CEO Confirms In April, the Wall Street Journal reported that Bessent, along with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, had advised Trump against firing Powell. In recent developments, Bessent has reminded Trump that if Powell is removed, he could file a lawsuit, and that the case could be delayed until May, when Powell's term ends. Some advisers also indicate that if Powell is removed, Fed Vice Chair Philip Jefferson would serve as acting chairman, though he too is a Biden appointee and close to Powell. They also point out the difficulty of quickly confirming a new presidential nominee due to the Senate's summer recess. Bessent's other message to Trump was this: The president will have the option to make two key appointments at the beginning of 2025 that will determine the direction of the Fed. Fed Board Member Adriana Kugler's term ends in January, and Powell's in May. This gives Trump the opportunity to establish his long-term influence over the Fed now. *This is not investment advice.

Draper, a founding partner at Draper Associates, argued in a recent interview that the gradual decline of the U.S. dollar could dampen the effects of Bitcoin’s halving events—long known to trigger significant price movements in the crypto market. “Between 10-20 years from now, the dollar will be extinct,” Draper told Cointelegraph. “The world is changing, and we are watching it happen. We are right in the center of an anthropological leap forward,” he said. Bitcoin’s Role as a Safe Haven Draper pointed to growing investor interest in Bitcoin as a hedge against flawed monetary policies, rising inflation, global instability, and lack of trust in traditional financial institutions. He described Bitcoin as an “escape valve” amid these pressures, noting that its appeal continues to grow due to its fixed supply and decentralized nature. Shifting Focus from the Halving Cycle Bitcoin halvings, which reduce the number of new coins entering circulation, have historically triggered bull markets. However, Draper said that while the halving still has some influence, larger macroeconomic dynamics may now be more decisive in shaping Bitcoin’s trajectory. “The halvings may have less of an effect if Bitcoin runs against the dollar the way it has, because it will probably go for a prolonged period,” Draper said. “It will still be affected in some way by that four-year cycle, but I think the effect will dampen. I think there will be a macro driver that pushes Bitcoin along, and I think the macro driver will be a bigger deal than the halvings.” Debate Over Bitcoin’s Maturity The idea that Bitcoin is evolving into a macroeconomic asset is not universally accepted. Xapo Bank CEO Seamus Rocca recently said that the four-year cycle is still valid, suggesting that halving events remain relevant. Others believe that Bitcoin has matured past its early speculative cycles and is now more reactive to broader economic shifts. Global Conditions Favoring Bitcoin Draper’s perspective aligns with other experts who expect geopolitical and economic turbulence to benefit Bitcoin and other hard-money alternatives. In February, Bitwise analyst Jeff Park suggested that ongoing inflation, protectionism, and the weakening U.S. dollar could drive global Bitcoin adoption. Meanwhile, the U.S. government continues to push dollar-backed stablecoins to preserve the dollar’s dominance by increasing demand through blockchain integration. Skepticism of Stablecoins’ Longevity Despite this strategy, not everyone sees stablecoins as a permanent solution. Bitcoin advocate Max Keiser criticized dollar-denominated stablecoins as a temporary fix, predicting they will eventually be outpaced by gold-backed tokens and Bitcoin itself. As macroeconomic conditions change and digital currency becomes increasingly mainstream, Draper and others see the dollar’s future as uncertain—and Bitcoin’s as more integral to global finance.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-07-20 12:47:28

This follows a stretch in which the S&P 500 saw modest gains while the Nasdaq notched a fifth straight record close. Results will also emerge from companies across consumer and industrial sectors, as well as from energy and health‑care providers. Meanwhile, economists will be monitoring June’s data on new‑home starts and resale transactions for clues on the housing market’s direction. Tesla faces downgrade as Alphabet and Intel go all out on AI Tesla’s (TSLA) earnings, set for Wednesday, attract extra attention as investors parse several headwinds. Analysts have cut their ratings, pointing out that deliveries in Europe are slowing and the stock is down almost 20% so far this year. Executive departures have only compounded the uncertainty, and UBS analysts recently described Tesla shares as “fundamentally overvalued.” Meanwhile, Musk’s robotaxi rollout and his recent exchanges with Donald Trump, including hints at forming an independent political party, add extra drama to the release. Alphabet (GOOG) is also on Wednesday’s agenda, and investors will be eager for updates on its AI initiatives and their implications for long‑term growth. Intel reports after the market closes on Thursday, and analysts rate the stock a “hold,” with an average price target of about $22, close to its recent price above $23. Investors are focused on its chip‑making (foundry) division, where CEO Lip‑Bu Tan may write off assets to switch to a new process for big clients like Nvidia and Apple. UBS warns this shift could pay off but carries risks. Wall Street expects Q2 revenue of $11.93 billion (down 7% year‑over‑year) and adjusted profit of $74.5 million (2¢ per share), versus $83 million (2¢) last year, with foundry sales also forecast to fall 7% to about $3.98 billion. UBS has raised its price target to $25, while Wedbush and HSBC keep theirs at $19 and $22—all “hold.” Intel is also cutting several thousand jobs in Oregon as part of its ongoing restructuring. Verizon (VZ) reports on Monday, with analysts expecting its subscriber counts to level off. AT&T (T) follows shortly thereafter. Midweek brings reports from Coca‑Cola (KO) and General Motors (GM), which may reveal the impact of recent tariffs on exporters. To cap the week, HCA Healthcare (HCA) reports on Friday amid efforts to manage the fallout from its recent data breach. Housing market data could confirm persistent weakness High borrowing costs, steep prices and tight supply have weighed on buyers. While May saw a slight uptick in existing‑home transactions, the annualized pace of about 4 million remained near multi‑decade lows. On Wednesday, the National Association of Realtors will issue June resale figures, which market watchers will scrutinize for any signs of traction. Thursday brings the Commerce Department’s new‑home sales report, an indicator that has shown some gains as listings tick higher. Investors will also track initial jobless claims on Thursday for labor‑market insights, and Friday’s durable‑goods report for a snapshot of manufacturing activity. In Europe, macro‑watchers will turn their attention to the European Central Bank, according to CNBC , where President Christine Lagarde and her colleagues are widely expected to leave rates unchanged at 2% on Thursday. The consensus view, according to Reuters sources, is that threats from U.S. President Donald Trump over tariffs will not alter the decision this week. However, officials have signaled that if Trump proceeds with 30% duties on EU imports, the ECB could respond by cutting rates. Investors will have until September 11 to gauge the fallout, as the ECB then breaks for its summer recess. On Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and Governor Michelle Bowman will speak at a banking conference in Washington, D.C. Because their remarks fall within the blackout period before July’s Fed meeting, they likely won’t talk about policy. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman will also speak—his first appearance at a Fed event.

The recent pause in upward momentum hasn’t dampened market sentiment, which remains firmly bullish. According to Coinmarketcap’s Fear & Greed Index, Bitcoin is still currently sitting at a greed level of 68. This sentiment, combined with technical analysis of the Logarithmic Growth Curve (LGC), shows that Bitcoin is still on track for powerful upward moves. Related Reading: $57 Billion Mistake? Ex‑Ripple Engineer Reveals XRP Investment Blunder Greed Returns To The Market, But Not Yet Overheated Bitcoin’s price action has spent the majority of the past 48 hours holding above $118,000 after a wave of profit-taking took place just after it peaked at $122,838. However, on-chain data shows an interesting overview of Bitcoin investors. Particularly, crypto analyst Axel Adler Jr. shared data from CryptoQuant showing that the 30-day moving average of the Fear and Greed Index has climbed back into the optimism zone, now sitting at 66.2%. Although sentiment surrounding the leading cryptocurrency is currently in greedy territory, this level is well below the 75% to 80% range, which coincided with new price highs in March 2024 and December 2025 The current 66% reading, while in the green level, suggests there’s still room for bullish sentiment to grow before the market enters a euphoric blow-off phase. In essence, this metric shows that if Bitcoin continues to consolidate and push higher without the sentiment entering into extreme greed levels between 75% and 80%, it will continue on a sustainable push to new heights. Image From X: @AxelAdlerJr Bitcoin Re-Enters Resistance Zone On Growth Curve As mentioned earlier, Bitcoin’s break above the $120,000 price level and its subsequent peak were followed by a wave of profit-taking. The trend saw Bitcoin’s price correct to $116,000 very briefly before stabilizing around $118,000. Interestingly, technical analysis of the weekly candlestick timeframe shows that Bitcoin re-entered the first band of the Logarithmic Growth Curve (LGC) resistance zone as it reached this price peak. This band, which is identified as the light pink region in the chart below, has always served as the profit-taking area in each of Bitcoin’s past bull markets. Interestingly, Bitcoin briefly tapped this area in December 2024 and January 2025 before being rejected, in a pattern similar to that of January 2021’s first top in the previous bull cycle. Image From TradingView: TradingShot Basically, this indicator implies that Bitcoin is now at the start of a final build-up phase. According to crypto analyst TradingShot, who posted the analysis on the TradingView platform, the ultimate top for this cycle is going to be between October and November 2025. Depending on the timing and strength of factors like anticipated US rate cuts in September, Bitcoin’s peak could land anywhere between $140,000 and $200,000. Related Reading: Whales?

In 2025, names like Ethereum, Toncoin, Solana, and BlockDAG are among the most talked-about across trading platforms, social channels, and crypto forums. These coins are gaining ground for various reasons, from technology upgrades and new partnerships to growing interest from the broader market. As more buyers look toward trend-driven assets for higher returns, pinpointing which ones are gaining attention is becoming more valuable. This breakdown highlights four of the fastest-growing cryptos to buy in 2025 and examines what’s fueling their rise. 1. BlockDAG: Fast-Rising Presale & Sports Deals Drive Growth BlockDAG’s presale has quickly become a focal point in the crypto scene, with over $343 million raised and 24 billion coins purchased across 29 batches. This pace of growth reflects how quickly buyers are locking in their positions ahead of expected price increases. Participants from the first batch have already earned a 2,660% ROI, pointing to strong market traction and growing engagement. BlockDAG is setting a fast pace among new presale projects. Adding more strength to its visibility, BlockDAG (BDAG) has partnered with sports teams like the Seattle Seawolves and Seattle Orcas. The Seawolves rugby deal includes blockchain-linked content and digital collectibles during live matches. Meanwhile, the Orcas cricket collaboration, announced after their notable 238-run victory against the LA Knight Riders, introduces team NFTs and interactive fan tools. These agreements help position BlockDAG within broader sports and entertainment sectors. BDAG is currently priced at just $0.0016 and will remain at this level until August 11 through the GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With a listing target of $0.05, this presents a potential 3,025% ROI for those buying at today’s rate. 2. Solana: Supporting Meme Coins and Mass Activity Solana is maintaining its place as a major Layer-1 project, with more than 4 million daily active users. Its reputation for high-speed transactions and low fees makes it a preferred choice for projects involving DeFi, gaming, and meme coins. Recently climbing 9% to $159.41, Solana shows signs of upward momentum. However, concerns over past technical issues still affect its image, pushing some developers toward Ethereum or Base. Although Solana is often called the “Ethereum killer,” its history of network disruptions continues to raise questions about its ability to grow without setbacks. While its user numbers increase, lasting success may rely on overcoming its past reliability issues. 3. Toncoin: Gaining Speed Through Telegram and DeFi Use Toncoin’s steady rise is closely tied to its integration with the Telegram ecosystem, giving it direct access to a massive audience. With a blockchain known for being fast and cost-effective, Toncoin has made inroads into areas like DeFi, NFT platforms, and payment networks. Its recent price consistency, combined with a deflationary setup, has drawn in those focused on long-term holding. Among the fastest-growing cryptos this year, TON’s appeal lies in its ability to merge messaging and finance. Still, most of Toncoin’s connected projects remain in early stages, and its future progress may depend heavily on how Telegram continues to grow. Although it holds a strong position, the next phase of growth could require broader utility outside the current ecosystem. 4. Ethereum: DeFi Leader Holding Its Ground Ethereum remains the second-largest crypto by market cap and still leads in DeFi, NFTs, and smart contract functionality. The launch of spot ETFs has added billions in institutional capital, reinforcing Ethereum’s key role in crypto finance. As one of the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025, Ethereum benefits from wide usage and a deep developer network. That said, it faces increasing competition from faster and more affordable chains. Although the Dencun upgrade and stronger Layer-2 activity have helped reduce gas fees, the base chain continues to face cost challenges. Its value lies in trust and broad adoption, but keeping up may require more infrastructure changes ahead. Identifying the Fastest-Growing Cryptos In 2025, shifting crypto trends continue to shine a light on projects like Ethereum, Solana, and Toncoin. Their strong ecosystems and growing use cases keep them relevant in a changing market. Each has unique strengths that attract different parts of the crypto space. Yet among these fastest-growing cryptos , BlockDAG is showing exceptional speed and visibility. With a presale that’s rapidly moving through batches and strategic moves in the sports world, it offers more than just short-term hype. BlockDAG is positioning itself as a serious player in this year’s crypto growth cycle.

33767162,[object Object],1753016443,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Hits All-Time High—And The Internet Can’t Stop Talking About It,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hits-all-time-high-and-the-internet-cant-stop-talking-about-it/,"Bitcoin chatter took over social media this week as the coin climbed to a fresh high. According to Santiment, Bitcoin’s market value climbed above $123,000 for the first time in its 17-plus year history. At the same time, 43% of all crypto-related posts were about “BTC”. The surge in mentions came just as prices peaked. Then things pulled back. Bitcoin slid to about $117,125 on Monday, according to data. Social Media Frenzy Signals Pullback Based on reports from Santiment, spikes in online talk often match local tops in price. Santiment analyst Brian Quinlivan pointed out that retail traders may have been jumping in too late. He noted similar spikes on June 11 and July 7 that were followed by dips. When nearly half of all crypto posts focus on one coin, retail FOMO can push prices up briefly. But sentiment then cools, and traders get priced out. Analysts Weigh Pros And Cons CryptoQuant’s Axel Adler Jr says the market isn’t overheated yet. His “peak signal” gauge has not triggered, suggesting more room to run. On the other hand, Galaxy Digital’s Michael Harvey expects a short pause before any further gains. Harvey said that consolidation around current levels is his base case. But he also left open the chance of another move higher before the end of July. Past Warnings Were Spot On Quinlivan’s earlier cautions proved accurate. After the June 11 social spike, Bitcoin slipped. The same thing happened after a July 7 surge in optimism. Those episodes make it clear that online buzz and price tops often go hand in hand. Traders who watched those patterns could have waited for a cooldown and entered on dips. What Traders Should Watch Next Based on reports, the next key entry point may come after sentiment cools again. Watching social dominance alongside on‑chain signals could give a clearer picture. If the peak signal from CryptoQuant finally lights up, it might mean true exhaustion. Until then, Bitcoin’s ride could see more shifts up and down. Such market movements capture the dual‑edged quality of hype. On the one hand, large rallies attract new money and enthusiasm. On the other, they can be indicative of tops that result in pullbacks.

He expects the disclosure to be ready by mid-August. In a post shared on X , Hoskinson said he just received the initial copy of the audit report. After receiving the copy, he requested additional details and context in a few spots on the report. The Cardano blockchain co-founder speculated that the final copy would be released next month, assuming the work rate continues at the current pace without any sudden delays. https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1946738026488443002 Hoskinson pledges to prove allegations against IOG as untrue Previously, IOG was accused of inappropriately acquiring a significant amount of Cardano. The company acquired around $600 million in Cardano based on the allegations. Hoskinson took the step to address these accusations. He promised that a detailed audit report of his firm’s assets would become available next month and said the accusations were untrue. The accusations, he said, reflected a lack of trust within the community, and he was heartbroken. Hoskinson also addressed the claims in an X post, stating that IOG did not allocate 350 million unclaimed ADA to itself—a claim he firmly rejected. He explained that most of the ADA had already been claimed, and the remaining portion, which had gone unclaimed after seven years, was transferred to Intersect. Hoskinson stressed that no matter how often falsehoods are repeated, they cannot change the truth. An example of community members who raised the allegation includes Masato Alexander , a non-fungible token artist. According to Alexander’s allegations, Hoskinson was the mastermind of the Cardano possession. He said earlier that the IOG co-founder utilized a “genesis key” to manipulate the Cardano ledger in 2021 during the Allegra hard fork, consequently generating about $619 million worth of Cardano. Yet in the face of these allegations, Hoskinson never wavered from his claim to bring out a detailed version of the audit soon after its release. He committed to reading it from start to finish on a livestream directly after it is published and said that, in addition to a credible website hosting the report, it would be preserved in other historical forms For those spreading the allegations, Hoskinson vows to file a lawsuit against them. To demonstrate the seriousness of the situation, he said that next week he would meet up with professionals from a defamation law firm to discuss their alternatives and plans. Hoskinson stated that not receiving the benefit of the doubt shows he does not have the relationship he believed he had with certain individuals. Hoskinson intends a life pivot once all the allegations are settled In the scenario the IOG presents, a secondary market transaction called Move Instantaneous Rewards was unveiled on October 24, 2021. It accounted for the transfer of approximately 318 million Cardano. At that time, funds moved from reserve pools into treasury accounts. Following the transaction, Hoskinson stated that the acquisition of Cardano had been available for more than three years. According to his explanation, the initial buyers acquired most of the 350 million Cardano over seven years. Hoskinson plans to take a new turn when all these allegations are settled . He will probably hand over his X account to a media team and switch how he does his AMAs and X spaces. Notably, Hoskinson was one of Ethereum’s co-founders and is currently among the prominent figures in the blockchain development ecosystem.

The flagship cryptocurrency registered a sharp drop on Friday, falling to $117,877, and registered another marginal decline on Saturday. The price has stayed above $118,000, indicating strong support at this level. The current session sees BTC marginally up, trading around $118,035. Macro Drivers Could Dampen Bitcoin Halving Cycle Tim Draper, investor and founding partner of Draper Associates, believes macroeconomic drivers such as the decline of the US Dollar could dampen the impact of Bitcoin halving cycles. Halving cycles have been a major source of the flagship cryptocurrency’s volatility and bull cycles. Draper stated, “Between 10-20 years from now, the dollar will be extinct. The world is changing, and we are watching it happen. We are right in the center of an anthropological leap forward.” Draper believes investors are increasingly treating Bitcoin as an escape valve against fiat currency inflation, geopolitical tensions, poor governance, and a lack of trust in banking institutions. According to Draper, these factors are driving the global adoption of the asset. “The halvings may have less of an effect if Bitcoin runs against the dollar the way it has, because it will probably go for a prolonged period. It will still be affected in some way by that four-year cycle, but I think the effect will dampen. I think there will be a macro driver that pushes Bitcoin along, and I think the macro driver will be a bigger deal than the halvings.” Robert Kiyosaki Discusses Next Bitcoin Purchase Renowned author Robert Kiyosaki has revealed the price point at which he plans to purchase more Bitcoin and the level at which he plans to stop. Kiyosaki’s “Rich Dad Poor Dad” has become a top financial guide, having been translated into dozens of languages and helping millions. Kiyosaki stated, “Bitcoin is over $117K a coin. Going to buy one more bitcoin asap. It’s never been easier to become rich… even a millionaire. Please study, learn, and find out if Bitcoin is your path to becoming a millionaire.” BTC surged past $120,000 at the beginning of the week, on its way to a new all-time high of $123,091. However, Kiyosaki stated that he would pause further purchases. He explained the decision behind it, stating, “Bitcoin over $120K … I am buying one more coin… I will not buy any more… until I know where the economy is going. As tempting as bitcoin going to $200K to $1 million is… I do not want to be a hog and get slaughtered.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has entered a consolidation phase after surging to a new all-time high on Monday. The flagship cryptocurrency crossed $120,000 on Monday, reaching $123,091 before declining. Despite the pause in upward momentum, analysts point out that bulls remain in control, with several positive factors acting as bullish catalysts. Global crypto adoption is increasing, while the passage of key crypto bills, including the GENIUS ACT and the CLARITY Act, offers regulatory clarity to the crypto space. Crypto analyst Darkfrost stated that on-chain analysts reveal that Bitcoin’s bullish trend remains intact. According to the analyst, the current market environment offers a constructive setup, thanks to institutional interest and regulatory clarity. Bitcoin’s growth rate indicator, measured by comparing its Market Cap to its Realized Cap, continues to indicate a bullish setup. The analyst noted that Bitcoin and the crypto market are transitioning from uncertainty to clarity, thanks to a pro-crypto administration. BTC reached an intraday high of $116,393 on Thursday before settling at $116,160, ultimately registering an increase of 3.51%. Buyers retained control on Friday as the price rose 1.51% to cross $116,000 and settle at $116,885. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $116,616. It recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,624. BTC raced to a new all-time high on Monday, surging past $120,000 to $123,091. However, it lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $119,714. Source: TradingView Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as traders locked in their gains. As a result, BTC plunged to an intraday low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682, ultimately dropping 1.70%. BTC recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 1% to $118,641. The price faced volatility on Thursday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as BTC rose 0.39% and settled at $119,901. BTC raced to an intraday high of $120,800 on Friday. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $117,877, ultimately dropping 1.03%. Price action has been muted over the weekend, with BTC registering a marginal decline on Saturday and a marginal increase during the ongoing session.

In the past week, XRP’s market capitalization has surged by $40.54 billion, rising from $165.82 billion to $206.36 billion. This massive inflow drove the token’s price to $3.49, representing a 24.65% increase on the weekly timeframe. XRP one-week market cap chart. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP price prediction With XRP seemingly gearing up for a breakout, Finbold consulted OpenAI’s ChatGPT for insight into where the asset could be headed by year-end. According to the model, if current buying momentum holds, XRP could trade between $5 and $7 by December. ChatGPT noted that the surge will likely be fueled by sustained investor demand, which is reinforcing market momentum. At the same time, the anticipated decline in Bitcoin ( BTC ) dominance is likely to redirect capital into altcoins, signaling the start of an altseason, during which XRP, as a top-tier token, is poised to gain significantly. Adding to market optimism is growing regulatory clarity, especially in the U.S. After years of legal uncertainty, more explicit rules are helping to reduce risk for both institutional and retail investors. Notably, this comes as the U.S enacted the Genesis Act, which provides a legal framework for stablecoin, amid the final push towards ending the legal battle between Ripple and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). XRP price prediction. Source: ChatGPT Why XRP is breaking out It’s worth noting that, beyond tracking the broader crypto market , XRP’s rally is being driven by several key developments. Notably, momentum picked up following the approval of the ProShares XRP Futures ETF on July 19, sparking renewed interest from institutions. The move mirrors Bitcoin’s ETF-fueled surge earlier this year. Meanwhile, 11 spot XRP ETF applications are awaiting review, with traders estimating an 88% chance of approval by year-end. Finally, on-chain activity also spiked, with 1.7 billion XRP moved on July 18, marking the highest daily volume in a year and indicating potential whale accumulation, a traditionally bullish signal.

48600360,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=769802,1753019855,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48600360.jpeg,Euro debt deals surge in emerging markets as dollar loses appeal,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dollar-bears-push-emerging-markets-to-euro/,"Emerging-market governments and companies are rushing into the euro bond market faster than they have in over a decade, according to Bloomberg. With the dollar down nearly 8% this year and Trump’s return to the White House fueling uncertainty around tariffs and US economic policy, borrowers from Eastern Europe to Asia are looking for other options. And the euro is winning that attention. This year alone, developing economies have sold €89 billion worth of euro-denominated debt by July 18 — the highest amount for that time frame since at least 2014. That includes €21 billion from Poland and Romania alone. Government issuance has already blown past 2024’s full-year total. Poland even rolled out its first green bonds since 2017, and Bulgaria secured €3.2 billion in sales after a credit rating upgrade tied to its entry into the eurozone next year. These countries aren’t just experimenting. They’re using momentum to raise serious money fast. Romania, Poland, Chile, and more ditch dollars to raise euros Romania sold euro bonds for the third time this year after markets responded positively to May’s election of a centrist candidate. In Asia, South Korea and China both tapped the euro bond market. Even Chile jumped in. The crowd is growing, and there’s one thing they all have in common: none of them want to stay too exposed to the USD. Matthew Graves, a portfolio manager at PPM America, put it like this: “We have been more active in looking for opportunities outside of US dollars credits.” He prefers Ivory Coast’s euro bonds over its dollar debt, pointing to the stronger spreads. “Directionally, we like owning euros versus dollars right now.” That sentiment is being echoed across Wall Street. Strategists at Goldman Sachs ran comparisons between euro and dollar bonds issued by the same governments on the same day. The result? Euro bonds outperformed dollar ones more frequently one week after issuance. “The increase in euro-denominated bond issuance has generally been well absorbed by the market,” Kamakshya Trivedi and his team wrote earlier this month. They expect this to continue as the US economy slows and the dollar keeps losing ground. Big players reevaluate dollar strategy as euro gains appeal As the dollar weakens, the appetite for diversification is growing. Bank of America is betting on Romania’s 2044 euro bonds while holding a bearish view on its dollar notes with the same maturity. JPMorgan strategists, led by Stefan Weiler, say Poland, Hungary, Mexico, and Morocco offer some of the most attractive euro-denominated opportunities for investors moving away from dollar debt. Weiler, who heads debt capital markets for Central Europe, the Middle East and Africa at JPMorgan in London, made it clear: “If you have an ambition to issue in euros, this is the time to do it. Borrowers have been noticeably more active in diversifying and exploring also some niche markets.” David Robbins, co-head of TCW Emerging Markets Group, says investors still see value in emerging markets. “The relative yield advantage you’re getting in EM to what you’re getting in other markets continues to look attractive,” Robbins said. That interest is propping up debt sales across both euro and dollar markets. Even with the growth in euro issuance, dollar bonds are still moving fast. 2025 is already seeing the most dollar-denominated emerging-market debt sold since 2021. But the euro is making gains in all the right places. Brazil , which has already sold over $5 billion in dollar bonds this year, is preparing to issue its first euro-denominated bond since 2014. Colombia plans to follow, preparing its first euro bond sale since 2016. Egypt is also considering hard-currency issuance that includes euro debt in the next year. And in the Balkans, Bosnia-Herzegovina is about to join the international debt markets for the first time, with a five-year unsecured euro bond on deck. This isn’t just a passing trend. With Trump’s tariffs rattling global trade, the Federal Reserve caught in crossfire, and growth in the US not looking so “exceptional” anymore, investors are reassessing what they want in their portfolios. Borrowers are responding, and the euro is getting louder. The dollar might not be gone, but it’s definitely not alone anymore. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

( XYZ ) was one of the first public fintechs to incorporate bitcoin trading into the business, yet years later the business doesn't generate any material profits off cryptocurrency as the U.S. government starts approving cryptocurrency legislation. The stock is jumping on the surprise entry into S&P 500, leading to limited value in owning Block. My investment thesis is now Neutral on the stock, especially above $80, where Block likely trades when the market opens on Monday. Source: Finviz Limited Crypto Catalysts Years ago, Block would trade wildly based on revenues from bitcoin trading. Just in Q1'25, the fintech generated $2.30 billion in bitcoin trading revenues, but the company incurred a nearly equal $2.24 billion in transaction costs. Source: Block Q1'25 shareholder letter Block has offered bitcoin trading since 2018 , but the company has never moved beyond simple trading of the major crypto coin. Coinbase ( COIN ) has now developed a complete platform with trading in multiple coins and offering stablecoins to reach a market cap of over $100 billion, more than double Block. President Trump just approved the Genius Act to regulate stablecoins. The market is dominated by Coinbase and a few other players, while Block is nowhere to be found. The irony is that co-founder Jack Dorsey was one of the original proponents of bitcoin. Block owns over $1 billion worth of bitcoin based on owning 8,584 coins at the current price of $118K with a cost basis of only $261 million. Unfortunately, Block has remained stuck in focusing on the once innovative Cash App and moving into BNPL services. Neither, really offering the growth dynamics anymore offered by crypto. The company is starting to rollout bitcoin payments on Square in the 2H, with most sellers eligible in 2026. In addition, the company is developing bitcoin mining chips and systems under Proto with a business launch in the 2H, but the fintech isn't moving far beyond the natural crypto trading opportunity. For Q1, Block gross profits only grew 9% to $2.29 billion. Again, the fintech has substantial transaction costs so that gross profits work out to more of a net revenue figure. Either way, the stock can't really be valued based on total revenues due to the excessive bitcoin revenues without any profit benefit from the pass-through costs. The problem facing Block is that both Square and Cash App were innovative fintech products in the beginning, but the company no longer sees innovation outside of product tweaks. The Q1'25 shareholder letter focused on product innovation with up to 100 product enhancements to Square, but the new features to the technology platform aren't moving the growth needle. The biggest product appears to be Cash App Afterpay, a product designed for small amounts of borrowing within Cash App. S&P 500 Surprise After the close on Friday, Block was announced as the new entry into the S&P 500 before the opening of trading on July 23. The stock will enter the key index with trillions attached to the product after Hess (HES) was purchased by Chevron ( CVX ) and removed from the index. The stock soared 8.5% in after-market trading due to the surprise move. Block only had a market cap of $45 billion, with Robinhood ( HOOD ), the far more discussed fintech, set to enter the S&P 500 with the market cap soaring to $100 billion. Barron's even speculated on the next 4 stocks to be added to the index, and Block wasn't included. Source: Seeking Alpha Block traded at ~19x EPS targets for 2026. The stock currently trades at about 4.5x gross profit targets in the range of $10 billion for the year. The S&P 500 entry is likely to boost the stock in the 10% range, moving the forward P/E multiple to 21x. For a company with 9% gross profit growth targets, the stock trades at about fair value. Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that Block doesn't have the growth catalysts to chase the stock after this surprise S&P 500 entry bump when trading opens up Monday. The company has missed the crypto craze, and the current projects don't appear to move the needle. Investors can hold the stock next week, but one shouldn't chase Block on the entry into the S&P 500.",XYZ,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|BTC|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-20 14:00:00

IMF Claims the Country Is Not Buying Bitcoin Every Day,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-el-salvador-lying-imf-claims-the-country-is-not-buying-bitcoin-every-day/,"According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s first program review report published on July 15, the government of El Salvador has not made any new Bitcoin purchases since February 2025. This information was revealed in an official letter signed by the country's Central Bank President, Douglas Pablo Rodríguez Fuentes, and Finance Minister, Jerson Rogelio Posada Molina, and submitted to the IMF. The letter states that El Salvador's public sector Bitcoin holdings “have not changed.” Attached documents note that the country's hot and cold wallet addresses have been handed over to the IMF for auditing and monitoring purposes. This statement clearly contradicts previous statements by President Nayib Bukele and El Salvador's Bitcoin Office, which claimed that 1 BTC has been purchased daily since November 2022. The Bukele administration claims that the country's BTC reserves have reached approximately 6,242 BTC, worth around $737 million. Blockchain analysis firm Arkham also provided on-chain data confirming daily transfers of 1 BTC from wallets labeled Binance and Bitfinex. However, the IMF report suggests that these transfers are not new purchases, but rather a consolidation of existing Bitcoin holdings in government wallets. A footnote in the report states, “Increases in the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Fund are due to the consolidation of Bitcoins held in different government wallets.” Related News: What Lies Ahead for Solana (SOL) Prices? Analysis Company Releases Technical Analysis President Bukele has repeatedly stated that they will continue to buy Bitcoin, despite reaching a $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF. In a post on social media platform X, he said, “Even when the world ostracized us and many abandoned us, these purchases didn't stop; they won't stop now, and they won't stop in the future.” Stacy Herbert, director of the Bitcoin Office, argued in a March post on X that El Salvador continued to buy Bitcoin despite the IMF agreement. Herbert said, “Some ‘Bitcoin’ supporters are relying on the IMF’s word rather than El Salvador’s purchases recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain.” *This is not investment advice.
