The Ministry of Internal Affairs, together with the police forces, has begun work to establish an official system to sell this large cryptocurrency stock. The total value of the cryptocurrencies seized by police is unknown, but in 2018 alone, 61,000 Bitcoins belonging to a China-based pyramid scheme were seized. At the time, the assets were worth around £270 million, but with Bitcoin reaching $123,000 (about £92,000) last week, they are now worth more than £5.4 billion. The government plans to develop a “crypto custody and sales framework” to securely store and sell these digital assets. It's not yet clear how much of the proceeds from sales will be transferred to the treasury, but proceeds from crime are typically shared between the central government and law enforcement. When victims remain unidentified, the treasury is known to receive a larger share.

High inflation and interest rates are driving up borrowing costs, while weak economic growth is weighing on revenue. The Treasury is reportedly considering alternative revenue streams, including tax increases. In particular, the positive steps taken by the Donald Trump administration toward cryptocurrencies in the US and the passage of the first national cryptocurrency law, the “Genius Act,” have led to a significant increase in Bitcoin prices. These developments are expected to inspire similar strategies in the UK. In the US, the Trump administration aims to create a national reserve using the $3.4 billion in confiscated Bitcoin. In the UK, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage advocates for the UK to create a national Bitcoin reserve, but the Labour Party has rejected the proposal due to the cryptocurrency's high volatility. *This is not investment advice.

The team confirmed that trading will commence after a step-by-step rollout, with only select community tokens initially unlocked at launch. Team and advisor tokens will remain locked. Rollout to Begin With Community Token Unlocks World Liberty Financial stated that only a portion of the community-held WLFI tokens will be unlocked initially. These were bought during earlier sales at $0.015 and $0.05. The remaining tokens, including those held by the team and advisors, will stay locked. Unlocking any of these in the future will depend on community votes. According to a post on the project’s official X page, the token’s tradability has been approved. However, the full rollout will take between six and eight weeks. During this time, the team will finalise listings and secure more exchange partnerships. The team also made it clear that there are no hidden allocations. They said no insider, advisor, or team tokens will be released at launch. This, they added, is part of their focus on fairness and building trust with early supporters. Tokens held in the treasury will be partly unlocked to support liquidity. WLFI Team Drops Second Presale, Shifts to Rewards Plans for a second presale have been dropped. Instead, World Liberty Financial is working with centralised exchanges to roll out a reward system. This will enable new users to earn WLFI tokens by participating in supported activities on these platforms. The team explained that they are not in a rush. Their focus is on building something solid that aligns with their values. They also stated that the WLFI token represents a long-term project, shaped by planning and user input. In related news, World Liberty Financial, linked to U.S. President Donald Trump, has released an audit of its stablecoin reserves, confirming that its WLFI governance token has become transferable. In related news, the Trump family has reportedly cut back its stake in World Liberty Financial (WLFI) following rising criticism . This is particularly true for Democratic lawmakers regarding Donald Trump’s ties to the crypto project. Community to Decide What Comes Next It is also important to note that the WLFI token will be listed on both centralized and decentralized platforms once the rollout is complete. Future steps, such as more token unlocks or changes to access, will be decided through community votes. Last week, the project completed a vote confirming the token’s tradability . With that in place, the team says it is now focused on doing things the right way. Notably, the proposal, submitted by the WLFI team on July 9, closed on Wednesday with a near-unanimous 99.94% in favor. Additionally, a recent update revealed that Aqua 1, a Web3-native fund, has invested $100 million to support the WLFI token’s role in the DeFi space .

Responding to her post, XRP community members began connecting her presence in the city to the absence of Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse at the GENIUS Act signing event held in the White House. This theory gained traction when Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse was notably absent from the recent White House signing of the GENIUS Act , which establishes the first comprehensive federal framework for stablecoin regulation in the U.S. IMF at @Ripple Headquarters SF https://t.co/Iwf4uIAEeO — Nathaniel C. J. Rothschild (@NCJRothschild) July 19, 2025 Improving Clarity for Cryptocurrencies in the U.S. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, attended the signing ceremony on July 18, where President Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act into law. This marked a major step forward in clarifying the legal environment for digital assets. Two other crypto-related bills, the Clarity for Digital Tokens Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act , also passed the House but remain pending in the Senate. The Clarity Act seeks to define when a digital asset is a security or commodity, while the Anti-CBDC Act would prohibit the Federal Reserve from issuing a retail central bank digital currency. While Garlinghouse celebrated this development , he was absent from the event. With the IMF’s managing director in San Francisco, one community member jokingly suggested that Garlinghouse had more important business to attend to, suggesting a secret meeting with representatives from the IMF. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is Ripple Working With the IMF? While there is no official confirmation of a meeting between both parties, some see it as a plausible scenario given the IMF’s prior comments on XRP. In 2023, an IMF document discussed the potential of digital assets, including XRP, to improve cross-border payments and address inefficiencies in existing systems. Garlinghouse has also previously made a case for XRP to the IMF and the Swiss National Bank. The timing also coincides with growing regulatory clarity in the US. With the GENIUS Act now signed and other legislation progressing, Ripple’s positioning as a cross-border payments solution provider could benefit from high-level discussions with global financial institutions. For now, however, this remains informal speculation. Still, for XRP enthusiasts, the possibility of a Ripple and IMF alignment carries significance and may happen down the line as XRP’s global relevance increases.

The chipmaker announced this week it plans to restart H20 exports to China, pending U.S. license approvals. Sources told The Information that an April ban by U.S. authorities on H20 shipments compelled Nvidia to cancel orders and give up its reserved production slots at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC). At a Beijing event, CEO Jensen Huang explained that TSMC reallocated those assembly lines to different products, and re-establishing them could require up to nine months. Huang added that once granted, export licenses for Chinese orders would be processed swiftly, and that Nvidia is preparing to increase its chip deliveries. In a separate statement, China’s commerce ministry said the U.S. indicated it would approve exports of H20 chips to Chinese buyers. Huang confirmed that demand remains strong but emphasized that shipments still depend on final license clearances. The company is also designing a graphics card for the Chinese market called the RTX Pro GPU, which meets U.S. export regulations and targets automated manufacturing operations and robotics training. Huang sold $50 million in Nvidia stock this week On Friday, Huang sold 75,000 Nvidia shares valued at approximately $12.94 million as part of a March plan permitting sales of up to 6 million shares. Earlier in the week, he divested 225,000 shares for about $37 million under the same arrangement. A spike in AI demand and the GPUs that underpin large language models have driven Huang’s personal fortune upward and pushed Nvidia’s market capitalization beyond $4 trillion, ranking it as the most valuable firm globally. On his third trip to China this year, Huang held talks with Commerce Minister Wang Wentao, who pressed global firms such as Nvidia to supply dependable, top‑tier offerings to Chinese consumers. Wang reiterated that China remains committed to attracting foreign investment and plans to further expand market access. Huang also met with Ren Hongbin, head of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and Vice Premier He Lifeng. At a Beijing press conference on Wednesday, he praised AI models from Deepseek, Alibaba, and Tencent as “world class” and said AI is “revolutionising” supply chains.

This projection isn’t just boosting BTC’s appeal—it’s igniting interest across the altcoin space, especially among presale tokens with strong utility and growth potential. One name that’s starting to stand out is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a decentralized finance project gaining attention as it approaches a major milestone: over 80% of its presale Phase 5 is now sold out, and a 20% price increase is just around the corner. Bitcoin’s Momentum Is Fueling Altcoin Opportunities With fresh capital flowing into spot Bitcoin ETFs and global sentiment improving, Bitcoin’s push toward six figures is more than just speculation—it’s becoming a broader signal of renewed confidence in the cryptocurrency market. The narrative is shifting back to fundamentals, and that momentum is lifting not only BTC, but also altcoins that bring real value and clear use cases to the table. While many are watching Bitcoin for long-term gains, others are looking at what $1,000 invested today might become in tokens that haven’t hit the open market yet. That’s exactly why attention is turning toward Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is building a lending and borrowing protocol that operates without centralized control. Everything runs on smart contracts, which means users keep control of their assets while interacting with fully transparent and automated lending markets. The process is straightforward. Lenders deposit assets like ETH or stablecoins into Mutuum’s liquidity pools and receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens represent their share of the pool and automatically increase in value over time as interest accrues. When it’s time to withdraw, users can exchange their mtTokens back for the underlying asset along with the interest that’s accumulated. No need to wait for a match or counterparty. The smart contract handles everything in real time. Borrowers, on the other hand, can tap into liquidity by posting overcollateralized assets. This means that to borrow $1,000, a user would typically need to secure the loan with around $1,500 in digital assets as collateral. This structure ensures stability and keeps the protocol solvent, while still giving users access to capital without selling their holdings. And because borrowers can choose between stable or variable interest rates, the system works for both short-term flexibility and longer-term strategies. What makes Mutuum different is that these mechanics are not theoretical. The protocol is already under development, and its beta version is expected to go live alongside the token launch—a clear sign that this isn’t just a whitepaper project. A Stablecoin That Makes Sense In addition to its lending platform, Mutuum is also building an overcollateralized stablecoin that will be fully backed by assets supplied within the ecosystem. This stablecoin will maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar through on-chain mechanisms—not through external custodians or unverifiable reserves. To generate the stablecoin, users must deposit collateral exceeding the value of the tokens they mint. Once the borrowed amount is repaid, those stablecoins are permanently removed from circulation. This system prevents inflation while preserving full transparency. Unlike many existing stablecoins that rely on trust in third parties, Mutuum’s model is algorithmic, decentralized, and designed to maintain long-term reliability. It’s another layer of utility that gives the MUTM token real-world function within the protocol. Interest generated from stablecoin borrowing goes directly to the treasury, reinforcing the ecosystem’s value over time. Nearly Sold Out Before Phase 6 The presale has already passed some major milestones. Over $12.6 million has been raised, with more than 13,600 holders joining so far. With more than 80% of Phase 5 already completed, the $0.03 price point is approaching its final stretch. As the presale moves into Phase 6, the token price is set to rise to $0.035, marking a 20% increase for incoming participants. That price will continue to climb across the remaining phases until launch, where MUTM is expected to list at $0.06. Those entering now are looking at a potential 2x gain before the token even hits exchanges. Adding to the momentum is the completion of a full audit by CertiK, which gave Mutuum a score of 95, confirming the security and readiness of its smart contracts. To encourage continued transparency and safety, the team also launched a $50,000 bug bounty program and a $100,000 giveaway for early contributors—both of which have helped strengthen engagement from new and existing investors. Mutuum Finance is gaining attention at the right time. As Bitcoin pushes toward $150K and overall sentiment shifts back to growth, early-stage projects with clear fundamentals are in the spotlight. Mutuum checks all the right boxes: functional design, audited smart contracts, passive income potential, and additional utility through its upcoming stablecoin. The presale won’t stay open forever, and with a 20% price increase confirmed for Phase 6, those considering an entry point may not have much time left. As market momentum builds, the opportunity to secure a position at $0.03 might soon be gone. For investors asking what cryptocurrency to invest in now, especially with a long-term outlook, MUTM looks like more than just a promising altcoin—it’s shaping up to be one of the best crypto investments heading into 2026.

Some are proving their value through real traction, scale, and strategic vision. BlockDAG, Stellar, Hedera, and Cronos are four standout names pushing in unique directions while capturing attention for all the right reasons. With bold partnerships, inventive presale strategies, and steady demand from retail and institutions alike, these four are reshaping expectations. If you’re watching for the top performing crypto this year, what they’re achieving now deserves a closer look before the opportunity slips away. BlockDAG: Smashing Records With a 3025% ROI Potential BlockDAG’s presale is turning heads across the entire market, and for good reason. Built on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, it promises lightning-fast speeds, scalability, and unmatched energy efficiency. Its low-energy consensus model supports parallel transaction processing, making it ideal for massive usage from DeFi to real-world integrations. Already, BlockDAG has raised over $343 million, moved 24 billion coins, and signed up more than 200,000 holders. Even now, the BDAG price remains fixed at just $0.0016 until August 11 , which is far below its confirmed launch price of $0.05. That leaves room for a rare, market-defying 3025% return, even for those joining late. On top of that, BlockDAG is offering what few others dare: full access. For the next 8 days only, all BDAG purchased directly unlock instantly at launch through the NO VESTING PASS. For anyone eyeing the top-performing crypto, BlockDAG offers both massive upside and immediate usability, an irresistible combination in a market full of delays and empty promises. Stellar: Closing the Distance on Global Transfers Stellar is redefining cross-border payments, delivering low-cost, fast transactions on a decentralized network. Its high-profile partnerships with MoneyGram, Visa, and IBM have secured its place in the fintech world. With more than 3.5 billion transactions across 6 million accounts, it continues to deliver measurable utility year after year. The addition of Soroban smart contracts gives Stellar a solid DeFi angle, though its main strength remains adoption over speculation. Currently trading around $0.26, some analysts predict it could reach $2.60 by 2026. For anyone prioritizing strong infrastructure and proven institutional trust over hype cycles, Stellar still shines as a top performing crypto, particularly for bridging the gap between digital and fiat payment systems. Hedera: Built for Enterprise-Grade Speed and Scale Hedera leverages a hashgraph consensus mechanism to provide fast, efficient, and eco-friendly transactions, a combination that has attracted heavyweights like Google, IBM, and Boeing. Its enterprise-grade approach delivers thousands of transactions per second, built for reliability and scalability. HBAR currently trades near $0.16 with a $6.8 billion market cap. Analysts forecast potential growth toward $2.00 in the coming years, fueled by pilots in CBDCs and increased business adoption. While its DeFi presence is still modest, its solid tech appeals strongly to institutions. For those watching for a top performing crypto focused more on utility and partnerships than flashy price moves, Hedera remains a smart contender. Cronos: Building Steadily in DeFi and NFTs Cronos powers the Crypto.com ecosystem as a Layer 1 blockchain, carving a niche in DeFi and NFT activity. Its proof-of-stake architecture ensures low transaction costs and compatibility with Ethereum assets, boosting its flexibility and reach. Recent ETF-driven excitement pushed CRO’s price up to $0.09, with a $3.1 billion market cap. Analysts see potential for it to climb as high as $1.80 by 2026, depending on continued DeFi expansion and rising user engagement. Although it doesn’t dominate headlines, Cronos’s integration into a major exchange keeps it highly visible. Among the top performing crypto options tied to ecosystem-driven growth, Cronos stands out as a steady, long-term player quietly gaining ground. Final Take: Who’s Pulling Ahead? These projects each deliver something different. Stellar focuses on global payments with real institutional backing. Hedera provides enterprise-ready infrastructure with exceptional speed and scale. Cronos thrives within its ecosystem through consistent DeFi and NFT activity. But BlockDAG stands out, delivering a rare mix of technical ambition, unmatched accessibility, and measurable progress. While others are laying foundations, BlockDAG is already generating numbers that hint at much more than just potential. In the race for top performing crypto , BDAG is closing the gap between market excitement and tangible results faster than most imagined.

According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, this historical indicator previously preceded a massive 630% surge in XRP’s price back in 2024 . Now, with the same signal flashing again, the analyst points to the potential of another strong move to the upside. XRP Price Flashes Historically Bullish Signal A potentially explosive historical signal has just resurfaced on the XRP price chart , fueling optimism for a potential breakout ahead. In his latest XRP analysis report on X social media, Martinez reveals that the cryptocurrency’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio has flashed a Golden Cross—a pattern generally associated with powerful bullish momentum. Martinez highlighted that the last time his MVRV ratio crossover appeared, in 2024, XRP skyrocketed by over 630%, marking one of its most dramatic price moves in recent years. Now, the same bullish pattern has been triggered again, fueling speculation of a potential history repeat . The analyst’s chart shows the MVRV ratio, in orange, spiking above its 200-day Moving Average (MA) , in red, with XRP’s price already beginning to respond positively. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.43, displaying healthy momentum compared to past months, during which its price was stuck in a consolidation range above $2. Although the cryptocurrency surged significantly above $3.5 earlier this week, it has since retraced by approximately 3.8% to its current price, according to CoinMarketCap. If history is any guide, the reemergence of the MVRV ratio Golden Cross could open the door to further upside, potentially positioning XRP for a new multi-month rally. Members of the crypto community who have taken note of this historically bullish signal are already forecasting a potential surge to $22, representing a whopping 541% climb from XRP’s current levels. Analyst Sets XRP Price Target Above $20 The XRP price could see a historic rally to new all-time highs before the end of this cycle, as an X crypto market expert, Shawn Mark, points to past chart patterns that suggest a potential surge above $20 is imminent. According to the analysis, XRP has just broken out of a multi-year consolidation phase within a Symmetrical Triangle pattern , similar to the one it formed before its explosive surge in the 2017 bull cycle. Back then, XRP skyrocketed from under $0.01 to nearly $3.50 in a parabolic move, representing a more than 60x increase. Now, current chart formations suggest that the latest triangle breakout mirrors the same historic pattern almost identically. If this fractal plays out again with similar bullish momentum, XRP’s projected target this time could land in the $20 range, with a precise peak prediction at $20.25.",XRP|Ali Martinez|golden cross|MA|Market Value to Realized Value|moving average|MVRV|Shawn Mark|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|BTC|FIAT|ADA|TRADING|DOGE|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|ZRX|TOKEN SALE|XRP|TREASURY|SPONSORED|SOL|EXCHANGE|BNB|USDT|ALGO|BCH|PYUSD|TRX|FORKS|RESEARCH|ASIA|TECHNOLOGY|MINING|PEPE|USDC|SHIB|BITTENSOR|WALLET|ARKM|BONK,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-07-19 22:00:29

China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is considering a six-month embargo on the resale of newly registered vehicles, which many see as a big swing to stamp out the practice of “ zero-mileage used car ” sales. The potential crackdown, which was reported by Auto Review, a publication affiliated with the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), is Beijing’s first concrete response to the long-standing issue in its highly competitive car market. China is considering a six-month ban on car resale The zero-mileage phenomenon refers to vehicles that are technically classified as used, despite never having been driven or transferred to actual buyers. Automakers and dealers achieve this by registering cars and insuring them before final sale, allowing them to meet aggressive internal sales quotas and report stronger performance figures. The measure, if implemented, would prevent any vehicle from being resold within six months of registration, curbing the manipulation of insurance and licensing data to record inflated sales. The issue gained national attention in May after Great Wall Motor’s CEO, Wei Jianjun, publicly criticized the scheme. The Communist Party’s People’s Daily also ran an editorial last month condemning the sale of zero-mileage used cars. China’s cabinet recently pledged to increase its supervision of the domestic auto market. According to Auto Review, automakers, including BYD and Chery, are now considering penalizing dealers who engage in practices like pre-licensing unsold vehicles. The China Automobile Dealers Association has also proposed a code system for tracking used car exports, which could further limit abuse of the policy loophole. Zeekr and Neta face accusations of inflating sales with pre-insured cars New revelations from Reuters also exposed how two Chinese electric vehicle brands, Zeekr and Neta, booked tens of thousands of sales using the pre-insurance tactic. Neta, owned by Zhejiang Hozon New Energy Automobile, pre-insured over 64,000 vehicles between January 2023 and March 2024, which accounts for more than half of its reported sales during that period. In many cases, buyers were unaware that the insurance had already begun and only discovered the discrepancy when the insurance policies expired sooner than expected. The dealers are claiming they were pressured to move the inventory and explain away early-expiring traffic insurance as “complimentary.” The strategy reportedly began in late 2022 and continued well into 2024, even as the company’s finances deteriorated. Neta’s parent company entered bankruptcy proceedings last month, and first-quarter sales for 2025 plunged to just over 1,200 vehicles. Zeekr, a premium EV brand owned by Geely Auto, similarly recorded inflated year-end sales in 2024 with the help of its state-owned dealership partner, Xiamen C&D. Data showed that out of the 2,737 cars “sold” in Xiamen that month, only 271 were actually registered for license plates, which is a necessary step for delivery to real buyers. The buyers reported being lured into purchasing these cars with discounts and promotional offers. One Zeekr customer said a salesperson promised a 3,000 yuan discount and a 10,000 yuan charging coupon, but the car came with a pre-existing insurance policy registered under Xiamen C&D. Zeekr has denied the state media reports, while Neta and Xiamen C&D did not respond to inquiries.

However, the premier cryptocurrency has experienced a slight price retracement since reaching this milestone. Interestingly, this fall in Bitcoin market prices has collided with a widespread gain in the altcoin market, with specific large-cap tokens notching up remarkable gains. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Not Over Yet? Short-Term Holder MVRV Suggests Further Upside 7-Day SMA Bitcoin Whale Exchange Transfers Near 12,000 BTC – Glassnode In an X post of July 18, prominent blockchain analytics firm Glassnode shares a profound on-chain insight on the Bitcoin market, stating that the volume of whale transfers to exchanges is presently on the rise. Notably, this development comes as Bitcoin experiences a moderate price correction after reaching a new ATH earlier last week, as previously stated. Glassnode explains that the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of BTC transferred from whale wallets to exchanges is approaching 12,000 BTC, one of the highest weekly volumes recorded in 2025. Interestingly, this surge in transfer mirrors levels last seen in early November 2024, a period that preceded a popular crypto bull run. When large holders move their BTC to centralized exchanges, it typically suggests they are preparing to liquidate some or all of their positions, either to take profits or to rotate capital into other opportunities. However, the latter scenario seems likely, especially considering recent trends in the altcoin market. Amidst Bitcoin’s price correction, several altcoins have recorded significant price gains, prompting ideas that the altseason may have begun. For context, data from CoinMarketCap shows that the premier cryptocurrency experienced a mere 0.27% gain over the past week, while altcoins such as Ethereum, XRP, and Solana registered price surges of 19.98%, 25.98%, and 8.86%, respectively. Historically, this development mirrors a characteristic altseason, when other cryptocurrencies generally outperform Bitcoin, leading to a decline in Bitcoin’s market dominance. Altseasons are triggered when investors begin reallocating profits from BTC into higher-beta assets, seeking larger returns due to the lower market caps of these tokens. However, more data from CoinMarketCap shows the altseason index is at 36/100, indicating that while altcoins are beginning to gain momentum, the market has not yet fully transitioned into a confirmed altseason. An index value below 50 suggests that Bitcoin is still outperforming a majority of altcoins over 90 days. Investors should stay alert for a cross above 75 which would suggest a full-fledged altseason to be declared.

In July 2025, utility is becoming the defining factor in long-term portfolio growth. Developers, creators, and institutional backers are favoring assets backed by real infrastructure and usage. Among the tokens showing exceptional promise this cycle are Hedera, OpenFundNet (OFNT) , Kaspa, FloppyPepe, and Chainlink — each with unique strengths rooted in real-world use. Hedera (HBAR): Public Ledger for Enterprises Hedera continues to lead the way in enterprise blockchain adoption. Its unique hashgraph consensus mechanism provides lightning-fast and low-cost transactions, which is essential for high-throughput business applications. Institutions like Avery Dennison and DBS Bank are already building on the network, making HBAR one of the most commercially viable L1 solutions. If the broader altcoin market continues to rise, HBAR is well-positioned for a bullish July. Source: Coingecko – Hedera OpenFundNet (OFNT): Web3 Launchpad and DAO Infrastructure OpenFundNet is emerging as a game-changer in the Web3 creator economy. It enables users to launch token presales, DAOs, and staking platforms without writing a single line of code. This no-code infrastructure is making decentralized crowdfunding accessible to a broader creator base. By bundling a launchpad, DAO builder, and staking platform into one seamless ecosystem, OFNT is laying the groundwork for the next generation of crypto projects. Its all-in-one ecosystem lowers the barrier for builders and creators to access decentralized crowdfunding. With a zero-fee structure and milestone-based funding, OFNT ensures transparency and trust between funders and projects. This innovative model positions OFNT as a core launchpad for the next wave of crypto startups. Kaspa (KAS): Speed and Finality in One Kaspa’s GHOSTDAG protocol makes it one of the fastest Layer-1s on the market, offering instant finality and high throughput. It has become increasingly popular among miners and developers alike, especially those focused on building low-latency payment systems. Its strong open-source community and robust technical foundation make KAS a valuable addition to portfolios betting on next-gen infrastructure. With Bitcoin’s momentum continuing, Kaspa is likely to benefit from spillover bullish sentiment. Source: Coingecko – Kaspa FloppyPepe (FPPE): Creator Monetization Meets Meme Culture FloppyPepe takes meme culture to the next level by building creator monetization tools directly into its ecosystem. Through platforms like FloppyAI and Meme-o-matic, users can turn memes and content ideas into monetizable NFTs or viral assets. The FPPE token fuels these platforms, providing incentives and rewards for creative engagement. Its ongoing “double your tokens” presale promo is driving massive traction, positioning FPPE as a meme coin with serious functionality. Chainlink (LINK): The Oracle Backbone of DeFi Chainlink remains the most trusted oracle network in the DeFi sector, connecting blockchains with off-chain data and real-world assets. With growing institutional collaborations like those with SWIFT and DTCC, LINK is expanding beyond retail DeFi use cases. Staking mechanisms and broader adoption of RWAs continue to strengthen Chainlink’s fundamentals. For investors focused on infrastructure and scalability, LINK continues to be a reliable long-term asset. Source: Coingecko – Chainlink Comparing Utility and Investor Incentives BTC Bull focuses on sentiment trading and caters to Bitcoin Maxis with limited direct utility. FloppyPepe offers AI meme tools and NFT creation, combining meme appeal with actual monetization features. OpenFundNet (OFNT) stands out with its zero-fee structure, allowing users to launch presales, DAOs, and staking platforms without coding. Qubetics integrates AI and blockchain for scalable infrastructure, focusing on real-world enterprise solutions. Real Utility Tokens Will Outlast the Hype Utility tokens are proving to be more than just short-term plays — they’re forming the backbone of the next crypto wave. While meme tokens like FloppyPepe inject energy into the space, it’s utility-rich assets like OpenFundNet that are powering the infrastructure behind the scenes. Whether through launching DAOs, staking platforms, or crowdfunding mechanisms, OFNT delivers real tools for real builders. For investors seeking long-term relevance and explosive upside, OFNT stands out as one of July’s most strategic allocations.

Not every top crypto pick is moving the same way. The PUMP token price is gaining energy after its first buyback, with signs of a breakout coming soon. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) is cooling off after hitting $700, facing resistance as many locked in gains. In the middle of all this, BlockDAG (BDAG) is taking a surprising path. It has removed vesting rules with a fresh twist called the NO VESTING PASS. This pass lets all buyers get their coins at launch. No waiting. With just 6 days left for this offer, BlockDAG has turned normal presale rules upside down along with its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. PUMP Token Nears Breakout After Buyback The PUMP token price recently climbed to $0.006144 after its first official buyback. This caught the market’s attention and pushed the price into a tight symmetrical triangle pattern. The trading volume jumped over 140%, and holders now number more than 40,000. Experts are watching closely as PUMP nears a key resistance zone at $0.0062. Although there’s strong momentum, a full breakout hasn’t happened yet. Support lies between $0.0052 and $0.0057, giving PUMP some breathing space if it slows down. With more people entering the market, the PUMP token price is on breakout alert, but it still needs to confirm the move before anything is certain. BNB Falls Below $700 After Rally The recent Binance Coin (BNB) price update shows nearly a 2% drop in 24 hours, pulling back to around $680 after touching $700. Many users took profits after Bitcoin crossed $120,000, causing a ripple effect that also cooled down BNB. Technical signs are mixed. Strong resistance remains between $690 and $695. Still, a short bounce from $675 brought in some fresh buying. Despite BNB marking its 8th year and burning $1B, short-term direction remains unclear. The Binance Coin price depends now on whether bulls can break above resistance, or if the drop will continue. BlockDAG Presale Surges Beyond $342M With NO VESTING PASS Boost BlockDAG’s presale is setting new records. It has already raised over $342 million and sold 24 billion BDAG coins. More than 200,000 people around the world are holding BDAG, and 2 million users are actively mining with the X1 app, driving fresh energy every day. What’s the price? Right now, it’s just $0.0016 until the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11. That’s a rare chance to grab BDAG before it lists at $0.05, offering a possible 3025% return. And here’s the game-changer: BlockDAG has launched the NO VESTING PASS. Unlike other presales that lock coins or delay access, this pass gives buyers full control. Anyone who buys BDAG within the next 6 days gets 100% of their coins on launch day. No waiting. No lock-ins. The NO VESTING PASS completely removes all unlocking phases and timelines. Buyers get everything right when BDAG goes live. This isn’t just about getting in early, it’s about having real control from day one. Instead of watching your gains roll out slowly, you can make use of the full 3025% potential right away. With demand for BDAG growing fast, this feature brings a freedom most other projects don’t offer. BlockDAG is rewarding belief in the project, and it’s doing it without delay. Key Takeaway In this market, timing is everything. While PUMP is waiting to break out and BNB struggles with resistance, both are stuck in “wait and see” mode. But BlockDAG is already moving fast. It has raised $342 million, sold 24 billion coins, and introduced a major change with the NO VESTING PASS. This feature lets buyers unlock 100% of their BDAG coins the moment the coin launches. No waiting. No delays. And with a possible 3025% upside, it’s a big shift from how most crypto launches work. This 10-day NO VESTING PASS is only available for a limited time. Now, just 6 days are left. While others wait for breakout signs, BlockDAG is already delivering results. It’s not just another project, it’s the one already paying off.

These bullish projections come as XRP hits price levels not seen in the past seven years. The analysis also outlines how the cryptocurrency could perform through the end of July and what targets it might hit by year-end. XRP On Track To $5 By End Of July In one of his latest video analyses on X (formerly Twitter), Hilton shared his outlook on where XRP could be heading in the next few weeks. The analyst pointed out that the cryptocurrency’s price trajectory has already accelerated significantly since breaking above the $3.5 level earlier this week. Over the past 24 days, XRP has also posted an impressive 77% gain, further fueling bullish sentiment. Related Reading: XRP MVRV Ratio Flashes Signal That Last Led To 630% Surge Thanks to its strong price performance these past few days, Hilton notes that XRP is now less than 10% away from reclaiming its all-time high of $3.84, set almost eight years ago. He emphasized that the popular altcoin is currently exceeding expectations, with its price surging well ahead of schedule. With bullish momentum showing no signs of slowing down, the analyst predicts that XRP could reach $5 by the end of July. He attributes this potential upswing to strong liquidity flowing across the broader market, combined with rising demand and sustained bullish sentiment as the market enters a new phase of its cycle. Backing his forecast, Hilton mentioned the recent surge in XRP capital inflows. He noted that the cryptocurrency’s market value has surged from around $140 – $150 billion to over $207 billion in just one week. He further credited this influx of capital to growing institutional interest, compounded by Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO), driving fresh entries into the market. Year-End Forecast Sees XRP Gunning For $20 Looking further out, Hilton has revised his end-of-year projection, citing the ongoing strength of XRP’s rally and improving market fundamentals. Initially, when XRP was trading within the $2 range, the analyst had projected a conservative year-end target between $5 and $10, even describing the lower end of that range as extremely modest. However, with the altcoin‘s price now solidly sitting above $3, he sees the potential for a more aggressive push in the months ahead. His updated outlook includes a baseline target of $10, which he now views as the low end of his bullish possibilities. On the higher end, he sees $15 as a realistic stretch target, and a run to $20 as a possible explosive climax before the year ends. Related Reading: XRP Open Interest Just Hit A Fresh ATH Above $10 Billion, Will Price Follow Next? Several factors have been suggested as potential catalysts for this optimistic prediction, including XRP’s rising market capitalization, anticipation of a potential XRP ETF, and the long-awaited resolution and settlement of the Ripple-SEC lawsuit. Hilton has suggested all these factors are aligning to place XRP in a prime position for an explosive rally this year.

The project announced on the social media platform X that it had joined the task force to “discuss the need for standards enabling the compliant issuance and trading of tokenized assets at scale.” “For the blockchain industry to reach its full potential and tap institutional capital, meeting regulatory requirements is essential. Only Chainlink provides the compliance, privacy, cross-chain, and data infrastructure needed to scale digital asset adoption in a single platform.

BONK is edging closer to the $0.00004 mark, but rapid climbs like this often run into pushback. Polkadot also shows promise with a clean technical setup, though its price history tends to defy the textbook playbook. Then there is BlockDAG, which is not waiting for signals. It is taking action now. With the NO VESTING PASS active for only six days, every BDAG coin purchased during this period comes with full access at launch. While BONK and DOT chase momentum, BlockDAG is handing out real utility and early liquidity. The race has already begun. BONK Approaches $0.00004: Questions About Pace Remain BONK has climbed steadily from under $0.0000150 to around $0.0000279, with its current price target now zeroing in on $0.00004. The move is supported by growing volume and technical strength, including bullish MACD readings and improving sentiment that aligns with optimism on market cycle models. However, this recent acceleration raises concerns about whether BONK can maintain its current pace. The chart suggests strong momentum, but some traders are beginning to watch for signs of exhaustion. As BONK nears its next key level, the question becomes whether it can hold or face a short-term cooldown. Polkadot Faces Uncertainty Around Key Supply Levels The Polkadot price outlook is centered on how DOT will behave near a visible H2 supply zone. The token recently surged without executing a common liquidity sweep, leaving two equal lows beneath the current price. This setup could invite downside pressure if traders attempt to test those levels. Still, DOT has a history of skipping expected chart behaviors, which introduces uncertainty. While a pause or minor pullback is on the table, there is also room for a move higher if the market rejects the overhead supply. The current outlook remains a balance of structure and probability. BlockDAG’s NO VESTING PASS Creates Rare Window for Full Launch Access BlockDAG is giving buyers something rarely seen in a presale of this scale: full control and instant access. For the next six days, the NO VESTING PASS allows anyone purchasing BDAG coins to receive 100% of their allocation on launch day. No schedules, no delays, just full liquidity the moment the presale ends and trading begins. This feature is adding fuel to a presale that has already hit historic milestones. BlockDAG has raised over $342 million and sold 24 billion coins. The special $0.0016 GLOBAL LAUNCH price remains active until August 11, offering a potential 3,025% return against the confirmed $0.05 listing price. The NO VESTING PASS amplifies that upside by making every coin instantly tradable at launch. With momentum building fast, buyers are jumping in to secure both price advantage and early liquidity. This level of flexibility is a major draw, especially as BlockDAG approaches its final presale phase. It adds confidence for those looking to act now rather than wait out traditional lockup periods. The community continues to expand with over 2 million X1 app miners and more than 200,000 BDAG holders. The NO VESTING PASS does more than unlock coins. It unlocks access to one of the most aggressive early-stage crypto opportunities of the year. Quick Recap While traders track the BONK price target and analyze the Polkadot price outlook, BlockDAG is skipping the speculation. Its presale is moving fast, backed by action rather than waiting games. With momentum surging, BlockDAG is changing the pace and giving buyers a clear advantage. The limited-time NO VESTING PASS means buyers receive full access to their BDAG at launch, with no lockups or holding periods. Combined with a potential 3,025% ROI at the current $0.0016 price, BlockDAG is positioning itself as one of the top crypto gainers with real liquidity from day one.

Could that next gem be now ? With Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) gaining momentum, and Shiba Inu and Baby Doge Coin making strategic moves, investors are watching closely. But while Shiba and Baby Doge have carved out their place, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale has stirred up a different kind of excitement, an opportunity still within reach. Now at the Icebound Estates stage, Arctic Pablo Coin’s 32nd presale phase is heating up, and it’s slipping away fast. While others chase the tailwinds of older meme tokens, a new frontrunner is inviting smart capital to act before the doors slam shut. This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Shiba Inu, and Baby Doge Coin. Weekly Token Burns? Arctic Pablo’s Deflation Engine Supercharges Long-Term Value Built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) introduces a rare feature that’s turning heads: an aggressive deflationary model. This isn’t just another hype-based meme coin; it’s designed with intelligent scarcity in mind. Every single week during its presale, unsold tokens are permanently removed from supply. Not later. Now. But what happens after the presale? Arctic Pablo Coin keeps burning. Any tokens left unallocated are automatically torched, fueling an ever-tightening supply, which may drive value skyward for holders. Isn’t that the dream? A shrinking supply often means rising demand, and that spells potential gains. Why is this important for long-term investors? Because scarcity = value. The fewer coins in circulation, the higher the likelihood of price appreciation, especially when demand is set to explode at launch. And every single burn is recorded transparently on the BSC chain. Could this be the blueprint for meme coin sustainability? With this deflationary setup, Arctic Pablo shines among the Top Meme Coins to Join for Long Term . Final Stretch: Arctic Pablo Coin’s $0.0005 Window May Never Return Time to talk numbers. Arctic Pablo Coin has officially reached its 32nd meme coin presale stage, Icebound Estates, and the numbers are jaw-dropping. At just $0.0005 per APC, early supporters are sitting on potential returns of 3,233.33 % if they had joined in earlier stages, and over 1,500% for those buying in today . Now picture this: A $1,000 investment today gets you 2,000,000 APC tokens. When APC lists at its target price of $0.008, that same investment turns into $16,000. And if projections hit $0.1, you’re looking at $200,000 — a staggering 19,900% ROI from the 32nd stage. Has any meme coin offered this kind of ROI in such a strategic, planned rollout? With over $3 million already raised, this isn’t just hype; it’s traction. Momentum is building like a glacier ready to avalanche. Once Icebound Estates closes, this price point will be a thing of the past. Can you really afford to miss the last best entry point? Arctic Pablo shines among the Top Meme Coins to Join for Long Term, and it’s not waiting around. Shiba Inu’s Layer 2 Evolution Fuels Fresh Momentum Shiba Inu continues to defy odds. Once dismissed as a joke, it’s now writing a new chapter through Shibarium, its Layer 2 blockchain. This upgrade improves scalability and reduces gas fees, positioning Shiba as more than just a meme; it’s becoming infrastructure. Developers are now building dApps within the Shiba ecosystem, driving real-world use cases and increasing investor confidence. While it’s not at its 2021 highs, the token’s resurgence and developer activity hint that Shiba Inu is far from done. For those still sitting on the fence, remember: lightning doesn’t strike the same place twice. Opportunity doesn’t knock forever; it slips away like sand through your fingers. Baby Doge’s Ecosystem Push Signals Big Moves Ahead Baby Dogecoin, known for its vibrant community, has taken serious steps to evolve beyond meme status. With updates to its DeFi ecosystem, including auto-burn mechanisms and liquidity enhancements, Baby Doge is experiencing a resurgence. It recently announced expansions into cross-chain bridges, enabling smoother transactions between BSC and Ethereum. These infrastructure enhancements show that Baby Doge isn’t just about cute branding; it’s planning to stay relevant in the long game. Could Baby Doge surprise everyone in the next bull run? Possibly. But as with any rocket, the best seats are already booked. Don’t let the train leave the station without you. It’s better to be early than regretfully late. Final Words: Three Contenders, One Clear Launchpad Shiba Inu is evolving. Baby Dogecoin is expanding. However, one project is currently inviting investors to the ground floor , and it’s making waves for the right reasons. With a transparent deflation model, massive ROI projections, and presale momentum that’s already topped $3 million, Arctic Pablo Coin offers an incredibly rare window of opportunity. For those who missed early Shiba or Baby Doge runs, this may be the second chance you’ve been hoping for. The clock is ticking on Icebound Estates, and so is the chance to turn small investments into legendary returns. Arctic Pablo shines among the Top Meme Coins to Join for Long Term,and right now, that shine has never been brighter. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs What makes Arctic Pablo Coin different from other meme coins? Arctic Pablo Coin introduces a weekly token burn mechanism, which drastically reduces the supply and boosts long-term value. How can investors buy Arctic Pablo Coin during the presale? Investors can join the presale directly on the project’s official site and secure tokens at just $0.0005 before the price rises. What’s the ROI potential of Arctic Pablo Coin from the 32nd stage? The current stage offers a potential return on investment (ROI) of up to 1,500%, with a projected peak ROI of $ 19,900. Is Arctic Pablo Coin built on a secure blockchain? Yes, all token burn events and transactions are transparently recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). How much has Arctic Pablo Coin raised in its presale so far? Over $3 million has already been raised, proving strong investor interest and market momentum. Article Summary Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is making headlines as it enters its 32nd phase, Icebound Estates, offering a unique deflationary model through weekly token burns. At just $0.0005 per token and an ROI potential of up to 19,900%, it’s attracting major investor interest. With $3 million already raised, Arctic Pablo shines among the Top Meme Coins to Join for Long Term. Shiba Inu and Baby Doge Coin continue to evolve, but Arctic Pablo’s transparent scarcity mechanics and presale momentum make it a rare find.

48564930,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=769484,1752971219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48564930.jpeg,Bitcoin on edge as UK considers selling seized $7.1B BTC stash,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/uk-eyes-7-1b-bitcoin-sale/,"The UK government could be about to embark on a huge Bitcoin stash sale, worth more than £5.4 billion ($7.1 billion). The stash consists of Bitcoin seized in 2018 as part of a police operation to take down a Chinese Ponzi scheme using Britain to hoard crypto assets among others.. The 61,000 Bitcoin seized at the time were worth a fraction of what they are now. However, with the value of Bitcoin skyrocketing, trading for more than $123,000 (£92,000) last week, the haul is now one of the biggest crypto seizures worldwide. Such a sell-off would occur at a crucial time for the UK economy. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is facing growing calls to fill a £20 billion fiscal hole. The country is struggling with stagnant growth, climbing borrowing costs, and stubborn inflation that is already raising concerns about keeping interest rates up longer. To make up the shortfall, ministers have signalled that they may have to increase taxes, a politically perilous gambit. At this moment, the windfall from seized Bitcoin is seen as an unorthodox but attractive solvent. The Home Office is developing proposals for a “cryptoasset holding and realization framework”, which would enable police to store and sell digital currencies such as Bitcoin securely. It would also allow for efficient handling, liquidation, and re-distribution of assets seized during investigations. It’s unclear how much cryptocurrency the UK government currently holds. However, the volume of digital assets seized by police forces across the country last year alone highlights a significant shift—digital currencies are now rivaling, and in some cases surpassing, traditional cash in scale and value. Treasury move rattles Bitcoin market News of the potential sale has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency community. Bitcoin, which has more than doubled in value since the start of the year, continues to climb, fueled not only by economic fundamentals but also by a growing sense of purpose and momentum in the market. The signing of the GENIUS Act in the US last week is a necessary milestone towards global crypto legitimacy. It opens the door to wider acceptance and reduces regulatory uncertainty for big players in the digital asset industry. Politicians, meanwhile, such as Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, have also been advocating for the UK to create a national pool of Bitcoin. Doing so, he says, would make the country financially independent and a global leader in the emerging digital economy. He has even floated this concept publicly — he called for a “crypto revolution” during a speech in Las Vegas in May. However, Labour has dismissed Farage’s plan, branding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as too unstable to keep such vital sovereign wealth in. Chancellor Reeves, in contrast, has concentrated on using Bitcoin proceeds to offset lost tax revenue, not to hedge against currency instability. The Treasury does not have a direct say on whether to dispose of confiscated crypto, but sources say the department is paying close attention to what happens. Any pushes here would greatly impact Bitcoin markets due to the size of the funds at play. Law enforcement drives crypto sale decisions While the potential windfall is a thrilling prospect for Treasury officials, law enforcement has the power to sell the Bitcoin. Seized digital assets are handled by bodies such as the National Crime Agency (NCA) and regional police forces. If the assets are unreturnable to crime victims, the proceeds are divided between the central government and law enforcement programs. In the 2018 confiscation, victims of the Chinese Ponzi scam demanded the return of their Bitcoins. Legal challenges could slow down or prevent any sale. However, if courts find that the victims cannot be traced or made whole, the state could be liquidated. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been central to contemporary financial crime, from scams and fraud to money laundering. As law enforcement has put more emphasis on tracking, freezing, and draining off these funds, focusing on what to do with these assets is becoming increasingly urgent in the new world of digitally induced crime.

48565091,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=769491,1752971407,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/48565091.jpeg,Risk-on fever hits junk bonds despite warnings from Jamie Dimon and others,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/risk-on-fever-junk-bonds-despite-warnings/,"Junk debt buyers in the U.S. are ignoring warnings from some of the biggest names on Wall Street and pouring money into the riskiest bonds on the market. CCC-rated bonds, the absolute bottom tier of speculative-grade credit, have returned 0.75% this month through Thursday, outperforming every other class, including investment-grade bonds, according to data from Bloomberg. At the same time, BB-rated bonds, which sit at the top of the junk heap, have delivered the worst performance of any speculative debt tier. That’s a major reversal from earlier in the year when fears over President Donald Trump’s trade policies made BBs the safer bet among junk names. But those concerns have faded fast. Stocks keep setting new highs, and investors clearly feel more comfortable stepping down the ladder to chase bigger yield. BB bonds lose ground as traders look elsewhere Robert Tipp, who serves as chief investment strategist at PGIM Fixed Income, said it directly: “As investors have become more comfortable, they’ve begun to reach for risk.” That comfort is showing up in a big way as market players drop BBs and scoop up CCCs without flinching. But Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, isn’t buying the hype. This week, he said credit spreads are “a little unnaturally low.” That comment came just one month after he said that if he were managing a fund, he wouldn’t be buying any credit at all. Over at DoubleLine Capital, Jeff Gundlach, the CEO, said last month that his firm has “its lowest ever allocation” to high-yield bonds. The reason? He doesn’t believe the valuations reflect the actual risk. There’s also a change happening in the other direction. More cautious buyers are pulling out of junk entirely and sliding up the scale to buy BBB investment-grade bonds. The yield gap between BB and BBB bonds has narrowed to just 75 basis points, way below the ten-year average of 120. That means investors don’t need to hang around BB territory to get a decent spread. There’s also a technical risk hitting BBs from another angle, the so-called “fallen angels.” These are companies that used to have investment-grade ratings but got bumped down into junk status. Warner Bros. Discovery is one recent case. Its planned split into two separate businesses triggered a downgrade and dumped billions of fresh debt into the BB market. Kelly Burton, managing director at Barings, said, “When big names come our way we need to determine how well these names can be digested and whether it will cause a technical dislocation.” New moves from banks and stressed companies shake the credit scene While junk buyers chase yield, U.S. banks are making strategic funding decisions after earnings season. JPMorgan Chase chose to go directly to the domestic investment-grade bonds market. But Wells Fargo and Citigroup took a different route. They went after European investors first, holding off on their U.S. bond sale. In China, real estate giant China Vanke is now trying to extend its domestic bank loans by up to ten years. That move is supposed to reduce pressure on its cash position, which has been under strain for months. Meanwhile in the U.S., CEC Entertainment, the company behind Chuck E. Cheese, is in talks with its equity investors for $600 million. The goal is to handle upcoming debt obligations after its attempt to raise funds through the junk bonds market failed. In Canada, Alimentation Couche-Tard just walked away from a ¥6.77 trillion ($45.8 billion) takeover bid for Seven & i Holdings. After nearly a year of pursuit, the Japanese company that runs 7-Eleven stores apparently refused to engage in serious talks, forcing Couche-Tard to step back. Back in Texas, LifeScan Global Corp., which makes glucose monitors and is backed by Platinum Equity, filed for bankruptcy protection. The company reached an agreement to hand over control to creditors in exchange for debt relief. Lastly, fiber-network provider Zayo Group Holdings is close to finalizing a deal with its creditors to extend the due dates on part of its multibillion-dollar debt pile. The agreement is still tentative, but it could give Zayo some breathing room in a tightening credit environment.

Even as Donald Trump threatens to slap a 30% tariff on imports and crank up global trade tensions, the European Central Bank decided Thursday it wouldn’t react just yet. They’re locking rates at 2% and postponing any cut in borrowing costs. The move comes right before their seven-week summer break, with policymakers clearly choosing to wait and see if Trump’s threats actually turn into pain before they make a move. The logic is simple: don’t rush. A lot of officials are about to disappear on holiday. They’d rather keep repeating that inflation is on target, park any panic until the next batch of economic projections is available for the September 10–11 meeting, and deal with it then. That means no new action now, but no denial either that things are getting ugly. The euro’s getting stronger, which is hitting exporters and dragging down inflation forecasts. France’s messy budget problems are adding more heat at the worst time. ECB watches data, ignores panic Behind closed doors, the ECB knows the pressure is building. A rate cut in September is clearly back on the table, even if they keep hiding behind the usual “meeting-by-meeting” line. President Christine Lagarde didn’t flinch in her statement Thursday, repeating that “risks to growth are tilted to the downside,” as flagged by Morgan Stanley economists in their preview titled Ready for the Beach . The coming week will pour in the data the ECB needs to weigh that risk. On Tuesday, their own bank lending survey drops. Wednesday follows with a consumer confidence report, and Thursday will deliver purchasing manager indexes from all across the region, conveniently right before policymakers log off. Germany’s Ifo business confidence and Italy’s economic sentiment numbers wrap the week up on Friday. Outside the euro area, more inflation data will fly in from Japan, Brazil, and others, while Bank of England chief Andrew Bailey will testify to UK lawmakers about financial stability.His appearance comes just as the UK drops public finance data on Tuesday and faces PMI figures and retail sales later in the week. Global markets brace as central banks diverge Over in the US, the economic calendar is light.A Wednesday housing report is expected to show barely any change in the sale of existing homes. Numbers have been flatlined near a 4 million annualized rate, just slightly better than the 2010 post-crisis low. Thursday brings a report that might show a modest bounce in new home sales, after a brutal drop in June.But the truth is the US housing market is still locked in place.High mortgage rates and unaffordable prices are keeping buyers out. Meanwhile, Canada’s economic mood gets measured through business and consumer surveys this week. They’ll give insight into inflation fears and investment trends. Retail sales data for May and June could also confirm that shoppers are retreating, especially after tariffs spiked car purchases earlier in the year. In Asia, everyone’s scrambling to make sense of global trade chaos. South Korea opens the week with export data, followed by confidence and retail numbers. China will keep loan prime rates steady for the second straight month. Over in Africa, South Africa will show June inflation is likely up to 3.1% from 2.8%, thanks to meat prices. In Nigeria, the central bank will likely keep rates frozen at 27.5%, for the third straight time, with inflation still hot at 22.2%. In Latin America, Argentina releases its May GDP-proxy Monday. April saw a 1.9% monthly jump and 7.7% year-over-year, helped by President Javier Milei’s move to loosen currency controls tied to a $20 billion IMF deal. Analysts now expect Argentina’s second-quarter GDP to grow 8%, and third quarter by 4.2%, according to Bloomberg. Mexico is under pressure too. The Tuesday GDP-proxy print will follow April’s surprise strength, and inflation eased in June, finally, and the central bank has hinted it may now slow its easing plans. Brazil will close the week with its mid-month inflation report, likely down for a third straight time, driven by sky-high borrowing costs. But expectations for 2025 inflation are still above target.

While the White House was stirring chaos over the Federal Reserve chair, Scott stepped in behind the scenes, sat down with Trump, and made one thing clear: firing Powell would be a mess. And not the fun, ratings-friendly kind Trump likes, this one would backfire. Badly. According to the Journal, Scott privately urged Trump to stay put, arguing that a high-profile showdown with the Fed chair, just ten months before Powell’s term ends, would do more harm than good. He laid out three points. First, markets were stable, reacting well to Trump’s policies. Second, the Fed was already signaling two possible rate cuts this year. And third, firing Powell could trigger legal hell and a political fight that Trump doesn’t need during an election cycle. Scott warned Trump about legal risks and GOP pushback Trump had been toying with the idea of firing Powell for months. His frustration with the Fed was no secret. The president kept complaining that Powell was dragging his feet on interest rate cuts, which Trump believes are needed to reduce federal debt expenses. But last week, it nearly escalated. A senior White House official told reporters that Trump had privately said he might go ahead and remove Powell. Hours later, Trump walked that back publicly, telling press he wasn’t planning to do so. But by then, the fire had already hit the markets. Investors got spooked. Even the idea that a president might remove a Fed chair over a policy disagreement was enough to rattle confidence. And Scott knew it. So did Wall Street. If Powell had been fired, the Fed’s independence would’ve been in serious doubt. The central bank has to make unpopular calls sometimes, and if its leader is seen as replaceable over policy differences, the whole structure begins to crumble. But Scott didn’t just talk markets. He warned Trump that Powell wouldn’t go quietly. “If you fire him now, he’ll sue,” Bessent told the president, according to one person briefed on the conversation. The lawsuit could last months, meaning Trump would get no benefit from the decision. Just headlines and headaches. And to be honest, he’s already getting a ton of that on his own anyway. It doesn’t stop there. Firing Powell could leave the Fed leaderless. The Senate would need to confirm a new chair, but in August, most lawmakers aren’t even in D.C. And even if they were, several Republican senators already made clear they oppose any attempt to remove Powell early. Senator John Thune told Fox News flat-out: “I think the markets want an independent Federal Reserve.” That kind of pushback could block any replacement Trump nominates. And don’t forget who takes over if Powell leaves. The vice chair. Right now, that’s Philip Jefferson, a Biden pick and Powell ally. So Trump wouldn’t just lose a fight; he’d hand the keys to someone even less aligned with him. All of this is what Scott hammered home. Other Trump officials want Powell out over office renovation costs While Scott played defense, others in Trump’s camp are still looking for a way to push Powell out. Budget director Russell Vought is leading that charge. He’s focused on a $2.5 billion office renovation project that the Fed is overseeing. The construction is behind schedule and over budget, and Vought is using that as ammo to build a case for “for cause” removal, a legal loophole that could sidestep the normal rules protecting Powell’s position. As part of that effort, Trump recently placed three of his allies, including someone reporting to Vought, on a D.C. planning commission. That commission approved the Fed’s design plans back in 2021. Now they’re circling back, demanding site visits, and threatening audits. Vought, when pressed, hasn’t denied that this could be a setup to boot Powell. But he’s been careful with his words, possibly to avoid drawing early legal challenges. Some advisers believe this construction saga could serve as grounds for firing Powell “for cause,” even though recent Supreme Court rulings have made that move harder to pull off. Meanwhile, the Fed chair succession game has already started. Scott said last week that Trump is likely to get one or two picks early next year. It had seem, at some point, that the Treasury chief wanted the job for himself. But if WSJ’s report is to be believed, it was Scott who saved the global economy.

48566973,https://thecoinrise.com/top-altcoins-to-know-in-2025-blockdag-cardano-doge-fetch-ai-and-what-sets-them-apart/,1752973224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/48566973.jpeg,"Top Altcoins to Know in 2025: BlockDAG, Cardano, DOGE, Fetch AI and What Sets Them Apart",https://thecoinrise.com/top-altcoins-to-know-in-2025-blockdag-cardano-doge-fetch-ai-and-what-sets-them-apart/,"The next major crypto wave isn’t being led by hype alone. It’s coming from platforms gaining ground through real-world use, strong tech, and steady communities. BlockDAG’s early-stage rise is showing how a presale can go viral without shortcuts. Dogecoin, once seen only as a joke, still holds public interest through its cultural force. Fetch AI is giving real shape to AI and blockchain working together. Cardano continues to show that research-based progress can still lead the way. Each project is different, offering a fresh take on what defines top altcoins in 2025. 1. BlockDAG’s Presale Momentum and Tech Stack Draw Attention BlockDAG’s growing presale crowd is speeding up. From online groups to public chats, more participants are securing BDAG coins with each batch before prices go higher. That growth isn’t by chance. The project’s 25% referral reward system has turned regular users into active promoters. This has helped build a large network of over 200,000 holders and 2 million mining BDAG through the popular X1 app. Behind this viral spread is a system doing real work. BlockDAG (BDAG) uses a Directed Acyclic Graph structure, which lets many blocks process at the same time. That means fewer hold-ups and smooth performance, even as traffic increases. Presale results show how fast interest is rising: $342 million raised and 24 billion coins sold. Mining gear sales have also crossed $7.9 million. Buyers are securing the $0.0016 price before August 11, ahead of the $0.05 listing and its 3025% return potential. This mix of demand and structure puts BlockDAG among the top altcoins gaining notice in 2025. 2. Fetch AI’s Role in Making AI Technology Useful and Decentralized Fetch AI is picking up pace as artificial intelligence finds more space in real-world systems. Priced near $0.72, FET supports a decentralized system where independent agents perform complex tasks, including smart mobility and supply chain tasks. This is not just theoretical, Fetch’s tools are already being tested in real pilot programs across different sectors. With a $1.72B market cap, there’s clear early belief in its direction. Many see FET as part of the next wave of AI-focused blockchain growth. Unlike many AI-linked projects, Fetch AI has a working system and rising use. Its combination of machine learning and blockchain makes it one of the top altcoins for those who believe AI will play a major role in the future of digital services and systems. 3. Dogecoin Keeps Its Position with Strong Community Support Dogecoin continues to hold its place in the market, outperforming most meme-based coins and staying in the top rankings by market size. While it started as a joke, DOGE has developed its own space in crypto, driven by social media energy and repeated mentions from Elon Musk. With a current price around $0.19, its ups and downs have calmed since the 2021 surge, but people still speculate on its next move. There’s also renewed interest in the idea of a Dogecoin ETF, with some expecting it could get approval by 2026. If it does, it may bring in broader attention. Even if past highs are not reached again, Dogecoin’s strong presence and loyal base keep it among the top altcoins for those focused on meme-driven appeal and cultural value. 4. Cardano Builds Quietly with Layer-1 Growth and DeFi Activity Cardano has always taken a slow and research-focused path, and that method is starting to show results. The recent Hydra upgrade improves its speed, while more DeFi projects are launching on the network. ADA trades at $0.71 and has a market cap of over $20 billion, showing it remains a major player. Some experts have also raised the possibility of a Cardano ETF, which could increase market interest. Price forecasts are mixed, with some pointing to a range of $3 to $5 by the end of 2025. What sets Cardano apart is its steady pace and science-backed development, rather than hype. That makes it one of the top altcoins for long-term support of Layer-1 networks with real progress. Final Thoughts on the Top Altcoins That Could Shape 2025 From Dogecoin’s meme-driven backing to Fetch AI’s real-world AI tools and Cardano’s detailed development, each of these top altcoins offers something unique. They are among the top altcoins worth tracking as the crypto space evolves. Still, one project is moving faster and more efficiently: BlockDAG. Its presale growth, use of DAG architecture, and clear pricing setup give it a different kind of momentum. While others depend on past success or slow growth, BlockDAG is gaining ground through fast action and a design built to scale. That’s what puts it on the list of 2025’s most talked-about altcoins.

The prominent altcoin is now facing major resistance at the $0.25 price level, the result of which bears significant implications for the current positive momentum. Popular market analyst Ali Martinez has weighed in on this situation, highlighting a chart pattern that favours a massive price breakout in the DOGE market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Prediction: Expect 60% Liftoff If This Channel Breaks: Analyst Double Bottom Formation Tips DOGE For 82% Rally In an X post on July 18, Ali Martinez presented a bullish technical analysis of the DOGE daily chart, hinting that the altcoin holds significant potential for a sustained rally in the short term. Martinez’s post shows that DOGE price movement over the six months has carved a textbook double bottom pattern, i.e., a technical setup that typically signals a positive trend reversal. The double bottom pattern is a classic bullish formation, featuring two roughly equal lows separated by a peak, i.e, the neckline in between. In the chart above, this pattern is noticed with DOGE forming lows near $0.13–$0.15 in April and June, separated by a rally toward $0.25 in May, representing the pattern’s neckline. Notably, the crypto market surge over the last month has pushed DOGE towards $0.24 again, thereby completing the W shape of the double bottom pattern. However, to validate the bullish potential of this chart pattern, market bulls must hold a decisive breakout above $0.25 resistance, which will typically be interpreted as a strong buy signal, projecting further gains ahead. This is a highly possible scenario as the steep recovery from the June lows shows increasing bullish momentum with buyers stepping in with higher volume, pushing price action upward in a nearly uninterrupted fashion. According to Ali Martinez, a successful clearance of the $0.25 neckline paves DOGE’s way for a rally to $0.42, hinting at a potential 82.3% gain on present market prices. On the other hand, another consecutive rejection around $0.25 price region would dent the current bullish momentum and possibly initiate a return to support levels around the $0.13–$0.15 region. Related Reading: Ethereum Road To $10,000: Replay Of May’s Playbook Predicts Another Breakout DOGE Price Overview At the time of writing, DOGE trades at $0.25 following a 7.84% increase in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is up by 108.5% suggesting suggesting a surge in market participation and growing bullish momentum, as traders continuously position themselves for a prolonged uptrend. With a market cap of $34.95 billion, DOGE retains its position as the ninth-largest cryptocurrency and largest memecoin in the world.
