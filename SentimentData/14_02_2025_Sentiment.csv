In a recent tweet, John Reed Stark, a former official at the SEC, claimed in this regard that the agency’s crypto enforcement division is now “dead and buried.” The SEC Crypto Unit is Now Unofficially Dead and Buried Per LinkedIn, the SEC’s “Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit,” is now the “Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit.” It won’t be long before the SEC’s website reflects the new name. Stick a fork in SEC crypto-enforcement, it’s done. pic.twitter.com/9JkywyZ30Q — John Reed Stark (@JohnReedStark) February 13, 2025 The SEC recently changed the name of the enforcement units related to cryptocurrencies on LinkedIn from “crypto assets” to “emerging technologies.” According to Stark , the move was initiated by the Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda to effectively disband crypto enforcement. Stark also further opined that the SEC would tone down on operations regarding cryptocurrencies. He said that the agency might withdraw or dismiss some of the already pending cases. The SEC paused its case against Binance for two months earlier this week adding to the belief of the dwindling enforcement activities. Currently, the SEC has not formally addressed the rebranding of the agency’s crypto enforcement unit. However, Stark opined that the agency’s website would soon change in the same regard. He stated, “It won’t be long before the SEC’s website reflects this new name. Perhaps the SEC will roll out the new name as some sort of feeble rebranding attempt.” SEC reevaluates crypto regulation strategy During a recent interview , commissioner Hester Peirce also acknowledged that the agency is reevaluating its approach to the crypto sphere. The SEC has often used enforcement actions to mediate the industry while recognizing that such measures are not conventional in policymaking. She insisted that they need rules and structure, not to pursue litigation-based regulation. “During the past several years, enforcement cases have been used as a way to make regulatory policy; that is very atypical,” Peirce stated. “We’re trying to get back to a path where we’re really using our other tools to make policy.” As noted by Stark, the SEC recently asked for a sixty-day stop to its ongoing legal case against Binance. In its defense, the agency stated the crypto task force would affect ongoing legal cases. The agency’s new direction may affect its former actions under the latest updated enforcement strategy. New task force and legal case reviews Peirce is currently leading the SEC’s crypto division, which focuses on creating a legal framework for the use of cryptocurrencies. The unit is tasked with determining which cryptocurrencies are securities and the SEC’s regulatory role in the market. The agency is also considering active litigation with leading crypto companies such as Binance, Ripple, and Coinbase. Peirce did not clarify whether there would be any dismissal of cases, but she said all would be decided on a case-by-case basis.“It’s facts and circumstances,” she said. “We’ll have to look at each case and its merits as we go forward.” Some cases have already experienced delays. In the SEC’s lawsuit against Lejilex, the two parties decided to postpone the oral arguments, which were initially planned for February 20th, increasing the decision duration to at least April 11, 2025. The uncertainty regarding cryptocurrency under the SEC has shifted alongside other regulatory policies under Trump’s presidency. After his Inauguration, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to create a panel that will consider how crypto is regulated. The government is also exploring the idea of creating a national crypto stockpile, which might influence the industry’s progress.

Despite a sharp rally to as high as $3.4, XRP has cooled down, now hovering around $2.50. While Ripple (XRP) still has the potential to rise again with factors like ETF hype, and regulatory changes in the U.S., the surrounding excitement has definitely cooled. At its current price of $2.47, Ripple (XRP) has already had its big moment. Now, the attention is shifting to a token with even more potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently priced at the lowest entry of $0.01, MUTM is attracting serious interest from crypto bulls. Having predictions pointing to a 100x gain to $1, it’s the kind of opportunity XRP investors can only dream of at this point. Unlike Ripple (XRP), which is riding out its post-rally phase, Mutuum Finance is still in the first phase of its presale, offering a fresh chance for massive returns. Additionally, its DeFi platform with features like Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending is drawing in investors looking for real utility. While XRP may have had its time in the spotlight, MUTM is where the real growth potential lies. Mutuum Finance: Revolutionizing Crypto Lending Mutuum Finance is reshaping the DeFi market with its innovative dual lending models. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system automates lending through smart contracts, enabling users to earn up to 10% APY while borrowing against ETH collateral without selling their holdings. Meanwhile, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model removes intermediaries, allowing lenders to set their own rates and terms for a more flexible and transparent lending experience. Investor demand is surging as the MUTM presale moves through its initial phase. With tokens priced at $0.01, over 620 investors have already contributed $420,000, and the price is set to climb to $0.06 at launch, offering an impressive 600% gain before reaching major exchanges. Market analysts anticipate an even greater upside, with projections pointing toward a potential $1 target post-listing, making this a preferable early investment. Mutuum Finance is preparing to launch a collateral-backed stablecoin, designed to enhance financial stability and platform liquidity. Additionally, the introduction of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) will grant token holders governance rights, ensuring a transparent, community-driven future for the project. To reward its growing community, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway. Ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, making this an exciting incentive for early adopters. How To Buy MUTM Tokens Here is a simple process on how to buy MUTM tokens Set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet with crypto funds. Go to the Mutuum Finance presale page. Select your investment amount. Confirm the transaction. Receive your MUTM tokens, which can be claimed after the presale ends. While Ripple (XRP) already had its moment in the spotlight, the focus is now shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a promising altcoin that offers crypto bulls the opportunity to capitalize on its early-stage growth. The potential for substantial returns is undeniable With a presale price of just $0.01. Market analysts are projecting a 100x gain, with the price possibly reaching $1. Mutuum Finance’s innovative DeFi lending models and upcoming ecosystem expansions, including a USD-pegged stablecoin and a projected DAO, make it a project worth watching closely. Don’t miss out on this early opportunity, invest in MUTM now to be part of the next big thing in crypto.

However, the burning question is whether the price can rally past the $0.05 mark or whether a new underdog altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , will overshadow it as its $0.0420 presale explodes. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Underdog Altcoin Presale Set To Explode Experts remain sure of a $0.10 target for the Shiba Inu price, but WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents something fresh and auspicious. The underdog altcoin is selling at $0.0420 in presale, giving investors a rare opportunity to get in early before it explodes. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform brings a whole new level of utility to the crypto market with features that will make it a household name in the coming months. The platform will soon launch its beta version , while its MVP build introduces a Scan and Pay QR code system for wallet addresses, eliminating the need to input addresses manually. Moreover, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers incredible incentives for presale investors. Those who buy into the presale early can stake their tokens to earn an annual percentage yield (APY) of up to 180%, along with governance rights and discounted transaction fees. Through its referral program, WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale investors can earn bonuses in native tokens by inviting others to join the ecosystem. The underdog altcoin presale incentivizes current investors, creating a network effect that could drive up the altcoin’s value in the long run. WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale investors will always have the proper asset allocation for maximum profitability, as the crypto wallet’s predictive algorithms automatically rebalance portfolios based on market trends. Investors have been waiting for this level of automation and precision, and it is now available through the underdog altcoin’s presale. The SolidProof audit of WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) smart contract affirms that the platform is free from vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of malicious attacks or scams. The underdog altcoin presale presents a much more secure, utility-driven path to profitability, with the bonus of incredibly low presale prices. Shiba Inu Price: A $0.10 Target Still Possible, But Can It Rally Past $0.05? The Shiba Inu (SHIB) current price of $0.00001522 makes experts cautiously optimistic about its potential. While they agree that a $0.10 target is still possible, the path to that milestone isn’t smooth. Reaching $0.10 would require a staggering surge of over 500,000%, an incredibly challenging feat. Even hitting $0.05 is no small task, given the current market conditions The Shiba Inu price recently dropped to a six-month low of $0.00001160, only to recover slightly before falling again. Despite these challenges, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community remains hopeful, with some experts pointing to its 13% rise in January as a sign of underlying strength. However, as the market becomes more competitive, questions arise: Can the Shiba Inu price rally past $0.05? The token’s market cap is still modest, but at $0.10, Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) market cap would skyrocket to a staggering $58.87 trillion. However, with the ongoing challenges and fierce competition from newer projects, it’s unclear whether the Shiba Inu price will see such a dramatic rise. Conclusion: Make Your Move To The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Altcoin Presale Now The Shiba Inu price forecast may hold hope for some experts, with a $0.10 target still in sight. Still, the real opportunity lies in the underdog altcoin WallitIQ (WLTQ) . With its unique AI-powered platform , staking rewards, and presale bonuses, the altcoin offers investors a chance to get in early and potentially see massive returns. While the Shiba Inu price forecast suggests that the $0.10 target could still be achievable, it’s far from guaranteed, requiring a monumental effort to surpass $0.05. However, like any opportunity, the window for maximum profits with the WallitIQ (WLTQ) underdog altcoin presale won’t stay open forever. Experts say investors should quickly take advantage of the altcoin’s unique high-yield utilities and potential. Buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) early during the $0.0420 presale and benefit from the potential to grow your investment exponentially as the underdog altcoin explodes.

The platform even plans to reward its loyal users with free $SEA tokens, though it has yet to reveal any further details. Devin Finzer, Co-founder and CEO of OpenSea, remarked : This represents an expansion of OpenSea from an NFT marketplace to a much broader platform for trading all types of cryptos. We think tokens and NFTs belong together in a single, powerful, delightful experience. Devin Finzer OpenSea will distribute SEA tokens to reward its users OpenSea’s new OS trading platform will support cross-chain token purchases and initially offer lower fees for its users. Moreover, OpenSea Foundation, a Cayman Islands-based institution, promised to distribute $SEA tokens to reward and engage NFT users and offer utility on the OS2 platform. The foundation has yet to specify when it will start distributing tokens or even how many tokens will go to its users. The company, however, confirmed that its planned airdrop will cover both active users and the platform’s first users. US users will also be eligible for the airdrop. Additionally, the company insists that SEA’s utility is meant to be long-term rather than short-lived speculation. It even posted on X the several advantages OS2 has to offer, including how consumers can now access NFTs and crypto tokens on the same platform and how the utility has 14 new chains, including ApeChain and BSL. Hu believes their new platform and token will help grow community support for NFTs Fizner argued that beta testers put emphasis on building speed, reliability, and quality of its new utility, saying the OS2 feels right. Additionally, James Hu, the general manager of the OpenSea Foundation, says that OS2 should help the community grow and improve the OpenSea ecosystem. He further states that the presence of the $SEA token will increase the incentive for community members to get involved and support the NFT ecosystem. So far, OpenSea’s annualized revenues are at $33 million after facilitating the trading of $190 million worth of NFTs in the previous month. However, its trading volume has dipped from its record highs in 2021.

This sharp decline has left investors on edge, fueling fear and uncertainty as Avalanche mirrors the bearish trends seen across the broader crypto market. Doubts about AVAX’s potential to recover and generate significant gains have started to dominate market sentiment, leaving many questioning whether a rebound is possible in the near term. Related Reading: Cardano Could Move Up To $0.83 If Momentum Holds – Can ADA Sustain A Breakout? However, amidst this uncertainty, there are signs that Avalanche may be preparing for a turnaround. According to key metrics shared by top analyst Ali Martinez, Avalanche is showing promising signs of a potential rebound. Martinez highlights that a key technical indicator has flashed a buy signal on the weekly chart, offering a glimmer of hope for a recovery rally. This signal suggests that AVAX might be nearing a bottom, and if market conditions align, it could mark the beginning of a new bullish phase. As the market remains volatile, all eyes are on Avalanche to see if this buy signal can translate into sustained upward momentum. Investors are cautiously optimistic, hoping that AVAX can overcome current challenges and reclaim its bullish potential. Avalanche Indicator Signals A Potential Trend Reversal Avalanche (AVAX) has been stuck in a state of indecision as bulls fail to reclaim the $27 mark, while bears struggle to push the price further down. This tug-of-war reflects the broader uncertainty in the crypto market, leaving Avalanche at a critical juncture. Analysts are divided on the next move for AVAX, with some predicting a massive recovery rally while others anticipate a continuation of the bearish trend that has gripped the market since mid-December. Top analyst Ali Martinez has added to the discussion by sharing a technical analysis on X that reveals promising signs for Avalanche. Martinez highlights that the TD Sequential indicator, a widely used tool for identifying trend exhaustion and potential price reversals, has flashed a buy signal on the weekly chart. This is significant, as weekly signals carry more weight and often suggest the possibility of long-term reversals. If bulls capitalize on this signal and push the price above the $27 resistance level, it could trigger a broader recovery phase. On the flip side, failure to hold current levels may lead to further consolidation or downside movement as bears attempt to regain control. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Have Bought Over 600,000 ETH In The Past Week – Time For A Price Upswing? The coming days and weeks will be crucial for Avalanche, as the price action will either validate the bullish signal or reinforce the prevailing bearish sentiment. Investors are closely monitoring the $27 level and the implications of the TD Sequential signal, as it could mark the beginning of a long-awaited recovery rally for AVAX. AVAX Price Consolidates Between Key Levels Avalanche (AVAX) is trading at $25.6 after several days of indecision and consolidation within a narrow range, stuck below the $27 resistance level and above the $23 support zone. This tight range reflects the ongoing uncertainty in the broader market as bulls and bears battle for control. Bulls face a crucial test at current levels. They need to hold the $25 support zone and build momentum to push AVAX above the key $28.7 resistance level. Breaking and reclaiming this mark as support would confirm a trend reversal, signaling the start of a potential recovery rally. A successful breakout above $28.7 could attract more buyers and lead to a move into higher price levels. However, selling pressure remains a significant risk for AVAX. If the price loses the $23 support level, the bearish trend that has dominated since mid-December could continue. A breakdown below this range would likely take AVAX into lower demand zones, with $20 being the next critical support level.

Cardano has just implemented the Plomin hard fork, transitioning to full decentralized governance and empowering ADA holders with voting rights on critical matters. At the same time, DOGE is drawing attention with substantial whale buys—750 million tokens recently—and its addition to a new Grayscale trust fuels discussions on its future potential. As ADA and DOGE advance their ecosystems, Web3Bay is transforming the e-commerce landscape. Unlike traditional models like Amazon, which dictates fees and policies, Web3Bay operates as a web3 crypto marketplace where community members set the rules. Smart contracts eliminate intermediaries, staking rewards consumers, and DAO governance gives control back to the users. As the sphere of crypto shopping grows, Web3Bay is at the forefront. Web3Bay Revolutionizes E-Commerce: $1.17M Presale & a New Era of Blockchain Marketplace Amazon may dominate with strict control over pricing, fees, and policies, but Web3Bay is turning things around. This web3 crypto marketplace empowers its users with decentralized governance, allowing buyers and sellers to set their own transaction terms independently. Smart contracts take over where third-party systems left off, promoting trustless, transparent dealings. Users benefit from reduced fees and direct earnings, marking a significant shift from traditional e-commerce platforms that profit at the merchants’ expense. Web3Bay is not just an idea—it’s a thriving marketplace with a presale already topping $1.17 million. More than 300 million 3BAY tokens have been sold at a current price of $0.004562625. With its DAO structure, Web3Bay enables community voting on important updates and policies. The platform not only offers a place to trade but also rewards buyers through staking options that provide passive income during transactions. Early participants in Web3Bay may find significant long-term advantages as the platform grows. As more people adopt cryptocurrencies, Web3Bay is poised to become the preferred decentralized shopping destination. With the rising interest in Cardano’s ADA and a growing focus on decentralization across various sectors, Web3Bay is leveraging these principles to redefine online shopping, benefiting users over corporations. The landscape of e-commerce is evolving, and Web3Bay is leading the change. ADA Price Outlook: Major Upgrades Propel Cardano Forward Cardano’s recent Plomin hard fork marks a significant leap towards complete decentralization. This update grants ADA holders the ability to vote on protocol changes and treasury allocations. As a result, Cardano edges closer to a fully community-driven blockchain, solidifying its presence in the cryptocurrency world. With a focus on decentralized governance, Cardano is showcasing its dedication to lasting sustainability and ongoing innovation. Currently, the ADA price hovers around $0.71, supported strongly by technical indicators at crucial levels. Moreover, institutional interest is climbing—Swedish company Virtune has just introduced a staked Cardano ETP on Nasdaq Helsinki, providing 2% staking rewards. As Cardano evolves, its drive towards decentralization and growing real-world use could spur further increases. DOGE Crypto Builds Momentum as Whales Increase Holdings Big investors are actively acquiring 750 million DOGE crypto amid recent price lows, indicating a robust confidence in Dogecoin’s prospects, particularly as it attracts more institutional players. The introduction of Grayscale’s Dogecoin Trust offers investors a formal avenue to engage with DOGE, enhancing its legitimacy and stirring more speculation on its broader acceptance. DOGE is trading at approximately $0.2493, maintaining a stable trajectory despite market oscillations. With ADA also capturing interest following Cardano’s updates, both meme coins and utility-centric tokens are drawing attention. As Dogecoin widens its footprint in mainstream finance, backed by a strong community and enhanced adoption, it is poised to maintain its growth. A Closer Look Cardano’s transition to fully decentralized governance represents a pivotal change, placing more power into the community’s hands. With the ADA price remaining robust and new institutional-grade staked ETPs emerging, Cardano’s outlook is bright. Concurrently, DOGE crypto witnesses substantial whale interest, and its integration into Grayscale’s trust lends it additional authenticity. As these cryptocurrencies enhance their ecosystems, Web3Bay challenges conventional e-commerce practices. Unlike Amazon, this web3 crypto marketplace empowers buyers and sellers to dictate terms, cuts out intermediaries, and lowers costs.

However, data shows a longer timeframe for this to be achieved. Meanwhile, savvy investors are turning their attention to a new horizon, with one expert spotlighting PropiChain (PCHAIN) , an AI altcoin, as a potential game-changer, forecasting gains that could reach a staggering 40,000%. Shiba Inu Price Faces Pressure as Whale Exodus Raises Concerns The recent decline in Shiba Inu whale activity is raising red flags for investors, as large transactions have plummeted by 85%, indicating a significant shift in market behavior. Historically, whales play a crucial role in maintaining liquidity and influencing the Shiba Inu price action, but with inflows dropping by over 91% and major holders offloading 1.13 trillion SHIB in a single day, the market is seeing increased volatility. This exodus coincides with the Shiba Inu price decline from its November high of $0.000033 to the current $0.000016 level, suggesting waning confidence among large holders. While SHIB’s RSI at 37.38 signals that it is approaching oversold territory, resistance at $0.000018 remains a major hurdle. Without renewed accumulation, further downside pressure could push the Shiba Inu price toward the $0.000015 support zone. PropiChain (PCHAIN): The AI-Powered Altcoin Set to Improve Real Estate Investing The global real estate sector, valued at over $300 trillion, has long struggled with inefficiencies, fraud, and restricted access. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is transforming the industry, using blockchain and AI to eliminate these issues while rivaling the Shiba Inu price movement. One of its key features is its ability to fractionalize high-value properties, a game-changer in an industry traditionally dominated by those who can afford entire properties. With PropiChain, investors can acquire fractions of prime real estate assets, allowing for greater diversification and improved liquidity in a sector notorious for being illiquid. Beyond ownership, the platform provides an easy exit strategy for investors, allowing them to trade their tokens in a seamless marketplace. This eliminates the delays and complexity associated with conventional real estate transactions, enhancing liquidity for both individual and institutional players. PropiChain’s AI integration further elevates its impact by leveraging predictive analytics. The platform provides real-time, data-driven insights into property valuation, market trends, and investment opportunities. PCHAIN’s AI and ML algorithms analyze historical sales data and economic indicators to generate accurate property valuations, ensuring smarter investment decisions. Transactions are also automated through AI-driven smart contracts, allowing investors to set predefined conditions, such as purchasing a property once a specific price is met. This automation optimizes market conditions, reduces errors, and streamlines the transaction process. Security remains a top priority for PropiChain, with its decentralized ledger, “Title Contract,” ensuring transparency in all transactions. Each property transfer, lease agreement, and financial transaction is recorded immutably on the blockchain, preventing fraud and providing a verifiable ownership history. PCHAIN has completed an in-depth smart contract audit conducted by BlockAudit , a highly reputable blockchain security firm known for its rigorous audits. The audit assessed PropiChain’s smart contracts for vulnerabilities, ensuring that the platform’s code is secure, resistant to exploits, and operates as intended. PropiChain’s official listing on CoinMarketCap provides further transparency, allowing investors to track real-time market data, liquidity, and trading volume. PropiChain’s ambitions extend beyond traditional real estate, positioning itself as a leader in metaverse property assessment. The platform seamlessly integrates with virtual real estate markets, offering users opportunities to explore and invest in digital properties within the Propiverse. Investors can take 3D virtual property tours, interact with assets, and acquire metaverse-backed real estate, creating new investment avenues while enhancing user experience. This expansion into digital real estate allows global investors to evaluate properties remotely, redefining accessibility. PropiChain’s Token Presale: A Gateway to High Returns The PropiChain token presale has already generated significant interest, exceeding initial fundraising goals. The first phase saw over $2.9 million raised, with tokens initially priced at $0.004 each. Currently in its second stage, PCHAIN is available at $0.011 per token, with prices expected to rise to $0.023 in the final presale stage before its official listing at $0.032. This progressive increase reflects the growing investor demand and confidence in the project. Early investors stand to benefit the most, with projections indicating a potential 40,000% ROI by Q1 2025. A $1,000 investment at presale prices could see exponential growth, potentially reaching $400,000 upon public release, mirroring the price movement of Shiba Inu during its 2021 surge. As the presale advances, opportunities to acquire PCHAIN tokens at these favorable rates become increasingly limited. Interested investors can participate by registering on the official PropiChain website, selecting their investment amount, and completing their purchase through supported payment methods. Join now.

According to a new Robinhood investment report , the trading app giant saw a 200% year-over-year increase in transaction-based revenues, largely due to crypto. “Total net revenues increased 115% year-over-year to $1.01 billion. Transaction-based revenues increased over 200% year-over-year to $672 million, primarily driven by cryptocurrencies revenue of $358 million, up over 700%, options revenue of $222 million, up 83%, and equities revenue of $61 million, up 144%. Net interest revenues increased 25% year-over-year to $296 million, primarily driven by growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by a lower federal funds rate. Other revenues increased 31% year-over-year to $46 million, primarily due to increased Gold subscription revenues.” Source: Reuters According to a Reuters report , Robinhood’s latest advance into crypto solidifies the trading app as a top rival for the leading US-based crypto exchange Coinbase. Says Paul Marino, Chief Revenue Officer at Themes ETFs (exchange-traded funds), of Robinhood’s success. “The fact that Robinhood had such a surge in revenues across its entire platform is more than just an appetite for risk in the marketplace – it’s also a testament to the adoption of its platform and the fact that the next generation of traders prefer what Robinhood is offering versus competitors.” Coinbase is on schedule to release its own quarterly earnings report later today.

Hyperliquid was last changing hands around $26 per coin, up nearly 9x since its late-November launch. Over the same time period, ETH is down around 25% and Solana is down around 20%. HYPE is the native token of HyperEVM, the innovative layer-1 blockchain that now underpins the Hyperliquid trading protocol. Whilst some are surprised by HYPE’s resilience despite the struggles of the broader crypto market, they shouldn’t be. Really is absurd how immune Hyperliquid is to any market volatility or bleed. $HYPE pic.twitter.com/pS4pMncQRd — McKenna (@Crypto_McKenna) February 13, 2025 Since launching its layer-1 blockchain, Hyperliquid has seen a surge of adoption and usage. Per Messari, Hyperliquid’s trading volumes have surged more than 4x. Hyperliquid’s monthly trading volumes up more than 4x since October Hyperliquid. pic.twitter.com/dFDPqet2lf — Messari (@MessariCrypto) February 7, 2025 HYPE was also the largest crypto airdrop in history and the coin has gained widespread praise for its community (rather than VC) first allocation. One analyst on X noted that HYPE is allocated 69.9% to the community, compared to an average of 36.1% for other networks. Hyperliquid allocated 69.9% of supply to the community, compared to an average of 36.1% for other networks. pic.twitter.com/maVy6fkOOm — Nick G (@NickDGarcia) February 12, 2025 A community-first allocation has likely directly contributed to Hyperliquid’s ground-up adoption, and its growth prospects moving forward look good. Where Next for Hyperliquid? As HYPE crawls higher to probe for a retest of its late-January highs, traders are wondering where the crypto might be headed next. HYPE continues to trade to the north of key short-term moving averages and in a modest uptrend. Macro tailwinds ( such as this week’s hot US inflation data ) continue to keep the broader market in check, but the Hyperliquid price could very well test $28 soon and mount a renewed push toward record high above $35. However, its next major surge may have to wait until broader alt-coin market conditions improve. Tight US financial conditions (US 10-year yields remain elevated around 4.5%) suggest a massive surge like that of 2017 or 2021 is unlikely this year. However, financial conditions aside, there are a lot of bullish events happening for crypto right now as the Trump administration implements its pro-crypto policies. A bitcoin strategic reserve could be coming, as well as a swathe of pro-crypto market legislation that could inject massive liquidity and demand into the space. And as an already established leader, the Hyperliquid price could be set to surge. Its fully diluted valuation of just under $26 billion suggests plenty of room for further upside in the coming years, even if 2025 is a bit of a grind. Could Hyperliquid Overtake Solana? Recent price outperformance has some analysts wondering whether HYPE might someday be able to overtake Solana. After all, the main Solana use case has been for (meme coin) trading, and Hyperliquid is arguably a far superior trading platform. However, while HYPE has shown promising growth with its innovative approach to blockchain technology and community engagement, it still lacks the established developer ecosystem and institutional support that Solana enjoys. Furthermore, even though HYPE might capture significant market interest, Solana’s lead in transaction speed, lower costs, and existing network effects create a high barrier for HYPE to surpass it in market dominance. Best Wallet – A Better Alternative to Consider? Hyperliquid has massive upside potential in the years ahead, but for those looking for even faster gains, and exciting new project called Best Wallet (BEST) could be an even better bet. With over $9 million already raised in just a few months, Best Wallet’s presale is off to a flying start. That strong momentum should come as no surprise given that Best Wallet non-custodial wallet has already amassed over 250,000 users. 250K+ traders are locking in their edge with Best Wallet.

Qubetics’ presale is approaching $13M, proving it’s one of the hottest crypto investments right now with its AI-powered Web3 ecosystem and potential 13525% ROI. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is eyeing a breakout past $300, as its developer adoption and NFT ecosystem continue to expand. And let’s not forget Algorand (ALGO), which just launched a real-time staking model, shaking up the passive income game for investors. With Qubetics’ presale stages closing fast, Solana’s price gaining momentum, and Algorand’s staking innovation attracting attention, these cryptos are positioning themselves for short-term gains and long-term growth. But which one should you bet on? Let’s dive in. Qubetics: The Web3 Aggregator Changing the Game with a Decentralized VPN Qubetics is not just another blockchain project—it’s a Web3 aggregation powerhouse that unifies multiple networks under a single, interoperable ecosystem. One of its most revolutionary applications is its Decentralized VPN (dVPN) , a privacy-focused, censorship-resistant alternative to traditional VPNs. Right now, millions rely on centralized VPN providers like NordVPN and ExpressVPN for online privacy. But here’s the issue: these companies control user data, and in many cases, they’re legally required to hand over browsing activity to governments. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN flips the script by offering a peer-to-peer, blockchain-based solution that: Eliminates centralized control, meaning no one entity can track, censor, or restrict your access. Uses a tokenized bandwidth-sharing system, rewarding users who share their unused bandwidth with TICS tokens. Protects against surveillance and censorship, making it ideal for users in regions with restricted internet access. For example, imagine a journalist in China trying to bypass the Great Firewall. Traditional VPNs are often blocked, but Qubetics’ dVPN operates on a decentralized network, making it nearly impossible to shut down. The same applies to crypto traders in restrictive countries, who need secure, anonymous internet access. With data privacy becoming a global concern, Qubetics’ dVPN is positioned to disrupt the $44B VPN market, making TICS one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term and long-term gains. Qubetics Presale: The Clock is Ticking on This 100x Opportunity! Let’s talk numbers—because Qubetics’ presale isn’t just growing, it’s exploding: Presale Raised: $12.6M+ Current Price: $0.0733 per TICS Total Coins Sold: 470M+ Holders: 19,700+ And here’s the kicker: each presale stage lasts just 7 days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at 12 AM. Now, let’s get real about potential returns. A $1,000 investment at the start of the presale would already be worth $3,406 today. But post-mainnet launch, the gains could be life-changing: $TICS at $1 → 1,262.56% ROI $TICS at $10 → 13,525.66% ROI $TICS at $15 → 20,338.49% ROI With Qubetics’ mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025, time is running out to join the Qubetics presale before the next price increase. Solana: The Blockchain Powerhouse Gearing Up for a $300 Breakout Solana (SOL) has been one of the best-performing altcoins in the past year, and now, it’s flirting with the $300 resistance level. According to Solana Labs, the network has seen a massive influx of developer activity, leading some analysts to believe that Solana could eventually become a trillion-dollar asset. One of Solana’s biggest advantages is its high-speed, low-cost transactions. While Ethereum struggles with high gas fees, Solana offers an alternative that can process thousands of transactions per second for just a few cents. The recent surge in Solana’s ecosystem can be attributed to: Growing adoption of Solana-based NFTs Institutional investors showing renewed interest in SOL Upcoming protocol upgrades to enhance network efficiency With Solana eyeing a potential breakout past $300, it’s one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term gains, especially if the market continues its bullish momentum. Algorand: Revolutionizing Passive Income with Real-Time Staking While most blockchains require users to lock up their assets for months to earn staking rewards, Algorand (ALGO) is flipping the script with its real-time staking model. This innovation allows users to earn passive income instantly, without waiting for staking periods to end. Algorand’s new staking system has several key benefits: Instant payouts, allowing users to earn rewards without delays. No lock-up periods, meaning you can stake and unstake at any time. More flexibility for traders, who can earn rewards while still being able to move funds around. With this groundbreaking staking mechanism, Algorand is attracting a new wave of investors looking for secure, high-yield passive income options. And with staking being a major driver of token adoption, ALGO’s price could see short-term gains as demand increases. Final Thoughts: Which Altcoin Offers the Best Short-Term Gains? With so many hot crypto investments right now, here’s how things stack up: Qubetics (TICS) is the top pick for short-term and long-term growth, with its $13M presale, decentralized VPN, and massive 100x potential. Solana (SOL) is approaching a critical breakout level at $300, making it a strong play for traders looking for quick gains. Algorand (ALGO) is revolutionizing staking rewards, attracting new investors looking for passive income opportunities. If you’re looking for the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term , Qubetics is the standout. With presale prices increasing weekly and the mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, now is the time to join the Qubetics presale before the next price hike. Are you in?

40296412,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=674117,1739488527,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40296412.jpeg,Deutsche Bank-Backed Taurus unveils Solana-based tokenization platform for institutional clients,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/taurus-unveils-solana-based-tokenization/,"Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest financial institution, has partnered with Swiss crypto company Taurus and launched a Solana-based TDX marketplace. The platform is licensed to hold, manage, and stake cryptocurrencies as well as tokenized financial assets for banks, financial institutions, and enterprises. Deutsche Bank’s alliance with Taurus was part of a $65 million Series B funding round, to which key players such as Credit Suisse, Arab Bank Switzerland, and Pictet Group contributed significantly. Taurus integrates Solana for RWA tokenization Jurgen Hofbauer, head of global strategic partnerships at Taurus, noted that the integration between Taurus and Solana stemmed from the demand for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization solutions. He said that the partnership would allow banking and enterprise clients to tokenize their assets, such as equity, debt, funds, CBDCs, structured products, and tokenized deposits at lower costs and simpler processes. Taurus provides enterprise-grade infrastructure to issue cryptocurrency, manage custody, and trade tokenized assets, cryptos, and NFTs. Deutsche Bank has shown interest in crypto for years, and in June 2023, they took a bold step by applying for a digital asset custody license from Germany’s financial regulatory body, BaFin. Alongside institutional clients, retail users can create an account with Taurus and actively participate in capital raises. They can also securely trade digital assets and tokenized securities in compliance with company regulations. Taurus stated that companies can now access primary and secondary markets that serve both retail and professional investors and improve the liquidity of their digital securities. They can also develop their very own trading segments and custom liquidity through auction-based trading. Taurus entices new issuers searching for a trading venue Taurus released a list of new issuers opting for its service as a preferred platform for trading their digital securities. Some popular names include Investis Group, Qoqa, Teylor, Swissroc, la Mobiliere, and SCCF. TDX Head of Product Yann Isola said that Taurus thinks that private markets 2.0 will be digitalized, making a huge difference in buying private security. He is sure that his assumptions are correct, as the demand for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is also the fastest-growing market for digital assets. Meanwhile, Solana has been gaining momentum in the RWA sector, attracting high-profile institutions that are looking to bring traditional financial products on-chain. Franklin Templeton, a leading global asset manager, brought its $594 million Government Money Market Fund (FOBXX) to Solana just yesterday.

40297374,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=674272,1739488855,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40297374.jpeg,Baidu to offer Ernie Bot for free amid DeepSeek challenge,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/baidu-to-offer-ernie-bot-for-free/,"Chinese tech firm Baidu said it would offer access to its flagship artificial intelligence chatbot, Ernie Bot, for free starting April 1. The chatbot, first released just a few months after OpenAI’s ChatGPT, will be available for free to all users across mobile and desktop platforms, the company announced on Thursday, as reported by Reuters . Baidu cited reduced costs and improved technology Baidu said the decision to offer Ernie Bot for free is due to reductions in “inference costs” – basically the costs involved in training large language models (LLMs), including computing power, data storage, and energy use. The Beijing-based company also announced that a new “Deep Search” function, with “enhanced capabilities in thinking, planning, and tool calling” will also be released for free on April 1. After the news, shares of Baidu rose as much as 5.7% in Hong Kong trading on Thursday, according to Google Finance. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has reached a high of HK$119 and low of HK$74. Per Baidu’s data, Ernie Bot had reached a user base of around 430 million users as of November 2024. The chatbot was an early leader in China’s AI industry but it is now facing increasing competition from cheaper and more advanced rivals such as DeepSeek, which provides free AI chatbot services. The Chinese startup recently dropped new models and also claimed the superiority of its models in a technical report. DeepSeek said its model outclassed rivals from OpenAI and Stability AI on rankings for image generation using text prompts. On Wednesday, The Information reported that Baidu was failing to meet Apple’s standards to bring AI to Chinese iPhones. The iPhone maker was reportedly considering working with other firms like Alibaba, it said. And then on Thursday, Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai confirmed during a conference in Dubai that the e-commerce giant is working with Apple. Baidu faces stiff competition Baidu was one of China’s first tech firms to delve deep into the AI sector after OpenAI released its ChatGPT in November 2022. Released in March 2023 , Baidu’s Ernie Bot was up until last month seen as the closest rival to ChatGPT. Baidu has reportedly claimed that its latest version Ernie 4.0 matches OpenAI’s GPT-4 capabilities. However, it has not been rosy for Baidu. According to Asia Financial , one of the tech giant’s biggest challenges has been to achieve widespread adoption in China for the chatbot, although it reportedly handled 1.5 billion daily user queries and interactions. Data from AI product tracker Aicpb.com shows that in terms of user adoption, Baidu’s offerings have been lagging behind domestic competitors like ByteDance’s Doubao chatbot and the latest competitor DeepSeek. According to Asia Financial, the search engine giant’s problems also reflect the intense rivalry within the AI sector in China. The world witnessed a price war last year as the firm and its key competitors Alibaba and ByteDance significantly cut prices of LLMs they use to support generative AI products. Baidu made its Ernie Speed and Ernie Lite free for all business users at that time. In November last year, Baidu revealed that it was shifting its focus to the commercialization of LLM applications. One of its products I-RAG is a text-to-image technology that uses Baidu’s search capabilities to tackle the AI “hallucination” problems. The company also announced the launch of Miaoda, a tool that utilizes its LLM capabilities to generate code and allow users to develop software applications without extensive coding expertise. According to a CNBC report earlier this week, Baidu revealed it is also planning to introduce the next iteration of Ernie Bot in the second half of this year. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the report further indicates that the latest model, Ernie 5, will feature multimodal capabilities which allow it to process and convert between different formats including text, images, audio, and videos.

The buybacks will start from Monday, February 17, and will aim to build a JUP reserve for additional incentives. JUP tokens may get support from the first buybacks, starting Monday, February 17. The Jupiter DEX will use the proceeds from trading fees to build a JUP treasury, which will be locked for three years, per the announcement . we want more more jup. so buybacks start on monday. 50% of all protocol fees will go towards buying $JUP and locking it for 3 years. J4J — Jupiter (🐱, 🐐) (@JupiterExchange) February 13, 2025 The buybacks offset the recent Jupuary airdrop, which led to selling pressure. The buybacks will be announced through a dashboard coming next week. The buybacks will be scheduled at every hour, aiming to bring back as much JUP as possible for a vesting period of three years. The buyback decision comes after the Catstanbul event that burned 3B JUP, reducing the total supply to 7B tokens. Even the burn was not enough to push JUP from its lows, as it was still absorbing selling from the Jupuary airdrop. Jupiter will aggregate fees from all its services and activities, storing all proceeds in a wallet. The fees may be in the form of various tokens, as balances will be transparently posted through the public address. The Jupiter service will include fees from its perpetual futures trades, DCA service, and other routing tools. From the total fees, 50% will be swapped into SOL and USDC for development activities, explained Jupiter cofounder @sssionggg . The rest of the funds will be used for the JUP buybacks, with all purchases going through Jupiter’s own routing. The USDC and SOL will be kept in the team’s multisig wallet, while JUP will be locked in a new vault, the Litter Box, and kept for three years. Jupiter fees got a boost in February Jupiter achieved over $500K in fees for the past 24 hours, ranking 14th among Solana apps and protocols. For the past month, Jupiter DEX fees reached a total of $4.8M. The recent heightened activity saw Jupiter fees rally in February, rising far above their baseline. The current activity may allow the buying of up to $250K in JUP tokens. Currently, all JUP trading is at over $260M in 24 hours, of which $37M is concentrated on Binance. The buying will have a somewhat limited effect on the price, but over time, it may start to make a dent in circulating JUP. The pace of buybacks may vary, as Jupiter may produce a lower or higher level of daily fees. For Jupiter DEX, the spike in swaps happened after January 20, reflecting the launch of Official Trump (TRUMP) and other celebrity tokens. Jupiter total swaps remained higher than the previous baseline. The rally at the beginning of 2025 finally lifted Jupiter activity, after remaining relatively low during the expansion at the end of 2024. Jupiter fees got a boost in February, after the new wave of official celebrity tokens launching on Solana in the past three weeks. | Source: DeFi Llama Jupiter peaked at over 190K daily users on January 21. Currently, swaps and fees remain elevated, despite registering under 20K daily users . The decision for the buyback arrives after Jupiter posted some of its biggest fee gains in history, following peak Solana activity in the past few weeks. The DEX and the aggregator service were among the most widely used on Solana for optimal routing and faster swaps. Following the news, JUP briefly spiked to $0.86, then retreated to $0.83. The token is at the lower end of its three-month range, despite the protocol’s peak performance. JUP has 2.63B tokens in circulation, out of a total supply of 10B. Most JUP is habitually held in reserves and in various forms of staking. The token is expected to break out soon, recovering from the selling pressure of Jupuary tokens. JUP fell from a local peak at $1.22, as new recipients traded in 67% of the newly received tokens. Jupuary aimed to spread JUP to a wider audience, though most turned into sellers. In an optimistic scenario, the buyback would lock over 9% of the JUP supply. The large-scale token burn and the buybacks also face the challenge of mitigating token unlocks. Fewer than 20% of JUP are unlocked, expecting a gradual increase in the available supply. The team’s early allocation and other holdings will start getting unlocked in H2, potentially putting more pressure on the market.

According to a post on X , this updated version will change the NFT market with several new features. OS2 offers a lower marketplace fee, an airdrop of its new SEA token, and adds support for 14 new blockchains. OpenSea OS2 Platform Comes With Lots of Benefits It is worth noting that OpenSea will significantly reduce marketplace fees to just 0.5%. This shift helps make the platform more appealing for creators and collectors by offering a cheaper way to buy, sell, and trade NFTs. Additionally, users will no longer pay swap fees, so they can complete transactions without any extra costs when swapping assets in the NFT market. Another notable improvement in OS2 is the addition of 14 new blockchains, including Sony’s Sonieum and Bored Ape’s Apechain. This gives users more options in picking the blockchain that fits their needs and creating chances for cross-chain compatibility. Furthermore, these new blockchains will work smoothly with the platform, improving the user experience and expanding NFTs available to everyone. Additionally, OpenSea affirmed that SEA token airdrop is coming soon, majorly for United States users. Although an exact date and time haven’t been revealed, this token will be important for the OS2 ecosystem. SEA token will provide new benefits and governance options as the platform develops. Meanwhile, OpenSea will reward its users with this airdrop to show its commitment to the community. OpenSea Sparks Airdrop Buzz Recall that in December 2024, OpenSea sparked excitement and speculation following its registration in the Cayman Islands . Pseudonymous researcher Waleswoosh, affiliated with the Azuki NFT collection, shared OpenSea’s official registration in the Cayman Islands with a screenshot. As such, the news stirred up speculations with the NFT community about an impending token launch and airdrop. Likewise, the news followed OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer’s announcement about the platform revival in November 2024. He promised a revamped version would launch in December but did not provide details. Since then, speculation about a token launch has grown. Many users wonder if this move signals a significant shift for OpenSea and its plans. OpenSea Unveils Seaport 1.6 for Next-Gen NFT Markets Meanwhile, OpenSea collaborated with the Seaport Working Group to release Seaport 1.6 , marking a new era for the NFT marketplace with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem. According to the company, Seaport 1.6 introduced a new feature called Seaport Hooks. Similar to Uniswap v4 Hooks, the Seaport Hook enables developers to create applications that significantly enhance NFTs’ liquidity and utility. Although Seaport serves as a protocol for facilitating peer-to-peer sales of on-chain items, the introduction of Seaport Hooks added a new dimension to NFT governance and functionality.

Qualified U.S. investors will have broad, balanced exposure to the crypto market through the instrument. It is the first approved of several applicants for similar ETFs. The Nasdaq Crypto Index follows nine cryptocurrencies that are weighted according to their market capitalizations. The index represents 75% of the market capitalization of all eligible assets and would add more cryptocurrencies to maintain that level, if necessary. A minimum investment of $100,000 is required. The ETF will have a limited start The ETF (ticker NCIQ) will initially only contain Bitcoin and Ether and will expand the mixture as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves more cryptos for listing. BTC and ETH currently make up 74.81% and 11.51% of the index, respectively. The index is passively managed and rebalanced quarterly. Besides BTC and ETH, the other cryptocurrencies currently on the index, in proportional order, are Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), Avalanche (AVAX) and Uniswap (UNI). NCIQ was listed at $4,827.98 per share at the time of writing, down 1.37% from the previous day. A mixed-crypto ETF is a popular product Brazil-based Hashdex and Nasdaq collaborated on the creation of the index in 2021, and similar products with the full spectrum of listed cryptos are available in several countries. The Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index Europe ETP has amassed over $500 million. The exchange-traded product (ETP) is traded on the Swiss SIX exchange, Deutsche Börse Xetra, Euronext Paris, and Euronext Amsterdam. The Brazilian Stock Exchange B3 lists a Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETP. It is listed in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands as well.

Users can apply Stars to transform a gift into an NFT, boosting its value and making it transferable on-chain. TON chain is growing its NFT activity, almost catching up with Bitcoin ordinals. The activity is based on Telegram gifts, which start out as images but can be minted as NFT. TON is a relatively new hub for NFT and is still niche compared to more established chains. However, TON NFT markets are in their rapid expansion chain, while older networks retain a fraction of their volumes. In the past 24 hours, TON showed its ability to carry an active NFT market . Performance may vary, but the consensus is TON is just starting out with a new wave of NFT. The emergence of a new NFT activity and the minting of collectibles may offset the lowered traffic on TON chain . TON expanded its NFT activity after establishing even closer connections to Telegram. The chat app added Gifts and a new in-app asset, Stars. A gift can still be traded or sent out, but Stars allow it to be minted into an NFT and traded on-chain. Stars can reach all Telegram users, especially those interacting with mini apps. Telegram estimates up to 400M users seek out mini apps and games. Telegram stars make use of the TON blockchain but are also compatible with the Apple Store and Google Appstore. The assets can support creators, make in-app purchases, and are used to trade Gifts as NFT. Upgrading a gift costs a relatively small amount of Stars, which is used to cover network fees. Stars can be bought at $0.016, with fees for purchasing through app stores. Later, the NFT can appreciate and trade on the secondary market. The recent NFT boom may revive interest in TON chain. The native TON token lost some of its positions during the latest market correction, sliding to $3.74. TON chain lost the hype from tap-to-earn games, its meme market was small compared to other chains, and the DeFi sector remained small. The recent digital gift boom and a focus on the Telegram chat app are seen as a source of growth. TON chain also aims to become more transparent and tap the US market. Collectible gifts come with unique features TON chain NFT starts out as regular Telegram gifts, and can be upgraded to collectible through stars. The new collectible item unlocks new characteristics, such as background color, icon, and serial number. There are more than 20 gifts that have additional art and features created, allowing for up to 1,400 unique combinations when minting. TON chain avoided the approach of generating collections, instead seeking out organic growth for its items, as they are used inside the chat app. The organic growth meant gifts and collectibles expanded with activity on Telegram. Gifts took about three months to turn into an NFT sensation and increase their volumes. More than 20M gifts have been minted as collectibles as of January 2025, with more created among the most popular gifts. NFT mints accelerated in the past three months, tapping the Telegram gifts trend. | Source: TON stat GetGems and MarketApp are currently the most active TON NFT markets, reporting hundreds of users each day. Fragment was the most active marketplace in the last 24 hours, carrying $374.8K in sales. The Fragment marketplace also expanded its volumes by 70% in the past 24 hours, as the TON chain NFT usage was just starting out. Anonymous Telegram numbers and Telegram usernames are among the most active collections with the biggest number of holders. TON chain and Telegram aim to break out and reach a mass audience while offering seamless on-chain access. To that end, Telegram will only use TON chain and its native assets, removing other crypto coins and tokens as payments. The TON chain NFT ecosystem is mostly focused on fun and in-chat use cases. As a result, most NFT traded at a low price, with 64 TON for the most expensive and 0.2 TON on average. The goal of the NFT is not high-value collections, but daily turnover and utility. The collectibles can also be sent as minted, letting the end user in the chat unwrap the gift and see the unique features.

Dogecoin’s price is at $0.2587, struggling to maintain essential support as large holders continue to buy. On the other hand, Cardano sees more action from large investors, moving millions of tokens even after a 23% price fall. Analysts think it might recover, yet the future is uncertain. As meme coins and key altcoins face market shifts, the focus is shifting towards Web3 in ecommerce, which shows promise for substantial growth. Web3Bay’s presale is attracting early investors aiming for substantial gains by 2025. This platform integrates blockchain into online shopping, enabling users to manage their transactions and rewards through tokens. With initial pricing and growing interest, Web3Bay is emerging as a potentially lucrative opportunity ahead of its official launch. Why Web3Bay’s Presale Is Generating Buzz Now? Web3Bay is shaping up to be a pivotal player in online shopping by integrating Web3 into ecommerce through a decentralized market. It cuts out intermediaries, reduces fees, and grants buyers and sellers direct control. With blockchain-based transactions and community-led governance, Web3Bay offers a new shopping model where users have full control over their data and finances. As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, such platforms are increasingly in demand. Currently, Web3Bay’s presale is offering early participants a chance to invest before the full rollout. The presale has already accumulated over $1.17 million, selling more than 300 million tokens at a rate of $0.004562625 each. With a predicted presale ROI of 6430%, early investors could see significant advantages. Additionally, Web3Bay provides referral bonuses, rewarding users for bringing new investors. With the fluctuating predictions for major cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, some investors are turning their focus to projects with solid long-term prospects. Web3Bay merges ecommerce and blockchain, providing genuine token utility. As traditional markets keep charging high fees and controlling transactions, Web3Bay’s model is appealing to those seeking a more decentralized option. With presale prices remaining low, the opportunity to invest before it spikes is closing fast. Dogecoin Prediction: What’s Next for DOGE? Dogecoin’s price is currently around $0.2587, facing difficulties in maintaining key support levels after a recent decrease. The meme coin has weakened, dropping below its 50-day and 100-day EMAs. Despite this, there is notable whale activity, with significant holders buying up nearly 750 million DOGE during this low. This shows some confidence from large investors, yet the possibility of a price recovery will depend on overall market conditions and investor interest. A significant development is the launch of Grayscale’s Dogecoin Trust, aiming to bring institutional investors to DOGE. This might boost its adoption; however, technical signs advise caution as DOGE hovers around a vital support area. The future of Dogecoin is still up in the air, with experts looking for signs of either a price surge or further declines. If buying interest increases, DOGE may approach new resistance levels, but currently, the market direction is unclear. ADA Whale Activity: Will Cardano Bounce Back from Its Recent Decline? Cardano is under pressure following a 23% fall in price, yet ADA whale activity indicates that major investors remain active. These large holders are moving millions of ADA, raising hopes for a potential recovery. ADA is now close to its 200-day moving average, with its RSI at its lowest since last October, suggesting the asset might be undervalued. Should the momentum shift, a price recovery could be on the horizon, though the market’s future is still uncertain. Furthermore, Swedish asset manager Virtune has introduced Cardano ETPs on Nasdaq Helsinki, increasing institutional access to ADA. Some analysts view this positively, although caution prevails. Unlike the volatile Dogecoin, ADA’s future movements will rely on its ability to recover important technical levels and attract fresh investment. The Bottom Line Both Dogecoin and ADA are showing mixed signals. DOGE is struggling to hold crucial support yet enjoys robust whale support, whereas ADA’s recent price drop has placed it in potentially undervalued territory, suggesting a chance for recovery. Both cryptocurrencies are seeing institutional interest, yet short-term outcomes are still uncertain. Therefore, some are turning their attention to Web3 in ecommerce, a sector promising real-world applications and substantial growth potential. Web3Bay’s crypto presale has already raised over $1.17 million, and with a projected ROI of 6430%, early participants are locking in their positions before the price increases. As traditional platforms continue to hike fees, Web3Bay is creating a decentralized marketplace that empowers its users. The presale period is limited, and as prices are set to rise, the current low investment threshold will soon disappear.

BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus code has fueled its presale past $194 million, offering structured incentives that ensure steady demand and reduce volatility. Unlike speculative market moves, BlockDAG ’s approach builds long-term value, making it a standout in the sector. Meanwhile, Stacks has gained traction after its founder’s $10 million investment, reinforcing trust in Bitcoin layer solutions. Injective Protocol is also experiencing a surge, with a 25% price increase and rising on-chain activity. However, BlockDAG’s strategic execution and buyer enthusiasm suggest it leads the pack. FINALCALL700 is Supercharging BlockDAG Presale BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus code is driving record-breaking momentum, pushing the presale total to $194 million with over 18.4 billion BDAG coins sold. As a result, offering a 350% bonus has fueled a surge in buyer participation, making it one of the most successful crypto presales of the year. Currently, in batch 27, BDAG is priced at $0.0248, reflecting an ROI of 2,340% since batch 1. Moreover, presale incentives like FINALCALL700 play a crucial role in buyer psychology. By doing so, BlockDAG has created a sense of urgency, attracting both retail buyers and crypto whales looking to maximize early-stage returns. Similarly, this approach mirrors successful launches like Solana and Ethereum, where early buyers saw massive gains due to well-structured presale incentives. What’s more, BlockDAG sets itself apart through strategic execution. Unlike projects that offer arbitrary airdrops, the structured presale phases and timed bonuses ensure steady demand, preventing price volatility before launch. Consequently, this method not only builds buyer confidence but also solidifies BDAG’s position as a sought-after asset. Since the FINALCALL700 bonus is expiring soon, the presale is expected to push past new milestones. As interest continues to grow, BlockDAG’s approach proves that well-planned presale incentives can drive mass adoption and long-term growth. Therefore, buyers are watching closely, knowing that early participation in a strong project can be the difference between minor gains and life-changing returns. Stacks Founder Buys $10 Million in STX Muneeb Ali, the founder of Stacks, has accumulated $10 million worth of STX tokens, reinforcing his belief in the project’s long-term potential. Notably, his significant purchase aligns with Stacks’ ongoing advancements in Bitcoin layer solutions, particularly its role in enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications on Bitcoin. As a result, this move has sparked increased investor confidence, leading to a surge in STX’s price and market interest. Furthermore, Ali’s investment suggests optimism about Stacks’ growth trajectory, especially as Bitcoin layers gain traction in the industry. His deep involvement in the ecosystem, meanwhile, highlights his commitment to expanding Stacks’ capabilities and adoption. As a key figure behind the project, his financial stake could influence broader market sentiment, attracting further investment. Injective Protocol ($INJ) Gains Momentum Injective Protocol ($INJ) is showing bullish signs, with analysts predicting a positive market reaction. Since the start of 2025, $INJ has surged by 25%, climbing from a January 1 low of $9.96 to $12.45 as of February 10. In addition, trading volume has risen by 15% in the past week, reaching approximately $45 million, reflecting growing investor confidence. Meanwhile, Binance remains a key exchange for $INJ, with the $INJ/USDT pair accounting for $30 million in daily trades, followed by $INJ/BTC at $5 million. On-chain activity has also strengthened, with active addresses increasing by 10% to 12,500 and transaction volume rising by 8% to $100 million. These metrics, therefore, highlight increasing adoption and usage, reinforcing the asset’s potential for further gains. Strategic Growth Positions BlockDAG Ahead As buyer interest intensifies, BlockDAG, Stacks, and Injective Protocol continue to gain momentum. BlockDAG’s structured presale incentives, surpassing $194 million, set it apart by maintaining demand while preventing excessive volatility. Meanwhile, Stacks benefits from its founder’s $10 million investment, reinforcing confidence in Bitcoin layer solutions. Injective Protocol’s rising trading volume and price surge highlight increasing adoption. While all three projects show promise, BlockDAG’s carefully planned execution and investor enthusiasm indicate it holds a stronger position for long-term growth. With interest growing, its presale success underscores its potential as a more stable and strategically positioned investment opportunity.

This was primarily due to a massive increase in cryptocurrency transaction fees in the current quarter, which stood at $358 million, a 491% increase from the previous quarter. The increase in crypto revenue also brought a new interest in retail investing in digital assets. Robinhood’s highest cryptocurrency trading revenue of $233M was recorded in 2021, mainly due to DOGE trading. This notional volume was established in Q4 2024, and it was 400% higher than the volumes recorded in the previous year. Robinhood expanded its offerings, adding 7 new cryptocurrencies for its users in the United States, as well as Ethereum staking in the European Union. This decision reflects its general goals of targeting a steadily expanding audience of retail and institutional investors in cryptocurrencies. Strong financial performance and market response Notably, the company reported a net income of $916 million, well above analyst expectations. This impacted the company’s stock price, leading to a 7% increase in its shares to $60 in after-hours trading after the earnings report. The shares’ value has been soaring since the beginning of 2024, registering a 360% increase. The Assets Under Custody (AUC) also grew 88% to $193 billion yearly. This was attributed to steady net deposits and higher equities and cryptocurrency valuations. In June 2024, Robinhood announced plans to acquire global crypto exchange Bitstamp, pending regulatory approvals. The acquisition is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2025, positioning Robinhood for deeper institutional market penetration. Additionally, Robinhood revealed in June 2024 that it planned to buy global crypto exchange Bitstamp, pending regulatory approvals. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025, allowing Robinhood to penetrate the institutional markets better. Robinhood also expanded its trading products beyond cryptocurrencies. The company launched index options for all users and in-app futures trading, offering products across stocks, energy, currencies, metals, and crypto. In addition, Robinhood Legend, the desktop platform for active traders launched in October 2024, has seen the addition of nearly 30 new indicators and expanded to the crypto side. Regulatory challenges While Robinhood’s Q4 was solid financially, the company faced regulatory headwinds. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) ordered Robinhood Derivatives to suspend its sports event contracts. As a result, it decided to stop the rollout of the Pro Football Championship market that it had opened to a limited number of users. In addition, the company said it is committed to cooperating with regulators to make sure it is compliant. Robinhood’s reported performance comes amid a broader crypto market rally. Several altcoins posted major gains, while Bitcoin hit $100,000 for the first time in Q4.

As more investors join the presale, Lightchain AI is shaping up to be a key player in the next phase of blockchain innovation. In this article, we’ll explore why sequential buys are happening into Lightchain AI’s presale and what it means for the future of blockchain technology. Why Sequential Buys are Occurring? One after another buys are turning into a clear trend in Lightchain AI space, pushed by the project’s special tech way and market spot.

Both Solana and XRP have long been considered strong contenders in the blockchain ecosystem, with Solana known for its high-speed transactions and XRP for its payment solutions. However, the unique integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain offered by Lightchain AI presents a new level of competition. As investors in Solana and XRP witness the growing momentum behind Lightchain AI, some are beginning to diversify their portfolios. The project’s focus on scalable, AI-driven solutions introduces a compelling alternative that could capture market share. While Solana and XRP remain established players, the emergence of a technologically advanced rival like Lightchain AI is likely to reshape investor strategies and broaden the competitive landscape.

As more investors enter the presale, Lightchain AI is poised to become a significant player in the upcoming wave of blockchain advancements. In this article, we delve into why these sequential buys are occurring in Lightchain AI's presale and what it signifies for blockchain's future. Reasons Behind the Sequential Purchases The series of purchases within the Lightchain AI environment is forming a distinct pattern, driven by the project's unique technological approach and market positioning. Unlike speculative tokens, Lightchain AI combines artificial intelligence with blockchain to deliver enhanced and scalable solutions. This innovation is attracting both early adopters and experienced investors who recognize its long-term potential.

As Solana and XRP investors observe the growing momentum behind Lightchain AI, some are opting to diversify their investment portfolios. The project's commitment to scalable, AI-powered solutions offers a compelling alternative that could capture a portion of the market.

As Bitcoin remains at the forefront of the DeFi landscape, innovative projects like Mutuum Finance are emerging to broaden the spectrum of opportunities. Currently in its presale stage, Mutuum Finance introduces a novel approach to decentralized lending and borrowing, allowing investors to engage in a burgeoning sector poised for further achievements in 2025. Introducing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized platform crafted to streamline lending and borrowing in the crypto realm, making these processes both simple and rewarding. It operates with two distinctive markets aimed at fulfilling varied user demands: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C market leverages automated smart contracts to securely and efficiently manage transactions, simplifying user participation. Meanwhile, the P2P market enables direct user interaction, offering enhanced flexibility and access to a wider variety of assets, including newly introduced or niche tokens. For those supplying assets, Mutuum Finance provides an avenue to earn passive income by depositing assets like USDT into liquidity pools, allowing their investments to grow over time. Borrowers can utilize their crypto assets, such as Ethereum, as collateral to obtain funds without needing to liquidate their holdings. For instance, by depositing Ethereum, a borrower can secure a portion of its value in USDT for personal or investment purposes. Now is potentially the perfect moment to invest in MUTM tokens, which are currently available at the lowest presale price of $0.01. Experts forecast that this token will increase by over 1000% upon launch, with an expected price of $0.06 or more. This projected growth is fueled by the platform's strong emphasis on utility, particularly its lending and borrowing functions, alongside the planned beta platform launch that coincides with the token release. These initiatives are anticipated to boost demand and adoption significantly, making Mutuum Finance a compelling investment prospect in the DeFi arena. Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself through its tangible benefits and a clearly outlined growth strategy. For those eager to enter the DeFi market early, MUTM offers a promising chance to invest in a project with substantial success potential. The tokenomics of Mutuum Finance are thoughtfully structured to encourage growth and reward community involvement. With a total supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens, the distribution plan ensures the platform's sustainability and attractiveness to investors. A significant share, 45.5%, is designated for the presale, providing early investors access to MUTM tokens at an attractive entry price. An additional 10% is allocated for liquidity mining and incentives, rewarding both suppliers and borrowers who actively support the platform's ecosystem. These incentives promote liquidity and engagement, which are vital for the platform's long-term success. Moreover, 10% of the tokens are reserved to foster ecosystem growth and support developer contributions, ensuring ongoing innovation and expansion. Remaining allocations are carefully distributed for partnerships, platform liquidity, and community incentives. This well-balanced token distribution not only encourages participation but also lays a solid foundation for price stability and growth, making MUTM an appealing option for investors. With a clear focus on utility and scalability, Mutuum Finance's tokenomics aim to deliver sustainable value to its users and stakeholders. Bitcoin DeFi TVL Rockets by 2,000% in 2024 Bitcoin-centric decentralized finance (DeFi) experienced an extraordinary surge in 2024, with total value locked (TVL) increasing by a staggering 2,000%. This explosive growth was spurred by significant advancements such as the introduction of Bitcoin staking platforms and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. These developments not only bolstered investor confidence but also highlighted Bitcoin's growing role beyond its traditional use as a store of value, reinforcing its standing in the DeFi sector. The rise in TVL highlights the escalating demand for Bitcoin-driven financial solutions. With projects launching innovative protocols and increased capital pouring into Bitcoin-native DeFi platforms, the network is demonstrating its ability to compete with other ecosystems like Ethereum. The blend of technological advancement, rising prices, and institutional interest positions Bitcoin DeFi as a pivotal area to monitor as we head into 2025. Bitcoin and Mutuum Finance are each shaping the future of decentralized finance in their distinct ways. Bitcoin's record-setting DeFi growth in 2024 underscores its expanding utility and investor trust, while Mutuum Finance introduces fresh opportunities with its practical lending and borrowing features. As these platforms develop, they present exciting prospects for those eager to engage in the next wave of crypto innovation.

From high-energy presales to booming market caps, the hottest contenders in the game right now are BTFD Coin, Memecoin (MEME), and Ponke. MEME is flexing a $178M market cap, Ponke is making waves at $82M, and BTFD Coin’s presale just blasted past $6.05 million, with Stage 14 nearly sold out. But here’s where things get wild—BTFD Coin isn’t just about hype. Its referral program is turning investors into instant winners, and every purchase in Stage 14 is DOUBLED when you use the LAUNCH100 bonus code . That’s free tokens just for acting fast.

40297862,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=695681,1739493037,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Dogecoin Breakout Coming? Analyst Identifies Key Price Level,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-breakout-key-price-level/,"In his latest technical breakdown posted on X, analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) highlighted a pivotal threshold on Dogecoin’s daily chart. According to Kevin, reclaiming the $0.28 region on a weekly close—and then showing clear follow-through—could set Dogecoin on a path toward retesting its all-time highs. He notes: “Get back above the .28 cents level on Dogecoin on a weekly close and show follow through and my thought process is we attack the highs not too long after that. I have been allocating into a spot long at .25 cents on DOGE in the Patreon via the Trading Portfolio (separate from long term bag). Ready for either outcome. Let’s send this thing higher.” When Will The Dogecoin Correction End? The chart highlights a well-known metric called the Bitcoin Bull Market Support Band, applied here to Dogecoin, which consists of the 20-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Although this indicator was originally developed for Bitcoin, many analysts extend it to altcoins to determine whether the broader trend is bullish or bearish. In Dogecoin’s current setup, this band hovers in the $0.282–$0.286 range. Price dipped below it last week and now facing a key resistance zone between $0.27 and $0.29. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready For A $2.43 Rally? Elliott Wave Says Yes Beyond the price levels, Kevin also points to two momentum studies. On the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI), the yellow line has crossed above its accompanying moving average, suggesting that bearish pressure may be easing. The RSI hovers near 38, which is above a notable support region around 27. Notably, the yellow RSI line is now back above its pink moving average (MA) line. According to Kevin, this may be an early sign of a shift in sentiment if follow-through buying continues. Another important technical feature is the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), which is nearing a bullish crossover. The MACD line is approaching the signal line, and if this crossover is confirmed, it could generate positive momentum for Dogecoin. Kevin marks this as a “Pending Daily Bullish MACD Cross,” which, if validated, would add further credence to the bullish outlook. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holding Strong—Analyst Says $4 Rally Could Be Next In the larger scheme, the chart underscores that a firm weekly close above $0.28 is the key catalyst. This level aligns with the Bull Market Support Band, and if reclaimed decisively, could accelerate Dogecoin’s push toward mid-$0.30s or beyond, provided broader market conditions remain conducive. In another post, Kevin explained: “I have been saying it for weeks now while the rest have said its altseason. We are in a major correctional period. These periods happen in markets in case you never noticed. Crypto is very driven off the macro, especially altcoins. We want to hold these levels on Total Market Cap if we want to feel good about this market otherwise the correction can go deeper. In the mean time Chill out. Still billions in liquidity up to $111K on BTC that will be taken eventually.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.25.

With its presale currently active, the project presents an early chance for those interested in leveraging its lending services and vision for a fully backed stablecoin. Analysts are hopeful about its future, forecasting notable expansion for the MUTM token. Meanwhile, Cardano's research has underscored the blockchain's growing influence in solving real-world issues. Emphasizing areas such as traceability, authenticity, and sustainability, Cardano illustrates the practical application of blockchain technology in supporting global industries. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): An Overview Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that empowers users to participate as both lenders and borrowers. It offers a straightforward platform for users to deposit their crypto assets into specific liquidity pools, earn interest, and borrow against collateral. By prioritizing transparency, adaptability, and security, Mutuum Finance aims to establish a proficient ecosystem for handling digital assets. Lenders can contribute their cryptocurrencies to Mutuum’s liquidity pools, earning returns based on the utilization rate of the pool. Borrowers can tap into these funds by securing collateral that exceeds the loan amount. This overcollateralization safeguards the platform's stability and reduces risk for users. Mutuum Finance functions with two main lending frameworks: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C framework, smart contracts oversee the lending and borrowing operations automatically. Users can lend or borrow assets without needing to directly connect with someone else. This setup ensures transactions are efficient and secure, appealing to users who prefer minimal involvement. Conversely, the P2P framework enables direct interaction between users. Borrowers and lenders can negotiate terms, offering flexibility not found in the P2C market. Moreover, the P2P market supports assets not usually available in the P2C market, like memecoins or new tokens, broadening opportunities for users with particular interests. Mutuum structures its lending markets around specific liquidity pools for each supported cryptocurrency. Lenders earn interest by placing assets into these pools, obtaining mtTokens as proof of their deposits. These mtTokens automatically reflect accrued interest, streamlining the process for users. Borrowers can obtain funds from these pools by securing collateral that surpasses the loan value, ensuring overcollateralization. The platform assigns a Loan-To-Value (LTV) ratio to each asset, determining its borrowing capacity based on liquidity and volatility. Borrowers have the option to repay loans partially or entirely at any time, as long as they maintain a suitable collateral-to-debt ratio to prevent liquidation. For Lenders: A user deposits 1 ETH into a Mutuum liquidity pool and gets back 1 mtETH token. Over time, the mtETH token accumulates interest according to the pool’s utilization rate. When the user decides to redeem their mtETH after several months, they might withdraw 1.05 ETH, including the interest earned (subject to current interest rates). For Borrowers: An investor holds 2 ETH and wishes to borrow 1 ETH. They use their 2 ETH as collateral in Mutuum, ensuring the loan is overcollateralized. Upon full repayment of the loan, the borrower can reclaim their collateral. By integrating its P2C and P2P markets with strong lending and borrowing frameworks, Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself as a versatile and secure DeFi platform. This configuration not only addresses diverse user requirements but also supports a dynamic and sustainable ecosystem for ongoing growth. Cardano Study Showcases Blockchain Advancements A recent study by the Cardano Foundation has illuminated the expanding impact of blockchain technology, particularly focusing on initiatives within the Cardano ecosystem. The analysis covered over 580 projects, revealing that a majority aim to tackle real-world problems in areas like traceability, authenticity, and sustainability. Approximately 55% of these projects concentrate on authenticity, providing secure verification for identities and data, while 30% focus on traceability to create transparent records for digital and physical asset verification. This underscores Cardano's capability to address significant global issues with practical blockchain solutions. Cardano's international presence is also evident, with 70% of its projects targeting global markets. The platform’s scalability and adaptability have made it a preferred option for enterprises and developers worldwide. By supporting a wide range of applications, Cardano is driving the role of blockchain in resolving industry challenges, from ensuring supply chain transparency to promoting environmental efforts. This growth not only highlights the platform's adaptability but also its potential to effect meaningful change across multiple sectors. Reasons to Consider Investing in Mutuum Finance by 2025 Mutuum Finance presents investors with the opportunity to enter at the most affordable price during its presale phase, with MUTM tokens available for just $0.01. The project's strong emphasis on practical utilities, including its decentralized lending platform and plans for a fully collateralized stablecoin, sets it up for substantial growth.
