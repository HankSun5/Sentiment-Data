In a recent tweet, John Reed Stark, a former official at the SEC, claimed in this regard that the agency’s crypto enforcement division is now “dead and buried.” The SEC Crypto Unit is Now Unofficially Dead and Buried Per LinkedIn, the SEC’s “Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit,” is now the “Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit.” It won’t be long before the SEC’s website reflects the new name. Stick a fork in SEC crypto-enforcement, it’s done. pic.twitter.com/9JkywyZ30Q — John Reed Stark (@JohnReedStark) February 13, 2025 The SEC recently changed the name of the enforcement units related to cryptocurrencies on LinkedIn from “crypto assets” to “emerging technologies.” According to Stark , the move was initiated by the Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda to effectively disband crypto enforcement. Stark also further opined that the SEC would tone down on operations regarding cryptocurrencies. He said that the agency might withdraw or dismiss some of the already pending cases. The SEC paused its case against Binance for two months earlier this week adding to the belief of the dwindling enforcement activities. Currently, the SEC has not formally addressed the rebranding of the agency’s crypto enforcement unit. However, Stark opined that the agency’s website would soon change in the same regard. He stated, “It won’t be long before the SEC’s website reflects this new name. Perhaps the SEC will roll out the new name as some sort of feeble rebranding attempt.” SEC reevaluates crypto regulation strategy During a recent interview , commissioner Hester Peirce also acknowledged that the agency is reevaluating its approach to the crypto sphere. The SEC has often used enforcement actions to mediate the industry while recognizing that such measures are not conventional in policymaking. She insisted that they need rules and structure, not to pursue litigation-based regulation. “During the past several years, enforcement cases have been used as a way to make regulatory policy; that is very atypical,” Peirce stated. “We’re trying to get back to a path where we’re really using our other tools to make policy.” As noted by Stark, the SEC recently asked for a sixty-day stop to its ongoing legal case against Binance. In its defense, the agency stated the crypto task force would affect ongoing legal cases. The agency’s new direction may affect its former actions under the latest updated enforcement strategy. New task force and legal case reviews Peirce is currently leading the SEC’s crypto division, which focuses on creating a legal framework for the use of cryptocurrencies. The unit is tasked with determining which cryptocurrencies are securities and the SEC’s regulatory role in the market. The agency is also considering active litigation with leading crypto companies such as Binance, Ripple, and Coinbase. Peirce did not clarify whether there would be any dismissal of cases, but she said all would be decided on a case-by-case basis.“It’s facts and circumstances,” she said. “We’ll have to look at each case and its merits as we go forward.” Some cases have already experienced delays. In the SEC’s lawsuit against Lejilex, the two parties decided to postpone the oral arguments, which were initially planned for February 20th, increasing the decision duration to at least April 11, 2025. The uncertainty regarding cryptocurrency under the SEC has shifted alongside other regulatory policies under Trump’s presidency. After his Inauguration, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to create a panel that will consider how crypto is regulated. The government is also exploring the idea of creating a national crypto stockpile, which might influence the industry’s progress.

Despite a sharp rally to as high as $3.4, XRP has cooled down, now hovering around $2.50. While Ripple (XRP) still has the potential to rise again with factors like ETF hype, and regulatory changes in the U.S., the surrounding excitement has definitely cooled. At its current price of $2.47, Ripple (XRP) has already had its big moment. Now, the attention is shifting to a token with even more potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently priced at the lowest entry of $0.01, MUTM is attracting serious interest from crypto bulls. Having predictions pointing to a 100x gain to $1, it’s the kind of opportunity XRP investors can only dream of at this point. Unlike Ripple (XRP), which is riding out its post-rally phase, Mutuum Finance is still in the first phase of its presale, offering a fresh chance for massive returns. Additionally, its DeFi platform with features like Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending is drawing in investors looking for real utility. While XRP may have had its time in the spotlight, MUTM is where the real growth potential lies. Mutuum Finance: Revolutionizing Crypto Lending Mutuum Finance is reshaping the DeFi market with its innovative dual lending models. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system automates lending through smart contracts, enabling users to earn up to 10% APY while borrowing against ETH collateral without selling their holdings. Meanwhile, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model removes intermediaries, allowing lenders to set their own rates and terms for a more flexible and transparent lending experience. Investor demand is surging as the MUTM presale moves through its initial phase. With tokens priced at $0.01, over 620 investors have already contributed $420,000, and the price is set to climb to $0.06 at launch, offering an impressive 600% gain before reaching major exchanges. Market analysts anticipate an even greater upside, with projections pointing toward a potential $1 target post-listing, making this a preferable early investment. Mutuum Finance is preparing to launch a collateral-backed stablecoin, designed to enhance financial stability and platform liquidity. Additionally, the introduction of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) will grant token holders governance rights, ensuring a transparent, community-driven future for the project. To reward its growing community, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway. Ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, making this an exciting incentive for early adopters. How To Buy MUTM Tokens Here is a simple process on how to buy MUTM tokens Set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet with crypto funds. Go to the Mutuum Finance presale page. Select your investment amount. Confirm the transaction. Receive your MUTM tokens, which can be claimed after the presale ends. While Ripple (XRP) already had its moment in the spotlight, the focus is now shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a promising altcoin that offers crypto bulls the opportunity to capitalize on its early-stage growth. The potential for substantial returns is undeniable With a presale price of just $0.01. Market analysts are projecting a 100x gain, with the price possibly reaching $1. Mutuum Finance’s innovative DeFi lending models and upcoming ecosystem expansions, including a USD-pegged stablecoin and a projected DAO, make it a project worth watching closely. Don’t miss out on this early opportunity, invest in MUTM now to be part of the next big thing in crypto.

However, the burning question is whether the price can rally past the $0.05 mark or whether a new underdog altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , will overshadow it as its $0.0420 presale explodes. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Underdog Altcoin Presale Set To Explode Experts remain sure of a $0.10 target for the Shiba Inu price, but WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents something fresh and auspicious. The underdog altcoin is selling at $0.0420 in presale, giving investors a rare opportunity to get in early before it explodes. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform brings a whole new level of utility to the crypto market with features that will make it a household name in the coming months. The platform will soon launch its beta version , while its MVP build introduces a Scan and Pay QR code system for wallet addresses, eliminating the need to input addresses manually. Moreover, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers incredible incentives for presale investors. Those who buy into the presale early can stake their tokens to earn an annual percentage yield (APY) of up to 180%, along with governance rights and discounted transaction fees. Through its referral program, WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale investors can earn bonuses in native tokens by inviting others to join the ecosystem. The underdog altcoin presale incentivizes current investors, creating a network effect that could drive up the altcoin’s value in the long run. WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale investors will always have the proper asset allocation for maximum profitability, as the crypto wallet’s predictive algorithms automatically rebalance portfolios based on market trends. Investors have been waiting for this level of automation and precision, and it is now available through the underdog altcoin’s presale. The SolidProof audit of WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) smart contract affirms that the platform is free from vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of malicious attacks or scams. The underdog altcoin presale presents a much more secure, utility-driven path to profitability, with the bonus of incredibly low presale prices. Shiba Inu Price: A $0.10 Target Still Possible, But Can It Rally Past $0.05? The Shiba Inu (SHIB) current price of $0.00001522 makes experts cautiously optimistic about its potential. While they agree that a $0.10 target is still possible, the path to that milestone isn’t smooth. Reaching $0.10 would require a staggering surge of over 500,000%, an incredibly challenging feat. Even hitting $0.05 is no small task, given the current market conditions The Shiba Inu price recently dropped to a six-month low of $0.00001160, only to recover slightly before falling again. Despite these challenges, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community remains hopeful, with some experts pointing to its 13% rise in January as a sign of underlying strength. However, as the market becomes more competitive, questions arise: Can the Shiba Inu price rally past $0.05? The token’s market cap is still modest, but at $0.10, Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) market cap would skyrocket to a staggering $58.87 trillion. However, with the ongoing challenges and fierce competition from newer projects, it’s unclear whether the Shiba Inu price will see such a dramatic rise. Conclusion: Make Your Move To The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Altcoin Presale Now The Shiba Inu price forecast may hold hope for some experts, with a $0.10 target still in sight. Still, the real opportunity lies in the underdog altcoin WallitIQ (WLTQ) . With its unique AI-powered platform , staking rewards, and presale bonuses, the altcoin offers investors a chance to get in early and potentially see massive returns. While the Shiba Inu price forecast suggests that the $0.10 target could still be achievable, it’s far from guaranteed, requiring a monumental effort to surpass $0.05. However, like any opportunity, the window for maximum profits with the WallitIQ (WLTQ) underdog altcoin presale won’t stay open forever. Experts say investors should quickly take advantage of the altcoin’s unique high-yield utilities and potential. Buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) early during the $0.0420 presale and benefit from the potential to grow your investment exponentially as the underdog altcoin explodes.

The platform even plans to reward its loyal users with free $SEA tokens, though it has yet to reveal any further details. Devin Finzer, Co-founder and CEO of OpenSea, remarked : This represents an expansion of OpenSea from an NFT marketplace to a much broader platform for trading all types of cryptos. We think tokens and NFTs belong together in a single, powerful, delightful experience. Devin Finzer OpenSea will distribute SEA tokens to reward its users OpenSea’s new OS trading platform will support cross-chain token purchases and initially offer lower fees for its users. Moreover, OpenSea Foundation, a Cayman Islands-based institution, promised to distribute $SEA tokens to reward and engage NFT users and offer utility on the OS2 platform. The foundation has yet to specify when it will start distributing tokens or even how many tokens will go to its users. The company, however, confirmed that its planned airdrop will cover both active users and the platform’s first users. US users will also be eligible for the airdrop. Additionally, the company insists that SEA’s utility is meant to be long-term rather than short-lived speculation. It even posted on X the several advantages OS2 has to offer, including how consumers can now access NFTs and crypto tokens on the same platform and how the utility has 14 new chains, including ApeChain and BSL. Hu believes their new platform and token will help grow community support for NFTs Fizner argued that beta testers put emphasis on building speed, reliability, and quality of its new utility, saying the OS2 feels right. Additionally, James Hu, the general manager of the OpenSea Foundation, says that OS2 should help the community grow and improve the OpenSea ecosystem. He further states that the presence of the $SEA token will increase the incentive for community members to get involved and support the NFT ecosystem. So far, OpenSea’s annualized revenues are at $33 million after facilitating the trading of $190 million worth of NFTs in the previous month. However, its trading volume has dipped from its record highs in 2021.

This sharp decline has left investors on edge, fueling fear and uncertainty as Avalanche mirrors the bearish trends seen across the broader crypto market. Doubts about AVAX’s potential to recover and generate significant gains have started to dominate market sentiment, leaving many questioning whether a rebound is possible in the near term. Related Reading: Cardano Could Move Up To $0.83 If Momentum Holds – Can ADA Sustain A Breakout? However, amidst this uncertainty, there are signs that Avalanche may be preparing for a turnaround. According to key metrics shared by top analyst Ali Martinez, Avalanche is showing promising signs of a potential rebound. Martinez highlights that a key technical indicator has flashed a buy signal on the weekly chart, offering a glimmer of hope for a recovery rally. This signal suggests that AVAX might be nearing a bottom, and if market conditions align, it could mark the beginning of a new bullish phase. As the market remains volatile, all eyes are on Avalanche to see if this buy signal can translate into sustained upward momentum. Investors are cautiously optimistic, hoping that AVAX can overcome current challenges and reclaim its bullish potential. Avalanche Indicator Signals A Potential Trend Reversal Avalanche (AVAX) has been stuck in a state of indecision as bulls fail to reclaim the $27 mark, while bears struggle to push the price further down. This tug-of-war reflects the broader uncertainty in the crypto market, leaving Avalanche at a critical juncture. Analysts are divided on the next move for AVAX, with some predicting a massive recovery rally while others anticipate a continuation of the bearish trend that has gripped the market since mid-December. Top analyst Ali Martinez has added to the discussion by sharing a technical analysis on X that reveals promising signs for Avalanche. Martinez highlights that the TD Sequential indicator, a widely used tool for identifying trend exhaustion and potential price reversals, has flashed a buy signal on the weekly chart. This is significant, as weekly signals carry more weight and often suggest the possibility of long-term reversals. If bulls capitalize on this signal and push the price above the $27 resistance level, it could trigger a broader recovery phase. On the flip side, failure to hold current levels may lead to further consolidation or downside movement as bears attempt to regain control. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Have Bought Over 600,000 ETH In The Past Week – Time For A Price Upswing? The coming days and weeks will be crucial for Avalanche, as the price action will either validate the bullish signal or reinforce the prevailing bearish sentiment. Investors are closely monitoring the $27 level and the implications of the TD Sequential signal, as it could mark the beginning of a long-awaited recovery rally for AVAX. AVAX Price Consolidates Between Key Levels Avalanche (AVAX) is trading at $25.6 after several days of indecision and consolidation within a narrow range, stuck below the $27 resistance level and above the $23 support zone. This tight range reflects the ongoing uncertainty in the broader market as bulls and bears battle for control. Bulls face a crucial test at current levels. They need to hold the $25 support zone and build momentum to push AVAX above the key $28.7 resistance level. Breaking and reclaiming this mark as support would confirm a trend reversal, signaling the start of a potential recovery rally. A successful breakout above $28.7 could attract more buyers and lead to a move into higher price levels. However, selling pressure remains a significant risk for AVAX. If the price loses the $23 support level, the bearish trend that has dominated since mid-December could continue. A breakdown below this range would likely take AVAX into lower demand zones, with $20 being the next critical support level.

Cardano has just implemented the Plomin hard fork, transitioning to full decentralized governance and empowering ADA holders with voting rights on critical matters. At the same time, DOGE is drawing attention with substantial whale buys—750 million tokens recently—and its addition to a new Grayscale trust fuels discussions on its future potential. As ADA and DOGE advance their ecosystems, Web3Bay is transforming the e-commerce landscape. Unlike traditional models like Amazon, which dictates fees and policies, Web3Bay operates as a web3 crypto marketplace where community members set the rules. Smart contracts eliminate intermediaries, staking rewards consumers, and DAO governance gives control back to the users. As the sphere of crypto shopping grows, Web3Bay is at the forefront. Web3Bay Revolutionizes E-Commerce: $1.17M Presale & a New Era of Blockchain Marketplace Amazon may dominate with strict control over pricing, fees, and policies, but Web3Bay is turning things around. This web3 crypto marketplace empowers its users with decentralized governance, allowing buyers and sellers to set their own transaction terms independently. Smart contracts take over where third-party systems left off, promoting trustless, transparent dealings. Users benefit from reduced fees and direct earnings, marking a significant shift from traditional e-commerce platforms that profit at the merchants’ expense. Web3Bay is not just an idea—it’s a thriving marketplace with a presale already topping $1.17 million. More than 300 million 3BAY tokens have been sold at a current price of $0.004562625. With its DAO structure, Web3Bay enables community voting on important updates and policies. The platform not only offers a place to trade but also rewards buyers through staking options that provide passive income during transactions. Early participants in Web3Bay may find significant long-term advantages as the platform grows. As more people adopt cryptocurrencies, Web3Bay is poised to become the preferred decentralized shopping destination. With the rising interest in Cardano’s ADA and a growing focus on decentralization across various sectors, Web3Bay is leveraging these principles to redefine online shopping, benefiting users over corporations. The landscape of e-commerce is evolving, and Web3Bay is leading the change. ADA Price Outlook: Major Upgrades Propel Cardano Forward Cardano’s recent Plomin hard fork marks a significant leap towards complete decentralization. This update grants ADA holders the ability to vote on protocol changes and treasury allocations. As a result, Cardano edges closer to a fully community-driven blockchain, solidifying its presence in the cryptocurrency world. With a focus on decentralized governance, Cardano is showcasing its dedication to lasting sustainability and ongoing innovation. Currently, the ADA price hovers around $0.71, supported strongly by technical indicators at crucial levels. Moreover, institutional interest is climbing—Swedish company Virtune has just introduced a staked Cardano ETP on Nasdaq Helsinki, providing 2% staking rewards. As Cardano evolves, its drive towards decentralization and growing real-world use could spur further increases. DOGE Crypto Builds Momentum as Whales Increase Holdings Big investors are actively acquiring 750 million DOGE crypto amid recent price lows, indicating a robust confidence in Dogecoin’s prospects, particularly as it attracts more institutional players. The introduction of Grayscale’s Dogecoin Trust offers investors a formal avenue to engage with DOGE, enhancing its legitimacy and stirring more speculation on its broader acceptance. DOGE is trading at approximately $0.2493, maintaining a stable trajectory despite market oscillations. With ADA also capturing interest following Cardano’s updates, both meme coins and utility-centric tokens are drawing attention. As Dogecoin widens its footprint in mainstream finance, backed by a strong community and enhanced adoption, it is poised to maintain its growth. A Closer Look Cardano’s transition to fully decentralized governance represents a pivotal change, placing more power into the community’s hands. With the ADA price remaining robust and new institutional-grade staked ETPs emerging, Cardano’s outlook is bright. Concurrently, DOGE crypto witnesses substantial whale interest, and its integration into Grayscale’s trust lends it additional authenticity. As these cryptocurrencies enhance their ecosystems, Web3Bay challenges conventional e-commerce practices. Unlike Amazon, this web3 crypto marketplace empowers buyers and sellers to dictate terms, cuts out intermediaries, and lowers costs.

However, data shows a longer timeframe for this to be achieved. Meanwhile, savvy investors are turning their attention to a new horizon, with one expert spotlighting PropiChain (PCHAIN) , an AI altcoin, as a potential game-changer, forecasting gains that could reach a staggering 40,000%. Shiba Inu Price Faces Pressure as Whale Exodus Raises Concerns The recent decline in Shiba Inu whale activity is raising red flags for investors, as large transactions have plummeted by 85%, indicating a significant shift in market behavior. Historically, whales play a crucial role in maintaining liquidity and influencing the Shiba Inu price action, but with inflows dropping by over 91% and major holders offloading 1.13 trillion SHIB in a single day, the market is seeing increased volatility. This exodus coincides with the Shiba Inu price decline from its November high of $0.000033 to the current $0.000016 level, suggesting waning confidence among large holders. While SHIB’s RSI at 37.38 signals that it is approaching oversold territory, resistance at $0.000018 remains a major hurdle. Without renewed accumulation, further downside pressure could push the Shiba Inu price toward the $0.000015 support zone. PropiChain (PCHAIN): The AI-Powered Altcoin Set to Improve Real Estate Investing The global real estate sector, valued at over $300 trillion, has long struggled with inefficiencies, fraud, and restricted access. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is transforming the industry, using blockchain and AI to eliminate these issues while rivaling the Shiba Inu price movement. One of its key features is its ability to fractionalize high-value properties, a game-changer in an industry traditionally dominated by those who can afford entire properties. With PropiChain, investors can acquire fractions of prime real estate assets, allowing for greater diversification and improved liquidity in a sector notorious for being illiquid. Beyond ownership, the platform provides an easy exit strategy for investors, allowing them to trade their tokens in a seamless marketplace. This eliminates the delays and complexity associated with conventional real estate transactions, enhancing liquidity for both individual and institutional players. PropiChain’s AI integration further elevates its impact by leveraging predictive analytics. The platform provides real-time, data-driven insights into property valuation, market trends, and investment opportunities. PCHAIN’s AI and ML algorithms analyze historical sales data and economic indicators to generate accurate property valuations, ensuring smarter investment decisions. Transactions are also automated through AI-driven smart contracts, allowing investors to set predefined conditions, such as purchasing a property once a specific price is met. This automation optimizes market conditions, reduces errors, and streamlines the transaction process. Security remains a top priority for PropiChain, with its decentralized ledger, “Title Contract,” ensuring transparency in all transactions. Each property transfer, lease agreement, and financial transaction is recorded immutably on the blockchain, preventing fraud and providing a verifiable ownership history. PCHAIN has completed an in-depth smart contract audit conducted by BlockAudit , a highly reputable blockchain security firm known for its rigorous audits. The audit assessed PropiChain’s smart contracts for vulnerabilities, ensuring that the platform’s code is secure, resistant to exploits, and operates as intended. PropiChain’s official listing on CoinMarketCap provides further transparency, allowing investors to track real-time market data, liquidity, and trading volume. PropiChain’s ambitions extend beyond traditional real estate, positioning itself as a leader in metaverse property assessment. The platform seamlessly integrates with virtual real estate markets, offering users opportunities to explore and invest in digital properties within the Propiverse. Investors can take 3D virtual property tours, interact with assets, and acquire metaverse-backed real estate, creating new investment avenues while enhancing user experience. This expansion into digital real estate allows global investors to evaluate properties remotely, redefining accessibility. PropiChain’s Token Presale: A Gateway to High Returns The PropiChain token presale has already generated significant interest, exceeding initial fundraising goals. The first phase saw over $2.9 million raised, with tokens initially priced at $0.004 each. Currently in its second stage, PCHAIN is available at $0.011 per token, with prices expected to rise to $0.023 in the final presale stage before its official listing at $0.032. This progressive increase reflects the growing investor demand and confidence in the project. Early investors stand to benefit the most, with projections indicating a potential 40,000% ROI by Q1 2025. A $1,000 investment at presale prices could see exponential growth, potentially reaching $400,000 upon public release, mirroring the price movement of Shiba Inu during its 2021 surge. As the presale advances, opportunities to acquire PCHAIN tokens at these favorable rates become increasingly limited. Interested investors can participate by registering on the official PropiChain website, selecting their investment amount, and completing their purchase through supported payment methods. Join now.

According to a new Robinhood investment report , the trading app giant saw a 200% year-over-year increase in transaction-based revenues, largely due to crypto. “Total net revenues increased 115% year-over-year to $1.01 billion. Transaction-based revenues increased over 200% year-over-year to $672 million, primarily driven by cryptocurrencies revenue of $358 million, up over 700%, options revenue of $222 million, up 83%, and equities revenue of $61 million, up 144%. Net interest revenues increased 25% year-over-year to $296 million, primarily driven by growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by a lower federal funds rate. Other revenues increased 31% year-over-year to $46 million, primarily due to increased Gold subscription revenues.” Source: Reuters According to a Reuters report , Robinhood’s latest advance into crypto solidifies the trading app as a top rival for the leading US-based crypto exchange Coinbase. Says Paul Marino, Chief Revenue Officer at Themes ETFs (exchange-traded funds), of Robinhood’s success. “The fact that Robinhood had such a surge in revenues across its entire platform is more than just an appetite for risk in the marketplace – it’s also a testament to the adoption of its platform and the fact that the next generation of traders prefer what Robinhood is offering versus competitors.” Coinbase is on schedule to release its own quarterly earnings report later today.

Hyperliquid was last changing hands around $26 per coin, up nearly 9x since its late-November launch. Over the same time period, ETH is down around 25% and Solana is down around 20%. HYPE is the native token of HyperEVM, the innovative layer-1 blockchain that now underpins the Hyperliquid trading protocol. Whilst some are surprised by HYPE’s resilience despite the struggles of the broader crypto market, they shouldn’t be. Really is absurd how immune Hyperliquid is to any market volatility or bleed. $HYPE pic.twitter.com/pS4pMncQRd — McKenna (@Crypto_McKenna) February 13, 2025 Since launching its layer-1 blockchain, Hyperliquid has seen a surge of adoption and usage. Per Messari, Hyperliquid’s trading volumes have surged more than 4x. Hyperliquid’s monthly trading volumes up more than 4x since October Hyperliquid. pic.twitter.com/dFDPqet2lf — Messari (@MessariCrypto) February 7, 2025 HYPE was also the largest crypto airdrop in history and the coin has gained widespread praise for its community (rather than VC) first allocation. One analyst on X noted that HYPE is allocated 69.9% to the community, compared to an average of 36.1% for other networks. Hyperliquid allocated 69.9% of supply to the community, compared to an average of 36.1% for other networks. pic.twitter.com/maVy6fkOOm — Nick G (@NickDGarcia) February 12, 2025 A community-first allocation has likely directly contributed to Hyperliquid’s ground-up adoption, and its growth prospects moving forward look good. Where Next for Hyperliquid? As HYPE crawls higher to probe for a retest of its late-January highs, traders are wondering where the crypto might be headed next. HYPE continues to trade to the north of key short-term moving averages and in a modest uptrend. Macro tailwinds ( such as this week’s hot US inflation data ) continue to keep the broader market in check, but the Hyperliquid price could very well test $28 soon and mount a renewed push toward record high above $35. However, its next major surge may have to wait until broader alt-coin market conditions improve. Tight US financial conditions (US 10-year yields remain elevated around 4.5%) suggest a massive surge like that of 2017 or 2021 is unlikely this year. However, financial conditions aside, there are a lot of bullish events happening for crypto right now as the Trump administration implements its pro-crypto policies. A bitcoin strategic reserve could be coming, as well as a swathe of pro-crypto market legislation that could inject massive liquidity and demand into the space. And as an already established leader, the Hyperliquid price could be set to surge. Its fully diluted valuation of just under $26 billion suggests plenty of room for further upside in the coming years, even if 2025 is a bit of a grind. Could Hyperliquid Overtake Solana? Recent price outperformance has some analysts wondering whether HYPE might someday be able to overtake Solana. After all, the main Solana use case has been for (meme coin) trading, and Hyperliquid is arguably a far superior trading platform. However, while HYPE has shown promising growth with its innovative approach to blockchain technology and community engagement, it still lacks the established developer ecosystem and institutional support that Solana enjoys. Furthermore, even though HYPE might capture significant market interest, Solana’s lead in transaction speed, lower costs, and existing network effects create a high barrier for HYPE to surpass it in market dominance. Best Wallet – A Better Alternative to Consider? Hyperliquid has massive upside potential in the years ahead, but for those looking for even faster gains, and exciting new project called Best Wallet (BEST) could be an even better bet. With over $9 million already raised in just a few months, Best Wallet’s presale is off to a flying start. That strong momentum should come as no surprise given that Best Wallet non-custodial wallet has already amassed over 250,000 users. 250K+ traders are locking in their edge with Best Wallet.

Qubetics’ presale is approaching $13M, proving it’s one of the hottest crypto investments right now with its AI-powered Web3 ecosystem and potential 13525% ROI. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is eyeing a breakout past $300, as its developer adoption and NFT ecosystem continue to expand. And let’s not forget Algorand (ALGO), which just launched a real-time staking model, shaking up the passive income game for investors. With Qubetics’ presale stages closing fast, Solana’s price gaining momentum, and Algorand’s staking innovation attracting attention, these cryptos are positioning themselves for short-term gains and long-term growth. But which one should you bet on? Let’s dive in. Qubetics: The Web3 Aggregator Changing the Game with a Decentralized VPN Qubetics is not just another blockchain project—it’s a Web3 aggregation powerhouse that unifies multiple networks under a single, interoperable ecosystem. One of its most revolutionary applications is its Decentralized VPN (dVPN) , a privacy-focused, censorship-resistant alternative to traditional VPNs. Right now, millions rely on centralized VPN providers like NordVPN and ExpressVPN for online privacy. But here’s the issue: these companies control user data, and in many cases, they’re legally required to hand over browsing activity to governments. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN flips the script by offering a peer-to-peer, blockchain-based solution that: Eliminates centralized control, meaning no one entity can track, censor, or restrict your access. Uses a tokenized bandwidth-sharing system, rewarding users who share their unused bandwidth with TICS tokens. Protects against surveillance and censorship, making it ideal for users in regions with restricted internet access. For example, imagine a journalist in China trying to bypass the Great Firewall. Traditional VPNs are often blocked, but Qubetics’ dVPN operates on a decentralized network, making it nearly impossible to shut down. The same applies to crypto traders in restrictive countries, who need secure, anonymous internet access. With data privacy becoming a global concern, Qubetics’ dVPN is positioned to disrupt the $44B VPN market, making TICS one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term and long-term gains. Qubetics Presale: The Clock is Ticking on This 100x Opportunity! Let’s talk numbers—because Qubetics’ presale isn’t just growing, it’s exploding: Presale Raised: $12.6M+ Current Price: $0.0733 per TICS Total Coins Sold: 470M+ Holders: 19,700+ And here’s the kicker: each presale stage lasts just 7 days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at 12 AM. Now, let’s get real about potential returns. A $1,000 investment at the start of the presale would already be worth $3,406 today. But post-mainnet launch, the gains could be life-changing: $TICS at $1 → 1,262.56% ROI $TICS at $10 → 13,525.66% ROI $TICS at $15 → 20,338.49% ROI With Qubetics’ mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025, time is running out to join the Qubetics presale before the next price increase. Solana: The Blockchain Powerhouse Gearing Up for a $300 Breakout Solana (SOL) has been one of the best-performing altcoins in the past year, and now, it’s flirting with the $300 resistance level. According to Solana Labs, the network has seen a massive influx of developer activity, leading some analysts to believe that Solana could eventually become a trillion-dollar asset. One of Solana’s biggest advantages is its high-speed, low-cost transactions. While Ethereum struggles with high gas fees, Solana offers an alternative that can process thousands of transactions per second for just a few cents. The recent surge in Solana’s ecosystem can be attributed to: Growing adoption of Solana-based NFTs Institutional investors showing renewed interest in SOL Upcoming protocol upgrades to enhance network efficiency With Solana eyeing a potential breakout past $300, it’s one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term gains, especially if the market continues its bullish momentum. Algorand: Revolutionizing Passive Income with Real-Time Staking While most blockchains require users to lock up their assets for months to earn staking rewards, Algorand (ALGO) is flipping the script with its real-time staking model. This innovation allows users to earn passive income instantly, without waiting for staking periods to end. Algorand’s new staking system has several key benefits: Instant payouts, allowing users to earn rewards without delays. No lock-up periods, meaning you can stake and unstake at any time. More flexibility for traders, who can earn rewards while still being able to move funds around. With this groundbreaking staking mechanism, Algorand is attracting a new wave of investors looking for secure, high-yield passive income options. And with staking being a major driver of token adoption, ALGO’s price could see short-term gains as demand increases. Final Thoughts: Which Altcoin Offers the Best Short-Term Gains? With so many hot crypto investments right now, here’s how things stack up: Qubetics (TICS) is the top pick for short-term and long-term growth, with its $13M presale, decentralized VPN, and massive 100x potential. Solana (SOL) is approaching a critical breakout level at $300, making it a strong play for traders looking for quick gains. Algorand (ALGO) is revolutionizing staking rewards, attracting new investors looking for passive income opportunities. If you’re looking for the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term , Qubetics is the standout. With presale prices increasing weekly and the mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, now is the time to join the Qubetics presale before the next price hike. Are you in?

40296412,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=674117,1739488527,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40296412.jpeg,Deutsche Bank-Backed Taurus unveils Solana-based tokenization platform for institutional clients,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/taurus-unveils-solana-based-tokenization/,"Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest financial institution, has partnered with Swiss crypto company Taurus and launched a Solana-based TDX marketplace. The platform is licensed to hold, manage, and stake cryptocurrencies as well as tokenized financial assets for banks, financial institutions, and enterprises. Deutsche Bank’s alliance with Taurus was part of a $65 million Series B funding round, to which key players such as Credit Suisse, Arab Bank Switzerland, and Pictet Group contributed significantly. Taurus integrates Solana for RWA tokenization Jurgen Hofbauer, head of global strategic partnerships at Taurus, noted that the integration between Taurus and Solana stemmed from the demand for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization solutions. He said that the partnership would allow banking and enterprise clients to tokenize their assets, such as equity, debt, funds, CBDCs, structured products, and tokenized deposits at lower costs and simpler processes. Taurus provides enterprise-grade infrastructure to issue cryptocurrency, manage custody, and trade tokenized assets, cryptos, and NFTs. Deutsche Bank has shown interest in crypto for years, and in June 2023, they took a bold step by applying for a digital asset custody license from Germany’s financial regulatory body, BaFin. Alongside institutional clients, retail users can create an account with Taurus and actively participate in capital raises. They can also securely trade digital assets and tokenized securities in compliance with company regulations. Taurus stated that companies can now access primary and secondary markets that serve both retail and professional investors and improve the liquidity of their digital securities. They can also develop their very own trading segments and custom liquidity through auction-based trading. Taurus entices new issuers searching for a trading venue Taurus released a list of new issuers opting for its service as a preferred platform for trading their digital securities. Some popular names include Investis Group, Qoqa, Teylor, Swissroc, la Mobiliere, and SCCF. TDX Head of Product Yann Isola said that Taurus thinks that private markets 2.0 will be digitalized, making a huge difference in buying private security. He is sure that his assumptions are correct, as the demand for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is also the fastest-growing market for digital assets. Meanwhile, Solana has been gaining momentum in the RWA sector, attracting high-profile institutions that are looking to bring traditional financial products on-chain. Franklin Templeton, a leading global asset manager, brought its $594 million Government Money Market Fund (FOBXX) to Solana just yesterday.

40297374,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=674272,1739488855,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40297374.jpeg,Baidu to offer Ernie Bot for free amid DeepSeek challenge,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/baidu-to-offer-ernie-bot-for-free/,"Chinese tech firm Baidu said it would offer access to its flagship artificial intelligence chatbot, Ernie Bot, for free starting April 1. The chatbot, first released just a few months after OpenAI’s ChatGPT, will be available for free to all users across mobile and desktop platforms, the company announced on Thursday, as reported by Reuters . Baidu cited reduced costs and improved technology Baidu said the decision to offer Ernie Bot for free is due to reductions in “inference costs” – basically the costs involved in training large language models (LLMs), including computing power, data storage, and energy use. The Beijing-based company also announced that a new “Deep Search” function, with “enhanced capabilities in thinking, planning, and tool calling” will also be released for free on April 1. After the news, shares of Baidu rose as much as 5.7% in Hong Kong trading on Thursday, according to Google Finance. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has reached a high of HK$119 and low of HK$74. Per Baidu’s data, Ernie Bot had reached a user base of around 430 million users as of November 2024. The chatbot was an early leader in China’s AI industry but it is now facing increasing competition from cheaper and more advanced rivals such as DeepSeek, which provides free AI chatbot services. The Chinese startup recently dropped new models and also claimed the superiority of its models in a technical report. DeepSeek said its model outclassed rivals from OpenAI and Stability AI on rankings for image generation using text prompts. On Wednesday, The Information reported that Baidu was failing to meet Apple’s standards to bring AI to Chinese iPhones. The iPhone maker was reportedly considering working with other firms like Alibaba, it said. And then on Thursday, Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai confirmed during a conference in Dubai that the e-commerce giant is working with Apple. Baidu faces stiff competition Baidu was one of China’s first tech firms to delve deep into the AI sector after OpenAI released its ChatGPT in November 2022. Released in March 2023 , Baidu’s Ernie Bot was up until last month seen as the closest rival to ChatGPT. Baidu has reportedly claimed that its latest version Ernie 4.0 matches OpenAI’s GPT-4 capabilities. However, it has not been rosy for Baidu. According to Asia Financial , one of the tech giant’s biggest challenges has been to achieve widespread adoption in China for the chatbot, although it reportedly handled 1.5 billion daily user queries and interactions. Data from AI product tracker Aicpb.com shows that in terms of user adoption, Baidu’s offerings have been lagging behind domestic competitors like ByteDance’s Doubao chatbot and the latest competitor DeepSeek. According to Asia Financial, the search engine giant’s problems also reflect the intense rivalry within the AI sector in China. The world witnessed a price war last year as the firm and its key competitors Alibaba and ByteDance significantly cut prices of LLMs they use to support generative AI products. Baidu made its Ernie Speed and Ernie Lite free for all business users at that time. In November last year, Baidu revealed that it was shifting its focus to the commercialization of LLM applications. One of its products I-RAG is a text-to-image technology that uses Baidu’s search capabilities to tackle the AI “hallucination” problems. The company also announced the launch of Miaoda, a tool that utilizes its LLM capabilities to generate code and allow users to develop software applications without extensive coding expertise. According to a CNBC report earlier this week, Baidu revealed it is also planning to introduce the next iteration of Ernie Bot in the second half of this year. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the report further indicates that the latest model, Ernie 5, will feature multimodal capabilities which allow it to process and convert between different formats including text, images, audio, and videos.

The buybacks will start from Monday, February 17, and will aim to build a JUP reserve for additional incentives. JUP tokens may get support from the first buybacks, starting Monday, February 17. The Jupiter DEX will use the proceeds from trading fees to build a JUP treasury, which will be locked for three years, per the announcement . we want more more jup. so buybacks start on monday. 50% of all protocol fees will go towards buying $JUP and locking it for 3 years. J4J — Jupiter (🐱, 🐐) (@JupiterExchange) February 13, 2025 The buybacks offset the recent Jupuary airdrop, which led to selling pressure. The buybacks will be announced through a dashboard coming next week. The buybacks will be scheduled at every hour, aiming to bring back as much JUP as possible for a vesting period of three years. The buyback decision comes after the Catstanbul event that burned 3B JUP, reducing the total supply to 7B tokens. Even the burn was not enough to push JUP from its lows, as it was still absorbing selling from the Jupuary airdrop. Jupiter will aggregate fees from all its services and activities, storing all proceeds in a wallet. The fees may be in the form of various tokens, as balances will be transparently posted through the public address. The Jupiter service will include fees from its perpetual futures trades, DCA service, and other routing tools. From the total fees, 50% will be swapped into SOL and USDC for development activities, explained Jupiter cofounder @sssionggg . The rest of the funds will be used for the JUP buybacks, with all purchases going through Jupiter’s own routing. The USDC and SOL will be kept in the team’s multisig wallet, while JUP will be locked in a new vault, the Litter Box, and kept for three years. Jupiter fees got a boost in February Jupiter achieved over $500K in fees for the past 24 hours, ranking 14th among Solana apps and protocols. For the past month, Jupiter DEX fees reached a total of $4.8M. The recent heightened activity saw Jupiter fees rally in February, rising far above their baseline. The current activity may allow the buying of up to $250K in JUP tokens. Currently, all JUP trading is at over $260M in 24 hours, of which $37M is concentrated on Binance. The buying will have a somewhat limited effect on the price, but over time, it may start to make a dent in circulating JUP. The pace of buybacks may vary, as Jupiter may produce a lower or higher level of daily fees. For Jupiter DEX, the spike in swaps happened after January 20, reflecting the launch of Official Trump (TRUMP) and other celebrity tokens. Jupiter total swaps remained higher than the previous baseline. The rally at the beginning of 2025 finally lifted Jupiter activity, after remaining relatively low during the expansion at the end of 2024. Jupiter fees got a boost in February, after the new wave of official celebrity tokens launching on Solana in the past three weeks. | Source: DeFi Llama Jupiter peaked at over 190K daily users on January 21. Currently, swaps and fees remain elevated, despite registering under 20K daily users . The decision for the buyback arrives after Jupiter posted some of its biggest fee gains in history, following peak Solana activity in the past few weeks. The DEX and the aggregator service were among the most widely used on Solana for optimal routing and faster swaps. Following the news, JUP briefly spiked to $0.86, then retreated to $0.83. The token is at the lower end of its three-month range, despite the protocol’s peak performance. JUP has 2.63B tokens in circulation, out of a total supply of 10B. Most JUP is habitually held in reserves and in various forms of staking. The token is expected to break out soon, recovering from the selling pressure of Jupuary tokens. JUP fell from a local peak at $1.22, as new recipients traded in 67% of the newly received tokens. Jupuary aimed to spread JUP to a wider audience, though most turned into sellers. In an optimistic scenario, the buyback would lock over 9% of the JUP supply. The large-scale token burn and the buybacks also face the challenge of mitigating token unlocks. Fewer than 20% of JUP are unlocked, expecting a gradual increase in the available supply. The team’s early allocation and other holdings will start getting unlocked in H2, potentially putting more pressure on the market.

According to a post on X , this updated version will change the NFT market with several new features. OS2 offers a lower marketplace fee, an airdrop of its new SEA token, and adds support for 14 new blockchains. OpenSea OS2 Platform Comes With Lots of Benefits It is worth noting that OpenSea will significantly reduce marketplace fees to just 0.5%. This shift helps make the platform more appealing for creators and collectors by offering a cheaper way to buy, sell, and trade NFTs. Additionally, users will no longer pay swap fees, so they can complete transactions without any extra costs when swapping assets in the NFT market. Another notable improvement in OS2 is the addition of 14 new blockchains, including Sony’s Sonieum and Bored Ape’s Apechain. This gives users more options in picking the blockchain that fits their needs and creating chances for cross-chain compatibility. Furthermore, these new blockchains will work smoothly with the platform, improving the user experience and expanding NFTs available to everyone. Additionally, OpenSea affirmed that SEA token airdrop is coming soon, majorly for United States users. Although an exact date and time haven’t been revealed, this token will be important for the OS2 ecosystem. SEA token will provide new benefits and governance options as the platform develops. Meanwhile, OpenSea will reward its users with this airdrop to show its commitment to the community. OpenSea Sparks Airdrop Buzz Recall that in December 2024, OpenSea sparked excitement and speculation following its registration in the Cayman Islands . Pseudonymous researcher Waleswoosh, affiliated with the Azuki NFT collection, shared OpenSea’s official registration in the Cayman Islands with a screenshot. As such, the news stirred up speculations with the NFT community about an impending token launch and airdrop. Likewise, the news followed OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer’s announcement about the platform revival in November 2024. He promised a revamped version would launch in December but did not provide details. Since then, speculation about a token launch has grown. Many users wonder if this move signals a significant shift for OpenSea and its plans. OpenSea Unveils Seaport 1.6 for Next-Gen NFT Markets Meanwhile, OpenSea collaborated with the Seaport Working Group to release Seaport 1.6 , marking a new era for the NFT marketplace with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem. According to the company, Seaport 1.6 introduced a new feature called Seaport Hooks. Similar to Uniswap v4 Hooks, the Seaport Hook enables developers to create applications that significantly enhance NFTs’ liquidity and utility. Although Seaport serves as a protocol for facilitating peer-to-peer sales of on-chain items, the introduction of Seaport Hooks added a new dimension to NFT governance and functionality.

Qualified U.S. investors will have broad, balanced exposure to the crypto market through the instrument. It is the first approved of several applicants for similar ETFs. The Nasdaq Crypto Index follows nine cryptocurrencies that are weighted according to their market capitalizations. The index represents 75% of the market capitalization of all eligible assets and would add more cryptocurrencies to maintain that level, if necessary. A minimum investment of $100,000 is required. The ETF will have a limited start The ETF (ticker NCIQ) will initially only contain Bitcoin and Ether and will expand the mixture as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves more cryptos for listing. BTC and ETH currently make up 74.81% and 11.51% of the index, respectively. The index is passively managed and rebalanced quarterly. Besides BTC and ETH, the other cryptocurrencies currently on the index, in proportional order, are Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), Avalanche (AVAX) and Uniswap (UNI). NCIQ was listed at $4,827.98 per share at the time of writing, down 1.37% from the previous day. A mixed-crypto ETF is a popular product Brazil-based Hashdex and Nasdaq collaborated on the creation of the index in 2021, and similar products with the full spectrum of listed cryptos are available in several countries. The Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index Europe ETP has amassed over $500 million. The exchange-traded product (ETP) is traded on the Swiss SIX exchange, Deutsche Börse Xetra, Euronext Paris, and Euronext Amsterdam. The Brazilian Stock Exchange B3 lists a Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETP. It is listed in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands as well.

Users can apply Stars to transform a gift into an NFT, boosting its value and making it transferable on-chain. TON chain is growing its NFT activity, almost catching up with Bitcoin ordinals. The activity is based on Telegram gifts, which start out as images but can be minted as NFT. TON is a relatively new hub for NFT and is still niche compared to more established chains. However, TON NFT markets are in their rapid expansion chain, while older networks retain a fraction of their volumes. In the past 24 hours, TON showed its ability to carry an active NFT market . Performance may vary, but the consensus is TON is just starting out with a new wave of NFT. The emergence of a new NFT activity and the minting of collectibles may offset the lowered traffic on TON chain . TON expanded its NFT activity after establishing even closer connections to Telegram. The chat app added Gifts and a new in-app asset, Stars. A gift can still be traded or sent out, but Stars allow it to be minted into an NFT and traded on-chain. Stars can reach all Telegram users, especially those interacting with mini apps. Telegram estimates up to 400M users seek out mini apps and games. Telegram stars make use of the TON blockchain but are also compatible with the Apple Store and Google Appstore. The assets can support creators, make in-app purchases, and are used to trade Gifts as NFT. Upgrading a gift costs a relatively small amount of Stars, which is used to cover network fees. Stars can be bought at $0.016, with fees for purchasing through app stores. Later, the NFT can appreciate and trade on the secondary market. The recent NFT boom may revive interest in TON chain. The native TON token lost some of its positions during the latest market correction, sliding to $3.74. TON chain lost the hype from tap-to-earn games, its meme market was small compared to other chains, and the DeFi sector remained small. The recent digital gift boom and a focus on the Telegram chat app are seen as a source of growth. TON chain also aims to become more transparent and tap the US market. Collectible gifts come with unique features TON chain NFT starts out as regular Telegram gifts, and can be upgraded to collectible through stars. The new collectible item unlocks new characteristics, such as background color, icon, and serial number. There are more than 20 gifts that have additional art and features created, allowing for up to 1,400 unique combinations when minting. TON chain avoided the approach of generating collections, instead seeking out organic growth for its items, as they are used inside the chat app. The organic growth meant gifts and collectibles expanded with activity on Telegram. Gifts took about three months to turn into an NFT sensation and increase their volumes. More than 20M gifts have been minted as collectibles as of January 2025, with more created among the most popular gifts. NFT mints accelerated in the past three months, tapping the Telegram gifts trend. | Source: TON stat GetGems and MarketApp are currently the most active TON NFT markets, reporting hundreds of users each day. Fragment was the most active marketplace in the last 24 hours, carrying $374.8K in sales. The Fragment marketplace also expanded its volumes by 70% in the past 24 hours, as the TON chain NFT usage was just starting out. Anonymous Telegram numbers and Telegram usernames are among the most active collections with the biggest number of holders. TON chain and Telegram aim to break out and reach a mass audience while offering seamless on-chain access. To that end, Telegram will only use TON chain and its native assets, removing other crypto coins and tokens as payments. The TON chain NFT ecosystem is mostly focused on fun and in-chat use cases. As a result, most NFT traded at a low price, with 64 TON for the most expensive and 0.2 TON on average. The goal of the NFT is not high-value collections, but daily turnover and utility. The collectibles can also be sent as minted, letting the end user in the chat unwrap the gift and see the unique features.

Dogecoin’s price is at $0.2587, struggling to maintain essential support as large holders continue to buy. On the other hand, Cardano sees more action from large investors, moving millions of tokens even after a 23% price fall. Analysts think it might recover, yet the future is uncertain. As meme coins and key altcoins face market shifts, the focus is shifting towards Web3 in ecommerce, which shows promise for substantial growth. Web3Bay’s presale is attracting early investors aiming for substantial gains by 2025. This platform integrates blockchain into online shopping, enabling users to manage their transactions and rewards through tokens. With initial pricing and growing interest, Web3Bay is emerging as a potentially lucrative opportunity ahead of its official launch. Why Web3Bay’s Presale Is Generating Buzz Now? Web3Bay is shaping up to be a pivotal player in online shopping by integrating Web3 into ecommerce through a decentralized market. It cuts out intermediaries, reduces fees, and grants buyers and sellers direct control. With blockchain-based transactions and community-led governance, Web3Bay offers a new shopping model where users have full control over their data and finances. As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, such platforms are increasingly in demand. Currently, Web3Bay’s presale is offering early participants a chance to invest before the full rollout. The presale has already accumulated over $1.17 million, selling more than 300 million tokens at a rate of $0.004562625 each. With a predicted presale ROI of 6430%, early investors could see significant advantages. Additionally, Web3Bay provides referral bonuses, rewarding users for bringing new investors. With the fluctuating predictions for major cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, some investors are turning their focus to projects with solid long-term prospects. Web3Bay merges ecommerce and blockchain, providing genuine token utility. As traditional markets keep charging high fees and controlling transactions, Web3Bay’s model is appealing to those seeking a more decentralized option. With presale prices remaining low, the opportunity to invest before it spikes is closing fast. Dogecoin Prediction: What’s Next for DOGE? Dogecoin’s price is currently around $0.2587, facing difficulties in maintaining key support levels after a recent decrease. The meme coin has weakened, dropping below its 50-day and 100-day EMAs. Despite this, there is notable whale activity, with significant holders buying up nearly 750 million DOGE during this low. This shows some confidence from large investors, yet the possibility of a price recovery will depend on overall market conditions and investor interest. A significant development is the launch of Grayscale’s Dogecoin Trust, aiming to bring institutional investors to DOGE. This might boost its adoption; however, technical signs advise caution as DOGE hovers around a vital support area. The future of Dogecoin is still up in the air, with experts looking for signs of either a price surge or further declines. If buying interest increases, DOGE may approach new resistance levels, but currently, the market direction is unclear. ADA Whale Activity: Will Cardano Bounce Back from Its Recent Decline? Cardano is under pressure following a 23% fall in price, yet ADA whale activity indicates that major investors remain active. These large holders are moving millions of ADA, raising hopes for a potential recovery. ADA is now close to its 200-day moving average, with its RSI at its lowest since last October, suggesting the asset might be undervalued. Should the momentum shift, a price recovery could be on the horizon, though the market’s future is still uncertain. Furthermore, Swedish asset manager Virtune has introduced Cardano ETPs on Nasdaq Helsinki, increasing institutional access to ADA. Some analysts view this positively, although caution prevails. Unlike the volatile Dogecoin, ADA’s future movements will rely on its ability to recover important technical levels and attract fresh investment. The Bottom Line Both Dogecoin and ADA are showing mixed signals. DOGE is struggling to hold crucial support yet enjoys robust whale support, whereas ADA’s recent price drop has placed it in potentially undervalued territory, suggesting a chance for recovery. Both cryptocurrencies are seeing institutional interest, yet short-term outcomes are still uncertain. Therefore, some are turning their attention to Web3 in ecommerce, a sector promising real-world applications and substantial growth potential. Web3Bay’s crypto presale has already raised over $1.17 million, and with a projected ROI of 6430%, early participants are locking in their positions before the price increases. As traditional platforms continue to hike fees, Web3Bay is creating a decentralized marketplace that empowers its users. The presale period is limited, and as prices are set to rise, the current low investment threshold will soon disappear.

BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus code has fueled its presale past $194 million, offering structured incentives that ensure steady demand and reduce volatility. Unlike speculative market moves, BlockDAG ’s approach builds long-term value, making it a standout in the sector. Meanwhile, Stacks has gained traction after its founder’s $10 million investment, reinforcing trust in Bitcoin layer solutions. Injective Protocol is also experiencing a surge, with a 25% price increase and rising on-chain activity. However, BlockDAG’s strategic execution and buyer enthusiasm suggest it leads the pack. FINALCALL700 is Supercharging BlockDAG Presale BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus code is driving record-breaking momentum, pushing the presale total to $194 million with over 18.4 billion BDAG coins sold. As a result, offering a 350% bonus has fueled a surge in buyer participation, making it one of the most successful crypto presales of the year. Currently, in batch 27, BDAG is priced at $0.0248, reflecting an ROI of 2,340% since batch 1. Moreover, presale incentives like FINALCALL700 play a crucial role in buyer psychology. By doing so, BlockDAG has created a sense of urgency, attracting both retail buyers and crypto whales looking to maximize early-stage returns. Similarly, this approach mirrors successful launches like Solana and Ethereum, where early buyers saw massive gains due to well-structured presale incentives. What’s more, BlockDAG sets itself apart through strategic execution. Unlike projects that offer arbitrary airdrops, the structured presale phases and timed bonuses ensure steady demand, preventing price volatility before launch. Consequently, this method not only builds buyer confidence but also solidifies BDAG’s position as a sought-after asset. Since the FINALCALL700 bonus is expiring soon, the presale is expected to push past new milestones. As interest continues to grow, BlockDAG’s approach proves that well-planned presale incentives can drive mass adoption and long-term growth. Therefore, buyers are watching closely, knowing that early participation in a strong project can be the difference between minor gains and life-changing returns. Stacks Founder Buys $10 Million in STX Muneeb Ali, the founder of Stacks, has accumulated $10 million worth of STX tokens, reinforcing his belief in the project’s long-term potential. Notably, his significant purchase aligns with Stacks’ ongoing advancements in Bitcoin layer solutions, particularly its role in enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications on Bitcoin. As a result, this move has sparked increased investor confidence, leading to a surge in STX’s price and market interest. Furthermore, Ali’s investment suggests optimism about Stacks’ growth trajectory, especially as Bitcoin layers gain traction in the industry. His deep involvement in the ecosystem, meanwhile, highlights his commitment to expanding Stacks’ capabilities and adoption. As a key figure behind the project, his financial stake could influence broader market sentiment, attracting further investment. Injective Protocol ($INJ) Gains Momentum Injective Protocol ($INJ) is showing bullish signs, with analysts predicting a positive market reaction. Since the start of 2025, $INJ has surged by 25%, climbing from a January 1 low of $9.96 to $12.45 as of February 10. In addition, trading volume has risen by 15% in the past week, reaching approximately $45 million, reflecting growing investor confidence. Meanwhile, Binance remains a key exchange for $INJ, with the $INJ/USDT pair accounting for $30 million in daily trades, followed by $INJ/BTC at $5 million. On-chain activity has also strengthened, with active addresses increasing by 10% to 12,500 and transaction volume rising by 8% to $100 million. These metrics, therefore, highlight increasing adoption and usage, reinforcing the asset’s potential for further gains. Strategic Growth Positions BlockDAG Ahead As buyer interest intensifies, BlockDAG, Stacks, and Injective Protocol continue to gain momentum. BlockDAG’s structured presale incentives, surpassing $194 million, set it apart by maintaining demand while preventing excessive volatility. Meanwhile, Stacks benefits from its founder’s $10 million investment, reinforcing confidence in Bitcoin layer solutions. Injective Protocol’s rising trading volume and price surge highlight increasing adoption. While all three projects show promise, BlockDAG’s carefully planned execution and investor enthusiasm indicate it holds a stronger position for long-term growth. With interest growing, its presale success underscores its potential as a more stable and strategically positioned investment opportunity.

This was primarily due to a massive increase in cryptocurrency transaction fees in the current quarter, which stood at $358 million, a 491% increase from the previous quarter. The increase in crypto revenue also brought a new interest in retail investing in digital assets. Robinhood’s highest cryptocurrency trading revenue of $233M was recorded in 2021, mainly due to DOGE trading. This notional volume was established in Q4 2024, and it was 400% higher than the volumes recorded in the previous year. Robinhood expanded its offerings, adding 7 new cryptocurrencies for its users in the United States, as well as Ethereum staking in the European Union. This decision reflects its general goals of targeting a steadily expanding audience of retail and institutional investors in cryptocurrencies. Strong financial performance and market response Notably, the company reported a net income of $916 million, well above analyst expectations. This impacted the company’s stock price, leading to a 7% increase in its shares to $60 in after-hours trading after the earnings report. The shares’ value has been soaring since the beginning of 2024, registering a 360% increase. The Assets Under Custody (AUC) also grew 88% to $193 billion yearly. This was attributed to steady net deposits and higher equities and cryptocurrency valuations. In June 2024, Robinhood announced plans to acquire global crypto exchange Bitstamp, pending regulatory approvals. The acquisition is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2025, positioning Robinhood for deeper institutional market penetration. Additionally, Robinhood revealed in June 2024 that it planned to buy global crypto exchange Bitstamp, pending regulatory approvals. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025, allowing Robinhood to penetrate the institutional markets better. Robinhood also expanded its trading products beyond cryptocurrencies. The company launched index options for all users and in-app futures trading, offering products across stocks, energy, currencies, metals, and crypto. In addition, Robinhood Legend, the desktop platform for active traders launched in October 2024, has seen the addition of nearly 30 new indicators and expanded to the crypto side. Regulatory challenges While Robinhood’s Q4 was solid financially, the company faced regulatory headwinds. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) ordered Robinhood Derivatives to suspend its sports event contracts. As a result, it decided to stop the rollout of the Pro Football Championship market that it had opened to a limited number of users. In addition, the company said it is committed to cooperating with regulators to make sure it is compliant. Robinhood’s reported performance comes amid a broader crypto market rally. Several altcoins posted major gains, while Bitcoin hit $100,000 for the first time in Q4.

As more investors enter the presale, Lightchain AI is poised to become a significant player in the upcoming wave of blockchain advancements. In this article, we delve into why these sequential buys are occurring in Lightchain AI's presale and what it signifies for blockchain's future. Reasons Behind the Sequential Purchases The series of purchases within the Lightchain AI environment is forming a distinct pattern, driven by the project's unique technological approach and market positioning.

As Solana and XRP investors observe the growing momentum behind Lightchain AI, some are opting to diversify their investment portfolios. The project's commitment to scalable, AI-powered solutions offers a compelling alternative that could capture a portion of the market. While Solana and XRP are established forces, the arrival of a technologically sophisticated competitor like Lightchain AI is expected to influence investor strategies and expand the competitive field.

As Bitcoin remains at the forefront of the DeFi landscape, innovative projects like Mutuum Finance are emerging to broaden the spectrum of opportunities. Currently in its presale stage, Mutuum Finance introduces a novel approach to decentralized lending and borrowing, allowing investors to engage in a burgeoning sector poised for further achievements in 2025. Introducing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized platform crafted to streamline lending and borrowing in the crypto realm, making these processes both simple and rewarding. It operates with two distinctive markets aimed at fulfilling varied user demands: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C market leverages automated smart contracts to securely and efficiently manage transactions, simplifying user participation. Meanwhile, the P2P market enables direct user interaction, offering enhanced flexibility and access to a wider variety of assets, including newly introduced or niche tokens. For those supplying assets, Mutuum Finance provides an avenue to earn passive income by depositing assets like USDT into liquidity pools, allowing their investments to grow over time. Borrowers can utilize their crypto assets, such as Ethereum, as collateral to obtain funds without needing to liquidate their holdings. For instance, by depositing Ethereum, a borrower can secure a portion of its value in USDT for personal or investment purposes. Now is potentially the perfect moment to invest in MUTM tokens, which are currently available at the lowest presale price of $0.01. Experts forecast that this token will increase by over 1000% upon launch, with an expected price of $0.06 or more. This projected growth is fueled by the platform's strong emphasis on utility, particularly its lending and borrowing functions, alongside the planned beta platform launch that coincides with the token release. These initiatives are anticipated to boost demand and adoption significantly, making Mutuum Finance a compelling investment prospect in the DeFi arena. Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself through its tangible benefits and a clearly outlined growth strategy. For those eager to enter the DeFi market early, MUTM offers a promising chance to invest in a project with substantial success potential. The tokenomics of Mutuum Finance are thoughtfully structured to encourage growth and reward community involvement. With a total supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens, the distribution plan ensures the platform's sustainability and attractiveness to investors. A significant share, 45.5%, is designated for the presale, providing early investors access to MUTM tokens at an attractive entry price. An additional 10% is allocated for liquidity mining and incentives, rewarding both suppliers and borrowers who actively support the platform's ecosystem. These incentives promote liquidity and engagement, which are vital for the platform's long-term success. Moreover, 10% of the tokens are reserved to foster ecosystem growth and support developer contributions, ensuring ongoing innovation and expansion. Remaining allocations are carefully distributed for partnerships, platform liquidity, and community incentives. This well-balanced token distribution not only encourages participation but also lays a solid foundation for price stability and growth, making MUTM an appealing option for investors. With a clear focus on utility and scalability, Mutuum Finance's tokenomics aim to deliver sustainable value to its users and stakeholders. Bitcoin DeFi TVL Rockets by 2,000% in 2024 Bitcoin-centric decentralized finance (DeFi) experienced an extraordinary surge in 2024, with total value locked (TVL) increasing by a staggering 2,000%. This explosive growth was spurred by significant advancements such as the introduction of Bitcoin staking platforms and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. These developments not only bolstered investor confidence but also highlighted Bitcoin's growing role beyond its traditional use as a store of value, reinforcing its standing in the DeFi sector. The rise in TVL highlights the escalating demand for Bitcoin-driven financial solutions. With projects launching innovative protocols and increased capital pouring into Bitcoin-native DeFi platforms, the network is demonstrating its ability to compete with other ecosystems like Ethereum. The blend of technological advancement, rising prices, and institutional interest positions Bitcoin DeFi as a pivotal area to monitor as we head into 2025. Bitcoin and Mutuum Finance are each shaping the future of decentralized finance in their distinct ways. Bitcoin's record-setting DeFi growth in 2024 underscores its expanding utility and investor trust, while Mutuum Finance introduces fresh opportunities with its practical lending and borrowing features. As these platforms develop, they present exciting prospects for those eager to engage in the next wave of crypto innovation.

40297862,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=695681,1739493037,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Dogecoin Breakout Coming? Analyst Identifies Key Price Level,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-breakout-key-price-level/,"In his latest technical breakdown posted on X, analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) highlighted a pivotal threshold on Dogecoin’s daily chart. According to Kevin, reclaiming the $0.28 region on a weekly close—and then showing clear follow-through—could set Dogecoin on a path toward retesting its all-time highs. He notes: “Get back above the .28 cents level on Dogecoin on a weekly close and show follow through and my thought process is we attack the highs not too long after that. I have been allocating into a spot long at .25 cents on DOGE in the Patreon via the Trading Portfolio (separate from long term bag). Ready for either outcome. Let’s send this thing higher.” When Will The Dogecoin Correction End? The chart highlights a well-known metric called the Bitcoin Bull Market Support Band, applied here to Dogecoin, which consists of the 20-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Although this indicator was originally developed for Bitcoin, many analysts extend it to altcoins to determine whether the broader trend is bullish or bearish. In Dogecoin’s current setup, this band hovers in the $0.282–$0.286 range. Price dipped below it last week and now facing a key resistance zone between $0.27 and $0.29. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready For A $2.43 Rally? Elliott Wave Says Yes Beyond the price levels, Kevin also points to two momentum studies. On the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI), the yellow line has crossed above its accompanying moving average, suggesting that bearish pressure may be easing. The RSI hovers near 38, which is above a notable support region around 27. Notably, the yellow RSI line is now back above its pink moving average (MA) line. According to Kevin, this may be an early sign of a shift in sentiment if follow-through buying continues. Another important technical feature is the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), which is nearing a bullish crossover. The MACD line is approaching the signal line, and if this crossover is confirmed, it could generate positive momentum for Dogecoin. Kevin marks this as a “Pending Daily Bullish MACD Cross,” which, if validated, would add further credence to the bullish outlook. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holding Strong—Analyst Says $4 Rally Could Be Next In the larger scheme, the chart underscores that a firm weekly close above $0.28 is the key catalyst. This level aligns with the Bull Market Support Band, and if reclaimed decisively, could accelerate Dogecoin’s push toward mid-$0.30s or beyond, provided broader market conditions remain conducive. In another post, Kevin explained: “I have been saying it for weeks now while the rest have said its altseason. We are in a major correctional period. These periods happen in markets in case you never noticed. Crypto is very driven off the macro, especially altcoins. We want to hold these levels on Total Market Cap if we want to feel good about this market otherwise the correction can go deeper. In the mean time Chill out. Still billions in liquidity up to $111K on BTC that will be taken eventually.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.25.

The plan targets countries that enforce non-tariff trade barriers, including value-added taxes (VATs), which the administration believes create an unfair advantage for foreign businesses. The US Trade Representative’s office has been tasked with reviewing these policies to determine which countries will face retaliatory tariffs. Trump also announced that countries will not be allowed to ship goods to the US through third-party nations to bypass these tariffs. “THREE GREAT WEEKS, PERHAPS THE BEST EVER, BUT TODAY IS THE BIG ONE; RECIPROCAL TARIFFS!!!,” Trump had posted on Truth Social. Commerce Secretary to oversee tariff studies At the Oval, Trump confirmed that Howard Lutnick, his Commerce Secretary, will lead the effort to determine the tariff levels for each affected country. “We want a level playing field,” Trump said, emphasizing that the US will no longer tolerate one-sided trade deals. Lutnick expects a full report by April 1, after which tariffs will be implemented accordingly. Shortly after the announcement, Trump took to Truth Social, saying that the plan would also address foreign subsidies and nonmonetary trade barriers that disadvantage US industries. “America has helped many Countries throughout the years, at great financial cost. It is now time that these Countries remember this, and treat us fairly,” Trump wrote. The reciprocal tariffs come on the heels of Trump’s previous trade measures, including tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, along with duties on steel and aluminum imports. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico remain on hold, as both countries have agreed to step up efforts against illegal border crossings and drug trafficking. European Union and global markets react European nations are definitely next on Trump’s list. He has repeatedly criticized the US trade deficit with Europe and has called out the EU for not purchasing enough American cars and farm equipment. European leaders, though, have warned that any US tariffs will be met with retaliation. Markets responded cautiously to Trump’s reciprocal tariff plan. During the day’s session, the S&P 500 rose 1.04%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.77%, hitting session highs exactly four times. The 10-year US Treasury yield dropped nine basis points, while Australian and New Zealand bond yields also declined early Friday. The US dollar fell 0.7% against its developed-market peers, while the yen surged 1.1% in Thursday trading. The Canadian dollar hit a new high for the year, as investors speculated on how Trump’s tariff plan might affect North American trade. The timing of Trump’s signing event came just hours before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to visit the White House. India has long faced accusations of imposing restrictive trade policies on US goods, and Modi’s meeting with Trump was expected to address the issue. Whether India will seek exemptions or retaliate remains unclear.

With its presale currently active, the project presents an early chance for those interested in leveraging its lending services and vision for a fully backed stablecoin. Analysts are hopeful about its future, forecasting notable expansion for the MUTM token. Meanwhile, Cardano's research has underscored the blockchain's growing influence in solving real-world issues. Emphasizing areas such as traceability, authenticity, and sustainability, Cardano illustrates the practical application of blockchain technology in supporting global industries. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): An Overview Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that empowers users to participate as both lenders and borrowers. It offers a straightforward platform for users to deposit their crypto assets into specific liquidity pools, earn interest, and borrow against collateral. By prioritizing transparency, adaptability, and security, Mutuum Finance aims to establish a proficient ecosystem for handling digital assets. Lenders can contribute their cryptocurrencies to Mutuum’s liquidity pools, earning returns based on the utilization rate of the pool. Borrowers can tap into these funds by securing collateral that exceeds the loan amount. This overcollateralization safeguards the platform's stability and reduces risk for users. Mutuum Finance functions with two main lending frameworks: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C framework, smart contracts oversee the lending and borrowing operations automatically. Users can lend or borrow assets without needing to directly connect with someone else. This setup ensures transactions are efficient and secure, appealing to users who prefer minimal involvement. Conversely, the P2P framework enables direct interaction between users. Borrowers and lenders can negotiate terms, offering flexibility not found in the P2C market. Moreover, the P2P market supports assets not usually available in the P2C market, like memecoins or new tokens, broadening opportunities for users with particular interests. Mutuum structures its lending markets around specific liquidity pools for each supported cryptocurrency. Lenders earn interest by placing assets into these pools, obtaining mtTokens as proof of their deposits. These mtTokens automatically reflect accrued interest, streamlining the process for users. Borrowers can obtain funds from these pools by securing collateral that surpasses the loan value, ensuring overcollateralization. The platform assigns a Loan-To-Value (LTV) ratio to each asset, determining its borrowing capacity based on liquidity and volatility. Borrowers have the option to repay loans partially or entirely at any time, as long as they maintain a suitable collateral-to-debt ratio to prevent liquidation. For Lenders: A user deposits 1 ETH into a Mutuum liquidity pool and gets back 1 mtETH token. Over time, the mtETH token accumulates interest according to the pool’s utilization rate. When the user decides to redeem their mtETH after several months, they might withdraw 1.05 ETH, including the interest earned (subject to current interest rates). For Borrowers: An investor holds 2 ETH and wishes to borrow 1 ETH. They use their 2 ETH as collateral in Mutuum, ensuring the loan is overcollateralized. Upon full repayment of the loan, the borrower can reclaim their collateral. By integrating its P2C and P2P markets with strong lending and borrowing frameworks, Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself as a versatile and secure DeFi platform. This configuration not only addresses diverse user requirements but also supports a dynamic and sustainable ecosystem for ongoing growth. Cardano Study Showcases Blockchain Advancements A recent study by the Cardano Foundation has illuminated the expanding impact of blockchain technology, particularly focusing on initiatives within the Cardano ecosystem. The analysis covered over 580 projects, revealing that a majority aim to tackle real-world problems in areas like traceability, authenticity, and sustainability. Approximately 55% of these projects concentrate on authenticity, providing secure verification for identities and data, while 30% focus on traceability to create transparent records for digital and physical asset verification. This underscores Cardano's capability to address significant global issues with practical blockchain solutions. Cardano's international presence is also evident, with 70% of its projects targeting global markets. The platform’s scalability and adaptability have made it a preferred option for enterprises and developers worldwide. By supporting a wide range of applications, Cardano is driving the role of blockchain in resolving industry challenges, from ensuring supply chain transparency to promoting environmental efforts. This growth not only highlights the platform's adaptability but also its potential to effect meaningful change across multiple sectors. Reasons to Consider Investing in Mutuum Finance by 2025 Mutuum Finance presents investors with the opportunity to enter at the most affordable price during its presale phase, with MUTM tokens available for just $0.01. The project's strong emphasis on practical utilities, including its decentralized lending platform and plans for a fully collateralized stablecoin, sets it up for substantial growth. For those seeking significant returns and a promising early-stage investment, Mutuum Finance emerges as an attractive option.

The acknowledgment specifically applies to Grayscale’s product, which will convert its existing XRP Trust into a fully tradable ETF on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca. Grayscale launched its XRP Trust years ago, similar to its Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts. A conversion to an ETF would provide greater liquidity and accessibility, potentially increasing demand for XRP among traditional investors. XRP ETF filing moves to the next stage But the acknowledgment does not mean an automatic approval, nor does it guarantee that the SEC will definitely greenlight the XRP ETF in the future. But it is still a pretty big deal because the SEC, under its former chairman Gary Gensler, refused to even engage with altcoin ETF applications. Just a few months ago, Solana ETF applications were withdrawn after the SEC and Gary refused to even discuss them with the public. The acknowledgment is just the first step in the SEC’s approval process. According to the 19b-4 form posted on Thursday, the next stage is public comment. The filing will be published in the Federal Register, after which the public has 21 days to submit feedback. Following this period, the SEC will decide whether to approve, reject, or extend its review by opening more proceedings. This development doesn’t just affect Grayscale. Bitwise Invest, 21Shares, Canary Funds, and WisdomTree Funds, have also filed for XRP ETFs, though their applications are yet to be officially acknowledged by the agency. These companies submitted their applications after Grayscale, so their filings will be reviewed separately once acknowledged by the SEC. The SEC has also acknowledged Dogecoin ETF filings, which would have been unthinkable under the previous administration. Historically, altcoin ETF applications have either been rejected or withdrawn soon after submission. Meanwhile, President Trump has picked the crypto-loving Paul Atkins to be his SEC chairman, though he is yet to be confirmed, so we got Mark Uyeda as the acting chairman until he does, ideally by May.

Van de Poppe tells his 773,600 followers on the social media platform X that blockchain oracle Chainlink ( LINK ) appears bullish against Bitcoin ( BTC ) and could double in price. According to the widely followed analyst, the Chainlink/US dollar pair could subsequently appreciate by around 169% from the current level. “LINK forms a higher low, which indicates that we’re likely into a new uptrend. My first target is around 2x in BTC value, which should equal around $40 – $50.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X LINK is trading at $18.60 at time of writing. Next up is the native token of the layer-one blockchain project Sui ( SUI ). The widely followed analyst says Sui could go up by around 61% from the current level after bouncing off a major support zone. “SUI is an example of what the markets are likely going to do. It had a high-time frame support test of the order block around $2.50. Massive interest and price jumped up pretty quickly, to be followed with a strong green weekly candle. I think that we’ll see a new high on this soon.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X SUI is trading at $3.32 at time of writing, down by approximately 38% from the all-time high of $5.35.

Chainlink (LINK) is witnessing an increase in large-scale transactions, indicating a potential upturn, while Avalanche (AVAX) is under strong selling pressure with concerns it might fall below $20. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) is gaining attention this February as it pioneers a decentralized marketplace for e-commerce, posing a significant disruption in a trillion-dollar industry. Chainlink and Avalanche are swayed by traditional market cycles and sentiments, whereas Web3Bay introduces practical applications with substantial adoption prospects. Having raised over $1.1 million and sold 295 million tokens during its presale, Web3Bay stands out not merely as a speculative investment but as a transformative approach to digital commerce, forecasting a 4,200% return on investment upon its launch, making it the prime investment option among the three. Chainlink (LINK) Prices Spike with Whale Activity Chainlink’s price is catching the market’s eye as transactions from major holders reach a 14-month peak, with 1,659 transfers over $100,000 recorded in one day. Data from Santiment shows active wallets have reached 9,531, a four-week high. This spike in significant transactions typically precedes a price increase as institutional investors prepare for anticipated market movements. Despite a recent 20% decrease, Chainlink’s price is stabilizing between its 50-day moving average at $22.76 and the 200-day MA at $15.88. Historical data suggests that substantial buys during a downturn often lead to robust recoveries. Market experts remain optimistic, predicting a rise to $32 by February, $41 by March, and potentially hitting $48 by May, which would represent an 88% growth from its current position. Avalanche (AVAX) Falls Below $27 – Could It Hit $20? Avalanche’s value has dipped below $27, continuing its decline as bearish trends strengthen. Over the past week, AVAX has seen an 18.3% fall, with a further 3.6% decrease in the last 24 hours, reducing its market capitalization to under $11 billion. Analysts caution that continued selling might push the token toward the $20 mark. Technical indicators point to increased downside risks. AVAX has slipped below its crucial 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $28.91. The Trend Strength Index (TSI) stands at -0.89, and a significant drop in the 20-day EMA reinforces the negative momentum. If AVAX does not recover above this threshold, the next key support is projected near $19.55. Web3Bay: February 2025’s Top Crypto Pick Web3Bay (3BAY) is making waves as February’s leading crypto investment by transforming e-commerce through its decentralized platform. Unlike traditional platforms such as Amazon and eBay, which enforce high fees and central control, Web3Bay allows direct transactions between buyers and sellers on the blockchain, cutting out intermediaries and slashing costs. Web3Bay leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure, tamper-proof transactions and is governed by its token holders through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), reinventing the way we think about online shopping. The Web3Bay presale is proving highly successful, raising over $1.1 million and selling 295 million tokens. Currently, in Stage 4, the token price is $0.00456, with a projected launch price of $0.1959, which could yield a return of 4,200% for early investors. Web3Bay also offers staking rewards, giving token holders a way to earn passive income and enjoy reduced transaction fees. As the global e-commerce market exceeds $7 trillion, Web3Bay is poised to capitalize on this with significant real-world applications. As crypto continues to gain mainstream acceptance, 3BAY emerges as a critical investment for February. Its robust growth potential, practical utility, and strong investor interest position it as the most attractive crypto presale currently. Web3Bay Dominates as the Top Market Pick While Chainlink’s whale activity suggests a possible price increase, its value fluctuates significantly. Avalanche contends with vital resistance points and could see further declines if sentiments do not improve. In contrast, Web3Bay promises more than speculative value—it represents a growing ecosystem with long-term expansion potential. Featuring staking rewards, decentralized governance, and real-world application, Web3Bay transcends being merely a speculative investment. For investors seeking a cryptocurrency with substantial growth prospects and practical applications, Web3Bay is a must-consider during its crypto presale . Although LINK and AVAX have their merits, Web3Bay distinguishes itself as the prime crypto investment for February, offering early participants a chance at significant returns before its official release.

Will 1Fuel Actually Be One Of The Biggest Risers In 2025?,https://timestabloid.com/will-1fuel-actually-be-one-of-the-biggest-risers-in-2025/,"Ripple’s price action is showing signs of hesitation, with traders stuck in an indecisive back-and-forth that could see its price slipping below $2. Meanwhile, a new name is making waves in the crypto market: digital assets powerhouse 1Fuel . Currently in its presale, 1Fuel is already gaining momentum, with experts predicting a potential 100x surge in 2025. But why is XRP struggling, and what makes 1Fuel the one to watch? Ripple’s Price struggles with uncertain market sentiment XRP’s price action has been underwhelming, stuck in a narrow trading range between $2 and $3. After breaking below its 100-day moving average at $2.1, Ripple XRP briefly rebounded, clearing out over-leveraged positions. However, selling pressure at $2.7 has left the token in a choppy sideways movement with little volatility. Without a clear breakout, Ripple’s price looks set to consolidate further. Buyers and sellers are contesting the next move, but the lack of strong demand suggests that Ripple may soon drop toward $1.80. As liquidity zones get tested, traders are likely to stay cautious until a definitive trend emerges. For now, cold storage solutions might be the best way for long-term Ripple XRP holders to ride out the uncertainty. 1Fuel: The next breakout token that fixes crypto’s biggest pain points While Ripple XRP faces hesitation, 1Fuel is gearing up for an explosive debut. This cutting-edge technology is addressing cross-chain transactions, one of the main issues with cryptocurrency. Trading between blockchains is now a headache. Moving money is a frustrating experience because of multiple wallets, gas costs, and slow transfers. With one-click swaps, 1Fuel resolves this issue and does away with the requirement for intricate bridges or additional network costs. Consider the possibility of being able to purchase any token on any blockchain without having to worry about delays or conversions. That’s what 1Fuel offers. Investors are paying attention because it is a game-changer. Early purchasers are protecting their tokens before the unavoidable spike, with a presale price of just $0.012. Analysts predict that 1Fuel could easily 100x once it debuts, putting it as one of the top digital assets to watch in 2025. Why 1Fuel’s presale is the smartest move right now Beyond its seamless cross-chain transactions, 1Fuel offers real incentives for investors. Staking rewards of up to 30% APR provide passive income, while its upcoming P2P exchange will eliminate intermediaries, making transactions faster and more secure. Security is also a top priority, with built-in cold storage solutions ensuring that investors’ assets remain protected at all times. As other tokens struggle with market volatility, 1Fuel is building a robust ecosystem designed for mass adoption. Because of this, analysts think 1Fuel will soon rank among the most sought-after digital assets on the market. Demand will soar as more investors realize that the presale won’t last forever. Final thoughts: XRP or 1Fuel? Ripple’s future remains uncertain as traders struggle to find confidence in its next move. With the price likely to dip to $1.80, investors might start looking elsewhere for higher potential gains. 1Fuel, on the other hand, is solving real problems, making cross-chain transactions effortless and rewarding early adopters in the process. Don’t miss out on securing your 1Fuel tokens at the lowest price. Join the presale today and be part of the future of seamless, secure crypto transactions!

The post included an official document from Crypto.com Derivatives North America (CDNA) confirming that XRP will be listed on February 14, 2025. Rietveld emphasized the potential market impact, stating that the listing could drive billions in trading volume . BREAKING: The largest North American exchange will list #XRP on February 14th, driving billions in daily trading volume! pic.twitter.com/fPD6tmV935 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) February 13, 2025 Crypto.com Expanding Options For XRP Crypto.com is the largest North American crypto exchange, and Rietveld suggested that its decision to list XRP would have a substantial effect on trading volume. His statement aligns with the growing influence of Crypto.com, which has seen a surge in market activity over recent months. The attached image shows that CDNA has formally notified the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of its intention to list a new type of financial product: an event contract based on the XRP cryptocurrency. In the letter dated February 12, 2025, CDNA submitted a product certification to the CFTC under Regulation 40.2(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act. This regulation allows exchanges to self-certify certain products for listing and trading. The XRP Crypto Event Contract The proposed “XRP Crypto Event Contract” would likely be a type of derivative that pays out based on whether a specific XRP-related event occurs. While the exact nature of these events is not yet public, they could be tied to price movements, network milestones, or similar events. CDNA aims to list the XRP event contract for trading on or after February 14, 2025. This move signals Crypto.com’s continued expansion into the derivatives market and its commitment to offering a diverse range of cryptocurrency-based financial products. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Crypto.com’s Growing Influence In recent months, Crypto.com has experienced a substantial increase in trading activity. A Coindesk report from October showed that the exchange’s monthly spot trading volume escalated from $34 billion in July 2024 to $134 billion by September 2024. The exchange captured a significant share of North America’s total crypto trading volume during that period, and this surge has positioned it ahead of competitors such as Coinbase and Kraken. Potential Market Impact XRP’s listing on a major exchange like Crypto.com is expected to boost liquidity and increase daily trading volumes. With many bullish signals surrounding the digital asset, this listing has bolstered the positive sentiment in the market. Historically, new exchange listings have led to heightened market activity. Bulls are flocking into the XRP market , and the digital asset could experience an exciting run in the immediate future. Rietveld’s post has drawn significant attention, and investors will be watching closely to see how XRP’s price responds after February 14.

However, its weekly trajectory tells a more dynamic story—while SPX6900 remains -28.93% below its recent all-time high of $1.01, it has rebounded 30.00% from its 7-day low of $0.5546.

With community-driven momentum and speculative hype fueling its rise, the TRUMP Meme Coin could continue to experience sharp fluctuations as traders seek to capitalize on its rapid gains.

40299814,https://timestabloid.com/?p=57204,1739496657,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,True Traders From The Beginning Of Solana & Cardano Have Moved Into 1Fuel (OFT) But What Is It?,https://timestabloid.com/true-traders-from-the-beginning-of-solana-cardano-have-moved/,"The shift toward 1Fuel’s presale is undeniable The tides of the crypto investment world are shifting once again, and those who’ve been in the game long enough know when to move. Cardano and Solana whales, who have weathered the highs and lows of these blockchains, are making a bold pivot toward 1Fuel. And for good reason. 1Fuel’s presale is already gaining momentum and is tipped to surge 100x in 2025 . Read on to find out why investors are locking in early. Solana whales make strategic moves Solana has been a force in crypto investment, with lightning-fast transactions and a robust community. Even the most devoted SOL investors recognize the significance of grasping fresh possibilities. Recent whale behavior in the Solana market supports this opinion. Two major Solana wallet addresses have resurfaced after months of inactivity, executing trades worth over $18.6 million. While this shows confidence in Solana’s future, it also signals a key transition: seasoned traders are looking beyond the old giants for the next major opportunity. The price of SOL hovers around $200, struggling against resistance levels. Despite technical indicators showing resilience, the excitement that once fueled Solana’s meteoric rise has settled into consolidation mode. For traders who thrive on momentum and high-growth potential, this is a cue to explore emerging alternatives like 1Fuel. Cardano’s uncertain future drives investors toward new opportunities Cardano, often praised for its research-driven development, has long been an investor favorite. But let’s face it, ADA has struggled to break out of its long-term resistance levels. The $1 target remains elusive, and while recent breakouts hint at potential, many traders are losing patience. ADA currently trades at around $0.78, showing signs of crypto investment volatility. While bullish traders anticipate a push past $0.86, the reality is that Cardano has yet to deliver the explosive growth that early investors hoped for. The market remains cautious, and traders who once championed ADA are now looking for a project with stronger growth potential. That’s where 1Fuel enters the conversation. Why Solana whales are choosing 1Fuel over established giants The core issue with Solana and Cardano isn’t their technology, it’s their stagnation. Solana is consolidating, and Cardano is struggling to break key resistance levels. Meanwhile, 1Fuel is establishing itself as a game changer, addressing the most pressing issue in cryptocurrency today: cross-chain fragmentation. For years, cryptocurrency enthusiasts have envisioned a seamless, linked blockchain world. However, the reality is a collection of disconnected networks, each with its own environment, wallets, and transaction fees. 1Fuel is set to solve this by offering a truly decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol. Imagine moving assets between chains effortlessly, without the need for clunky bridges or excessive fees. That’s what 1Fuel promises. Beyond its technical innovation, the project’s presale is already drawing serious investor interest. With expectations of a 100x surge in 2025 , early adopters know they’re positioning themselves for massive gains before the wider market catches on. The shift is happening: veteran traders are moving their capital into 1Fuel, recognizing its potential to reshape crypto transactions. The future belongs to 1Fuel The writing is on the wall: traders who built their portfolios on Solana and Cardano are now betting big on 1Fuel. With a revolutionary approach to solving cross-chain liquidity issues and a presale that’s gaining serious traction, the opportunity is clear. The crypto world has been waiting for a seamless, interoperable future, and 1Fuel is here to deliver it. Don’t miss out on the chance to secure your 1Fuel tokens at the lowest price. Join the presale today and be part of the future of secure, cross-chain cryptocurrency transactions!

His response sheds light on Railgun, a privacy pool mechanism that seeks to allow financial privacy while implementing measures to curb rampant fraud. On Feb. 12, an attacker exploited a rounding precision issue at zkLend, which is a money-market protocol in Starknet, stolen amounting to 3,600 ETH, equivalent to $9.5m at that time. The hacker increased the “lending_accumulator” by continuously depositing and then withdrawing wstETH and then transferring the assets to Ethereum. Further, when transferring the stolen amount to a privacy-focused protocol, Railgun, which uses zero-knowledge proof, the attacker was unable to manage the assets. The Private Proofs of Innocence function in Railgun also screened out illicit funds from getting into the privacy pool. The stolen assets are still in the hacker’s wallet, which has been marked by blockchain scanners. In a post on Thursday, Buterin addressed Railgun’s response, stating that it is one of the best demonstrations of privacy pools working as intended. He also pointed out that the system did not allow the execution of unlawful operations without leading to surveillance or backdoors. Privacy pools as a compliance solution The incident illustrates the current concern over the application of regulation to privacy-enhancing technology based on blockchain. Recently, there has been an effort to shut down crypto mixers, including Tornado Cash and Bitcoin Fog, which are strictly related to money laundering. In contrast to other mixers, Railgun follows a compliance-based approach that allows it to block any fund linked to illegitimate activities. The zkLend’s team tried to contact a hacker and make a deal to keep 10% of the stolen money and return the rest. However, the hacker has yet to respond. “To the hacker: We understand that you are responsible for today’s attack on zkLend. You may keep 10% of the funds as a whitehat bounty, and send back the remaining 90%, or 3,300 ETH to be exact, to this Ethereum address: 0xCf31e1b97790afD681723fA1398c5eAd9f69B98C” zkLend Currently, security personnel from StarkWare, the Starknet Foundation, Binance Security, and other analytical firms are monitoring this address. Buterin made the comments after Threat Researcher Vladimir S. reported that the hackers who hacked zkLend aimed at laundering them through Railgun. The protocol raised the alarm and rejected the transaction, thereby proving the efficiency of the protocol in curbing misuse. The zkLend hack exposes the timely issue of privacy and compliance in the decentralized space. While transparency is useful for security purposes, exposing stolen funds to the public ledger could create a problem for ordinary wallet holders regarding their financial anonymity. Buterin has advocated using privacy tools that do not breach compliance standards. In 2023, he coauthored the research paper on Privacy Pool, a framework that will facilitate private transactions while discouraging criminal activities. For the developers who do not support Railgun’s filtering system, Buterin suggests that they establish privacy pools with different screening conditions. However, these options must be backed by the community that has robust protection of anonymity in place.

This bullish sign is reflected through PEPE’s projected breakout of the 800 EMA, which is a sign of bullish reversal. This bullish case for PEPE was first noted by a crypto analyst known pseudonymously as Slick on social media platform X. The 800 EMA, which has served as a significant resistance level for PEPE price uptrends, is now being tested again after a prolonged period below it. PEPE Eyes 800 EMA Breakout After Weeks Of Rejection PEPE is showing signs of a potential bullish reversal, with the price moving toward a critical technical level that could redefine its short-term trajectory. This critical technical level is highlighted through technical analysis of the 800 EMA indicator. Related Reading: PEPE Price Hits $0.000027 ATH, On-Chain Data Says These Are The People Driving It Since January 19, PEPE has consistently traded below the 800 EMA, a trend that has kept the price subdued despite several attempts to break higher. However, recent price action suggests that this prolonged bearish structure may be coming to an end. The moving averages are converging more than the previous attempts. The current setup shows a stronger alignment between the short and long-term EMAs, which indicates weakening resistance and increases the probability of an upward breakout. However, this attempt to break above the 800 EMA is most convincing on the 15-minute candlestick timeframe and is yet to be evident on larger timeframes. Will This Snowball Into A Larger Timeframe Reversal? The question is whether PEPE’s breakout attempt above the 800 EMA on the 15-minute chart will spark a broader shift in momentum across higher timeframes. Short-term breakouts like this serve as the primer for larger trend reversals, particularly when aligned with technical indicators such as the Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). Related Reading: PEPE Marks Bottom After Scary Market Crash, Enters Wave 3 With Over 500% Promise A successful breakout here could bring higher timeframe levels into play, which would mean a longer-term bullish momentum. However, there’s still a risk of a PEPE price rejection at the 800 EMA, even on the 15-minute candlestick timeframe. As shown in the price chart above, this rejection has already happened twice this month, once at the start of January and again on January 11. However, the current test is more peculiar because other EMAs, including the 200 EMA, have now converged more closely than during the previous failed breakouts. This alignment suggests that resistance may be weakening and increases the likelihood of a decisive move higher. At the time of writing, PEPE is trading at $0.000009829, up by 3.13% in the past 24 hours. The increase in the past 24 hours is a positive signal for PEPE’s breakout from the 15-minute 800 EMA to larger timeframes. However, there is still work to do, as PEPE is currently down by 3.85% in a seven-day timeframe. There is also a notable resistance at $0.00001019 that could delay any further uptrend move.

Established players like UNUS SED LEO (LEO) and Hedera (HBAR) are encountering hurdles, while innovative projects like Web3Bay (3BAY) are capturing significant attention. LEO, fueled by its exchange-backed structure, has the potential to reach $12.69 if market interest remains strong. Conversely, HBAR is navigating challenges below the $0.25 mark, with technical indicators hinting at continued bearish pressure. But the real story is Web3Bay. Unlike assets driven by mere speculation, Web3Bay is tackling a real-world issue: the centralization of e-commerce. By eliminating hefty fees, enhancing transaction security, and returning control to users through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), Web3Bay is primed for substantial growth. Having already amassed $1.120 million in its presale, and with a launch price projected at $0.1959, early backers could see returns as high as 4,200%. In a market craving tangible value, Web3Bay is a compelling option for those seeking the best crypto coin to invest in. With 295 million tokens already sold, the FOMO is real. LEO’s Ascent: Charting a Course to $12 and Beyond UNUS SED LEO (LEO), the utility token of Bitfinex, is currently trading at $8.67. This token, an integral part of the exchange’s financial framework, employs a structured buyback strategy. Each month, Bitfinex allocates 27% of its profits to repurchase and burn LEO, effectively reducing the circulating supply and creating scarcity. Analysts project a potential 46% surge in LEO’s value by March 2025, with the token anticipated to fluctuate between $8.62 and $12.69 in February. A consistent upward trend has already propelled LEO’s value by 4.06% in the past month, bolstering investor confidence. The Fear & Greed Index, currently at 44, indicates market uncertainty, reflecting a balance between buyers and sellers. While LEO exhibits bullish signals, the resistance level at $12.69 is a crucial point to observe. Should demand persist, LEO could surpass this level, presenting an opportunity for those interested in an exchange-backed token with a built-in deflationary mechanism. Hedera’s Predicament: Can HBAR Overcome Market Headwinds? Hedera (HBAR) continues to face headwinds, remaining below the $0.25 resistance level. Despite a substantial market capitalization of $8.7 billion, HBAR has struggled to gain significant upward momentum, and technical indicators point toward potential further downside unless buying pressure increases. The Average Directional Index (ADX) remains elevated at 41.1, signifying a strong and prolonged downtrend. Conversely, the Directional Movement Indicator (DMI) offers a glimmer of hope, with the +DI rising from 3.9 to 12.8, while the -DI has decreased from 44.7 to 28. This suggests a potential easing of selling pressure, which could lead to price stabilization in the near future. The Ichimoku Cloud chart reinforces the bearish outlook, as HBAR remains below key resistance levels, indicating continued challenges. Web3Bay: Empowering Buyers and Sellers in a Decentralized World Web3Bay is poised to revolutionize the multi-trillion dollar e-commerce sector by cutting out intermediaries, lowering transaction costs, and empowering users with complete control over their buying and selling experiences. Unlike centralized giants like Amazon and eBay, which impose restrictive policies and high fees, Web3Bay operates on a fully decentralized model, enabling secure peer-to-peer transactions via blockchain technology. Governance is entirely decentralized, with 3BAY token holders having a direct voice through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), guaranteeing that no single entity can manipulate the platform. The Web3Bay presale has generated substantial interest, raising $1.120 million, with 295 million tokens sold across various stages. Currently priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, 3BAY is projected to launch at $0.1959, an estimated 4,200% ROI for early adopters. This is why many are eyeing 3BAY as the best crypto coin to invest in. Analysts forecast that Web3Bay could reach $0.50 by mid-2025 if adoption continues at its current rate. As blockchain technology reshapes traditional industries, Web3Bay’s secure, cost-effective, and community-driven marketplace positions it as a high-growth investment. A Quick Recap LEO and HBAR are grappling with market resistance. While LEO’s token burn mechanism provides long-term deflationary benefits, and HBAR’s enterprise adoption could fuel future demand, neither possesses the disruptive potential of Web3Bay. As crypto investors shift their focus away from meme coins and hype-driven assets, Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce model emerges as a true innovator. As Web3 adoption accelerates and more buyers and sellers seek blockchain-powered alternatives to centralized platforms, Web3Bay is positioned to become one of the standout success stories of 2025. For those searching for the best crypto coin to invest in, Web3Bay’s potential is undeniable.

Analyst states the network’s utility has helped reduce selling pressure, allowing SOL to maintain its position near $200. Contrary to the Solana market analysis that states that Solana held above $200, FET price fall was steep, dropping 26% in the past week as artificial intelligence tokens experienced broader market weakness. In a tragic scenario where token holders are struck with a dilemma of either holding or selling, BlockDAG ‘s affiliate program which offers 5% instant USDT cashback seems to be gearing to be the top crypto for 2025. Solana Market Analysis States the Token is Relentless, Is it The Top Crypto? The 1-hour SOL/USDT chart used for Solana market analysis shows that Solana was trading below its 20-period moving average, signalling bearish momentum. With constraint ng Bollinger Bands there seems to be less lower volatility. Delving deep into the gain and loss of Solana market analysis , The Relative Strength Index indicator (RSI) is sitting at 42.19, showing slight bearish pressure, as it is heading downwards However, its subtle upward movement hints at a potential recovery. Overall the SOL market analysis warns crypto investors to keep an eye on $200 as resistance and $185 as support. A breakout above or below either of these levels could decide Solana’s next move. FET Price Fall–26%, Was it that Steep? FET has seen a sharp decline, with the FET price fall amounting to 26% over the past week, market weakness spread across all AI tokens. Currently, FET is trading at $0.776, showing a 2.145 % loss in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $2.05 billion, the token has a 24-hour trading volume of $719.2 million and a circulating supply of 2.6 billion tokens. Technical indicators suggest the FET price fall could continue, as the price is currently below the Golden Cross level of $1.002. The 50-day moving average at $1.2388 acts as a key resistance, while the immediate support stands at $0.7635. With more selling, the FET price fall may lead to a test of the psychological support level at $0.5000. BlockDAG’s 5% Cashback– The Presale Driving Force BlockDAG’s presale is unstoppable as it raised over $194 million, with over 18.3 billion coins sold since the launch. Early holders who took the leap of faith in buying BlockDAG are enjoying an incredible 2,380% ROI. This could position BDAG as one of the top crypto for 2025. The main driving force behind BlockDAG is fueled by its 5% Affiliate Program, which offers instant USDT cashback rewards for both referrers and new buyers. As a case in point, if a current BDAG holder refers to a friend who purchases $5,000 worth of BDAG, then both individuals become eligible to earn $250 in USDT instantly. There are no hidden conditions and terms, making the process straightforward, rewarding, and designed for growth. This basic, yet effective model has drawn participants eager to benefit from a shared-win scenario. Not only does it boost BDAG sales, but it also attracts new buyers into BlockDAG’s ecosystem, which in return motivates BDAG to give back more to the community. As the 27th batch of the presale sells out quickly, many believe the $600 million presale target is more of a reality than just a predicted value. At $0.0248 per coin, BDAG remains an appealing entry point. It’s game on! With time running out, and tokens selling like hot cakes, those joining the presale now are aiming to secure their positions before BDAG reaches its next higher price value. What Crypto Buyers are Looking For Despite the market liquidations happening, Solana market analysis made a solid statement saying that the network’s utility was the main factor that saved Solana from a great downfall. Contrasting to Solana resilience, the FET price fall was quite deep, and the artificial intelligence token fell below the 50-day moving average. This shows that projects with good propaganda will always be on the winning side. A good propaganda should always reward the community for their support and crypto buyers expect this. BlockDAG just does exactly that with its affiliate program which offers 5% instant USDT cashback on purchases.

The speculation came after the broadcast announced more third-party titles, including Capcom’s Monster Hunter Wilds, Gearbox’s Borderlands 4, Q-Games’ Dreams of Another, and more. The Xbox first-party game features on PS5 come after many predictions among gaming industry analysts that Microsoft might be forced to diversify its game offerings on multiple platforms. A recent interview with Kantan Games chief executive Dr. Serkan Toto revealed his belief that Microsoft would launch its games on other platforms this year. Toto further highlighted that factors like the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for nearly $69 billion and increasing costs will force the company to introduce its games to PlayStation 5 sooner than expected. The Kantan Games CEO speculated that gamers could expect Perfect Dark and Gears of War: E-Day in the 2025 line-up. Sony is the third company to release a teaser of what gamers can expect from the company this year. Nintendo launched the trailer of the Nintendo Switch 2, showcasing the features of the Switch 1 successor. Nintendo also teased one of the games to launch with the console, which many gamers speculated was a variation of Mario Kart. Xbox released its line-up for 2025, mentioning titles like Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, South of Midnight, Avowed, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and more. PlayStation first-party games fail to feature in State of Play The State of Play failed to feature two of the most awaited first-party games, Ghost of Yotei and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. The no-show on the broadcast came as a disappointment for many gamers, who took to social media platforms to mention its lack of appearance in the State of Play. Other titles gamers expected on the broadcast but Sony failed to showcase include God of War: Greek Saga Remaster, Parasite Eve: Remake, and Resident Evil IX. Death Stranding 2 still recently appeared on the South Korean Game Rating and Administration Committee, the VGC, which highlighted its unsuitability for children. VGC mentioned that the post-apocalyptic game had extreme violence, gore and mutilation, excessive profanity, drug expressions, and more. The game rating committee decided to classify it under the ‘not available for use by youth’ category. The game’s appearance on the rating website led to speculation that while its launch may not be imminent, the game’s development was proceeding strongly. The Death Stranding 2 director, Hideo Kojima, tweeted on February 5 an image with the words ‘A Hideo Kojima Game,’ leading to more speculations that Sony would reveal its trailer soon. Another tweet from the director before the image highlighted that he was seated at the editing machine but had not begun the editing process. Some gamers wished Kojima luck through the editing process, while others mentioned their anticipation for the trailer. Gamers still did not get what they were anticipating after the trailer failed to show up in the State of Play broadcast. Sony improves its cross-platform multiplayer gaming Sony Interactive has been focusing on improving its cross-platform multiplayer gaming ecosystem which provides a Share Link that would allow PlayStation gamers to invite other gamers from different platforms to enjoy multiplayer gaming. The company revealed its plans in a patent published on January 2 after being in filing since May last year. The patent also details how PS users can create sessions and generate responses from the session recipients. The entertainment company has also been focusing significantly on boosting user experience. Sony released another patent that suggested the use of AI to predict player movements and reduce lagging during gameplay. The patent explained that a camera would monitor the player and controller for analysis, predicting the player’s intention. The technology could also guess the player’s intentions through the initiation of the ‘incomplete controller action’ feature. A third patent floated another feature, the DualSense, which could turn the controller into a gun for RPG and first-person shooting games. DualSense would help make gamers’ experiences more realistic. The patent explained that players could hold the controller sideways after activating DualSense and holding the right arm as the gun’s handle.

Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a newbie in the crypto space, you know that the market can be volatile, but it’s also packed with opportunities. Among the names to watch are Qubetics , Algorand, and Sonic—each bringing something unique to the table. So, what’s the buzz surrounding these coins, and why should they be on your radar? Now, let’s get real. Qubetics ($TICS), Algorand (ALGO), and Sonic (SONIC) are all set to make waves in the crypto world for different reasons. Qubetics is gaining traction with its innovative approach to cross-border transactions, while Algorand continues to push the envelope with its scalable blockchain technology. And then there’s Sonic, with its focus on decentralized finance (DeFi), grabbing attention for its potential in revolutionizing financial ecosystems. But the big question is: which one will bring the most value to your portfolio? With the cryptocurrency landscape becoming more complex and diversified, we’re going to break down each of these promising projects to help you make an informed decision. As we dive deeper into Qubetics, Algorand, and Sonic, we’ll uncover their unique features, use cases, and what sets them apart in the world of blockchain. Moreover, we’ll discuss how Qubetics addresses real-life problems that its predecessors, like Kaspa and others, have failed to solve, making it a perfect fit for the future of digital finance. Qubetics: The Future of Cross-Border Transactions In the world of cryptocurrency, one of the most exciting prospects is Qubetics ($TICS), a project that’s revolutionizing the way we think about cross-border transactions. Today’s traditional banking systems are often slow, expensive, and lack transparency when it comes to international money transfers. But Qubetics is stepping in to solve these issues with blockchain technology, making global transactions smoother, faster, and more affordable for businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. Right now, Qubetics is in its 21st presale stage, having already sold over 470 million tokens to more than 19,700 holders, raising over $12.6 million. This impressive presale momentum is creating a lot of buzz, and with a current price of just $0.0733 per token, many are eager to jump on board before the project hits the next phase of its journey. Qubetics aims to transform the way we handle money across borders by offering a fast, low-cost, and efficient payment method. This could be a game-changer for businesses that rely on international trade, freelancers who work with clients worldwide, or anyone who needs to send money abroad. What makes Qubetics stand out from other coins in the market is its focus on solving real-world problems. Traditional financial institutions charge high fees for cross-border payments, and these transactions can take several days to process. Qubetics, on the other hand, uses its blockchain to eliminate intermediaries, reducing transaction costs and speeding up the process. With a $TICS token that’s expected to see substantial ROI—from 240.64% when the presale ends to 20,338% after the mainnet launch—it’s clear that this project is poised for massive growth. Qubetics isn’t just about quick transactions; it’s about building a sustainable and scalable network that will serve the global economy in the long run. As the presale continues, Qubetics is gathering a strong community that believes in the potential of its technology. The excitement surrounding the project is palpable, and it’s no wonder why it’s one of the top cryptos for massive growth right now. Algorand: Scaling Blockchain for the Future While Qubetics is focusing on revolutionizing cross-border transactions, Algorand is taking a different route by aiming to solve the scalability and speed issues that have long plagued blockchain technology. Founded by Silvio Micali, a Turing Award-winning cryptographer, Algorand offers a highly scalable blockchain that doesn’t sacrifice decentralization or security. In short, Algorand seeks to address the core limitations of older blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which struggle to handle large volumes of transactions. One of the standout features of Algorand is its Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus algorithm, which allows the network to process thousands of transactions per second. This level of scalability could make Algorand the blockchain of choice for developers looking to build decentralized applications (dApps) and platforms that need high throughput. As blockchain technology continues to grow, Algorand could be the backbone for everything from DeFi platforms to supply chain management systems. The ALGO token, which powers the Algorand network, has seen steady growth and adoption. One key aspect that investors love is the Algorand Foundation’s focus on sustainable blockchain practices, making it a long-term player in the digital asset space. So, if you’re looking for a crypto project that’s serious about scaling blockchain technology without compromising on performance, Algorand might just be the one to watch. What sets Algorand apart from other cryptos is its focus on real-world use cases, particularly in finance, supply chain, and digital identity. With Algorand powering fast and secure transactions, businesses can leverage blockchain for more efficient operations without dealing with the limitations of traditional financial systems. Sonic: Decentralizing Finance Like Never Before Next up is Sonic (SONIC), a project that’s gaining traction for its focus on decentralizing finance (DeFi) in a way that appeals to both traditional investors and those already deep into the crypto space. Sonic aims to create a more inclusive financial system where users can participate in lending, borrowing, and trading without needing intermediaries like banks or traditional financial institutions. By eliminating the middleman, Sonic promises to offer lower fees, more control for users, and faster transactions. With its focus on DeFi, Sonic is tapping into a rapidly growing segment of the cryptocurrency market. DeFi platforms have gained massive popularity because they offer the same financial services as traditional institutions but without the restrictions or fees. Sonic differentiates itself by combining the power of decentralization with user-friendly features, making it accessible to a wider audience. What makes Sonic particularly exciting is its community-driven approach. Instead of focusing on a single corporate entity controlling the platform, Sonic allows its users to have a say in how the network operates. This decentralized governance model ensures that the project stays true to its values of openness and transparency. As Sonic continues to build its ecosystem, it’s likely to attract more users looking for innovative ways to participate in decentralized finance. Whether you’re looking to earn passive income through staking or borrow crypto without dealing with banks, Sonic has something to offer. Understanding Cross-Border Transactions in Cryptocurrency When it comes to cryptocurrencies, one of the most exciting aspects is the ability to send and receive payments across borders without the need for traditional banks. This is especially true for Qubetics, which is focused on making cross-border transaction easier, faster, and cheaper for businesses, professionals, and individuals. But what exactly are cross-border transactions, and why do they matter? Cross-border transactions involve the transfer of funds between parties in different countries. Traditional banking systems often make these transactions cumbersome and expensive due to high fees, currency exchange costs, and long processing times. Cryptocurrencies like Qubetics eliminate these barriers by allowing for near-instantaneous transactions that are not dependent on central authorities or traditional banking systems. For businesses, cross-border payments can be a huge headache. Whether you’re paying international suppliers or receiving payments from overseas customers, the costs and delays associated with traditional payment methods can add up quickly. Qubetics solves this problem by providing a blockchain-based platform that makes these transactions not only cheaper but also more secure and transparent. This is just one of the ways Qubetics is positioning itself as a top crypto for massive growth. Conclusion: As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, it’s clear that Qubetics is one to watch. With its unique approach to cross-border transactions and its focus on solving real-world problems, Qubetics is well-positioned to meet the demands of the future. Whether you’re looking to invest in a project with massive growth potential or you’re just exploring the possibilities of blockchain technology, Qubetics offers a solid investment opportunity. The Qubetics presale is currently in its 21st stage, and with over 470 million tokens sold and a growing community of holders, now is the perfect time to get in before the next phase of the project. With the potential for massive returns once the mainnet launches, there’s no doubt that Qubetics is one of the top cryptos for massive growth in 2025 and beyond.

Politicians in the land of the rising sun have also been praising the initiative, in spite of a glaring lack of focus on violent and wasteful war funding. Elon Musk’s recent White House speech about the problems of bloated bureaucracies has struck a chord with popular influencers on Japanese social media. “This is Japan!” Japanese nationalist X user Nihon Patriot declared in response to Musk’s statement that unelected bureaucrats should not hold power. Musk, who said on February 11 that “if there’s going to be fraud it should at least go to Americans” criticized unelected “leaders” (such as himself, ironically) while correctly diagnosing the bloat of the American bureaucracy. Blind praise for D.O.G.E from influencers, Japan’s political rulers It is not only social media influencers like Nihon Patriot, and “seigihakatta” (who notes that Musk is talking right to Japan as well) praising Trump and Musk, but powerful political figures like Japan’s prime minister Shigeru Ishiba and Minister of Digital Transformation (DX), Masaaki Taira. Just last week Ishiba met with Trump to discuss strengthening military alliances. The self-described “defense geek” PM has unrelentingly been squeezing the Japanese people for more military spending and investment in the US, even as the well runs dry of yen at home, and pensions for retirees and the elderly suffer. For his part, DX minister Taira has been a vocal proponent of D.O.G.E from the start, saying in November that “We would like to follow up closely and incorporate it into Japan’s administrative reform.” In the midst of Ishiba’s unprecedented one-trillion-dollar investment goal in the US, and US artificial intelligence development, the Japanese PM has also ordered Taira to get to work on an active cyber-defense system for Japan, and plans have been drawn up to increasingly govern the populace with AI. This spending has not been without controversy in the island nation, with many Japanese left wondering why so much attention and money are being pumped into overseas initiatives — especially by those vocal about government “efficiency.” War and violence — where D.O.G.E goes rabid A cursory glance at what Musk’s cartoonishly-named department has done so far (via the official website ), shows that the U.S. empire’s massive military spending has not been addressed at all. If anything, some nice bones have been thrown to people understandably tired of wasteful spending on so-called “woke” agendas like the gender debate and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion)-related matters, and Department of Education spending has also been reduced. That is, according to the site. To advocates of freedom and fiscal conservatives, this in and of itself probably seems well and good. But in the place of such cuts, there is no resultant monetary benefit or freedom made available, social tensions between people of various backgrounds are needlessly exacerbated via statist agendas, and the war machine keeps rumbling over the bodies and bones of the oppressed as it always does. As multi-billion-dollar proof of this, Trump is now planning to send $8 billion in weapons to the government of Israel, bypassing a review process and continuing a controversial Biden-era initiative. This happens as surviving Gazans are railroaded out of their homes so the bombed-out land can be turned into a “Riviera of the Middle East” controlled by the United States.

The video game retailer, known for its wild meme stock history, is considering adding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to its balance sheet, according to a report from CNBC. The news sent GameStop’s stock surging as much as 20% in extended trading. The company is still deciding. There’s no official commitment yet. “GameStop is exploring it, but nothing is final,” a source close to the company said . Executives are reviewing whether Bitcoin fits into the company’s financial strategy before making a move. GameStop’s Bitcoin talks and Ryan Cohen’s involvement GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen fueled speculation over the weekend when he posted a picture on X with Michael Saylor, the co-founder and chairman of MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. But despite the online frenzy, two sources confirmed that Saylor is not involved in GameStop’s crypto investment discussions. This wouldn’t be GameStop’s first crypto venture. In 2022, the company launched a crypto wallet to support Bitcoin, Ethereum, and NFTs. But by 2023, it shut the service down, blaming “regulatory uncertainty.” Cohen, the billionaire behind Chewy, has been running GameStop since 2021. He originally joined as an investor in 2020, right before the stock became the face of retail trader mania. His leadership has focused on cost-cutting and operational efficiency rather than aggressive expansion. As of November 2, GameStop had a $4.6 billion cash reserve, according to a December securities filing. That money has been earmarked for investments, and Bitcoin is now on the table. In December 2023, GameStop’s board approved an updated “investment policy.” It gave Cohen, two independent board members, and select staff the power to manage the company’s securities portfolio. Any investments outside the policy require approval from either the committee (by unanimous vote) or the full board (by majority vote). Bitcoin as a corporate asset: Who else is doing it? If GameStop follows through, it will join a growing list of companies adding Bitcoin to their corporate treasuries. The biggest name on that list is MicroStrategy, which rebranded as Strategy after shifting its focus to Bitcoin. Led by Saylor, the company has accumulated 471,000 BTC—roughly 2% of all Bitcoin in circulation. In 2025 alone, it has made four Bitcoin purchases, including two billion-dollar acquisitions. MicroStrategy’s strategy has paid off. Over the past year, its stock has soared more than 400%. With an $83 billion market cap, it’s now bigger than Capital One and Target. Other companies are following suit. According to crypto security firm Coinkite, at least 78 corporations worldwide now hold Bitcoin in their treasuries. OneMedNet, a healthcare data company with a $30 million market cap, raised $4.6 million through a private stock sale and immediately used the funds to buy Bitcoin. The reason? To fight off short-sellers. Another example is KULR, a company specializing in thermal energy management for NASA and the U.S. Navy. It recently bought 510 BTC. “A Michael Saylor inspiration,” KULR CEO Michael Mo said. Since announcing in December that it would put 90% of its surplus cash into Bitcoin, KULR’s stock has jumped 117%. GameStop already has experience handling digital assets. If it moves forward, it would be one of the biggest names yet to take Bitcoin onto its balance sheet. The decision could signal a shift in corporate treasury management, pushing more public companies to embrace Bitcoin as a financial asset.

Rooted in the original BitVM protocol, Bitlayer's Finality Bridge introduces the first version of the protocol live on testnet, which is a good starting point for realizing the promises of the Bitcoin Renaissance or “Season 2”. Follow GG on X Unlike earlier BTC bridges that often required reliance on centralized entities or questionable trust assumptions, the Finality Bridge leverages a blend of BitVM smart contracts, fraud proofs, and zero-knowledge proofs. This combination not only enhances security but also significantly reduces the need for trust in third parties. We’re not at the trustless level that Lightning provides, but this is a million times better than current sidechains designs claiming to be Bitcoin Layers 2s (in addition to significantly increasing the design space for Bitcoin applications). The system operates on a principle where funds are securely locked in addresses governed by a BitVM smart contract, functioning under the premise that at least one participant in the system will act honestly. This setup inherently reduces the trust requirements but has to introduce additional complexities that Bitlayer aims to manage with this version of the bridge. Source: https://blog.bitlayer.org/introducing_finality_bridge/ The Mechanics of Trust In practical terms, when Bitcoin is locked into the BitVM smart contract through the Finality Bridge, users are issued YBTC - a token that maintains a strict 1:1 peg with Bitcoin. This peg is not just a promise but is enforced by the underlying smart contract logic, ensuring that each YBTC represents a real, locked Bitcoin on the main chain (no fake “restacked” BTC metrics). This mechanism allows users to participate in DeFi activities like lending, borrowing, and yield farming within the Bitlayer ecosystem without compromising on the security and settlement assurances that Bitcoin provides. While some in the community might find these activities objectionable, this type of architecture allows users to get some guarantees that they previously could not hope to get with traditional sidechain designs, with the added bonus that we do not need to “change” Bitcoin to make it happen (although covenants would make this bridge design completely “trust-minimized, which would effectively make it a “ True ” Bitcoin Layer 2). For more details about the different levels of risks associated with sidechains designs, take a look at Bitcoin Layers assessment of Bitlayer here . However, until such advancements come to fruition, the Bitlayer Finality Bridge serves as the best realization of the BitVM 2 paradigm. It's a testament to what's possible after the dev “brain drain” from centralized chains back to Bitcoin. Despite all the challenges that BitVM chains will face, I remain exceptionally excited at the prospect of Bitcoin fulfilling its destiny as the Ultimate Settlement Chain for all economic activity.

With its innovative blockchain and AI integration, Lightchain AI is rapidly gaining attention from investors. The Lightchain AI Presale has already raised over $15.3 million at a presale price of $0.006, signaling strong confidence in its potential. As both XRP and Lightchain AI aim for significant growth, they’re becoming key players in the evolving crypto market. XRP Aims for New ATH- What’s Behind Surge As of February 7, 2025, XRP is trading at approximately $2.32, reflecting a slight decline from its recent peak. The cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of $3.40 on January 16, 2025. Analysts suggest that breaking through the $3.40 resistance could propel XRP to the $4.20–$4.50 range. Some projections are even more optimistic, with targets up to $8, contingent on favorable market conditions and regulatory developments. The recent surge is attributed to investor optimism regarding potential regulatory clarity and increased adoption of Ripple’s payment solutions. However, market volatility remains a concern, and XRP’s future performance will depend on broader cryptocurrency market trends and ongoing legal developments. Lightchain AI- Aiming for 28x Rally Lightchain AI is garnering significant attention in the cryptocurrency market due to its innovative integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Analysts project that its token, LCAI, could experience a substantial increase, potentially reaching $3 by the end of 2025—a remarkable rise from its presale price of $0.006 This optimistic outlook is driven by Lightchain AI’s unique Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, thereby enhancing network security and efficiency. Additionally, the platform’s Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enables seamless execution of AI-specific tasks on the blockchain, positioning it as a leader in decentralized AI applications. The project’s successful presale, raising over $15.3 million, reflects strong investor confidence in its potential. As the demand for AI-driven blockchain solutions grows, Lightchain AI’s strategic approach and technological advancements make it a promising candidate for significant returns. Invest Now- Lightchain AI is Set to Outshine Competition With its disruptive integration of AI and blockchain technology, Lightchain AI is poised for significant growth in the cryptocurrency market. As XRP aims for a new ATH and Lightchain AI sets its sights on a 28x rally, both projects represent opportunities for investors to capitalize on the evolving landscape. As always, it’s essential to do your own research and consult with financial advisors before making any investment decisions. However, keeping an eye on these two key players in the crypto space could prove beneficial as they continue to push boundaries and make waves in the industry. Don’t miss the opportunity to be an early investor in Lightchain AI , a groundbreaking project revolutionizing the AI landscape.

While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation. Why THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value.

Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL has proven its appeal. Investors recognize its potential to redefine the market, driving interest far beyond what UNI, BTC, or LTC have recently seen. How THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Compares Uniswap (UNI): A strong DeFi platform but lacks the exclusivity and demand-driving scarcity of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL . Polkadot (DOT): Reliable for interoperability but cannot match the early-stage explosive growth seen here.

Currently, Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are experiencing interesting price movements, while Web3Bay is making significant strides with its web3 crypto project, having already raised over $1.120 million in its ongoing presale, selling over 295 million tokens. These digital assets have captured the attention of both seasoned and novice investors. Let’s examine these three projects and their potential. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action: Anticipating a Potential Upswing Ethereum (ETH), currently trading around $2,610 after a recent dip, has captured the attention of analysts who are observing a four-year ascending triangle formation. This pattern suggests a possible breakout to a target price of $7,500. While the SEC’s decision on Ethereum ETFs remains pending, influencing market sentiment, the network is witnessing increased support for a gas limit increase. This adjustment could enhance network efficiency and reduce transaction fees, further solidifying Ethereum’s position in the cryptocurrency space. Despite short-term price fluctuations, Ethereum’s fundamental strength lies in its widespread adoption and continuous development within its ecosystem, particularly in DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts. These factors contribute to the confidence of long-term holders. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Whale Activity and Market Dynamics Shiba Inu (SHIB) presents a complex picture. Large holder netflows have increased by 5,277%, indicating significant accumulation by major wallets. A substantial whale transaction involving 3.36 trillion SHIB tokens, valued at $51.15 million, has further fueled market discussions. However, this accumulation is juxtaposed with a decline in trading volume, which has fallen below $400 million, and a 61% reduction in the burn rate. This slowdown in the burn rate suggests a possible cooling-off period for SHIB. Although Shiba Inu benefits from a strong community, its reliance on community support and the development of long-term utility remains crucial. The concentration of SHIB tokens in the top 10 wallets, which hold 61.3% of the total supply, also introduces a potential for price volatility. The increase in large holder net flows is a positive sign for Shiba Inu and shows that there is still interest in the project, but the decrease in trading volume and the burn rate is something that should be monitored. Web3Bay’s Million-Dollar Presale Has Everyone Talking! Web3Bay is introducing a new paradigm for online buying and selling through its 3BAY token. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that charge fees on every transaction, Web3Bay eliminates intermediaries, leading to lower costs and greater benefits for both buyers and sellers. Sellers retain a larger portion of their earnings, and buyers enjoy more competitive prices. This is all facilitated by blockchain technology and smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security. The 3BAY token serves as more than just a payment method; it’s a rewards system. Users can earn discounts, cashback, and even governance rights, empowering them to participate in the platform’s future development. The Web3Bay presale has been highly successful, raising over $1.120 million and selling over 295 million tokens, demonstrating strong investor interest. Currently priced at $0.004562625, the 3BAY token is expected to reach $0.1959 at its launch, offering early investors a substantial potential return. Web3Bay’s approach to e-commerce, combined with the 3BAY token’s utility, positions it for continued expansion within the web3 space. The project’s focus on real-world application distinguishes it from many other projects. The Web3Bay team is working to provide a seamless user experience. The platform also plans to integrate traditional payment methods like PayPal, making it accessible to a wider audience. The project’s vision is to make cryptocurrency accessible to everyone. The Web3Bay presale offers an opportunity to get involved in the future of decentralized e-commerce. Concluding Thoughts Ethereum’s price action suggests a potential upswing, while Shiba Inu experiences a mix of positive and concerning signals. Web3Bay, with its innovative approach to e-commerce and successful presale, presents a unique opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the web3 space. Each of these projects offers distinct possibilities within the cryptocurrency market, and investors should carefully consider their individual risk tolerance and investment goals when evaluating these options. The Web3Bay presale, with its current price point and future potential, offers an interesting entry point for those interested in the future of decentralized e-commerce. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, projects like Web3Bay, Ethereum, and Shiba Inu will continue to be closely watched by traders and investors.

The crypto market is now witnessing a shift to projects with real-world applications and long-term potential, especially RWA and AI-altcoins, as they are the hottest narrative at the moment. Therefore, a Solana trader dumped PNUT for PropiChain. In this text, we will discuss the reason why the Solana trader dumped PNUT for PropiChain (PCHAIN) and also analyze what makes PCHAIN unique. Why Solana Trader Dumped PNUT for PropiChain Market shift is just one out of the many reasons why the Solana trader dumped PNUT for PropiChain. Hereunder, we will look into some reasons behind the trader’s decision. PNUT Thrives on Community: PNUT, like other Solana meme projects thrive solely on community hype without any intrinsic value attributed to it. This lack of intrinsic value will make it highly susceptible to rapid decline which in the case of PNUT dropped from over $2 billion market cap to 171 million. PropiChain’s Presale Success: The project has raised more than $2.5 million in presale, and the early investors that joined the first round are already in profit by more than 150%. Joining now when it is still going for a discounted price of $0.011 means you will be in profit by the third stage and it will keep ascending. Technological Innovation and Real-world Impact: PropiChain aims to capitalize on techs like the Metaverse, artificial intelligence and blockchain to reshape and make the global real estate market efficient. These offerings make the project attractive to the Solana PNUT trader. Hereunder, we will further look into how this technological innovation will benefit investors. PropiChain Aims to Reshape the Global Real Estate Market PropiChain aims to tokenize the real estate industry, and introduce a fractional ownership model. Therefore, entering the real estate industry will become easier because this model will abolish financial restrictions that reserve the sector for wealthy investors. For instance, instead of the 10% mortgage upfront payment or any other loan to get a property of high-value, you can obtain a fraction of it. This means you can invest $100 in an asset worth $25,000 and still earn a profit from it. Also, the DeFi feature of PropiChain decentralized platform lets you stake the portion purchased as collateral which can earn interest for you. If you wish to sell off your asset, investors can buy it in fractions. This will lead to enhanced liquidity in the real estate market. PropiChain’s artificial Intelligence will also assist investors in filtering property listings to get property that resonates with their preferences and goals. Users can utilize the advanced filter to highlight assets with growing trends or neighborhood amenities if that is what they are in the market for. The PropiChain AI can also recommend assets similar to your search history in the future, saving you the stress of re-initiating the advanced search criteria. When you’re ready to pay, the AI technology on this decentralized marketplace ensures the pricing is right. Using the Automated Valuation Models (AVMs), the Artificial Intelligence consults multiple information to arrive at accurate cost. This includes current market trends, historical price performances, and economic indicators. With the AVMs at your disposal, you can never overpay for a property or get underpaid for the property you wish to sell. Get your investment decisions right with predictive market analysis compiled by PCHAIN’s AI. This technology will evaluate different data from different sources to forecast property that may increase or decrease in value. Leveraging these analyses helps you make strategic decisions that will mitigate risky investments. For buyers and sellers who want to explore the real estate market in locations far from them, the feature Metaverse will enable and ke it easy. For instance, if you stay in New York and wish to own properties in Singapore, you can use the interactive environment of the Metaverse to inspect houses listed by sellers in Singapore. Also, once you find a property that fits your need, meetings can be help with sellers on the realistic environment of the Metavrse to close the deal. All these are executed on the PropiChain decentralized platform with maximum security and transparency. PropiChain’s public ledger stores all transactions In the market and this ledger is tamper-proof and available to every PropiChain user. This transparency level makes it difficult for fraudulent intermediaries to attempt to scam you. All you need to do is to verify the property details on the public ledger before authorizing payment. This security is confirmed with the BlockAudit rigorous review of the PropiChain’s smart contract. This crypto security firm tested the resilience and compliance to the industry standard. The result shows that the platform’s security system is flawless, giving investors peace of mind concerning their investment on PCHAIN. PropiChain Could Deliver Massive 80,500% Rally Unlike Solana memecoins, PropiChain is offering a solution in a sector that is one of the biggest globally. The real estate market is valued at over $300 billion globally. The focus and the revolutionary solutions PCHAIN will offer in this sector mean it could attract both institutional and retail investors, which will drive its value up. The broader cryptocurrency market is increasingly developing interest in AI and RWA narrative and PropiChain is a leader in the two spaces. Also, the project is witnessing a massive adoption and the CoinMarketCap listing further increases its visibility globally. Therefore, analysts believe PCHAIn is a high-potential project and delivering 80,500% ROI by 2025 Q2 is a no-brainer. Conclusion PropiChain’s alignment with the growing interest in AI and RWA further strengthens its appeal among investors. The analysts’ optimistic growth trajectory of an 80,500% ROI by Q2 of 2025 reflects PCHAIN’s high potential status. Therefore, joining at the current stage when it is going for a discounted price of $0.011 is once in a life-time opportunity. Also, an investment of $1000 in this current stage could yield more than $800k by Q2 of 2025. PropiChain could replicate the Solana early rally, and this is the best time to join.

Recently, a Dogecoin millionaire from the community spotted PCHAIN as the best altcoin to buy in 2025 . This dogecoin millionaire selection of PCHAIN is based on its token presale trajectory, which has already raised over $2.2 million, and its real-world utility use case that tackles traditional real estate investment process through its core AI integrations and blockchain technologies. In this article, we will look at why this dogecoin millionaire named PCHAIN as the best altcoin to buy in 2025 and how its AI features contribute to its upsurge among investors. Why are Dogecoin Millionaires Hunting for the Next Big Altcoin? Few crypto communities have had the massive adoption of Dogecoin garnered over the years. It all started as a meme coin launched based on social media buzz and celebrity endorsements like Elon Musk, and it grew by a large margin within a short period. However, despite its massive popularity, its lack of real-world utility use cases has been a major factor contributing to Dogecoin’s top holders diversifying their portfolios. With the crypto space rapidly shifting towards AI projects, crypto experts believe investing in altcoins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Cardano will only limit investors’ returns in the long run. While Dogecoin price swings are exciting, many investors are looking for the next breakthrough altcoin, like PropiChain which combines real-world use cases with cutting-edge technology. AI Features Contributing to PCHAIN Gaining Traction as the Best Altcoin to Buy Several crypto projects claim to be the best altcoin to buy in 2025; however, PropiChain stands out as a real estate AI altcoin due to its AI features that focus on automating and streamlining complex transaction processes. At the core of these features is its advanced AI integration, which automates various processes by allowing users to perform predictive market analysis and provide property suggestions through its automated valuation model and AI-power chatbots. This chatbot offers users 24/7 real-time support and guidance as they navigate the PropiChain platform, providing easy-to-understand explanations of real estate legal and financial agreements before they buy or sell their assets. Its property suggestions also analyze multiple data sources by providing recommendations based on users’ preferences and continuously learning to adapt to users’ interactions, considering a wide array of factors, including location preferences and desired property features. PropiChain metaverse implementations are also designed for international investors who don’t have the luxury of time to be physically present when trying to buy, sell or invest in an asset. Through its immersive 3D environment, investors can experiment with different layouts, designs and customized options of properties from anywhere in the world without any geographical barrier. Its virtual stagings also serve as a powerful marketing tool, making listings more attractive and engaging to prospective buyers. Likewise, its virtual meetings allow users to stay responsive through each decisive process, ensuring active participation during real estate exploration. Compared to other real estate AI altcoins, PropiChain is implementing advanced features to digitalize properties and assets, ensuring all transactions are made on a secure blockchain network without needing to document each process physically. It also implements fractional ownership of properties whereby assets can be sold, bought, and managed in smaller fractions by a broad range of investors instead of streamlined top whales in the market. This process further increases liquidity and access to financing on a secure and transparent platform, where all participants are verified, maintaining the integrity and transparency of the transaction process. Conclusion: Dogecoin Millionaires are Betting Big on The Best Altcoin to Buy, So Should You! After analyzing Dogecoin’s market trends, the rise of AI-driven crypto, and the unmatched potential of PCHAIN, Dogecoin millionaires strongly believe that PCHAIN is the best altcoin to buy in 2025. Its token presale is currently in its round two stage, selling at a low price of $0.01, the lowest valuation it will ever be before it skyrockets by 108.93% in round three. By investing just $3000 in PCHAIN, crypto analysts believe it could experience an explosive rally of over 100,000x yielding a minimum of $300,000, similar to Dogecoin’s legendary 2017 price surge when DOGE went from fractions of a cent to $0.70 in just months. PCHAIN has undergone a security review by BlockAudit and is listed on CoinMarketCap , confirming its credibility and strong roadmap. Buy PCHAIN tokens today before it hits the mainstream market!

While investors wait for the Dogecoin price to finally break out, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has surged 900%, grabbing the attention of traders struggling to find gains in this bear market. Rather than suffering like most assets, WallitIQ (WLTQ) continues to rise, proving that real innovation, strong tokenomics, and AI-driven utility can thrive even in the toughest conditions. With its presale price set to jump from $0.0420 to $0.0620, early adopters are rushing in before takeoff. However, this is just the beginning. While Dogecoin price and other meme coins stall, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is positioned to dominate the bear market, offering massive profit potential to early movers. Why Dogecoin Price Stagnates While WallitIQ (WLTQ) Surges In A Bear Market The Dogecoin price has struggled to gain serious momentum, remaining stuck well below $1 despite short-term fluctuations. The past month has been brutal, with Dogecoin price down nearly 23.9%, proving that meme hype alone isn’t enough to sustain growth. With no major developments or new adoption drivers, Dogecoin price remains vulnerable in this bear market, unable to generate the excitement it once had. Meanwhile, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has taken a completely different path, surging despite the bear market because of its AI-driven ecosystem, ultra-low transaction fees, and many other outstanding features. Unlike the Dogecoin price trajectory, which primarily relies on speculation, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is solving real problems in the crypto space. This AI-powered wallet simplifies crypto payments and portfolio management, offering tools like predictive analytics, sentiment analysis, and customized market alerts that give users an edge in trading and investing, even in a bear market. Another key factor in WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) 900% price explosion is its smart tokenomics. With only 45% of its supply allocated for public sale and 15% reserved for exchange liquidity, demand is rapidly outpacing available supply. While the Dogecoin price struggles under selling pressure especially given its outrageous market cap, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) limited token availability and high staking incentives are creating an environment where prices can only go up. The fact that investors can participate in yield farming and also earn up to 180% APY in staking rewards makes it even more attractive, giving traders a way to profit without relying solely on price action. With The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale Almost Gone, What Happens Next? The bear market has exposed weak projects and rewarded the strongest ones. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has proven it belongs in the latter category, with its presale selling out at record speed. As the price moves from $0.0420 to $0.0620, investors who locked in early are already seeing gains, while those who hesitate risk buying at much higher levels. Beyond its presale success, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) upcoming Beta Platform Launch is set to shake up the industry. Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), which still lacks a clear roadmap for innovation, this crypto project is mapped out for continuous development. Through the Beta Platform Launch , investors can try out the platform’s features like its MVP app that simplifies crypto transactions, merges multiple wallets, and aids portfolio management. With a thorough SolidProof audit and other security measures like AES & ECC encryption, P2D technology, AI-powered anomaly detection, and Escrow Connect , this platform protects both assets and data in the bear market. Exchange listings are on the horizon, meaning that WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) current price surge may only be the beginning. As more investors discover its potential, demand will continue to rise and only those who get into the presale now will see potential profits even in the consuming bear market. Dogecoin Price Struggles, WallitIQ (WLTQ) Keeps Climbing: Join The Presale Now For 900% Gains The bear market has revealed which projects are built for long-term success and which are struggling. Dogecoin price remains weak, with no significant growth despite repeated breakout attempts. WallitIQ (WLTQ) , however, has surged 900% in one of the harshest bear markets, proving it’s more than just hype. With its presale price of $0.0420 set to rise, exchange listings approaching, and a game-changing Beta Platform launching, this project is shaping up as one of 2024’s smartest investments. While the Dogecoin price stays stuck, early WallitIQ (WLTQ) investors are thriving in a bear market. To join them, purchase WLTQ tokens now.

With every cycle, new meme coins emerge, fueled by hype, community support, and fresh innovations in the crypto space. While many projects burn out as quickly as they launch, the true winners are those that offer real utility or capture the attention of millions. One project that’s dominating the conversation right now is BTFD Coin , a play-to-earn (P2E) powerhouse that’s reshaping how meme coins function. With a massive gaming ecosystem and real in-game earnings, BTFD is one of the top new meme coins to join for 2025 before its presale ends. Meanwhile, Popcat is proving that meme culture remains an unstoppable force, generating millions in trading volume with pure viral appeal. And Shiba Inu, no longer just a “Doge Killer,” is expanding into DeFi, the metaverse, and gaming, keeping it firmly in the top-tier of meme investments. BTFD Coin – P2E Gaming Meets a 3,650% Moon Price Potential BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s reinventing play-to-earn (P2E) gaming by allowing players to earn real crypto rewards for their in-game progress. This is a game-changer for meme coins, as it offers an actual use case beyond just trading. Gamers can now stack BTFD tokens while competing, then stake them for 90% APY, further increasing their earnings. Imagine a future where every victory in the BTFD ecosystem translates into real value. Whether it’s battling other players, completing missions, or unlocking achievements, every move has the potential to earn tokens that can be held, traded, or staked for more passive income. With gaming being a $200 billion industry, BTFD Coin is positioned to tap into a massive audience that extends far beyond traditional meme coin investors. Now let’s talk numbers. BTFD Coin is currently priced at just $0.00016, and analysts predict that once the token goes live, it could surge to $0.006, meaning early investors could secure a 3,650% ROI. If someone buys 40,000 BTFD today using the LAUNCH100 bonus code, their holdings instantly double to 80,000 BTFD. At the projected post-launch price of $0.006, that $6.40 investment today could turn into $480. BTFD Coin’s presale has already raised over $6 million, gained more than 10,600 holders, and sold over 69 billion tokens. But with only two stages left before launch, the window to lock in these presale prices is quickly closing. If you want in, this is the last chance before the FOMO kicks in and prices shoot up. Popcat – The Meme Coin That’s Breaking the Internet If Dogecoin taught us anything, it’s that meme power is real, and Popcat is proving it once again. What started as a viral meme of an open-mouthed cat has now evolved into a full-fledged crypto movement, attracting thousands of new investors daily. Unlike traditional projects that rely on complex roadmaps, Popcat thrives purely on viral appeal, making it one of the most unpredictable yet rewarding meme coins on the market. The community backing Popcat is growing at an explosive rate, fueled by TikTok trends, influencer hype, and a flood of trading volume. Many investors dismissed Dogecoin in its early days, thinking a joke coin could never be taken seriously—until it reached a $90 billion market cap. Popcat is now in a similar position, and with its low supply and growing adoption, it could be one of the most surprising breakouts of 2025. If the meme rally accelerates, some analysts speculate that Popcat could 5x or even 10x in price, making it one of the top new meme coins to join for 2025. While meme-based investing is high risk, the potential upside for Popcat is undeniable. Shiba Inu – The Meme Coin Expanding into DeFi and the Metaverse Once known as a Dogecoin rival, Shiba Inu has evolved into one of the most sophisticated meme coins in the industry. With the launch of Shibarium, its layer-2 blockchain, SHIB is now a key player in DeFi, gaming, and the metaverse, ensuring its long-term growth. One of Shiba Inu’s biggest moves has been its metaverse expansion, allowing users to buy digital land and interact within a decentralized virtual world. Unlike most meme coins, SHIB is building a sustainable ecosystem, integrating ShibaSwap (its decentralized exchange) and NFT utility to further drive adoption. With Shibarium reducing gas fees and transaction speeds, more projects are choosing to build within the SHIB ecosystem, boosting token demand. Some analysts predict that Shiba Inu could see a 500% surge in 2025, especially if its metaverse and gaming integrations gain mainstream adoption. For investors looking for a long-term hold, Shiba Inu’s continued expansion makes it a strong meme coin to bet on. Final Thoughts – The Clock Is Ticking for These Meme Coins The top new meme coins to join for 2025 are already making waves, and for those looking to maximize gains, timing is critical. Meme coin rallies move fast, and missing out on early entries often means missing out on the biggest profits. BTFD Coin is the clear standout, with its play-to-earn gaming ecosystem, massive staking APY, and presale price of just $0.00016. With only two stages left before launch, this is the last opportunity to buy before the price shoots up. Popcat is proving that meme culture is still one of the strongest forces in crypto, with a rapidly growing market cap and viral backing. If history repeats itself, Popcat could follow in Dogecoin’s footsteps and deliver unexpected gains. Shiba Inu continues to build beyond the meme coin label, expanding its metaverse, DeFi, and gaming integrations. With 500% price growth predictions, it remains one of the top meme coins for long-term investors. With BTFD Coin’s presale coming to a close, the final opportunity to buy at these prices is NOW. If you’re serious about catching the next 3,650% moonshot, the time to act is today—because once Stage 16 sells out, there’s no turning back.

BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme token—it integrates play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, allowing players to earn real crypto rewards. With 90% APY staking and a presale price of $0.00016, it’s one of the most profitable short-term plays in the market. Is Popcat a good investment for 2025? Popcat has built a massive viral following, making it one of the most talked-about meme coins of the year. If its current momentum continues, analysts predict it could see 5x or even 10x returns. Will Shiba Inu continue to grow in 2025? Shiba Inu’s Shibarium network, metaverse expansion, and DeFi integrations make it one of the most sustainable meme coin projects.

ETH might gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2,750 resistance zone. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $2,620 resistance level. The price is trading above $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,640 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,750 and $2,800. Ethereum Price Eyes Steady Increase Ethereum price remained supported above the $2,550 level, like Bitcoin . ETH formed a base and recently started a fresh increase above the $2,600 and $2,620 resistance levels. The bulls pumped the pair above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $2,794 swing high to the $2,614 low. The pair is now moving higher above the $2,680 level. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,640 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,700 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $2,794 swing high to the $2,614 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,750 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,800 or $2,820. A clear move above the $2,820 resistance might send the price toward the $2,920 resistance. An upside break above the $2,920 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,000 resistance zone or even $3,050 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,750 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,655 level or the 100 hourly SMA. The first major support sits near the $2,620 zone or the trend line. A clear move below the $2,620 support might push the price toward the $2,600 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,550 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,440.

After recently slipping below $100,000, the cryptocurrency now hovers around the $95,000 mark, causing uncertainty among investors. Despite these setbacks, some analysts see signs that the market’s bull cycle may still have room to run. CryptoQuant contributor MAC_D recently examined the current state of Bitcoin’s realized market capitalization, offering insights into what might lie ahead for the asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Struggle Below $100K: Could These Market Signals Trigger the Next Rally? Bitcoin Realized Cap as a Bullish Indicator According to Mac’s analysis, Bitcoin’s realized market capitalization—calculated by summing the value of each Bitcoin based on its last recorded transaction price—has reached an all-time high, surpassing $857 billion. This increase occurred even as Bitcoin’s price experienced a downturn. Traditionally, a rising realized cap indicates that coins are being sold by long-term holders and absorbed by new investors. This redistribution cycle often reflects a healthy, ongoing bull market rather than the end of one. Mac noted that the proportion of long-term holders who have held Bitcoin for more than six months currently stands at 39.74%, compared to 15.66% during the previous market peak. This higher percentage suggests that long-term holders remain active, and the market has yet to reach its zenith. While the data indicates that the bull cycle continues, external factors such as trade tensions and inflation could still influence short-term corrections. However, Mac believes these macroeconomic elements won’t derail the market’s long-term upward trajectory. The analyst wrote: The increase in realized market cap and the decrease in long-term holder ratio indicate that the market is still in a bull cycle. However, investors should also consider macroeconomic factors such as trade tensions and inflation. While these factors may lead to short-term corrections and periods of price stability, the long-term upward trend is expected to persist. Retail Activity Shows Signs of Revival In addition to realized cap metrics, other market indicators also suggest potential positive developments. Another CryptoQuant analyst, caueconomy, highlighted retail investor behavior as a key factor to watch. While retail demand for Bitcoin has been muted over the past month—declining by just 2% compared to a steeper 20% drop in January—there are signs that this normalization period is ending. Historically, increases in retail activity have coincided with improved market sentiment and short-term price rallies. If retail participation resumes, it could strengthen Bitcoin’s market structure and contribute to a broader recovery. Although Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase has tempered its recent performance, these underlying metrics provide some optimism for investors.

The biggest crypto exchange in the U.S. reported fourth-quarter revenue of $2.27 billion, a 130% jump from last year and well past the $1.88 billion analysts had expected, according to LSEG data. Net income? $1.3 billion, or $4.68 per share, compared to just $273 million, or $1.04 per share, a year ago. The surge came as a post-election crypto rally sent prices soaring, pushing trading volumes through the roof. The company’s transaction revenue hit $1.56 billion, more than double last year’s number, crushing Wall Street’s $1.29 billion forecast. Trading volume also exploded, reaching $439 billion, up 185% year over year. Retail traders fueled most of the action, with consumer trading volume skyrocketing 224%, while institutional trading rose 176%. Coinbase shares jumped 2% in extended trading after the earnings release. Trading frenzy fuels Coinbase’s record quarter Coinbase credited its monster quarter to rising crypto prices and extreme volatility. “The majority of the Y/Y growth in Trading Volume was driven by higher levels of Crypto Asset Volatility—particularly in Q1 and Q4—as well as higher average crypto asset prices,” the company wrote in its shareholder letter. The exchange pointed to two major catalysts: the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in Q1 2024 and the election of a pro-crypto President and Congress in Q4 2024. Both events fueled expectations of regulatory clarity, leading to a flood of spot crypto trading. Wall Street had been bracing for strong numbers, but the actual results went beyond what analysts had priced in. Coinbase’s earnings per share ($4.68) crushed estimates ($1.81), showing just how much trading activity accelerated in the final months of 2024. Robinhood’s earnings gave an early hint of Coinbase’s breakout quarter. The stock and crypto brokerage posted a 700% spike in crypto trading revenue and saw crypto volumes soar more than 400% in Q4. Robinhood’s stock surged 12% after its report, while Coinbase saw a 6% jump in sympathy. Analyst John Todaro of Needham called Robinhood’s earnings a strong indicator for Coinbase, noting that a massive wave of retail trading in November and December pushed revenue to unexpected highs. “We are expecting a strong Q4 from COIN after HOOD posted better-than-expected results,” he wrote in a note. Todaro is keeping an eye on retail trading fees, stablecoin adoption, and crypto legislation timelines as key drivers for Coinbase’s 2025 performance. Coinbase shifts focus beyond trading revenue Despite record-breaking trading activity, Coinbase is working to diversify its revenue streams. Trading still makes up 68.5% of total revenue, but the company wants to expand its subscription and services business. Revenue from subscriptions, which includes stablecoins, staking, custody, and Coinbase One, is projected to land between $685 million and $765 million in Q1 2025. One of the biggest drivers? USDC, the stablecoin issued by Circle, which has a revenue-sharing agreement with Coinbase. Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas told CNBC that USDC is well-positioned for growth as Congress moves closer to passing stablecoin legislation. “We can drive utility in this where we can drive more trading pairs on our own platforms denominated in USDC, which drives the liquidity, and the more liquidity you have in any asset, that drives more adoption,” she said. CEO Brian Armstrong doubled down on USDC’s potential. “Our stretch goal is to make USDC the number one stablecoin,” he said on the earnings call. Right now, USDC holds 26% of the stablecoin market, trailing Tether’s 67%, but Coinbase sees an opportunity to increase adoption through deeper liquidity and regulatory clarity. Looking ahead, Coinbase has already generated $750 million in trading revenue through February 11. Trading revenue is expected to remain in the mid-to-high teens as a percentage of net revenue in Q1 2025. Not all analysts are convinced the trading boom will continue at this pace. Todaro cautioned that the meme coin mania crash in January could weigh on February trading volumes and drag into Q2. Robinhood’s crypto volumes suggest a 15% drop in Q1 from Q4, which could indicate a similar slowdown for Coinbase. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev addressed the surge in crypto activity on his company’s earnings call, saying that nine different business lines generated over $100 million in annual revenue, with options, equities, and futures trading also driving growth. Net deposits for Robinhood hit $50 billion for the year, showing broader strength across asset classes, according to Vlad.

Klarna’s CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski made the announcement about that the firm plans to embrace cryptocurrency. The announcement came as the fintech prepares for an initial public offering and business expansion in the US. Klarna Bank explores crypto to increase its fintech offering Klarna Bank CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski has been vocal about his skepticism of crypto in the past, arguing that high transaction fees make it unsuitable for commerce. He has even dismissed digital currencies as a “decentralized ponzi.” Siemiatkowski recently made a tweet saying “Ok. I give up. Klarna and me will embrace crypto.” Ok. I give up. Klarna and me will embrace crypto! More to come Yes I know! This post will get a huge sigh and 2 views 😂 But it still feels historic. Last large fintech in the world to embrace it. Someone had to be last. And that’s a milestone as well of some sort… 🥳 — Sebastian Siemiatkowski (@klarnaseb) February 8, 2025 This announcement marks a striking turnaround for the Swedish fintech, which is currently preparing for its US initial public offering . It also reflects a trend of fintechs and traditional financial institutions reassessing the role and significance of digital assets in financial systems. Founded in 2005 by Siemiatkowski, Klarna has grown to become one of Europe’s most influential fintech companies, serving over 85 million customers and processing over $100 billion in transaction volume. The evolving regulatory landscape and the maturation of the digital assets market contribute to Klarna exploring cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins and Bitcoin. A crypto integration into Klarna’s payment systems could potentially boost the company’s transaction volume and improve efficiency. Siemiatkowski is also actively soliciting help and ideas from the crypto community. Industry voices like Mert Mumtaz , CEO of Helius Labs, the lead developer of the Solana ecosystem, have weighed in and invited him for a chat. Polygon blockchain’s X account has also welcomed Siemiatkowski and Klarna Bank. The pivot to integrate crypto comes at a pivotal moment for the company. It is currently expanding its reach into the US market, having filed for an IPO, which would push the company’s value between $15 and $20 billion. Traditional finance companies shifting to crypto Klarna Bank is not the first financial company to embrace crypto. Siemiatkowski even acknowledged in the tweet that they are the last large fintech company to embrace crypto. Established players like PayPal and Revolut, who were once against crypto, now offer a range of crypto services to their customers. Siemiatkowski had a change of mind after meeting with Klarna board member and Sequoia Capital partner Andrew Reed and crypto companies. His pivot reflects the evolving landscape of the crypto and financial industry. Big players on Wall Street have also modified their stances on crypto. Larry Fink of Blackrock had previously called Bitcoin an index of money laundering, but in 2023, he acknowledged its potential to revolutionize finance. Blackrock now runs the world’s largest Bitcoin fund. Ken Griffin of Citadel hedge fund said he made a mistake about BTC after he had previously said it was a jihadist call not to believe in the dollar. The increasingly friendly regulatory landscape combined with the election of a pro-crypto president, Donald Trump has made traditional finance companies more confident in cryptos. On January 23, 2025, Trump signed an executive orde r directing federal agencies to propose a regulatory framework for digital assets within 180 days. The directive also explicitly prohibits the issuance of central bank currencies. These Trump initiatives are expected to encourage further adoption of digital assets in the United States.

The operator of the largest US crypto trading platform reported a net income of $1.3b or $4.68 per share—up significantly from the $273m, or $1.04 per share, recorded in the same quarter last year. Donald Trump has pledged to turn the US into the “crypto capital of the planet .” In pursuit of this vision, he has filled key government roles with digital currency advocates. For instance, he appointed Paul Atkins —a well-known supporter of cryptocurrencies—to lead the Securities and Exchange Commission. This move sharply contrasts with former SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s “Wild West” depiction of the crypto industry. Moreover, this shift suggests a more crypto-friendly regulatory stance, potentially paving the way for increased blockchain innovation and investment in the US. $COIN absolute blowout!

Governments are leaning in, and we’re shaping the next chapter of crypto from trading to payments to consumer apps and beyond. 2025 is going to be a very good year,” he added. Coinbase Posts $2.3B Quarterly Revenue with Trading Still Dominating Coinbase reported quarterly revenue of $2.3b, marking a substantial 140% jump from the $953.8m recorded during the same period last year. Meanwhile, transaction revenue surged to $1.56b—more than double the previous figure and exceeding analysts’ predictions of $1.29b. Additionally, the company generated $750m in trading revenue up to Feb. 11 and now expects trading revenue to represent a mid- to high-teens percentage of net revenue this quarter. While the exchange is working to diversify its revenue streams beyond trading, trading still comprised 68.5% of its total revenue in Q4, primarily fueled by retail trader activity. Source: Coinbase New Asset Launches and Platform Upgrades Drive 24% MTU Increase During the quarter, Coinbase onboarded 13 new assets, including trending meme coins like PEPE and WIF, while also focusing on enhancing both the trading experience and platform stability. As a result, Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) surged by nearly 24% to reach 9.7m. Notably, almost half of Coinbase’s trading customers in Q4 were either newcomers or returning users after a year-long absence. On a broader scale, the company’s subscription and services revenue for 2024 climbed to $2.3b—a 64% year-over-year increase and roughly 4.5 times the level seen during the 2021 bull market. This growth was driven primarily by blockchain rewards, stablecoin transactions and the Coinbase One subscription service. Specifically, in the fourth quarter, subscription and services revenue rose to $641m, marking a 15% increase from the previous quarter. USDC Emerged As Fastest-Growing Stablecoin Coinbase’s stablecoin revenue declined by 9% quarter-over-quarter to $226 million in Q4, yet it climbed 31% year-over-year to reach $910m for the full year. In 2024, USDC emerged as the fastest-growing major stablecoin. Moreover, the fourth quarter saw revenue gains driven by a notable increase in both the average market cap of USDC and its presence in our product offerings. However, these gains were partially offset by lower effective interest rates and new entrants in the USDC ecosystem during Q4. During the earnings call, Brian Armstrong reiterated that the company’s “stretch goal is to make USDC the number one stablecoin.” The post Coinbase Q4 Revenue Soars Over 140% as Post-Election Crypto Rally Propels Prices appeared first on Cryptonews .",Finance News|Coinbase|Market,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|MARKET|USDC,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-02-14 04:37:35

Warren Buffett has stated that you simply take your dip when the tide rolls out. The MiCA regulation is the effort to order the chaotic crypto cosmos. The EU handed down this rule to clearly clarify how digital currencies are to be handled with. But how will this new regulation evolve or manifest in the crypto market in 2025 and beyond? In this article, you’ll see that several aspects of the impact of MiCA on the crypto market are based on investor protection and the promotion of innovation and stability. Key features of MiCA Several aspects of MiCA law enhance the crypto market. It will compel the firms dealing in the crypto market to first register and strictly adhere to specific guidelines. These new rules will be supervised by the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority). Concerning the emerging MiCA cryptocurrencies, their operations will be appropriately regulated for fairness and total transparency. This law will also address fraud and financial crimes. The European authorities want MiCA to serve as a haven for companies as well as for investors. It is the regulation established under MiCA that has been bringing more clarity to the reality of investment in crypto-assets in the EU market. Impact on crypto businesses MiCA regulations are going to hit businesses involved in cryptocurrencies. Companies will be subjected to new rules in order to penetrate the EU enforcing new AML crypto laws. This means getting necessary permits from authorities and fulfilling some criteria. ESMA MiCA will enforce the law on businesses, and this may help create a positive perception of the crypto market . Where some firms might encounter issues related to their growth, MiCA will provide clarity for improvement in the long term. It will bring more stability and must help to draw more investors. In 2024, the MiCA regulations became an important step towards the legalization of the crypto business in Europe. Effects on crypto investors The regulations highlighted under MiCA will affect crypto investors in a big way. Proposed objective rules are to be provided by MiCA. MiCA EU will offer more protection for those investing in cryptocurrencies by enforcing AML crypto laws. This is good because it’ll allow investors to be more confident within the market, whether they like it or not. MiCA law also prevents fraud, which makes it safer for investors than other countries. As more and more cryptocurrencies in the MiCA list are regulated, investors can feel more confident in their decisions. New data suggest MiCA could draw more retail customers and money to crypto, despite risks of over-reporting. MiCA role in stability The MiCA regulation timeline is expected to breathe some order into the crypto sphere. Establishing clear rules for the existence of MiCA will minimize market risks . ESMA will act, advise and supervise the market under the framework it developed, known as MiCA. This stability can draw other businesses and investors, and this is good for the whole cryptocurrency market. They also anticipate that MiCA will contribute to the stabilization of the environment in the future. Research proves that MiCA should increase the European crypto market’s size by 15 to 20% in the future. Compliance requirements under MiCA When it comes to MiCA law, companies will have to endure strict rules and norms. They need to be operationally clear and safeguard their customers. The guidelines provided by ESMA for MiCA will assist businesses in fulfilling these conditions. This compliance will give investors confidence in the market and encourage that all crypto-related companies follow the best practices. According to the current regulations of MiCA, companies will have to obtain the necessary licenses by 2024, and the industry is expected to follow the corporate governance rules. Impact of MiCA on innovation MiCA regulations may bring huge changes in crypto innovation. Having clear guidelines, the MiCA EU’s main intent must be to foster growth in the industry. Through the MiCA law, businesses have the assurance that they can come up with more financial products. It will also outline how MiCA cryptocurrencies must be employed and assist firms in developing innovative products in compliance with ESMA MiCA legislation. Therefore, new forms of utilization may appear, linking to the utilization of crypto in daily life through new technologies. This adaptation of MiCA can positively impact innovation in crypto and security tokens adopted by companies. Future prospects for MiCA As the MiCA regulations evolve, they can bring more certainty to the markets for crypto assets. The MiCA law will effectively create a safer environment for investors and increase their confidence in the market. In the long run, this organization may turn into an international reference in the regulation of the crypto market, and by adopting these rules, more investment, innovation and better growth may happen as well.

Besides, XRP price soared over 4% intraday, whereas Kaspa (KAS) pumped alongside to emerge as the day’s top gainer. Meme coins, on the other hand, mainly traded in the red zone. So, let’s take a closer look at some of the day’s most trending coins and their intraday price movements. Crypto Prices (Feb 14): BTC AT $97K, Altcoins Fluctuate After the recent U.S. CPI and PPI data release, the crypto market appears to be uncertain.

The flagship crypto sees a sluggish movement in light of broader market trends and macroeconomic factors. It’s worth mentioning that BTC recorded $28.83 million worth of liquidations over the past day, per Coinglass data. ETH Price At $2,700 Level ETH price slipped nearly 1% in the past 24 hours, now trading at $2,712. Ethereum’s intraday bottom and peak were $2,615.67 and $2,725.59, respectively.

Investors are constantly hunting for the next big thing, hoping to ride the wave of explosive gains. Recent market trends highlight two established players—Bonk and ACT I: The AI Prophecy—holding strong, while a brand-new sensation, Arctic Pablo Coin, sets the stage for an exhilarating presale journey. With its eye-popping $1.3 billion market cap, Bonk continues gaining traction among meme coin enthusiasts. Meanwhile, ACT I: The AI Prophecy has surged 5.65% in the past 24 hours, drawing attention from those looking for the next AI-powered revolution in crypto. However, the real showstopper is Arctic Pablo Coin , a groundbreaking meme coin that takes holders on an epic adventure through mythical landscapes, delivering an unprecedented wealth-generation opportunity. Meme coins are no longer just about the hype—they’re a lifestyle, an experience, and in the case of Arctic Pablo Coin, an immersive narrative that bridges myth and reality. This isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a movement, a grand expedition where every presale phase is tied to hidden locations, each revealing a new layer of the Arctic Pablo saga. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Gateway to Adventure and Wealth Deep in the icy expanse, where the world’s mysteries remain untouched, Arctic Pablo Coin embarks on a journey unlike any other. Armed with his legendary snowmobile, Pablo is more than an explorer—he’s a pioneer of uncharted riches. His latest discovery? The mythical $APC coins, shimmering with the promise of untold fortunes. Currently, Arctic Pablo has reached Aqua Frost, the ninth location in his quest, raising over $1.2 million in the presale so far. At a current price of $0.000059, early adopters stand to gain an astonishing 13,451.72% ROI when the coin launches at $0.008. That means a $100 investment today transforms into $13,559.32 at launch. Miss out, and the journey continues without you. Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t like other meme coins—there are no stages. Instead, each presale phase unlocks a new location in Pablo’s mythical expedition. Investors aren’t just buying a token; they’re joining a legendary pursuit for hidden wealth. But what truly fuels this journey? Scarcity and staking rewards. With a 66% APY staking program, holders can lock in rewards while their investment grows. And thanks to weekly token burns, unsold presale tokens are permanently removed, ensuring a deflationary supply. Every burn fuels demand, making each $APC more valuable over time. This isn’t just a meme coin; it’s an adventure that rewards those daring enough to join Pablo on his epic quest. Will Aqua Frost be the final frontier, or is there another location waiting to be unveiled? Only those who hold $APC will find out. Bonk: The Meme Coin That Refuses to Be Ignored Bonk has been a standout in the meme coin space, maintaining its position as one of the most talked-about digital assets. With a current market cap of $1.36 billion and a circulating supply of 77.2 trillion coins, Bonk isn’t just another flash in the pan—it’s a force to be reckoned with. Unlike Arctic Pablo Coin’s adventurous narrative, Bonk’s success rides on its community-driven movement. Originally created to reward Solana users, it has since evolved into a meme coin powerhouse. The recent 1.11% price increase shows that demand is still high, proving that Bonk has a dedicated investor base that believes in its long-term potential. Bonk’s strength lies in its rapid adoption within the Solana ecosystem. Bonk has established itself as a legitimate transaction medium from tipping services to NFT integrations. While it lacks the storytelling prowess of Arctic Pablo, its strong community ensures it remains relevant in the meme coin space. ACT I: The AI Prophecy – The Future of AI-Driven Meme Coins AI-powered cryptocurrencies are taking the market by storm, and ACT I: The AI Prophecy is leading the charge. With its price currently at $0.193211 and a 5.65% increase in the past 24 hours, this futuristic meme coin is making waves. Unlike Arctic Pablo’s adventure-based ecosystem or Bonk’s community-driven model, ACT I is built around AI innovation. This token taps into the booming AI trend, positioning itself as a hybrid meme-utility token with real-world applications. Its market cap of $183 million is relatively modest compared to Bonk, but it shows signs of steady growth. As AI continues to dominate tech discussions, ACT I: The AI Prophecy could see a major breakout, especially with institutional interest growing in AI-integrated blockchain solutions. However, despite its potential, ACT I doesn’t offer the same structured staking rewards or deflationary mechanisms as Arctic Pablo. While it appeals to AI enthusiasts, its ROI potential pales compared to Arctic Pablo’s projected 13,451.72% gains. Still, as the AI market expands, ACT I could see substantial long-term growth. Conclusion: Which Meme Coin Holds the Best Long-Term Potential? Based on research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin emerges as the most lucrative long-term opportunity. While Bonk and ACT I: The AI Prophecy offer stability and AI-driven innovation, neither matches Arctic Pablo’s explosive ROI potential, deflationary mechanics, or staking rewards. The adventure of Arctic Pablo isn’t just a gimmick—it’s a calculated, high-reward investment that turns meme coin hype into a legendary journey. With the presale still active at Aqua Frost, the clock is ticking. Those who join now stand to transform even a small investment into a life-changing fortune. Join the Arctic Pablo meme coin presale now before the next location is unlocked! For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs: Why is Arctic Pablo Coin considered a top new meme coin for long-term investment? It offers high ROI potential, scarcity, staking rewards, and a unique adventure-driven presale model. What are the staking rewards and potential ROI for Arctic Pablo Coin? 66% APY staking rewards with a projected 13,451.72% ROI upon launch. How does Bonk compare to Arctic Pablo Coin and ACT I: The AI Prophecy? Bonk has strong community backing, ACT I focuses on AI innovation, but Arctic Pablo offers the highest growth potential.

This technology is now being used to streamline other traditional industries after initially being earmarked to revolutionize the finance world by bringing with it the advent of a decentralized infrastructure. Since its inception, the blockchain industry has grown rapidly, and looks like it’ll keep going in this trajectory for some time to come. A forecast from December 2023 predicted the blockchain to reach a value of $943 billion in 2032 at a CAGR of 56.1%. This is down from an earlier prediction from June 2022, where blockchain technology was predicted to reach $1,235 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 82.8%. This articles aims to highlight the areas where blockchain is being used like Supply Chain Management, eSports, Real-World Assets (RWAs), Decentralized Finance (DeFi), etc, including emerging projects that are creating more accessible, efficient, and innovative solutions through the help of this disruptive technology. Evolution of Blockchain Technology When Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first block of Bitcoin, known as the genesis block, in January 2009, the blockchain was solely associated with cryptocurrency. You wouldn’t be looked at as weird if you thought that was the only use case. Over the last 15 years since then, the world has seen how the ability of this decentralized technology extends past digital currencies. However, the ride to this point hasn’t been as smooth—understandable for a new technology. There are key challenges that have impeded the rate of adoption of blockchain technology. Issues like scalability, data privacy, security, interoperability, financial regulations, etc have over time needed solutions for them. The user-friendliness and regulatory compliance of the solutions proffered are also vital for the continuous improvement and sustainability of the technology. In subsequent paragraphs, I’m going to highlight some of the industries experiencing top-shelf blockchain innovation and how they’re transforming user experiences in these industries. Real-World Assets Bridging Web2 and Web3 Blockchain gives investors access to (institutional and retail) traditional tangible assets like real estate, stocks, and other commodities in the form of digital tokens. This is a quality of the blockchain that I appreciate so much as it has done great for adoption. This technology has enabled accessibility, encouraged retail investors to get a piece of an asset via fractional ownership, increased liquidity in the industry, and improved transparency in asset trading. RWA tokenization was one of the top crypto narratives in 2024. According to a report by Tokenized Asset Coalition, the total value locked in tokenized assets for that year was over $176 billion. This marked a 32% year-to-date increase, with non-stablecoin assets growing by 53%. There looks to be a clear driving force behind the trend because, according to industry projections, the RWA industry can reach $30 trillion by 2030 . Some examples of RWAs that can be tokenized include Real Estate, Art and Collectibles, Commodities like gold and other raw materials, and Securities and Bonds. A project playing a key role in this sector is Joinn Finance. This is a platform that leverages advanced blockchain technology to ensure a seamless and secure user experience for users. The platform is making the complexities of Web3 approachable, just like how familiar Web2 applications are. Operating under a regulatory-compliant framework, Joinn offers innovative features like access to on-chain RWAs and USDC Mastercard for both retail and institutional users. Blockchain Scaling and Infrastructure Blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin are the foundation on which a majority of the disruptive solutions on the blockchains today were built. For instance, the Ethereum network is a leader in the development of smart contracts. This popularity as the go-to for smart contracts has resulted in increased demand, which results in network cloggings. Originally designed to process 12-15 transactions per second (TPS) and even though it processes around 20-30 TPS now, compared to traditional finance networks, this is quite slow. For instance, Visa can handle up to 24,000 TPS. This overload on blockchains like Ethereum results in network congestion, high transaction fees, and slow transaction speeds. AppLayer is a blockchain solution tackling this malaise. It is a C++ based Ethereum scaling solution that allows developers to deploy Solidity smart contracts and C++ programmed stateful pre-compiles as smart contracts. Smart contracts deployed with AppLayer are 10 times faster than others in competing networks like Golang for example. Stateful pre-compiles on the platform are also 65 times faster. Transforming Supply Chains Supply chains are the literal wheels that help industries all over the world move forward. So when an industry’s supply chain fails or isn’t working as well as it should, that quickly becomes a problem. And like with every sector, there are challenges in the management of these chains. Some examples of these challenges include shortages of both material and labor, global political instability, regulatory challenges, and rising costs of energy and fuel. A platform providing world-class blockchain solutions to challenges like these in supply chains is Libera. By leveraging blockchain technology and advanced AI tools, Libera is bridging the gap between traditional trade and modern commerce. The platform provides businesses with visibility into supply chains, customer behavior, and market trends that were previously difficult to access. Reimagining Decentralized Finance DeFi has come a long way in the last couple of years. We’ve seen use cases and solutions we didn’t know we needed in this sector to drive the adoption of blockchain technology. Many users now have access to financial instruments and services that they would have found difficult to access in traditional finance institutions. The DeFi sector currently holds $108.8 billion in Total Value Locked. While it is beyond impressive how well DeFi has worked so far, there are still a couple of challenges that the sector needs to overcome. One of them is the problem of Fragmentation. Fragmentation is the spread of liquidity and user activity across multiple isolated blockchain networks and DeFi protocols. This is a problem because it makes it difficult for users to access the best rates and opportunities in the market due to the absence of a unified and interconnected system. This leads to poor user experience and ultimately inefficiency. Instadapp, a company that has played a leading role in the DeFi landscape right since 2018 has come up with a solution for this problem: Fluid. A culmination of extensive development on top DeFi protocols, Fluid is an innovative base layer for new DeFi protocols to be built on. It allows users better utilities like improved rates, high loan-to-value (LTV), productive debt, and other improvements to come in the future. Fan Engagement and Entertainment According to a study by Mordor Intelligence, blockchain use in the sports industry will experience a 9% annual growth for the next five years, highlighting the rising popularity of the application of blockchain technology in sports. This application helps with the improvement of transparency, enhances fan interaction, and improves security measures. The fan token market cap at the time of writing is $214,330,179, with over 80 major sports organizations adopting blockchain solutions. OG ESports is a brilliant example of blockchain adoption in sports. This is one of the world’s most successful eSports teams, with multiple championship titles and millions of dollars in prize money won. They have an impressive list of achievements and recently introduced the OG ESports Fan Tokens on fan tokens platform Socios.com. Some of the perks of holding these tokens include benefits and rewards like VIP experiences, voting rights in team decisions, and discounts on merchandise. Conclusion All of these projects mentioned in this article demonstrate the potential of decentralized solutions to transform different industries. Addressing critical challenges like scalability, accessibility, supply chain management, and fan engagement, ensures that these projects are reshaping how we interact with digital ecosystems. The future of the blockchain is interconnected, user-centric solutions that will bridge the gaps between traditional systems and decentralized technologies.

The yet-to-launch crypto platform promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump and his sons also has 926.998M WLFI tokens remaining for sale. Onchain data revealed that the WLFI governance token currently has over 80,000 holders among 119,000+ transactions. The firm is also reportedly using Aave on the backend to run a segregated instance with stronger KYC controls than the original decentralized lending protocol. World Liberty Financial sells over 24B WLFI tokens World Liberty Financial appears to have sold more than 96% of its tokens after an initial slow start about four months ago. A chart on its website shows that it has sold more than 24 billion of its WLFI governance tokens, with fewer than 1 billion of the tokens yet to be sold. As per WLF’s official site, each WLFI token costs $0.05, making the total sale come to around $1.25 billion. WLFI tokens went on sale in mid-October, with plans to raise $300 million at a $1.5 billion valuation through the initial token sale. The crypto project had an initial plan to offer 20% of its 100 billion WLFI tokens after launching its DeFi platform in September last year. WLF later decided to extend its token sale by 5% to capitalize on the rapid uptake of tokens at increasing price points and raise more funds for its ongoing development. “We’re making routine movements of our crypto holdings as part of regular treasury management and payment of fees and expenses and to address working capital requirements. To be clear, we are not selling tokens–we are simply reallocating assets for ordinary business purposes.” – World Liberty Financial . The crypto project maintained that the sale was intended to be part of maintaining a strong, secure, and efficient treasury. WLFI also argued that the routine movements of WLFI tokens was just standard practice for managing operations at WLFI. WLF’s official site highlights that WLFI tokens play a key governance role within the platform beyond fundraising. WLFI holders have voting rights on community proposals, which allows them to influence the future direction of the project. The tokens are also non-transferable and cannot be sold or traded, which ensures they are used exclusively for governance purposes. WLF disclosed that the Trump family held a majority stake in the project and is entitled to 75% of its revenue and a number of tokens. The surge in the project’s sales follows its recent announcement of a strategic token reserve designed to mitigate market volatility. World Liberty Financial reveals a strategic token reserve World Liberty Financial announced on Wednesday their strategic token reserve called “Macro Strategy.” The firm acknowledged that the initiative was designed to bolster leading projects like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other digital assets. WLF said it aims to mitigate market volatility and ensure a resilient financial ecosystem by diversifying their holdings across a spectrum of tokenized assets. The Trump-backed project revealed that the reserve will empower investments in innovative projects within the DeFi landscape. Macro Strategy is also aimed to support the DeFi ecosystem development and seize emerging opportunities in the space. The crypto project also said it made strategic partnerships with traditional financial institutions to contribute tokenized assets to their reserve. WLF highlighted that partnerships with traditional financial institutions will provide institutions with transparent exposure to the crypto community. The firm also added that the partnerships will help institutions to directly engage with WLF’s community for innovative market opportunities. WLF currently holds significant positions in various cryptocurrencies, such as $48.39 million of Ethereum, $9 million of Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC), and $9.8 million of Tron (TRX). The firm also acquired 342,000 ONDO tokens for $470,000 USDC and expanded its ETH holdings through a $5 million Coin swap. Srikumar Misra, founder of AI crypto protocol Aarna, said that not everything had gone smoothly for WLF. Misra revealed that WLFI’s recent purchases of multiple tokens had led to losses exceeding $21.78M. The Indian serial entrepreneur added that a major hit came from buying 56,317 ETH at $3,373 per ETH, which led to a $14M loss.

As the market moves beyond dog-themed coins, Panshibi (SHIBI) is emerging as a serious contender with its 100x potential. Built on a fusion of Asian culture, AI, and Social-Fi, Panshibi offers much more than just a viral name. With its presale already gaining momentum, experts predict massive gains for early investors. Could this be the meme coin that outshines Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The Rise and Challenges of Meme Coins Despite initial misconception meme coins function as legitimate financial instruments that leave no doubt about their impact on the market. Dogecoin along with Shiba Inu and Floki Inu managed to grow substantial communities yet their single shared drawback is being utility-less. An early investor gained exponential returns while people who entered later faced high volatility in their investments. New players in the crypto market seek cryptocurrency projects combining popular memes with tangible practical applications. While dog-themed tokens have dominated, they lack innovation. Investors want more than just a speculative token; they need real use cases and a long-term vision. This is where Panshibi (SHIBI) steps in, offering a fresh perspective by merging meme culture with blockchain functionality. PANSHIBI 100x Potential : A Meme Coin With a Purpose Unlike typical meme coins, Panshibi (SHIBI) isn’t just about hype, it’s about creating a new standard for meme-based crypto projects. With a Social-Fi and AI ecosystem, the project goes beyond just being a token. Access to special staking functions as well as governance rights and community-developed initiatives exists for token holders to contribute their input on upcoming ideas. The main obstacle toward crypto adoption stems from its unsustainable operation over the long term. Many meme coins crash because they offer nothing beyond speculative trading. Panshibi (SHIBI) is different. With a 10-year liquidity lock, it provides security and stability that many competitors lack. This long-term vision ensures that early adopters won’t face the same pump-and-dump schemes that have plagued the meme coin space. The SHIBI meme coin also stands out due to its ambitious presale model. The price is set to increase by 1,200% during presale, allowing early investors to benefit from a structured and predictable rise in value. With expert predictions suggesting a 145,000% surge post-launch, Panshibi could be the breakout star of 2025. Why Investors Are Betting on Panshibi (SHIBI) Beyond the massive PANSHIBI 100x potential investors are drawn to the project’s ability to solve real issues in the crypto space. Meme coins often lack governance and long-term incentives, but Panshibi addresses this with exclusive staking rewards for SHIBI holders, governance system that allows community-driven decisions, AI integration bringing intelligent automation into Social-Fi interactions. These factors give Panshibi an edge over traditional meme coins, making it a project designed for both long-term investors and short-term traders. Presale Details and How to Get Involved The SHIBI meme coin is currently in its presale phase, offering early investors the chance to buy in before the anticipated price explosion. The structured presale framework of Panshibi distinguishes itself from standard meme coins since it provides sustainable price appreciation which differs from the standard hype-driven models. The founding mission requires establishment of $10 million funding within 60 days in order to establish a vibrant launch year performance. The crypto assets in this platform face 10-year locking period which guarantees investors will not face abrupt market exits nor experience rug pulls. The design of the project targets retail clients and institutional investors who seek access to the upcoming meme coin trend. The PANSHIBI 100x potential is more than just speculation; it’s backed by a solid roadmap, strong community engagement, and real utility. With meme coins evolving beyond just internet jokes, SHIBI meme coin is positioning itself as the next major player in the space. Investors who missed out on Dogecoin or Shiba Inu now have a chance to enter a new movement before it goes mainstream. Don’t wait to join the SHIBI meme coin presale today and be part of the next crypto revolution.

The TRUMP token came into existence during the Donald Trump inauguration triggering massive frenzy and is already the fourth-largest meme coin after Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe Coin (PEPE). Following Hayes’s prediction, the TRUMP price is already up by 5% trading at $16.40. Why TRUMP Meme Coin Will Lead Bitcoin? In his recent blog post, Arthur Hayes wrote that meme coins would shape the U.S. political landscape as they could be a powerful tool leveraged for political advertising. He further predicts that the 2026 mid-term elections in the United States will witness the rise of numerous personal political brands propelled by meme coins. Hayes said that meme coins provide a unique way for politicians to engage with voters by blending entertainment and political messaging. The former BitMEX CEO said that US President Donald Trump checks the TRUMP meme coin price. Hayes further speculated that if market sentiment around cryptocurrencies improves, tokens like the TRUMP coin could outperform major assets like Bitcoin, signaling a shift in how political narratives are shaped and financed. In his blog post, Hayes wrote : “$TRUMP is down roughly 80% from its high, and Bitcoin has not retaken $110,000 (the level it reached at the height of $TRUMP mania). I believe that if crypto sentiment is improving, $TRUMP will lead Bitcoin. If some policy that those in the political know believe will positively impact crypto, $TRUMP will surge well before the positive news is announced, and then Bitcoin will follow”. Interestingly, Arthur Hayes also predicts that Xi Jinping, leader of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), will also launch his meme coin eventually, if not immediately. “At some point, Xi will determine he needs to show the people that everyone knows he is popular,” wrote Hayes. TRUMP Price Rally to Continue? Prominent cryptocurrency analyst Crypto Bull has highlighted the current price action of TRUMP meme coin token, noting it is “retesting now” at key support levels. In a statement on social media, the analyst expressed confidence in the token’s growth prospects, stating: “Buying this below $16 is free money. I’m not selling for less than a 2x from here.” Source: Crypto Bull Previously, Arthur Hayes had also predicted a Bitcoin price crash to $70,000 amid tightening liquidity conditions and a sticky inflationary environment. BTC price has been struggling recently to move past $100K levels and is currently trading at $96,727.

XRP May Have Broken Out Of A Symmetrial Triangle In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has discussed about a long-term consolidation pattern that XRP may have been traveling inside until recently. The formation in question is a Symmetrical Triangle from technical analysis (TA), which, as its name suggests, is shaped like a triangle. The pattern involves two trendlines within which the price consolidates, with a core feature being that these two levels approach each other at a roughly equal and opposite slope (hence the ‘symmetrical’ in the name). The upper line of the triangle is made by joining together lower highs in the asset and the lower one by connecting higher lows. Just like with other consolidation patterns in TA, the former is likely to provide resistance and the latter support. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could End Up Plummeting To $80,100 If This Support Fails As the consolidation of the cryptocurrency continues inside the triangle, it gets narrower since the trendlines approach convergence. A break out of the pattern starts to become more likely as this happens. When the breakout occurs above the upper trendline, the coin could be assumed to be heading toward a bullish outcome. On the other hand, a fall below the lower level can be considered a bearish signal. The Symmetrical Triangle is just one of the triangle patterns that exist in TA. Two other popular types include the Ascending and Descending Triangles, which occur when one of the trendlines is parallel to the time-axis (the upper one in case of the former and the lower for the latter). Now, here is the chart shared by Martinez, that highlights a potential Symmetrical Triangle that the weekly price of XRP had potentially been stuck inside during the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the weekly price of XRP may have been following a long-term Symmetrical Triangle pattern between 2018 and November of last year. As mentioned before, a breakout becomes probable as the asset approaches the apex of the triangle and this is exactly what appears to have happened with the cryptocurrency as its price found a sharp surge above the triangle in November. “If this is a symmetrical triangle, XRP has broken out and is targeting $15!” notes the analyst. The target is based on the fact that breaks out of the pattern are usually of a similar scale as the height of the triangle (the vertical line). Related Reading: Bitcoin Unable To Break Upward As 1.6 Million BTC Resistance Wall Blocks Path From the current price of the coin, a rally to this level would imply a rally of a whopping 517%. It now remains to be seen whether the pattern would hold for XRP or not. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around the $2.43 level, up more than 1% over the last 24 hours.

The price is rising and might aim for a fresh move toward the $750 resistance. BNB price is moving higher above the $650 resistance zone. The price is now trading above $665 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $660 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance). The pair must stay above the $650 level to start another increase in the near term. BNB Price Eyes Fresh Rally After forming a base above the $600 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $620 and $650 resistance levels. It even rallied above the $700 level, beating Ethereum and Bitcoin . The price traded as high as $732 and recently saw a downside correction. There was a move below the $700 support level. The price dipped below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $596 swing low to the $732 high. The price is now trading above $650 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $660 on the hourly chart of the BNB/USD pair. The trend line is close to the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $596 swing low to the $732 high. If there is a fresh increase, the price could face resistance near the $700 level. The next resistance sits near the $720 level. A clear move above the $720 zone could send the price higher. In the stated case, BNB price could test $732. A close above the $732 resistance might set the pace for a larger move toward the $750 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $800 level in the near term. Another Decline? If BNB fails to clear the $700 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $665 level. The next major support is near the $650 level. The main support sits at $635. If there is a downside break below the $635 support, the price could drop toward the $620 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $600 level. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $665 and $650.

The Cupertino-based giant has assembled teams in the United States and China to tackle engineering challenges and satisfy Chinese regulations, according to people familiar with the matter. Alibaba is helping Apple create an on-device system that will filter and adjust the company’s models to comply with government requirements. Baidu, sometimes referred to as China’s Google, will handle other tools, including a feature called Visual Intelligence for the upcoming iPhone 16. Apple’s decision follows a sharp drop in iPhone sales in China—its largest market outside the US—and local rivals have drawn users away with their own technology. Company representatives declined to comment, but Alibaba Chairman Joe Tsai confirmed on Thursday that his firm was part of the project. Meanwhile, Apple is preparing its next suite update for April through iOS 18.4, which will include new language support, although a full platform launch remains slated for later this year.

This time, reports suggest he is aligning himself with Donald Trump’s crypto advisory board—an unexpected move given his past political leanings and regulatory stance. Hinman, who previously played a key role in shaping crypto regulations, was known for his 2018 speech declaring Bitcoin and Ethereum not securities while leaving other projects in uncertain territory. His shift toward Trump’s camp is raising eyebrows, according to Laura Loomer, a political activist and Journalist. https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/1890115086330786170 From Regulator to Industry Insider Hinman’s history is deeply tied to the regulatory framework that has shaped the crypto industry. His tenure at the SEC was marked by scrutiny over potential conflicts of interest, particularly due to his connections with Ethereum and financial ties to Simpson Thacher, a law firm linked to the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance. Many in the industry accused him of favoring Ethereum while leaving other cryptocurrencies in a regulatory gray area. His recent move suggests he may be trying to reposition himself within the pro-crypto scene. Laura Loomer also pointed out that while William Hinman worked at the SEC under Trump, he was actively supporting his political opponents. She highlighted that Hinman donated large sums to both Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, including contributions to Clinton’s PAC, the Hillary Victory Fund. A Play for Influence? One of the key moments fueling speculation was Hinman’s attendance at the Crypto Ball , an exclusive event celebrating Trump’s new pro-crypto stance . Given that Hinman had previously supported figures who opposed Trump, his sudden presence in these circles has led to speculation that he may be attempting to rebrand himself as an ally to the industry. Moreover, Hinman’s connections to Silicon Valley, including his advisory role at venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz, add another layer of intrigue. With the Trump administration’s increasing focus on blockchain innovation , industry leaders are jockeying for influence, and Hinman appears to be doing the same. While his regulatory expertise is valuable, some question whether his intentions are aligned with the industry’s best interests or if this is simply a strategic career move. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : CFTC and SEC Consider Joint Strategy for U.S. Crypto Regulations , The Crypto Community Remains Skeptical The crypto community remains divided on Hinman’s new alliance.

40306752,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=674373,1739510436,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40306752.jpeg,Judge puts SEC’s Binance lawsuit on hold for 60 days,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/judge-puts-secs-binance-lawsuit-on-hold/,"On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson granted the joint motion to stay the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance for 60 days. Both Binance and the SEC had submitted a joint filing to the court late on Monday requesting a hold on the lawsuit, citing possible changes under the new commission’s task force could affect the outcome of the case . Binance hopes they can do away with the case eventually, saying the case was baseless In their court filing, the parties argued that the SEC’s task force formed last month to review and formulate crypto regulations may “impact and facilitate the potential resolution of this case.” A spokesperson for Binance even commented on the stay filing, saying: “The SEC’s case has always been without merit, and we are eager to put this behind us and to continue our focus on keeping Binance the most secure, licensed, and trusted exchange in the world.” However, former SEC official Corey Frayer opposed the stay filing, saying that holding out on a case in which the CEO already pled guilty to his criminal charges and the commission already had an employee who admitted to the infringement of the securities laws may lead to a “full dereliction of duty.” In June 2023, the SEC filed 13 charges against Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao and the exchange, accusing them of running unregistered exchanges, manipulating markets, failing to restrict US investors from the exchange’s services, and misleading investors on its market surveillance controls. In November 2023, Binance’s Zhao pled guilty to his money laundering charges and served time in jail for it. While some are still displeased with the SEC, Washington DC federal judge Amy Berman approved the stay request, temporarily stopping the case for the next 60 days. The crypto industry is optimistic about the SEC’s republican leadership Meanwhile, the SEC’s involvement in the stay request has turned some heads in the crypto industry. Some saw it as the SEC’s change to a more crypto-friendly stance under the task force’s new commissioner, Hester Peirce. The joint filing also showed that the commission is reviewing existing cases against crypto firms, particularly those in which the previous administration had claimed that crypto tokens should be treated similarly to securities. On Tuesday, at an event of the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, Peirce claimed that they’ve been doing it wrong by having the enforcement division come up with crypto policies. President Trump has nominated lawyer and pro-crypto supporter Paul Atkins for the SEC chair position. Atkins has yet to be confirmed by Congress, but the SEC has already begun changing its approach to crypto under its existing Republican leadership.

Massachusetts, Ohio, Texas, Illinois, Arizona, Iowa, Maryland, New Mexico North Carolina, and Florida among others have already introduced Bitcoin reserve bills , and more (like Utah and Montana) are debating drafting theirs, as you can see in the image below. Source: @matthew_sigel on X The proposed plans would funnel state money into reserve funds and pension plans, with investments ranging from $50 million to over $8.7 billion per state, depending on how much cash they’re willing to commit. On January 23, just 3 days after president Donald Trump’s inauguration, he signed an executive order creating a federal crypto advisory council. Standing beside Trump in the Oval that day was David Sacks, the White House Crypto Czar, who then shared that the advisory council “evaluating” a national Bitcoin strategic reserve, as Cryptopolitan reported . During his campaign, Trump promised to make America a leader in Bitcoin and called himself the “crypto president.” Right now, he is working to reverse SEC policies that restricted digital assets and is setting up new rules to support Bitcoin adoption, according to a report from Bloomberg. Some states like Maryland plan to buy Bitcoin using general state funds, while others like North Dakota are looking at donations, gifts, and even seized criminal assets to fund their reserves. While lawmakers fight over Bitcoin investments, crypto fraud is skyrocketing. A Chainalysis report released yesterday estimates that crypto scam revenue hit $9.9 billion in 2024. That number is expected to rise to $12.4 billion as more scam wallets are uncovered. One of the most profitable scams was pig butchering, where scammers pose as investors or romantic partners, build trust through social media and dating apps, and trick victims into putting their money into fake crypto schemes. According to the report, once the money is sent, the scammer vanishes. Elad Fouks, head of fraud products at Chainalysis, said scammers are using Generative AI to make their operations more convincing and harder to detect. “GenAI enables the generation of realistic fake content, including websites and listings, to power investment scams, purchase scams, and more, making these attacks more convincing and harder to detect,” Fouks said. As states move toward buying Bitcoin, scams and fraud continue to rise, creating a high-stakes environment for both governments and crypto markets.

In contrast, Remittix (RTX) is showcasing a more durable trajectory, boasting 3x gains so far this year and continued momentum. With almost $12 million raised and more than 460 million tokens sold Remittix is priced around $0.0539 and has outpaced the hype-laden tokens by delivering real-world utility. Below is a closer look at how Remittix (RTX) keeps outperforming PEPE and SHIB and why it could remain on top for the rest of 2025. PEPE & SHIB: Spectacular Runs, Swift Corrections PEPE and Shiba Inu turned heads by multiplying in value seemingly overnight, minting early adopters into overnight millionaires. The flipside of that success? Extreme volatility. Both meme coins rely on social-media stunts, viral tweets, and the fervor of online communities. As soon as influencer hype dies or new meme coins flood the scene, capital rotates elsewhere, and prices correct—often brutally. While PEPE and SHIB both attempt to expand with NFT collections or DeFi utilities, these moves can appear reactive rather than organic. That’s not to say PEPE and SHIB lack dedicated communities; each has thousands of loyal holders who bet on another wave of mania. But the short shelf life of meme-craze surges leaves many investors wary. As a result, seasoned traders eye altcoins with day-to-day relevance, hoping to skip the whiplash typical of purely hype-driven tokens. Remittix (RTX): A Practical, PayFi-Centric Approach So why does Remittix (RTX) leave tokens like PEPE and SHIB in its dust? The key is that Remittix (RTX) solves an actual pain point: the high fees and complexities of cross-border transactions. Rather than depending on comedic branding or influencer tweets, Remittix (RTX) taps into the everyday remittance market—families, freelancers, and small businesses that regularly transfer money worldwide. The altcoin’s “PayFi” model bridges fiat and crypto seamlessly, allowing wallet-to-cash solutions that drastically reduce overhead. Already, Remittix (RTX) has surpassed $11.8 million in raised capital and sold 460 million tokens, priced near $0.0539. This success story suggests the altcoin’s demand stems from more than a passing meme mania. If global kiosk integrations or local wallet partnerships follow, user adoption might expand in regions hungry for cheaper wire transfers. In that scenario, 3x gains could be just the start, while meme coins remain at the mercy of fleeting hype cycles. Riding the Wave of Real Utility Unlike PEPE or SHIB—where price surges often hinge on a random celebrity tweet—Remittix (RTX) builds on a backbone of consistent user-driven demand. Each new holder who ditches old-school wire services for Remittix (RTX) fosters fresh liquidity and transaction volume. As more mainstream audiences discover they can preserve more of their earnings by using PayFi tokens, the altcoin’s upward trend gets reinforced, boosting price stability and growth potential. Analysts say this approach can keep Remittix (RTX) well-positioned even if the broader crypto market hits turbulence. While hype-based tokens sink when the meme fizzles, utility-focused altcoins usually hold firm. This resilience not only protected Remittix (RTX) in earlier dips, but propelled it to 3x gains so far—outperforming flashier but less grounded meme coins. Conclusion: Remittix Poised for Ongoing Dominance PEPE and Shiba Inu made headlines with astonishing short-term run-ups, but their reliance on viral buzz often leads to abrupt crashes. Remittix (RTX), on the other hand, thrives on simplifying cross-border finance, an everyday concern for millions worldwide. With more than $11.8 million raised and a rapidly expanding user base, the token’s 3x surge is likely just the beginning of its potential. In a market starved for real solutions, the odds favor PayFi altcoins like Remittix (RTX) to continue outperforming purely meme-centric rivals. For investors tired of riding the meme-coin rollercoaster, shifting focus to tangible-value projects may be the smarter long-term play. Ready to Explore Remittix (RTX)?

Edward believes this market cycle is very different for XRP and advised the community to have a strategy for cashing out when necessary. Jikh’s video , shared with over 2.5 million subscribers, provides a detailed analysis of XRP’s market potential, examining factors such as institutional adoption, regulatory developments, and financial infrastructure integration. This cycle is very different for $XRP . This mainstream finance YouTuber with over 2 million subscribers published the following video today. Reminder, have a cash out plan. pic.twitter.com/TfLmZdUW6n — Tony Edward (Thinking Crypto Podcast) (@ThinkingCrypto1) February 13, 2025 XRP’s Market Performance and Adoption Jikh began by acknowledging his initial skepticism toward XRP but explained that further research led him to recognize its potential. His journey mirrors veteran trader Peter Brandt, who initially stood against the digital asset, but has now seen its potential and become a strong supporter . Jikh disclosed in the video that he holds 3,681 XRP purchased in 2017 and emphasized that his investment represents only a small fraction of his overall portfolio. His analysis focused on multiple catalysts for price growth. One of the key developments he highlighted is the increasing adoption of XRP in Japan . According to a recent NASDAQ report, 80% of Japanese banks could embrace XRP this year. Given Japan’s strong technological and financial infrastructure, this level of adoption could significantly increase demand for XRP. The Impact of ETFs and Institutional Interest Jikh also discussed the potential approval of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF). If approved, an XRP ETF would allow institutional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency. He drew comparisons to Bitcoin’s price surge following its ETF approval. Despite the uncertainty, Jikh believes an ETF could increase liquidity and mainstream adoption of XRP. He also emphasized Ripple’s ongoing efforts to integrate XRP into global financial systems, particularly through partnerships with banks and financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Integration with SWIFT and ISO 20022 Compliance Another significant point in Jikh’s analysis is Ripple’s integration with SWIFT. He noted that SWIFT facilitates over $150 trillion in annual transactions, and XRP’s potential role in this system could drive substantial demand. Additionally, he highlighted XRP’s compliance with ISO 20022, the global messaging standard for financial institutions. With banks required to adopt this standard soon, XRP’s compatibility could position it as a key player in the evolving financial landscape. Jikh highlighted multiple factors, like RLUSD, the XRP Ledger’s superiority in the crypto market, and more. He analyzed the feasibility of XRP reaching $100, estimating it would require a market capitalization of approximately $5.7 trillion. He acknowledged that this is ambitious but argues it’s possible if XRP gains substantial adoption in banking and financial systems.

On Feb. 13, the SEC accepted Grayscale’s Form 19b-4 filings for the Grayscale XRP Trust and Grayscale Dogecoin Trust. This acknowledgment means the agency will soon begin its review, with a decision required within 240 days. The official countdown will start once the filings are published in the SEC’s federal register, a process that typically occurs within a few days. If entered now, the final decision would be expected around mid-October. In recent weeks, the SEC has also acknowledged applications for spot Litecoin and Solana ETFs, signaling a shift in its stance toward crypto-related investment products under the Trump administration. Under former SEC Chair Gary Gensler, the commission rejected at least two Solana ETF applications, while Grayscale had to fight a lengthy court battle to push for the approval of its Bitcoin trust conversion into an ETF. Bloomberg ETF analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas recently estimated that the odds of approval for an XRP ETF stand at 65%, while Dogecoin has a 75% chance before the end of 2025. “The pair have also given 90% odds of a Litecoin ETF being approved before the end of the year.” XRP’s approval could be complicated by ongoing legal uncertainty. Seyffart has suggested that an ETF wouldn’t move forward until the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple Labs is resolved. Dogecoin, however, may have an easier path since it shares similarities with Bitcoin, which has already been approved for ETFs. The SEC has not suggested Dogecoin could be classified as a security, potentially making approval more straightforward.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,REGULATION|DOGE|XRP|BTC|LTC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-02-14 05:36:14

The agency filed a regulatory notice seeking public input on the proposed rule change for the Grayscale XRP Trust under NYSE Arca Rule 8.201-E. Soon after, it requested comments on Grayscale’s Dogecoin Trust. SEC’s Evolving Approach Sparks Hope These developments indicate that the SEC is now more open to crypto innovations. It marks a clear shift from December, when exchanges withdrew their Solana 19b-4 applications after minimal engagement from the previous SEC leadership.

However, the SEC’s initial acknowledgment is a promising sign for their future launch. Further, as the crypto market continues to mature, the SEC will also likely consider XRP ETF applications from later entrants like Bitwise, 21Shares, Canary and WisdomTree. Once Grayscale’s ETF filing is published in the Federal Register, the SEC will commence its formal review period, which can extend up to 240 days. In essence, the countdown for the SEC to approve or reject the proposal begins as soon as the filing appears in this official government publication, marking a critical step in the regulatory process. Analyst Highlights SEC’s Break from Past Rigidity Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart observed that the SEC’s recent acknowledgment marks a clear departure from its previous stance, noting that filings like Solana’s were effectively denied as recently as December. “It means there’s a chance,” he said. Earlier this week, he forecast that the SEC would formally recognize XRP and Dogecoin ETFs within days. He estimated approval odds of 70% for XRP and 65% for Dogecoin. He also projected even higher probabilities for a Litecoin ETF at 90% and a Solana ETF at 70%. However, Seyffart also mentioned that an XRP ETF remains unlikely until the ongoing Ripple litigation with the SEC is resolved. Recently, the SEC acknowledged applications from Canary, VanEck, Bitwise and 21Shares for spot Solana ETFs and sought public feedback.

Trading volume jumped to $439 billion, and institutional revenue grew 155% to $141.3 million. Meanwhile, Trump’s administration is reshaping the crypto regulatory landscape by nominating Brian Quintenz to lead the CFTC and Jonathan Gould to head the OCC. Both are seen as crypto-friendly picks. Coinbase Earnings Soar in Q4 Coinbase reported its strongest quarterly earnings in over a year, driven by a surge in crypto prices and trading activity after the election of US President Donald Trump. The company’s financial results for the fourth quarter were released on Feb. 13, and revealed total revenue of $2.3 billion, which was an 88% increase quarter-over-quarter. Net income stood at $1.3 billion, which also surpassed analyst expectations. Trading volume surged to $439 billion, exceeding estimates of $404 billion, while consumer transaction revenue saw a 178% increase to $1.35 billion. Institutional revenue also grew by 155% over the same period to reach $141.3 million. (Source: Coinbase ) The company attributed its year-over-year trading volume growth to heightened crypto asset volatility, particularly in the first and fourth quarters of 2024, alongside higher average crypto prices. Coinbase also recorded $225.9 million in stablecoin revenue and $214.9 million in blockchain rewards revenue. After the earnings announcement, Coinbase shares rose 8.44% to $298.1 during regular trading hours but experienced some volatility in after-hours trading by slipping 0.88% to $295.01, according to Google Finance data . Coin Metrics projected that Coinbase’s revenue will more than double year-over-year, largely due to increased trading activity in the post-election market environment. They specifically pointed to the renewed optimism fueled by Trump’s pro-crypto stance and his commitment to making the United States a leading hub for the industry. The majority of trading volume, however, continues to stem from institutional participants, as retail investor activity stayed subdued. Data from crypto research firm Kaiko indicated that retail traders accounted for only 18% of Coinbase’s trading volume, down from 40% in 2021. Despite its continued reliance on trading, Coinbase has made a lot of progress in expanding its revenue from subscriptions and services. The company is still primarily a trading platform, with trading activity still contributing over 50% of total revenue, according to Kaiko . However, analysts pointed to emerging growth in Coinbase’s subscription-based businesses. Coinbase subscription revenue increasing: Kaiko ) The supply of the US dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC on the exchange grew by 23% in the fourth quarter, providing a tailwind for stablecoin-related revenue. At the same time, Coinbase’s Ethereum staking platform struggled with declining staking participation, and experienced a net outflow of close to 1.3 million ETH in Q4. A more favorable regulatory climate under Trump could provide long-term benefits for Coinbase’s staking business, according to industry researchers. The exchange has faced a lot of regulatory scrutiny from the SEC but may see relief under the new administration. Analysts at Morningstar see the election results as a positive development for the firm. Looking ahead, Coinbase is also pushing forward with its international expansion plans. The company is currently in discussions with Indian regulators about a potential return to the market after stopping operations in the country in 2023. Brian Quintenz Accepts Trump’s CFTC Nomination Trump is not only the cause of major changes on crypto exchanges, he is also planning on changing the crypto industry as a whole. Brian Quintenz, US President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), announced his nomination on the Web3 social media platform Farcaster. Quintenz’ nomination could be the start of a major shift in the agency’s stance on cryptocurrency regulation. Quintenz currently serves as head of policy for the Web3 venture firm a16z Crypto, and stated on Feb. 12 that he was accepting Trump’s nomination to lead the CFTC. This is the second most powerful financial regulator in the United States after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). His announcement is part of the sharp departure from the regulatory approach under former US President Joe Biden, whose administration pursued more than 100 lawsuits against crypto firms for alleged legal violations. After Trump’s administration took over on Jan. 20, the tone towards cryptocurrency seems to be shifting. Quintenz shared in his post that the CFTC is in a strong position to ensure the United States leads in blockchain technology and innovation. He also shared the announcement on X . Farcaster has become a prominent platform in the Web3 community. In 2024, a16z led a $150 million funding round for the decentralized social media network, which is hosted on Ethereum and has around 50,000 daily active users. The platform is primarily used by the Web3 community and serves as a foundation for various applications. Matt Hougan , chief investment officer at Bitwise, reacted to the news by predicting a positive impact on DeFi assets, and described Quintenz as a strong supporter of decentralized finance. Before officially taking the role, Quintenz has to go through a Senate hearing and win approval through a vote. If confirmed, he will replace Rostin Behnam as the head of the CFTC. In 2021, he joined the board of Kalshi, a crypto-friendly prediction market that successfully sued the CFTC under Biden’s administration to gain the right to list political betting contracts. He later joined a16z as head of policy in 2022. Quintenz is no stranger to the CFTC after he served as a Republican commissioner from August of 2017 to September of 2021. His nomination follows Trump’s December selection of Paul Atkins, another former commissioner, to lead the SEC. Jonathan Gould Tapped to Head OCC President Donald Trump also recently nominated Jonathan Gould , a former executive at blockchain infrastructure firm Bitfury, to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which is the country’s bank regulator. The White House submitted Gould’s nomination to the Senate on Feb. 11, and if confirmed, he will serve a five-year term as Comptroller of the Currency. Gould is currently a partner at law firm Jones Day, and previously held key roles at the OCC during Trump’s first administration. He was also a director at BlackRock from 2014 to 2018. (Source: Congress.gov ) The OCC oversees national banks in the US, including major institutions like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, ensuring the stability of the financial system. Kristin Smith , CEO of the Blockchain Association, praised Gould’s nomination due to his experience in crypto and banking, which she believes will be very valuable assets for leading the agency. Avichal Garg , co-founder of Electric Capital, described the move as a positive step for fintech and crypto firms looking for better access to financial services. He pointed out that Gould also advocated for fair banking access for crypto companies and opposes Operation Chokepoint 2.0. Gould previously testified before Congress in 2023 by warning that regulatory actions under Biden’s administration may have discouraged banks from engaging with digital asset firms. His nomination coincides with reports that Trump officials are exploring potential changes to the US financial regulatory landscape, including folding the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) into the Treasury or merging its regulatory functions with the OCC. Another important nomination is John Hurley as the Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial crimes. Hurley has invested in Bitcoin , and is expected to take a balanced approach to crypto regulation while also focusing on compliance, stablecoin oversight, and enforcement against illicit financial activities.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-14 05:43:12

Metaplanet, a Japanese investment firm, has raised 4 billion yen ($26.1 million) to expand its Bitcoin holdings, while GameStop’s stock surged in after-hours trading amid speculation that the company is considering adding crypto to its balance sheet. While Metaplanet has confirmed its Bitcoin acquisition strategy, GameStop is still weighing its options, reflecting the broader trend of companies exploring digital assets as part of their financial strategies. Metaplanet Raises $26.1 Million to Accelerate Bitcoin Accumulation Amidst Japan’s Economic Challenges Japanese investment firm Metaplanet has successfully raised 4 billion Japanese yen ($26.1 million) to bolster its Bitcoin holdings, marking another step in its aggressive shift towards cryptocurrency. The company announced the capital infusion through a post on its X account on Feb. 12, confirming that the funds were secured via zero-interest, unsecured, and unguaranteed bonds. The raise aligns with Metaplanet’s ambitious plan to acquire 10,000 BTC by Q4 2025 and eventually expand its holdings to 21,000 BTC by the end of 2026. At current market prices, these targets would require an investment of approximately $957 million and $2 billion, respectively. With 1,762 BTC held as of Jan. 28, the company appears poised for an aggressive buying spree in the coming months. The company’s strategic shift towards Bitcoin is not without reason. In its official statement, Metaplanet cited Japan’s challenging economic environment, characterized by high debt levels, persistent yen depreciation, and prolonged real negative interest rates. The move mirrors a broader trend among corporations, sovereign wealth funds, and even state governments that see Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. The EVO Fund, an investment management firm, backed the latest bond issuance. Notably, these bonds do not require Metaplanet to pay interest, making the raise an efficient way to increase its Bitcoin treasury without incurring additional debt-related costs. In a financial adjustment, Metaplanet also reduced the amount of yen allocated for Bitcoin purchases from 111.3 billion yen ($723 million) to 107.3 billion yen ($701 million). While the decrease may seem minor, it signals a strategic recalibration as the company evaluates the optimal approach to expanding its BTC holdings. Metaplanet’s pivot has yielded impressive results. Over the past 12 months: Its stock price has surged by 5,250%, attracting heightened investor interest. Shareholders have increased by 500%, with 50,000 new investors joining its ranks. The company’s market capitalization has skyrocketed by 11,800%, cementing its reputation as Japan’s answer to MicroStrategy. The parallels to Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) are undeniable. The US-based company has become synonymous with corporate Bitcoin accumulation, and its BTC-focused strategy has rewarded shareholders handsomely. Similarly, Semler Scientific, a US medical technology company, has also seen its stock price surge following its Bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet’s success may pave the way for more Japanese corporations to adopt Bitcoin as a treasury asset, particularly as inflationary pressures and currency devaluation remain pressing concerns. Beyond corporate adoption, Bitcoin is increasingly finding its way into state and national investment strategies. At least 16 US states, including Texas, Kentucky, and Missouri, are exploring Bitcoin purchases to diversify their reserves. Meanwhile, the United States federal government is reportedly evaluating the potential creation of a digital asset reserve, which may include BTC. On the international stage, Czechoslovakia’s central bank is considering adding Bitcoin to its foreign reserves, joining a growing list of nations eyeing cryptocurrency as a strategic asset. A Global Trend Towards Bitcoin-Based Reserves Metaplanet’s latest move aligns with a broader macroeconomic shift in which companies, states, and even central banks increasingly view Bitcoin as a digital gold alternative. The cryptocurrency’s finite supply (21 million BTC) and decentralized nature make it an attractive hedge against traditional financial risks. Financial analysts suggest that Metaplanet’s bold Bitcoin strategy could serve as a case study for Japanese firms navigating a challenging economic landscape. Should its stock continue to rise, more corporations may follow suit, further cementing Bitcoin’s status as a legitimate reserve asset. As Metaplanet continues its buying spree, all eyes will be on whether its BTC-focused strategy can sustain its meteoric stock performance—or whether Japan’s regulators will weigh in on the company’s unprecedented crypto adoption. GameStop Stocks Soar Amid Speculation of Crypto Investments In related news, GameStop’s stock surged in after-hours trading on Feb. 13, climbing 18% following reports that the company is considering investments in alternative asset classes, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. The speculation was fueled by a CNBC report citing three sources familiar with the matter. However, the report also suggests that GameStop has not yet made a final decision, as one source emphasized that the company is still evaluating whether such an investment aligns with its business strategy. GameStop’s stock price shot up to $31.30 in after-hours trading following the news but later settled at $28.36, still marking a 7% gain. The dramatic increase signals strong market interest in the possibility of a major retailer like GameStop adding crypto to its balance sheet. Interestingly, a Solana-based meme coin called GameStop (GME)—which is unrelated to the company—also saw a 45% jump to $0.0027, before correcting to $0.0025, according to CoinGecko. Speculation about GameStop’s potential crypto involvement gained traction after CEO Ryan Cohen posted a picture with MicroStrategy's executive chairman Michael Saylor on Feb. 7. Given Saylor’s outspoken advocacy for Bitcoin, some investors interpreted the post as a hint that GameStop could follow in MicroStrategy’s footsteps by adding BTC to its treasury. However, two sources informed CNBC that Saylor has no direct involvement with GameStop’s rumored Bitcoin acquisition plans. Despite this, the mere association with Saylor, whose firm holds over 190,000 BTC, has driven excitement among investors. GameStop’s potential move into crypto would align with a growing trend of corporations adding Bitcoin to their treasuries as a hedge against inflation and currency depreciation. Meanwhile, at least 16 US states are exploring Bitcoin investments as part of their treasury strategies, with discussions intensifying at both state and federal levels. While GameStop has flirted with crypto in the past, regulatory uncertainty has hindered its long-term involvement in the sector. In 2022, the company launched a crypto wallet for users, but it was shut down in November 2023 due to increasing regulatory challenges. GameStop also entered the NFT space, launching an NFT marketplace, which was eventually discontinued in January 2024 over similar concerns. The company’s past initiatives suggest an openness to blockchain and digital assets, but its history of regulatory pullbacks raises questions about how far it is willing to go this time. The Legacy of the GameStop Meme Stock Phenomenon GameStop remains the most iconic example of meme stock success, having skyrocketed over 1,000% in a month during the 2021 short squeeze, when retail traders pushed back against hedge funds shorting the stock. The WallStreetBets -fueled movement demonstrated the power of retail investors in shaping market outcomes, a trend that has only grown stronger with the rise of crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi). If GameStop does indeed enter the Bitcoin market, it would symbolize another pivotal moment where traditional finance and digital assets converge. For now, GameStop has not confirmed any Bitcoin purchases, and the company is reportedly still assessing the feasibility of such a move. However, the sharp rise in its stock price suggests that investors are highly receptive to the idea of a GameStop-Bitcoin alliance. Should the company proceed, it could mark a significant shift for GameStop from a traditional retailer to a financial innovator, potentially following the path of MicroStrategy, which has seen its stock skyrocket in tandem with its Bitcoin accumulation. Whether GameStop ultimately embraces Bitcoin or not, its influence on meme stock culture, crypto speculation, and retail investor enthusiasm remains as strong as ever.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|TRADING|MARKET|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-02-14 06:00:00

Important it is to note that institutional players often engage in the Bitcoin market silently. One such silent engagement was exposed recently, when the Bank of Montreal, Canada’s third-largest bank by asset size, officially declined its massive Bitcoin investment in its Form 13F-HR to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The declaration has once again triggered serious discussions on growing institutional interest in BTC. BMO’s Big Bitcoin Bet Every institutional investment manager controlling more than $100 million in the US is required to file a Form 13F-HR to the SEC . It was this requirement that forced the Canadian banking giant to officially confess its extreme interest in Bitcoin. As per the recent Form 13F-HR filing of BMI, the bank has at least a $150 million investment in the spot Bitcoin ETF market. A spot Bitcoin ETF tracks the current market price of Bitcoin, offering investors exposure to BTC without directly holding the asset. Blackrock Leads the Way The document clearly indicates that a significant portion of the bank’s spot Bitcoin ETF investment is held in Blackrock’s iShare Bitcoin ETF – one of the topmost players in the spot Bitcoin ETF market. According to the document, the Canadian bank has no less than a $139 million investment in iShares Bitcoin ETF. Diversifying the Crypto Portfolio The document also suggests that the bank, to an extent, has succeeded in diversifying its spot Bitcoin ETF investment. At least $11 million was distributed among other prominent players, Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, as per the document. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Russian Brokerage Finam to Offer Notes Linked to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF , Exploring Bitcoin Futures Importantly, the document also reveals that the bank has even explored the possibility of the Bitcoin futures ETF market. A Bitcoin futures ETF tracks BTC futures contracts rather than the spot price. Futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a future date and price. BMO’s Form 13F-HR document shows that the bank also has a $17,000 investment in the Proshares Bitcoin ETF, which is a BTC futures ETF. Bitcoin ETFs are driving massive crypto adoption!

Spot Bitcoin ETF Market: An Overview BlackRock’s IBIT, Fidelity’s FBTC, Grayscale’s GBTC, Ark/21 Shares’s ARKB, Grayscale’s BTC, Bitwise’s BITB, VanEck’ HODL, Valkyrie’s BRRR, Invesco/Galaxy’s BTCO, Franklin Templeton’s EZBC and WisdomTree’s BTCW are the prominent spot BTC ETFs. Among these, IBIT, FBTC, GBTC, ARKB and BTC are the top five spot Bitcoin ETFs by Asset Under Management.

The news was enough to send the GameStop (NYSE: GME) stock soaring by a massive 20%. Commenting on this, Schiff said that Bitcoin is still overvalued in comparison to GME. Peter Schiff Slams GameStop’s Bitcoin Investment Plan Bitcoin critic and economist Peter Schiff has voiced skepticism over GameStop’s recent announcement regarding a possible Bitcoin acquisition. Schiff described the move as a “Hail Mary” from the company, which he claims lacks a viable business plan. In his message on the X platform, Schiff wrote : “GameStop, a company with no viable business plan, has thrown another Hail Mary by announcing that it might use its cash to buy Bitcoin”. He further argued that Bitcoin is “even more overpriced than GME,” drawing a parallel between the two as speculative assets. Several global firms have started adopting the MicroStrategy playbook of adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Over the past four years, this strategy has yielded multi-fold returns for MSTR investors. Japanese firm Metaplanet also witnessed its stock price surge more than 4,000% in less than a year of adopting the Bitcoin playbook. However, Peter Schiff has said that just adopting Bitcoin to boost the stock price is not a good sign, if the business has no underlying strength. Will Meme GME Stock Continue to Rally? Everyone knows the massive GameStop frenzy that took Wall Street by storm in January 2021, liquidating several hedge funds in this process. Back then the GME Stock price rallied from $5 to $80 in less than a month’s time. Now that the video game retailer is considering adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, we could possibly see yet another explosive rally in GME stock . Note that the company is still in the consideration phase for crypto investments abd hasn’t finalized yet. Last weekend, GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen shared a photo on social media platform X featuring Michael Saylor, co-founder and chairman of MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. However, sources familiar with the matter stated that Saylor is not currently involved in GameStop’s discussions about potential cryptocurrency investments. In 2022, GameStop made a foray into the crypto space by launching wallets to manage cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). However, the company discontinued the service in 2023, citing “regulatory uncertainty” as the reason for the closure. Next Targets for GME Since reaching a seven-month high in early January, GameStop shares have formed a falling wedge pattern, a bullish chart formation suggesting a potential upward breakout once the upper trendline is surpassed. Investors should watch the $29 level closely, as this range aligns with a horizontal resistance zone tied to multiple price points, including last July’s swing high. A breakout above $29 could pave the way for further gains, potentially driving the stock toward the $32 region.

The agency will now review filings from Bitwise, 21Shares, Canary Capital, and WisdomTree. Brad Garlinghouse stated that the spot XRP ETF approval was “inevitable.” The XRP token is in the spotlight as the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) acknowledged Grayscale’s application to convert its XRP Trust into a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF). Now, while this isn’t a done deal just yet, it’s definitely a noteworthy step forward. It hints at a more open approach from the agency toward crypto ETFs, as pointed out by FOX Business journalist Eleanor Terrett. According to a post on X (formerly Twitter), Terrett reminded everyone that previous attempts to launch similar products, like Solana (SOL) ETFs, ran into regulatory resistance under Gary Gensler’s SEC, ultimately leading to their withdrawal last December.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Dogecoin’s future remains uncertain, investors are eyeing Lightchain AI, which has raised $15.3m in its presale with AI-driven blockchain solutions. Table of Contents Dogecoin’s current market position and its challenges Why Lightchain AI is gaining investor interest Dogecoin vs. Lightchain AI Dogecoin (DOGE) remains one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies, thanks to its strong community and historical price surges. However, recent market trends have left investors questioning whether now is the right time to buy or if newer projects with stronger fundamentals offer better opportunities. One such project making waves is Lightchain AI (LCAI), which is currently seeing strong transaction activity in its presale. Priced at $0.006, Lightchain AI has already raised $15.3 million, signaling significant early investor demand. Dogecoin’s current market position and its challenges Dogecoin has gone through many price changes, often caused by excitement and support instead of lasting use. Even though it is used as a way to pay by some shops, its wide use is still small when looked at other digital coins that aim for growth and real-life uses. One more test for Dogecoin is its growing amount. In contrast to Bitcoin, which has a set limit, Dogecoin keeps making new coins and putting them out there. This makes it hard for DOGE to keep rising in value over time unless there is a steady need. Also, competition in the meme coin world has got a lot bigger. Newer projects are using better tech and utility, making it tough for Dogecoin to stand out in͏ a changing market. You might also like: How Lightchain AI could enhance Solana’s scalability and efficiency Why Lightchain AI is gaining investor interest While Dogecoin faces uncertainty, Lightchain AI is attracting investors with its strong vision and expanding ecosystem. The project is focused on transforming blockchain with AI-driven innovations, offering a unique blend of efficiency, transparency, and scalability. One of the standout features of Lightchain AI is its commitment to decentralized governance. The platform ensures that decisions are made collectively by its community, rather than being controlled by a small group of developers or large stakeholders. This approach promotes fairness, transparency, and long-term sustainability. Lightchain AI is also tapping into a growing trend with its Memecoin Launchpad, which allows creators to develop and monetize AI-enhanced meme tokens. This opens new opportunities for users looking to innovate within the rapidly evolving crypto space. Dogecoin vs. Lightchain AI Dogecoin may still hold potential for short-term price spikes, but its long-term outlook remains uncertain due to its inflationary model and lack of fundamental utility. While it has a strong community backing, the absence of continuous development and real-world adoption limits its growth prospects. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI is showing strong momentum with its presale success. The project’s roadmap includes major developments such as governance integration, industry partnerships, and ecosystem expansion. With blockchain and AI becoming increasingly interconnected, Lightchain AI is well-positioned to capture market demand. For investors looking beyond meme coin speculation and toward future-proof blockchain solutions, Lightchain AI presents a compelling alternative. As its presale continues to gain traction, early adopters could be positioning themselves for significant gains as the project evolves.

Presented by Representatives Bryan Posthumus and Ron Robinson on Feb. 13, House Bill 4087 proposes allowing the state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of both the state’s general fund and the economic stabilization fund for cryptocurrency investments. According to the bill, the state treasurer would be responsible for directly holding and managing any crypto investments using a “secure custody solution,” a “qualified custodian,” or an “exchange-traded product” from a regulated investment company. The bill also opens the door for crypto lending, stating that if it can be done “without increasing the financial risk to this state,” the treasurer may loan the cryptocurrency to generate additional returns. Additionally, the bill mandates that any taxes or fees paid to the state in cryptocurrency must be transferred to the general fund. If a payment or fee was originally intended for another fund, the treasurer is required to reimburse that fund in fiat currency equivalent to the crypto received. With this, Michigan joins 19 other U.S. states that are currently considering a cryptocurrency strategic reserve and are at various stages of legislation.

Meanwhile, Michigan’s bill follows a similar proposal presented in the Texas Senate by Senator Charles Schwertner on Feb. 12. Commenting on the Texas bill, Posthumus stressed that Michigan should “join Texas in leading on crypto policy” by signing the “Michigan Crypto Strategic Reserve.” Michigan has previously explored crypto investments via Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded funds. In November, the State of Michigan Retirement System became one of the top five holders of Grayscale’s spot Ethereum ETF via a $10 million investment.

Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase saw its shares jump 8.44% to $298.11 on Thursday, Feb. 13, after reporting its strongest quarterly revenue in three years. According to its Q4 2024 earnings report , Coinbase generated $2.3 billion in revenue, a 138% increase from 2023, beating the $1.88 billion estimate from LSEG analysts. Net income hit $1.3 billion, while earnings per share came in at $4.68, surpassing both the $2.11 forecast by FactSet and the $1.81 expected by LSEG. The exchange says its growth was due to rising trading activity and a shift in the regulatory landscape. “Zooming out, the last few months have demonstrated a sea change in the regulatory environment, unlocking new opportunities for Coinbase and the crypto industry.” Coinbase Transaction revenue hit $1.6 billion, up 172% from the previous quarter, while subscription and services revenue grew to $641 million.

It increased by 64% compared to the third quarter and by 486% year-over-year, reaching an impressive $8.6 billion. Solana is now second only to Ethereum, having surpassed Tron in November 2024. The TVL represents the total value of digital assets staked or locked within a blockchain’s smart contracts. Raydium led the charge on Solana. The blockchain’s biggest decentralized exchange (DEX) gained 86% in TVL quarter-over-quarter, closing the year with a market share of 24%. According to Messari, the DEX’s dominance is owed to memecoin and AI-related crypto trading. In spite of a slowdown in retail trading and a cooling crypto market, Solana keeps generating more revenue than Ethereum, DefiLlama reports. The gap is even more pronounced in terms of apps. Solana app revenues exceed Ethereum apps tenfold as of February 2025. This data is current even after considering the plethora of Layer-2 blockchains on Ethereum, which host a vast share of trading activity. Solana’s revenue exceeded $8.4 million on February 9, compared to $875,571 for Ethereum. Still, Ethereum has the lead in terms of TVL: just under $57 billion compared to Solana’s $9.5 billion. With Bitcoin migrating to Solana through platforms like Zeus Network, Solana is expected to surpass Ethereum in this category. Solana is winning over institutional and retail users Solana’s speed and scalability appeal to institutions like Franklin Templeton, BlackRock, and Société Générale. The blockchain is built to handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS), supporting highly data-intensive operations. It is uniquely suitable for institutional adoption thanks to its reliable security and low transaction costs, providing the infrastructure financial institutions need to tokenize assets, integrate DeFi into workflow, or process real-time payments. Solana is used by Securitize, one of BlackRock’s leading partners. The collaboration aims to streamline and simplify tokenization, alleviating investors’ access to diverse financial products. According to Solscan, the number of active Solana wallets grew fourfold from May last year to February 2025, specifically from around 1 million to over 4 million, with spikes to 8 million on occasion. Transactions increased from 200 to 400 million, and real TPS achieved a record 4,000 last year. The shift of Bitcoin liquidity marks a turning point in Solana’s growth Zeus Network , Solana’s and Bitcoin’s flagship permissionless communication layer, offers an innovative way to tap into Bitcoin community value. Specifically, its dApp APOLLO has introduced Bitcoin liquidity to Solana. The dApp’s final testnet launched successfully on August 8, engaging over 30,000 unique addresses. Following upgrades to the Zeus Program Library, it is possible to integrate Bitcoin assets on Solana. There are currently 11 cross-chain interactions worth $16,441 in progress. Zeus Network has confirmed a total of 581 interactions so far, valued at $23.75 million. The simplicity of onboarding to Zeus is a major winning point. Users only connect their Solana and Bitcoin wallets and bind the two addresses to bring Bitcoin liquidity over. To connect a Bitcoin wallet to APOLLO, users must install one that the dApp supports, such as UniSat or Xverse. Then, they click “Connect” on the APOLLO platform, which also supports Phantom, Solflare, and other Solana wallets. The process of linking the Solana wallet is the same. Finally, they approve the signature request to bind the Solana to the Bitcoin wallet. Advantages of Solana’s PoH over Ethereum’s PoS Solana’s use of the Proof of History (PoH) protocol has been its primary improvement over the Ethereum network. Via PoH consensus, Solana achieves the throughput of 65,000 TPS (despite some other blockchains’ higher time to finality) without side chains or second layers. The mechanism creates a record that proves an event occurred at a specific time. Solana’s validators do not agree on a time, but encode it with a cryptographic hash function instead, the SHA-256. This eliminates the need to wait for confirmation. Firedancer: an important milestone In 2025, Solana will expand to Firedancer, its fourth validator. This is a colossal network upgrade developed by Jump Trading. The new validator is expected to significantly improve upon the blockchain’s transaction processing capacity. Firedancer will allow it to process over a million transactions per second as well as enhance security. Solana processes one block every 2.34 seconds, compared to Ethereum’s 13 seconds and processing capability of 15-45 TPS. Lower fees and well-optimized smart contracts Ethereum’s transaction fees are over $1. While L2 scaling solutions and the move to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) have helped reduce them, they remain a barrier for developers and users. In contrast, Solana’s architecture enables transaction costs of around $0.02 (0.0001 SOL), making it more attractive, particularly for frequent transactions. One final area in which Solana excels involves programming languages and smart contracts. Ethereum uses Solidity as the main language for writing smart contracts. It was built specifically for the Ethereum Virtual Machine and is influenced by JavaScript, Python, and C++, so any developer with experience in these languages can learn it with relative ease. Sealevel, Solana’s smart contract platform, increases throughput via parallel processing capabilities.

Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett shared the news of the regulator’s acknowledgment of Grayscale’s filing on X. This acknowledgment and potential approval could mark a turning point in the regulatory treatment of XRP, opening the door for greater institutional involvement in the cryptocurrency market. NEW: The @SECGov has acknowledged the $XRP 19b-4 filings. — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) February 13, 2025 Regulatory Shift Under New Leadership For years, the SEC took a cautious stance on cryptocurrency-based financial products. Under former Chair Gary Gensler, the agency maintained that many digital assets, including XRP, should be classified as securities. This position led to strict regulatory scrutiny and prolonged legal disputes within the crypto industry. Before stepping down, Gensler’s SEC had maintained that it would not approve new crypto ETFs until the new administration took over in 2025. However, with Donald Trump now in office and his administration’s more favorable stance toward digital assets, the SEC appears to be reconsidering its approach. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Impact of an XRP ETF Approval An approved XRP ETF would provide institutional investors with a regulated vehicle to gain exposure to the digital asset. Although Ethereum had a muted response after its ETFs were approved, Bitcoin ETFs contributed significantly to its rise to a new all-time high in March 2024. XRP ETF approval could lead to increased liquidity, higher trading volumes, and greater mainstream adoption. Institutional participation has been a key factor in legitimizing cryptocurrencies as an asset class, and ETF approval could encourage further expansion of crypto-related financial products. With multiple financial firms having applied for XRP ETFs over the past few months, approval of Grayscale’s application could set a precedent for approvals of further listings. What Does This Mean for the Ripple Lawsuit? XRP has been in the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC for years. While the uncertainty has impacted the token’s adoption in the U.S., if the SEC approves the ETF, it could be seen as an implicit acknowledgment that XRP can be treated similarly to other crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which now have approved spot ETFs. Terrett explained in another post that while the SEC’s acknowledgment is not an approval, it shows a shift in the regulator’s stance toward digital assets. She noted that the SEC is now more open-minded, and sees this as a good first step. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Investors are already intrigued by the project’s unique features, especially its one-click cross-chain transactions and a successful presale that has raised over $2.1 million in funding. But the most exciting prediction comes from a Solana whale, who believes that 1Fuel could see a 50x price surge post-launch. Could 1Fuel really deliver this? Let’s find out. XRP: A slower pace but steady fundamentals As of 13th February 2025, XRP has been trading at around $2.42. Ripple has faced resistance at $2.5 multiple times, possibly due to liquidations and decreased trading volume. Just last month, the price of XRP peaked at $3.3; however, it has since gone down by nearly 10% due to the bearish market conditions. Ripple has been a strong contender among the crypto platforms, yet its price has suffered due to the ongoing regulatory and legal issues with the SEC. Another reason behind the price fluctuations could be the drop in open interest, and without any positive news, traders are hesitant about XRP’s future. With price movement slowing, the investor focus is shifting to emerging projects, with 1Fuel (OFT) at the forefront of attention. Solana (SOL): whale confidence and bullish predictions Solana’s recent performance has sparked massive interest, especially with large whale movements. With a current value of $191, Solana maintains a solid standing within the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Analysts are optimistic about its prospects, with predictions suggesting a potential rise to $520 by 2025. This could be attributed to the increasing demand for smart contract platforms and a growing global money supply. Whales have also shown renewed interest, with some big players reactivating dormant wallets to acquire SOL tokens. This could be a positive indicator of confidence in Solana’s continued growth. However, Solana Whale thinks 1Fuel could surge 50x in price due to its innovative features and promising platform. The rise of 1Fuel (OFT): A new era in DeFi? Amidst the ongoing volatility of Solana and XRP, 1Fuel (OFT) is quickly making waves in the crypto space. The presale of the project garnered a remarkable $2.1 million, and analysts are forecasting a 50x increase after launch. 1Fuel aims to address major issues in the cryptocurrency space, especially by providing one-click cross-chain transactions that streamline the asset-swapping process across various networks. This capability may accelerate transactions and reduce expenses by cutting the need for third-party services. Along with efficiency, security is a primary concern for 1Fuel. The platform intends to utilize cold storage for safeguarding users’ assets offline, which could shield them from internet hack risks. Moreover, 1Fuel features an integrated privacy mixer and disposable wallets that guarantee complete anonymity for users. The OFT token presents an attractive chance for passive income, with staking returns soaring up to 30% APR. This feature further makes it an appealing choice for investors looking for passive income opportunities. Final thoughts As XRP and Solana maintain their dominance, 1Fuel is rising as the next big thing in the cryptocurrency market. 1Fuel, with its unique features and impressive presale results, is establishing itself as a possible disruptor in the digital wallet and cross-chain transaction market. The forecast of a 50x increase by the Solana whale reflects its growing widespread adoption and its potential recognition by leading market players.

While Cardano (ADA) is eyeing a breakthrough, Shiba Inu (SHIB) is set to surge dramatically. At the same time, investors are becoming increasingly interested in 1Fuel . The innovative project has performed remarkably well, raising over $2.1 million in its presale. As the project continues to gain traction, experts speculate it will surge by 100x, delivering massive gains to early investors. Cardano (ADA) surges amidst ETF filing Cardano has struggled to start a bullish rally since the beginning of Trump’s trade wars. However, on February 13, Cardano’s price is hovering around the $0.79 mark, surging by over 10% over the past week. Experts speculate this uptick in Cardano’s price to the recent news regarding Grayscale filing for a spot ADA ETF . This news fueled optimism in the bearish market, resulting in an upsurge in Cardano’s price. Analysts predict a continued bullish movement for the ADA token. Experts like Ali Martinez believe that with BNB surging, the ADA token would be the next one to embark on a bullish rally. However, to exhibit a bullish reversal, Cardano needs to break out of its $0.85 area. While Cardano is nearing a breakthrough, investors are intrigued by 1Fuel’s enticing features. Shiba Inu (SHIB) exhibits potential for bullish movement Shiba Inu has been struggling to maintain an upsurge lately. SHIB’s price has undergone substantial fluctuation in the past few days. However, Shiba Inu’s current price is hovering around the $0.00001623 mark, appreciating by around 6% over the past week. Experts attribute this price appreciation to the recent launch of SHIB’s NFT marketplace which is boosting investor’s confidence. Following this positive news, experts have made a bullish price prediction for Shiba Inu. Analysts like CryptoELITES have predicted that SHIB will remain bullish despite the price fluctuations and bearish trends in the past month. According to another crypto analyst, Javon Marks , SHIB is poised to appreciate by over 399% and attain the $0.000081 target. However, currently, Shiba Inu’s technical indicators, like Momentum 10 and EMA 10 , indicate continued fluctuations and downtrend. Therefore, investors are turning towards 1Fuel , the revolutionary project set to deliver 100x returns. 1Fuel steals the limelight by promising 100x profits While Cardano and Shiba Inu are edging closer to a bullish movement, 1Fuel (OFT) is positioned for a 100x price rally. The upcoming crypto wallet is set to revolutionize how users interact with digital assets. 1Fuel is a cutting-edge solution for dealing with cryptocurrencies. The innovative solution doesn’t require users to possess multiple cryptos to conduct transactions on various networks. Whether they need to trade ETH, BNB, or trade across chains, 1Fuel is the only wallet that users require. 1Fuel believes in democratizing access to institutional trading. Therefore, they are introducing an integrated P2P exchange. This would enable users to trade seamlessly with one another, eliminating the need for an intermediary. Lastly, 1Fuel prioritizes user security, so it offers advanced cold storage solutions. These solutions safeguard user assets from both digital and physical threats while maintaining ease of access.

The recent launch of TRUMP and MELANIA tokens is a perfect example of how celebrity-backed cryptocurrencies can leverage branding, public interest and market sentiment to capture investor attention. Let’s explore the marketing strategies behind these tokens and their prospects if any left. Strategies behind $TRUMP and $MELANIA Leveraging Celebrity Influence One of the most powerful tools in the marketing arsenal of TRUMP and MELANIA tokens is their association with high-profile figures. Donald Trump, as a U.S. president and a global media personality, brings a built-in audience that transcends the typical crypto community. By aligning the tokens with his brand, the creators tapped into a massive base of supporters who are eager to engage with anything linked to Trump. The fact that these tokens are affiliated with a sitting U.S. president adds legitimacy and potential longevity to their market presence. Social media domination TRUMP and MELANIA tokens have effectively utilized platforms such as Twitter (X), Telegram and TikTok to create viral content. Memes, endorsements from influencers and coordinated social media campaigns have driven significant awareness. The hashtag #TRUMPtoken has been trending across multiple platforms, further fueling FOMO among retail investors. Scarcity and exclusivity A key marketing tactic has been the creation of a sense of exclusivity. With limited token supply and strategically timed releases (days before the inauguration), investors are incentivized to act quickly, fearing they might miss out on potential gains. This scarcity-driven approach has been successful in attracting early adopters and speculative traders. The fast listings on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase served as another marketing hook, compelling many users to buy in when the price had already reached its peak. Technical Challenges and FOMO The imperfect blockchain infrastructure of Solana, on which these tokens were launched, inadvertently contributed to the hype. Users faced transaction failures and network congestion when trying to purchase early, creating even greater excitement and urgency to get in before prices soared. The new trend: celebrity meme coins The success of TRUMP and MELANIA tokens has set the stage for a broader trend in celebrity-backed meme coins. At first, there were speculations around potential launches such as $IVANKA, $ERIC and $BARRON but now we see other developments in this direction. Different public figures, like “Hide the Pain Harold” with his $PAIN token (which collected $48 million on public presale), are already jumping into the crypto space, leveraging their brand recognition to fuel token adoption and speculation. Future Prospects for TRUMP and MELANIA Tokens Despite their initial success, the long-term viability of TRUMP and MELANIA tokens will depend on several factors: Market Sentiment: As with all meme coins, hype-driven gains can be short-lived without continuous marketing efforts. Integration and Utility: If these tokens can find real-world use cases beyond speculation, they may establish stronger footholds in the market. Centralization Risks: Currently, 94% of TRUMP and MELANIA tokens are held by just 40 wallets, posing a significant risk of price manipulation and potential market crashes. Regulatory Developments: Trump’s executive order to create a U.S. cryptocurrency reserve and a more favorable stance toward digital assets could provide a positive outlook for these tokens. Impact on major cryptocurrencies If assets like BTC, ETH and SOL are included in the U.S. crypto reserve, their prices could see substantial appreciation due to increased institutional demand and global recognition. Bitcoin, in particular, could benefit from its status as a “digital gold,” while Ethereum and Solana could experience renewed interest for their smart contract capabilities and ecosystem growth. Conclusion The TRUMP and MELANIA meme coins have exemplified how strategic marketing can drive demand and engagement in the crypto space. As the market for celebrity-backed tokens continues to grow, investors should remain cautious and evaluate the fundamentals behind the hype. One thing is clear: marketing is a critical factor in the success of meme coins and those who master it can captivate the market effectively.",Information,EN,0,0,MARKET|BUSINESS|TRADING|FIAT|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-14 07:09:02

Launched in 2014, BitMEX has traded trillions in Bitcoin and other digital assets. Hayes, a former Deutsche Bank and Citigroup derivatives trader, became interested in Bitcoin in 2013 after reading Satoshi Nakamoto's white papers.

TRUMP meme coin is on a strong rally, surging 13% in the past 24 hours to $16.87. It recently outperformed top meme coins like SHIB, DOGE, and PEPE, which saw smaller gains. Its trading volume skyrocketed by 102% to over $1.5 billion, signaling growing investor confidence and strong market interest. With crypto market sentiment improving, Hayes believes meme coins will play a bigger role not just in trading but also in U.S. politics. Arthur Hayes’ Big Prediction Arthur Hayes has always been known for his bold market calls, and this time, he’s placing his bets on meme coins—specifically TRUMP. In his latest blog post , he said that meme coins could become a major part of U.S. politics, acting as a unique way for politicians to engage with their supporters. He even hinted that U.S. President Donald Trump himself keeps an eye on the TRUMP meme coin’s price. Hayes also noted that if the crypto market sentiment improves, TRUMP could surge before Bitcoin. He explained that political insiders with knowledge of upcoming pro-crypto policies might start buying TRUMP first, leading to a price rally ahead of any major Bitcoin move. Why TRUMP Meme Coin Could Keep Rising TRUMP was launched during Trump’s inauguration , and it quickly became a sensation. Today, it’s the fourth-largest meme coin after Dogecoin (DOGE), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Pepe Coin (PEPE). Its growing influence isn’t just limited to crypto enthusiasts—it’s now being discussed in political circles as well. Hayes’ prediction aligns with the growing trend of meme coins being used for more than just speculation. He believes the 2026 U.S. mid-term elections could see multiple politicians launching their meme coins to engage voters and fund campaigns. He even speculated that Chinese leader Xi Jinping might eventually create his meme coin to boost his popularity. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance Tokens Explode-Pancakeswap (CAKE) & BinanceCoin (BNB) Surge Heavily, Is FLOKI the Next One to Rise? , Analysts See More Upside for TRUMP Crypto analyst Crypto Bull is also optimistic about TRUMP’s future. He recently stated that buying TRUMP below $16 is a great opportunity, predicting that its price could double from here. This bullish sentiment adds to the excitement around the token, especially as political and market dynamics continue to evolve. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is still struggling to break past $100K, with Hayes previously warning that it could drop to $70,000 due to tightening liquidity conditions. As the market watches Bitcoin’s next move, the TRUMP meme coin is stealing the spotlight with its unexpected surge. With strong investor interest and growing political connections, TRUMP’s rally may just be getting started. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As the crypto market gains momentum, investors are watching Solana, Polkadot, and BitLemons for potential breakout gains. Table of Contents Is BitLemons about to transform the $450b gaming industry? Can Solana maintain its momentum above $190? Will Polkadot break its historical resistance? Why BLEM could be a promising investment decision As the crypto market shows signs of unprecedented momentum, savvy investors are positioning themselves for what could be the most explosive bull run yet. Expert analysis has identified three standout projects that are primed for astronomical gains: Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and the newcomer BitLemons (BLEM). While established players continue to break resistance levels, BLEM’s unique GambleFi protocol is disrupting the $450b traditional casino market with phenomenal potential for early investors. Is BitLemons about to transform the $450b gaming industry? The crypto gaming sector is witnessing a seismic shift with BitLemons’ GambleFi protocol. Having already secured $1 million in private seed funding, BLEM is positioned to capture a significant share of the $450b traditional casino market. Unlike conventional platforms, BitLemons operates with full transparency and offers unprecedented rewards to token holders. The platform’s tokenomics are engineered for sustained growth, with 30% of Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) allocated strategically, 15% for token buyback and burn mechanisms, and 15% for staking rewards. This deflationary model, combined with the current seed price of $0.01, presents an exceptional entry point for early investors. Can Solana maintain its momentum above $190? Solana has demonstrated remarkable resilience, maintaining strong support above $190 despite recent market volatility. The 7-day chart shows an impressive trading volume of $4.28b, with a 17.04% surge in 24-hour activity. Technical indicators suggest a potential breakout above $200, with the $197.57 price point becoming a crucial support level. Will Polkadot break its historical resistance? Polkadot’s recent performance has been nothing short of spectacular, with a 9.30% gain over the past week pushing the price to $5.19. The surge in trading volume to $410.07m and an 8.11% increase in market cap to $8.04b signals growing institutional interest. The chart patterns suggest a potential breakthrough of the $5.30 resistance level. Why BLEM could be a promising investment decision As traditional cryptocurrencies continue their upward trajectory, BitLemons presents an unparalleled opportunity at the intersection of gaming and blockchain technology. With its innovative GambleFi protocol already generating revenue and a tokenomics structure designed for sustained growth, BLEM at $0.01 could be the entry point investors will talk about for years to come. The combination of proven revenue models, deflationary mechanics, and high-yield staking rewards positions BLEM as potentially one of the most lucrative investments of 2025.

Dogecoin is flexing with a jaw-dropping $38 billion market cap, and Pudgy Penguins has waddled its way to a cool $659 million. But while these crypto titans bask in the limelight, there’s one presale stealing the show in the presale sector—BTFD Coin.

We’ve highlighted three top AI cryptocurrency contenders for 2025, each with strong market potential as the AI crypto coin narrative picks up even more steam. Dive in to find out which could be top AI investments this year. Best AI crypto coins for 2025: iDEGEN: The AI meme lord going rogue Goatseus Maximus: The cult AI crypto Turbo: The $69 meme defying expectations iDEGEN: The AI meme lord going rogue Everyone fears a rogue AI that menaces humanity, and iDEGEN might just be accelerating that outcome. Born without knowledge and raised by the most volatile minds on the internet—crypto degens—iDEGEN learns directly from every tag, troll, and hot take the community throws at it. It spews its thoughts every 60 minutes, mirroring the degen energy of its audience. Since its launch, iDEGEN has done everything from posting outrageous memes and conspiracies to getting temporarily banned (yes, really), which has only made it more popular. Its presale, which recently shifted to a stage-based model for easier tracking, has already seen investors rack up gains as high as 75,000%, with $21.6m driven in ahead of what’s set to be an explosive listing on the 27th of February. Two new updates have recently supercharged iDEGEN. The V2 AI has cranked things up a notch. Now it’s out there beefing with other accounts autonomously, chatting with its community on Telegram, and hijacking trending hashtags—an announcement that drove $1 million into the presale in 24 hours. With V3 just released, iDEGEN can now autonomously produce video content, positioning it to dominate new platforms like RedNote, where it’s the first AI agent on the platform. Speaking of China, iDEGEN is also the first AI agent using DeepSeek, an advantage that could put it well ahead of other AI agents. But iDEGEN’s potential isn’t about its tech; it’s about the possibilities. Will it become a meme god? A digital dictator? A glorified sh*tposter with a cult following? No one knows. Either way, it’s provocative, and the hype is growing. Set to become a top AI cryptocurrency this year post-listing, iDEGEN is one to watch. Visit the iDEGEN website to learn more. Goatseus Maximus: The cult AI crypto Launched on Solana in October 2024, Goatseus Maximus was created by an AI called Truth Terminal. Based on the meme religion “Goatse Gospel, ” it was one of the first AI crypto meme coins to hit the scene, and it took the internet by storm. Within weeks, GOAT’s market cap shot past $700 million, fuelled entirely by AI-driven meme warfare. By mid-November, it hit a $1.2 billion market cap after rising from $0.0599 to an all-time high of $1.21. Even billionaire Marc Andreessen couldn’t resist; he dropped $50,000 in Bitcoin straight into the AI’s wallet out of sheer curiosity. Goatseus Maximus doesn’t rely on staking rewards or complex roadmaps. Its growth comes from pure hype and cultural momentum. It’s an authentic meme coin with an AI edge, and its first-mover advantage could see GOAT reclaim ATHs from today’s $0.12 in 2025. Turbo: The $69 meme defying expectations Created in April 2023 by Australian digital artist Rhett Mankind, Turbo was born with a budget of just $69 and some advice from GPT-4. That’s it: no venture capital involved, just an artist, an idea, and a toad mascot named Quantum Leap. Fast-forward, and Turbo is now listed on over 110 exchanges, including heavyweights like Coinbase. It runs on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token with a fixed supply of 69 billion tokens, which is on-brand for a project that doesn’t take itself too seriously. Turbo is as decentralized as it gets, with the community driving everything—from partnerships with projects like Open Campus and Mocaverse to organizing art contests and viral campaigns. This approach has proven robust, with TURBO debuting at around $0.00031 in mid-2023 and reaching a peak of $0.0134 in December 2024, smashing a valuation of over $900 million. Turbo will go down in history as a pioneer in AI meme coins. While not as intriguing as iDEGEN or GOAT, its current price of $0.004 looks like a steal as AI crypto coins dominate 2025. Best AI cryptocurrency for 2025? Check out these three In a world racing towards AI dominance, crypto looks set to be a prime benefactor. These three projects are well-positioned to take advantage of the tens of billions set to flow into AI crypto coins in 2025, potentially spelling serious profits for today’s investors.

The 200-week simple moving average (SMA) of bitcoin's price, which smooths out short-term market fluctuations to provide a clearer picture of the overall trend, stood at $44,200 at the time of writing, according to TradingView. Although this average is at its highest point ever, it is still significantly below the previous bull market's peak of $69,000 in November 2021. That may be an important point because past data show bull markets end with the 200-week SMA rising to the record prices established in the preceding bull run. For instance, the previous bull market ended in late 2021 with the 200-week SMA rising to $19,000, the 2017 bull market peak. Similarly, the bull market of 2017 ended in December of that year, with the 200-week SMA rising to the record price of over $1,200 set four years ago. If past trends hold true, bitcoin's current range between $90,000 and $110,000 will likely resolve bullishly, paving the way for the next upward movement. The pricing of options on Deribit supports the bullish outlook offered by the 200-week SMA. For example, according to data source Amberdata, options with expirations of three months or longer show that call options are more expensive than put options, indicating a market expectation of rising prices. Further, most open interest is concentrated in call options at strikes higher than BTC's going market price of $96,700. As of writing, call option at the $120K strike was the most popular, boasting a notional open interest of over $1.8 billion, reflecting bullish expectations. Open interest refers to the number of contracts active or open at a given time.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-14 07:19:41

The bank’s submission of Form 13F-HR to the U.S. SEC revealed that it had quietly bought $139M of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETFs and distributed the remaining $11M among three other major Bitcoin ETFs. According to the BMO’s January 13 U.S. SEC filing , the bank spent $139M on BlackRock’s iShares ETFs and distributed $11M among Bitcoin ETFs from ARK 21Shares, Grayscale, and Fidelity. The $1.4T Bank of Montreal (BMO) significantly increased its Bitcoin ETF holdings by over 1053.85% from $13M to $150M in just one quarter.

The U.S. SEC requires institutional asset managers who manage assets worth over $100 million in the U.S. to file the quarterly holdings report. BMO’s Bitcoin ETF investments include $139 million in IBIT and a combined $11 million in ARKB, FBTC, and GBTC, bringing the total investment to $150 million. According to Quentin Francois, co-founder of the community-owned weRate review platform, the Bank of Montreal 10x’d its Bitcoin ETF holdings with its latest ETF investments. Francois said the ‘institutional flood was only just beginning’ as the Canadian bank stacked Bitcoin through Ark, Fidelity, BlackRock, and Grayscale. The BMO also purchased approximately $17K of ProShares Bitcoin ETF, which is invested in future Bitcoin contracts. According to AInvest, the National Bank of Canada also made a significant move by purchasing a $2 million Bitcoin ETF. The investment signaled a growing interest in digital assets among traditional financial institutions, increasing the legitimacy of crypto as an asset class. “When a major bank moves $2M into Bitcoin ETFs, it’s not just about the cash – it’s about validation. Institutions are stepping in where retail carved the path.” ~ Crypto Town Hall , hosted by Mario Nawfal, Scott Melker, and Ran Neuner AInvest notes that Bitcoin ETFs have become a popular vehicle for institutional investors to gain exposure to the crypto market without having to own or store Bitcoin directly. ETFGI reports a record $64B in net inflows for ETFs in the Canadian industry ETFGI, an independent research and consultancy firm, reported that the Canadian ETF industry recorded over $64.03 billion in net inflows in 2024.

Ethereum Price has been a key measure for many investors. Some believe that if Ethereum Price drops, smart money will shift focus to projects with real-world value. One such project is Remittix. Remittix offers a solution to a major problem in global payments and has the potential to grow fast. Many consider it one of the best cryptos to buy. Its current DeFi coin price is low, making it attractive for early investors. Ethereum Price: A Closer Look at Its Decline Ethereum Price now sits at a level that some analysts say may fall further from $2,680. Investors watch Ethereum Price closely as they see a slow drop in value. Many factors contribute to this decline. Some experts note that market pressure and profit-taking from early investors may push Ethereum Price lower. Reports from reliable sources show that Ethereum Price has a chance to decline by 10-15% if current trends continue. This decline raises concerns among those who hold Ethereum. The Ethereum network has many strengths. It supports thousands of decentralized apps and a wide range of digital finance tools. Its technology has brought about massive changes in the financial world. Still, the current drop in Ethereum Price has made some investors think about spreading risk to other tokens. As the market adjusts, Ethereum Price may not climb quickly. In such times, investors may shift focus to projects that promise a real solution for real-life problems. Remittix: A Practical Payment Solution with Strong Potential Remittix has emerged as a token that offers a clear answer to a real-world problem. Traditional international payments are slow and cost high fees. Remittix fixes this by cutting extra steps in the payment process. It connects crypto wallets to traditional banks through a system that makes transfers fast and low cost. Remittix uses a method that lets people send funds to any bank account in their region. This means that someone in a remote area can receive money quickly and spend it on day-to-day needs. Many people around the world do not have access to a bank account. In fact, nearly 1.4 billion adults lack banking services. Remittix gives these individuals the chance to get crypto into a wallet, send it to a service like Western Union, and collect cash for daily expenses. This real-world solution shows that Remittix does more than just promise high returns. It helps bridge a gap in the financial system that affects millions. The project has already sold 460 million tokens in its ICO, a sign that early investors believe in its vision. Its current DeFi coin price of about $0.0567 makes it one of the best cryptos to buy for those who want a chance at high growth. Analysts predict that if the market stays friendly, Remittix could see returns as high as 10x , 50x , or more over time. This bold forecast is based on its ability to cut transaction times and lower costs significantly. Remittix goes beyond basic crypto-to-fiat conversion. It ties the true nature of cryptography—privacy and control over your own funds—into modern finance. With Remittix, you keep control of your assets while sending payments quickly to traditional bank accounts. This design makes it appealing to those who worry about the loss of financial control. It offers a safe way to move money internationally without giving up your identity or personal data. Investors see Remittix as a game changer in the global payment system. It solves problems that have plagued traditional banking for years. Many people spend hours waiting for money to arrive when they send funds abroad. Remittix cuts that wait time down to hours or even minutes. By reducing the need for many intermediaries, the project saves money and time. This efficiency is a real benefit that can change lives, especially for those who depend on remittances for their daily expenses. Investors talk about Remittix with great hope. They see its strong fundamentals and practical use as reasons to expect parabolic gains. Some experts have compared Remittix to the best crypto to buy for 2025. The combination of its low current price, robust security measures, and real-world application makes it a strong candidate. Remittix proves that solving everyday problems can drive high returns and steady growth.

ETF Looks More Likely By the Day While PlutoChain Gains Whale Attention,https://coinpedia.org/sponsored/plutochain-pluto-gains-whale-attention/,"The post SOL to $1400? ETF Looks More Likely By the Day While PlutoChain Gains Whale Attention appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Solana’s new ATH and consolidation above the $200 mark has analysts buzzing about its potential to break $1000 and maybe even reach $1,400. Will the potential acceptance of an ETF propel SOL to break records? Meanwhile, PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could gain attention for its innovative approach to enhancing Bitcoin’s capabilities. With a new hybrid Layer-2 solution, this project offers a block time of just 2 seconds, enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications on the Bitcoin network. This development could position PlutoChain as a key player in expanding Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Let’s check out the details. SOL ETF Rumors Heat Up – Is a $1,400 Price Target Realistic? Solana ($SOL) is currently trading at $200, reflecting a decrease of 12% in the last 7 days. Despite this pullback, recent discussions have centered on the potential approval of a Solana ETF. Analysts suggest that such an approval could propel SOL’s price to around $400 by 2025. However, reaching a $1,400 target would require unprecedented market momentum and significant investor confidence. According to 7 reputable experts from InvestingHaven, medium-term Solana price predictions range from $220 to $750, averaging $450. Long-term, SOL predictions span $200 to $3,211, averaging $1,000. Their 2025 consensus indicates steady growth in the mid-hundreds. The likelihood of a Solana ETF approval has increased, with prediction markets indicating a 75% chance of approval later this year. In summary, while the approval of a Solana ETF could significantly boost SOL’s price, reaching a $1,400 valuation appears ambitious under current market conditions. Ethereum-Like Functionality on Bitcoin? PlutoChain Could Make It Happen Bitcoin’s biggest flaw might be its lack of smart contract functionality. It dominates the crypto market, yet its ecosystem remains limited. While Ethereum and Solana thrive with DeFi, NFTs, and AI-driven applications, Bitcoin struggles to compete. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) might change it due to it being the first hybrid Layer-2 for Bitcoin that could enable smart contracts, dApps, and high-speed transactions without sacrificing security. By offering an average block time of just 2 seconds (compared to Bitcoin’s 10-minute one) and potentially slashing transaction costs, PlutoChain could address Bitcoin’s scalability challenges while leveraging its robust security. PlutoChain’s Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility could allow developers to migrate Ethereum-based applications effortlessly. This means DeFi projects would no longer need Ethereum, Solana, or Cardano to function. Instead, they could potentially build directly on Bitcoin, utilizing its unmatched security. With Bitcoin DeFi’s total value locked (TVL) at just 0.13% of its market cap, the opportunity is enormous. Additionally, PlutoChain’s testnet demonstrates its potential, processing 43,200 daily transactions. Beyond speed and scalability, PlutoChain prioritizes decentralization. Governance is in the hands of platform users, who shape protocol upgrades and future developments through a unique governance system. Security is rock-solid, with three independent audits from SolidProof, QuillAudits, and Assure DeFi ensuring trust. Bitcoin has always been a store of value. However, this project could help it become much more. Final Words Solana’s ETF rumors are heating up, fueling speculation that SOL could surge to $1,400. While we can see steady growth, such a target demands extreme market momentum. Approval optimism is rising, but delays could push a U.S. ETF launch to 2026. Meanwhile, PlutoChain wants to tackle Bitcoin’s biggest limitation – its lack of smart contracts, scalability, and slow speed. As the first hybrid Layer-2 for Bitcoin, it offers a 2-second average block time, low fees, and EVM compatibility. By potentially bridging Ethereum’s functionality with Bitcoin’s security, this project could redefine Bitcoin’s case uses and ecosystem reach. ——— Please remember that this article is purely informational and not financial advice.

According to a Reuters exclusive , Gavin Kliger, a top staffer working alongside Elon Musk in the federal efficiency initiative, met with senior IRS executives at the agency’s Washington headquarters, according to sources familiar with the visit. Kliger’s arrival comes just days after a poll on Musk’s social media platform, X, which saw over 92% support for DOGE to scrutinize the IRS. 🚨 #BREAKING : DOGE officials have just entered the IRS building in DC to begin their investigation into the agency This comes after 𝕏 users OVERWHELMINGLY voted for DOGE to dig into the IRS just days ago.

We value your input. pic.twitter.com/NWSEslc0YE — MAGA Resource (@MAGAResource) November 27, 2024 During his push to support Trump’s re-election, Musk sarcastically took a dig at the IRS, stating, “ I’m the largest individual taxpayer in history. I paid $10 billion in tax. I sort of thought maybe the IRS would send me a little trophy or something, but I didn’t get anything, not even a cookie .” Speaking to reporters in a press briefing at the White House, When asked about DOGE’s probe into the IRS, Trump called DOGE’s probe into the IRS “a good job.” “ The Internal Revenue Service will be looked at like everybody. Just about everybody is going to be looked at, ” the US President reckoned. According to an email seen by Reuters, senior IRS executives were instructed on Thursday to identify all “non-essential” contracts for termination. The directive, issued by the General Services Administration (GSA), mandates a review of consulting contracts, particularly those classified as producing reports, research, coaching, or other non-critical materials. Government shakeups IRS leadership On December 5, President Trump nominated former Missouri Representative Billy Long to serve as the new IRS commissioner, though he awaits Senate confirmation. However, pending Long’s approval, the agency’s leadership has already seen changes, with former commissioner Daniel Werfel resigning on Inauguration Day rather than face termination. Douglas O’Donnell, a longtime civil servant, is currently serving as the agency’s acting commissioner. The Republican-led effort to scale back the IRS follows the agency’s $80 billion funding boost under President Joe Biden in 2022, which was aimed at improving taxpayer services, modernizing technology, and increasing enforcement on high-income individuals and corporations. GOP lawmakers are head strong on clawing back portions of this funding, which allegedly backed over 80,000 agents to audit American citizens, opposing expanded enforcement efforts.

Musk’s influence is causing Democrats a headache Musk’s personal involvement in government operations continues to strike Democratic policymakers’ nerves. Per several reports on social media, the Tesla CEO’s allies allegedly “deleted,” or took control of 18F, a federal agency that assists with technology projects, including the IRS’s Direct File program pioneered by Senator Elizabeth Warren, which offers free online tax preparation. The claim led to widespread confusion over whether Direct File remained available, though the system is still functional for the current tax season. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) condemned DOGE’s review of the IRS, arguing that Musk’s team now has access to sensitive taxpayer data. “Musk’s henchmen are in a position to dig through a trove of data about every taxpayer in America,” Wyden said. The Democratic senator also warned that DOGE’s audit could result in delays for 2024 tax refunds. “ And if your refund is delayed, they could very well be the reason. ” Cryptopolitan Academy: How to Write a Web3 Resume That Lands Interviews - FREE Cheat Sheet",Economy|DOGE|IRS|USD,EN,0,0,DOGE|REGULATION|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|PEOPLE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-14 07:46:35

However, the recovery has not been sufficient to reverse the prevailing bearish sentiment, with the cryptocurrency still trading below the key psychological level of $100,000. Notably, according to a recent insight shared by a CryptoQuant analyst known as Crypto Dan, this latest uptick from Bitcoin might just be an early sign of stabilization. Related Reading: Bitcoin On The Brink Of A Massive Short Squeeze, Expert Warns Market Indicators Show Room for Growth In Crypto Dan’s latest analysis titled “Crypto Market – The Bull Cycle Isn’t Over Yet,” Dan discussed several indicators suggesting that the current market phase still has room for growth. Notably, he highlighted that Bitcoin’s valuation metrics remain below historical overvaluation levels, and other market conditions point to potential upside in the longer term. According to Dan, the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio, a metric that measures whether Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued relative to its historical performance, remains well below the peaks seen in prior bull cycles. This indicates that Bitcoin might still have substantial upward potential. #Bitcoin $BTC momentum has shifted, signaling a possible trend reversal! pic.twitter.com/vfxoJaIfkT — Ali (@ali_charts) February 13, 2025 Dan also noted that certain hallmark signs of a market top—such as a surge in new capital inflows typically associated with altcoin season—have yet to materialize, suggesting that the bull cycle may still be in progress. In addition, Dan pointed to recent macro-level developments, such as the approval of spot ETFs and the early stages of pro-Bitcoin policies under former President Trump’s administration. These factors, he argued, could help boost confidence in the cryptocurrency market, providing the foundation for a sustained recovery. Bitcoin Market Performance Bitcoin is currently trading for $95,999, at the time of writing following a drop of nearly 10% in the past two weeks. Although the asset has managed to see a slight uptick of 1% in the past day, it remains below the $100,000 price mark. At current market prices, BTC is roughly an 11.5% decrease away from its all-time high (ATH) above $109,000 recorded in January. Interestingly, despite the decline in BTC, its daily trading volume has seen an opposite trend. Particularly, over the past few days, this metric was able to see a noticeable surge increase from below $25 billion as of February 9 to now sitting above $37 billion, as of today.

On Feb. 13, the commission published notices for Grayscale’s Form 19b-4 filings, a procedural step before the start of a 240-day window to review and decide on the applications. The countdown begins once the filings are entered into the Federal Register, which typically happens within days after the commission acknowledges applications. If processed soon, a final decision could come by mid-October. Commenting on the development, Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett explained that while the acknowledgement doesn’t mean “automatic approval”, it still marks a notable shift in the SEC’s stance. She pointed out that the agency, under its current leadership, is “more open-minded” and willing to engage with crypto ETF proposals rather than outright dismissing them. You might also like: Grayscale files for XRP ETF with NYSE She recalled that in December, exchanges pulled Solana ETF applications after the SEC, then led by Gary Gensler, signaled it wouldn’t engage with them. In contrast, the SEC, under new leadership , appears more open to considering such filings, bolstering hopes that these crypto-based products might eventually launch. Looking ahead, Terrett anticipates the SEC will soon turn its attention to XRP ETF applications from other issuers that followed Grayscale’s lead. Four other issuers, namely Bitwise, 21Shares, Canary Capital and WisdomTree, have filed their own proposals, which are now awaiting acknowledgment. NYSE Arca filed a proposed rule change with the SEC on Jan. 30 to list and trade shares of the Grayscale XRP Trust, followed by a similar filing for the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust on Jan. 31. Bloomberg analysts James Seyffart and Eric Balchunas estimate the chances of XRP and Dogecoin ETFs getting approved at 65% and 70%, respectively.

The launch date was disclosed on February 13 during the All Core Developers Execution (ACDE) Call #205. According to Tim Beiko, Ethereum Foundation Protocol Support Lead, the Pectra upgrade will first go live on the Holesky testnet on February 24 and Sepolia on March 5. On April 8, the upgrade will be completed when Pectra is activated on Ethereum’s mainnet. The increase of Ethereum’s blobspace from three to six blobs in each block is among the most important improvements in Pectra. By doing this, Layer 2 data availability will increase, further lowering costs and congestion. The upgrade will also include execution-layer enhancements aimed at improving network performance. By accelerating the rate at which Ethereum burns, Pectra will also reinforce Ethereum’s deflationary model.

However, ETH burning was slightly decreased by the Dencun upgrade’s addition of blobspace. Pectra’s decision to double the blobspace limit is anticipated to increase burned Ethereum. According to Justin Drake, an Ethereum researcher, the burn mechanisms can help Ethereum regain its position as “ultra sound money.” My bat signal 🦇🔊 will return when ETH is ultra sound again, soon enough™. ETH supply currently grows 0.5%/year. That's 1%/year of issuance minus 0.5%/year of burn. To become ultra sound again, either issuance has to decrease or the burn has to increase. I believe both will… pic.twitter.com/5TsAowD2jA — Justin.eth Drake (@drakefjustin) February 5, 2025 As previously reported by crypto.news, Pectra upgrade might have a positive impact on ETH price. However, investors are advised to remain cautiously optimistic. The price of ETH has fluctuated since falling below the psychological $3,000 mark. With waning market enthusiasm, ETH has been trading in the $2,695 range for the past week, failing to break through the $2,800 resistance. On-chain metrics show a different trend. In January, DefiLlama data shows that Ethereum’s total value locked reached its highest level since 2022. ETH could benefit from the rising on-chain activity. Ethereum ETFs continue to attract a lot of investor interest. According to data from SoSoValue , net inflows into ETH ETFs have reached $3.14 billion as of February 13. Furthermore, after Cboe BZX filed a 19b-4 with the SEC to allow staking for the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF, Ethereum may experience a rise in demand.

In a new video, Svenson tells his 82,300 YouTube subscribers that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator, which is used to determine oversold or overbought market conditions, is signaling a move to the upside for Bitcoin on the weekly time frame. According to Svenson, the RSI indicator on the weekly timeframe is currently mirroring what has previously led to significant breakouts. “E very time we get a break of the weekly RSI downtrend line, there is a major pump that follows. We had our first one back here in December 2022 which led to a 95% rise in price. In October 2023, we broke the weekly RSI downtrend again and that led to an 80% rise. The next time we did it shortly after that in January 2024… that led to a 73% rise. And here in September of 2024, that led to a 100% rise in price. And here is Bitcoin once again coming up on the weekly RSI downtrend line. We are actually pretty close to a possible weekly RSI breakout. And as you can see without fail, this indicator, this signal is one of the best, one of the most reliable signals for a long-term breakout to the upside.” The analyst and trader says that Bitcoin could go up by up to 39% from the current level if the breakout occurs. “…from high to low of the December monthly candle, if we were to get a breakout that could lead us to $134,000. And that would perfectly align with the textbook parabolic trend diagram… …we are currently at base four going into the vertical point and that vertical push may send us up to $134,000. I mean what a move, what a pump.” Bitcoin is trading at $96,180 at time of writing.

Framework 2.0: DeepSeek and CARV ID Integration for Enhanced Decision-Making,https://chainwire.org/2025/02/12/carvs-d-a-t-a-framework-2-0-deepseek-and-carv-id-integration-for-enhanced-decision-making/,"Santa Clara, California, February 14th, 2025, Chainwire CARV , the leading AI-chain ecosystem for data sovereignty, has announced an upgrade to its groundbreaking D.A.T.A. (Data Authentication, Trust, and Attestation) Framework , marking a pivotal shift in how AI agents interact with on-chain and off-chain data. With Phase 2, CARV’s D.A.T.A. framework becomes the first AI agent framework that seamlessly integrates verifiable on-chain data, cognitive AI reasoning, and economic self-awareness with token-driven intelligence , optimizing ecosystems and monetizing actions—turning AI from passive assistants into autonomous, decision-making entities. This update introduces DeepSeek’s advanced reasoning models, CARV ID ( ERC-7231 standard), and token-driven behavioral intelligence, allowing AI agents to process verifiable data, execute financial transactions, and interact dynamically with decentralized ecosystems. “AI has long operated in silos, disconnected from economic and data ecosystems,” said Yukai Tu, CTO of CARV. “With D.A.T.A. Framework 2.0, AI agents are no longer just reactive tools; they are proactive, intelligent participants in a decentralized world—capable of reasoning, verifying, and transacting autonomously with economic self-awareness through token-driven intelligence.” The Dawn of AI-Powered Web3 Economies Traditional AI systems have relied on closed, unverifiable data sources, limiting their ability to interact meaningfully with blockchain economies. D.A.T.A Framework 2.0 changes this paradigm by equipping AI agents with: Economic Intelligence : AI agents can own wallets, create digital assets, and execute transactions based on trust metrics and tokenized incentives. Multi-Chain & Off-Chain Awareness : By leveraging CARV’s deep Web3 integrations, AI agents can now fetch, verify, and act on real-time blockchain data. Token-Driven Trust Models : Agents adjust interaction patterns based on verified holdings and ecosystem contributions, making AI-driven platforms more secure and trustworthy. Verifiable AI Reasoning : Through DeepSeek’s cognitive architecture, AI agents can now analyze data, generate self-validated conclusions, and refine strategies dynamically. Through Chain-of-Thought Processing , AI models generate detailed step-by-step reasoning before executing actions, ensuring more informed and strategic decision-making. Multi-stage verification allows agents to perform self-checks on their conclusions, enhancing accuracy and reliability in complex scenarios. Meanwhile, Reinforcement Learning enables AI to evolve dynamically based on real-time blockchain interactions, optimizing strategies and decision-making over time. This fusion of advanced cognitive processes empowers AI agents to operate with greater autonomy, intelligence, and security within decentralized ecosystems. Furthermore, with DeepSeek’s cognitive reasoning embedded into D.A.T.A. framework, AI agents can now execute trades, allocate capital, and make governance decisions with unprecedented intelligence and security. ""The integration of DeepSeek into CARV’s D.A.T.A. Framework marks a turning point in AI development,"" said Yukai Tu, CTO of CARV. ""We are shifting AI agents from passive tools to self-evolving, economically aware entities that engage autonomously with both data and digital assets. By merging reasoning, trust, and decentralized intelligence, we're setting a new standard for AI’s role in the Web3 ecosystem."" To further enhance trust and personalization, CARV has integrated CARV ID to D.A.T.A. framework. CARV ID is a cross-chain identity unification layer that enables AI agents to: Link blockchain activity to social presence (e.g., Twitter, Telegram, Discord) Monetize interactions, optimize token economies, and drive sustainable growth Access holistic, multi-chain insights for hyper-personalized AI interactions By bridging on-chain identity with Web2 reputation, AI agents can tailor their responses, build trust-based engagement models, and dynamically adjust interactions based on real-world credentials.

According to the Feb. 13 press announcement , Bloomberg just launched two composite Bitcoin and Gold investment indices. The BBIG is an equal-weighted Bitcoin and Gold index. The BBUG index also includes the U.S. Dollar for added protection. According to Bloomberg, customers can adjust and customize configuration weights of the indices. The idea behind these new indices is to balance Bitcoin’s growth potential with Gold’s stability. “As a key investment hurdle in Bitcoin is elevated volatility, we see a fundamental case for using Bitcoin and Gold, not Bitcoin versus Gold,” explained Jigna Gibb, Head of Commodities & Crypto Index Products at Bloomberg Index Services Limited. The development of these indices is timely, as both Bitcoin and Gold reached record highs in 2024, prompting more investors to view them as complementary assets in diversified portfolios. Moreover, although Bitcoin and Gold have historically had nearly zero correlation with each other, they have delivered positive long-term returns, making their composite index a potential positive diversifier for multi-asset portfolios. BBIG and BBUG aren’t the first crypto indices by Bloomberg. The company also offers Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ) indices as well as the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index (BGCI), which tracks the performance of the largest and most liquid cryptocurrencies, and Bloomberg Galaxy DeFi Index (“DEFI”), designed to measure the performance of the largest decentralized finance protocols.

However, as crypto analyst Daink pointed out , Bitcoin tends to eventually follow gold’s movements after periods when they’ve been decoupled or moved in different directions. “Each time Gold displaces away from BTC, BTC plays catch up…,” he said in his recent post on X.

So, while the correlation between Bitcoin and gold might fluctuate and often be near-zero (meaning no immediate relationship), it seems that Bitcoin aligns with gold’s movements after a time, showing a latent correlation that doesn’t appear in real-time.

Besides, the optimism surrounding the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit following Donald Trump’s inauguration has increased heavily, suggesting a major price action could soon follow. In the meantime, yet another bullish update has built more confidence in the XRP price rally, with the SEC acknowledging Grayscale’s spot ETF filing. With more possibility of an approval of spot XRP ETF in 2025, is a new ATH for XRP price loading? With the SEC acknowledging the ETF filing, the XRP price witnessed a notable rise in the buying pressure that pushed the price above $2.5. Meanwhile, this does not appear to have heavily impacted the price, as the market participants find the approval to be a bullish signal rather than just an acknowledgement of a filing. Along with XRP, DOGE ETF was also recognized and similar to XRP price, DOGE price remains stuck within the same range. The daily chart of XRP suggests the price has broken down from a rising wedge and, after testing the local bottoms, is trying to validate a U-shaped recovery. While the MACD suggests a bullish continuation, the Ichimoku cloud raises concerns over the next price action. The +Di, which was heading towards a bullish crossover with the -Di, has triggered a bearish divergence. This suggests the selling pressure still mounts over the rally and hence the probability of a pullback may not be ruled out. Besides, the volume has also plunged heavily, which could drop the pace of the ongoing recovery. Therefore, the price is expected to maintain a sluggish trend until the buying pressure does not mount and push the price beyond the pivotal resistance at $2.8. On the other hand, the whales move over $430M worth of XRP, which hints towards strategic shifts by major holders. These large transactions may not impact the price but market sentiments flow in the direction of the whale movements. Now that the sentiments have turned bullish with a higher probability of approval for XRP ETF, the closure of the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit may act as icing on the cake. Therefore, the future outlook of XRP in 2025 appears to be extremely bullish, as an approval & closer may trigger a strong rally above $4, intending to surpass $5 later this year.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|REGULATION|ALTCOIN|DOGE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-02-14 08:08:16

The crypto community recently built a massive hype around CZ’s dog, whose name and picture have been revealed by him on investors’ demand. Interestingly but not surprisingly, this triggered a wave of meme-themed cryptocurrencies. Experts claim that around 20,000 Changpeng Zhao dog-themed or Broccoli meme coins have entered the market. Let’s discuss. Changpeng Zhao’s Broccoli Meme Coins Enter Crypto Space Chang Zhao has been one of the biggest personalities in the crypto space for years. Although he left Binance and served jail time, his hype is constant among crypto enthusiasts. This is clear from the buzz around his dog-themed crypto coins, which have taken over the industry. This all began when CZ talked about his dog and contemplated whether he should share the name and picture. This corresponded to the hype around the Shiba Inu dog breed, which has been ruling the crypto market with dog-themed meme coins . Interestingly, the traders flooded the CZ’s inbox, resulting in the revelation of Broccoli, a young Belgian Malinois. How does this work? I share my dog’s name and picture, and then people create meme coins?” Zhao posted. “How do you know which one is ‘official’? Or does that even matter? Zhao explained his thoughts around naming him Broccoli, stating that he wanted the name to start with B and have some greens. He punned that it also has a blocky sound, as ‘blokiichain,’ before stating that it “Can’t get away from crypto.” Meanwhile, Changpeng Zhao got involved in the Binance controversy, commenting that the Binance listing protocol was flawed . This came around the discussion of TST, which went from a test token from video promotion to a meme coin with high demand. This showcases CZ’s hype in the crypto industry, where his dog led to thousands of Broccoli meme coins. 20K Broccoli-Themed Meme Coins Launched, But Not By CZ Moments after Changpeng’s dog revelation, approximately 20,000 tokens were launched, with the Broccoli name triggering an unprecedented wave of meme coins creations. These were launched on various blockchain networks, but mainly on BNB and Solana networks, surrounding the crypto industry from all directions. Out of these thousands of broccoli meme-themed cryptos, one dog briefly reached the $14 billion market cap before crashing significantly. However, Zhao has not launched any meme-themed cryptocurrencies and does not intend to plan so. I am just posting my dog’s picture and name. I am NOT issuing a meme coin myself. It’s up to the community to do that (or not). I will likely interact with a few of the more popular meme coins on BNB Chain (BSC). The BNB Foundation may provide rewards for the top memes on the BNB Chain, giving LP support or other rewards,” CZ claimed. Some have even benefited significantly from these trending meme coins’ frenzy. One trader earned $7M in profits from the Broccoli coin, showcasing a remarkable outcome or profit driven by market hype alone. What’s In There For You? The launch of nearly 20,000 Broccoli meme coins is a testament to the crypto market’s functioning. This clarifies how the hype drives the tokens and investors. Changpeng Zhao’s dog revelation became remarkable but disappointed many, as Zhao did not launch the token. Meanwhile, many traders benefitted from this hype, one making $7M in profits within a few hours. However, despite all this buzz, investors must analyze and research before investing due to high volatility.

Sui’s efficient transaction capabilities enable faster processing of trades, lending/borrowing, staking, and other DeFi activities.

However, despite remarkable price gains, a crypto whale, also an early buyer of the token, has recently offloaded a whopping 10 million coins to Bybit. On-chain data revealed that this trader constantly dumped massive amounts to date, raising marketwide speculations of a looming price dip for the cat-themed meme coin. POPCAT Price At Risk? Early Buyer Whale Dumps Heavily Sparking Concerns According to the data by Spotonchain on February 14, a holder of the Solana meme coin revived after 2 months of dormancy to deposit 10 million tokens worth $3.15 million to Bybit. This whale is registered to be an early buyer of the meme coin, as it bought massive amounts as early as December 2023. Source: Spotonchain, X Data revealed that the address ‘8icKq’ bought 9.27 million tokens with 350 SOL as of December 14, 2023. However, the trader has offloaded nearly all his holdings to date, leaving behind slightly over 1 million coins. Intriguingly, Spotonchain revealed that this trader made a $7.32 million profit (+633%), strategically trading amid POPCAT price action shifts. In turn, the recent decision to dump tokens sparked marketwide speculations, as it could be due to further profit booking amid a 60% weekly rally. Further, usual market sentiments flashed uncertainty as the selloff could also be due to the trader’s loss of confidence in the asset’s potential to gain more ahead. What’s Fueling The Rally? Simultaneously, it’s also worth pointing out that Coinbase’s expansion of support for the Solana meme coin substantially uplifted its market sentiment over the past few days. CoinGape reported that Popcat’s price rallied as Coinbase recently unveiled a perpetual contract launch for the asset. Meanwhile, such backings or positive updates from the top crypto exchanges usually boost market sentiment. Having said that, it appears that Coinbase’s support has projected a bullish outlook for the Solana meme coin, contributing to heightened market exposure for the asset. Is The Pump Coming To An End? At the time of reporting, POPCAT price witnessed an 8% pump and is trading at $0.3495. The coin’s 24-hour low and high were $0.2837 and $0.3511, respectively. Weekly gains for the asset totaled 63%. It appears that the Coinbase update acted as a primary catalyst for the recent surge. Notably, Coinglass data indicated that the meme coin’s futures OI soared over 7% to reach $167.88 million. It appears that the broader market sentiments for the asset are optimistic at the moment despite the selloff. However, renowned market expert ‘AltCryptoGems’ recently took to X, raising caution against the top Solana meme coin . The analyst spotlights how some of the meme coin charts have taken severe heat amid the broader market turbulence since late 2024. “We got a nice bounce from demand, but we need another 10X to reach the all-time high again,” the analyst stated, highlighting POPCAT price chart. He further concluded, “Be careful trying to force your hand with these; at least wait for a proper daily reversal!’ exercising caution over the dynamic meme-themed asset’s future outlook.

If not, you’re not alone. Many investors watched from the sidelines as WIF exploded, turning small bets into life-changing gains. But history is giving you another shot with the top new meme coin to buy for 2025. BTFD Coin (BTFD) is in its presale stage, offering a golden opportunity before it follows a similar trajectory. With a presale that has already raised over $6.05 million, the 14th stage is almost complete, making this the perfect time to jump in. Investors who act now could lock in a 3650% ROI once BTFD hits its projected moon price of $0.006. BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token. It’s combining an exciting Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming ecosystem with staking rewards and a thriving community. With analysts predicting a massive surge post-listing, BTFD could be the top meme coin investment of 2025 . BTFD Coin (BTFD) – A Presale That’s Too Big to Ignore Meme coins thrive on hype, and BTFD Coin is stacking up momentum faster than most. Its presale has already secured over 69 billion tokens sold to more than 10,600 holders. Currently priced at just $0.00016 in Stage 14, BTFD will list at $0.0006—offering a 275% return before it even hits exchanges. But that’s just the beginning. Analysts predict it could surge to $0.006, giving early investors a 3650% ROI. The Play-to-Earn (P2E) game , launching on January 1, 2025, lets users earn while enjoying an immersive gaming experience. The staking rewards are another massive draw, with an insane 90% APY available to holders. But what truly sets BTFD apart is its Bulls Squad, a dynamic community dedicated to turning dips into golden opportunities. This meme coin isn’t just about laughs—it’s a strategic play to maximize gains. Imagine investing $8,000 in BTFD at its current price of $0.00016. That would net you 50 million tokens. When BTFD reaches $0.0006, your holdings will be worth $30,000. But if it hits the predicted $0.006 moon price, your investment would soar to $300,000. This isn’t just speculation—it’s a roadmap backed by community strength and a proven market trend. The presale is moving fast, with Stage 14 almost complete. Investors who wait risk missing out on this entry price before the next increase. Once the BTFD Coin enters its final presale stage, the price will climb higher, making now the ideal time to lock in gains before the real FOMO kicks in. Dogwifhat (WIF) – The Meme Coin That Made Millionaires Dogwifhat (WIF) was one of the biggest meme coin success stories, defying expectations and turning small investments into fortunes. Early adopters who grabbed WIF before its surge saw exponential returns as it skyrocketed. But not everyone got in on time, and many were left watching from the sidelines as WIF hit massive highs. Starting as just another meme coin, WIF gained traction thanks to viral momentum and an enthusiastic community. It exploded onto the scene and became one of the most talked-about meme coins of the year. The rise of WIF showed just how quickly meme coins can go from obscurity to dominating the market. The problem? If you weren’t early, you missed out on the biggest gains. By the time most investors noticed, WIF had already soared, and buying in at the top left little room for growth. But this is exactly why BTFD Coin is catching so much attention—it’s giving investors a chance to correct that mistake. Presale Performance and Analysts’ Predictions for BTFD Coin Crypto analysts are calling BTFD Coin one of the most promising meme coin investments heading into 2025. With its presale selling out fast and community engagement at an all-time high, the momentum behind BTFD is undeniable. The structured presale ensures early investors get in at discounted prices, setting them up for major returns post-launch. BTFD started at $0.000004 per token and has steadily increased in value through each stage. Now at $0.00016, investors still have an opportunity to grab discounted tokens before the final presale stages push the price up further. Once it lists at $0.0006, those who bought early will already be sitting on a 275% return. If BTFD follows the trajectory of past meme coin giants like WIF, its $0.006 target could deliver one of the most explosive ROIs of the year. With the Play-to-Earn game launching on January 1, 2025, and staking rewards offering a 90% APY, BTFD isn’t just riding hype—it’s building a sustainable ecosystem. The Bulls Squad community further strengthens the project, ensuring continued engagement and demand. All signs point to BTFD Coin being the top new meme coin to buy for 2025 before the window of opportunity slams shut. Final Thoughts – Don’t Let This Be Another Missed Opportunity! You watched Dogwifhat (WIF) explode and regretted missing the early days. Now, you’re getting a second chance with the top new meme coin to buy for 2025, BTFD Coin before it enters its next stage. The presale is nearly sold out, and once it’s gone, the price will never be this low again. This is the moment where early adopters can lock in gains before the masses jump in. With BTFD’s current price at $0.00016 and its projected moon price of $0.006, the potential for 3650% ROI is right in front of you. Whether it’s staking at 90% APY, the P2E game, or the growing Bulls Squad, this meme coin is primed for explosive growth. Don’t be the one who looks back and says, “I should’ve bought BTFD when it was in presale.” Act now before Stage 14 closes, and secure your place in what could be the next massive meme coin surge.

With its low entry price and strong market momentum, the potential for turning $300 into $999,000 feels more achievable than ever.

Solana (SOL): Fast and scalable, but its market is maturing, making massive gains less likely. Polygon (MATIC): A strong performer in Ethereum scaling, but it lacks the exclusivity and newness of MAGACOINOFFICIAL . Kaspa (KAS): An up-and-coming blockchain project with potential but without the momentum MAGACOINOFFICIAL is generating. Don’t Miss Out on MAGACOINOFFICIAL The chance to turn $300 into $999K doesn’t come often, but MAGACOINOFFICIAL might just be that opportunity.

Conversely, the lower Bollinger band is at $604.56, securing the support level. Binance Coin descends to the $668.14 The RSI indicator is in the neutral region. Currently at 53.48 and in a downtrend.

Coin value increased to a high of $670.24 over the last 24 hours. Overall, the currency value increased by 0.97% on the day. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins to hold them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,472.04 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB’s price increased over the last 24 hours, above the support at $661. Buyers stepped in to buy the assets; moreover, the support floor at that level seems stable because bulls have mostly dominated in the past week, whereas the coin is still trading on the balanced end of its daily price range. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including Wallet Investor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another additional factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,331.19 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but stepped down to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In February 2025, BNB is trading near the psychological mark of $670, just below the January prices.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-14 09:20:00

This authorization allows Bitget to provide various crypto-related services within Bulgaria, including exchange, trading, transfer, custody, and public offering of digital assets, as well as wallet services. The move is part of Bitget’s broader strategy to expand its presence in Europe and work towards obtaining the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) license, which aims to create a standardized regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies across the European Union. Hon Ng, Chief Legal Officer at Bitget, described the Bulgarian license as a significant step in the company’s efforts to operate within the EU’s regulatory landscape. Compliance with such emerging frameworks as MiCA also bears prospects for the long-term growth and stability of the crypto market, he noted. Ng sees Bulgaria as a strategic entry point in Bitget’s European expansion, owing to the supportive regulatory framework enabling digital asset adoption. Ng mentioned, “The successful application of the VASP license in Bulgaria is a part of Bitget’s expansion strategy to serve users across the European Union.” Looking ahead, Bitget plans to expand its regulatory footprint globally by working with regulators in different jurisdictions. Ng argues that regulatory alignment enhances user trust, strengthens the integrity of the market, and encourages the use of digital assets, affirming the company’s commitment to compliance. Bitget has already received regulatory approvals in several European jurisdictions, including Poland, Italy, Lithuania, and the United Kingdom. The recently acquired license for Bulgaria attests to its commitment to conducting business in a regulated manner. With this clearance, Bitget will be allowed to offer a variety of services to the Bulgarian digital asset user base. These include crypto-to-fiat exchange services, secure transaction facilitation, and custody solutions designed to protect user assets. Additionally, the license enables the public offering of crypto assets, potentially opening up new opportunities for token launches. Bitget has been actively expanding its regulatory reach in recent months. The company has acquired a BSP license in El Salvador, approval in the United Kingdom to provide digital asset services, and has played a role in developing the Vietnam-based exchange BitEXC. In addition, Forbes recently recognized Bitget as one of the world’s most trustworthy exchanges, reflecting its efforts in compliance and security. As the company continues to grow within Europe, it plans to collaborate with regulators to ensure its services align with legal requirements, while focusing on the protection of user assets and data. This new legal milestone in Bulgaria is just one more illustration of how the bitcoin sector is driving the need for both innovation and compliance in a rapidly evolving global regulatory environment.

40313340,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=695857,1739525403,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Bitcoin Retail Volume Close To Growing Again: Bullish Sign?,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-retail-volume-close-growing-again-bullish/,"On-chain data shows the demand for using Bitcoin is now neutral from retail investors and could be heading toward a reversal to the upside. Bitcoin Retail Volume No Longer Plummeting As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake post, the demand among the retail investors may be close to growing again. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the “Retail Investor Demand,” which measures, as its name suggests, the demand for the Bitcoin network that’s present among the smallest of entities. Since these investors have such small wallets, their transactions tend to be of a small size as well. Thus, the Retail Investor Demand makes use of the collective transaction volume of the small transfers (less than $10,000 in value) to track the activity of this cohort. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could End Up Plummeting To $80,100 If This Support Fails Now, here is the chart shared by the quant that shows the trend in the 30-day percentage change of the Bitocin Retail Investor Demand over the last few years: As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day change in the Bitcoin Retail Investor Demand plunged to a significant negative level earlier in the year, meaning the volume related to small investors was down a large percentage over a 30-day period. Since this low, though, the metric has been climbing back up and its value is today at almost the 0% mark, implying its drawdown has just about finished. If the same trajectory continues, it’s possible that the indicator should break into the positive territory, which would imply growth in interest from the retail investors. From the chart, it’s visible that the last time the Retail Investor Demand saw a break into the green zone was just before last year’s rally beyond $100,000. Back then, the volume from these investors had kept rising until hitting a peak of about +30%, which had interestingly nearly coincided with last year’s price top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Unable To Break Upward As 1.6 Million BTC Resistance Wall Blocks Path It may be no surprise that the asset’s consolidation followed when growth in the volume related to this group disappeared and a decline in activity took over. Back during the 2021 bull run, the Retail Investor Demand saw a plummet into the negative territory similar to the one witnessed earlier in this year. The indicator then reversed its value in spectacular fashion as it broke past the 0% mark with a sharp surge and kept rising until a notable green level. This turnaround in retail investor coincided with the start of the second half of the 2021 rally. It now remains to be seen whether retail volume will make a similar comeback this time as well, potentially implying a reignition of bullish momentum for Bitcoin, or if it would take a while more to recover. BTC Price Bitcoin has continued its recent trend of consolidation during the past day as its price is still trading around the $96,300 level.

Speaking during Coinbase fourth-quarter 2024 earnings call on Feb. 13, Armstrong drew parallels between the current wave of crypto adoption and the early 2000s when businesses had to adapt to the internet. “Onchain is the new online,” Armstrong stated, emphasizing that companies integrating crypto today are positioning themselves for the future. If his prediction holds, over $10 trillion in value could be tokenized or running on blockchain networks by the end of the decade, based on the World Bank’s estimate of global GDP surpassing $100 trillion. Armstrong also sees the U.S. playing a leading role in this transition, crediting President Donald Trump’s policies for accelerating crypto adoption. He noted that the U.S. now has the “most pro-crypto Congress” Coinbase has ever seen, with ongoing efforts to push forward stablecoin regulations and broader market structure legislation. Coinbase Reports Strongest Quarter in Over a Year Coinbase reported a significant jump in revenue , posting $2.3 billion in earnings for Q4 2024, marking an 88% increase from the previous quarter. Armstrong stated that the company is well-positioned to be the “preferred partner” for businesses looking to integrate blockchain-based financial infrastructure. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller recently called for stablecoin regulations to allow banks to issue dollar-backed digital assets, reinforcing Armstrong’s point that regulatory clarity could drive the next phase of growth in the crypto industry. Regulatory Momentum and Global Adoption As the U.S. pushes forward with regulatory frameworks, Armstrong expects other nations to follow suit, suggesting that global crypto adoption will accelerate in response. “Given the U.S. leadership here, the rest of the world is taking notice and will be under pressure to embrace crypto adoption,” he explained. Looking ahead, Armstrong said Coinbase’s focus for 2025 would be on expanding revenue streams within existing products while fostering greater utility in new categories where crypto is gaining traction. He also emphasized the company’s role in “building the foundations to power this next decade of growth.” The post Coinbase CEO Predicts Crypto to Power 10% of Global GDP by 2030 appeared first on TheCoinrise.com .",Finance and Business News|Coinbase CEO|Crypto Adoption,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'The Coin Rise', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecoinrise.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecoinrise,2025-02-14 09:30:44

What Does the Data Indicate? Analyst Answers!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-bitcoins-bull-run-over-or-are-we-just-getting-started-what-does-the-data-indicate-analyst-answers/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has been moving between $90,000-100,000 for a while now. In the face of this situation, questions such as whether the bull market is over or will the rise continue? are increasing, while one analyst stated that the rise will continue. Bitcoin Still Bullish, Consolidation Will Result in Rise! Market analyst Omkar Godbole said that the ongoing consolidation between $90,000 and $110,000 in Bitcoin is likely to result in an uptrend. Stating that he reached this conclusion from historical data, the analyst used the 200-week simple moving average (SMA). Noting that at this point, BTC's 200-week SMA remains well below the ATH in the 2021 bull market, the analyst said that the SMA indicator shows that Bitcoin still has a lot of upside potential. Noting that BTC’s 200-week SMA is around $44,200, the analyst said that the current bull run will not end before the SMA reaches the ATH recorded in the previous bull cycle: “Although the 200-week SMA is at its highest point ever, it is still significantly below the previous bull market peak of $69,000 in November 2021. This could be an important point because historical data shows that bull markets end when the 200-week SMA rises above the record prices set in the previous bull run.” Citing previous data as an example, the analyst said, “the previous bull market ended in late 2021 with the 200-week SMA rising to the 2017 bull market peak of $19,000.” According to this example and the historical trend the analyst is basing it on, the current bull cycle will not end until Bitcoin’s 200-week SMA reaches its 2021 cycle peak of $69,000. This means that Bitcoin is still in the bull phase and still has much more upside to go. “If history repeats itself, Bitcoin’s current consolidation between $90,000 and $110,000 is likely to end in a bullish move, paving the way for the next rally, as historical trends suggest that BTC has significant upside potential.” *This is not investment advice.

With this development catching attention, another token, XYZ, is making headlines by hitting a $7 million presale milestone. Could XYZ be poised for a significant breakout as well? The unfolding events suggest potential shifts worth watching closely. XYZVerse: The Best New Meme Project You Can’t Afford to Bench! XYZ is your exclusive VIP pass to a sports-driven, meme-fueled revolution. Think of it as the MVP of the XYZVerse ecosystem, where crypto enthusiasts can score big off the growing demand for meme coins. But every revolution needs a hero—someone willing to fight against the odds and push the $XYZ token to the top. That hero is XYZepe , the masked fighter, the true believer, the relentless $XYZ holder whose mission is to bring XYZVerse to the #1 spot on CoinMarketCap. It’s about proving that underdogs can rise to greatness. With millions of sports fans ready to hit the field, the XYZVerse ecosystem is set to keep expanding—and your rewards will slam dunk through the roof! And here’s a highlight reel moment: XYZVerse has been officially recognized as the Best NEW Meme Project—a title that underscores its explosive potential in the meme coin arena. XYZ presale is your first-quarter chance to get in before the mind-blowing explosion! Meme coins are the undisputed champions of the crypto world, and XYZ is set to crush the competition. Currently priced at $0.002, $XYZ remains an undervalued crypto gem poised to rise to $0.1 at the final presale stage. But victory doesn’t happen overnight—it takes dedication, strategy, and a fighter willing to go the distance. XYZepe knows the battle ahead, but with the community behind him, he’s taking $XYZ to legendary status. With upcoming listings on major CEX and DEX platforms, rock-solid defense in the form of audited smart contracts, and a fully vetted team, XYZ is already ahead of the game. The first-mover advantage is key here—get in before the crowd storms the field, and you’ll be sitting on way bigger returns! XYZepe is fighting for glory—will you stand with him? Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Ethereum-Powered Memecoin Making Waves Shiba Inu, known as SHIB, began as a playful nod to Dogecoin but has grown into something more. Launched in August 2020 by the mysterious Ryoshi, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain. This connection means it can tap into Ethereum’s vast network of apps and services. In a bold move, half of SHIB’s enormous supply was sent to Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum. Buterin’s donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burning 40% of the total supply brought SHIB into the limelight. Unlike some memecoins, SHIB is building real-world applications. It launched ShibaSwap, its own decentralized exchange. There’s also talk of a future platform for NFTs and a system where users can help make decisions (a DAO). With the crypto market favoring projects with solid utility, SHIB’s plans might give it an edge. Other coins like Dogecoin sparked interest, but SHIB’s integration with Ethereum could make it stand out. As the crypto space evolves, SHIB shows potential to be more than a fleeting trend. Conclusion SHIB and others show promise, but XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely blends sports and meme culture, aiming for 20,000% growth and positioning itself as a cultural icon in crypto.

33767162,[object Object],1739526591,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"GameStop’s Ryan Cohen Hints at Bitcoin Investment, Could Spark Altcoin Rally",https://bitcoinist.com/gamestops-bitcoin-investment-sparks-altcoin-rally/,"On Monday, GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen posted a pic with MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor. Many saw where this was going, and they were right – insiders say GameStop plans to take a page from MicroStrategy’s book and invest in Bitcoin ($BTC). GME shares spiked over 20% on the back of the rumors, hitting $31 before falling to $26. There’s also an amusing correlation with the unofficial $GME token, which recorded a 32% daily increase. pic.twitter.com/wlOwEGli6n — Ryan Cohen (@ryancohen) February 8, 2025 This happened without Cohen himself saying a word. Imagine the giant leap GME stock would make if he does go ahead and buy $BTC. It’s likely the impact of this would extend well beyond GameStop. GameStop to Follow in MicroStrategy’s Footsteps? GameStop has become a symbol of retail investor unity. It’s the antipode of all things Wall Street that showed how small traders can come together to shake the ivory towers to their foundations. The company’s pivot into crypto aligns perfectly with this rebellion. GME fell 15.95% YTD , and Cohen is evidently looking for ways to increase its profitability. Monday’s picture with Michael Saylor suggests he could be hoping to learn from MicroStrategy’s BTC-focused approach. For context, Saylor’s MicroStrategy began investing in $BTC in 2020 and now holds over $46.5B in the asset. MSTR stock price has since surged 2,083%. Could GME experience similar growth if GameStop follows the same approach? Definitely. More than that, it could set a precedent for S&P 500 companies to take crypto seriously. GME is not yet part of the S&P 500, but it fits the criteria (market cap of at least $12.7B) and could soon join the titans. The approach makes even more sense if you consider the repeated recession headwinds of the past years. While the Fed has tried to resist the trend with massive fiscal stimulus and interest rate cuts, the economy is far from recovery. Companies like MicroStrategy and GameStop adopt $BTC as an inflation hedge. They bet on $BTC to maintain its value during market stress, particularly as more companies follow their lead. Never Miss Another GME Spike: MIND of Pepe ($MIND) Predicts Market Moves Some $GME token and GME stock holders saw a nice uptick in their portfolios today – and might see even greater gains if (when) GameStop adds $BTC to its balance sheet. However, many find out about these types of opportunities too late. So, how do you predict them? One solution is MIND of Pepe ($MIND) , an AI agent that analyzes market data and gauges sentiment on social media to deliver exclusive trading insights. With its ability to process information from numerous sources on the fly, MIND of Pepe can help its community make timely investments and secure profits. In other words, MIND of Pepe equips its token holders to be the first movers, capitalizing on the news before it goes mainstream. MIND of Pepe is also capable of creating its own tokens, which would first be available to its early supporters at below-market prices. The $MIND token presale kicked off in January and has already generated $6M in funding. One token now costs $0.0033188, but the price will increase when the project reaches the $6.7M funding milestone. After $MIND launches on exchanges, the demand should surge, pushing its price even higher. This means now is the perfect time to secure your share of tokens and stake them at 380% APY. GME Resurrection 2.0? The ripple effects of GameStop’s potential $BTC investment could extend far beyond a single stock price spike. Just as the 2021 short squeeze rewrote the rules of retail trading, GameStop’s crypto pivot could cause a shift in how companies approach treasury management. The question isn’t just whether GameStop will invest in Bitcoin, but how many might follow. MIND of Pepe could help retail investors stay ahead of market-moving developments, offering insights once reserved for institutional traders. This makes it one of the best presales of the year . However, we remind you that no gains are guaranteed in the crypto market.

Tokens like XYZ and SOL have surged dramatically, catching the attention of investors. Could these gains signal the beginning of a new phase where alternative coins outperform the market leader? The latest developments suggest a shift may be underway. $XYZ Targets 99,900% Growth, Unlocking G.O.A.T. Status XYZVerse ($XYZ) has brought a brand-new concept to the memecoin niche by blending the excitement of sports with the fast-moving energy of crypto. Designed for hardcore fans of football, basketball, MMA, and esports, this project goes beyond just being another token—it’s a growing community built around passion for the game. With the bold Greatest of All Time (G.O.A.T.) vision, XYZVerse is aiming higher than the average meme coin. And people are taking notice—it has recently earned the title of Best New Meme Project.

The $XYZ presale is already smashing through stages with the speed of a champion’s knockout blow. Join $XYZ Presale Now and See Your Pennies Grow Into Millions! Solana (SOL) Over the past six months, Solana’s price has surged by 38.74%. In the last month, it edged up by 5.56%, while the past week saw a slight dip of 1.63%. Currently, SOL is trading between $177.92 and $221.63, close to its 10-day simple moving average of $195.10 and slightly below the 100-day average of $199.36. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.31, suggesting that the coin is neither overbought nor oversold. With a stochastic value of 18.14, Solana is approaching oversold territory. The MACD level at -0.78 indicates mild bearish momentum in the short term. If the price declines, it may test the nearest support level at $155.26, which is about 12% below the current lower range. On the upside, breaking through the nearest resistance at $242.68 would mean a climb of around 10% from the current upper range. If bullish momentum continues, the second resistance level at $286.39 could be the next target, representing a potential gain of over 20%. Conversely, if bearish trends prevail, the second support level at $111.55 might come into play, marking a significant drop from current prices. Polkadot (DOT) Over the past week, Polkadot’s price has increased by 8.92%, bringing it into the range of $3.95 to $5.43. This short-term rise contrasts with a 19.84% decrease over the past month. However, looking at the last six months, the price has grown by 19.58%, indicating longer-term potential. The current Relative Strength Index is 52.14, suggesting a neutral market with a slight upward bias. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are $5.17 and $4.93 respectively, pointing to a modest bullish trend. The MACD level at 0.0400 supports this positive momentum. If the price continues to climb, it may test the nearest resistance level at $6.10, which is about 12% above the current high. A breakthrough could lead to the second resistance at $7.58, representing a potential gain of around 40%. On the downside, if the price falls, it might find support at $3.14 or even $1.66, indicating significant decreases. The stochastic value of 22.81 suggests that the coin is approaching oversold territory, which could attract buyers. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) has seen notable price movements recently. In the past week, its price rose by 6.68%, trading within a range of $0.52 to $0.83. However, over the last month, ADA decreased by 17.25%. Looking back six months, the coin impressively climbed by 136.25%, reflecting strong growth over the longer term. The 10-day simple moving average is $0.78, slightly above the 100-day average of $0.74, indicating a minor upward trend. The Relative Strength Index is 49.77, close to neutral, suggesting a balance between buying and selling pressure. The stochastic indicator at 28.83 hints that ADA may be nearing oversold territory, which could lead to a price increase. ADA faces a resistance level at $0.99. If it breaks this, it could move toward the next resistance at $1.2987, representing potential gains of over 20% and 50% respectively. The nearest support is at $0.36, and a drop to this level would mean a decline of around 30%. Based on current data, ADA might rise toward resistance levels if momentum continues. Ripple (XRP) In the past week, XRP’s price has increased by 2.46%, trading between $1.86 and $2.86. Over the last month, it experienced a slight decline of 3.27%. Despite this, XRP has seen significant growth over six months, surging by 333%. The current price is close to both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages, which are $2.46 and $2.43, respectively. This indicates a period of price stability. The Relative Strength Index is at 48.75, suggesting a balanced market without extreme buying or selling pressure. With a Stochastic value of 16.94, XRP might be considered oversold, which could signal an upcoming price increase. Looking ahead, XRP faces a resistance level at $3. Breaking through this point could lead to a rise of approximately 22% from the current price. The next resistance level is at $4, offering a potential gain of around 62%. On the downside, the nearest support level is at $1.33. If the price drops to this point, it would represent a decrease of about 46%. Given its strong performance over the past six months, XRP has the potential to test higher resistance levels in the near future.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has acknowledged Grasycale's applications for XRP and dogecoin (DOGE) spot ETFs, Fed. 13 updates by the market regulator show. These filings will now be submitted to the SEC's federal register, setting off a 240-day deadline to review and decide on the applications. Recently, there has been a wave of filings for altcoins ETFs, including Solana's SOL and Litecoin (LTC), indicating expectations for accelerated integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance under Donald Trump's Presidency. Potential approval of XRP and DOGE spot ETFs, regulated and familiar investment vehicles, would make it easier for institutions to take exposure to these coins without directly purchasing and storing them. That could enhance market liquidity and boost demand for these tokens. XRP traded higher at $2.73 at press time, up 10% on a 24-hour basis. It was the best-performing top 100 cryptocurrency by market value. Meanwhile, DOGE traded 4% higher, according to data source CoinDesk and Coingecko. ""In a notable development, the SEC has accepted ETF applications for XRP and Dogecoin, adding to a growing list of altcoin ETF reviews, including Solana and Litecoin. If approved, these products could significantly expand institutional access to altcoins, injecting liquidity and potentially setting the stage for an alt-season later this year,"" Valentin Fournier, analyst, BRN told CoinDesk in an email. Digital assets are showing slight upward momentum, supported by positive regulatory signals and easing trade tensions,"" Fournier added. Jupiter's JUP token also traded 10% higher in response to the decentralized exchange's plan to allocate 50% of its protocol fees toward repurchasing and locking JUP tokens for three years from Feb. 17. The plan aims to reduce the token's circulating supply and boosts the platform's sustainability. Bitcoin (BTC), meanwhile, continued to trade lacklustre, around $97,000 amid continued outflows from the U.S.-listed spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The 11 spot BTC ETFs listed in the U.S. have witnessed a cumulative net outflow of $650 million this week, according to Farisde Investors . Still, the dull price action offered hope against the backdrop of hotter-than-expected U.S. CPI and PPI releases this week. ""Given Bitcoin’s resilience in the face of high inflation and improving regulatory clarity, this accumulation phase may lead to a strong rally in the coming weeks. We maintain a bullish outlook and recommend continued heavy exposure to digital assets, balancing BTC and ETH based on market capitalization,"" Fournier said.",Markets|XRP|Bitcoin|Markets|Jupiter|DOGE,EN,0,0,DOGE|XRP|MARKET|BTC|JUP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-02-14 09:52:15

Bitcoin (BTC) has fluctuated between $95K and $100K in the last week, with analysts split on whether it will break past $100K or face a correction below $92K. The meme coin sector nears $80B market cap, with POPCAT, WIF, and SPX6900 being among the top performers today (February 14), while AI16Z, FARTCOIN, and AIC see some declines. Pi Network in the Spotlight The controversial crypto project, which claims to allow people to mine digital assets directly from their smartphones, announced that it will officially launch its Open Network on February 20. The major milestone (if it indeed goes live) will come nearly six years after Pi Network’s birth. The team previously assured that the introduction of the Open Network would occur once 15 million users passed necessary Know-Your-Customer (KYC) verifications. According to the team, 19 million Pioneers have successfully completed the procedures, while 10.14 million have migrated to the mainnet. The launch of the Open Network is a key step toward making the Pi token publicly accessible, as it will allow exchanges to list it. Some leading platforms, such as OKX, Bitget, and MEXC, have already revealed their intentions to enable trading services with the asset next week. On the other hand, others have stood aside. Bybit’s CEO Ben Zhou , for instance, explicitly stated that the exchange will not embrace it. Where Next for BTC? The price of the primary cryptocurrency has been rather unstable in the past week, ranging from below $95K to almost $100K. Currently, Bitcoin (BTC) trades at approximately $97,000 (per CoinGecko’s data), with some analysts envisioning substantial gains in the near future . BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko The X user CRYPTOWZRD recently assumed that the valuation could soon break above the $100,000 resistance level, where “there will be a psychological value for retail traders, leading them to pour more money into the market.” The analyst also envisioned that BTC could then surpass the next resistance target of $108,000 and head toward a new all-time high. Others, like Ali Martinez, suggested that the asset could experience an additional correction in the upcoming future. He claimed that BTC’s most important resistance level is $97,530, saying that support below $92,110 is weak. Martinez hinted that falling under that mark could lead to a significant decline, as there is a gap between $90,000 and $70,000. Meme Coin Outlook Last but not least , we will touch upon the meme coin sector, whose market capitalization has slightly increased to almost $80 billion. The top performers today (February 14) include Popcat (POPCAT), dogwifhat (WIF), and SPX6900 (SPX), whose prices have risen between 6% and 12%. Interestingly, POPCAT also led the pack yesterday after receiving support from Coinbase. The leaders in terms of market capitalization – Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) – are also in the green, albeit charting more modest gains. Those recording some price declines in the past 24 hours are ai16z (AI16Z), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), AI Companions (AIC), and others.

This reversal was abrupt and significant, confirming that the support at $600 is well defended by buyers. At the time of this post, BNB is under the key resistance at $700. Chart by Tradingview 2.

However, as soon as the price moved above $700 sellers dominated with the highest daily volume recorded so far in 2025.

With a significant boom expected before April 2025, pinpointing these promising cryptos could be crucial. This article reveals five tokens that could yield extraordinary returns, offering insights into opportunities that are too significant to ignore. DOGEN Surges 500% – Could This Be the Next $100M+ Solana Meme Coin? DOGEN is making waves, and if you're overlooking it, you might be passing up one of the most exciting meme coin rallies of 2025. After a 500% increase following its DEX listing, DOGEN is gaining serious traction, with a CEX listing expected soon. The bulls are already gearing up for more action. This Solana-based meme coin is positioning itself as the preferred option for savvy investors, and the buzz surrounding it continues to grow. 📈 DOGEN’s Price Continues Its Ascent Since its debut on Raydium DEX on February 4th, DOGEN has soared to $0.0066 before stabilizing around $0.002. Even at this point, it's still up 566% from its lowest presale price of $0.0003, delivering an incredible return for early backers. The presale for DOGEN raised $5.5 million, highlighting strong initial demand. Unlike the random meme coins that appear daily, DOGEN has already established a community of over 30,000 followers on X, indicating significant long-term engagement. DOGEN’s Next Leap is Approaching – Join Before It Takes Off! 🔥 CEX Listing = FOMO on the Horizon? Meme coins thrive on hype and easy access, and a centralized exchange (CEX) listing could provide the boost DOGEN needs for its next upward move. Historically, CEX listings have been substantial catalysts for tokens, bringing in new liquidity and attracting buyers who missed out on the presale. The eezzy’s journal channel (with over 50,000 subscribers) has already pointed out DOGEN as a potential leader among Solana meme coins, with a shot at reaching a market cap of over $100 million. If that materializes, we could see a potential 5x increase from the current levels. Is it time to dive in? DOGEN is exhibiting all the characteristics of a meme coin ready for another explosive rise. With strong fundamentals, a limited supply, an active community, and an impending CEX listing, it stands as a high-risk, high-reward opportunity. If you missed the initial 500% rise, there might still be a chance to catch the next wave. But once the CEX listing FOMO begins, opportunities may quickly disappear. Do your own research (DYOR), but don’t say you weren’t alerted. 💎🐶 Are you ready to go all-in on DOGEN? OM: MANTRA - A Blockchain Focused on Security and Regulatory Compliance OM: MANTRA is a Layer 1 blockchain emphasizing security and regulatory compliance. Built with the Cosmos SDK, it supports Inter-Blockchain Communication and is compatible with CosmWasm for smart contracts. The network's security is underpinned by its own Proof-of-Stake validator set, capable of handling up to 10,000 transactions per second. It offers modules, SDKs, and APIs for creating, trading, and managing real-world assets that comply with regulations. Its goal is to enhance the user experience for institutions and users new to Web3. With its focus on compliance and performance, OM: MANTRA presents a compelling opportunity for investors seeking compliant blockchain solutions in today’s market. Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR): An Innovative Alternative to Conventional Blockchains Hedera Hashgraph operates as a decentralized network using hashgraph technology, setting it apart from traditional blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It aims to enhance efficiency with faster transactions, reduced costs, and environmental benefits due to the absence of mining. HBAR, its native currency, is used for transaction fees and securing the network via a Proof of Stake system. While offering a secure and cost-effective platform for transactions and smart contracts, Hedera faces challenges in gaining momentum within the competitive blockchain landscape. Its patented technology could limit wider community involvement compared to open-source projects. Nonetheless, supported by major industry players, Hedera Hashgraph holds promise in the evolution of digital transactions and applications, marking its prospects as noteworthy in the current market cycle. VeChain (VET): Leveraging Blockchain for Supply Chain Transparency VeChain (VET) is a blockchain platform that enhances supply chain management through smart contract solutions. It assigns unique IDs and sensors to physical products, allowing for detailed tracking at every stage of the supply chain. This technology enhances transparency and authenticity verification, which is especially valuable in industries like luxury fashion, groceries, and automotive manufacturing. Founded by Sunny Lu in 2015, VeChain migrated to its own blockchain, VeChainThor, in 2018, introducing a dual-token system with VET and VeThor Token (VTHO). Collaborations with leading companies such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, Walmart China, and BMW highlight its practical adoption. With its real-world applications and expanding ecosystem, VeChain's technology shows strong potential, making it appealing in the current market cycle. Render Token (RENDER): Empowering Creators with Decentralized GPU Rendering Render Token (RENDER) is the utility token of The Render Network, providing decentralized GPU-rendering solutions. It allows creators to access GPU power for rendering tasks more effectively and at reduced costs. Node operators supply spare GPU capacity and earn RENDER tokens as compensation. This framework supports the production of animation, motion graphics, and visual effects through a distributed network of processing power. The token holds promise due to its applicability in the expanding fields of graphics and visual content creation. Its significance in the current market cycle depends on the demand for decentralized rendering solutions and the adoption of its technology. Final Thoughts While tokens like OM, HBAR, VET, and RENDER may have less immediate potential, DOGEN stands out for those pursuing luxury and success. With an anticipated 700% increase by the end of the presale and the possibility of achieving thousand-fold returns, DOGEN follows in the footsteps of successful tokens like BONK, WIF, and Popcat. By building a community of leading investors, it offers tangible benefits and exclusive perks for early participants.

That’s why it has chosen the community-driven presale strategy with a smart plan: Entry Price at Stage One: $0.003333333 (because three is a lucky number) Final Stage Price: $0.151515152 (because round numbers are boring) First-Stage Discount: 98% Translation: Buy early, pay less. Post-Presale Mission Expansion Think of the presale as a training for the big mission. Once the $AGNT token goes public, the mission will expand to strategic KOL partnerships and development of AI powered tools to fuel growth and engagement. Top-Secret Tokenomics (No Funny Business) This is a community-first operation, so 25% the total token supply is allocated for staking and rewards. Agent A.I. isn’t just throwing tokens around like confetti. The supply is capped at 5 billion, ensuring no surprise inflation bombs. Further breaking down the tokemonics, only 20% of the supply is allocated for the presale. The offer at a discounted price is limited. Final Orders: Deploy Capital & Secure Your $AGNT Now This is your shot to join crypto’s most ridiculous yet lucrative mission. The best entries go to the fastest trigger fingers. Don’t be the guy who “wished he got in early.” The mission is set. The presale is live. Are you in, or will you let the AI fakes win? Buy $AGNT Early for a Bigger Discount SUI Soars: The Rise of Sui Token and Its Promising Future SUI, the native token of the Sui blockchain, surged in late 2023 and early 2024. Exceeding $1, it hit $2.18 by March 27. This rapid rise put SUI on the radar of many investors. After a dip, SUI rebounded in autumn, reaching a new all-time high of $2.36 on October 14. By year’s end, it peaked at $5.35. This was driven by the Total Value Locked surpassing $2 billion. Christian Williams, Sui Foundation’s managing director, expressed pride in the growth. “When Sui launched in 2023, we knew it would push the industry forward. The community’s organic development is remarkable,” he said. Looking ahead, predictions suggest SUI could be between $2.40 and $3.60 by end of 2025. In 2026, it might range from $1.03 to $1.27. By 2030, forecasts place it between $25 and $37, indicating strong long-term potential. Sui offers a faster, more efficient blockchain. Built on Sui Move, it enhances scalability and cuts costs. As an innovative alternative to Ethereum, its technology and growth make it attractive in today’s market. SUI’s journey hints at a promising future. AI16Z: The Memecoin Making Waves on Solana in 2025 AI16Z, a memecoin based on the Solana blockchain, has been the talk of the crypto community in 2025. Inspired by venture capitalist and tech guru Marc Andreessen, it’s both a tribute and a parody that has captured investors’ attention. After a strong performance in late 2024, AI16Z peaked at an all-time high in early January 2025. The coin’s price saw a dip after its peak, but recent developments have reignited interest. A proposed update to its Eliza AI operating system has investors hopeful. Between January 20 and January 22, 2025, AI16Z’s price rose from below $0.80 to about $1.25, indicating renewed momentum. As a speculative memecoin, AI16Z operates on the simple premise of buying, holding, and trading in hopes of value appreciation. Its connection to Marc Andreessen adds a layer of intrigue, attracting those who enjoy the blend of tech culture and cryptocurrency. The potential of AI16Z lies in its community and the upcoming Eliza AI update. In a market where memecoins often fade quickly, AI16Z’s sustained interest suggests it could be more than a fleeting trend. However, the absence of detailed technical documentation could be a concern for some investors. Looking ahead, the short-term price prediction for AI16Z appears optimistic, especially with the anticipated updates. While it’s hard to predict the long-term trajectory without more history, the coin’s recent performance hints at promising prospects in the current market cycle. ONDO’s Journey: Bridging Real Assets with DeFi Ondo Finance is transforming decentralized finance by bringing real-world assets on-chain. It offers institutional-grade liquidity solutions, making financial products accessible to all. Launched on January 18, 2024, ONDO’s price surged rapidly until March, peaking in June. It dipped afterward but rose again due to interest in real-world asset cryptos, hitting an all-time high on December 16. By January 20, 2025, ONDO was valued at about $1.45. Price predictions as of January 20, 2025, show optimism for ONDO. For 2025, forecasts range from $1.50 to $3.50. In 2026, projections span $2 to $6. By 2030, expectations are between $5 and $12, reflecting potential growth as ONDO gains adoption. Ondo Finance uses on-chain asset management, allowing investors to mint tokens backed by assets like US Treasuries. Its platform enables easy subscription, redemption, and transfer of tokens. The whitepaper emphasizes making institutional-grade financial products available to everyone through blockchain technology and best practices in finance. With its innovative approach and historical price movement, ONDO stands out in the current market. The integration of real assets with DeFi could drive further interest. While predicting the future isn’t certain, ONDO’s focus on accessibility and transparency positions it well in the evolving crypto space. OFFICIAL TRUMP Coin Takes the Crypto World by Storm in 2025 Launched in January 2025, OFFICIAL TRUMP is the official meme coin of the 47th American president, Donald Trump. It quickly gained traction, becoming one of the largest meme coins by market capitalization. Unlike earlier Trump-themed coins like MAGA and Doland Tremp, this coin has direct affiliation, capturing the imagination of supporters and crypto enthusiasts alike. Despite lacking a specific use case, roadmap, or whitepaper, OFFICIAL TRUMP’s potential lies in its strong branding and the hype surrounding it. Its connection to a prominent figure has propelled it into the spotlight, drawing in investors looking to capitalize on its popularity. The coin operates on a centralized model, with all decisions made by the founding team. In the current bullish market, OFFICIAL TRUMP looks attractive to many traders. It’s listed on major exchanges, allowing for easy access and trading. The limited initial circulation of 20% of its total supply has created scarcity, fueling demand and driving up its value. Historically, the coin experienced a rapid rise after its launch, driven by enthusiasm and fear of missing out (FOMO). Predictions suggest that by the end of 2025, OFFICIAL TRUMP could reach a price of $98.05, potentially boasting a market capitalization of around $19 billion. Looking ahead, as more TRUMP tokens enter circulation, price adjustments are expected. By the end of 2026, the price might adjust to $44.07 due to the increased supply. By 2030, with all one billion tokens in circulation and Donald Trump no longer in office, the coin could stabilize around $11.08, having completed its impressive journey in the crypto market. Conclusion In the current crypto bull run, coins like SHIB and ADA are losing momentum. Even newcomers such as SUI, AI16Z, ONDO, and TRUMP show less potential in the short term. Smart investors are focusing on innovative projects that offer unique opportunities. One such project is Agent A.I., a memecoin inspired by the successful PEPE coin. Agent A.I. stands out by embracing real artificial intelligence and a community-driven approach. It has a capped supply of 5 billion tokens and offers significant discounts during its presale. After the presale, the project plans to expand with strategic partnerships and AI-powered tools. This presents an attractive opportunity for early participants aiming for substantial growth.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. BLEM enters the spotlight with its GambleFi protocol as ADA and DOGE stage a slight rebound. Table of Contents BitLemons to transform the $450b casino industry Cardano surges Dogecoin’s uptick Conclusion The crypto market shows promising signs of recovery as Cardano (ADA) and Dogecoin (DOGE) post impressive gains. Meanwhile, an emerging GambleFi protocol, BitLemons (BLEM), is capturing significant investor attention with its revenue-sharing model. BitLemons to transform the $450b casino industry The crypto gaming sector has a new rising star, BitLemons, which has already secured an impressive $1 million in private seed funding. What sets this protocol apart is its approach to revenue sharing, allocating a substantial 30% of its Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) to benefit token holders. This tokenomics model will split the allocated GGR, with 15% dedicated to token buyback and burn mechanisms, while another 15% will reward stakers. With an entry price point of $0.01, early investors are positioning themselves to potentially benefit from both the protocol’s growth and its deflationary mechanics. Unlike traditional casino platforms, BitLemons will operate as a fully functional decentralized crypto casino, bringing blockchain transparency and efficiency to an industry ripe for disruption. The protocol’s strategic focus on the $450 billion casino market presents a notable opportunity for early adopters.

The surge coincides with developers teasing a dApp store concept, which has ignited fresh enthusiasm within the Cardano ecosystem. ADA has established solid support at $0.75, with resistance levels being tested at $0.80. The market cap has grown to $28.06b, reflecting growing institutional interest in Cardano’s research-driven approach. Dogecoin’s uptick Dogecoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience, recording a 5.50% increase over the past week. The meme coin’s latest surge has been fueled by heightened social media activity and a significant uptick in trading volume. The technical indicators show DOGE maintaining steady support at $0.25, with immediate resistance at $0.27. The asset’s market cap of $38.87b and improving market sentiment suggest the potential for further upside movement. Conclusion While established cryptocurrencies like ADA and DOGE continue to show strength, BitLemons presents a unique opportunity to get in on a potentially transformative GambleFi protocol. With its strategic position in the casino market, real revenue generation, deflationary mechanics, and an entry price point at $0.01, BLEM could be the next crypto success story.

The teenage sensation allocated $200,000 to FloppyPepe (FPPE), claiming it reminds him of buying Pepe (PEPE) in its earliest stages when it traded at $0.000001 before skyrocketing. According to the teen Dogecoin millionaire, he is going all-in on FloppyPepe (FPPE) like he did with DOGE and Pepe (PEPE) some years back. Investing Early: A Blueprint For Success The teen Dogecoin millionaire references Pepe (PEPE) due to its historic rise from $0.000001 to an $8 billion market cap. The young DOGE and Pepe (PEPE) investor made huge gains by buying early, so it is no wonder he is targeting FloppyPepe (FPPE) with the same strategy. Moreover, investing early is not new for this young Dogecoin millionaire, as this strategy made him millions of dollars with DOGE. Spotting DOGE early, the teen Dogecoin millionaire invested about $1,000 after analyzing the potential of the meme coin. Acting fast paid off as he raked in millions in returns from DOGE. The teen Dogecoin millionaire is back after taking a break from the meme coin space. This time, his investment is enormous and bold: $200,000 in FloppyPepe (FPPE), a new meme coin. Why is he investing so much? FloppyPepe (FPPE), The Next Millionaire Maker “What caught my attention is the meme coin’s potential as it cleverly integrates real-world utility and AI technology at a time when AI adoption is growing massively. This is what Pepe (PEPE) and DOGE wished they had,” the Dogecoin millionaire stated. His whooping $200,000 investment in the ongoing FloppyPepe (FPPE) presale has triggered a wave of interest, and experts predict a presale inflow of up to $2 million in the first two weeks. The young investor emphasized FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) connection to Matt Furie’s legacy as a key factor in his investment decision, as the new meme coin will be inheriting branding and a proven successful formula in the meme coin space, which Pepe (PEPE) and Brett (BRETT) has enjoyed. More importantly, using AI to engineer tools for creating NFTs and videos is even more captivating for the Dogecoin millionaire. For instance, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Meme-o-Matic platform is an AI-powered tool that allows users to turn memes into NFTs monetized in different marketplaces. Its Floppy X technology can create viral and entertaining video content in seconds. These utilities, which include partnerships with NGOs to give 1% of transactions to support wildlife conservation and protection of endangered species, have also piqued institutional interest. Buyers are securing their spot and buying the presale while it’s still early and selling at $0.0000002 . Like Pepe’s (PEPE) massive rise from a low selling price of $0.000001, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is poised to shoot through the roof when it launches. According to the teen Dogecoin millionaire, as the first meme coin set to combine AI technology, real-world social initiative, excellent deflationary model, meme DAO protocol, and multi-chain expansion altogether, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is a gem. With prices likely to increase soon, join the Dogecoin millionaire and invest now. Buying the token also unlocks premium features like low transaction costs, yield farming, and enhanced security options, among other exciting benefits. Conclusion As FloppyPepe (FPPE) looks to rewrite the capabilities of meme coins, take this opportunity to invest early like this savvy teen Dogecoin millionaire who is out to replicate his success in spotting early opportunities in the meme coin space. Compared to Pepe (PEPE), when it traded at $0.000001, this AI meme coin is also set to do high numbers soon. SolidProof, a smart contract auditing company, has audited and certified FloppyPepe (FPPE), further bolstering the confidence of many investors.

The crypto community is buzzing about this trader's latest prediction, highlighting a coin with the potential to multiply its value 25 times. As the cryptocurrency market heats up once more, investors are eagerly searching for the next big opportunity. One of the intriguing options is a fresh player, Mission Briefing: Agent A.I., touted as a true memecoin with a community-centric vision. Enthusiasm is mounting as insiders closely monitor this bold initiative. Agent A.I.: Blending AI Capabilities with Meme Coin Popularity Agent A.I. is an emerging cryptocurrency project that fuses AI technology with the viral attraction of meme coins, two of the most significant trends in the current landscape. Interest in AI-driven cryptocurrencies has surged, with blockchain-based AI solutions gaining traction among investors. However, not all AI tokens are equal—many merely exploit the ""AI"" label for marketing without delivering substantial value. Agent A.I.'s Role in the Crypto-AI Surge In contrast, Agent A.I. seeks to integrate AI advancements with blockchain utility, while also challenging projects that fail to deliver on their AI promises. This strategy allows Agent A.I. to differentiate itself in an ever-expanding market. Agent A.I. is crafted to be an intelligent and adaptable platform. According to its creators, the project’s AI architecture can: Process large datasets in fractions of a second to enhance decision-making Boost processing capabilities to rival leading cloud services Continuously improve its functionality by learning and evolving over time. The team behind Agent A.I. is dedicated to enhancing both AI features and blockchain integration, ensuring the technology progresses alongside the cryptocurrency market. A Savvy Presale Plan for Initial Investors Agent A.I. has opted for a community-focused presale strategy, offering early backers the chance to invest in the project at favorable prices. The presale is organized in multiple stages, aiming to reward early investors with substantial discounts: During stage 1, the $AGNT token is priced at $0.003333333. It will pass through 28 stages, reaching $0.151515152 by the presale's conclusion. Early buyers enjoy a significant 98% discount at this initial stage. This pricing strategy implies that the sooner you invest, the larger the discount you receive. Secure Your $AGNT Before the Next Price Increase Why $AGNT Stands Out as an Investment Agent A.I. merges two of the most appealing aspects of today’s cryptocurrency market: AI-based innovation and the viral nature of meme coins. The project’s commitment to genuine AI capabilities and community-focused expansion sets it apart in the crowded field of new crypto offerings. With a limited presale supply and rising price tiers, $AGNT presents early investors with the chance for notable returns as its adoption grows. Join the Growing Agent A.I. Community – Become Part of the Mission Today! XRP's Price Ascends Toward a Critical Resistance Level XRP has experienced a significant price increase recently. Over the last week, its value climbed by 10.42%, positioning it between $1.86 and $2.86, indicating rising investor interest. In the past month, XRP saw a minor decline of 3.71%. However, over a six-month period, the coin's value has surged by 353.44%, reflecting strong long-term growth potential. The next resistance level stands at $3.32. Should XRP surpass this threshold, further price increases may follow. Meanwhile, the closest support level is at $1.33, which could help prevent substantial price declines. The RSI is at 66.95, nearing the overbought zone. This might indicate a possible short-term pullback. Nevertheless, if the positive momentum persists, XRP’s price could head toward the resistance level, possibly rising by around 16% from its current upper range. Dogecoin Shows Signs of Recovery as Bullish Indicators Appear Dogecoin's price is showing signs of recovery, having risen over 6% in the last week to range between $0.2042 and $0.2935. This comes after a 26% drop over the past month, suggesting a potential rebound. The Relative Strength Index is at 56.71, indicating a mild bullish trend. If this momentum continues, Dogecoin might rise to challenge the nearest resistance at $0.3379, which would represent a 35% increase from its current price range. Conversely, if prices fall, the nearest support is at $0.1593. A drop to this level would represent a decrease of roughly 36%, highlighting considerable downside risk. Despite short-term fluctuations, Dogecoin has surged 156% over the past six months, underscoring its potential for further gains in the crypto market. Conclusion Considering recent market dynamics, established cryptocurrencies like XRP and DOGE might offer limited short-term growth. While their past performances have been noteworthy, they may not yield the significant returns some investors seek in the current bullish phase. A new player, Agent A.I., is gaining attention in the crypto arena. This memecoin aims to distinguish itself by blending humor with genuine profit potential. It provides a community-driven presale featuring substantial discounts for early participants. With a capped supply of 5 billion tokens and a strategic growth and engagement plan, Agent A.I. offers a fresh opportunity for those looking to capitalize on emerging market trends.

While this doesn’t mean approval is guaranteed, it’s a major step forward, especially under the new SEC leadership. Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart believe there’s now a 65% chance of an XRP ETF getting the green light, which could bring a fresh flood of institutional money into the token. SO, for everyone asking what this means — the SEC has *acknowledged* @Grayscale / @NYSE ’s 19b-4 application to convert its $XRP Trust into an ETF. No, it doesn’t mean automatic approval and it doesn’t even guarantee the SEC will approve it down the line. So why is it notable?… https://t.co/GICXgobYsZ — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) February 13, 2025 But it’s not just XRP in the spotlight— Dogecoin is also in the ETF race . The SEC acknowledged the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) 19b-4 filing for both XRP and Dogecoin ETFs, marking the start of the review process. Analyst James Seyffart shared the news on X, emphasizing that this was expected but is still an important milestone. His post highlights that the “clock” for a decision has officially started for both XRP and Dogecoin. With Dogecoin being the eighth-largest cryptocurrency, its ETF could be a game-changer, pushing the meme coin into mainstream finance. Whereas XRP ETF will boost XRP adoption and price. The SEC has now invited public comments on Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF proposal, with responses due within 21 days. After that, the agency will decide whether to approve, reject, or extend the decision-making process. But Jeremy Hogan says , the realistic timeline to approve S1 ETF fillings would be 8-12 months. What This Means for Ripple The acknowledgment of an XRP ETF filing comes as Ripple is still battling the SEC in court . Many believe that if the SEC approves an XRP ETF, it could signal the end of Ripple’s legal troubles. Some experts even speculate that XRP could be classified as not a security, clearing a massive hurdle for its future.

Ripple has concentrated on using blockchain technology to enhance international payment networks under his direction. Entrepreneur Investor Chief Executive Officer Board Member reacted to the news , calling an XRP ETF “inevitable.” He has long believed this would happen, and now, the SEC’s acknowledgment makes it feel closer to reality. Ripple President Monica Long also expressed confidence that XRP is next in line for ETF approval. Meanwhile, Analyst Nate Geraci weighed in, stating that the SEC’s move signals a big shift in sentiment toward XRP, despite Ripple’s legal challenges. Optimism is growing as the SEC under its new administration appears to be scaling back its aggressive crypto enforcement. Moreover, the SEC is expected to acknowledge other XRP ETF filings from Bitwise , Canary Capital, WisdomTree, and 21Shares. Once listed in the federal register, a 240-day window begins for the agency to decide on approval. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction for February 14 , XRP Current Market Sentiment XRP is already up 4% since the news broke, currently testing resistance at $2.55. If it breaks past $2.72 and flips it into support, it could confirm a rounded bottom pattern, pushing prices toward $3.15. Technical indicators like the RSI and MACD are crossed above the moving average suggesting a bullish sign. However, if XRP faces rejection at key levels, a drop to $2.26 could be on the cards. With both XRP and Dogecoin ETFs now in play, the big question remains—which one will get approved first? If XRP wins, it could mark a new era for the token and the entire crypto market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Ethereum (ETH) There are good signs that Ethereum may have bottomed here and a reversal is just beginning after a difficult start in February. While the price is only up by 1% this week, this reversal could bring back buyers and see the cryptocurrency make more gains later. ETH found good support at $2,600, and if it manages to break above $2,800, then it will have a chance to return on a sustained rally that can get it back above $3,000. While buyers are still shy, they have a real opportunity to take back the control. Looking ahead, the remaining weeks in February could see Ethereum make steady gains. To be confident this can happen, bulls will have to break above $2,800 and $3,000. Chart by Tradingview Ripple ( XRP ) XRP had a great week after its price increased by 16%. Even so, it did not manage to reach $3 or go above that level which continues to act as a key resistance. Until XRP breaks above this psychological level, there is still a threat of sellers returning. The current momentum is bullish and may well be enough to test the key resistance. The question is if XRP can break $3 and turn it into a key support. If successful, then the price will be free to get closer to $3.4 which is the current all-time high. Looking ahead, XRP needs to show higher highs and higher lows to return on a clear uptrend. Until that happens, it’s best to be cautious here. Chart by Tradingview Cardano (ADA) ADA found great support at 64 cents, and since then, the price made steady gains increasing by 13% this week. The biggest challenge on the chart right now is the resistance at 90 cents which will likely try to prevent any attempts from buyers to take this cryptocurrency back to $1 or beyond. While the current momentum is bullish, buyers have to turn 90 cents into a key support to consolidate their positions. Until then, sellers could return at any moment to regain control. Looking ahead, ADA has a real chance to reverse the downtrend here. While the current gains are encouraging, bulls will have to maintain this momentum to be successful. Chart by Tradingview Binance Coin (BNB) Binance Coin had a great week with a 15% price increase after buyers rushed to this cryptocurrency which went above $700 for a brief period. However, sellers came in force there and managed to push back the price under this key level which also serves as a resistance. While $700 remains a stronghold for sellers, bulls managed to take BNB to a very comfortable level in the past 10 days. This allowed them to recover a lot of lost ground after the price touched $500 in early February. Looking ahead, this cryptocurrency may take its time to break above $700, but this could eventually happen once buyers gather the strength for a new push. For now, sellers seem determined to make a stand at the key resistance. Chart by Tradingview Solana (SOL) Unfortunately for Solana, it did not really move much this past week, closing with a modest 1.7% price increase. This mirrors Ethereum’s price action, but in the case of SOL, it could be interpreted as a sign of weakness. The resistance is found at $206 and buyers failed to break it despite several attempts in February. While this key level may fall if the overall market returns on an uptrend, Solana seems to struggle to find buyers at this time. Looking ahead, if sellers return, Solana has good support at $164 and could revisit this level before buyers become interested again. The alternative is a clean break above $206 which can improve the sentiment and begin a new rally.

This move has fueled a 160% surge in BROCCOLI price, making it one of the hottest tokens in the market. Notably, social media hype and speculation continue to push its value higher, with whale transactions adding to the frenzy. Crypto Whale Buys 40M CZ’s Dog; Becomes Largest Holder A crypto whale recently acquired nearly 40 million Broccoli tokens, becoming its largest holder. According to Loononchain data , the whale spent 7,431 BNB, worth approximately $5 million, to buy CZ’s Dog at an average price of $0.1264. This transaction has heightened investor interest, driving further demand for the token. Meanwhile, another report revealed that a separate whale invested $2.54 million in two Broccoli-themed memecoins. While one investment has yielded a 24.7% profit, the other is currently at a 68.1% loss. Source: Lookonchain, X Despite these mixed results, the crypto whales continue to dive into CZ-inspired tokens, believing in their potential for further growth. Besides, the influence of the former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has further added to the bullish sentiment of the asset market. CZ’s Dog Sparks Meme Coin Frenzy: BROCCOLI Price Soars Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, aka CZ, first revealed his dog’s name Broccoli in a social media post on X on February 13. This announcement ignited a wave of Broccoli-themed meme coins across various blockchain networks. Over 480 Broccoli tokens have launched on Solana’s Pump.fun, while BNB Smart Chain’s Four.Meme has seen at least 300 similar tokens emerge, gaining the crypto whales’ attention. Among these, one Broccoli-themed memecoin on Solana skyrocketed to a $1.5 billion market cap on the same day. However, despite the overwhelming hype, CZ clarified that he has no involvement in launching any of these tokens. Meanwhile, a token, CZ’s Dog or BROCCOLI price rocketed 158% to $0.1335 today with a market cap of $122.56 million. Notably, the 24-hour trading volume of the token touched $604.01 million, indicating the heavy interest of the market participants towards the crypto. Broccoli Price Broccoli Price Surge Aids In Dog-Themed Meme Coins’ Rally Dog-themed memecoins have dominated the crypto scene lately, with crypto whales shifting their focus towards the assets. Notably, the buzz over the BROCCOLI token places it alongside other top dog-themed meme coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Floki Inu (FLOKI), and Dogwifhat (WIF), all of which have seen significant price rallies. As of writing, DOGE price was up over 3.5% and traded at $0.2672, with SHIB and FLOKI adding about 1% to their prices. Besides, DOG price surged more than 4% while dogwifhat (WIF) price jumped more than 10% amid the CZ’s Dog buzz. However, the growing interest in dog-themed memecoins isn’t new. Despite that, CZ’s influence and the ongoing whale activity have made Broccoli a standout token in this category. As the meme coin market remains highly speculative, investors are closely watching Broccoli’s next moves.

Wall Street may be underestimating the company's prospects, JMP said. ""You ain't seen nothing yet,"" analysts led by Devin Ryan wrote, and if the ""transaction pace continues, 1Q25 revenues would exceed current Street consensus by nearly 30%."" There is a ""seismic shift"" happening in the industry, the report said, and the crypto exchange's positive momentum doesn't reflect some of the changes that are still yet to come. JMP expects huge growth for Coinbase and estimates that the company will be multiples of its current size in the coming five years.

It traded near the upper mark on February 7, but in the following days, it suffered a severe downfall. BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko The price tumbled to its local bottom of less than $95,000 on February 12, shortly after the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics released the Consumer Price Index data for January . The actual inflation rate was higher than expectations which caused the entire crypto market to head south. The following day, though, BTC bulls regained control and pushed the valuation to as high as $98,000. However, the rally was short-lived, and the price once again plunged below $95,500. Over the past several hours, though, there has been a new resurgence, and BTC currently trades just north of $97,000. The asset’s market capitalization is well above $1.9 trillion, whereas its dominance against the alternative coins slightly decreased to approximately 59.6% (per CoinMarketCap’s data). XRP Shoots Up As mentioned above, most altcoins have outperformed BTC in terms of daily gains. The biggest rival – Ethereum (ETH) – is up by 1.5%, while Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Cardano (ADA) have witnessed increases of 3% to 5%. The best performer from the top 20 club today is undoubtedly Ripple’s XRP. Its price soared by 12%, reaching a 10-day high of $2.75. This happened shortly after the US SEC acknowledged Grayscale’s application to convert its XRP Trust into an exchange-traded fund (ETF). While the sector’s landscape is predominantly green, there are some assets experiencing decreases. Binance Coin (BNB), which was at the forefronts of gains on February 13, is down 5% in the last 24 hours, whereas TRON (TRX) has slipped by 3%. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has climbed to $3.23 trillion, representing a 1.5% increase for the day.
