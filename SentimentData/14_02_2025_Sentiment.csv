In a recent tweet, John Reed Stark, a former official at the SEC, claimed in this regard that the agency’s crypto enforcement division is now “dead and buried.” The SEC Crypto Unit is Now Unofficially Dead and Buried Per LinkedIn, the SEC’s “Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit,” is now the “Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit.” It won’t be long before the SEC’s website reflects the new name. Stick a fork in SEC crypto-enforcement, it’s done. pic.twitter.com/9JkywyZ30Q — John Reed Stark (@JohnReedStark) February 13, 2025 The SEC recently changed the name of the enforcement units related to cryptocurrencies on LinkedIn from “crypto assets” to “emerging technologies.” According to Stark , the move was initiated by the Acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda to effectively disband crypto enforcement. Stark also further opined that the SEC would tone down on operations regarding cryptocurrencies. He said that the agency might withdraw or dismiss some of the already pending cases. The SEC paused its case against Binance for two months earlier this week adding to the belief of the dwindling enforcement activities. Currently, the SEC has not formally addressed the rebranding of the agency’s crypto enforcement unit. However, Stark opined that the agency’s website would soon change in the same regard. He stated, “It won’t be long before the SEC’s website reflects this new name. Perhaps the SEC will roll out the new name as some sort of feeble rebranding attempt.” SEC reevaluates crypto regulation strategy During a recent interview , commissioner Hester Peirce also acknowledged that the agency is reevaluating its approach to the crypto sphere. The SEC has often used enforcement actions to mediate the industry while recognizing that such measures are not conventional in policymaking. She insisted that they need rules and structure, not to pursue litigation-based regulation. “During the past several years, enforcement cases have been used as a way to make regulatory policy; that is very atypical,” Peirce stated. “We’re trying to get back to a path where we’re really using our other tools to make policy.” As noted by Stark, the SEC recently asked for a sixty-day stop to its ongoing legal case against Binance. In its defense, the agency stated the crypto task force would affect ongoing legal cases. The agency’s new direction may affect its former actions under the latest updated enforcement strategy. New task force and legal case reviews Peirce is currently leading the SEC’s crypto division, which focuses on creating a legal framework for the use of cryptocurrencies. The unit is tasked with determining which cryptocurrencies are securities and the SEC’s regulatory role in the market. The agency is also considering active litigation with leading crypto companies such as Binance, Ripple, and Coinbase. Peirce did not clarify whether there would be any dismissal of cases, but she said all would be decided on a case-by-case basis.“It’s facts and circumstances,” she said. “We’ll have to look at each case and its merits as we go forward.” Some cases have already experienced delays. In the SEC’s lawsuit against Lejilex, the two parties decided to postpone the oral arguments, which were initially planned for February 20th, increasing the decision duration to at least April 11, 2025. The uncertainty regarding cryptocurrency under the SEC has shifted alongside other regulatory policies under Trump’s presidency. After his Inauguration, President Donald Trump issued an executive order to create a panel that will consider how crypto is regulated. The government is also exploring the idea of creating a national crypto stockpile, which might influence the industry’s progress.

Despite a sharp rally to as high as $3.4, XRP has cooled down, now hovering around $2.50. While Ripple (XRP) still has the potential to rise again with factors like ETF hype, and regulatory changes in the U.S., the surrounding excitement has definitely cooled. At its current price of $2.47, Ripple (XRP) has already had its big moment. Now, the attention is shifting to a token with even more potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently priced at the lowest entry of $0.01, MUTM is attracting serious interest from crypto bulls. Having predictions pointing to a 100x gain to $1, it’s the kind of opportunity XRP investors can only dream of at this point. Unlike Ripple (XRP), which is riding out its post-rally phase, Mutuum Finance is still in the first phase of its presale, offering a fresh chance for massive returns. Additionally, its DeFi platform with features like Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending is drawing in investors looking for real utility. While XRP may have had its time in the spotlight, MUTM is where the real growth potential lies. Mutuum Finance: Revolutionizing Crypto Lending Mutuum Finance is reshaping the DeFi market with its innovative dual lending models. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system automates lending through smart contracts, enabling users to earn up to 10% APY while borrowing against ETH collateral without selling their holdings. Meanwhile, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model removes intermediaries, allowing lenders to set their own rates and terms for a more flexible and transparent lending experience. Investor demand is surging as the MUTM presale moves through its initial phase. With tokens priced at $0.01, over 620 investors have already contributed $420,000, and the price is set to climb to $0.06 at launch, offering an impressive 600% gain before reaching major exchanges. Market analysts anticipate an even greater upside, with projections pointing toward a potential $1 target post-listing, making this a preferable early investment. Mutuum Finance is preparing to launch a collateral-backed stablecoin, designed to enhance financial stability and platform liquidity. Additionally, the introduction of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) will grant token holders governance rights, ensuring a transparent, community-driven future for the project. To reward its growing community, Mutuum Finance is hosting a $100,000 giveaway. Ten lucky winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens, making this an exciting incentive for early adopters. How To Buy MUTM Tokens Here is a simple process on how to buy MUTM tokens Set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet with crypto funds. Go to the Mutuum Finance presale page. Select your investment amount. Confirm the transaction. Receive your MUTM tokens, which can be claimed after the presale ends. While Ripple (XRP) already had its moment in the spotlight, the focus is now shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a promising altcoin that offers crypto bulls the opportunity to capitalize on its early-stage growth. The potential for substantial returns is undeniable With a presale price of just $0.01. Market analysts are projecting a 100x gain, with the price possibly reaching $1. Mutuum Finance’s innovative DeFi lending models and upcoming ecosystem expansions, including a USD-pegged stablecoin and a projected DAO, make it a project worth watching closely. Don’t miss out on this early opportunity, invest in MUTM now to be part of the next big thing in crypto.

However, the burning question is whether the price can rally past the $0.05 mark or whether a new underdog altcoin, WallitIQ (WLTQ) , will overshadow it as its $0.0420 presale explodes. WallitIQ (WLTQ): The Underdog Altcoin Presale Set To Explode Experts remain sure of a $0.10 target for the Shiba Inu price, but WallitIQ (WLTQ) presents something fresh and auspicious. The underdog altcoin is selling at $0.0420 in presale, giving investors a rare opportunity to get in early before it explodes. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform brings a whole new level of utility to the crypto market with features that will make it a household name in the coming months. The platform will soon launch its beta version , while its MVP build introduces a Scan and Pay QR code system for wallet addresses, eliminating the need to input addresses manually. Moreover, WallitIQ (WLTQ) offers incredible incentives for presale investors. Those who buy into the presale early can stake their tokens to earn an annual percentage yield (APY) of up to 180%, along with governance rights and discounted transaction fees. Through its referral program, WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale investors can earn bonuses in native tokens by inviting others to join the ecosystem. The underdog altcoin presale incentivizes current investors, creating a network effect that could drive up the altcoin’s value in the long run. WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale investors will always have the proper asset allocation for maximum profitability, as the crypto wallet’s predictive algorithms automatically rebalance portfolios based on market trends. Investors have been waiting for this level of automation and precision, and it is now available through the underdog altcoin’s presale. The SolidProof audit of WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) smart contract affirms that the platform is free from vulnerabilities and reduces the risk of malicious attacks or scams. The underdog altcoin presale presents a much more secure, utility-driven path to profitability, with the bonus of incredibly low presale prices. Shiba Inu Price: A $0.10 Target Still Possible, But Can It Rally Past $0.05? The Shiba Inu (SHIB) current price of $0.00001522 makes experts cautiously optimistic about its potential. While they agree that a $0.10 target is still possible, the path to that milestone isn’t smooth. Reaching $0.10 would require a staggering surge of over 500,000%, an incredibly challenging feat. Even hitting $0.05 is no small task, given the current market conditions The Shiba Inu price recently dropped to a six-month low of $0.00001160, only to recover slightly before falling again. Despite these challenges, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) community remains hopeful, with some experts pointing to its 13% rise in January as a sign of underlying strength. However, as the market becomes more competitive, questions arise: Can the Shiba Inu price rally past $0.05? The token’s market cap is still modest, but at $0.10, Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) market cap would skyrocket to a staggering $58.87 trillion. However, with the ongoing challenges and fierce competition from newer projects, it’s unclear whether the Shiba Inu price will see such a dramatic rise. Conclusion: Make Your Move To The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Altcoin Presale Now The Shiba Inu price forecast may hold hope for some experts, with a $0.10 target still in sight. Still, the real opportunity lies in the underdog altcoin WallitIQ (WLTQ) . With its unique AI-powered platform , staking rewards, and presale bonuses, the altcoin offers investors a chance to get in early and potentially see massive returns. While the Shiba Inu price forecast suggests that the $0.10 target could still be achievable, it’s far from guaranteed, requiring a monumental effort to surpass $0.05. However, like any opportunity, the window for maximum profits with the WallitIQ (WLTQ) underdog altcoin presale won’t stay open forever. Experts say investors should quickly take advantage of the altcoin’s unique high-yield utilities and potential. Buy WallitIQ (WLTQ) early during the $0.0420 presale and benefit from the potential to grow your investment exponentially as the underdog altcoin explodes.

The platform even plans to reward its loyal users with free $SEA tokens, though it has yet to reveal any further details. Devin Finzer, Co-founder and CEO of OpenSea, remarked : This represents an expansion of OpenSea from an NFT marketplace to a much broader platform for trading all types of cryptos. We think tokens and NFTs belong together in a single, powerful, delightful experience. Devin Finzer OpenSea will distribute SEA tokens to reward its users OpenSea’s new OS trading platform will support cross-chain token purchases and initially offer lower fees for its users. Moreover, OpenSea Foundation, a Cayman Islands-based institution, promised to distribute $SEA tokens to reward and engage NFT users and offer utility on the OS2 platform. The foundation has yet to specify when it will start distributing tokens or even how many tokens will go to its users. The company, however, confirmed that its planned airdrop will cover both active users and the platform’s first users. US users will also be eligible for the airdrop. Additionally, the company insists that SEA’s utility is meant to be long-term rather than short-lived speculation. It even posted on X the several advantages OS2 has to offer, including how consumers can now access NFTs and crypto tokens on the same platform and how the utility has 14 new chains, including ApeChain and BSL. Hu believes their new platform and token will help grow community support for NFTs Fizner argued that beta testers put emphasis on building speed, reliability, and quality of its new utility, saying the OS2 feels right. Additionally, James Hu, the general manager of the OpenSea Foundation, says that OS2 should help the community grow and improve the OpenSea ecosystem. He further states that the presence of the $SEA token will increase the incentive for community members to get involved and support the NFT ecosystem. So far, OpenSea’s annualized revenues are at $33 million after facilitating the trading of $190 million worth of NFTs in the previous month. However, its trading volume has dipped from its record highs in 2021.

This sharp decline has left investors on edge, fueling fear and uncertainty as Avalanche mirrors the bearish trends seen across the broader crypto market. Doubts about AVAX’s potential to recover and generate significant gains have started to dominate market sentiment, leaving many questioning whether a rebound is possible in the near term. Related Reading: Cardano Could Move Up To $0.83 If Momentum Holds – Can ADA Sustain A Breakout? However, amidst this uncertainty, there are signs that Avalanche may be preparing for a turnaround. According to key metrics shared by top analyst Ali Martinez, Avalanche is showing promising signs of a potential rebound. Martinez highlights that a key technical indicator has flashed a buy signal on the weekly chart, offering a glimmer of hope for a recovery rally. This signal suggests that AVAX might be nearing a bottom, and if market conditions align, it could mark the beginning of a new bullish phase. As the market remains volatile, all eyes are on Avalanche to see if this buy signal can translate into sustained upward momentum. Investors are cautiously optimistic, hoping that AVAX can overcome current challenges and reclaim its bullish potential. Avalanche Indicator Signals A Potential Trend Reversal Avalanche (AVAX) has been stuck in a state of indecision as bulls fail to reclaim the $27 mark, while bears struggle to push the price further down. This tug-of-war reflects the broader uncertainty in the crypto market, leaving Avalanche at a critical juncture. Analysts are divided on the next move for AVAX, with some predicting a massive recovery rally while others anticipate a continuation of the bearish trend that has gripped the market since mid-December. Top analyst Ali Martinez has added to the discussion by sharing a technical analysis on X that reveals promising signs for Avalanche. Martinez highlights that the TD Sequential indicator, a widely used tool for identifying trend exhaustion and potential price reversals, has flashed a buy signal on the weekly chart. This is significant, as weekly signals carry more weight and often suggest the possibility of long-term reversals. If bulls capitalize on this signal and push the price above the $27 resistance level, it could trigger a broader recovery phase. On the flip side, failure to hold current levels may lead to further consolidation or downside movement as bears attempt to regain control. Related Reading: Ethereum Whales Have Bought Over 600,000 ETH In The Past Week – Time For A Price Upswing? The coming days and weeks will be crucial for Avalanche, as the price action will either validate the bullish signal or reinforce the prevailing bearish sentiment. Investors are closely monitoring the $27 level and the implications of the TD Sequential signal, as it could mark the beginning of a long-awaited recovery rally for AVAX. AVAX Price Consolidates Between Key Levels Avalanche (AVAX) is trading at $25.6 after several days of indecision and consolidation within a narrow range, stuck below the $27 resistance level and above the $23 support zone. This tight range reflects the ongoing uncertainty in the broader market as bulls and bears battle for control. Bulls face a crucial test at current levels. They need to hold the $25 support zone and build momentum to push AVAX above the key $28.7 resistance level. Breaking and reclaiming this mark as support would confirm a trend reversal, signaling the start of a potential recovery rally. A successful breakout above $28.7 could attract more buyers and lead to a move into higher price levels. However, selling pressure remains a significant risk for AVAX. If the price loses the $23 support level, the bearish trend that has dominated since mid-December could continue. A breakdown below this range would likely take AVAX into lower demand zones, with $20 being the next critical support level.

Cardano has just implemented the Plomin hard fork, transitioning to full decentralized governance and empowering ADA holders with voting rights on critical matters. At the same time, DOGE is drawing attention with substantial whale buys—750 million tokens recently—and its addition to a new Grayscale trust fuels discussions on its future potential. As ADA and DOGE advance their ecosystems, Web3Bay is transforming the e-commerce landscape. Unlike traditional models like Amazon, which dictates fees and policies, Web3Bay operates as a web3 crypto marketplace where community members set the rules. Smart contracts eliminate intermediaries, staking rewards consumers, and DAO governance gives control back to the users. As the sphere of crypto shopping grows, Web3Bay is at the forefront. Web3Bay Revolutionizes E-Commerce: $1.17M Presale & a New Era of Blockchain Marketplace Amazon may dominate with strict control over pricing, fees, and policies, but Web3Bay is turning things around. This web3 crypto marketplace empowers its users with decentralized governance, allowing buyers and sellers to set their own transaction terms independently. Smart contracts take over where third-party systems left off, promoting trustless, transparent dealings. Users benefit from reduced fees and direct earnings, marking a significant shift from traditional e-commerce platforms that profit at the merchants’ expense. Web3Bay is not just an idea—it’s a thriving marketplace with a presale already topping $1.17 million. More than 300 million 3BAY tokens have been sold at a current price of $0.004562625. With its DAO structure, Web3Bay enables community voting on important updates and policies. The platform not only offers a place to trade but also rewards buyers through staking options that provide passive income during transactions. Early participants in Web3Bay may find significant long-term advantages as the platform grows. As more people adopt cryptocurrencies, Web3Bay is poised to become the preferred decentralized shopping destination. With the rising interest in Cardano’s ADA and a growing focus on decentralization across various sectors, Web3Bay is leveraging these principles to redefine online shopping, benefiting users over corporations. The landscape of e-commerce is evolving, and Web3Bay is leading the change. ADA Price Outlook: Major Upgrades Propel Cardano Forward Cardano’s recent Plomin hard fork marks a significant leap towards complete decentralization. This update grants ADA holders the ability to vote on protocol changes and treasury allocations. As a result, Cardano edges closer to a fully community-driven blockchain, solidifying its presence in the cryptocurrency world. With a focus on decentralized governance, Cardano is showcasing its dedication to lasting sustainability and ongoing innovation. Currently, the ADA price hovers around $0.71, supported strongly by technical indicators at crucial levels. Moreover, institutional interest is climbing—Swedish company Virtune has just introduced a staked Cardano ETP on Nasdaq Helsinki, providing 2% staking rewards. As Cardano evolves, its drive towards decentralization and growing real-world use could spur further increases. DOGE Crypto Builds Momentum as Whales Increase Holdings Big investors are actively acquiring 750 million DOGE crypto amid recent price lows, indicating a robust confidence in Dogecoin’s prospects, particularly as it attracts more institutional players. The introduction of Grayscale’s Dogecoin Trust offers investors a formal avenue to engage with DOGE, enhancing its legitimacy and stirring more speculation on its broader acceptance. DOGE is trading at approximately $0.2493, maintaining a stable trajectory despite market oscillations. With ADA also capturing interest following Cardano’s updates, both meme coins and utility-centric tokens are drawing attention. As Dogecoin widens its footprint in mainstream finance, backed by a strong community and enhanced adoption, it is poised to maintain its growth. A Closer Look Cardano’s transition to fully decentralized governance represents a pivotal change, placing more power into the community’s hands. With the ADA price remaining robust and new institutional-grade staked ETPs emerging, Cardano’s outlook is bright. Concurrently, DOGE crypto witnesses substantial whale interest, and its integration into Grayscale’s trust lends it additional authenticity. As these cryptocurrencies enhance their ecosystems, Web3Bay challenges conventional e-commerce practices. Unlike Amazon, this web3 crypto marketplace empowers buyers and sellers to dictate terms, cuts out intermediaries, and lowers costs.

However, data shows a longer timeframe for this to be achieved. Meanwhile, savvy investors are turning their attention to a new horizon, with one expert spotlighting PropiChain (PCHAIN) , an AI altcoin, as a potential game-changer, forecasting gains that could reach a staggering 40,000%. Shiba Inu Price Faces Pressure as Whale Exodus Raises Concerns The recent decline in Shiba Inu whale activity is raising red flags for investors, as large transactions have plummeted by 85%, indicating a significant shift in market behavior. Historically, whales play a crucial role in maintaining liquidity and influencing the Shiba Inu price action, but with inflows dropping by over 91% and major holders offloading 1.13 trillion SHIB in a single day, the market is seeing increased volatility. This exodus coincides with the Shiba Inu price decline from its November high of $0.000033 to the current $0.000016 level, suggesting waning confidence among large holders. While SHIB’s RSI at 37.38 signals that it is approaching oversold territory, resistance at $0.000018 remains a major hurdle. Without renewed accumulation, further downside pressure could push the Shiba Inu price toward the $0.000015 support zone. PropiChain (PCHAIN): The AI-Powered Altcoin Set to Improve Real Estate Investing The global real estate sector, valued at over $300 trillion, has long struggled with inefficiencies, fraud, and restricted access. PropiChain (PCHAIN) is transforming the industry, using blockchain and AI to eliminate these issues while rivaling the Shiba Inu price movement. One of its key features is its ability to fractionalize high-value properties, a game-changer in an industry traditionally dominated by those who can afford entire properties. With PropiChain, investors can acquire fractions of prime real estate assets, allowing for greater diversification and improved liquidity in a sector notorious for being illiquid. Beyond ownership, the platform provides an easy exit strategy for investors, allowing them to trade their tokens in a seamless marketplace. This eliminates the delays and complexity associated with conventional real estate transactions, enhancing liquidity for both individual and institutional players. PropiChain’s AI integration further elevates its impact by leveraging predictive analytics. The platform provides real-time, data-driven insights into property valuation, market trends, and investment opportunities. PCHAIN’s AI and ML algorithms analyze historical sales data and economic indicators to generate accurate property valuations, ensuring smarter investment decisions. Transactions are also automated through AI-driven smart contracts, allowing investors to set predefined conditions, such as purchasing a property once a specific price is met. This automation optimizes market conditions, reduces errors, and streamlines the transaction process. Security remains a top priority for PropiChain, with its decentralized ledger, “Title Contract,” ensuring transparency in all transactions. Each property transfer, lease agreement, and financial transaction is recorded immutably on the blockchain, preventing fraud and providing a verifiable ownership history. PCHAIN has completed an in-depth smart contract audit conducted by BlockAudit , a highly reputable blockchain security firm known for its rigorous audits. The audit assessed PropiChain’s smart contracts for vulnerabilities, ensuring that the platform’s code is secure, resistant to exploits, and operates as intended. PropiChain’s official listing on CoinMarketCap provides further transparency, allowing investors to track real-time market data, liquidity, and trading volume. PropiChain’s ambitions extend beyond traditional real estate, positioning itself as a leader in metaverse property assessment. The platform seamlessly integrates with virtual real estate markets, offering users opportunities to explore and invest in digital properties within the Propiverse. Investors can take 3D virtual property tours, interact with assets, and acquire metaverse-backed real estate, creating new investment avenues while enhancing user experience. This expansion into digital real estate allows global investors to evaluate properties remotely, redefining accessibility. PropiChain’s Token Presale: A Gateway to High Returns The PropiChain token presale has already generated significant interest, exceeding initial fundraising goals. The first phase saw over $2.9 million raised, with tokens initially priced at $0.004 each. Currently in its second stage, PCHAIN is available at $0.011 per token, with prices expected to rise to $0.023 in the final presale stage before its official listing at $0.032. This progressive increase reflects the growing investor demand and confidence in the project. Early investors stand to benefit the most, with projections indicating a potential 40,000% ROI by Q1 2025. A $1,000 investment at presale prices could see exponential growth, potentially reaching $400,000 upon public release, mirroring the price movement of Shiba Inu during its 2021 surge. As the presale advances, opportunities to acquire PCHAIN tokens at these favorable rates become increasingly limited. Interested investors can participate by registering on the official PropiChain website, selecting their investment amount, and completing their purchase through supported payment methods. Join now.

According to a new Robinhood investment report , the trading app giant saw a 200% year-over-year increase in transaction-based revenues, largely due to crypto. “Total net revenues increased 115% year-over-year to $1.01 billion. Transaction-based revenues increased over 200% year-over-year to $672 million, primarily driven by cryptocurrencies revenue of $358 million, up over 700%, options revenue of $222 million, up 83%, and equities revenue of $61 million, up 144%. Net interest revenues increased 25% year-over-year to $296 million, primarily driven by growth in interest-earning assets, partially offset by a lower federal funds rate. Other revenues increased 31% year-over-year to $46 million, primarily due to increased Gold subscription revenues.” Source: Reuters According to a Reuters report , Robinhood’s latest advance into crypto solidifies the trading app as a top rival for the leading US-based crypto exchange Coinbase. Says Paul Marino, Chief Revenue Officer at Themes ETFs (exchange-traded funds), of Robinhood’s success. “The fact that Robinhood had such a surge in revenues across its entire platform is more than just an appetite for risk in the marketplace – it’s also a testament to the adoption of its platform and the fact that the next generation of traders prefer what Robinhood is offering versus competitors.” Coinbase is on schedule to release its own quarterly earnings report later today.

Hyperliquid was last changing hands around $26 per coin, up nearly 9x since its late-November launch. Over the same time period, ETH is down around 25% and Solana is down around 20%. HYPE is the native token of HyperEVM, the innovative layer-1 blockchain that now underpins the Hyperliquid trading protocol. Whilst some are surprised by HYPE’s resilience despite the struggles of the broader crypto market, they shouldn’t be. Really is absurd how immune Hyperliquid is to any market volatility or bleed. $HYPE pic.twitter.com/pS4pMncQRd — McKenna (@Crypto_McKenna) February 13, 2025 Since launching its layer-1 blockchain, Hyperliquid has seen a surge of adoption and usage. Per Messari, Hyperliquid’s trading volumes have surged more than 4x. Hyperliquid’s monthly trading volumes up more than 4x since October Hyperliquid. pic.twitter.com/dFDPqet2lf — Messari (@MessariCrypto) February 7, 2025 HYPE was also the largest crypto airdrop in history and the coin has gained widespread praise for its community (rather than VC) first allocation. One analyst on X noted that HYPE is allocated 69.9% to the community, compared to an average of 36.1% for other networks. Hyperliquid allocated 69.9% of supply to the community, compared to an average of 36.1% for other networks. pic.twitter.com/maVy6fkOOm — Nick G (@NickDGarcia) February 12, 2025 A community-first allocation has likely directly contributed to Hyperliquid’s ground-up adoption, and its growth prospects moving forward look good. Where Next for Hyperliquid? As HYPE crawls higher to probe for a retest of its late-January highs, traders are wondering where the crypto might be headed next. HYPE continues to trade to the north of key short-term moving averages and in a modest uptrend. Macro tailwinds ( such as this week’s hot US inflation data ) continue to keep the broader market in check, but the Hyperliquid price could very well test $28 soon and mount a renewed push toward record high above $35. However, its next major surge may have to wait until broader alt-coin market conditions improve. Tight US financial conditions (US 10-year yields remain elevated around 4.5%) suggest a massive surge like that of 2017 or 2021 is unlikely this year. However, financial conditions aside, there are a lot of bullish events happening for crypto right now as the Trump administration implements its pro-crypto policies. A bitcoin strategic reserve could be coming, as well as a swathe of pro-crypto market legislation that could inject massive liquidity and demand into the space. And as an already established leader, the Hyperliquid price could be set to surge. Its fully diluted valuation of just under $26 billion suggests plenty of room for further upside in the coming years, even if 2025 is a bit of a grind. Could Hyperliquid Overtake Solana? Recent price outperformance has some analysts wondering whether HYPE might someday be able to overtake Solana. After all, the main Solana use case has been for (meme coin) trading, and Hyperliquid is arguably a far superior trading platform. However, while HYPE has shown promising growth with its innovative approach to blockchain technology and community engagement, it still lacks the established developer ecosystem and institutional support that Solana enjoys. Furthermore, even though HYPE might capture significant market interest, Solana’s lead in transaction speed, lower costs, and existing network effects create a high barrier for HYPE to surpass it in market dominance. Best Wallet – A Better Alternative to Consider? Hyperliquid has massive upside potential in the years ahead, but for those looking for even faster gains, and exciting new project called Best Wallet (BEST) could be an even better bet. With over $9 million already raised in just a few months, Best Wallet’s presale is off to a flying start. That strong momentum should come as no surprise given that Best Wallet non-custodial wallet has already amassed over 250,000 users. 250K+ traders are locking in their edge with Best Wallet.

Qubetics’ presale is approaching $13M, proving it’s one of the hottest crypto investments right now with its AI-powered Web3 ecosystem and potential 13525% ROI. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) is eyeing a breakout past $300, as its developer adoption and NFT ecosystem continue to expand. And let’s not forget Algorand (ALGO), which just launched a real-time staking model, shaking up the passive income game for investors. With Qubetics’ presale stages closing fast, Solana’s price gaining momentum, and Algorand’s staking innovation attracting attention, these cryptos are positioning themselves for short-term gains and long-term growth. But which one should you bet on? Let’s dive in. Qubetics: The Web3 Aggregator Changing the Game with a Decentralized VPN Qubetics is not just another blockchain project—it’s a Web3 aggregation powerhouse that unifies multiple networks under a single, interoperable ecosystem. One of its most revolutionary applications is its Decentralized VPN (dVPN) , a privacy-focused, censorship-resistant alternative to traditional VPNs. Right now, millions rely on centralized VPN providers like NordVPN and ExpressVPN for online privacy. But here’s the issue: these companies control user data, and in many cases, they’re legally required to hand over browsing activity to governments. Qubetics’ Decentralized VPN flips the script by offering a peer-to-peer, blockchain-based solution that: Eliminates centralized control, meaning no one entity can track, censor, or restrict your access. Uses a tokenized bandwidth-sharing system, rewarding users who share their unused bandwidth with TICS tokens. Protects against surveillance and censorship, making it ideal for users in regions with restricted internet access. For example, imagine a journalist in China trying to bypass the Great Firewall. Traditional VPNs are often blocked, but Qubetics’ dVPN operates on a decentralized network, making it nearly impossible to shut down. The same applies to crypto traders in restrictive countries, who need secure, anonymous internet access. With data privacy becoming a global concern, Qubetics’ dVPN is positioned to disrupt the $44B VPN market, making TICS one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term and long-term gains. Qubetics Presale: The Clock is Ticking on This 100x Opportunity! Let’s talk numbers—because Qubetics’ presale isn’t just growing, it’s exploding: Presale Raised: $12.6M+ Current Price: $0.0733 per TICS Total Coins Sold: 470M+ Holders: 19,700+ And here’s the kicker: each presale stage lasts just 7 days, with a 10% price increase every Sunday at 12 AM. Now, let’s get real about potential returns. A $1,000 investment at the start of the presale would already be worth $3,406 today. But post-mainnet launch, the gains could be life-changing: $TICS at $1 → 1,262.56% ROI $TICS at $10 → 13,525.66% ROI $TICS at $15 → 20,338.49% ROI With Qubetics’ mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025, time is running out to join the Qubetics presale before the next price increase. Solana: The Blockchain Powerhouse Gearing Up for a $300 Breakout Solana (SOL) has been one of the best-performing altcoins in the past year, and now, it’s flirting with the $300 resistance level. According to Solana Labs, the network has seen a massive influx of developer activity, leading some analysts to believe that Solana could eventually become a trillion-dollar asset. One of Solana’s biggest advantages is its high-speed, low-cost transactions. While Ethereum struggles with high gas fees, Solana offers an alternative that can process thousands of transactions per second for just a few cents. The recent surge in Solana’s ecosystem can be attributed to: Growing adoption of Solana-based NFTs Institutional investors showing renewed interest in SOL Upcoming protocol upgrades to enhance network efficiency With Solana eyeing a potential breakout past $300, it’s one of the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term gains, especially if the market continues its bullish momentum. Algorand: Revolutionizing Passive Income with Real-Time Staking While most blockchains require users to lock up their assets for months to earn staking rewards, Algorand (ALGO) is flipping the script with its real-time staking model. This innovation allows users to earn passive income instantly, without waiting for staking periods to end. Algorand’s new staking system has several key benefits: Instant payouts, allowing users to earn rewards without delays. No lock-up periods, meaning you can stake and unstake at any time. More flexibility for traders, who can earn rewards while still being able to move funds around. With this groundbreaking staking mechanism, Algorand is attracting a new wave of investors looking for secure, high-yield passive income options. And with staking being a major driver of token adoption, ALGO’s price could see short-term gains as demand increases. Final Thoughts: Which Altcoin Offers the Best Short-Term Gains? With so many hot crypto investments right now, here’s how things stack up: Qubetics (TICS) is the top pick for short-term and long-term growth, with its $13M presale, decentralized VPN, and massive 100x potential. Solana (SOL) is approaching a critical breakout level at $300, making it a strong play for traders looking for quick gains. Algorand (ALGO) is revolutionizing staking rewards, attracting new investors looking for passive income opportunities. If you’re looking for the best altcoins to buy and hold for short term , Qubetics is the standout. With presale prices increasing weekly and the mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, now is the time to join the Qubetics presale before the next price hike. Are you in?

40296412,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=674117,1739488527,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40296412.jpeg,Deutsche Bank-Backed Taurus unveils Solana-based tokenization platform for institutional clients,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/taurus-unveils-solana-based-tokenization/,"Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest financial institution, has partnered with Swiss crypto company Taurus and launched a Solana-based TDX marketplace. The platform is licensed to hold, manage, and stake cryptocurrencies as well as tokenized financial assets for banks, financial institutions, and enterprises. Deutsche Bank’s alliance with Taurus was part of a $65 million Series B funding round, to which key players such as Credit Suisse, Arab Bank Switzerland, and Pictet Group contributed significantly. Taurus integrates Solana for RWA tokenization Jurgen Hofbauer, head of global strategic partnerships at Taurus, noted that the integration between Taurus and Solana stemmed from the demand for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization solutions. He said that the partnership would allow banking and enterprise clients to tokenize their assets, such as equity, debt, funds, CBDCs, structured products, and tokenized deposits at lower costs and simpler processes. Taurus provides enterprise-grade infrastructure to issue cryptocurrency, manage custody, and trade tokenized assets, cryptos, and NFTs. Deutsche Bank has shown interest in crypto for years, and in June 2023, they took a bold step by applying for a digital asset custody license from Germany’s financial regulatory body, BaFin. Alongside institutional clients, retail users can create an account with Taurus and actively participate in capital raises. They can also securely trade digital assets and tokenized securities in compliance with company regulations. Taurus stated that companies can now access primary and secondary markets that serve both retail and professional investors and improve the liquidity of their digital securities. They can also develop their very own trading segments and custom liquidity through auction-based trading. Taurus entices new issuers searching for a trading venue Taurus released a list of new issuers opting for its service as a preferred platform for trading their digital securities. Some popular names include Investis Group, Qoqa, Teylor, Swissroc, la Mobiliere, and SCCF. TDX Head of Product Yann Isola said that Taurus thinks that private markets 2.0 will be digitalized, making a huge difference in buying private security. He is sure that his assumptions are correct, as the demand for real-world asset (RWA) tokenization is also the fastest-growing market for digital assets. Meanwhile, Solana has been gaining momentum in the RWA sector, attracting high-profile institutions that are looking to bring traditional financial products on-chain. Franklin Templeton, a leading global asset manager, brought its $594 million Government Money Market Fund (FOBXX) to Solana just yesterday.

40297374,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=674272,1739488855,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/40297374.jpeg,Baidu to offer Ernie Bot for free amid DeepSeek challenge,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/baidu-to-offer-ernie-bot-for-free/,"Chinese tech firm Baidu said it would offer access to its flagship artificial intelligence chatbot, Ernie Bot, for free starting April 1. The chatbot, first released just a few months after OpenAI’s ChatGPT, will be available for free to all users across mobile and desktop platforms, the company announced on Thursday, as reported by Reuters . Baidu cited reduced costs and improved technology Baidu said the decision to offer Ernie Bot for free is due to reductions in “inference costs” – basically the costs involved in training large language models (LLMs), including computing power, data storage, and energy use. The Beijing-based company also announced that a new “Deep Search” function, with “enhanced capabilities in thinking, planning, and tool calling” will also be released for free on April 1. After the news, shares of Baidu rose as much as 5.7% in Hong Kong trading on Thursday, according to Google Finance. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has reached a high of HK$119 and low of HK$74. Per Baidu’s data, Ernie Bot had reached a user base of around 430 million users as of November 2024. The chatbot was an early leader in China’s AI industry but it is now facing increasing competition from cheaper and more advanced rivals such as DeepSeek, which provides free AI chatbot services. The Chinese startup recently dropped new models and also claimed the superiority of its models in a technical report. DeepSeek said its model outclassed rivals from OpenAI and Stability AI on rankings for image generation using text prompts. On Wednesday, The Information reported that Baidu was failing to meet Apple’s standards to bring AI to Chinese iPhones. The iPhone maker was reportedly considering working with other firms like Alibaba, it said. And then on Thursday, Alibaba chairman Joe Tsai confirmed during a conference in Dubai that the e-commerce giant is working with Apple. Baidu faces stiff competition Baidu was one of China’s first tech firms to delve deep into the AI sector after OpenAI released its ChatGPT in November 2022. Released in March 2023 , Baidu’s Ernie Bot was up until last month seen as the closest rival to ChatGPT. Baidu has reportedly claimed that its latest version Ernie 4.0 matches OpenAI’s GPT-4 capabilities. However, it has not been rosy for Baidu. According to Asia Financial , one of the tech giant’s biggest challenges has been to achieve widespread adoption in China for the chatbot, although it reportedly handled 1.5 billion daily user queries and interactions. Data from AI product tracker Aicpb.com shows that in terms of user adoption, Baidu’s offerings have been lagging behind domestic competitors like ByteDance’s Doubao chatbot and the latest competitor DeepSeek. According to Asia Financial, the search engine giant’s problems also reflect the intense rivalry within the AI sector in China. The world witnessed a price war last year as the firm and its key competitors Alibaba and ByteDance significantly cut prices of LLMs they use to support generative AI products. Baidu made its Ernie Speed and Ernie Lite free for all business users at that time. In November last year, Baidu revealed that it was shifting its focus to the commercialization of LLM applications. One of its products I-RAG is a text-to-image technology that uses Baidu’s search capabilities to tackle the AI “hallucination” problems. The company also announced the launch of Miaoda, a tool that utilizes its LLM capabilities to generate code and allow users to develop software applications without extensive coding expertise. According to a CNBC report earlier this week, Baidu revealed it is also planning to introduce the next iteration of Ernie Bot in the second half of this year. Citing sources familiar with the matter, the report further indicates that the latest model, Ernie 5, will feature multimodal capabilities which allow it to process and convert between different formats including text, images, audio, and videos.

The buybacks will start from Monday, February 17, and will aim to build a JUP reserve for additional incentives. JUP tokens may get support from the first buybacks, starting Monday, February 17. The Jupiter DEX will use the proceeds from trading fees to build a JUP treasury, which will be locked for three years, per the announcement . we want more more jup. so buybacks start on monday. 50% of all protocol fees will go towards buying $JUP and locking it for 3 years. J4J — Jupiter (🐱, 🐐) (@JupiterExchange) February 13, 2025 The buybacks offset the recent Jupuary airdrop, which led to selling pressure. The buybacks will be announced through a dashboard coming next week. The buybacks will be scheduled at every hour, aiming to bring back as much JUP as possible for a vesting period of three years. The buyback decision comes after the Catstanbul event that burned 3B JUP, reducing the total supply to 7B tokens. Even the burn was not enough to push JUP from its lows, as it was still absorbing selling from the Jupuary airdrop. Jupiter will aggregate fees from all its services and activities, storing all proceeds in a wallet. The fees may be in the form of various tokens, as balances will be transparently posted through the public address. The Jupiter service will include fees from its perpetual futures trades, DCA service, and other routing tools. From the total fees, 50% will be swapped into SOL and USDC for development activities, explained Jupiter cofounder @sssionggg . The rest of the funds will be used for the JUP buybacks, with all purchases going through Jupiter’s own routing. The USDC and SOL will be kept in the team’s multisig wallet, while JUP will be locked in a new vault, the Litter Box, and kept for three years. Jupiter fees got a boost in February Jupiter achieved over $500K in fees for the past 24 hours, ranking 14th among Solana apps and protocols. For the past month, Jupiter DEX fees reached a total of $4.8M. The recent heightened activity saw Jupiter fees rally in February, rising far above their baseline. The current activity may allow the buying of up to $250K in JUP tokens. Currently, all JUP trading is at over $260M in 24 hours, of which $37M is concentrated on Binance. The buying will have a somewhat limited effect on the price, but over time, it may start to make a dent in circulating JUP. The pace of buybacks may vary, as Jupiter may produce a lower or higher level of daily fees. For Jupiter DEX, the spike in swaps happened after January 20, reflecting the launch of Official Trump (TRUMP) and other celebrity tokens. Jupiter total swaps remained higher than the previous baseline. The rally at the beginning of 2025 finally lifted Jupiter activity, after remaining relatively low during the expansion at the end of 2024. Jupiter fees got a boost in February, after the new wave of official celebrity tokens launching on Solana in the past three weeks. | Source: DeFi Llama Jupiter peaked at over 190K daily users on January 21. Currently, swaps and fees remain elevated, despite registering under 20K daily users . The decision for the buyback arrives after Jupiter posted some of its biggest fee gains in history, following peak Solana activity in the past few weeks. The DEX and the aggregator service were among the most widely used on Solana for optimal routing and faster swaps. Following the news, JUP briefly spiked to $0.86, then retreated to $0.83. The token is at the lower end of its three-month range, despite the protocol’s peak performance. JUP has 2.63B tokens in circulation, out of a total supply of 10B. Most JUP is habitually held in reserves and in various forms of staking. The token is expected to break out soon, recovering from the selling pressure of Jupuary tokens. JUP fell from a local peak at $1.22, as new recipients traded in 67% of the newly received tokens. Jupuary aimed to spread JUP to a wider audience, though most turned into sellers. In an optimistic scenario, the buyback would lock over 9% of the JUP supply. The large-scale token burn and the buybacks also face the challenge of mitigating token unlocks. Fewer than 20% of JUP are unlocked, expecting a gradual increase in the available supply. The team’s early allocation and other holdings will start getting unlocked in H2, potentially putting more pressure on the market.

According to a post on X , this updated version will change the NFT market with several new features. OS2 offers a lower marketplace fee, an airdrop of its new SEA token, and adds support for 14 new blockchains. OpenSea OS2 Platform Comes With Lots of Benefits It is worth noting that OpenSea will significantly reduce marketplace fees to just 0.5%. This shift helps make the platform more appealing for creators and collectors by offering a cheaper way to buy, sell, and trade NFTs. Additionally, users will no longer pay swap fees, so they can complete transactions without any extra costs when swapping assets in the NFT market. Another notable improvement in OS2 is the addition of 14 new blockchains, including Sony’s Sonieum and Bored Ape’s Apechain. This gives users more options in picking the blockchain that fits their needs and creating chances for cross-chain compatibility. Furthermore, these new blockchains will work smoothly with the platform, improving the user experience and expanding NFTs available to everyone. Additionally, OpenSea affirmed that SEA token airdrop is coming soon, majorly for United States users. Although an exact date and time haven’t been revealed, this token will be important for the OS2 ecosystem. SEA token will provide new benefits and governance options as the platform develops. Meanwhile, OpenSea will reward its users with this airdrop to show its commitment to the community. OpenSea Sparks Airdrop Buzz Recall that in December 2024, OpenSea sparked excitement and speculation following its registration in the Cayman Islands . Pseudonymous researcher Waleswoosh, affiliated with the Azuki NFT collection, shared OpenSea’s official registration in the Cayman Islands with a screenshot. As such, the news stirred up speculations with the NFT community about an impending token launch and airdrop. Likewise, the news followed OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer’s announcement about the platform revival in November 2024. He promised a revamped version would launch in December but did not provide details. Since then, speculation about a token launch has grown. Many users wonder if this move signals a significant shift for OpenSea and its plans. OpenSea Unveils Seaport 1.6 for Next-Gen NFT Markets Meanwhile, OpenSea collaborated with the Seaport Working Group to release Seaport 1.6 , marking a new era for the NFT marketplace with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem. According to the company, Seaport 1.6 introduced a new feature called Seaport Hooks. Similar to Uniswap v4 Hooks, the Seaport Hook enables developers to create applications that significantly enhance NFTs’ liquidity and utility. Although Seaport serves as a protocol for facilitating peer-to-peer sales of on-chain items, the introduction of Seaport Hooks added a new dimension to NFT governance and functionality.

Qualified U.S. investors will have broad, balanced exposure to the crypto market through the instrument. It is the first approved of several applicants for similar ETFs. The Nasdaq Crypto Index follows nine cryptocurrencies that are weighted according to their market capitalizations. The index represents 75% of the market capitalization of all eligible assets and would add more cryptocurrencies to maintain that level, if necessary. A minimum investment of $100,000 is required. The ETF will have a limited start The ETF (ticker NCIQ) will initially only contain Bitcoin and Ether and will expand the mixture as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approves more cryptos for listing. BTC and ETH currently make up 74.81% and 11.51% of the index, respectively. The index is passively managed and rebalanced quarterly. Besides BTC and ETH, the other cryptocurrencies currently on the index, in proportional order, are Ripple (XRP), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), Litecoin (LTC), Avalanche (AVAX) and Uniswap (UNI). NCIQ was listed at $4,827.98 per share at the time of writing, down 1.37% from the previous day. A mixed-crypto ETF is a popular product Brazil-based Hashdex and Nasdaq collaborated on the creation of the index in 2021, and similar products with the full spectrum of listed cryptos are available in several countries. The Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index Europe ETP has amassed over $500 million. The exchange-traded product (ETP) is traded on the Swiss SIX exchange, Deutsche Börse Xetra, Euronext Paris, and Euronext Amsterdam. The Brazilian Stock Exchange B3 lists a Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index ETP. It is listed in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands as well.

Users can apply Stars to transform a gift into an NFT, boosting its value and making it transferable on-chain. TON chain is growing its NFT activity, almost catching up with Bitcoin ordinals. The activity is based on Telegram gifts, which start out as images but can be minted as NFT. TON is a relatively new hub for NFT and is still niche compared to more established chains. However, TON NFT markets are in their rapid expansion chain, while older networks retain a fraction of their volumes. In the past 24 hours, TON showed its ability to carry an active NFT market . Performance may vary, but the consensus is TON is just starting out with a new wave of NFT. The emergence of a new NFT activity and the minting of collectibles may offset the lowered traffic on TON chain . TON expanded its NFT activity after establishing even closer connections to Telegram. The chat app added Gifts and a new in-app asset, Stars. A gift can still be traded or sent out, but Stars allow it to be minted into an NFT and traded on-chain. Stars can reach all Telegram users, especially those interacting with mini apps. Telegram estimates up to 400M users seek out mini apps and games. Telegram stars make use of the TON blockchain but are also compatible with the Apple Store and Google Appstore. The assets can support creators, make in-app purchases, and are used to trade Gifts as NFT. Upgrading a gift costs a relatively small amount of Stars, which is used to cover network fees. Stars can be bought at $0.016, with fees for purchasing through app stores. Later, the NFT can appreciate and trade on the secondary market. The recent NFT boom may revive interest in TON chain. The native TON token lost some of its positions during the latest market correction, sliding to $3.74. TON chain lost the hype from tap-to-earn games, its meme market was small compared to other chains, and the DeFi sector remained small. The recent digital gift boom and a focus on the Telegram chat app are seen as a source of growth. TON chain also aims to become more transparent and tap the US market. Collectible gifts come with unique features TON chain NFT starts out as regular Telegram gifts, and can be upgraded to collectible through stars. The new collectible item unlocks new characteristics, such as background color, icon, and serial number. There are more than 20 gifts that have additional art and features created, allowing for up to 1,400 unique combinations when minting. TON chain avoided the approach of generating collections, instead seeking out organic growth for its items, as they are used inside the chat app. The organic growth meant gifts and collectibles expanded with activity on Telegram. Gifts took about three months to turn into an NFT sensation and increase their volumes. More than 20M gifts have been minted as collectibles as of January 2025, with more created among the most popular gifts. NFT mints accelerated in the past three months, tapping the Telegram gifts trend. | Source: TON stat GetGems and MarketApp are currently the most active TON NFT markets, reporting hundreds of users each day. Fragment was the most active marketplace in the last 24 hours, carrying $374.8K in sales. The Fragment marketplace also expanded its volumes by 70% in the past 24 hours, as the TON chain NFT usage was just starting out. Anonymous Telegram numbers and Telegram usernames are among the most active collections with the biggest number of holders. TON chain and Telegram aim to break out and reach a mass audience while offering seamless on-chain access. To that end, Telegram will only use TON chain and its native assets, removing other crypto coins and tokens as payments. The TON chain NFT ecosystem is mostly focused on fun and in-chat use cases. As a result, most NFT traded at a low price, with 64 TON for the most expensive and 0.2 TON on average. The goal of the NFT is not high-value collections, but daily turnover and utility. The collectibles can also be sent as minted, letting the end user in the chat unwrap the gift and see the unique features.

Dogecoin’s price is at $0.2587, struggling to maintain essential support as large holders continue to buy. On the other hand, Cardano sees more action from large investors, moving millions of tokens even after a 23% price fall. Analysts think it might recover, yet the future is uncertain. As meme coins and key altcoins face market shifts, the focus is shifting towards Web3 in ecommerce, which shows promise for substantial growth. Web3Bay’s presale is attracting early investors aiming for substantial gains by 2025. This platform integrates blockchain into online shopping, enabling users to manage their transactions and rewards through tokens. With initial pricing and growing interest, Web3Bay is emerging as a potentially lucrative opportunity ahead of its official launch. Why Web3Bay’s Presale Is Generating Buzz Now? Web3Bay is shaping up to be a pivotal player in online shopping by integrating Web3 into ecommerce through a decentralized market. It cuts out intermediaries, reduces fees, and grants buyers and sellers direct control. With blockchain-based transactions and community-led governance, Web3Bay offers a new shopping model where users have full control over their data and finances. As cryptocurrency becomes more mainstream, such platforms are increasingly in demand. Currently, Web3Bay’s presale is offering early participants a chance to invest before the full rollout. The presale has already accumulated over $1.17 million, selling more than 300 million tokens at a rate of $0.004562625 each. With a predicted presale ROI of 6430%, early investors could see significant advantages. Additionally, Web3Bay provides referral bonuses, rewarding users for bringing new investors. With the fluctuating predictions for major cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, some investors are turning their focus to projects with solid long-term prospects. Web3Bay merges ecommerce and blockchain, providing genuine token utility. As traditional markets keep charging high fees and controlling transactions, Web3Bay’s model is appealing to those seeking a more decentralized option. With presale prices remaining low, the opportunity to invest before it spikes is closing fast. Dogecoin Prediction: What’s Next for DOGE? Dogecoin’s price is currently around $0.2587, facing difficulties in maintaining key support levels after a recent decrease. The meme coin has weakened, dropping below its 50-day and 100-day EMAs. Despite this, there is notable whale activity, with significant holders buying up nearly 750 million DOGE during this low. This shows some confidence from large investors, yet the possibility of a price recovery will depend on overall market conditions and investor interest. A significant development is the launch of Grayscale’s Dogecoin Trust, aiming to bring institutional investors to DOGE. This might boost its adoption; however, technical signs advise caution as DOGE hovers around a vital support area. The future of Dogecoin is still up in the air, with experts looking for signs of either a price surge or further declines. If buying interest increases, DOGE may approach new resistance levels, but currently, the market direction is unclear. ADA Whale Activity: Will Cardano Bounce Back from Its Recent Decline? Cardano is under pressure following a 23% fall in price, yet ADA whale activity indicates that major investors remain active. These large holders are moving millions of ADA, raising hopes for a potential recovery. ADA is now close to its 200-day moving average, with its RSI at its lowest since last October, suggesting the asset might be undervalued. Should the momentum shift, a price recovery could be on the horizon, though the market’s future is still uncertain. Furthermore, Swedish asset manager Virtune has introduced Cardano ETPs on Nasdaq Helsinki, increasing institutional access to ADA. Some analysts view this positively, although caution prevails. Unlike the volatile Dogecoin, ADA’s future movements will rely on its ability to recover important technical levels and attract fresh investment. The Bottom Line Both Dogecoin and ADA are showing mixed signals. DOGE is struggling to hold crucial support yet enjoys robust whale support, whereas ADA’s recent price drop has placed it in potentially undervalued territory, suggesting a chance for recovery. Both cryptocurrencies are seeing institutional interest, yet short-term outcomes are still uncertain. Therefore, some are turning their attention to Web3 in ecommerce, a sector promising real-world applications and substantial growth potential. Web3Bay’s crypto presale has already raised over $1.17 million, and with a projected ROI of 6430%, early participants are locking in their positions before the price increases. As traditional platforms continue to hike fees, Web3Bay is creating a decentralized marketplace that empowers its users. The presale period is limited, and as prices are set to rise, the current low investment threshold will soon disappear.

BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus code has fueled its presale past $194 million, offering structured incentives that ensure steady demand and reduce volatility. Unlike speculative market moves, BlockDAG ’s approach builds long-term value, making it a standout in the sector. Meanwhile, Stacks has gained traction after its founder’s $10 million investment, reinforcing trust in Bitcoin layer solutions. Injective Protocol is also experiencing a surge, with a 25% price increase and rising on-chain activity. However, BlockDAG’s strategic execution and buyer enthusiasm suggest it leads the pack. FINALCALL700 is Supercharging BlockDAG Presale BlockDAG’s FINALCALL700 bonus code is driving record-breaking momentum, pushing the presale total to $194 million with over 18.4 billion BDAG coins sold. As a result, offering a 350% bonus has fueled a surge in buyer participation, making it one of the most successful crypto presales of the year. Currently, in batch 27, BDAG is priced at $0.0248, reflecting an ROI of 2,340% since batch 1. Moreover, presale incentives like FINALCALL700 play a crucial role in buyer psychology. By doing so, BlockDAG has created a sense of urgency, attracting both retail buyers and crypto whales looking to maximize early-stage returns. Similarly, this approach mirrors successful launches like Solana and Ethereum, where early buyers saw massive gains due to well-structured presale incentives. What’s more, BlockDAG sets itself apart through strategic execution. Unlike projects that offer arbitrary airdrops, the structured presale phases and timed bonuses ensure steady demand, preventing price volatility before launch. Consequently, this method not only builds buyer confidence but also solidifies BDAG’s position as a sought-after asset. Since the FINALCALL700 bonus is expiring soon, the presale is expected to push past new milestones. As interest continues to grow, BlockDAG’s approach proves that well-planned presale incentives can drive mass adoption and long-term growth. Therefore, buyers are watching closely, knowing that early participation in a strong project can be the difference between minor gains and life-changing returns. Stacks Founder Buys $10 Million in STX Muneeb Ali, the founder of Stacks, has accumulated $10 million worth of STX tokens, reinforcing his belief in the project’s long-term potential. Notably, his significant purchase aligns with Stacks’ ongoing advancements in Bitcoin layer solutions, particularly its role in enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications on Bitcoin. As a result, this move has sparked increased investor confidence, leading to a surge in STX’s price and market interest. Furthermore, Ali’s investment suggests optimism about Stacks’ growth trajectory, especially as Bitcoin layers gain traction in the industry. His deep involvement in the ecosystem, meanwhile, highlights his commitment to expanding Stacks’ capabilities and adoption. As a key figure behind the project, his financial stake could influence broader market sentiment, attracting further investment. Injective Protocol ($INJ) Gains Momentum Injective Protocol ($INJ) is showing bullish signs, with analysts predicting a positive market reaction. Since the start of 2025, $INJ has surged by 25%, climbing from a January 1 low of $9.96 to $12.45 as of February 10. In addition, trading volume has risen by 15% in the past week, reaching approximately $45 million, reflecting growing investor confidence. Meanwhile, Binance remains a key exchange for $INJ, with the $INJ/USDT pair accounting for $30 million in daily trades, followed by $INJ/BTC at $5 million. On-chain activity has also strengthened, with active addresses increasing by 10% to 12,500 and transaction volume rising by 8% to $100 million. These metrics, therefore, highlight increasing adoption and usage, reinforcing the asset’s potential for further gains. Strategic Growth Positions BlockDAG Ahead As buyer interest intensifies, BlockDAG, Stacks, and Injective Protocol continue to gain momentum. BlockDAG’s structured presale incentives, surpassing $194 million, set it apart by maintaining demand while preventing excessive volatility. Meanwhile, Stacks benefits from its founder’s $10 million investment, reinforcing confidence in Bitcoin layer solutions. Injective Protocol’s rising trading volume and price surge highlight increasing adoption. While all three projects show promise, BlockDAG’s carefully planned execution and investor enthusiasm indicate it holds a stronger position for long-term growth. With interest growing, its presale success underscores its potential as a more stable and strategically positioned investment opportunity.

This was primarily due to a massive increase in cryptocurrency transaction fees in the current quarter, which stood at $358 million, a 491% increase from the previous quarter. The increase in crypto revenue also brought a new interest in retail investing in digital assets. Robinhood’s highest cryptocurrency trading revenue of $233M was recorded in 2021, mainly due to DOGE trading. This notional volume was established in Q4 2024, and it was 400% higher than the volumes recorded in the previous year. Robinhood expanded its offerings, adding 7 new cryptocurrencies for its users in the United States, as well as Ethereum staking in the European Union. This decision reflects its general goals of targeting a steadily expanding audience of retail and institutional investors in cryptocurrencies. Strong financial performance and market response Notably, the company reported a net income of $916 million, well above analyst expectations. This impacted the company’s stock price, leading to a 7% increase in its shares to $60 in after-hours trading after the earnings report. The shares’ value has been soaring since the beginning of 2024, registering a 360% increase. The Assets Under Custody (AUC) also grew 88% to $193 billion yearly. This was attributed to steady net deposits and higher equities and cryptocurrency valuations. In June 2024, Robinhood announced plans to acquire global crypto exchange Bitstamp, pending regulatory approvals. The acquisition is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2025, positioning Robinhood for deeper institutional market penetration. Additionally, Robinhood revealed in June 2024 that it planned to buy global crypto exchange Bitstamp, pending regulatory approvals. The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025, allowing Robinhood to penetrate the institutional markets better. Robinhood also expanded its trading products beyond cryptocurrencies. The company launched index options for all users and in-app futures trading, offering products across stocks, energy, currencies, metals, and crypto. In addition, Robinhood Legend, the desktop platform for active traders launched in October 2024, has seen the addition of nearly 30 new indicators and expanded to the crypto side. Regulatory challenges While Robinhood’s Q4 was solid financially, the company faced regulatory headwinds. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) ordered Robinhood Derivatives to suspend its sports event contracts. As a result, it decided to stop the rollout of the Pro Football Championship market that it had opened to a limited number of users. In addition, the company said it is committed to cooperating with regulators to make sure it is compliant. Robinhood’s reported performance comes amid a broader crypto market rally. Several altcoins posted major gains, while Bitcoin hit $100,000 for the first time in Q4.

As more investors enter the presale, Lightchain AI is poised to become a significant player in the upcoming wave of blockchain advancements. In this article, we delve into why these sequential buys are occurring in Lightchain AI's presale and what it signifies for blockchain's future. Reasons Behind the Sequential Purchases The series of purchases within the Lightchain AI environment is forming a distinct pattern, driven by the project's unique technological approach and market positioning.

As Solana and XRP investors observe the growing momentum behind Lightchain AI, some are opting to diversify their investment portfolios. The project's commitment to scalable, AI-powered solutions offers a compelling alternative that could capture a portion of the market. While Solana and XRP are established forces, the arrival of a technologically sophisticated competitor like Lightchain AI is expected to influence investor strategies and expand the competitive field.

As Bitcoin remains at the forefront of the DeFi landscape, innovative projects like Mutuum Finance are emerging to broaden the spectrum of opportunities. Currently in its presale stage, Mutuum Finance introduces a novel approach to decentralized lending and borrowing, allowing investors to engage in a burgeoning sector poised for further achievements in 2025. Introducing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized platform crafted to streamline lending and borrowing in the crypto realm, making these processes both simple and rewarding. It operates with two distinctive markets aimed at fulfilling varied user demands: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C market leverages automated smart contracts to securely and efficiently manage transactions, simplifying user participation. Meanwhile, the P2P market enables direct user interaction, offering enhanced flexibility and access to a wider variety of assets, including newly introduced or niche tokens. For those supplying assets, Mutuum Finance provides an avenue to earn passive income by depositing assets like USDT into liquidity pools, allowing their investments to grow over time. Borrowers can utilize their crypto assets, such as Ethereum, as collateral to obtain funds without needing to liquidate their holdings. For instance, by depositing Ethereum, a borrower can secure a portion of its value in USDT for personal or investment purposes. Now is potentially the perfect moment to invest in MUTM tokens, which are currently available at the lowest presale price of $0.01. Experts forecast that this token will increase by over 1000% upon launch, with an expected price of $0.06 or more. This projected growth is fueled by the platform's strong emphasis on utility, particularly its lending and borrowing functions, alongside the planned beta platform launch that coincides with the token release. These initiatives are anticipated to boost demand and adoption significantly, making Mutuum Finance a compelling investment prospect in the DeFi arena. Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself through its tangible benefits and a clearly outlined growth strategy. For those eager to enter the DeFi market early, MUTM offers a promising chance to invest in a project with substantial success potential. The tokenomics of Mutuum Finance are thoughtfully structured to encourage growth and reward community involvement. With a total supply of 4 billion MUTM tokens, the distribution plan ensures the platform's sustainability and attractiveness to investors. A significant share, 45.5%, is designated for the presale, providing early investors access to MUTM tokens at an attractive entry price. An additional 10% is allocated for liquidity mining and incentives, rewarding both suppliers and borrowers who actively support the platform's ecosystem. These incentives promote liquidity and engagement, which are vital for the platform's long-term success. Moreover, 10% of the tokens are reserved to foster ecosystem growth and support developer contributions, ensuring ongoing innovation and expansion. Remaining allocations are carefully distributed for partnerships, platform liquidity, and community incentives. This well-balanced token distribution not only encourages participation but also lays a solid foundation for price stability and growth, making MUTM an appealing option for investors. With a clear focus on utility and scalability, Mutuum Finance's tokenomics aim to deliver sustainable value to its users and stakeholders. Bitcoin DeFi TVL Rockets by 2,000% in 2024 Bitcoin-centric decentralized finance (DeFi) experienced an extraordinary surge in 2024, with total value locked (TVL) increasing by a staggering 2,000%. This explosive growth was spurred by significant advancements such as the introduction of Bitcoin staking platforms and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. These developments not only bolstered investor confidence but also highlighted Bitcoin's growing role beyond its traditional use as a store of value, reinforcing its standing in the DeFi sector. The rise in TVL highlights the escalating demand for Bitcoin-driven financial solutions. With projects launching innovative protocols and increased capital pouring into Bitcoin-native DeFi platforms, the network is demonstrating its ability to compete with other ecosystems like Ethereum. The blend of technological advancement, rising prices, and institutional interest positions Bitcoin DeFi as a pivotal area to monitor as we head into 2025. Bitcoin and Mutuum Finance are each shaping the future of decentralized finance in their distinct ways. Bitcoin's record-setting DeFi growth in 2024 underscores its expanding utility and investor trust, while Mutuum Finance introduces fresh opportunities with its practical lending and borrowing features. As these platforms develop, they present exciting prospects for those eager to engage in the next wave of crypto innovation.

40297862,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=695681,1739493037,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Dogecoin Breakout Coming? Analyst Identifies Key Price Level,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-breakout-key-price-level/,"In his latest technical breakdown posted on X, analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) highlighted a pivotal threshold on Dogecoin’s daily chart. According to Kevin, reclaiming the $0.28 region on a weekly close—and then showing clear follow-through—could set Dogecoin on a path toward retesting its all-time highs. He notes: “Get back above the .28 cents level on Dogecoin on a weekly close and show follow through and my thought process is we attack the highs not too long after that. I have been allocating into a spot long at .25 cents on DOGE in the Patreon via the Trading Portfolio (separate from long term bag). Ready for either outcome. Let’s send this thing higher.” When Will The Dogecoin Correction End? The chart highlights a well-known metric called the Bitcoin Bull Market Support Band, applied here to Dogecoin, which consists of the 20-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Although this indicator was originally developed for Bitcoin, many analysts extend it to altcoins to determine whether the broader trend is bullish or bearish. In Dogecoin’s current setup, this band hovers in the $0.282–$0.286 range. Price dipped below it last week and now facing a key resistance zone between $0.27 and $0.29. Related Reading: Dogecoin Ready For A $2.43 Rally? Elliott Wave Says Yes Beyond the price levels, Kevin also points to two momentum studies. On the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI), the yellow line has crossed above its accompanying moving average, suggesting that bearish pressure may be easing. The RSI hovers near 38, which is above a notable support region around 27. Notably, the yellow RSI line is now back above its pink moving average (MA) line. According to Kevin, this may be an early sign of a shift in sentiment if follow-through buying continues. Another important technical feature is the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), which is nearing a bullish crossover. The MACD line is approaching the signal line, and if this crossover is confirmed, it could generate positive momentum for Dogecoin. Kevin marks this as a “Pending Daily Bullish MACD Cross,” which, if validated, would add further credence to the bullish outlook. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holding Strong—Analyst Says $4 Rally Could Be Next In the larger scheme, the chart underscores that a firm weekly close above $0.28 is the key catalyst. This level aligns with the Bull Market Support Band, and if reclaimed decisively, could accelerate Dogecoin’s push toward mid-$0.30s or beyond, provided broader market conditions remain conducive. In another post, Kevin explained: “I have been saying it for weeks now while the rest have said its altseason. We are in a major correctional period. These periods happen in markets in case you never noticed. Crypto is very driven off the macro, especially altcoins. We want to hold these levels on Total Market Cap if we want to feel good about this market otherwise the correction can go deeper. In the mean time Chill out. Still billions in liquidity up to $111K on BTC that will be taken eventually.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.25.

The plan targets countries that enforce non-tariff trade barriers, including value-added taxes (VATs), which the administration believes create an unfair advantage for foreign businesses. The US Trade Representative’s office has been tasked with reviewing these policies to determine which countries will face retaliatory tariffs. Trump also announced that countries will not be allowed to ship goods to the US through third-party nations to bypass these tariffs. “THREE GREAT WEEKS, PERHAPS THE BEST EVER, BUT TODAY IS THE BIG ONE; RECIPROCAL TARIFFS!!!,” Trump had posted on Truth Social. Commerce Secretary to oversee tariff studies At the Oval, Trump confirmed that Howard Lutnick, his Commerce Secretary, will lead the effort to determine the tariff levels for each affected country. “We want a level playing field,” Trump said, emphasizing that the US will no longer tolerate one-sided trade deals. Lutnick expects a full report by April 1, after which tariffs will be implemented accordingly. Shortly after the announcement, Trump took to Truth Social, saying that the plan would also address foreign subsidies and nonmonetary trade barriers that disadvantage US industries. “America has helped many Countries throughout the years, at great financial cost. It is now time that these Countries remember this, and treat us fairly,” Trump wrote. The reciprocal tariffs come on the heels of Trump’s previous trade measures, including tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, along with duties on steel and aluminum imports. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico remain on hold, as both countries have agreed to step up efforts against illegal border crossings and drug trafficking. European Union and global markets react European nations are definitely next on Trump’s list. He has repeatedly criticized the US trade deficit with Europe and has called out the EU for not purchasing enough American cars and farm equipment. European leaders, though, have warned that any US tariffs will be met with retaliation. Markets responded cautiously to Trump’s reciprocal tariff plan. During the day’s session, the S&P 500 rose 1.04%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.5%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.77%, hitting session highs exactly four times. The 10-year US Treasury yield dropped nine basis points, while Australian and New Zealand bond yields also declined early Friday. The US dollar fell 0.7% against its developed-market peers, while the yen surged 1.1% in Thursday trading. The Canadian dollar hit a new high for the year, as investors speculated on how Trump’s tariff plan might affect North American trade. The timing of Trump’s signing event came just hours before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to visit the White House. India has long faced accusations of imposing restrictive trade policies on US goods, and Modi’s meeting with Trump was expected to address the issue. Whether India will seek exemptions or retaliate remains unclear.

With its presale currently active, the project presents an early chance for those interested in leveraging its lending services and vision for a fully backed stablecoin. Analysts are hopeful about its future, forecasting notable expansion for the MUTM token. Meanwhile, Cardano's research has underscored the blockchain's growing influence in solving real-world issues. Emphasizing areas such as traceability, authenticity, and sustainability, Cardano illustrates the practical application of blockchain technology in supporting global industries. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): An Overview Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that empowers users to participate as both lenders and borrowers. It offers a straightforward platform for users to deposit their crypto assets into specific liquidity pools, earn interest, and borrow against collateral. By prioritizing transparency, adaptability, and security, Mutuum Finance aims to establish a proficient ecosystem for handling digital assets. Lenders can contribute their cryptocurrencies to Mutuum’s liquidity pools, earning returns based on the utilization rate of the pool. Borrowers can tap into these funds by securing collateral that exceeds the loan amount. This overcollateralization safeguards the platform's stability and reduces risk for users. Mutuum Finance functions with two main lending frameworks: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In the P2C framework, smart contracts oversee the lending and borrowing operations automatically. Users can lend or borrow assets without needing to directly connect with someone else. This setup ensures transactions are efficient and secure, appealing to users who prefer minimal involvement. Conversely, the P2P framework enables direct interaction between users. Borrowers and lenders can negotiate terms, offering flexibility not found in the P2C market. Moreover, the P2P market supports assets not usually available in the P2C market, like memecoins or new tokens, broadening opportunities for users with particular interests. Mutuum structures its lending markets around specific liquidity pools for each supported cryptocurrency. Lenders earn interest by placing assets into these pools, obtaining mtTokens as proof of their deposits. These mtTokens automatically reflect accrued interest, streamlining the process for users. Borrowers can obtain funds from these pools by securing collateral that surpasses the loan value, ensuring overcollateralization. The platform assigns a Loan-To-Value (LTV) ratio to each asset, determining its borrowing capacity based on liquidity and volatility. Borrowers have the option to repay loans partially or entirely at any time, as long as they maintain a suitable collateral-to-debt ratio to prevent liquidation. For Lenders: A user deposits 1 ETH into a Mutuum liquidity pool and gets back 1 mtETH token. Over time, the mtETH token accumulates interest according to the pool’s utilization rate. When the user decides to redeem their mtETH after several months, they might withdraw 1.05 ETH, including the interest earned (subject to current interest rates). For Borrowers: An investor holds 2 ETH and wishes to borrow 1 ETH. They use their 2 ETH as collateral in Mutuum, ensuring the loan is overcollateralized. Upon full repayment of the loan, the borrower can reclaim their collateral. By integrating its P2C and P2P markets with strong lending and borrowing frameworks, Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself as a versatile and secure DeFi platform. This configuration not only addresses diverse user requirements but also supports a dynamic and sustainable ecosystem for ongoing growth. Cardano Study Showcases Blockchain Advancements A recent study by the Cardano Foundation has illuminated the expanding impact of blockchain technology, particularly focusing on initiatives within the Cardano ecosystem. The analysis covered over 580 projects, revealing that a majority aim to tackle real-world problems in areas like traceability, authenticity, and sustainability. Approximately 55% of these projects concentrate on authenticity, providing secure verification for identities and data, while 30% focus on traceability to create transparent records for digital and physical asset verification. This underscores Cardano's capability to address significant global issues with practical blockchain solutions. Cardano's international presence is also evident, with 70% of its projects targeting global markets. The platform’s scalability and adaptability have made it a preferred option for enterprises and developers worldwide. By supporting a wide range of applications, Cardano is driving the role of blockchain in resolving industry challenges, from ensuring supply chain transparency to promoting environmental efforts. This growth not only highlights the platform's adaptability but also its potential to effect meaningful change across multiple sectors. Reasons to Consider Investing in Mutuum Finance by 2025 Mutuum Finance presents investors with the opportunity to enter at the most affordable price during its presale phase, with MUTM tokens available for just $0.01. The project's strong emphasis on practical utilities, including its decentralized lending platform and plans for a fully collateralized stablecoin, sets it up for substantial growth. For those seeking significant returns and a promising early-stage investment, Mutuum Finance emerges as an attractive option.

The acknowledgment specifically applies to Grayscale’s product, which will convert its existing XRP Trust into a fully tradable ETF on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca. Grayscale launched its XRP Trust years ago, similar to its Bitcoin and Ethereum trusts. A conversion to an ETF would provide greater liquidity and accessibility, potentially increasing demand for XRP among traditional investors. XRP ETF filing moves to the next stage But the acknowledgment does not mean an automatic approval, nor does it guarantee that the SEC will definitely greenlight the XRP ETF in the future. But it is still a pretty big deal because the SEC, under its former chairman Gary Gensler, refused to even engage with altcoin ETF applications. Just a few months ago, Solana ETF applications were withdrawn after the SEC and Gary refused to even discuss them with the public. The acknowledgment is just the first step in the SEC’s approval process. According to the 19b-4 form posted on Thursday, the next stage is public comment. The filing will be published in the Federal Register, after which the public has 21 days to submit feedback. Following this period, the SEC will decide whether to approve, reject, or extend its review by opening more proceedings. This development doesn’t just affect Grayscale. Bitwise Invest, 21Shares, Canary Funds, and WisdomTree Funds, have also filed for XRP ETFs, though their applications are yet to be officially acknowledged by the agency. These companies submitted their applications after Grayscale, so their filings will be reviewed separately once acknowledged by the SEC. The SEC has also acknowledged Dogecoin ETF filings, which would have been unthinkable under the previous administration. Historically, altcoin ETF applications have either been rejected or withdrawn soon after submission. Meanwhile, President Trump has picked the crypto-loving Paul Atkins to be his SEC chairman, though he is yet to be confirmed, so we got Mark Uyeda as the acting chairman until he does, ideally by May.

Van de Poppe tells his 773,600 followers on the social media platform X that blockchain oracle Chainlink ( LINK ) appears bullish against Bitcoin ( BTC ) and could double in price. According to the widely followed analyst, the Chainlink/US dollar pair could subsequently appreciate by around 169% from the current level. “LINK forms a higher low, which indicates that we’re likely into a new uptrend. My first target is around 2x in BTC value, which should equal around $40 – $50.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X LINK is trading at $18.60 at time of writing. Next up is the native token of the layer-one blockchain project Sui ( SUI ). The widely followed analyst says Sui could go up by around 61% from the current level after bouncing off a major support zone. “SUI is an example of what the markets are likely going to do. It had a high-time frame support test of the order block around $2.50. Massive interest and price jumped up pretty quickly, to be followed with a strong green weekly candle. I think that we’ll see a new high on this soon.” Source: Michaël van de Poppe/X SUI is trading at $3.32 at time of writing, down by approximately 38% from the all-time high of $5.35.

Chainlink (LINK) is witnessing an increase in large-scale transactions, indicating a potential upturn, while Avalanche (AVAX) is under strong selling pressure with concerns it might fall below $20. Meanwhile, Web3Bay (3BAY) is gaining attention this February as it pioneers a decentralized marketplace for e-commerce, posing a significant disruption in a trillion-dollar industry. Chainlink and Avalanche are swayed by traditional market cycles and sentiments, whereas Web3Bay introduces practical applications with substantial adoption prospects. Having raised over $1.1 million and sold 295 million tokens during its presale, Web3Bay stands out not merely as a speculative investment but as a transformative approach to digital commerce, forecasting a 4,200% return on investment upon its launch, making it the prime investment option among the three. Chainlink (LINK) Prices Spike with Whale Activity Chainlink’s price is catching the market’s eye as transactions from major holders reach a 14-month peak, with 1,659 transfers over $100,000 recorded in one day. Data from Santiment shows active wallets have reached 9,531, a four-week high. This spike in significant transactions typically precedes a price increase as institutional investors prepare for anticipated market movements. Despite a recent 20% decrease, Chainlink’s price is stabilizing between its 50-day moving average at $22.76 and the 200-day MA at $15.88. Historical data suggests that substantial buys during a downturn often lead to robust recoveries. Market experts remain optimistic, predicting a rise to $32 by February, $41 by March, and potentially hitting $48 by May, which would represent an 88% growth from its current position. Avalanche (AVAX) Falls Below $27 – Could It Hit $20? Avalanche’s value has dipped below $27, continuing its decline as bearish trends strengthen. Over the past week, AVAX has seen an 18.3% fall, with a further 3.6% decrease in the last 24 hours, reducing its market capitalization to under $11 billion. Analysts caution that continued selling might push the token toward the $20 mark. Technical indicators point to increased downside risks. AVAX has slipped below its crucial 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $28.91. The Trend Strength Index (TSI) stands at -0.89, and a significant drop in the 20-day EMA reinforces the negative momentum. If AVAX does not recover above this threshold, the next key support is projected near $19.55. Web3Bay: February 2025’s Top Crypto Pick Web3Bay (3BAY) is making waves as February’s leading crypto investment by transforming e-commerce through its decentralized platform. Unlike traditional platforms such as Amazon and eBay, which enforce high fees and central control, Web3Bay allows direct transactions between buyers and sellers on the blockchain, cutting out intermediaries and slashing costs. Web3Bay leverages blockchain technology to ensure secure, tamper-proof transactions and is governed by its token holders through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), reinventing the way we think about online shopping. The Web3Bay presale is proving highly successful, raising over $1.1 million and selling 295 million tokens. Currently, in Stage 4, the token price is $0.00456, with a projected launch price of $0.1959, which could yield a return of 4,200% for early investors. Web3Bay also offers staking rewards, giving token holders a way to earn passive income and enjoy reduced transaction fees. As the global e-commerce market exceeds $7 trillion, Web3Bay is poised to capitalize on this with significant real-world applications. As crypto continues to gain mainstream acceptance, 3BAY emerges as a critical investment for February. Its robust growth potential, practical utility, and strong investor interest position it as the most attractive crypto presale currently. Web3Bay Dominates as the Top Market Pick While Chainlink’s whale activity suggests a possible price increase, its value fluctuates significantly. Avalanche contends with vital resistance points and could see further declines if sentiments do not improve. In contrast, Web3Bay promises more than speculative value—it represents a growing ecosystem with long-term expansion potential. Featuring staking rewards, decentralized governance, and real-world application, Web3Bay transcends being merely a speculative investment. For investors seeking a cryptocurrency with substantial growth prospects and practical applications, Web3Bay is a must-consider during its crypto presale . Although LINK and AVAX have their merits, Web3Bay distinguishes itself as the prime crypto investment for February, offering early participants a chance at significant returns before its official release.

Will 1Fuel Actually Be One Of The Biggest Risers In 2025?,https://timestabloid.com/will-1fuel-actually-be-one-of-the-biggest-risers-in-2025/,"Ripple’s price action is showing signs of hesitation, with traders stuck in an indecisive back-and-forth that could see its price slipping below $2. Meanwhile, a new name is making waves in the crypto market: digital assets powerhouse 1Fuel . Currently in its presale, 1Fuel is already gaining momentum, with experts predicting a potential 100x surge in 2025. But why is XRP struggling, and what makes 1Fuel the one to watch? Ripple’s Price struggles with uncertain market sentiment XRP’s price action has been underwhelming, stuck in a narrow trading range between $2 and $3. After breaking below its 100-day moving average at $2.1, Ripple XRP briefly rebounded, clearing out over-leveraged positions. However, selling pressure at $2.7 has left the token in a choppy sideways movement with little volatility. Without a clear breakout, Ripple’s price looks set to consolidate further. Buyers and sellers are contesting the next move, but the lack of strong demand suggests that Ripple may soon drop toward $1.80. As liquidity zones get tested, traders are likely to stay cautious until a definitive trend emerges. For now, cold storage solutions might be the best way for long-term Ripple XRP holders to ride out the uncertainty. 1Fuel: The next breakout token that fixes crypto’s biggest pain points While Ripple XRP faces hesitation, 1Fuel is gearing up for an explosive debut. This cutting-edge technology is addressing cross-chain transactions, one of the main issues with cryptocurrency. Trading between blockchains is now a headache. Moving money is a frustrating experience because of multiple wallets, gas costs, and slow transfers. With one-click swaps, 1Fuel resolves this issue and does away with the requirement for intricate bridges or additional network costs. Consider the possibility of being able to purchase any token on any blockchain without having to worry about delays or conversions. That’s what 1Fuel offers. Investors are paying attention because it is a game-changer. Early purchasers are protecting their tokens before the unavoidable spike, with a presale price of just $0.012. Analysts predict that 1Fuel could easily 100x once it debuts, putting it as one of the top digital assets to watch in 2025. Why 1Fuel’s presale is the smartest move right now Beyond its seamless cross-chain transactions, 1Fuel offers real incentives for investors. Staking rewards of up to 30% APR provide passive income, while its upcoming P2P exchange will eliminate intermediaries, making transactions faster and more secure. Security is also a top priority, with built-in cold storage solutions ensuring that investors’ assets remain protected at all times. As other tokens struggle with market volatility, 1Fuel is building a robust ecosystem designed for mass adoption. Because of this, analysts think 1Fuel will soon rank among the most sought-after digital assets on the market. Demand will soar as more investors realize that the presale won’t last forever. Final thoughts: XRP or 1Fuel? Ripple’s future remains uncertain as traders struggle to find confidence in its next move. With the price likely to dip to $1.80, investors might start looking elsewhere for higher potential gains. 1Fuel, on the other hand, is solving real problems, making cross-chain transactions effortless and rewarding early adopters in the process. Don’t miss out on securing your 1Fuel tokens at the lowest price. Join the presale today and be part of the future of seamless, secure crypto transactions!

The post included an official document from Crypto.com Derivatives North America (CDNA) confirming that XRP will be listed on February 14, 2025. Rietveld emphasized the potential market impact, stating that the listing could drive billions in trading volume . BREAKING: The largest North American exchange will list #XRP on February 14th, driving billions in daily trading volume! pic.twitter.com/fPD6tmV935 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) February 13, 2025 Crypto.com Expanding Options For XRP Crypto.com is the largest North American crypto exchange, and Rietveld suggested that its decision to list XRP would have a substantial effect on trading volume. His statement aligns with the growing influence of Crypto.com, which has seen a surge in market activity over recent months. The attached image shows that CDNA has formally notified the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of its intention to list a new type of financial product: an event contract based on the XRP cryptocurrency. In the letter dated February 12, 2025, CDNA submitted a product certification to the CFTC under Regulation 40.2(a) of the Commodity Exchange Act. This regulation allows exchanges to self-certify certain products for listing and trading. The XRP Crypto Event Contract The proposed “XRP Crypto Event Contract” would likely be a type of derivative that pays out based on whether a specific XRP-related event occurs. While the exact nature of these events is not yet public, they could be tied to price movements, network milestones, or similar events. CDNA aims to list the XRP event contract for trading on or after February 14, 2025. This move signals Crypto.com’s continued expansion into the derivatives market and its commitment to offering a diverse range of cryptocurrency-based financial products. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Crypto.com’s Growing Influence In recent months, Crypto.com has experienced a substantial increase in trading activity. A Coindesk report from October showed that the exchange’s monthly spot trading volume escalated from $34 billion in July 2024 to $134 billion by September 2024. The exchange captured a significant share of North America’s total crypto trading volume during that period, and this surge has positioned it ahead of competitors such as Coinbase and Kraken. Potential Market Impact XRP’s listing on a major exchange like Crypto.com is expected to boost liquidity and increase daily trading volumes. With many bullish signals surrounding the digital asset, this listing has bolstered the positive sentiment in the market. Historically, new exchange listings have led to heightened market activity. Bulls are flocking into the XRP market , and the digital asset could experience an exciting run in the immediate future. Rietveld’s post has drawn significant attention, and investors will be watching closely to see how XRP’s price responds after February 14.

However, its weekly trajectory tells a more dynamic story—while SPX6900 remains -28.93% below its recent all-time high of $1.01, it has rebounded 30.00% from its 7-day low of $0.5546.

With community-driven momentum and speculative hype fueling its rise, the TRUMP Meme Coin could continue to experience sharp fluctuations as traders seek to capitalize on its rapid gains.

40299814,https://timestabloid.com/?p=57204,1739496657,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,True Traders From The Beginning Of Solana & Cardano Have Moved Into 1Fuel (OFT) But What Is It?,https://timestabloid.com/true-traders-from-the-beginning-of-solana-cardano-have-moved/,"The shift toward 1Fuel’s presale is undeniable The tides of the crypto investment world are shifting once again, and those who’ve been in the game long enough know when to move. Cardano and Solana whales, who have weathered the highs and lows of these blockchains, are making a bold pivot toward 1Fuel. And for good reason. 1Fuel’s presale is already gaining momentum and is tipped to surge 100x in 2025 . Read on to find out why investors are locking in early. Solana whales make strategic moves Solana has been a force in crypto investment, with lightning-fast transactions and a robust community. Even the most devoted SOL investors recognize the significance of grasping fresh possibilities. Recent whale behavior in the Solana market supports this opinion. Two major Solana wallet addresses have resurfaced after months of inactivity, executing trades worth over $18.6 million. While this shows confidence in Solana’s future, it also signals a key transition: seasoned traders are looking beyond the old giants for the next major opportunity. The price of SOL hovers around $200, struggling against resistance levels. Despite technical indicators showing resilience, the excitement that once fueled Solana’s meteoric rise has settled into consolidation mode. For traders who thrive on momentum and high-growth potential, this is a cue to explore emerging alternatives like 1Fuel. Cardano’s uncertain future drives investors toward new opportunities Cardano, often praised for its research-driven development, has long been an investor favorite. But let’s face it, ADA has struggled to break out of its long-term resistance levels. The $1 target remains elusive, and while recent breakouts hint at potential, many traders are losing patience. ADA currently trades at around $0.78, showing signs of crypto investment volatility. While bullish traders anticipate a push past $0.86, the reality is that Cardano has yet to deliver the explosive growth that early investors hoped for. The market remains cautious, and traders who once championed ADA are now looking for a project with stronger growth potential. That’s where 1Fuel enters the conversation. Why Solana whales are choosing 1Fuel over established giants The core issue with Solana and Cardano isn’t their technology, it’s their stagnation. Solana is consolidating, and Cardano is struggling to break key resistance levels. Meanwhile, 1Fuel is establishing itself as a game changer, addressing the most pressing issue in cryptocurrency today: cross-chain fragmentation. For years, cryptocurrency enthusiasts have envisioned a seamless, linked blockchain world. However, the reality is a collection of disconnected networks, each with its own environment, wallets, and transaction fees. 1Fuel is set to solve this by offering a truly decentralized cross-chain liquidity protocol. Imagine moving assets between chains effortlessly, without the need for clunky bridges or excessive fees. That’s what 1Fuel promises. Beyond its technical innovation, the project’s presale is already drawing serious investor interest. With expectations of a 100x surge in 2025 , early adopters know they’re positioning themselves for massive gains before the wider market catches on. The shift is happening: veteran traders are moving their capital into 1Fuel, recognizing its potential to reshape crypto transactions. The future belongs to 1Fuel The writing is on the wall: traders who built their portfolios on Solana and Cardano are now betting big on 1Fuel. With a revolutionary approach to solving cross-chain liquidity issues and a presale that’s gaining serious traction, the opportunity is clear. The crypto world has been waiting for a seamless, interoperable future, and 1Fuel is here to deliver it. Don’t miss out on the chance to secure your 1Fuel tokens at the lowest price. Join the presale today and be part of the future of secure, cross-chain cryptocurrency transactions!

His response sheds light on Railgun, a privacy pool mechanism that seeks to allow financial privacy while implementing measures to curb rampant fraud. On Feb. 12, an attacker exploited a rounding precision issue at zkLend, which is a money-market protocol in Starknet, stolen amounting to 3,600 ETH, equivalent to $9.5m at that time. The hacker increased the “lending_accumulator” by continuously depositing and then withdrawing wstETH and then transferring the assets to Ethereum. Further, when transferring the stolen amount to a privacy-focused protocol, Railgun, which uses zero-knowledge proof, the attacker was unable to manage the assets. The Private Proofs of Innocence function in Railgun also screened out illicit funds from getting into the privacy pool. The stolen assets are still in the hacker’s wallet, which has been marked by blockchain scanners. In a post on Thursday, Buterin addressed Railgun’s response, stating that it is one of the best demonstrations of privacy pools working as intended. He also pointed out that the system did not allow the execution of unlawful operations without leading to surveillance or backdoors. Privacy pools as a compliance solution The incident illustrates the current concern over the application of regulation to privacy-enhancing technology based on blockchain. Recently, there has been an effort to shut down crypto mixers, including Tornado Cash and Bitcoin Fog, which are strictly related to money laundering. In contrast to other mixers, Railgun follows a compliance-based approach that allows it to block any fund linked to illegitimate activities. The zkLend’s team tried to contact a hacker and make a deal to keep 10% of the stolen money and return the rest. However, the hacker has yet to respond. “To the hacker: We understand that you are responsible for today’s attack on zkLend. You may keep 10% of the funds as a whitehat bounty, and send back the remaining 90%, or 3,300 ETH to be exact, to this Ethereum address: 0xCf31e1b97790afD681723fA1398c5eAd9f69B98C” zkLend Currently, security personnel from StarkWare, the Starknet Foundation, Binance Security, and other analytical firms are monitoring this address. Buterin made the comments after Threat Researcher Vladimir S. reported that the hackers who hacked zkLend aimed at laundering them through Railgun. The protocol raised the alarm and rejected the transaction, thereby proving the efficiency of the protocol in curbing misuse. The zkLend hack exposes the timely issue of privacy and compliance in the decentralized space. While transparency is useful for security purposes, exposing stolen funds to the public ledger could create a problem for ordinary wallet holders regarding their financial anonymity. Buterin has advocated using privacy tools that do not breach compliance standards. In 2023, he coauthored the research paper on Privacy Pool, a framework that will facilitate private transactions while discouraging criminal activities. For the developers who do not support Railgun’s filtering system, Buterin suggests that they establish privacy pools with different screening conditions. However, these options must be backed by the community that has robust protection of anonymity in place.

This bullish sign is reflected through PEPE’s projected breakout of the 800 EMA, which is a sign of bullish reversal. This bullish case for PEPE was first noted by a crypto analyst known pseudonymously as Slick on social media platform X. The 800 EMA, which has served as a significant resistance level for PEPE price uptrends, is now being tested again after a prolonged period below it. PEPE Eyes 800 EMA Breakout After Weeks Of Rejection PEPE is showing signs of a potential bullish reversal, with the price moving toward a critical technical level that could redefine its short-term trajectory. This critical technical level is highlighted through technical analysis of the 800 EMA indicator. Related Reading: PEPE Price Hits $0.000027 ATH, On-Chain Data Says These Are The People Driving It Since January 19, PEPE has consistently traded below the 800 EMA, a trend that has kept the price subdued despite several attempts to break higher. However, recent price action suggests that this prolonged bearish structure may be coming to an end. The moving averages are converging more than the previous attempts. The current setup shows a stronger alignment between the short and long-term EMAs, which indicates weakening resistance and increases the probability of an upward breakout. However, this attempt to break above the 800 EMA is most convincing on the 15-minute candlestick timeframe and is yet to be evident on larger timeframes. Will This Snowball Into A Larger Timeframe Reversal? The question is whether PEPE’s breakout attempt above the 800 EMA on the 15-minute chart will spark a broader shift in momentum across higher timeframes. Short-term breakouts like this serve as the primer for larger trend reversals, particularly when aligned with technical indicators such as the Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). Related Reading: PEPE Marks Bottom After Scary Market Crash, Enters Wave 3 With Over 500% Promise A successful breakout here could bring higher timeframe levels into play, which would mean a longer-term bullish momentum. However, there’s still a risk of a PEPE price rejection at the 800 EMA, even on the 15-minute candlestick timeframe. As shown in the price chart above, this rejection has already happened twice this month, once at the start of January and again on January 11. However, the current test is more peculiar because other EMAs, including the 200 EMA, have now converged more closely than during the previous failed breakouts. This alignment suggests that resistance may be weakening and increases the likelihood of a decisive move higher. At the time of writing, PEPE is trading at $0.000009829, up by 3.13% in the past 24 hours. The increase in the past 24 hours is a positive signal for PEPE’s breakout from the 15-minute 800 EMA to larger timeframes. However, there is still work to do, as PEPE is currently down by 3.85% in a seven-day timeframe. There is also a notable resistance at $0.00001019 that could delay any further uptrend move.

Established players like UNUS SED LEO (LEO) and Hedera (HBAR) are encountering hurdles, while innovative projects like Web3Bay (3BAY) are capturing significant attention. LEO, fueled by its exchange-backed structure, has the potential to reach $12.69 if market interest remains strong. Conversely, HBAR is navigating challenges below the $0.25 mark, with technical indicators hinting at continued bearish pressure. But the real story is Web3Bay. Unlike assets driven by mere speculation, Web3Bay is tackling a real-world issue: the centralization of e-commerce. By eliminating hefty fees, enhancing transaction security, and returning control to users through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), Web3Bay is primed for substantial growth. Having already amassed $1.120 million in its presale, and with a launch price projected at $0.1959, early backers could see returns as high as 4,200%. In a market craving tangible value, Web3Bay is a compelling option for those seeking the best crypto coin to invest in. With 295 million tokens already sold, the FOMO is real. LEO’s Ascent: Charting a Course to $12 and Beyond UNUS SED LEO (LEO), the utility token of Bitfinex, is currently trading at $8.67. This token, an integral part of the exchange’s financial framework, employs a structured buyback strategy. Each month, Bitfinex allocates 27% of its profits to repurchase and burn LEO, effectively reducing the circulating supply and creating scarcity. Analysts project a potential 46% surge in LEO’s value by March 2025, with the token anticipated to fluctuate between $8.62 and $12.69 in February. A consistent upward trend has already propelled LEO’s value by 4.06% in the past month, bolstering investor confidence. The Fear & Greed Index, currently at 44, indicates market uncertainty, reflecting a balance between buyers and sellers. While LEO exhibits bullish signals, the resistance level at $12.69 is a crucial point to observe. Should demand persist, LEO could surpass this level, presenting an opportunity for those interested in an exchange-backed token with a built-in deflationary mechanism. Hedera’s Predicament: Can HBAR Overcome Market Headwinds? Hedera (HBAR) continues to face headwinds, remaining below the $0.25 resistance level. Despite a substantial market capitalization of $8.7 billion, HBAR has struggled to gain significant upward momentum, and technical indicators point toward potential further downside unless buying pressure increases. The Average Directional Index (ADX) remains elevated at 41.1, signifying a strong and prolonged downtrend. Conversely, the Directional Movement Indicator (DMI) offers a glimmer of hope, with the +DI rising from 3.9 to 12.8, while the -DI has decreased from 44.7 to 28. This suggests a potential easing of selling pressure, which could lead to price stabilization in the near future. The Ichimoku Cloud chart reinforces the bearish outlook, as HBAR remains below key resistance levels, indicating continued challenges. Web3Bay: Empowering Buyers and Sellers in a Decentralized World Web3Bay is poised to revolutionize the multi-trillion dollar e-commerce sector by cutting out intermediaries, lowering transaction costs, and empowering users with complete control over their buying and selling experiences. Unlike centralized giants like Amazon and eBay, which impose restrictive policies and high fees, Web3Bay operates on a fully decentralized model, enabling secure peer-to-peer transactions via blockchain technology. Governance is entirely decentralized, with 3BAY token holders having a direct voice through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), guaranteeing that no single entity can manipulate the platform. The Web3Bay presale has generated substantial interest, raising $1.120 million, with 295 million tokens sold across various stages. Currently priced at $0.00456 in Stage 4, 3BAY is projected to launch at $0.1959, an estimated 4,200% ROI for early adopters. This is why many are eyeing 3BAY as the best crypto coin to invest in. Analysts forecast that Web3Bay could reach $0.50 by mid-2025 if adoption continues at its current rate. As blockchain technology reshapes traditional industries, Web3Bay’s secure, cost-effective, and community-driven marketplace positions it as a high-growth investment. A Quick Recap LEO and HBAR are grappling with market resistance. While LEO’s token burn mechanism provides long-term deflationary benefits, and HBAR’s enterprise adoption could fuel future demand, neither possesses the disruptive potential of Web3Bay. As crypto investors shift their focus away from meme coins and hype-driven assets, Web3Bay’s decentralized e-commerce model emerges as a true innovator. As Web3 adoption accelerates and more buyers and sellers seek blockchain-powered alternatives to centralized platforms, Web3Bay is positioned to become one of the standout success stories of 2025. For those searching for the best crypto coin to invest in, Web3Bay’s potential is undeniable.

Analyst states the network’s utility has helped reduce selling pressure, allowing SOL to maintain its position near $200. Contrary to the Solana market analysis that states that Solana held above $200, FET price fall was steep, dropping 26% in the past week as artificial intelligence tokens experienced broader market weakness. In a tragic scenario where token holders are struck with a dilemma of either holding or selling, BlockDAG ‘s affiliate program which offers 5% instant USDT cashback seems to be gearing to be the top crypto for 2025. Solana Market Analysis States the Token is Relentless, Is it The Top Crypto? The 1-hour SOL/USDT chart used for Solana market analysis shows that Solana was trading below its 20-period moving average, signalling bearish momentum. With constraint ng Bollinger Bands there seems to be less lower volatility. Delving deep into the gain and loss of Solana market analysis , The Relative Strength Index indicator (RSI) is sitting at 42.19, showing slight bearish pressure, as it is heading downwards However, its subtle upward movement hints at a potential recovery. Overall the SOL market analysis warns crypto investors to keep an eye on $200 as resistance and $185 as support. A breakout above or below either of these levels could decide Solana’s next move. FET Price Fall–26%, Was it that Steep? FET has seen a sharp decline, with the FET price fall amounting to 26% over the past week, market weakness spread across all AI tokens. Currently, FET is trading at $0.776, showing a 2.145 % loss in the last 24 hours. With a market cap of $2.05 billion, the token has a 24-hour trading volume of $719.2 million and a circulating supply of 2.6 billion tokens. Technical indicators suggest the FET price fall could continue, as the price is currently below the Golden Cross level of $1.002. The 50-day moving average at $1.2388 acts as a key resistance, while the immediate support stands at $0.7635. With more selling, the FET price fall may lead to a test of the psychological support level at $0.5000. BlockDAG’s 5% Cashback– The Presale Driving Force BlockDAG’s presale is unstoppable as it raised over $194 million, with over 18.3 billion coins sold since the launch. Early holders who took the leap of faith in buying BlockDAG are enjoying an incredible 2,380% ROI. This could position BDAG as one of the top crypto for 2025. The main driving force behind BlockDAG is fueled by its 5% Affiliate Program, which offers instant USDT cashback rewards for both referrers and new buyers. As a case in point, if a current BDAG holder refers to a friend who purchases $5,000 worth of BDAG, then both individuals become eligible to earn $250 in USDT instantly. There are no hidden conditions and terms, making the process straightforward, rewarding, and designed for growth. This basic, yet effective model has drawn participants eager to benefit from a shared-win scenario. Not only does it boost BDAG sales, but it also attracts new buyers into BlockDAG’s ecosystem, which in return motivates BDAG to give back more to the community. As the 27th batch of the presale sells out quickly, many believe the $600 million presale target is more of a reality than just a predicted value. At $0.0248 per coin, BDAG remains an appealing entry point. It’s game on! With time running out, and tokens selling like hot cakes, those joining the presale now are aiming to secure their positions before BDAG reaches its next higher price value. What Crypto Buyers are Looking For Despite the market liquidations happening, Solana market analysis made a solid statement saying that the network’s utility was the main factor that saved Solana from a great downfall. Contrasting to Solana resilience, the FET price fall was quite deep, and the artificial intelligence token fell below the 50-day moving average. This shows that projects with good propaganda will always be on the winning side. A good propaganda should always reward the community for their support and crypto buyers expect this. BlockDAG just does exactly that with its affiliate program which offers 5% instant USDT cashback on purchases.

The speculation came after the broadcast announced more third-party titles, including Capcom’s Monster Hunter Wilds, Gearbox’s Borderlands 4, Q-Games’ Dreams of Another, and more. The Xbox first-party game features on PS5 come after many predictions among gaming industry analysts that Microsoft might be forced to diversify its game offerings on multiple platforms. A recent interview with Kantan Games chief executive Dr. Serkan Toto revealed his belief that Microsoft would launch its games on other platforms this year. Toto further highlighted that factors like the acquisition of Activision Blizzard for nearly $69 billion and increasing costs will force the company to introduce its games to PlayStation 5 sooner than expected. The Kantan Games CEO speculated that gamers could expect Perfect Dark and Gears of War: E-Day in the 2025 line-up. Sony is the third company to release a teaser of what gamers can expect from the company this year. Nintendo launched the trailer of the Nintendo Switch 2, showcasing the features of the Switch 1 successor. Nintendo also teased one of the games to launch with the console, which many gamers speculated was a variation of Mario Kart. Xbox released its line-up for 2025, mentioning titles like Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, South of Midnight, Avowed, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and more. PlayStation first-party games fail to feature in State of Play The State of Play failed to feature two of the most awaited first-party games, Ghost of Yotei and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. The no-show on the broadcast came as a disappointment for many gamers, who took to social media platforms to mention its lack of appearance in the State of Play. Other titles gamers expected on the broadcast but Sony failed to showcase include God of War: Greek Saga Remaster, Parasite Eve: Remake, and Resident Evil IX. Death Stranding 2 still recently appeared on the South Korean Game Rating and Administration Committee, the VGC, which highlighted its unsuitability for children. VGC mentioned that the post-apocalyptic game had extreme violence, gore and mutilation, excessive profanity, drug expressions, and more. The game rating committee decided to classify it under the ‘not available for use by youth’ category. The game’s appearance on the rating website led to speculation that while its launch may not be imminent, the game’s development was proceeding strongly. The Death Stranding 2 director, Hideo Kojima, tweeted on February 5 an image with the words ‘A Hideo Kojima Game,’ leading to more speculations that Sony would reveal its trailer soon. Another tweet from the director before the image highlighted that he was seated at the editing machine but had not begun the editing process. Some gamers wished Kojima luck through the editing process, while others mentioned their anticipation for the trailer. Gamers still did not get what they were anticipating after the trailer failed to show up in the State of Play broadcast. Sony improves its cross-platform multiplayer gaming Sony Interactive has been focusing on improving its cross-platform multiplayer gaming ecosystem which provides a Share Link that would allow PlayStation gamers to invite other gamers from different platforms to enjoy multiplayer gaming. The company revealed its plans in a patent published on January 2 after being in filing since May last year. The patent also details how PS users can create sessions and generate responses from the session recipients. The entertainment company has also been focusing significantly on boosting user experience. Sony released another patent that suggested the use of AI to predict player movements and reduce lagging during gameplay. The patent explained that a camera would monitor the player and controller for analysis, predicting the player’s intention. The technology could also guess the player’s intentions through the initiation of the ‘incomplete controller action’ feature. A third patent floated another feature, the DualSense, which could turn the controller into a gun for RPG and first-person shooting games. DualSense would help make gamers’ experiences more realistic. The patent explained that players could hold the controller sideways after activating DualSense and holding the right arm as the gun’s handle.

Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a newbie in the crypto space, you know that the market can be volatile, but it’s also packed with opportunities. Among the names to watch are Qubetics , Algorand, and Sonic—each bringing something unique to the table. So, what’s the buzz surrounding these coins, and why should they be on your radar? Now, let’s get real. Qubetics ($TICS), Algorand (ALGO), and Sonic (SONIC) are all set to make waves in the crypto world for different reasons. Qubetics is gaining traction with its innovative approach to cross-border transactions, while Algorand continues to push the envelope with its scalable blockchain technology. And then there’s Sonic, with its focus on decentralized finance (DeFi), grabbing attention for its potential in revolutionizing financial ecosystems. But the big question is: which one will bring the most value to your portfolio? With the cryptocurrency landscape becoming more complex and diversified, we’re going to break down each of these promising projects to help you make an informed decision. As we dive deeper into Qubetics, Algorand, and Sonic, we’ll uncover their unique features, use cases, and what sets them apart in the world of blockchain. Moreover, we’ll discuss how Qubetics addresses real-life problems that its predecessors, like Kaspa and others, have failed to solve, making it a perfect fit for the future of digital finance. Qubetics: The Future of Cross-Border Transactions In the world of cryptocurrency, one of the most exciting prospects is Qubetics ($TICS), a project that’s revolutionizing the way we think about cross-border transactions. Today’s traditional banking systems are often slow, expensive, and lack transparency when it comes to international money transfers. But Qubetics is stepping in to solve these issues with blockchain technology, making global transactions smoother, faster, and more affordable for businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. Right now, Qubetics is in its 21st presale stage, having already sold over 470 million tokens to more than 19,700 holders, raising over $12.6 million. This impressive presale momentum is creating a lot of buzz, and with a current price of just $0.0733 per token, many are eager to jump on board before the project hits the next phase of its journey. Qubetics aims to transform the way we handle money across borders by offering a fast, low-cost, and efficient payment method. This could be a game-changer for businesses that rely on international trade, freelancers who work with clients worldwide, or anyone who needs to send money abroad. What makes Qubetics stand out from other coins in the market is its focus on solving real-world problems. Traditional financial institutions charge high fees for cross-border payments, and these transactions can take several days to process. Qubetics, on the other hand, uses its blockchain to eliminate intermediaries, reducing transaction costs and speeding up the process. With a $TICS token that’s expected to see substantial ROI—from 240.64% when the presale ends to 20,338% after the mainnet launch—it’s clear that this project is poised for massive growth. Qubetics isn’t just about quick transactions; it’s about building a sustainable and scalable network that will serve the global economy in the long run. As the presale continues, Qubetics is gathering a strong community that believes in the potential of its technology. The excitement surrounding the project is palpable, and it’s no wonder why it’s one of the top cryptos for massive growth right now. Algorand: Scaling Blockchain for the Future While Qubetics is focusing on revolutionizing cross-border transactions, Algorand is taking a different route by aiming to solve the scalability and speed issues that have long plagued blockchain technology. Founded by Silvio Micali, a Turing Award-winning cryptographer, Algorand offers a highly scalable blockchain that doesn’t sacrifice decentralization or security. In short, Algorand seeks to address the core limitations of older blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, which struggle to handle large volumes of transactions. One of the standout features of Algorand is its Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus algorithm, which allows the network to process thousands of transactions per second. This level of scalability could make Algorand the blockchain of choice for developers looking to build decentralized applications (dApps) and platforms that need high throughput. As blockchain technology continues to grow, Algorand could be the backbone for everything from DeFi platforms to supply chain management systems. The ALGO token, which powers the Algorand network, has seen steady growth and adoption. One key aspect that investors love is the Algorand Foundation’s focus on sustainable blockchain practices, making it a long-term player in the digital asset space. So, if you’re looking for a crypto project that’s serious about scaling blockchain technology without compromising on performance, Algorand might just be the one to watch. What sets Algorand apart from other cryptos is its focus on real-world use cases, particularly in finance, supply chain, and digital identity. With Algorand powering fast and secure transactions, businesses can leverage blockchain for more efficient operations without dealing with the limitations of traditional financial systems. Sonic: Decentralizing Finance Like Never Before Next up is Sonic (SONIC), a project that’s gaining traction for its focus on decentralizing finance (DeFi) in a way that appeals to both traditional investors and those already deep into the crypto space. Sonic aims to create a more inclusive financial system where users can participate in lending, borrowing, and trading without needing intermediaries like banks or traditional financial institutions. By eliminating the middleman, Sonic promises to offer lower fees, more control for users, and faster transactions. With its focus on DeFi, Sonic is tapping into a rapidly growing segment of the cryptocurrency market. DeFi platforms have gained massive popularity because they offer the same financial services as traditional institutions but without the restrictions or fees. Sonic differentiates itself by combining the power of decentralization with user-friendly features, making it accessible to a wider audience. What makes Sonic particularly exciting is its community-driven approach. Instead of focusing on a single corporate entity controlling the platform, Sonic allows its users to have a say in how the network operates. This decentralized governance model ensures that the project stays true to its values of openness and transparency. As Sonic continues to build its ecosystem, it’s likely to attract more users looking for innovative ways to participate in decentralized finance. Whether you’re looking to earn passive income through staking or borrow crypto without dealing with banks, Sonic has something to offer. Understanding Cross-Border Transactions in Cryptocurrency When it comes to cryptocurrencies, one of the most exciting aspects is the ability to send and receive payments across borders without the need for traditional banks. This is especially true for Qubetics, which is focused on making cross-border transaction easier, faster, and cheaper for businesses, professionals, and individuals. But what exactly are cross-border transactions, and why do they matter? Cross-border transactions involve the transfer of funds between parties in different countries. Traditional banking systems often make these transactions cumbersome and expensive due to high fees, currency exchange costs, and long processing times. Cryptocurrencies like Qubetics eliminate these barriers by allowing for near-instantaneous transactions that are not dependent on central authorities or traditional banking systems. For businesses, cross-border payments can be a huge headache. Whether you’re paying international suppliers or receiving payments from overseas customers, the costs and delays associated with traditional payment methods can add up quickly. Qubetics solves this problem by providing a blockchain-based platform that makes these transactions not only cheaper but also more secure and transparent. This is just one of the ways Qubetics is positioning itself as a top crypto for massive growth. Conclusion: As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, it’s clear that Qubetics is one to watch. With its unique approach to cross-border transactions and its focus on solving real-world problems, Qubetics is well-positioned to meet the demands of the future. Whether you’re looking to invest in a project with massive growth potential or you’re just exploring the possibilities of blockchain technology, Qubetics offers a solid investment opportunity. The Qubetics presale is currently in its 21st stage, and with over 470 million tokens sold and a growing community of holders, now is the perfect time to get in before the next phase of the project. With the potential for massive returns once the mainnet launches, there’s no doubt that Qubetics is one of the top cryptos for massive growth in 2025 and beyond.

Politicians in the land of the rising sun have also been praising the initiative, in spite of a glaring lack of focus on violent and wasteful war funding. Elon Musk’s recent White House speech about the problems of bloated bureaucracies has struck a chord with popular influencers on Japanese social media. “This is Japan!” Japanese nationalist X user Nihon Patriot declared in response to Musk’s statement that unelected bureaucrats should not hold power. Musk, who said on February 11 that “if there’s going to be fraud it should at least go to Americans” criticized unelected “leaders” (such as himself, ironically) while correctly diagnosing the bloat of the American bureaucracy. Blind praise for D.O.G.E from influencers, Japan’s political rulers It is not only social media influencers like Nihon Patriot, and “seigihakatta” (who notes that Musk is talking right to Japan as well) praising Trump and Musk, but powerful political figures like Japan’s prime minister Shigeru Ishiba and Minister of Digital Transformation (DX), Masaaki Taira. Just last week Ishiba met with Trump to discuss strengthening military alliances. The self-described “defense geek” PM has unrelentingly been squeezing the Japanese people for more military spending and investment in the US, even as the well runs dry of yen at home, and pensions for retirees and the elderly suffer. For his part, DX minister Taira has been a vocal proponent of D.O.G.E from the start, saying in November that “We would like to follow up closely and incorporate it into Japan’s administrative reform.” In the midst of Ishiba’s unprecedented one-trillion-dollar investment goal in the US, and US artificial intelligence development, the Japanese PM has also ordered Taira to get to work on an active cyber-defense system for Japan, and plans have been drawn up to increasingly govern the populace with AI. This spending has not been without controversy in the island nation, with many Japanese left wondering why so much attention and money are being pumped into overseas initiatives — especially by those vocal about government “efficiency.” War and violence — where D.O.G.E goes rabid A cursory glance at what Musk’s cartoonishly-named department has done so far (via the official website ), shows that the U.S. empire’s massive military spending has not been addressed at all. If anything, some nice bones have been thrown to people understandably tired of wasteful spending on so-called “woke” agendas like the gender debate and DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion)-related matters, and Department of Education spending has also been reduced. That is, according to the site. To advocates of freedom and fiscal conservatives, this in and of itself probably seems well and good. But in the place of such cuts, there is no resultant monetary benefit or freedom made available, social tensions between people of various backgrounds are needlessly exacerbated via statist agendas, and the war machine keeps rumbling over the bodies and bones of the oppressed as it always does. As multi-billion-dollar proof of this, Trump is now planning to send $8 billion in weapons to the government of Israel, bypassing a review process and continuing a controversial Biden-era initiative. This happens as surviving Gazans are railroaded out of their homes so the bombed-out land can be turned into a “Riviera of the Middle East” controlled by the United States. How this is fiscally efficient, or how it will actually help to mitigate the Israeli state-funded Hamas terror group — and not just murder thousands more innocent people — seems to have escaped Elon’s attention, and that of the Japanese politicians and social media fanboys.",OP-ED|D.O.G.E|Israel|Japan|JPY|USA,EN,0,0,DOGE|ASIA,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-02-14 02:30:46

The video game retailer, known for its wild meme stock history, is considering adding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to its balance sheet, according to a report from CNBC. The news sent GameStop’s stock surging as much as 20% in extended trading. The company is still deciding. There’s no official commitment yet. “GameStop is exploring it, but nothing is final,” a source close to the company said . Executives are reviewing whether Bitcoin fits into the company’s financial strategy before making a move. GameStop’s Bitcoin talks and Ryan Cohen’s involvement GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen fueled speculation over the weekend when he posted a picture on X with Michael Saylor, the co-founder and chairman of MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. But despite the online frenzy, two sources confirmed that Saylor is not involved in GameStop’s crypto investment discussions. This wouldn’t be GameStop’s first crypto venture. In 2022, the company launched a crypto wallet to support Bitcoin, Ethereum, and NFTs. But by 2023, it shut the service down, blaming “regulatory uncertainty.” Cohen, the billionaire behind Chewy, has been running GameStop since 2021. He originally joined as an investor in 2020, right before the stock became the face of retail trader mania. His leadership has focused on cost-cutting and operational efficiency rather than aggressive expansion. As of November 2, GameStop had a $4.6 billion cash reserve, according to a December securities filing. That money has been earmarked for investments, and Bitcoin is now on the table. In December 2023, GameStop’s board approved an updated “investment policy.” It gave Cohen, two independent board members, and select staff the power to manage the company’s securities portfolio. Any investments outside the policy require approval from either the committee (by unanimous vote) or the full board (by majority vote). Bitcoin as a corporate asset: Who else is doing it? If GameStop follows through, it will join a growing list of companies adding Bitcoin to their corporate treasuries. The biggest name on that list is MicroStrategy, which rebranded as Strategy after shifting its focus to Bitcoin. Led by Saylor, the company has accumulated 471,000 BTC—roughly 2% of all Bitcoin in circulation. In 2025 alone, it has made four Bitcoin purchases, including two billion-dollar acquisitions. MicroStrategy’s strategy has paid off. Over the past year, its stock has soared more than 400%. With an $83 billion market cap, it’s now bigger than Capital One and Target. Other companies are following suit. According to crypto security firm Coinkite, at least 78 corporations worldwide now hold Bitcoin in their treasuries. OneMedNet, a healthcare data company with a $30 million market cap, raised $4.6 million through a private stock sale and immediately used the funds to buy Bitcoin. The reason? To fight off short-sellers. Another example is KULR, a company specializing in thermal energy management for NASA and the U.S. Navy. It recently bought 510 BTC. “A Michael Saylor inspiration,” KULR CEO Michael Mo said. Since announcing in December that it would put 90% of its surplus cash into Bitcoin, KULR’s stock has jumped 117%. GameStop already has experience handling digital assets. If it moves forward, it would be one of the biggest names yet to take Bitcoin onto its balance sheet. The decision could signal a shift in corporate treasury management, pushing more public companies to embrace Bitcoin as a financial asset.

Rooted in the original BitVM protocol, Bitlayer's Finality Bridge introduces the first version of the protocol live on testnet, which is a good starting point for realizing the promises of the Bitcoin Renaissance or “Season 2”. Follow GG on X Unlike earlier BTC bridges that often required reliance on centralized entities or questionable trust assumptions, the Finality Bridge leverages a blend of BitVM smart contracts, fraud proofs, and zero-knowledge proofs. This combination not only enhances security but also significantly reduces the need for trust in third parties. We’re not at the trustless level that Lightning provides, but this is a million times better than current sidechains designs claiming to be Bitcoin Layers 2s (in addition to significantly increasing the design space for Bitcoin applications). The system operates on a principle where funds are securely locked in addresses governed by a BitVM smart contract, functioning under the premise that at least one participant in the system will act honestly. This setup inherently reduces the trust requirements but has to introduce additional complexities that Bitlayer aims to manage with this version of the bridge. Source: https://blog.bitlayer.org/introducing_finality_bridge/ The Mechanics of Trust In practical terms, when Bitcoin is locked into the BitVM smart contract through the Finality Bridge, users are issued YBTC - a token that maintains a strict 1:1 peg with Bitcoin. This peg is not just a promise but is enforced by the underlying smart contract logic, ensuring that each YBTC represents a real, locked Bitcoin on the main chain (no fake “restacked” BTC metrics). This mechanism allows users to participate in DeFi activities like lending, borrowing, and yield farming within the Bitlayer ecosystem without compromising on the security and settlement assurances that Bitcoin provides. While some in the community might find these activities objectionable, this type of architecture allows users to get some guarantees that they previously could not hope to get with traditional sidechain designs, with the added bonus that we do not need to “change” Bitcoin to make it happen (although covenants would make this bridge design completely “trust-minimized, which would effectively make it a “ True ” Bitcoin Layer 2). For more details about the different levels of risks associated with sidechains designs, take a look at Bitcoin Layers assessment of Bitlayer here . However, until such advancements come to fruition, the Bitlayer Finality Bridge serves as the best realization of the BitVM 2 paradigm. It's a testament to what's possible after the dev “brain drain” from centralized chains back to Bitcoin. Despite all the challenges that BitVM chains will face, I remain exceptionally excited at the prospect of Bitcoin fulfilling its destiny as the Ultimate Settlement Chain for all economic activity.

With its innovative blockchain and AI integration, Lightchain AI is rapidly gaining attention from investors. The Lightchain AI Presale has already raised over $15.3 million at a presale price of $0.006, signaling strong confidence in its potential. As both XRP and Lightchain AI aim for significant growth, they’re becoming key players in the evolving crypto market. XRP Aims for New ATH- What’s Behind Surge As of February 7, 2025, XRP is trading at approximately $2.32, reflecting a slight decline from its recent peak. The cryptocurrency reached an all-time high of $3.40 on January 16, 2025. Analysts suggest that breaking through the $3.40 resistance could propel XRP to the $4.20–$4.50 range. Some projections are even more optimistic, with targets up to $8, contingent on favorable market conditions and regulatory developments. The recent surge is attributed to investor optimism regarding potential regulatory clarity and increased adoption of Ripple’s payment solutions. However, market volatility remains a concern, and XRP’s future performance will depend on broader cryptocurrency market trends and ongoing legal developments. Lightchain AI- Aiming for 28x Rally Lightchain AI is garnering significant attention in the cryptocurrency market due to its innovative integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Analysts project that its token, LCAI, could experience a substantial increase, potentially reaching $3 by the end of 2025—a remarkable rise from its presale price of $0.006 This optimistic outlook is driven by Lightchain AI’s unique Proof-of-Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for performing valuable AI computations, thereby enhancing network security and efficiency. Additionally, the platform’s Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) enables seamless execution of AI-specific tasks on the blockchain, positioning it as a leader in decentralized AI applications. The project’s successful presale, raising over $15.3 million, reflects strong investor confidence in its potential. As the demand for AI-driven blockchain solutions grows, Lightchain AI’s strategic approach and technological advancements make it a promising candidate for significant returns. Invest Now- Lightchain AI is Set to Outshine Competition With its disruptive integration of AI and blockchain technology, Lightchain AI is poised for significant growth in the cryptocurrency market. As XRP aims for a new ATH and Lightchain AI sets its sights on a 28x rally, both projects represent opportunities for investors to capitalize on the evolving landscape. As always, it’s essential to do your own research and consult with financial advisors before making any investment decisions. However, keeping an eye on these two key players in the crypto space could prove beneficial as they continue to push boundaries and make waves in the industry. Don’t miss the opportunity to be an early investor in Lightchain AI , a groundbreaking project revolutionizing the AI landscape.

While major tokens like Bitcoin (BTC) , and Ethereum (ETH) have strong use cases, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL sets itself apart as the most exciting opportunity for exponential value creation. Here’s why this token is dominating the conversation. Why THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Stands Out 1. Limited Supply Creates Scarcity With a total supply capped at 100 billion tokens, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL ensures scarcity that fuels long-term value. Unlike BTC and LTC, which have slower growth due to high circulation, this token’s deflationary model guarantees increasing demand. 2.

While Bitcoin and Polkadot are well-established, they can’t match the rapid trajectory of this groundbreaking token. 4. Investor Demand at Record Levels Raising $1,000,000 within minutes of its presale launch, THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL has proven its appeal. Investors recognize its potential to redefine the market, driving interest far beyond what UNI, BTC, or LTC have recently seen. How THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL Compares Uniswap (UNI): A strong DeFi platform but lacks the exclusivity and demand-driving scarcity of THE MAGACOINOFFICIAL . Polkadot (DOT): Reliable for interoperability but cannot match the early-stage explosive growth seen here.

Currently, Ethereum (ETH) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) are experiencing interesting price movements, while Web3Bay is making significant strides with its web3 crypto project, having already raised over $1.120 million in its ongoing presale, selling over 295 million tokens. These digital assets have captured the attention of both seasoned and novice investors. Let’s examine these three projects and their potential. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action: Anticipating a Potential Upswing Ethereum (ETH), currently trading around $2,610 after a recent dip, has captured the attention of analysts who are observing a four-year ascending triangle formation. This pattern suggests a possible breakout to a target price of $7,500. While the SEC’s decision on Ethereum ETFs remains pending, influencing market sentiment, the network is witnessing increased support for a gas limit increase. This adjustment could enhance network efficiency and reduce transaction fees, further solidifying Ethereum’s position in the cryptocurrency space. Despite short-term price fluctuations, Ethereum’s fundamental strength lies in its widespread adoption and continuous development within its ecosystem, particularly in DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts. These factors contribute to the confidence of long-term holders. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Whale Activity and Market Dynamics Shiba Inu (SHIB) presents a complex picture. Large holder netflows have increased by 5,277%, indicating significant accumulation by major wallets. A substantial whale transaction involving 3.36 trillion SHIB tokens, valued at $51.15 million, has further fueled market discussions. However, this accumulation is juxtaposed with a decline in trading volume, which has fallen below $400 million, and a 61% reduction in the burn rate. This slowdown in the burn rate suggests a possible cooling-off period for SHIB. Although Shiba Inu benefits from a strong community, its reliance on community support and the development of long-term utility remains crucial. The concentration of SHIB tokens in the top 10 wallets, which hold 61.3% of the total supply, also introduces a potential for price volatility. The increase in large holder net flows is a positive sign for Shiba Inu and shows that there is still interest in the project, but the decrease in trading volume and the burn rate is something that should be monitored. Web3Bay’s Million-Dollar Presale Has Everyone Talking! Web3Bay is introducing a new paradigm for online buying and selling through its 3BAY token. Unlike traditional e-commerce platforms that charge fees on every transaction, Web3Bay eliminates intermediaries, leading to lower costs and greater benefits for both buyers and sellers. Sellers retain a larger portion of their earnings, and buyers enjoy more competitive prices. This is all facilitated by blockchain technology and smart contracts, ensuring transparency and security. The 3BAY token serves as more than just a payment method; it’s a rewards system. Users can earn discounts, cashback, and even governance rights, empowering them to participate in the platform’s future development. The Web3Bay presale has been highly successful, raising over $1.120 million and selling over 295 million tokens, demonstrating strong investor interest. Currently priced at $0.004562625, the 3BAY token is expected to reach $0.1959 at its launch, offering early investors a substantial potential return. Web3Bay’s approach to e-commerce, combined with the 3BAY token’s utility, positions it for continued expansion within the web3 space. The project’s focus on real-world application distinguishes it from many other projects. The Web3Bay team is working to provide a seamless user experience. The platform also plans to integrate traditional payment methods like PayPal, making it accessible to a wider audience. The project’s vision is to make cryptocurrency accessible to everyone. The Web3Bay presale offers an opportunity to get involved in the future of decentralized e-commerce. Concluding Thoughts Ethereum’s price action suggests a potential upswing, while Shiba Inu experiences a mix of positive and concerning signals. Web3Bay, with its innovative approach to e-commerce and successful presale, presents a unique opportunity for investors seeking exposure to the web3 space. Each of these projects offers distinct possibilities within the cryptocurrency market, and investors should carefully consider their individual risk tolerance and investment goals when evaluating these options. The Web3Bay presale, with its current price point and future potential, offers an interesting entry point for those interested in the future of decentralized e-commerce. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, projects like Web3Bay, Ethereum, and Shiba Inu will continue to be closely watched by traders and investors.

This lack of intrinsic value will make it highly susceptible to rapid decline which in the case of PNUT dropped from over $2 billion market cap to 171 million. PropiChain’s Presale Success: The project has raised more than $2.5 million in presale, and the early investors that joined the first round are already in profit by more than 150%. Joining now when it is still going for a discounted price of $0.011 means you will be in profit by the third stage and it will keep ascending. Technological Innovation and Real-world Impact: PropiChain aims to capitalize on techs like the Metaverse, artificial intelligence and blockchain to reshape and make the global real estate market efficient. These offerings make the project attractive to the Solana PNUT trader. Hereunder, we will further look into how this technological innovation will benefit investors. PropiChain Aims to Reshape the Global Real Estate Market PropiChain aims to tokenize the real estate industry, and introduce a fractional ownership model. Therefore, entering the real estate industry will become easier because this model will abolish financial restrictions that reserve the sector for wealthy investors. For instance, instead of the 10% mortgage upfront payment or any other loan to get a property of high-value, you can obtain a fraction of it. This means you can invest $100 in an asset worth $25,000 and still earn a profit from it. Also, the DeFi feature of PropiChain decentralized platform lets you stake the portion purchased as collateral which can earn interest for you. If you wish to sell off your asset, investors can buy it in fractions. This will lead to enhanced liquidity in the real estate market. PropiChain’s artificial Intelligence will also assist investors in filtering property listings to get property that resonates with their preferences and goals. Users can utilize the advanced filter to highlight assets with growing trends or neighborhood amenities if that is what they are in the market for. The PropiChain AI can also recommend assets similar to your search history in the future, saving you the stress of re-initiating the advanced search criteria. When you’re ready to pay, the AI technology on this decentralized marketplace ensures the pricing is right. Using the Automated Valuation Models (AVMs), the Artificial Intelligence consults multiple information to arrive at accurate cost. This includes current market trends, historical price performances, and economic indicators. With the AVMs at your disposal, you can never overpay for a property or get underpaid for the property you wish to sell. Get your investment decisions right with predictive market analysis compiled by PCHAIN’s AI. This technology will evaluate different data from different sources to forecast property that may increase or decrease in value. Leveraging these analyses helps you make strategic decisions that will mitigate risky investments. For buyers and sellers who want to explore the real estate market in locations far from them, the feature Metaverse will enable and ke it easy. For instance, if you stay in New York and wish to own properties in Singapore, you can use the interactive environment of the Metaverse to inspect houses listed by sellers in Singapore. Also, once you find a property that fits your need, meetings can be help with sellers on the realistic environment of the Metavrse to close the deal. All these are executed on the PropiChain decentralized platform with maximum security and transparency. PropiChain’s public ledger stores all transactions In the market and this ledger is tamper-proof and available to every PropiChain user. This transparency level makes it difficult for fraudulent intermediaries to attempt to scam you. All you need to do is to verify the property details on the public ledger before authorizing payment. This security is confirmed with the BlockAudit rigorous review of the PropiChain’s smart contract. This crypto security firm tested the resilience and compliance to the industry standard. The result shows that the platform’s security system is flawless, giving investors peace of mind concerning their investment on PCHAIN. PropiChain Could Deliver Massive 80,500% Rally Unlike Solana memecoins, PropiChain is offering a solution in a sector that is one of the biggest globally. The real estate market is valued at over $300 billion globally. The focus and the revolutionary solutions PCHAIN will offer in this sector mean it could attract both institutional and retail investors, which will drive its value up. The broader cryptocurrency market is increasingly developing interest in AI and RWA narrative and PropiChain is a leader in the two spaces. Also, the project is witnessing a massive adoption and the CoinMarketCap listing further increases its visibility globally. Therefore, analysts believe PCHAIn is a high-potential project and delivering 80,500% ROI by 2025 Q2 is a no-brainer. Conclusion PropiChain’s alignment with the growing interest in AI and RWA further strengthens its appeal among investors. The analysts’ optimistic growth trajectory of an 80,500% ROI by Q2 of 2025 reflects PCHAIN’s high potential status. Therefore, joining at the current stage when it is going for a discounted price of $0.011 is once in a life-time opportunity. Also, an investment of $1000 in this current stage could yield more than $800k by Q2 of 2025. PropiChain could replicate the Solana early rally, and this is the best time to join.

Recently, a Dogecoin millionaire from the community spotted PCHAIN as the best altcoin to buy in 2025 . This dogecoin millionaire selection of PCHAIN is based on its token presale trajectory, which has already raised over $2.2 million, and its real-world utility use case that tackles traditional real estate investment process through its core AI integrations and blockchain technologies. In this article, we will look at why this dogecoin millionaire named PCHAIN as the best altcoin to buy in 2025 and how its AI features contribute to its upsurge among investors. Why are Dogecoin Millionaires Hunting for the Next Big Altcoin? Few crypto communities have had the massive adoption of Dogecoin garnered over the years. It all started as a meme coin launched based on social media buzz and celebrity endorsements like Elon Musk, and it grew by a large margin within a short period. However, despite its massive popularity, its lack of real-world utility use cases has been a major factor contributing to Dogecoin’s top holders diversifying their portfolios. With the crypto space rapidly shifting towards AI projects, crypto experts believe investing in altcoins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Cardano will only limit investors’ returns in the long run. While Dogecoin price swings are exciting, many investors are looking for the next breakthrough altcoin, like PropiChain which combines real-world use cases with cutting-edge technology. AI Features Contributing to PCHAIN Gaining Traction as the Best Altcoin to Buy Several crypto projects claim to be the best altcoin to buy in 2025; however, PropiChain stands out as a real estate AI altcoin due to its AI features that focus on automating and streamlining complex transaction processes. At the core of these features is its advanced AI integration, which automates various processes by allowing users to perform predictive market analysis and provide property suggestions through its automated valuation model and AI-power chatbots. This chatbot offers users 24/7 real-time support and guidance as they navigate the PropiChain platform, providing easy-to-understand explanations of real estate legal and financial agreements before they buy or sell their assets. Its property suggestions also analyze multiple data sources by providing recommendations based on users’ preferences and continuously learning to adapt to users’ interactions, considering a wide array of factors, including location preferences and desired property features. PropiChain metaverse implementations are also designed for international investors who don’t have the luxury of time to be physically present when trying to buy, sell or invest in an asset. Through its immersive 3D environment, investors can experiment with different layouts, designs and customized options of properties from anywhere in the world without any geographical barrier. Its virtual stagings also serve as a powerful marketing tool, making listings more attractive and engaging to prospective buyers. Likewise, its virtual meetings allow users to stay responsive through each decisive process, ensuring active participation during real estate exploration. Compared to other real estate AI altcoins, PropiChain is implementing advanced features to digitalize properties and assets, ensuring all transactions are made on a secure blockchain network without needing to document each process physically. It also implements fractional ownership of properties whereby assets can be sold, bought, and managed in smaller fractions by a broad range of investors instead of streamlined top whales in the market. This process further increases liquidity and access to financing on a secure and transparent platform, where all participants are verified, maintaining the integrity and transparency of the transaction process. Conclusion: Dogecoin Millionaires are Betting Big on The Best Altcoin to Buy, So Should You! After analyzing Dogecoin’s market trends, the rise of AI-driven crypto, and the unmatched potential of PCHAIN, Dogecoin millionaires strongly believe that PCHAIN is the best altcoin to buy in 2025. Its token presale is currently in its round two stage, selling at a low price of $0.01, the lowest valuation it will ever be before it skyrockets by 108.93% in round three. By investing just $3000 in PCHAIN, crypto analysts believe it could experience an explosive rally of over 100,000x yielding a minimum of $300,000, similar to Dogecoin’s legendary 2017 price surge when DOGE went from fractions of a cent to $0.70 in just months. PCHAIN has undergone a security review by BlockAudit and is listed on CoinMarketCap , confirming its credibility and strong roadmap. Buy PCHAIN tokens today before it hits the mainstream market!

While investors wait for the Dogecoin price to finally break out, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has surged 900%, grabbing the attention of traders struggling to find gains in this bear market. Rather than suffering like most assets, WallitIQ (WLTQ) continues to rise, proving that real innovation, strong tokenomics, and AI-driven utility can thrive even in the toughest conditions. With its presale price set to jump from $0.0420 to $0.0620, early adopters are rushing in before takeoff. However, this is just the beginning. While Dogecoin price and other meme coins stall, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is positioned to dominate the bear market, offering massive profit potential to early movers. Why Dogecoin Price Stagnates While WallitIQ (WLTQ) Surges In A Bear Market The Dogecoin price has struggled to gain serious momentum, remaining stuck well below $1 despite short-term fluctuations. The past month has been brutal, with Dogecoin price down nearly 23.9%, proving that meme hype alone isn’t enough to sustain growth. With no major developments or new adoption drivers, Dogecoin price remains vulnerable in this bear market, unable to generate the excitement it once had. Meanwhile, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has taken a completely different path, surging despite the bear market because of its AI-driven ecosystem, ultra-low transaction fees, and many other outstanding features. Unlike the Dogecoin price trajectory, which primarily relies on speculation, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is solving real problems in the crypto space. This AI-powered wallet simplifies crypto payments and portfolio management, offering tools like predictive analytics, sentiment analysis, and customized market alerts that give users an edge in trading and investing, even in a bear market. Another key factor in WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) 900% price explosion is its smart tokenomics. With only 45% of its supply allocated for public sale and 15% reserved for exchange liquidity, demand is rapidly outpacing available supply. While the Dogecoin price struggles under selling pressure especially given its outrageous market cap, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) limited token availability and high staking incentives are creating an environment where prices can only go up. The fact that investors can participate in yield farming and also earn up to 180% APY in staking rewards makes it even more attractive, giving traders a way to profit without relying solely on price action. With The WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale Almost Gone, What Happens Next? The bear market has exposed weak projects and rewarded the strongest ones. WallitIQ (WLTQ) has proven it belongs in the latter category, with its presale selling out at record speed. As the price moves from $0.0420 to $0.0620, investors who locked in early are already seeing gains, while those who hesitate risk buying at much higher levels. Beyond its presale success, WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) upcoming Beta Platform Launch is set to shake up the industry. Unlike Dogecoin (DOGE), which still lacks a clear roadmap for innovation, this crypto project is mapped out for continuous development. Through the Beta Platform Launch , investors can try out the platform’s features like its MVP app that simplifies crypto transactions, merges multiple wallets, and aids portfolio management. With a thorough SolidProof audit and other security measures like AES & ECC encryption, P2D technology, AI-powered anomaly detection, and Escrow Connect , this platform protects both assets and data in the bear market. Exchange listings are on the horizon, meaning that WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) current price surge may only be the beginning. As more investors discover its potential, demand will continue to rise and only those who get into the presale now will see potential profits even in the consuming bear market. Dogecoin Price Struggles, WallitIQ (WLTQ) Keeps Climbing: Join The Presale Now For 900% Gains The bear market has revealed which projects are built for long-term success and which are struggling. Dogecoin price remains weak, with no significant growth despite repeated breakout attempts. WallitIQ (WLTQ) , however, has surged 900% in one of the harshest bear markets, proving it’s more than just hype. With its presale price of $0.0420 set to rise, exchange listings approaching, and a game-changing Beta Platform launching, this project is shaping up as one of 2024’s smartest investments. While the Dogecoin price stays stuck, early WallitIQ (WLTQ) investors are thriving in a bear market. To join them, purchase WLTQ tokens now.

With every cycle, new meme coins emerge, fueled by hype, community support, and fresh innovations in the crypto space. While many projects burn out as quickly as they launch, the true winners are those that offer real utility or capture the attention of millions. One project that’s dominating the conversation right now is BTFD Coin , a play-to-earn (P2E) powerhouse that’s reshaping how meme coins function. With a massive gaming ecosystem and real in-game earnings, BTFD is one of the top new meme coins to join for 2025 before its presale ends. Meanwhile, Popcat is proving that meme culture remains an unstoppable force, generating millions in trading volume with pure viral appeal. And Shiba Inu, no longer just a “Doge Killer,” is expanding into DeFi, the metaverse, and gaming, keeping it firmly in the top-tier of meme investments. BTFD Coin – P2E Gaming Meets a 3,650% Moon Price Potential BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s reinventing play-to-earn (P2E) gaming by allowing players to earn real crypto rewards for their in-game progress. This is a game-changer for meme coins, as it offers an actual use case beyond just trading. Gamers can now stack BTFD tokens while competing, then stake them for 90% APY, further increasing their earnings. Imagine a future where every victory in the BTFD ecosystem translates into real value. Whether it’s battling other players, completing missions, or unlocking achievements, every move has the potential to earn tokens that can be held, traded, or staked for more passive income. With gaming being a $200 billion industry, BTFD Coin is positioned to tap into a massive audience that extends far beyond traditional meme coin investors. Now let’s talk numbers. BTFD Coin is currently priced at just $0.00016, and analysts predict that once the token goes live, it could surge to $0.006, meaning early investors could secure a 3,650% ROI. If someone buys 40,000 BTFD today using the LAUNCH100 bonus code, their holdings instantly double to 80,000 BTFD. At the projected post-launch price of $0.006, that $6.40 investment today could turn into $480. BTFD Coin’s presale has already raised over $6 million, gained more than 10,600 holders, and sold over 69 billion tokens. But with only two stages left before launch, the window to lock in these presale prices is quickly closing. If you want in, this is the last chance before the FOMO kicks in and prices shoot up. Popcat – The Meme Coin That’s Breaking the Internet If Dogecoin taught us anything, it’s that meme power is real, and Popcat is proving it once again. What started as a viral meme of an open-mouthed cat has now evolved into a full-fledged crypto movement, attracting thousands of new investors daily. Unlike traditional projects that rely on complex roadmaps, Popcat thrives purely on viral appeal, making it one of the most unpredictable yet rewarding meme coins on the market. The community backing Popcat is growing at an explosive rate, fueled by TikTok trends, influencer hype, and a flood of trading volume. Many investors dismissed Dogecoin in its early days, thinking a joke coin could never be taken seriously—until it reached a $90 billion market cap. Popcat is now in a similar position, and with its low supply and growing adoption, it could be one of the most surprising breakouts of 2025. If the meme rally accelerates, some analysts speculate that Popcat could 5x or even 10x in price, making it one of the top new meme coins to join for 2025. While meme-based investing is high risk, the potential upside for Popcat is undeniable. Shiba Inu – The Meme Coin Expanding into DeFi and the Metaverse Once known as a Dogecoin rival, Shiba Inu has evolved into one of the most sophisticated meme coins in the industry. With the launch of Shibarium, its layer-2 blockchain, SHIB is now a key player in DeFi, gaming, and the metaverse, ensuring its long-term growth. One of Shiba Inu’s biggest moves has been its metaverse expansion, allowing users to buy digital land and interact within a decentralized virtual world. Unlike most meme coins, SHIB is building a sustainable ecosystem, integrating ShibaSwap (its decentralized exchange) and NFT utility to further drive adoption. With Shibarium reducing gas fees and transaction speeds, more projects are choosing to build within the SHIB ecosystem, boosting token demand. Some analysts predict that Shiba Inu could see a 500% surge in 2025, especially if its metaverse and gaming integrations gain mainstream adoption. For investors looking for a long-term hold, Shiba Inu’s continued expansion makes it a strong meme coin to bet on. Final Thoughts – The Clock Is Ticking for These Meme Coins The top new meme coins to join for 2025 are already making waves, and for those looking to maximize gains, timing is critical. Meme coin rallies move fast, and missing out on early entries often means missing out on the biggest profits. BTFD Coin is the clear standout, with its play-to-earn gaming ecosystem, massive staking APY, and presale price of just $0.00016. With only two stages left before launch, this is the last opportunity to buy before the price shoots up. Popcat is proving that meme culture is still one of the strongest forces in crypto, with a rapidly growing market cap and viral backing. If history repeats itself, Popcat could follow in Dogecoin’s footsteps and deliver unexpected gains. Shiba Inu continues to build beyond the meme coin label, expanding its metaverse, DeFi, and gaming integrations. With 500% price growth predictions, it remains one of the top meme coins for long-term investors. With BTFD Coin’s presale coming to a close, the final opportunity to buy at these prices is NOW. If you’re serious about catching the next 3,650% moonshot, the time to act is today—because once Stage 16 sells out, there’s no turning back.

BTFD Coin isn’t just a meme token—it integrates play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, allowing players to earn real crypto rewards. With 90% APY staking and a presale price of $0.00016, it’s one of the most profitable short-term plays in the market. Is Popcat a good investment for 2025? Popcat has built a massive viral following, making it one of the most talked-about meme coins of the year. If its current momentum continues, analysts predict it could see 5x or even 10x returns. Will Shiba Inu continue to grow in 2025? Shiba Inu’s Shibarium network, metaverse expansion, and DeFi integrations make it one of the most sustainable meme coin projects.

ETH might gain bullish momentum if it clears the $2,750 resistance zone. Ethereum started a fresh increase above the $2,620 resistance level. The price is trading above $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,640 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a decent upward move if it settles above $2,750 and $2,800. Ethereum Price Eyes Steady Increase Ethereum price remained supported above the $2,550 level, like Bitcoin . ETH formed a base and recently started a fresh increase above the $2,600 and $2,620 resistance levels. The bulls pumped the pair above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $2,794 swing high to the $2,614 low. The pair is now moving higher above the $2,680 level. There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2,640 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $2,650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $2,700 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downside correction from the $2,794 swing high to the $2,614 low. The first major resistance is near the $2,750 level. The main resistance is now forming near $2,800 or $2,820. A clear move above the $2,820 resistance might send the price toward the $2,920 resistance. An upside break above the $2,920 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,000 resistance zone or even $3,050 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $2,750 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,655 level or the 100 hourly SMA. The first major support sits near the $2,620 zone or the trend line. A clear move below the $2,620 support might push the price toward the $2,600 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,550 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,440.

After recently slipping below $100,000, the cryptocurrency now hovers around the $95,000 mark, causing uncertainty among investors. Despite these setbacks, some analysts see signs that the market’s bull cycle may still have room to run. CryptoQuant contributor MAC_D recently examined the current state of Bitcoin’s realized market capitalization, offering insights into what might lie ahead for the asset. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Struggle Below $100K: Could These Market Signals Trigger the Next Rally? Bitcoin Realized Cap as a Bullish Indicator According to Mac’s analysis, Bitcoin’s realized market capitalization—calculated by summing the value of each Bitcoin based on its last recorded transaction price—has reached an all-time high, surpassing $857 billion. This increase occurred even as Bitcoin’s price experienced a downturn. Traditionally, a rising realized cap indicates that coins are being sold by long-term holders and absorbed by new investors. This redistribution cycle often reflects a healthy, ongoing bull market rather than the end of one. Mac noted that the proportion of long-term holders who have held Bitcoin for more than six months currently stands at 39.74%, compared to 15.66% during the previous market peak. This higher percentage suggests that long-term holders remain active, and the market has yet to reach its zenith. While the data indicates that the bull cycle continues, external factors such as trade tensions and inflation could still influence short-term corrections. However, Mac believes these macroeconomic elements won’t derail the market’s long-term upward trajectory. The analyst wrote: The increase in realized market cap and the decrease in long-term holder ratio indicate that the market is still in a bull cycle. However, investors should also consider macroeconomic factors such as trade tensions and inflation. While these factors may lead to short-term corrections and periods of price stability, the long-term upward trend is expected to persist. Retail Activity Shows Signs of Revival In addition to realized cap metrics, other market indicators also suggest potential positive developments. Another CryptoQuant analyst, caueconomy, highlighted retail investor behavior as a key factor to watch. While retail demand for Bitcoin has been muted over the past month—declining by just 2% compared to a steeper 20% drop in January—there are signs that this normalization period is ending. Historically, increases in retail activity have coincided with improved market sentiment and short-term price rallies. If retail participation resumes, it could strengthen Bitcoin’s market structure and contribute to a broader recovery. Although Bitcoin’s current consolidation phase has tempered its recent performance, these underlying metrics provide some optimism for investors.

The biggest crypto exchange in the U.S. reported fourth-quarter revenue of $2.27 billion, a 130% jump from last year and well past the $1.88 billion analysts had expected, according to LSEG data. Net income? $1.3 billion, or $4.68 per share, compared to just $273 million, or $1.04 per share, a year ago. The surge came as a post-election crypto rally sent prices soaring, pushing trading volumes through the roof. The company’s transaction revenue hit $1.56 billion, more than double last year’s number, crushing Wall Street’s $1.29 billion forecast. Trading volume also exploded, reaching $439 billion, up 185% year over year. Retail traders fueled most of the action, with consumer trading volume skyrocketing 224%, while institutional trading rose 176%. Coinbase shares jumped 2% in extended trading after the earnings release. Trading frenzy fuels Coinbase’s record quarter Coinbase credited its monster quarter to rising crypto prices and extreme volatility. “The majority of the Y/Y growth in Trading Volume was driven by higher levels of Crypto Asset Volatility—particularly in Q1 and Q4—as well as higher average crypto asset prices,” the company wrote in its shareholder letter. The exchange pointed to two major catalysts: the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in Q1 2024 and the election of a pro-crypto President and Congress in Q4 2024. Both events fueled expectations of regulatory clarity, leading to a flood of spot crypto trading. Wall Street had been bracing for strong numbers, but the actual results went beyond what analysts had priced in. Coinbase’s earnings per share ($4.68) crushed estimates ($1.81), showing just how much trading activity accelerated in the final months of 2024. Robinhood’s earnings gave an early hint of Coinbase’s breakout quarter. The stock and crypto brokerage posted a 700% spike in crypto trading revenue and saw crypto volumes soar more than 400% in Q4. Robinhood’s stock surged 12% after its report, while Coinbase saw a 6% jump in sympathy. Analyst John Todaro of Needham called Robinhood’s earnings a strong indicator for Coinbase, noting that a massive wave of retail trading in November and December pushed revenue to unexpected highs. “We are expecting a strong Q4 from COIN after HOOD posted better-than-expected results,” he wrote in a note. Todaro is keeping an eye on retail trading fees, stablecoin adoption, and crypto legislation timelines as key drivers for Coinbase’s 2025 performance. Coinbase shifts focus beyond trading revenue Despite record-breaking trading activity, Coinbase is working to diversify its revenue streams. Trading still makes up 68.5% of total revenue, but the company wants to expand its subscription and services business. Revenue from subscriptions, which includes stablecoins, staking, custody, and Coinbase One, is projected to land between $685 million and $765 million in Q1 2025. One of the biggest drivers? USDC, the stablecoin issued by Circle, which has a revenue-sharing agreement with Coinbase. Chief Financial Officer Alesia Haas told CNBC that USDC is well-positioned for growth as Congress moves closer to passing stablecoin legislation. “We can drive utility in this where we can drive more trading pairs on our own platforms denominated in USDC, which drives the liquidity, and the more liquidity you have in any asset, that drives more adoption,” she said. CEO Brian Armstrong doubled down on USDC’s potential. “Our stretch goal is to make USDC the number one stablecoin,” he said on the earnings call. Right now, USDC holds 26% of the stablecoin market, trailing Tether’s 67%, but Coinbase sees an opportunity to increase adoption through deeper liquidity and regulatory clarity. Looking ahead, Coinbase has already generated $750 million in trading revenue through February 11. Trading revenue is expected to remain in the mid-to-high teens as a percentage of net revenue in Q1 2025. Not all analysts are convinced the trading boom will continue at this pace. Todaro cautioned that the meme coin mania crash in January could weigh on February trading volumes and drag into Q2. Robinhood’s crypto volumes suggest a 15% drop in Q1 from Q4, which could indicate a similar slowdown for Coinbase. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev addressed the surge in crypto activity on his company’s earnings call, saying that nine different business lines generated over $100 million in annual revenue, with options, equities, and futures trading also driving growth. Net deposits for Robinhood hit $50 billion for the year, showing broader strength across asset classes, according to Vlad.
