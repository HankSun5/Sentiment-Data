Expert Analysts Give Their Predictions,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-history-repeat-itself-in-bitcoin-btc-expert-analysts-give-their-predictions/,"Cryptocurrency analysis company Alphractal drew attention to Bitcoin’s 4-year fractal cycle in its latest report. The company stated that this cycle has been repeated consistently since 2015, making BTC one of the most symmetrical assets in financial history. In its analysis published in November 2024, Alphractal predicted that the next cycle peak for Bitcoin could occur between October 12-16, 2025. Now, with only 6 months left until this estimated peak, the report stated that the fractal structure is still intact. The company stated that Bitcoin has determined both the top and the bottom of every cycle without error since 2015, which is an unprecedented achievement in the financial world.

It was noted that if history repeats itself, remarkable price movements could occur in the coming months. “Time will tell, but for now, Bitcoin's strong and delicate fractal structure remains intact.

Speaking during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group spring meetings in Washington, Muhammad confirmed that Pakistan already holds a 30 billion yuan currency swap with China but now wants to boost it to 40 billion yuan. “From our perspective, getting to 40 billion renminbi would be a good place to move towards… we just put in that request,” Muhammad said . The swap expansion request ties into Pakistan’s urgent need to keep access to foreign currencies stable while strengthening its financial reserves. Besides pushing for a larger swap deal, Muhammad said Pakistan is getting close to launching its first-ever Panda bond, which is debt issued in China’s domestic market and denominated in yuan. Talks have been underway with the heads of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to secure credit enhancements for the bond issuance. Muhammad said discussions with both banks have been “constructive” and added, “We want to diversify our lending base and we have made some good progress around that—we are hoping that during this calendar year we can do an initial print.” Pakistan pushes for more support while managing new tensions China has been pushing swap agreements with several emerging economies, including Argentina and Sri Lanka, and now Pakistan is trying to extend its arrangement to keep up with growing financial needs. Muhammad said the plan to issue the Panda bond fits into Pakistan’s broader strategy to tap new markets and avoid overreliance on traditional lenders. On the international aid front, Muhammad said he expects the IMF executive board to approve Pakistan’s new $1.3 billion deal under a climate resilience loan program in early May. This approval will also cover the first review of the country’s existing $7 billion bailout package. Once the IMF board signs off, Pakistan will immediately unlock a $1 billion payout, a vital piece of the financial plan Pakistan secured in 2024 to prevent a full-blown economic collapse. Asked about the effects of escalating tensions with India, Muhammad said it would be “not helpful” for Pakistan’s economic outlook. Earlier this month, after the killing of 26 men at a tourist site, both countries retaliated. Pakistan shut its airspace to Indian airlines and froze trade ties. India responded by suspending the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, which controls how water from the Indus River system is shared. Muhammad pointed out that even before the latest dispute, trade between the two countries had already shrunk massively, totaling just $1.2 billion last year. Turning back to the domestic economy, Muhammad forecasted that Pakistan would hit about 3% growth for the financial year ending in June 2025. He said the country is aiming for growth of 4-5% the following year, with longer-term hopes of reaching 6%. He emphasized that expanding financial sources like the Panda bond, enlarging the swap line, and securing IMF funds are all pieces needed to hit those targets. Meanwhile, amid Pakistan’s strengthening relationship with China, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent met with Asian Development Bank President Masato Kanda on Friday. Bessent pressed Kanda to start moving China toward “graduation” from ADB borrowing, arguing that China’s economy no longer needs the same level of development bank assistance. The Treasury Department said Bessent also pushed Kanda to focus on “best value” procurement practices and pointed out the need for an “all-of-the-above energy strategy,” including financing options for civilian nuclear power projects.

Find Out!,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/was-jed-mccalebs-exit-from-ripple-a-breakup-or-a-brilliant-strategy-find-out/,"The post Was Jed McCaleb’s Exit from Ripple a ‘Breakup’ or a Brilliant Strategy? Find Out! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Jed McCaleb’s departure from Ripple in 2014 has long been the subject of speculation. Many believed it was the end of his involvement with the company, but what if it wasn’t a breakup? What if Jed’s split was a strategic move, part of a bigger plan to create a parallel blockchain system? Ripple & Stellar: Split That Wasn’t a Split Jed McCaleb, one of Ripple’s co-founders, was key in designing XRP’s early framework. He helped build XRP’s architecture and contributed to Ripple’s initial success. After some disagreements, Jed McCaleb left Ripple in 2014 and quickly started Stellar (XLM). (1/ ) Jed Didn’t Leave Ripple. He Was Assigned to Start Stellar. You were told it was all falling out. But what if Jed McCaleb’s split wasn’t a breakup… It was a deployment? And what if XRP and XLM were never rivals — but two arms of the same global plan? Let’s dive deep: pic.twitter.com/0v53GExE3j — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) April 26, 2025 While many thought it was a breakup, the timing looks more like a planned move. It happened just as Ripple was growing in the world of big finance and global payment systems. Eventually, if we look at the timing of Jed’s departure, it aligns perfectly with Ripple’s institutional expansion, the rise of the ISO 20022 standard , and discussions by global financial bodies like the IMF, the BIS, and the WEF about the future of payments. This suggests that Jed wasn’t leaving; he was deployed to launch the second half of a global payment solution. XRP and XLM: Complementary, Not Competitive Ripple’s XRP and Stellar’s XLM were never rivals; they were two parts of the same global plan. XRP focuses on improving liquidity, enabling cross-border payments, and supporting central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the financial industry. On the other hand, Stellar works on bringing blockchain technology to underserved communities, humanitarian efforts, and retail stablecoin transactions. Strategic Partnerships on Both Sides Both Ripple and Stellar have quietly secured powerful partnerships. Ripple works with major financial institutions like Bank of America and SBI, supporting international banking systems. Meanwhile, Stellar is closely tied to humanitarian projects, with the United Nations using it for blockchain-based aid and Franklin Templeton using it for tokenizing assets. Jed McCaleb’s exit from Ripple wasn’t an accident; it was part of a well-timed plan. As Ripple focused on the institutional side, McCaleb’s Stellar project set out to bring the power of blockchain to the people.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY|XLM|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-26 20:37:32

On Saturday, Tesla’s Canadian website posted a banner that said: “Explore pre-tariff priced inventory while supplies last.” The move came after President Donald Trump dropped a fresh 25% tariff last month on Canadian goods, including vehicles with parts made outside the US, even under the US-Mexico-Canada trade pact. Canada immediately hit back with retaliatory import taxes aimed at mirroring the American tariffs. Pricing on Tesla’s site as of April 26 showed a big gap between new orders and existing inventory. A new long-range Model 3 with all-wheel drive jumped to C$79,990 (about $57,700). But identical 2025 model year cars already sitting in inventory were listed for around C$69,000. The difference made it obvious Tesla wanted buyers to move fast before getting hammered by higher prices. The sharp price increases were first spotted by DriveTeslaCanada.ca, which reported that for some models, the hikes are brutal. New orders for the all-wheel drive Cybertruck are now up to 22% more expensive than inventory models. For Canadian buyers trying to hold out, that’s bad news. Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, hasn’t made things easier north of the border either. Elon took heat in Canada after standing by Trump, who has openly joked that he wants Canada to join the United States. The eccentric billionaire recently promised that starting next month, he would spend more time focusing on Tesla, after the carmaker suffered its worst first-quarter financial results in years. Tesla stock rises after US pushes faster self-driving car rules Tesla shares jumped nearly 10% on Friday after Trump’s White House announced a plan to speed up self-driving vehicle approvals. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy revealed new rules that loosen federal safety standards for autonomous vehicles. That announcement gave Tesla a rare win after a rough few months. The rally followed a long stretch of losses for Tesla, with shares dropping around 40% since the beginning of 2025. The trade wars, tariffs, and nonstop market swings made it worse. Tesla also posted its worst quarterly loss since 2022 during the first three months of this year. Wall Street scrambled to respond. Piper Sandler said the earnings report was “the best result that TSLA bulls could’ve reasonably hoped for,” noting that “management said enough to keep the dream alive.” Even though problems still exist, the firm said the update helped calm some fears. Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said he thinks Tesla can make more money from software tied to full self-driving technology over the long term. But despite the optimism, Delaney kept Goldman’s neutral rating and cut Tesla’s price target. Others stayed skeptical. UBS and Wells Fargo both kept negative outlooks on Tesla. Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan cut the firm’s price target for Tesla from $130 to $120. UBS warned that excitement over Tesla’s planned June robo-taxi launch might push the stock price up temporarily, but said it could end badly for some investors. They also flagged that Tesla might drop its plan for a low-cost vehicle launch, killing a potential catalyst for future growth. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Amid the ongoing market euphoria, prominent blockchain analytics company Glassnode has shared some important developments in the Bitcoin derivative markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Apparent Demand’ Makes Sharp Rebound – Will BTC Breakout Soon? Bitcoin Short Bets Rise Despite Price Rally, Setting Stage For Volatility Despite a bullish trading week, derivative traders are approaching the Bitcoin market with skepticism, as evidenced by a build-up of leveraged short positions. In a recent X post on April 25, Glassnode reported that Open Interest (OI) in Bitcoin perpetual swaps climbed to 218,000 BTC, marking a 15.6% increase from early March. In line with market activity, this rise in Open Interest aligns with increased leverage, introducing the potential for market volatility via liquidations or stop-outs. Generally, a rise in Open Interest amidst a price rally is expected to signal long-term market confidence. However, Glassnode’s findings have revealed an opposite scenario. Despite Bitcoin’s bullish strides in the past week, short market positions appear to be dominating the perpetual futures markets. This concerning development is indicated by a decline in the average funding rate, which has now slipped into negative territory to sit around -0.023%. The perpetual funding rate is a periodic payment between long and short traders aimed at keeping the contract price in line with the underlying spot price. A negative funding rate indicates short traders pay long traders as Bitcoin’s perpetual contract price is trading below the spot price. This is caused by a higher number of short positions as traders are largely bearish about Bitcoin, even despite recent gains. Furthermore, the 7-day moving average (7DMA) of long-side funding premiums has dropped to $88,000 per hour, reinforcing this short-dominant sentiment. This downtrend indicates a waning demand for long positions, as traders exhibit a short bias. However, Glassnode presents a bullish note stating that the present combination of rising leverage and short positions paves the way for a potential short squeeze, where an unexpected upward price move forces short-sellers to close their positions, thereby driving prices even higher. Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $94,629 following a 1.01% retracement from its local peak price on April 25. Despite creeping developments in the perpetual futures market, the BTC market remains highly bullish, indicated by gains of 1.02%, 11.12%, and 8.32% in the last one, seven, and thirty days, respectively. With a market cap of $1.88 trillion, the premier cryptocurrency ranks as the largest digital asset and fifth-largest asset in the world.

This rebound, fueled by fear, confusion, and desperate buyers, happened so fast it left most traders spinning. According to data from CNBC, the index jumped more than 10% from its lowest close and ripped 14% higher from the savage April 7 intraday low. The snap rally kicked off after a massive flight out of US dollar assets and Treasuries created a gaping hole in the market. The S&P 500 punched right into the gap left by the April 3 panic selloff. On a closing basis, the index has recovered exactly half of what it lost, but the damage to investor confidence and market structure still stinks. Buyers rush in as technical signals flash green Some of the technical signals flashing during this rebound would make a Wall Street nerd drool. Thursday triggered the rare and hyped-up Zweig breadth thrust, where the market sees a cluster of extreme positive breadth days after being smashed down. There have been 19 known cases of this since the 1940s, and every time, the S&P 500 finished higher six to twelve months later. Still, some analysts argue that recent decades brought more false alarms because of decimalized trading and a flood of ETFs letting people yank the whole market around at once. Bespoke Investment Group said every stock in the Nasdaq 100 went green on Tuesday. The S&P 500 also posted three straight days of gains over 1.5% from Tuesday to Thursday. History shows that when either of those two freak events happens, the market is usually higher a year later. But with small sample sizes and typical 12-month market gains anyway, nobody should be calling it safe just yet. Retail investors were the only ones consistently buying the dip, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s private-client flow data. Meanwhile, fast-money speculators flooded back after the multi-day rally last week. Jonathan Krinsky from BTIG, who had called for a short-term rally, warned Friday that the market could stall. He said the Goldman Sachs Retail Favorites Basket spiked 11.4% in just four trading days. The last two times that happened, in November 2022 and March 2022, massive plunges followed almost immediately. Tariffs fuel fears of deeper economic pain The recent S&P 500 drop fits a weird pattern where stocks bottom just shy of a 20% loss on a closing basis. The closing low in this pullback slipped a hair past 19%, which happened in 1990, 1998, 2011, and 2018, too. Only 1990 came with a US recession. But now, the odds of a full-blown recession are shooting up fast. Trump’s tariff war has companies slashing hiring plans and investments, bracing for harder times ahead. Trump’s delay on tariff hikes and talk of possible trade deals gave investors hope that the worst might still be avoided. But everyone is watching if soft economic data, like consumer surveys and CEO sentiment, starts leaking into hard facts like jobs and spending numbers. The start of Q1 earnings season brought a typical 70% of companies beating expectations, but CEOs had almost nothing good to say about the future. The tariff cloud hangs over everything. Companies are basically admitting they can’t give real guidance because this one man could yank the tariffs higher at any moment with literally no warning. FactSet reported, “To date, the market is rewarding positive earnings surprises reported by S&P 500 companies for Q1 more than average and punishing negative earnings surprises reported by S&P 500 companies for Q1 less than average.” Research from 3Fourteen shows that after 10% corrections, future earnings projections split depending on whether a recession hits. Before the last few weeks, the forecast looked more like the “no recession” track, but now estimates are slipping, raising more alarm. The liquidation frenzy that hit a few weeks back, mixed with the global “Sell America” wave, made even weak hints at easing tariffs and slightly better economic data enough to yank stocks higher. But closing the rest of the gap from February’s highs won’t be easy. Past panics like Russia’s 1998 default and the 2011 debt-ceiling mess didn’t feel resolved when the market started to bounce either. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The market has been rife with up-and-coming assets, each promising the next big thing. You’ve probably seen how fast coins like Solana exploded and became a “must-have,” only for it to settle and leave a few scratching their heads. With the rise of new projects in 2025, there’s one coin that’s currently making waves: Qubetics ($TICS). Could it be the next big thing? While the likes of Solana were once considered the future, could Qubetics be the missed opportunity of tomorrow? Let’s dive in and take a closer look. As the crypto market continues to shift, one thing remains clear—timing is everything. Solana was once the talk of the town, offering scalability and speed. But now, as its growth slows, attention has started to shift toward other rising stars. That’s where Qubetics comes into play. With its innovative tech and strong fundamentals, this new project is quickly gaining traction. The Qubetics presale has already raised over $16.4 million, and the token’s price is still incredibly affordable at $0.1902. Here’s why Qubetics might just be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. Solana: A Missed Opportunity or a Lesson Learned? Solana was once hailed as the “Ethereum Killer.” It promised to solve the scalability problems that Ethereum struggled with, offering faster transaction speeds and lower fees. During its peak, Solana soared to new heights, pushing its price to over $250 per token. If you caught the Solana wave early on, you were likely sitting on some serious gains. But now, things are different. The once-mighty Solana has seen its value fluctuate, and while it’s still a top crypto asset, it’s no longer the new and shiny thing. For some, Solana’s rise was the stuff of dreams, but its later decline serves as a reminder of how volatile the market can be. Despite its speed and scalability, Solana faced network outages, security concerns, and increased competition. These factors led some to lose faith in its long-term potential. But what if you missed the boat on Solana? If you did, you might be feeling a bit of FOMO, especially as new projects like Qubetics pop up with fresh promises. Unlike Solana, Qubetics seems to be addressing real-world issues that many previous crypto projects couldn’t. Why Qubetics ($TICS) Is the Next Big Thing in Crypto Now, let’s talk about Qubetics. Unlike Solana, which focused primarily on scalability and speed, Qubetics is here to solve some of the most pressing problems faced by businesses and individuals in today’s digital world. One of the key reasons Qubetics is gaining attention is its focus on interoperability. It’s designed to work seamlessly across various blockchain platforms, enabling different networks to communicate and share data effortlessly. In a world where cross-chain compatibility is still a challenge, Qubetics has positioned itself as the solution. The Qubetics presale is currently in its 31st stage, and it has already sold over 509 million tokens to more than 25,200 holders, raising over $16.4 million. Despite all this success, the price of $TICS is still just $0.1902 per token in the current presale stage, making it an affordable entry point. Analysts predict that after the presale, $TICS could soar to $1, giving holders a 425% return on investment. If the price hits $5 after the presale, that’s a staggering 2527% ROI.

This surge has propelled several alternative coins into the spotlight. Among them, SUI , VIRTUAL , and WLD are making notable gains. The article explores their current performance and potential for future growth, shedding light on which coins might see continued upward movement. SUI Bullish Surge: Gains and Key Price Levels SUI experienced a 37.16% rise over the last month and a remarkable 104.78% gain within six months. Price gains have been swift and pronounced, with weekly changes reaching 69.65% and stirring strong market interest. The data reflects a robust move upward over both recent short-term and longer-term periods, highlighting the coin’s growing momentum. SUI now trades between $1.74 and $3.03, with immediate resistance at $3.78 and a second hurdle at $5.07, while support is seen at $1.21. A high RSI of 77.58 indicates strong buying pressure, though caution is warranted for potential pullbacks. Traders might consider targeting resistance levels and watching for a breakout to signal the next leg in this market move. Virtuals Protocol Price Movements Amid Recent Volatility VIRTUAL experienced a rapid surge over the past week with prices soaring almost 93%. The one-month change reflected a solid gain of around 45.57%. However, over the half-year, the coin saw a moderate decline of 13.61%, indicating a mix of performance. Price changes have been characterized by short-term spikes and more tempered mid-term corrections. Recent activity suggests increased trading interest, but a stable long-term trend has not yet formed. Current trading sits between $0.35 and $1.02, with key resistance at $1.46 and solid support near $0.12. A high RSI near 79 signals bullish pressure, though caution is warranted. Traders might consider buying near support and monitoring for breaks above resistance while placing stops around the lower level for risk management. Worldcoin Market Outlook: Short-Term Gains Amid Longer-Term Decline Last month, WLD showed a clear rebound with a 26.55% increase and a 66.14% jump over one week. Despite this bullish momentum, the six-month figure dipped significantly by 42.39%. Price action has been characterized by volatility, with rapid rallies followed by notable pullbacks, creating a mixed picture of recent performance. Current trading stays between a low of $0.35 and a resistance near $1.47, indicating upbeat short-term momentum driven by bullish pressure. The range between $0.56 and $1.12 suggests a potential buying zone. Traders should monitor a breakout above $1.47 or consider exiting if the level fails to hold, ensuring risk management within these key levels. Conclusion The recent bounce in Bitcoin has led to a surge in altcoins like SUI , VIRTUAL , and WLD . SUI is showing strong potential with growing interest. VIRTUAL is gaining momentum driven by innovative features. WLD has seen a significant rise and continues to attract attention for its unique offerings. The positive trend in Bitcoin has provided a much-needed boost for these altcoins, suggesting an optimistic outlook in both the short and long term. Future performance of these coins will depend on sustained interest and further market developments. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Simkus reported on Friday at the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund in Washington that global trade weakness, largely caused by new US tariffs, is bringing a new threat to Europe’s economy. He also noted that inflation was already declining and could slow down even further in the coming months. The deposit rate was cut for the seventh time since June last year, to 2.25%. However, Simkus thinks there is still room to ease policy without generating financial instability or overheating the economy. Simkus said there was no reason to remain in the current financial environment and that he could not rule out two more cuts this year, given the data he had in front of him. However, he added that more negative surprises would be needed to move lower. His remarks echo what the market has been expecting. Investors are betting on at least two further rate cuts this year. Some analysts, including the ones at Bank of America, forecast that the deposit rate could drop by 1.25% by December, suggesting four further tiny cuts. Simkus also emphasized that the ECB’s approach remained nimble and said he did not think they were late cutting interest rates. US tariffs and strong euro drag down expansion New evidence points to a softening of the eurozone’s economic recovery. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for eurozone GDP, citing mounting trade tensions and tighter financial conditions as key factors. Simkus conceded that policymakers had been “overly optimistic” in predicting how fast the economy would rebound. He added that slower wage growth throughout the euro area has become a symptom of cooling demand. He also cited the recent strength of the euro against other currencies, which makes European exports less competitive abroad. US tariffs, meanwhile, have diverted more Chinese goods to Europe, adding disinflationary pressure. These factors are likely to be reflected in the ECB’s next batch of economic projections, which are set to be published in June. According to Simkus, the new numbers “are expected to include weaker economic growth and slower inflation than the assumptions” made in the previous forecast. Nevertheless, Simkus discounted even more substantial interest rate reductions unless the economy weakens precipitously. For now, the ECB will probably stick to its usual quarter-point steps. EC B sets the pace for action, not reliant on US deals Simkus also emphasized that the ECB will not sit back and wait until the US trade negotiations are imminent. The 90-day wait by the administration of President Trump was an attempt to impose some tariffs as binary options to enable trade agreements with major trading partners. Even with the US ultimatums to some countries, Simkus warned that trade policy uncertainty will probably remain. Several ECB officials shared similar views last week, citing softer manufacturing data and weaker growth in the service sector. Now, markets are watching economic data and the comments from ECB officials up to the bank’s next policy meeting in June. If the economy stays weak, a further rate cut could occur as soon as that meeting, leaving the ECB firmly on its current course of cautious but steady easing.

According to the company’s data, RAY has the highest Long/Short ratio among all altcoins. Following RAY, GTC, COS, DOT, ALPHA, MELANIA, AUDIO and REZ are among the other altcoins where long positions are higher than shorts. The Alphractal team noted that excessively high long/short ratios generally negatively impact altcoin performance, but can also occasionally trigger price bottoms. According to the company, this can create a short squeeze dynamic, with traders closing long positions and opening short positions when prices start to rise again. However, it was emphasized that an increase in Open Interest volume is required for this scenario to occur. Alphractal predicts that there is currently no significant increase in Open Interest in altcoins, so prices may move sideways in the coming days.

Expert Analysts Give Their Predictions On the other hand, Alphractal CEO Joao Wedson announced that an important signal has re-emerged on the Bitcoin side. Wedson stated that the Bitcoin/Stablecoin Reserve Ratio on Binance has given a signal in the $76,000–$77,000 range again, reminding that this level has predicted major Bitcoin rallies in the past. Wedson used the following statements in his statement: “This behavior suggests that stablecoin reserves are growing faster than Bitcoin reserves, suggesting that there is ample capital ready to flow into crypto assets. The same signal appeared after the ‘Coronadump’ in 2020, at the end of 2022, and now again. In all of these instances, the Bitcoin price reacted positively.” *This is not investment advice.

Instead, employees say it barely works, and a mismanaged launch has left many wondering if automation is the right path for America’s largest social services agency. In recent months, Musk’s organization, known internally as DOGE , has aggressively reduced federal agencies by cutting jobs and budgets. The push toward an “AI-first” model aims to replace human workers with software wherever possible. As part of that strategy, the new chatbot was built into the everyday workflows of agency staffers, reported by Wired, with the promise of easing their workload. An internal email described it as a way to “assist employees with everyday tasks and enhance productivity,” but in practice, the app has received little attention. Sources inside the agency say the roll-out was accompanied by a painfully bad training video featuring a poorly animated, four-fingered woman. The clip was supposed to guide users through the app’s features, but it failed to warn staff against uploading sensitive personal data. This slip forced the agency to send a follow-up email reading, “Our apologies for the oversight in our training video,” to warn employees of the risk. Few people have taken the SSA AI training video seriously “I’m not sure most of my coworkers even watched the training video,” one Social Security staffer told Wired. They added that when they tested the chatbot, “several of the responses I received from it were incredibly vague and/or inaccurate.” Other employees reportedly mocked the crude graphics. “Nobody I know is [using it]. It’s so clumsy and bad,” the source said. Critics warn that this stumbling start may foreshadow wider failures. Similarly, in Brazil, during 2018, a state-owned company called Dataprev launched Meu INSS, an app designed to process social security claims using computer vision and natural language processing. However, the system has often rejected valid claims due to minor errors, triggering lengthy legal appeals. One example involves 55-year-old Josélia de Brito, a former sugarcane worker whose retirement application was denied because the automated system misidentified her gender. “I have all the documents proving my health condition, proving everything, and [the benefit] still gets denied. It’s a humiliation,” she told the Rest of World. Rural farmworkers, many of whom lack basic digital skills, have struggled with the shift to online services. “People out here cannot [even] work with Gmail, Facebook, Instagram,” said Francisco Santana, president of the Union for Rural Workers at Barra do Corda. “Processes are [getting] more and more automated, and society wasn’t made ready for it, especially further away, in the outskirts, for people that live in rural areas.” Those hurdles abroad highlight potential pitfalls for the U.S. Social services are already under pressure to “modernize,” a push that began under the Trump administration’s team of so-called technocrats. Musk’s DOGE has taken that mission further by seeking to cut the federal workforce in half. “Everything that can be machine-automated will be. And the technocrats will replace the bureaucrats,” a person familiar with DOGE’s plans told the Washington Post. DOGE’s emphasis on automation has bred confusion rather than efficiency. A recent mishap at the SSA illustrates the stakes. DOGE staff reportedly marked “countless” living benefit recipients as “dead,” cutting off their payments. “About 4 million people, they marked them as dead,” said Rennie Glasgow, a longtime claims technical analyst at the agency, speaking to The Daily Beast. “They’re sending us an email saying, ‘If these people come into the office with their identification, you can reinstate them.’” That reinstatement process can take “about three to four days,” Glasgow added, as staff must manually “resurrect” each recipient in the system. Beyond stopping benefits, DOGE also plans to rewrite the SSA’s entire software codebase within months. Sources say that to meet that deadline, the team will almost certainly rely on AI for coding, a practice that demands close oversight because of the high error rate in machine-generated code. Given DOGE’s rocky track record so far, an automated overhaul could introduce even more chaos. Some observers suspect those mistakes may be intentional. A school of critics argues that DOGE’s goal isn’t genuine reform but rather the destabilization of the SSA to pave the way for privatization. If so, the misfires and mayhem may be exactly what Musk’s team is aiming for. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The company confirmed the purchase of 111 Bitcoin at an average price of around $90,000 per coin. Overall, Semler now holds more than 3,300 Bitcoin, valuing its total crypto treasury at about $300 million. Measuring Bitcoin Yield Performance Semler highlighted that its Bitcoin acquisitions have contributed to a Bitcoin yield of 23.5% for shareholders so far this year. The Bitcoin yield metric compares the company’s Bitcoin holdings to its number of outstanding shares, helping to demonstrate how Bitcoin exposure per share has grown. “Semler Scientific uses BTC Yield as a [key performance indicator] to help assess the performance of its strategy of acquiring bitcoin in a manner Semler Scientific believes is accretive to stockholders,” the company explained. Since initiating this strategy in February, Semler has been aggressively building its Bitcoin position. Financing the Bitcoin Strategy The company stated it purchased its Bitcoin treasury for an average price close to $89,000 per coin. With Bitcoin currently trading at around $95,000, Semler’s investment has seen early gains. To support its Bitcoin acquisitions, Semler has financed the purchases by issuing roughly $125 million in new stock. Additionally, in January, the firm announced plans to raise another $75 million through a private offering of convertible senior notes. Semler Scientific primarily operates in the healthcare sector, developing diagnostic products that help detect chronic diseases. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings on the Rise Semler’s move follows a broader trend among corporations accumulating Bitcoin for their treasuries. Data shows public companies collectively hold approximately $71 billion worth of Bitcoin as of April 25. Leading the pack is Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which boasts a treasury valued at over $50 billion. During the week of April 14 alone, Strategy acquired an additional 6,556 Bitcoin at an average price of $84,785 per coin. Despite corporations building significant Bitcoin reserves, they still trail behind Bitcoin holdings managed by exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which control about $110 billion in Bitcoin. Semler’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy mirrors the growing institutional appetite for digital assets, signaling a continuing shift in corporate finance strategies.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-26 21:51:46

The cryptocurrency analyst from SwallowAcademy predicts Dogecoin (DOGE) will experience a 40% price decrease which will push its valuation to $0.09 before starting its rise. During its presale funding phase Mutuum Finance (MUTM) managed to secure $7.2 million in investment money while distributing 425 million tokens to a total of 9,100 token holders. The current price of the token stands at $0.025 during phase 4 but it aims to achieve a 140% gain until it reaches the public listing value of $0.06. This DeFi project’s systematic growth path proves itself to be a dominant competitor against Dogecoin in the crypto market space. Dogecoin’s Uncertain Path Dogecoin shows price volatility with trading at $0.1832 following its 103% volume increase that drove trading volume to 1.89 billion. The analyst Steph_iscrypto predicts a breakout based on a 129-day price downtrend which has historically led to 500% market runs. SwallowAcademy presents an unfavorable view of Dogecoin by warning about its impending collapse because hype serves as a crutch for its survival. JavonTM1 forecasts Dogecoin will reach $1.25 but each successive higher low points to susceptibility. The path of Dogecoin progresses without practical use and depends heavily on social opinion and potential ETF project initiatives. Structured investment alternatives feature low volatility which compels investors to choose projects using concrete financial instructions. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently operates within phase 4 while its token price remains at $0.025. The strong market interest led investors to purchase 9,100 tokens out of the 425 million available which generated $7.2 million in total sales. Current buyers participating in Phase 5 will obtain a 20% increase as the token value rises to $0.03 from the current $0.025 during phase 4. Tokenomics structure ensures investors will achieve a total 140% return after the assets list on exchanges for $0.06. An analysis predicts Mutuum Finance tokens will reach $3.50 after launch date which would result in a 13900% return on investment across phase 4. One starts with a $1,000 investment and will grow to become $140,000 during 2025. A Certik smart contract audit result will soon be made available through social channels to enhance trust in the platform. Mutuum’s DeFi Edge Mutuum Finance now permits the top 50 community members to receive bonus tokens as part of their extended platform support. Mutuum Finance runs with a stable lending system that combines peer-to-peer together with peer-to-contract lending due to its overcollateralized loan requirement and interest-generating capability of mtTokens. The platform directs revenue towards buying tokens to sustain market demand through its buy-and-distribute operation strategy. A rapidly selling ecosystem in Phase 4 serves as the main advantage for early platform investors to take an interest. The utility-based approach of MtToken outperforms Dogecoin because it draws investors whose main goal is dependable market expansion. Why Mutuum Outshines Dogecoin The predicted 500% rally for Dogecoin entices investors yet its speculative nature fails to match Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that utilizes mathematics to construct its DeFi system. The entry price of $0.025 during Phase 4 operates as a brief but vital moment to achieve 140% listing revenue growth and subsequent opportunities for up to 13,900% returns when the price reaches $3.50 in 2025.

In the ever-changing world of digital assets, Cardano (ADA) finds itself at an important stage, with its price action presently moving around the most important support levels. This moment, noted by attentive investors, shows that it is a decisive period for the token and is in contrast with the increased exposure and bullish sentiment surrounding both Avalanche (AVAX) and the emerging force that is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Cardano’s Balancing Act: Testing Key Support Cardano’s journey has never lacked drama for those who have always followed its developments and price movement. According to the latest live market data, ADA is presently trading around the $0.38 price mark–a zone that is watched closely by analysts and investors. While the project’s community and its technology remain strong, investors are still advised to be cautious. A drop below the $0.38 support could open the asset to an increased movement downwards. A sustained bounce here could also kickstart bullish optimism Experienced traders are looking at the best entry strategies ADA’s ability to hold ground here will likely shape the way the token will trade. Avalanche Builds Momentum Amid Investor Optimism AVAX Rises with Ecosystem Growth and Layer 1 Traction Avalanche (AVAX) has been seeing increased analyst attention thanks to its huge ecosystem advances and a clear rise in investor demands. According to live data, the token is trading around $26.07, seeing a jump of 9% in the past week, showing a big market interest. AVAX is benefitting from scalability and its high-speed transaction capabilities. Its growing ecosystem has been impressing developers and investors alike. Its position in the layer 1 space appears to favor the token. Smart investors see this action as evidence of Avalanche’s strong positioning within the broader crypto industry. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rare, High-Reward Opportunity Emerging While established projects continue to move close to important technical levels, experienced investors are currently scanning the market for opportunities where rewards could transform things. Enter MAGACOIN FINANCE–the new crypto star attracting lots of forward-thinking investors looking for early entry. Structured for long-term upside and designed for increased multiple growth.

Knowledgeable traders recognize this upside before the rest of the market catches on, seeing that the entry window is still open, and the token is still trading below its breakout zone. Why Investors Are Jumping In Now For experienced investors, the mathematics is simple: the best opportunities are found where Visionary projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer the best entry position ahead of the herd.

As the market consolidates strength and early signals flash, these projects are standing out for their ability to anchor the next major crypto wave—and those positioning early could be preparing for a major run. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing Early-Stage Momentum That Can’t Be Ignored Projects that succeed over the long term always show early signs—measured growth, strong community expansion, and consistent delivery. MAGACOINFINANCE is hitting all of those marks right now. Wallet adoption is rising daily. Development milestones are hitting on time. And conversations around MAGACOINFINANCE are shifting from curiosity to conviction among serious early-stage investors. The project’s growth is happening quietly, strategically, and without artificial hype—exactly the way major success stories in crypto have unfolded before. MAGACOINFINANCE presents something even rarer: early-stage momentum with wide-open potential. Projects to Watch: Uniswap, Polkadot, and Litecoin Uniswap continues to lead decentralized exchange volume and remains a cornerstone of DeFi infrastructure. Polkadot is building the foundation for true multi-chain interoperability, with parachains offering developers new ways to scale and specialize blockchain use cases. Litecoin , often called the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, maintains a strong role in fast, low-fee peer-to-peer payments across a variety of exchanges and platforms. While all three of these projects are vital to the ecosystem, none offer the pure early-stage growth opportunity that MAGACOINFINANCE brings to the table today. Conclusion Crypto’s biggest success stories come from recognizing real growth before it becomes the mainstream narrative. Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP are laying strong foundations for the next cycle—but MAGACOINFINANCE.COM could be the hidden gem that delivers the kind of early-stage breakout gains that define generational wealth opportunities. The growth trajectory is being mapped now—the time to move is before the market fully catches on.

WLFI is the decentralized finance (DeFi) backed by President Donald Trump, and the collaboration will see it fast-track blockchain in the country. Strategic Alliance to Drive Crypto Innovation in Pakistan As per the LOI, WLFI will also drive the adoption of stablecoin and DeFi integration across Pakistan. This development comes ahead of the government’s plans to unveil a comprehensive blueprint on cryptocurrency legalization. Notably, the Pakistani author is looking to embrace digital assets and join the region’s financial innovation wave. The country seems to be positioning itself as one of the world’s rising crypto hubs. The LOI was signed at a meeting between WLFI and PCC, and a high-powered delegation represented both parties. On the part of the PCC, notable delegates included the Pakistan Finance Minister, the State Bank of Pakistan Governor, and the CEO of PCC, among others. The WLFI delegation had Zachary Witkoff, son of Steve Witkoff, the United States Special Envoy to the Middle East, Chase Herro, and Zachary Folkman. Crypto Momentum Leverages Pakistan’s Youth Population Speaking on the decision for the move, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb highlighted the country’s youthful population and technology as its greatest assets. He noted that the government is creating investment opportunities in the blockchain economy through such a partnership. Over 64% of Pakistan’s population is below the age of 30. According to data, the country has over 25 million active crypto users and approximately $300 billion worth of crypto transactions annually. Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, maintains that the collaboration with WLFI is strategic. According to Saqib, the move is to empower Pakistan’s youth and ensure the country is well-positioned to take advantage of the future of global finance. WLFI Expands Global Footprint This development signals the growing adoption of digital currency worldwide and reveals how WLFI has been active in the sector. Recently, it added 4.89 million SEI tokens, estimated at $0.775 million, to its holdings as part of a diversification move. Meanwhile, WLFI has secured $250 million from investors as part of its public token sale. The recent collaboration with Pakistan signals its push for global presence.

Led by Jack Mallers of Strike, Twenty One Capital aims to compete directly with MicroStrategy by employing a strategy of issuing stock to buy Bitcoin, leveraging convertible debt and a reflexive flywheel model. The company plans to accumulate Bitcoin at scale through a global alliance and is preparing to go public via a SPAC backed by Cantor Fitzgerald. This move signals a shift in Bitcoin investment focus from grassroots to Wall Street, embracing Leveraged Bitcoin Equities (LBE) rather than spot ETFs. Analysts note that the success of this approach depends on maintaining a premium on the stock. The initiative represents a $4 billion head start over MicroStrategy's similar playbook and reflects growing institutional interest in Bitcoin acquisition vehicles.

With timelines flooded and Telegram groups buzzing, the meme coin arena is once again brimming with wild bets and unexpected winners. While big names like Floki Inu and ANDY have carved out their cult followings, there’s another contender stealthily sharpening its claws. One that hasn’t even hit exchanges yet but is already turning heads among presale hunters. Meet the mysterious whiskered wildcard everyone’s whispering about: Troller Cat ($TCAT). Still in whitelist-only mode, Trollercat isn’t just another meme project—it’s a community-powered movement wrapped in internet chaos, Ethereum smarts, and serious viral potential. If you’ve missed past rocket rides like DOGE or SHIB, this could be your redemption arc. Let’s dive into the top 8 meme coins clawing for attention in 2025. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) Troller Cat ($TCAT) is a meme coin born from the legendary art of trolling, and it proudly wears that identity. Rooted in Ethereum, this coin isn’t following meme culture; it’s creating it. With a rich narrative inspired by history’s greatest trolls, Troller Cat is out to claw its way to the top with clever marketing, meme mastery, and a rabidly engaged community. While most meme coins lean heavily on hype alone, Troller Cat brings layers of humor, lore, and strategic mischief into its branding. The Trollercat.com whitelist is currently open, and insiders are jumping in before this feline furball takes off. Rumors are circulating about deflationary mechanics tied to a play-to-earn Game Center, which could utilize ad revenue to buy back and burn tokens, thereby reducing the supply while increasing demand. Additionally, early adopters are speculating on lucrative staking rewards reserved for presale participants. Getting in early could be the difference between 10 times and 100 times. Why This Coin Made It to the List: The buzz around Troller Cat isn’t just empty noise—it’s coming from top-tier crypto groups, Twitter alpha threads, and FOMO-filled chats. With the whitelist still open, the chance to pounce before the crowd does is very real. This isn’t a coin you stumble across after it moons—it’s one to get into while the claws are still in stealth mode. 2. Floki Inu ($FLOKI) Floki Inu is no stranger to the spotlight. Born from the Shiba Inu and Dogecoin frenzy, it has since evolved into a powerhouse of its own. With a Viking-themed identity and a roadmap that includes a metaverse game (Valhalla), educational platform (Floki University), and DeFi utilities, Floki Inu offers more than just meme power—it delivers layered ecosystem potential. Why This Coin Made the List: Floki Inu combines meme appeal with a dedicated development team and tangible progress. The coin’s aggressive marketing, large community, and steady development mean it’s still on investors’ radars heading into 2025. 3. ANDY ($ANDY) ANDY is the meme coin that thrives on unpredictability. With a playful branding style and an anti-establishment vibe, it has built a cult following on social media. Its appeal lies in its raw meme energy, unfiltered communication, and ability to generate virality seemingly out of nowhere. Why This Coin Made It to the List: ANDY’s ability to punch above its weight in visibility makes it a consistent wildcard in the meme coin race. For investors who missed out on early DOGE or PEPE runs, ANDY still offers a shot at a meme-fueled pump. 4. Degen ($DEGEN) DEGEN lives up to its name—embracing the chaotic, high-risk-high-reward world of meme trading. It appeals to traders who wear their degeneracy as a badge of honor. With humor, sarcasm, and full embrace of crypto madness, DEGEN has secured a strong niche. Why This Coin Made It to the List: DEGEN’s branding and vibe resonate strongly with Gen-Z and millennial investors who love the thrill of the meme market. Its consistent engagement and wild price swings keep it relevant. 5. Dogs ($DOGS) Dogs is the no-nonsense, all-fun meme coin that rounds up every dog-themed token vibe into one community-driven project. It taps into nostalgia and meme history with a lighthearted approach, encouraging holders to bark, bite, and band together. Why This Coin Made It to the List: With meme projects, community is king—and Dogs has a loud, loyal pack. Its simplicity is part of the charm, making it an easy pick for meme coin explorers. 6. Apu Apustaja ($APU) Apu Apustaja is inspired by the wholesome and meme-worthy frog character from early internet culture. Beyond its comedic appeal, the coin has built a social impact narrative, funding community causes and tying humor to responsibility. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Apu stands out for blending memes with meaning. In a sea of chaos, its community-driven mission and nostalgic value offer unique appeal. 7. Gigachad ($GIGA) Gigachad leans into alpha energy like no other. With meme stylings focused on masculinity, dominance, and over-the-top aesthetics, it has carved out a niche for itself as the go-to coin for meme muscle. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Gigachad’s ability to go viral repeatedly, thanks to its meme fuel and edgy humor, keeps it in the conversation, especially among younger investors seeking high-octane hype. 8. Brett ($BRETT) Brett is a spin-off meme coin that taps into Bro culture and cartoon satire, leveraging internet absurdity to keep eyeballs glued. With high engagement on social media and a mascot that embodies Gen-Z energy, it’s a favorite among meme enthusiasts. Why This Coin Made the List: Its humor-driven vibe and creative memes make it a standout project. Brett’s brand personality helps it stand out from more generic meme clones. Conclusion: Based on the latest research, these are the top meme coins to buy before 2025: Troller Cat, Floki Inu, ANDY, Degen, Dogs, Apu Apustaja, Gigachad, and Brett. Each of these coins has its own style, story, and strategy—but only one is still in whitelist mode and stirring up real presale buzz. Troller Cat (TCAT) isn’t just purring—it’s prowling for dominance. With rumors of a deflationary Game Center, early staking rewards, and lore-fueled branding, this feline’s presale might be the most underestimated move in meme coin land. For those seeking the next potential 100x play, the Trollercat.com whitelist could be the opportunity to get in before the herd. Don’t get caught chasing the tail—join the pack while this cat’s still in stealth.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has shown a strong footing over the last 72 hours, even as the stock market and the traditionally stable bond market continue to exhibit erratic patterns. Bitcoin’s latest bull move has propelled the major digital currency’s total market capitalization above $1.87 trillion, and a 11.6% spike in weekly trading volume has been witnessed. The premier digital asset has risen strongly from its April lows of around $75,000 and is now 25% higher from that level, showing strong gains despite the overall gloomy outlook. Stocks Fall, Gold and BTC Rise Bitcoin has long been touted as a valid store of value alongside Gold. Its safe haven reputation has strengthened over time and was on display during the last few weeks as the world grappled with US President Donald Trump’s global tariff wars. Here is an interesting CNBC infographic: While both BTC and Gold have performed well this month, stocks continue to suffer due to ongoing uncertainty in traditional markets. In addition to the stock market, US government bonds are also facing some selling pressure. These U.S. Treasury securities have historically been considered among the safest investments, with steady interest rate returns. However, for the first time, these payments are expected to surpass the US government’s defense spending, which highlights the pressure on the American economy. There has been some selling in the bond market, which has alarmed economists in the US and around the world, and has stopped Trump from firing the head of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, following a dispute on interest rates. If the bonds fall further, we could face a major financial crunch immediately, as it indicates that trust in the US government is declining quickly. ETFs Record Major Inflows In addition to crypto exchange volumes, major US-based Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) also experienced significant net inflows after a long time. In total, the 11 ETFs had $381 million in net inflows on Monday and a massive $912 million on Tuesday, showing a sharp uptick in institutional activity. Altcoins Respond This string of positive developments has reignited the crypto market, and there are hopes that the long-term bull market of 2024-2025 will resume in the near future, following several months of a bearish outlook. The rest of the coin market also experienced healthy gains as it followed BTC into short-term bullish territory. Major gainers included Ethereum (ETH, 10%), Ripple (XRP, 8%), Solana (SOL, 8%), Dogecoin (DOGE, 11%), Cardano (ADA, 10%), and Sui (SUI, 23%).",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-26 22:25:42

Senator Tim Scott praised the move as a reversal of “harmful Biden-era guidance.” Related: Saylor Declares Victory as Fed Removes Major Hurdle Between Banks & Bitcoin However, Senator Cynthia Lummis offered a more cautious take.

The biggest success stories often start with small, calculated moves—and right now, a $750 investment could be the starting point for the next big narrative. As Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP continue their upward momentum, another name is starting to emerge alongside them: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . It’s not just about which assets are performing—it’s about which ones are still early enough to matter for those seeking exponential returns. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quickly Becoming a Top Early-Stage Focus The window to find undervalued projects is never open for long. And right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is attracting the kind of serious investor attention that suggests something bigger is brewing. This isn’t another flash-in-the-pan token. It’s a structured, steadily expanding project. Wallet activity is climbing. Community engagement is real. And most importantly, the project’s momentum is building organically—without relying on cheap tricks or forced marketing. When Bitcoin was early, when Solana was still overlooked, it was quiet traction like this that signaled bigger moves ahead. Other Noteworthy Names: Uniswap, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin Uniswap remains the leading decentralized exchange protocol, offering unmatched liquidity and consistent usage across DeFi applications. Polkadot continues to push interoperability forward, linking blockchains together through its innovative parachain model. Bitcoin Cash still finds support among those looking for fast, low-cost peer-to-peer transactions, staying true to crypto’s original payment ethos. Litecoin remains a reliable, battle-tested altcoin for simple, efficient transfers across global platforms. These projects provide solid infrastructure—but MAGACOINFINANCE still carries the rare advantage of being undiscovered by the masses. Final Word Can $750 turn into $1.5 million? History has shown it’s possible—but only for those who move early on projects with real growth engines. With XRP , Solana , and Bitcoin continuing to thrive—and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM entering the spotlight—this might be one of those rare moments where smart timing meets major opportunity.

After struggling under $87,000 for the past two months, the flagship cryptocurrency has finally returned above the $90,000 level. It remains unclear whether the recent BTC price surge is a continuation signal for the bull cycle. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that the investor sentiment might be turning positive again, meaning that the Bitcoin bull run could truly be back on. ‘ETF Printer Goes Brrr’ – Crypto Analyst In an April 25 post on the X platform, a crypto analyst with the pseudonym Maartunn shared an on-chain insight into the recent price rally experienced by the world’s largest cryptocurrency. According to the online pundit, the growing appetite of exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors in the past few days might have contributed to the Bitcoin bullish momentum. Related Reading: Litecoin Conviction Remains Strong: More Than 20% Of Supply Frozen Since 5+ Years The relevant indicator here is the Coinbase Premium Gap, which tracks the difference between the Bitcoin price on US-based Coinbase Pro (USD pair) and global Binance exchange (USDT pair). When this difference is positive, it implies BTC is trading at a higher price on Coinbase than on Binance. Typically, a positive Coinbase Premium Gap indicates that US-based investors are purchasing Bitcoin aggressively, especially through ETF issuers that use Coinbase as a liquidity provider. According to data from CryptoQuant, this metric’s 30-hour moving average has stayed positive for more than 265 straight hours (approximately 11 days). Maartunn noted that this is the fifth-longest streak since the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds started trading in January 2024. Typically, a consistently positive Coinbase Premium Gap suggests that US institutional players and large investors are willing to pay above-market prices for Bitcoin — specifically through regulated channels like ETFs or custodial platforms. This prolonged positive streak is historically correlated with positive price action and accumulation phases for the flagship cryptocurrency. Hence, the latest spike in the Coinbase Premium Gap could provide the adequate condition to sustain Bitcoin’s newly-found bullish momentum and perhaps catalyze the next significant breakout. Bitcoin Price At A Glance The price of Bitcoin has climbed above $95,000 for the first time since February, reflecting a 2% increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the premier cryptocurrency has surged by more than 13% in the past seven days.

As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem’s utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform’s adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market’s growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM’s all-time of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2025? Let’s dive into Sonic’s price predictions for 2025 and beyond. Overview Cryptocurrency Sonic Token S Price $0.5389 Market Cap $1.55B Trading Volume $160.99M Circulating Supply 3.17B S All-time High $1.03 on Jan 4, 2025 All-time Low $0.04356 on Jan 29, 2025 24-h High $0.5711 24-h Low $0.5273 Sonic (S) price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 7.71% 50-Day SMA $ 0.504028 14-Day RSI 55.78 Green Days 12/30 (40%) Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 65 (Greed) 200-Day SMA – Sonic price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Sonic shows a cautiously bullish trend on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts with price action testing key resistance Indicators like RSI and MACD support further upward movement while minor selling pressure suggests the need for caution A successful breakout above $0.55 could open the way toward $0.60 but traders should watch for resistance barriers Sonic (S) price analysis 1-day chart Sonic/USD 1-Day Chart Based on the 1-day chart on April 26, Sonic (SONIC) demonstrates a cautiously bullish structure. The price has broken slightly above the midline of the Bollinger Bands, suggesting an attempt to establish upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near 58, indicating growing buying pressure but not yet overbought conditions. Sonic is currently challenging the upper Bollinger Band, and a confirmed breakout above $0.55 could initiate a stronger rally toward $0.60. However, if the momentum weakens, the price might retest the midline support near $0.48. Overall, Sonic’s daily trend points toward cautious optimism with an eye on resistance levels. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart Sonic/USD 4-hour Chart Based on the 4-hour chart, Sonic (SONIC) exhibits moderate bullish momentum. The price is pressing against the Bollinger Bands’ upper boundary, suggesting heightened volatility and strong buying interest. The MACD histogram remains slightly positive, while the MACD and signal lines are close to a bullish crossover, which could reinforce short-term gains. However, the Balance of Power indicator is slightly negative, hinting at some underlying selling pressure. If buyers maintain momentum, Sonic could challenge resistance around $0.56. Conversely, failure to sustain above $0.54 may lead to a correction toward the $0.52 support region.

Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Sonic (SONIC) displays a cautiously bullish outlook. On the 1-day chart, SONIC tests the upper Bollinger Band with an RSI near 58, suggesting strong but not overextended buying momentum. The breakout attempt above $0.55 is crucial for sustained gains. Meanwhile, the 4-hour chart also shows SONIC trading near the upper band, with the MACD signaling a potential bullish crossover. However, the Balance of Power hints at minor selling pressure that could cap gains in the short term. If buying strength continues, SONIC could advance toward $0.60, but caution is warranted around resistance levels. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $1.03 price by 2025 and $6.99 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and an assessment of personal risk tolerance are essential steps for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $5 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $5.39. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic can approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $10. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast that prices could reach between $5.89 and $6.99, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

Hashdex, a Brazilian crypto asset manager, has launched the XRP spot ETF on Brazil’s B3 stock exchange. Brazil Leads With First-Ever Spot XRP ETF XRP is the industry’s fourth most valuable cryptocurrency with a $158 billion market cap as of this writing. But despite its dominance in the cryptosphere, regulatory obstacles have effectively hindered the launch of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) until now. Asset manager Hashdex has launched the Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Fundo de Índice, or Hashdex Nasdaq XRP FI, according to a press release from Valor Econômico. Hashdex received the sign-off from Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) to launch the XRP-based ETF back in February. After the approval by the country’s financial investments regulator, the fund entered into a pre-operational phase. The ETF was undergoing preparatory steps during this time and was not available for trading. Now trading on B3 under the ticker XRPH11, the fund will track the price of XRP across major crypto exchanges using the Nasdaq XRP Reference Price Index. The fund’s approval comes as issuers across the globe aim to address skyrocketing demand for crypto-focused investment products, amid a more friendly regulatory environment for these products and broadening acceptance among retail and institutional investors. Brazil: A Crypto Hub Brazil is notably Latin America’s largest economy, and the third-biggest economy in the Americas after the U.S. and Canada. It is also the region’s most prominent crypto player: Brazil has more Bitcoin ETFs than any other Latin American nation, and many of the country’s major banks offer investors some sort of digital asset exposure. Hashdex currently does not issue a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States, but in December received approval from the SEC for a combo ETF offering investors exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. J.P. Morgan analysts have predicted that, if approved, U.S.-listed funds could gobble between $4 billion and $8 billion in investor money. Spot Bitcoin funds have accrued over $38 billion in net inflows since going live in January 2024. Their Ethereum equivalents have attracted roughly $4 billion in net flows since trading began last July.",Cryptocurrency|News|Brazil|Ripple|USA|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-26 22:34:36

The prominent altcoin has been one of the major headliners of the current market cycle, increasing by 192.70% in the past year. However, certain market technical indicators show that SUI is likely headed for a correction following its most recent explosive gains. Related Reading: SUI Price Soars Despite Overbought RSI – Can The Rally Sustain? Elliott Wave Count Suggests Pullback Looms For SUI In an X post on Friday, X market analytics handle More Crypto Online shared an interesting analysis on the SUI market using the Elliott Wave theory — a technical tool that predicts future price trends by recognizing recurring wave-like patterns. According to the analysts at More Crypto Online, SUI’s bullish performance in the past week means the altcoin has surged to the 178.6% Fibonacci extension level around $3.71. This specified Fibonacci level represents a major technical milestone as it is a classic target area in Wave 3 in the Elliott Wave analysis. For context, the Elliott Wave theory postulates that price movements occur in five recurring wave patterns. Wave 3 is usually regarded as the strongest and longest wave in a bullish trend. It is a wave of confirmation indicating a robust market participation. Based on the current wave count in the SUI market, the altcoin is completing the final stages of Wave 3, having surpassed the minimum Fibonacci extension level of 138%. As expected, signs of waning demand are beginning to set in, as indicated by a 5.7% price retracement in the past day. More Crypto Online predicts Wave 4 — a corrective price phase may now be imminent. SUI is expected to experience a price pullback with initial support zone set at $3.27. Notably, a decisive price break below this level would confirm the end of Wave 3 and the beginning of Wave 4. Furthermore, a deeper market support lies between $2.95 and $2.75, which represents the 38.2% – 50% Fibonacci retracement zone of the Wave 3 move. More Crypto Online views this price region as the support target zone for a healthy Wave 4 correction. Therefore, market bulls must hold this price zone to retain SUI’s bullish structure and set the stage for a potential Wave 5 breakout. SUI Price Outlook At press time, SUI trades at $3.58 following an 8.85% overall gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the coin’s daily trading volume is up by 18.64% and valued at $3.44 billion. If SUI’s price retracement continues, the altcoin is expected to trigger Wave 4 of its current wave cycle, indicating a potential 50% correction lies ahead. However, if bullish momentum remains intact, SUI could rise to around the 200% Fibonacci extension level, around $3.99, which represents the coin’s next major resistance.

On Thursday, the South Korean crypto exchange giant Bithumb announced it was listing XYO, the native token of the XYO Network. The XYO Network aims to process any type of decentralized data. Explains the project’s website , “Encompassing both a network and protocol, XYO can be used for aggregating, verifying, organizing, and utilizing decentralized data from any hardware node capable of running XYO-enabled software or firmware. XYO’s defining premise is decentralized verification, allowing network devices to verify the data flowing into the network’s databases by acting as witnesses for one another, strengthening the veracity of data received. Simple, accessible organization then allows this data to be put to use quickly and efficiently.” Earlier this month, the project announced it would be migrating its network to a new layer-1 chain focused on DePIN. To help facilitate that move, the XYO Network is also rolling out a new layer-1 native token, XL1, and will operate with a dual-token model going forward. The original XYO token will stay on Ethereum ( ETH ) and act “as an anchor to regulate the flow of XL1 into its native blockchain,” according to the project . XYO is trading at $0.0154 at time of writing. The 278th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is also up by more than 71% in the past week.

Today, Bitcoin (BTC) , Solana (SOL) , and XRP remain strong across major exchanges—but sharp investors are expanding their focus toward rising early-stage projects. Among the most discussed right now is MAGACOINFINANCE —an asset building real traction ahead of broader market visibility. Early accumulation phases like this often define the top winners of the next cycle. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing Strong ROI Potential Momentum around MAGACOINFINANCE is growing steadily—driven by real wallet expansion, organic community building, and strategic rollout timing. Based on analyst tracking of stealth-phase growth, projections now suggest MAGACOINFINANCE could deliver a potential upside as listings expand and broader exposure kicks in. This rare positioning is what smart investors target before prices adjust to reflect full market interest. Other Noteworthy Movers: XRP, SOL, KAS, and OP XRP continues solidifying its dominance in digital payments and global remittance channels. Solana (SOL) leads innovation with high-speed, low-cost decentralized finance solutions. Kaspa (KAS) is redefining blockchain scalability with blockDAG technology. Optimism (OP) scales Ethereum infrastructure through Layer-2 efficiency and performance. While these assets are already well-integrated, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the stealth-phase potential where outsized returns are still in reach for early movers. Final Word Crypto rewards those who spot strength before the headlines do. While Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP continue reinforcing their place in the ecosystem, MAGACOINFINANCE is setting up quietly—and those positioned now could be in for some of 2025’s biggest rewards.

In the midst of this, a new project is building serious momentum under the radar, MAGACOINFINANCE . A token that many early investors are now ranking among their top early-stage picks for 2025. The combination of timing, structure, and momentum is creating a setup too compelling to ignore. Why MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining strategic attention The bonus window is still open: Early participants have a short window to maximize their entry before public listings arrive. Momentum is quietly accelerating: Early communities are adding MAGACOINFINANCE to watchlists and positioning early. Pre-listing access remains rare: True low-exposure opportunities like this don’t stay hidden for long. Smart timing is key: This is the exact phase where major crypto stories quietly begin. MAGACOINFINANCE is showing strong growth potential With structured rollout strategies and rising early interest, MAGACOINFINANCE is being flagged by analysts as one of the most promising early-stage projects. Current projections place MAGACOINFINANCE among assets with upswing potential , based on its early phase traction, structural design, and upcoming exposure. Why LINK, DOT, MATIC, and ADA can’t match this early positioning Chainlink (LINK) , Polkadot (DOT) , Polygon (MATIC) , and Cardano (ADA) are key players, but their early-stage moments are behind them. MAGACOINFINANCE is just getting started—where strategic entries still have room for expansion and true scalability. Final thoughts on MAGACOINFINANCE The biggest moves in crypto were made before they became headlines. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP rewarded early conviction. Today, MAGACOINFINANCE is offering the same rare timing opportunity—limited access, growing strength, and strong projected upside. This is the type of early positioning smart investors wait for.

In the crypto market two projects are fighting for leadership yet only one will lead the market in 2025. Mutuum Finance introduces its ongoing phase 4 for $0.025 entry which guarantees a 140% profit when MUTM launches. The steady increase of Cardano depends on its continuous ecosystem development. The dual forces of DeFi innovation and blockchain veteran experience will create a dramatic competition for the year 2025. Cardano’s Methodical March ADA has demonstrated strong market gains by lifting its price 14.99% to $0.69 throughout the week. The mass purchase of millions of tokens by Whale wallets demonstrates their conviction about its future prospects. Two technical indicators show bullish momentum for the market because the 1.06 long-to-short ratio exists alongside an RSI that keeps rising to 57. The combination of BitcoinOS security measures with Bitcoin staking capabilities establishes conditions to attract billions in assets. The systematic engineering approach of Cardano based on peer-reviewed standards counts as a major constraint to its immediate market performance. Modern whales conducted a buy of 180 million tokens which indicates potential profit returns. Cardano faces the possibility of trailing behind in its market ascent toward $0.80 despite analyst predictions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates at full speed as it pushes aggressively through its presale process. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Power The presale stage of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently exists in stage 4 of its 11-phase framework where tokens are sold at $0.025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts intense buyer demand as it collects $7.2 million from 9,100 investors through its presale launch. Phase 5 of the sale will occur soon as the current pricing will increase by 20% to $0.03 thus providing instant profits to early buyers. Tokenomics guarantees an initial pricing at $0.06 which provides 140% return during launch. Directed analysis indicates the launch value will skyrocket to $2.50 and result in a 9,900% growth over current market value. The team is finalizing a Certik audit of its smart contracts, with results soon to be shared on socials, boosting trust. This momentum positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a DeFi frontrunner. Innovative Lending Model One key decentralized feature of MUTM provides a unique framework for loans along with the accruing interest system that mtTokens generate from fund deposits which serves as passive income sources. Through the buy-and-distribute system platform revenue provides repurchased tokens to participants as rewards that occur while market demand remains unaltered. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an updated tracking system which awards additional tokens to the top 50 token owners to strengthen their loyalty together with their rank positions. Mutuum Finance displays different operational features than the extensive blockchain development structure of Cardano. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gains rapid growth in 2025 because investors choose its return on investment offerings and financial strategy which builds community engagement. Race to the Top Mutuum Finance (MUTM) surpasses Cardano (ADA) in terms of fast presale completion as investors easily find profitable ways to invest. The price stability of Cardano maintains itself through ongoing platform development although the network expands its ecosystem continually. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s $0.025 entry, 140% launch profit, and potential $2.50 post-launch value offer unmatched upside. Those seeking 2025’s top-performing asset should move swiftly since Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will finish its phase 4 within this year.

Interestingly, Ethereum has held its ground firmly, supported by a clean uptrend that began after the sharp recovery from $1,550 that kicked off on Tuesday. Related Reading: Ethereum To Hit $5k Before Its 10th Birthday, Justin Sun Says As it stands, the Ethereum price is at an important technical phase after retesting the $1,799 resistance level and pulling back into its final intraday support zone. A fresh push above $1,800 could open the door to $1,840 and beyond, whereas deeper retracements would test three important zones. Ethereum Turns Resistance Levels Into Support Ethereum’s recent rally has seen it break past three notable resistance levels that have rejected its price action for most of April. Interestingly, these resistance levels are located at $1,590, $1,654, and $1,703, as indicated by a technical analysis of Ethereum’s price action on the hourly candlestick timeframe chart on the TradingView platform. Following these breakouts, Ethereum continued to push upward with momentum until it encountered a tougher ceiling near the $1,800 mark. After briefly tapping into this zone, the price experienced a minor rejection, retracing back towards $1,730 before finding support and beginning another gradual climb. As it stands, the resistance at $1,800 is the next level to beat in the hopes of a close above $2,000 before the end of April. Nonetheless, even if Ethereum does not reach this level, a bullish sentiment will still be in place if it manages to hold above the broken resistances, which have now turned to support on the H1 timeframe. Ethereum Could Still Be Bullish Unless $1,654 Breaks Ethereum’s outlook remains bullish as long as the newly reclaimed levels at $1,590, $1,654, and $1,703 continue to act as reliable support zones. The first zone, positioned at $1,703, represents a short-term hourly support level. This area may attract early entries, but it is high-risk and prone to breaking easily. Beneath that lies the more structurally significant support at $1,654, which is also evident on the 4-hour chart. This level is a medium-risk zone, characterized by a cleaner and sound area of demand. It has a higher probability of initiating a bounce if tested, and its preservation is important in maintaining a short-term bullish bias for Ethereum. The strongest support level is at $1,590 and is somewhat low-risk for reentry. It has the most favorable risk-to-reward ratio, where smart money traders are likely to accumulate. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Heating Up’ – Address Activity Jumps Nearly 10% In 2 Days As long as Ethereum stays above $1,703, the current uptrend remains valid. The bullish bias remains intact unless there’s a confirmed break below $1,654. A drop below the $1,654 support would shift the short-term outlook to neutral or bearish. On the other hand, a successful close above $1,800 could cascade toward the next target around $1,840 or even higher.

In 2025, the market is hotter than ever, with new coins emerging every day. However, even with all the noise surrounding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the many altcoins, one thing is crystal clear: many missed the boat on some of the biggest crypto opportunities. Bitcoin’s price is through the roof, and Ethereum’s smart contracts are reshaping industries. But here’s the catch—these opportunities are long gone. Now, the race is on for the next breakout star. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), the cryptocurrency that might just be the next big thing to revolutionize the space. While Bitcoin once looked like the holy grail for early adopters, its massive price tag today makes it less accessible for new users. Ethereum’s gas fees? Don’t get me started. What if there was a new cryptocurrency that could solve the problems these older coins couldn’t? What if it’s still affordable to jump in now, before it becomes the next multi-billion-dollar success story? With Qubetics, that’s exactly what’s on the table. The Missed Opportunity: Bitcoin’s Meteoric Rise Looking back at Bitcoin, it’s hard not to feel a little bit of regret. Bitcoin was once just a quirky, niche project that not many folks took seriously. Fast forward a decade, and it’s the king of cryptocurrencies. Those who jumped in early have seen returns so wild that it’s almost hard to believe. But for the rest, Bitcoin’s skyrocketing price means that entering the game now feels like an impossible task. Let’s face it: Bitcoin’s rise was a missed opportunity for many. But here’s the kicker—it’s not too late to catch the next big wave. Bitcoin might have been the first, but that doesn’t mean it’s the only chance to make it big in crypto. The space is constantly evolving, and new players are stepping up. Qubetics is one of them, and right now, it’s in presale, meaning there’s still time to get in on the ground floor. Bitcoin is often referred to as the “most popular cryptocurrency,” and for good reason. It’s the leader in terms of market cap and adoption, but its limitations are clear. High transaction costs, slow processing times, and an energy-hungry proof-of-work mechanism make Bitcoin’s future uncertain in the face of more scalable and eco-friendly alternatives. That’s where Qubetics comes into play. Why Qubetics is the New Rising Star of the Crypto Space The most popular cryptocurrency of 2025 might not be the one you think. Sure, Bitcoin and Ethereum are still heavyweights, but the next wave of crypto adoption is already underway, and Qubetics is leading the charge. Why? Because it’s addressing the real-life problems that current cryptocurrencies are struggling with. Qubetics has introduced a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet that allows users to manage assets across different blockchain networks, offering true decentralized control. Unlike traditional custodial wallets that hold your assets for you, Qubetics lets users stay in control of their own funds. And with the ability to interact with multiple chains, it’s bridging gaps that Bitcoin and Ethereum have failed to address. Real-Life Applications of Qubetics: A Game-Changer for Businesses, Professionals, and Individuals Let’s talk about how Qubetics could change lives—real lives. Imagine you’re a small business owner looking to accept payments in cryptocurrency. You don’t want the hassle of paying crazy high fees to process payments through Ethereum or Bitcoin. With Qubetics, you could accept payments on multiple blockchains with low fees, all while maintaining full control over your funds. Now, picture a professional freelancer who works with clients from all over the world. With Qubetics, they can easily send and receive payments across different networks, without worrying about excessive transaction costs or delays. That’s huge for anyone working in the gig economy or running a digital business. Whether you’re a designer, a consultant, or a digital marketer, Qubetics makes it easy to manage payments securely and efficiently. And let’s not forget about everyday users. The Qubetics wallet allows for seamless transactions across multiple blockchains, meaning users can send crypto with ease, whether it’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other assets. All of this comes with a level of security that most other wallets can’t provide. The Qubetics Presale: Get in Before It’s Too Late So, how can you take advantage of this opportunity? Well, the Qubetics presale is in full swing, and right now, you can purchase $TICS tokens for just $0.1902 per token in the 31st stage. Over 25,200 holders have already jumped in, raising more than $16.4 million. Analysts are predicting massive returns once the crypto presale ends and the token hits exchanges. Some are even predicting that the price could hit $1, $5, or even $15 after the mainnet launch. That’s a potential return of over 7,000% from the presale price! Here’s a breakdown of the price predictions: $TICS at $1 after the presale = 425% ROI $TICS at $5 after the presale = 2527% ROI $TICS at $15 after mainnet launch = 7783% ROI This is an opportunity that won’t last long. With the presale in its final stages, now’s the time to act if you want to get in before it’s too late. What’s Next for Qubetics? Analysts are extremely bullish on Qubetics, and it’s easy to see why. With a clear roadmap, an innovative multi-chain wallet, and a rapidly growing community, Qubetics is poised to make a major impact in the crypto space. Its presale success speaks volumes about the excitement and interest surrounding the project. The Qubetics community continues to grow, and as the mainnet launch approaches, the price of $TICS is expected to soar. If you missed the boat with Bitcoin or Ethereum, now’s your chance to get in early on the next big cryptocurrency. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Next Most Popular Cryptocurrency—Qubetics Looking back at the rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum, it’s easy to feel a little regretful for not getting in early. These coins were the most popular cryptocurrency of their time, and their meteoric rise made fortunes for many. But here’s the thing—just because you missed the boat on Bitcoin doesn’t mean you’re out of luck. Qubetics ($TICS) is the next big opportunity in crypto, and it’s still in presale, making it a perfect chance to get in before it becomes the next most popular cryptocurrency. With its innovative Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, low fees, and massive potential for growth, Qubetics has all the makings of a breakout star. Analysts are predicting huge returns, and with the presale gaining momentum, the time to act is now. If you missed out on Bitcoin or Ethereum, don’t let this opportunity pass you by.

Right now, that window may be opening across several major names—including MAGACOINFINANCE.COM , XRP , Solana , and Bitcoin —all of which are building undeniable momentum as 2025 approaches. In markets like these, small moves can turn into major outcomes—and the clock is ticking for those looking to position themselves before the next surge hits. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Speed—and Serious Investors Are Noticing Momentum in crypto isn’t random. It’s built on clear signals: growing wallet numbers, consistent project updates, expanding community support, and increased mentions across credible trader circles. Right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is showing all of those signals—and it’s doing so faster than most new tokens even hope to. It’s clear, it’s early, and the foundation being built is earning attention from seasoned investors who know what early-stage traction looks like. No gimmicks. No overhype. Just execution and a community that’s growing stronger with every new development. Why XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin Are Still Leading Conversations XRP has returned as a serious force in global payments, now with legal clarity boosting its ability to integrate with financial institutions. As cross-border remittance demand grows, XRP’s value proposition becomes even more critical. Solana remains unmatched in transaction speed and network scalability. With NFT ecosystems, gaming platforms, and real-world integrations accelerating, it continues to be a key player in every major crypto growth discussion. Bitcoin , the foundation of the digital asset class, keeps asserting its dominance. Institutions continue to build exposure, and retail traders still treat it as the safest macro bet in crypto. Other Rising Players: NEAR Protocol, Chainlink, Ethereum, and Aave NEAR Protocol continues to make waves with its user-friendly blockchain model, onboarding developers who are focused on seamless dApp creation. Chainlink remains a pillar of decentralized data. Its oracles power a huge segment of DePIN and on-chain asset management, keeping it absolutely essential to the ecosystem. Ethereum is the backbone of innovation. Despite Layer-2 competition, its centrality to smart contracts and DeFi ensures its continued relevance for the foreseeable future. Aave is leading decentralized lending and liquidity platforms, offering secure, innovative tools for both retail and institutional DeFi users. Each is valuable—but none are in the early-stage growth zone where MAGACOINFINANCE now thrives. Final Word $8,000 in 20 days? Crypto history shows that fast momentum can spark fast outcomes—but only for those positioned early. With MAGACOINFINANCE.COM , XRP , Solana , and Bitcoin all gaining strength, the smartest move might be stepping into the right assets before the next leg up. The momentum is already here.

After weeks of consolidation and choppy price action, POL has decisively moved above the pattern’s resistance line, breathing life back into its short-term outlook. The current momentum suggests that bulls may have their eyes set on the next key target at $0.31. With improving sentiment and technical indicators flashing bullish signals, POL appears poised to extend its recovery if buyers can sustain the pressure. From Consolidation To Acceleration: Polygon Phase Shifts In a recent tweet, Whales_Crypto_Trading highlighted a significant technical move on POL’s chart. Polygon is currently breaking above the upper boundary of a broadening wedge on the daily timeframe, which is usually a bullish signal that points to rising volatility and potential trend reversal. This pattern, widely watched by technical traders, suggests that POL may be gearing up for a sustained upside push. Related Reading: Nearly All POL Holders At A Loss—What Does It Mean For The Market? The analyst further noted that if momentum continues to build, POL could see a notable move toward the $0.52 mark. This level represents a midterm projection based on the size of the breakout from the wedge formation. A 2x gain from current levels would attract bullish attention and position POL back in line with previous consolidation zones. With the breakout accompanied by improving sentiment and growing volume, Polygon appears to be setting the stage for a stronger rally. Presently, speculations are whether bulls can maintain the price above the breakout level and continue defending short-term support. If that happens, POL’s next chapter could be defined by renewed momentum and wider investor interest. Measured Moves And Extended Targets While $0.31 stands as the immediate upside target following the breakout, the broadening wedge pattern hints that the Polygon rally may not stop there. Breakouts from such structures often extend beyond initial resistance zones, especially when supported by strong volume and positive momentum indicators. Related Reading: Polygon Q4 Digest: Agglayer Testnet Launch Drives 30% Spike In POL Market Cap If bullish pressure remains steady, the next areas to watch would be near $0.44 and $0.52, both of which align with previous reaction points and Fibonacci extensions. These levels could act as zones where short-term traders might take profits, but they also offer opportunities for the trend to build new higher highs. Despite the upward momentum surrounding POL’s breakout, risks still linger beneath the surface. One major concern is the possibility of a false breakout if the price fails to hold above the $0.31 mark, attracting strong selling pressure and trapping late buyers. This would invalidate the breakout and may trigger a swift pullback toward lower support levels.

With its recent break in tight price action, a crypto analyst believes that XRP could be preparing to surge above $8, marking a new ATH for the top altcoin. XRP Price Aims For $8 Target In Coming Months After months of constrained price action, the XRP price has finally broken out of a descending consolidation pattern—a bullish signal that the market has been eagerly awaiting. Following this breakout, XRP is now eyeing a potential rally toward the $8.08 mark. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Heating Up’ – Address Activity Jumps Nearly 10% In 2 Days Delving deeper into the technical chart analysis published by TradingView crypto analyst Master Ananda, XRP is now comfortably trading above crucial Moving Averages (MA), including the EMA9, EMA10, EMA20, EMA25, EMA50, and most importantly, the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The Exponential Moving Averages indicate a short to medium-term bullishness for XRP. At the same time, the 200-day SMA is the most critical and long-term bullish signal. Key Fibonacci Extension levels confirm the breakout from the descending consolidation pattern. In alignment with its projected rise to $8.08, XRP is expected to surge past three critical price targets: the 1.618 Fib at $4.5, the 2.618 Fib around $6.29 and finally, the 3.618 Fib, which corresponds with the $8.08 price level. Notably, a surge to $8.08 would represent more than double XRP’s current all-time high of $3.84, marking a 1,380% increase from its current market value. The analyst’s chart highlights a clear breakout trajectory, emphasizing a steady upward pace with the reversal point already confirmed. For its short-term price targets, Master Ananda has shared four key Fibonacci Extension levels: the 0.382 Fib at $2.29, the 0.5 Fib at $2.5, the 0.618 Fib at $2.71, and finally, the 0.786 Fib at $3.01. Notably, the analyst has also highlighted the $3.4 level as a “high” resistance level for XRP. Breaking above this price would be another huge bullish confirmation that XRP can move toward the $8.08 projected target. Analyst: Exercise Patience Ahead Of Surge Despite his bullish stance on XRP’s future price outlook, Master Ananda has advised investors and traders to remain patient and exercise caution. While XRP is showing clear signs of growth, it’s important to note that this projected surge will not happen overnight. The TradingView analyst has stated that XRP’s journey toward the price range between $6-$8 would span several months, not just weeks, as the market gradually stabilizes and bullish momentum continues to build. Related Reading: Ethereum To Hit $5k Before Its 10th Birthday, Justin Sun Says Although market volatility could still test XRP’s price action, the breakout from the SMA200 confirms that the cryptocurrency has entered a multi-month bullish phase.

Listings are approaching quickly: With broader exposure coming soon, private entry won’t stay exclusive. Strategic demand is growing: Private groups and analyst networks are moving quietly before public awareness spikes. Timing is crucial: Those positioned now are locking in the phase where the biggest returns are built. MAGACOINFINANCE is positioned for powerful ROI Analyst forecasts surrounding MAGACOINFINANCE are rising fast—and for good reason. Current sentiment places MAGACOINFINANCE on track for a potential breakout among the leading altcoins of 2025 , with models suggesting that early investors could capitalize on explosive expansion once public trading and broader market attention begin. The fundamentals are clear: strong mechanics, smart rollout, and true scalability potential. Why DOT, ADA, INJ, and KAS aren’t at the same entry phase Polkadot (DOT) , Cardano (ADA) , Injective (INJ) , and Kaspa (KAS) are respected, but their earliest growth windows have passed. MAGACOINFINANCE still offers rare stealth positioning—where upside is built by timing, not by following the crowd. Final thoughts on MAGACOINFINANCE Every market cycle rewards early action.

We need to turn on the lights and build some walkways over the lava pit,” Peirce said at the SEC “Know Your Custodian” roundtable event on April 25. The lava is crypto, says Peirce Peirce explained that SEC registrants are forced to approach crypto-related activities like “the floor is lava,” where the aim is to jump from one piece of furniture to the next without touching the ground, except here, touching crypto directly is the lava. “A D.C. version of this game is our regulatory approach to crypto assets, and crypto asset custody in particular,” she said. Peirce said that, much like in the game, firms wanting to engage with crypto must avoid directly holding it due to unclear regulatory rules. “To engage in crypto-related activities, SEC-registrants have had to hop from one poorly illuminated regulatory space to the next, all while ensuring that they never touch any crypto asset,” Peirce said. Source: US Securities and Exchange Commission Peirce said that investment advisers are often unsure which crypto assets qualify as securities, what entities count as qualified custodians, and whether “exercising staking or voting rights” could trigger custody violations. “The twist in the regulatory version is that it is largely played in the dark: burning legal lava and no lamps to illuminate the way.” Peirce also said that a broker or ATS that cannot custody or manage crypto assets will struggle to facilitate trading, making it unlikely for a “robust market” to develop. Echoing a similar sentiment, SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said at the event that as more SEC registrants work with crypto assets, it’s essential that they have access to custodial options that meet legal and regulatory requirements. Uyeda said the agency should consider letting advisers use “state-chartered limited-purpose trust companies” with the authority to hold crypto assets as qualified custodians. Related: Blockchain needs regulation, scalability to close AI hiring gap Meanwhile, the recently sworn-in chair of the SEC, Paul Atkins, said that he expected “huge benefits” from blockchain technology through efficiency, risk mitigation, transparency, and cutting costs. He reiterated that among his goals at the SEC would be to facilitate “clear regulatory rules of the road” for digital assets, hinting that the agency under former chair Gary Gensler had contributed to market and regulatory uncertainty. “I look forward to engaging with market participants and working with colleagues in President Trump’s administration and Congress to establish a rational fit-for-purpose framework for crypto assets,” said Atkins.

While the price of BTC continues to hold above the critical $94,000 level, the premier cryptocurrency seems to be losing some momentum. Unsurprisingly, investors appear to be increasingly confident in the promise of this recent rally, as significant amounts of BTC continue to make their way off major centralized exchanges over the past few days. Here’s how much investors have moved in the past few days. Over 35,000 BTC Move Out Of Coinbase And Binance In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, crypto analyst João Wedson revealed that Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has seen increased activity over the past few days. The exchange netflow data shows that huge amounts of Bitcoin have been withdrawn from the platform in recent days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees 4th Dip in Funding Rates This Year — What Does This Mean For BTC? According to CryptoQuant data, a total of 27,750 BTC (worth $2.63 billion at current price) was moved out of Binance on Friday, April 25. This latest round of withdrawals represents the third-largest net outflow in the centralized exchange’s history. The movement of significant crypto amounts from exchanges, which offer services like selling to non-custodial wallets, suggests a potential shift in investor sentiment and strategy. Large exchange outflows often signal increased confidence of holders in the long-term potential of an asset. Wedson noted that the recent outflows do not guarantee a price rally for Bitcoin, but they do signal strong institutional activity, which is often a precursor for major volatility. Citing China’s crypto ban in 2021, the crypto analyst highlighted how massive exchange outflows didn’t prevent the dump. At the same time, Wedson mentioned that the continuous Bitcoin outflows over several days, like during the FTX collapse, preceded a price bottom and the eventual market recovery. Ultimately, the online pundit hinted at paying close attention to the overall trend of the exchange netflow rather than a single-day activity. Similarly, more than 7,000 BTC (worth approximately $66.5 million) have made their way out of the Coinbase exchange. According to the CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha, this negative exchange netflow could be an indicator of increased institutional activity, as Coinbase is known as the primary crypto vendor for US-based institutions. Taha said: These large outflows typically suggest accumulation by institutions or large investors, potentially signaling bullish sentiment. The analyst outlined that if the dwindling exchange reserves correlate with an increased spot demand or ETF inflows, a supply squeeze could be on the horizon, potentially pushing the price to the upside. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just beneath $95,200, reflecting an almost 2% increase in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Is The XRP Price Rally Over At $2.22?

Jacobs said geopolitical tensions and growing global uncertainty are accelerating diversification strategies among central banks in different countries. He pointed to a long-term trend in which nations are reducing their reliance on dollar reserves in favor of assets such as gold and, increasingly, bitcoin. ”This whole diversification away from traditional assets towards gold and cryptocurrencies [...] started three to four years ago,” Jacobs explained, adding that the recent fragmentation of the world has increased the desire for alternative means of saving. The BlackRock representative mentioned growing concerns about the freezing in the West of $300 billion in assets of the Russian central bank. In his view, such events have forced countries such as China to rethink their reserve strategies. Geopolitical fragmentation as a defining force During the interview, Jacobs said that BlackRock has identified multipolarity as a key force that will influence global markets over the next few decades: ”We've really identified geopolitical fragmentation as a key force that will be a global driver over the next few decades.” He noted that this environment is fueling demand for non-correlated stock market assets, with bitcoin increasingly seen alongside gold as a safe haven asset. ”We've seen significant inflows into gold ETFs, we've seen significant inflows into bitcoin. And it's all because people are looking for assets with independent market behavior,” Jacobs said. Bitcoin is separating from the stock market Notably, Jacobs is not the only one to emphasize bitcoin's declining correlation with U.S. stocks. Several analysts have also noted that the first cryptocurrency is starting to separate from the US stock market. On April 22, Alex Svanevik, co-founder and CEO of crypto platform Nansen, stated that the bitcoin price is showing growing maturity as a global asset, becoming ”less Nasdaq and more like gold.” He added that bitcoin has proven ”remarkably resilient” in the face of the trade war compared to altcoins and indices like the S&P 500, although it remains vulnerable to economic recession fears. Echoing that view, QCP Capital in an April 21 report shared gold's fame as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. ”With stock markets ending last week in the red, continuing April's decline, the narrative of bitcoin as a protective asset or inflation hedging tool is gaining traction again. If this momentum continues, it could provide further impetus for institutional bitcoin investment,” summarizes QCP Capital.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-27 05:08:48

Up more than 11% over the last seven days and with a market cap hovering just under $1.88 trillion, BTC has social media ablaze with shouts of $100K+ price predictions, even as some seasoned voices warn retail traders to tread carefully. $103K on the Cards Analyst Titan of Crypto ignited the bullish case, claiming a “bull flag” breakout is underway, and predicting a short-term move to $103,000 in a post on X. The asset’s recent price movement coincided with substantial accumulation by large investors. According to Santiment, wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC have been aggressively adding to their positions, with Bitcoin advocate Kyle Chassé calling it “THE STRONGEST SIGNAL IN THE GAME!!!” Santiment also revealed that market sentiment has reached its most greed-dominated level since November 2024, when the flagship cryptocurrency last peaked before correcting 13%. The analytics platform suggested whales were ready to mop up any BTC offloaded by profit-seeking retail traders in this period, potentially giving the asset a leg up past $100,000: “If they sell here because they think we are seeing a top, whales would likely scoop up those coins and potentially push Bitcoin above $100K in the next 1-2 weeks.” Some prominent market watchers have also highlighted key technical developments, including Daan Crypto Trades, who observed Bitcoin’s resilience at key Fibonacci levels. “$BTC Strong bounce and continuation from the .382 Fibonacci Retracement level,” he stated, expressing his fondness for “higher timeframe trends.” Bull Cycle Incoming? Adding to the narrative, Michaël van de Poppe suggested the market might be entering a major bull cycle. He cited a chart by TechDev_52 showing that BTC has been in its longest bear run, lasting four years, and implied a reverse cycle was imminent. “We’re about to start the biggest bull cycle ever,” the crypto investor wrote. However, the Santiment team offered a more cautious perspective, noting that excessive crowd greed might lead to a local top formation, while more measured behavior could allow BTC to maintain its divergence from traditional markets like the S&P 500. With its dominance holding at 61.2% and institutional interest remaining strong, the cryptocurrency’s next move could set the tone for the rest of the digital asset market in the next week.

Once it breaks into the “Acceleration” zone, the crypto asset enters the rally's 33% to 66% range , progressively targeting $106,000, $130,000, and $163,000 over the next few months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 predicted BTC’s price target could be as high as $200,000 in 2025. The prediction is based on ""Bitcoin power curve time contours,"" which overlay Bitcoin’s price movements across four-year cycles (2013, 2017, 2021, and 2025). The chart suggests a strong performance in Q3 and Q4 of 2025, with the analyst noting that Bitcoin’s historical four-year cycle remains intact. The analyst said, “Looking at two-year segments centered today, 4, 8, and 12 years ago. Price scaling performed using the power curve trendline. Expecting $200,000+ Bitcoin in Q4.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Gold is still leading BTC but has dropped 6% since hitting new highs, while Bitcoin has gained 11%. Cointelegraph reported that BTC tends to follow gold’s directional bias with a lag of 100-150 days. Based on that narrative, it is possible that Bitcoin could lead gold in the coming weeks. Similarly, the US Dollar Index (DXY) dropped to a new three-year low on April 21, which further fueled the likelihood of a rally for risk assets. Cointelegraph reported that multi-year DXY lows have been historically bullish for Bitcoin. Crypto analyst ‘Venture Founder’ also pointed out , “Traditionally, DXY going down is very bullish for $BTC, we now have a massive bearish divergence for DXY, which may suggest it goes to 90.

XForceGlobal, Korea’s first ever certified Elliott Wave analyst, is of the view that the cryptocurrency has entered the completion phase of its correction cycle and now stands ready to go into a big bull run.

The technical pattern has often indicated that a period of a pullback is concluding. The analyst said Wave W was the initial response of the market to profit-taking once XRP had risen six times in price. Wave X momentarily picked up the upward trend with minimal momentum before Wave Y concluded the correction with another orderly downward trajectory. The cryptocurrency fell approximately 50% from its January 2025 peak of $3.33 to a low of $1.638.

The analyst has had a minimum target of $10, which would be a 350% rise from current levels. His upper target of $40 would be an unprecedented 1,726% rise. The prediction relies on Elliott Wave Theory, which tries to foresee market movements through patterns of investor sentiment expressing themselves in price waves. The predictions rely on the strength and expansion of waves 3 and 5 within the overall structure of the market. Korean Markets Act As Leading Indicators XForceGlobal pointed out that Korean cryptocurrency exchanges play a vital role in the prediction of XRP price fluctuations. In the opinion of the analyst, Korean markets have in the past led in the recognition of significant XRP tops and bottoms. The similarity between XRP’s Korean won (KRW) chart and its US dollar chart was highlighted as especially significant. “We’re seeing the same structure on both charts. That adds conviction that wave 2 may be complete,” the analyst said.

Here’s the Next Stop",https://timestabloid.com/expert-outlines-xrp-path-to-1000-heres-the-next-stop/,"BarriC (@B_arri_C), a prominent voice in the cryptocurrency space, has presented a bold forecast for the price of XRP, laying out a staged projection that begins with the asset hitting $3 and culminating in a long-term stabilization at $1,000. The prediction starts with XRP reaching $3 before rising quickly to $5 . According to BarriC, this initial phase would be followed by a surge to the $10–$20 range, driven by the heightened momentum and volatility typically associated with an altcoin season. This progression is portrayed not as a sudden spike but as a sequence of price actions building on broader market dynamics. $XRP starts by hitting $3 Then $XRP skyrockets from $3 to $5 Then as the volatility and momentum of an alt season kicks in $XRP skyrockets to $10-$20 Once we have entered into double digit #XRP territory we may see the market dip back down into a bear market However towards… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) April 24, 2025 The Solution to a Bear Market BarriC suggests that after XRP enters double-digit pricing, the market could retreat into a bear phase. However, the forecast maintains that the broader trajectory remains upward, especially if specific catalysts take shape. One of the critical drivers identified is the institutional adoption of blockchain and XRP by banks. BarriC notes that if this materializes by late 2025, it could set the stage for a dramatic increase in XRP’s valuation, with a potential move to $100 . From there, the projection becomes significantly more ambitious. BarriC envisions a scenario where global financial institutions begin routing substantial volumes of capital through XRP.

The implication is that such institutional utility would fundamentally transform XRP’s market position, reducing volatility and establishing $1,000 as a baseline value. Another crypto expert recently explained why banks will need XRP for liquidity as the global financial system evolves, and he believes this demand could send the asset to $1,000 . BarriC asserts that once the digital asset reaches this stage, the days of price fluctuations and affordable entry points will be over. “Say goodbye to cheap XRP,” he states, arguing that the token would stabilize permanently above the $1,000 level. This outlook hinges on several pivotal developments: the sustained growth of altcoin markets, a return of bullish sentiment following a potential bear phase, and most importantly, widespread institutional endorsement. While the projection remains speculative, it outlines a clearly defined vision for the digital asset and is built on its potential to dominate global finance. The asset is currently trading at $2.19, and now investors are watching out for the next move to the $3-$5 range.

43856172,https://timestabloid.com/?p=65302,1745734785,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,The Road to $100: Here’s What XRP Must Overcome,https://timestabloid.com/the-road-to-100-heres-what-xrp-must-overcome/,"Despite recent growth in the broader cryptocurrency market, XRP has shown weak momentum. While Bitcoin (BTC) has surged over 11% this week, reaching a new high of $94,671 and approaching the $100,000 mark, XRP has only managed a 6.56% gain. It continues to struggle near the $2.21 level, facing persistent resistance and failing to reflect the broader market’s recovery. Nonetheless, some analysts remain optimistic about the token’s long-term potential, with a few projecting the possibility of the asset eventually reaching a price of $100. Could XRP Realistically Hit $100? Although more conservative price targets, such as $10 and $27, appear more plausible soon, some market commentators have suggested that XRP could reach as high as $100 under the right conditions. Last year, crypto analyst Levi Rietveld expressed strong confidence in this outcome, and more recently, analyst BarriC stated that investors may one day be willing to pay $100 per token. However, this projection raises questions about the asset’s potential market capitalization. The asset has a total supply of approximately 99 billion tokens. At $100 per token, this would result in a fully diluted market capitalization of $9.9 trillion, far exceeding Bitcoin’s current valuation of roughly $1.9 trillion and surpassing the entire global crypto market cap, which currently stands around $3 trillion. Such a figure would even overtake the estimated $22 trillion value of all the gold in the world, casting serious doubt on the feasibility of such a high price. Addressing the Supply Barrier One potential path to reducing XRP’s market cap at higher price levels involves decreasing the total token supply. A commonly proposed solution has been the burning of Ripple’s escrow balance, which currently holds around 36.8 billion XRP, according to XRPScan. Burning this stash would reduce the circulating and total potential supply, potentially leading to higher valuations. Still, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has discouraged this approach . He points to the 2019 example of Stellar, which destroyed a portion of its token supply without achieving significant price gains. As such, the effectiveness of supply reduction in boosting price remains uncertain. An alternative idea, discussed within the community, involves donating the escrowed XRP to the U.S. government, following former President Donald Trump’s recent remarks about XRP being included in a national crypto reserve. While symbolically impactful, the practical implications of this action on price dynamics are still unclear. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market Growth as a Key Factor Even with a reduced supply, achieving a $100 valuation for the token would require substantial expansion of the entire cryptocurrency market. If XRP’s total supply were cut to 63 billion tokens and reached $100 per token, the resulting market cap would be $6.3 trillion. For XRP to account for just 6% of the total market, the global crypto market would need to grow to around $113.33 trillion. For comparison, if Bitcoin maintained its current dominance level of about 64.5%, it would command a $73.13 trillion market cap in this scenario. Divided across its 21 million coin supply, this would equate to a BTC price of around $3.4 million. Interestingly, this aligns with a forecast made by VanEck in 2024, which predicted Bitcoin could reach $3 million by 2050. While the notion of XRP reaching $100 is not entirely impossible, it is highly improbable without extraordinary changes in XRP’s tokenomics and the size of the global crypto market. Achieving this goal would require a substantial reduction in supply and unprecedented market growth. Until then, more modest price targets remain the most reasonable expectations for the foreseeable future. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Many altcoins have produced even more painful declines over the past 24 hours, including SOL, DOGE, ADA, and SHIB. BTC Rally Paused It was a great week for the primary cryptocurrency. It began on Monday with a breakout from the short-term upper range boundary at $86,000 that sent BTC above $87,000. The asset continued its run on Tuesday and it finally jumped past $90,000 – for the first time since early March. After a minor retracement, BTC kept climbing and tapped $92,000 on Wednesday. The culmination came on Friday when the bulls really stepped up on the gas pedal and sent the cryptocurrency flying to just shy of $96,000. This became its highest price in exactly two months. The weekend has been a lot calmer , as bitcoin failed to overcome that resistance despite another attempt earlier on Sunday. As of now, though, BTC remains around two grand away from its local peak. Its market capitalization has slipped below $1.870 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 61.3%. BTCUSD.

In contrast, some of yesterday’s top performers, such as PEPE and SHIB, have dropped by well over 5% each. ADA, SOL, DOGE, LINK, AVAX, and XRP are also in the red.

Right now, serious investors are putting their attention on four names that could define the next wave: XRP , Cardano , Bitcoin , and the fast-rising MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . While market leaders continue to perform, it’s the early-stage opportunities like MAGACOINFINANCE that offer the most dramatic potential for wealth creation—and the clock is already ticking. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Moving From Undiscovered to Unmissable Some tokens launch and fade away. MAGACOINFINANCE is doing the opposite—growing stronger every week. Early wallet activity is up. Community momentum is accelerating. And investor circles that usually move carefully are starting to take positions quietly, ahead of wider exposure. It’s not hype—it’s structure, execution, and steadily increasing relevance. The project is behaving exactly the way past winners have behaved in their infancy: consistent communication, strategic expansion, and a user base that isn’t flipping short-term—it’s growing long-term. Other Movers Gaining Traction: Solana, Toncoin, Optimism, and Sei Solana has come back into focus with surging transaction volumes, real-world dApp adoption, and high-speed performance metrics. Toncoin is rapidly carving out a niche in mobile-first blockchain development, offering easy entry points for non-crypto-native users. Optimism continues to lead Ethereum’s Layer-2 scaling push, making transactions cheaper and faster without sacrificing security. Sei is gaining recognition for its performance-first architecture, designed to optimize trading and financial application experiences. Each of these assets is strong—but when it comes to early-stage asymmetrical opportunity, MAGACOINFINANCE is drawing more eyes by the day. Final Word From $777 to $777K? It sounds bold—but in crypto, bold outcomes come from bold early moves. XRP , Cardano , and Bitcoin will continue to anchor serious portfolios. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is giving investors the rare opportunity to move early—before it becomes the next name everyone’s chasing.

The regret of not jumping in early when it was dirt cheap still stings for many in the crypto community. Those who hesitated watched it explode into one of the most talked-about chains of the last few years. If you’ve found yourself haunted by charts that soared without you, you’re definitely not alone. But here’s the kicker—opportunities like that don’t just disappear forever. They reappear in different forms. And right now, another major player might be loading up that rocket, waiting for the next price launch. Enter Qubetics . This isn’t just some overhyped token—it’s designed with utility, real-world application, and scalability baked into its framework. Since launching its presale quietly in late 2024, Qubetics has built serious traction, moving through stage after stage with price hikes that are turning heads. The token is still priced under $0.20, but that’s not going to last much longer. With each stage lasting just 7 days and locking in a fixed 10% price increase, the FOMO is real. Missed Solana? Then don’t sleep on Qubetics—one of the top cryptos to invest in april 2025 while the presale window is still wide open. Qubetics Could Be the Comeback You Needed: One of the Top Cryptos to Invest in April 2025 Let’s be real—if you missed Qubetics at the whitelist price of $0.01, you’re not the only one. That was back in September 2024, and early adopters didn’t even have to drop money upfront to lock in that entry. Since then, the presale has gone through multiple price stages, and right now, it’s sitting at $0.1902 in Stage 31. Over $16.4 million has already been raised, with more than 509 million $TICS sold to a strong base of 25,200+ holders. The presale model is laser-focused: each stage lasts only a week, with a 10% price bump every new round. The Qubetics presale still has room to grow, but time is the only luxury you’re short on. Let’s break it down. A $1,000 investment in Qubetics today would get you 5,256 tokens. If $TICS hits just $1 post-mainnet, that’s $5,255.90—already a 425.53% return. But if it reaches $5, you’re sitting on $26,279.50. At $10, that shoots to $52,558.90. And if you’re in it for the long haul? A $15 valuation turns that initial $1,000 into a jaw-dropping $78,838.50. Those numbers aren’t pipe dreams—they’re grounded in Qubetics’ development timeline, with the mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025 and over 12.85% of its total supply set aside for the community through the presale. That’s what makes this one of the top cryptos to invest in april 2025—because the current stage still offers affordability paired with real upside. So what makes Qubetics different from other presales that fizzle out post-launch? One word: interoperability. Qubetics isn’t building another siloed blockchain. It’s solving one of crypto’s biggest headaches—making networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin actually communicate in a decentralized, frictionless way. Think of a freelance developer working across multiple platforms, or a gaming company wanting to bridge NFTs from one ecosystem to another without extra gas fees or centralization bottlenecks. Qubetics allows seamless data, asset, and transaction transfer across chains, with validators selected through Delegated Proof of Stake to keep things quick and secure. Businesses can now tap into multiple chains through a single interface, unlocking performance, utility, and cost efficiency. From DeFi to real estate, that use case alone puts Qubetics among the top cryptos to invest in april 2025 . Solana’s Moon Mission: You Blinked, It Launched Solana is the classic “you should’ve bought when…” story. Launched in 2020 with an ICO price of just $0.22, it didn’t take long before it made its mark. By November 2021, it had reached an all-time high of $260+—an absolutely insane return for early community members. The ones who believed in Solana’s vision of ultra-fast, low-fee transactions backed by proof-of-history tech didn’t just ride a wave—they practically surfed through one of the most profitable chapters in crypto history. And the irony? Many watched from the sidelines, too skeptical to move while it was under $5. What separates Solana from other chains is how it disrupted Ethereum’s dominance in transaction throughput and developer activity. NFTs, DeFi apps, Web3 games—all found fertile ground on Solana, backed by its speed and low gas fees. The growth was so rapid that even outages and criticism couldn’t hold it back for long. Solana has now cemented its position in the top tier, with a community that spans institutional partners, developers, and high-volume dApps. But if you’re looking at Solana now, you’re probably thinking, “Well, it’s already made its run.” And you’re right—it’s not early-stage anymore. The boat hasn’t just left the dock—it’s halfway across the ocean. That’s exactly why looking into the top cryptos to invest in april 2025 like Qubetics is the move that can rewrite your crypto story. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss This One—Join This Best Crypto Presale Before It’s Gone Crypto doesn’t wait for hesitation. It rewards those who see the next breakout before it breaks. Solana gave people life-changing returns, but the window closed fast. Now, Qubetics is laying down the same tracks—community-focused, technically sound, and gaining momentum every week. With the price still in presale at just $0.1902 and a massive 10% discount between each 7-day stage, you’ve still got the chance to be early, not just early-ish. This might just be your last clean shot at getting in before the narrative catches on. If you’re serious about exploring the top cryptos to invest in april 2025, this isn’t one to delay on. Because the moment Qubetics goes live with its mainnet in Q2 2025, and real-world usage starts ramping up, the returns won’t be hypothetical anymore—they’ll be headlines. So act smart. Join this best crypto presale while the window’s still wide open and the price hasn’t spiked past what you can afford.

By acquiring Hidden Road, Ripple gains direct access to a significant client base and prime brokerage infrastructure that it could leverage for RLUSD distribution. This move follows Ripple’s December 2024 launch of its RLUSD stablecoin, aimed at institutional use. The stablecoin is designed to integrate XRP for added liquidity, an important factor as Ripple works to build stronger foundations for its crypto offerings in traditional finance (TradFi) markets. Strategic Value for Ripple and Hidden Road The document shared by SMQKE shows that the acquisition unlocks substantial opportunities for both firms. The deal provides the needed capital for Hidden Road to expand in the lending sector. For Ripple, it creates an immediate network for stablecoin distribution and opens new avenues in the TradFi space. Ripple’s move is critical because, while it launched RLUSD, USDT, and USDC remain deeply entrenched as the dominant stablecoins. The acquisition of Hidden Road allows Ripple to position RLUSD and the XRPL as serious competitors, offering an established distribution network at a time when the TradFi crypto market is still developing.

The transaction is expected to have effects beyond Ripple itself. The document shared by SMQKE noted that “more and more firms who were on the sidelines are now engaged,” predicting increased market activity over the coming quarters. Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road is not just a financial maneuver; it is a calculated step to expand RLUSD distribution, strengthen XRP’s institutional adoption, and directly challenge the dominance of existing stablecoin leaders. The strategic rationale is clear. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has revealed plans to make RLUSD one of the top five stablecoins in the market by the end of 2025. By controlling a prime broker and stablecoin simultaneously, the company gains a competitive edge in the growing tokenized TradFi economy.

Ripple CEO on Futures Launch Impact,https://timestabloid.com/new-era-for-xrp-ripple-ceo-on-futures-launch-impact/,"Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has expressed enthusiasm about the upcoming launch of XRP futures on CME Group’s trading platform, calling it a significant and long-awaited step for the cryptocurrency’s future. In a recent statement, Garlinghouse highlighted that while the token has existed since 2012 and has seen increased trading volumes, the delay in launching futures products on leading derivative platforms like CME Group has been noticeable. The Ripple CEO views the introduction of XRP futures as a vital move that could bring more professional investors into the market. He believes XRP futures contracts will provide a regulated way for investors to access XRP, paving the way for future developments, including a possible XRP spot ETF. While overdue in a bunch of ways, this is an incredibly important and exciting step in the continued growth of the XRP market! https://t.co/mnwJXKH5hi — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) April 24, 2025 CME Group officially confirmed that it will introduce XRP futures on its platform on May 19, pending approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This new offering enables investors to bet on XRP’s price fluctuations without owning the cryptocurrency or requiring a blockchain wallet. The XRP futures product will come in two contract sizes. The standard XRP futures contract will offer exposure to 50,000 tokens, targeting institutional investors. Meanwhile, the Micro XRP futures contract, with a smaller contract size of 2,500 XRP, is designed for retail investors. Both products will be cash-settled, meaning investors will receive a cash payment rather than physical XRP once the contract expires. CME Joins Other U.S. Platforms in Offering XRP Futures The announcement of CME Group’s XRP futures launch follows similar moves by other U.S.-based derivatives exchanges. Bitnomial began offering XRP futures on March 20, and Coinbase launched its own XRP futures product on April 21. CME’s move is especially significant given its status as the world’s largest derivatives exchange. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 For context, CME Group is already home to futures products tied to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. In the first quarter of 2025, CME saw an average of 198,000 contracts traded across these products. The introduction of XRP futures on CME Group’s platform is expected to boost the asset’s credibility, potentially expanding its institutional investor base. XRP Futures May Pave the Way for an XRP ETF The launch of XRP futures by CME Group could play a crucial role in the approval of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) typically considers the availability of a futures product as a key factor in approving a crypto asset for a spot ETF. A similar path was taken for Bitcoin and Ethereum, where the SEC approved spot ETFs following the introduction of their futures products. Garlinghouse’s statement reflects optimism about the positive impact of XRP futures on the asset’s growth trajectory. With increasing institutional exposure to the asset, the long-awaited futures product could mark a key milestone in the token’s evolution as a mainstream asset.

But the past week has not just been wild for BTC, the market bouncing back impressively across the segments, a bullish outlook that has investors taking aggressive steps towards positioning for a bull cycle continuation. While tariff-related uncertainty lingers, Sui and Bitcoin Pepe rank among the best crypto to buy today. Bitcoin: Analysts say demand is back Bitcoin is flexing its muscles again, breaking higher after dipping to lows of $74k earlier in April. There’s overall bullish sentiment that BTC is back to winning ways and could explode in coming months. Recently, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest predicted the crypto king could swell to $2.4 million in the next five years. Other than this long term outlook, CryptoQuant analysts have shared details that suggest Bitcoin’s short term performance is also likely on the up. They pointed to a return to demand for the benchmark asset, which many predictions put as $150k-$250k by the end of the year.

Catalysts could include exchange-traded funds (as inflows recover), regulatory clarity and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin was poised around $94,200 on April 26, 2025. Sui – an emerging force in the altcoin market? Ethereum and Solana dominate the developer market. However, a new force in the space amid growth in decentralized finance, crypto infra and gaming is Sui. Increasingly a go-to blockchain for developers across DeFi and web3 gaming, the native SUI token stands out as one of best performing tokens. Profit taking saw it retreat from its ATH of $5.35 reached in January 2025. The 34% dip now offers another buy opportunity, with price currently at $3.50 and 7% down in the past 24 hours. Analysts are predicting that a rallying Bitcoin, Ethereum or Solana could help SUI price. Bitcoin Pepe: The memecoin with BTC and SOL momentum? New opportunities abound in the crypto market, and savvy investors know where to look. However, one of the sectors where one can unearth gems is the presale market. Due diligence and understanding of risk-reward are key. Notably, a coin in presale and attracting significant attention is Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP). Bitcoin Pepe @BitcoinPepe_ · Follow The OG chain can never die. 2:30 pm · 17 Apr 2025 53 Reply Copy link Read 10 replies Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and even Official Trump (TRUMP) are all seeing notable demand. But unlike Bitcoin Pepe, these are typical memecoins that rely on viral trends or events. BPEP differs slightly. Not only is it the first BTC meme ICO, it’s building Solana on Bitcoin. It looks to dominate the resilient meme market by tapping into the security and robust network of Bitcoin and low cost and high speed of Solana. The PEP-20 standard will let anyone launch meme coins on a layer-2 solution, with other roadmap milestones key to growth. Currently, Bitcoin Pepe is priced at just $0.031, offering an early bird opportunity as presale crosses the $7 million mark. Apart from having offered a potential 311% gain to stage 1 presale buyers, the token sale will likely explode post-presale to mirror other top memecoin gainers. A 20x, 50x or even 100x is possible. The $0.031 price could be a great entry point especially as BTC is expected to rally in 2025. Interested in learning more? Visit the official Bitcoin Pepe website .

Despite a bullish trading week, which saw the altcoin trade at $2.29, the market expert explains that XRP is yet to confirm a market bottom, indicating the potential of a future price fall. Related Reading: SUI Primed For Market Correction – Analyst Sets Target At $2.75 Crucial Times Ahead: XRP Must Break $2.33–$2.45 To Invalidate Bearish Forecast In an X post on April 26, Egrag Crypto shared a bearish forecast on the XRP market, suggesting a potential downswing lies on the horizon. Based on the technical analysis of the XRP trading chart, altcoin appears to be trading below the Bull Market Support Band despite recent gains due to the extensive price correction in Q1 2025. For context, the Bull Market Support Band is a price zone formed from two moving averages to help traders detect whether an asset remains in a bull market or not. When prices fall below this support band, it often signals a bear market risk. For XRP to invalidate this negative forecast, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency must close above $2.33, which represents the immediate resistance level. Importantly, XRP must reclaim the $2.45, which currently acts as the upper edge of the Bull Market Support Band. Achieving a decisive close above both critical price levels would signal a strong market demand and reduce fear of a larger price correction. However, if XRP fails to break above this band soon, the 0.702 Fibonacci level around $1.25 becomes a likely potential target. Egrag Crypto explains that this Fibonacci level aligns with the previous breakout structure, thus making it a strong historical support. However, a price fall to $1.25 would only constitute a major retest, which could reinforce the long-term bullish structure of the XRP market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Reaches Last H1 Support, Next Major Resistance Comes Into View XRP Price Overview At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.18, reflecting a decline of 0.78% in the last day. The prominent altcoin is also down 5.08% on the monthly chart, indicating that bearish pressures are still strong in the market. According to data from Coincodex, market sentiment currently remains neutral, with investors still uncertain of XRP’s future. Notably, only 40% of XRP’s last 30 trading days have been profitable. Interestingly, Coincodex analysts expect the asset to retain its recent bullish form in the short term to potentially trade at $2.50 in five days. However, they remain highly bearish on long-term prospects, projecting a price of $1.97 in one month and $1.65 in three months.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Swissblock says that Bitcoin is now “playing in its own league” after BTC held its ground amid a severe stock market sell-off this month. According to Swissblock, Bitcoin looks to be playing the part of a safe-haven asset in the midst of market uncertainty stemming from President Trump’s trade war. “Bitcoin’s decoupling from equities is confirmed: Even if sentiment around the trade war shifts, Bitcoin won’t be heavily affected. In fact – like gold – it could strengthen. Upside pressure is brewing.” Source: Swissblock/X Bitcoin is up over 15% this month while the S&P 500 is down about 1.42%. Swissblock also says that the Bitcoin Risk Index is flashing bullish for BTC. The metric aims to evaluate Bitcoin’s current risk environment by aggregating various data points, including on-chain valuation and cost-basis metrics. According to the analytics firm, the metric suggests that Bitcoin’s selling pressure is fading while upside potential is heating up. “Beware bears! Risk-Off Signal at 0 for days: clear evidence that downside pressure is vanishing. We’re in bullish stabilization – pullbacks are now launchpads for more upside.” Source: Swissblock/X Last week, Swissblock said that BTC needs to break its immediate resistance at around $95,000 to trigger new rallies. But the firm also said that BTC may first witness a retracement toward the $89,000 zone to gather bullish momentum before sparking a fresh leg up. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $94,826.

The platform is still investigating how the attack happened, trying to identify the hackers involved and how they can retrieve the stolen funds. They are currently coordinating with law enforcement and security personnel to resolve the situation quickly. In an X post, the platform briefed its users on what it believes to be the main cause of the attack. Loopscale remarked, “The root cause of the exploit has been identified as an isolated issue with Loopscale’s pricing of RateX-based collateral. There is no issue with RateX itself related to this. Loss of funds explicitly affects depositors to SOL and USDC Genesis vaults.” Loopscale allows some functions while restricting others Attackers manipulated the RateX PT token pricing functions, draining 1200 SOL and $5.7 million USDC from the platform’s vaults. Soon after the attack, Loopscale closed off its markets temporarily. However, after a few hours, the protocol reactivated loan repayments, top-ups, and loop closing, while other application functions, like vault withdrawals, remained restricted. The attack mostly affects Loopscale USDC and SOL vault depositors, not necessarily borrowers or loopers on the platform. However, Loopscale has promised to reveal how many users were specifically affected, how holders will withdraw from their vaults, and a technical post-mortem. Before the attack, OShield, which audited the protocol in January and February of this year, identified several vulnerabilities. The project later posted on its FAQ that all high-risk issues had been resolved. Currently, there is still an ongoing audit by Sec3 on the protocol. Loopscale, only launched two years ago, on April 10, introduced a unique order book-based lending model to structure modular loans, providing more predictable terms and minimizing rate volatility. The protocol features fixed-rate, fixed-duration, and multi-asset borrowing, earning the support of major crypto companies like CoinFund, Jump Capital, and Solana Ventures. In 2021, the project, then called Bridgesplit, a proposed NFT yield product, secured about $4.25 million in VC funding from Solana Labs, Coinbase Ventures, and others. The crypto industry has lost billions of dollars to exploits since the start of 2025 A price manipulation on Oracle earlier this month led to the loss of $7 million for KiloEX. The platform is still planning to compensate affected users based on their resume time. The perpetual futures DEX, however, said that only trades that stayed open throughout the platform’s 10-day pause would be eligible for compensation. Moreover, per a Thursday blog post, participants were advised to close positions once KiloEX resumes to receive full value. Aside from the KiloEX attack, Bybit was hacked for $1.46 billion in February. The attack beats all previous record hacks, including Coincheck’s 2018 hack, when they lost $534 million, and Mt. Gox’s 2014 hack, with $470 million drained. North Korea’s Lazarus group is suspected of hacking Bybit after the exchange announced they traced the attack to malicious JavaScript code served from a compromised Safe AWS S3 bucket and claimed the breach originated outside its platform. As of Q1 2025, over $1.6 billion was lost in DeFi attacks. Platforms like zkLend, Ionic Money, Cardex, Four.Meme, Cashverse, BankX, and GoldReserve NFT have seen their funds drained. In February alone, the crypto industry had lost over $1.53 billion in 9 attacks, a 20% surge from January and an 18x increase from February 2024.

Atkins said digital assets have the potential to bring ”tremendous benefits,” including risk mitigation and cost savings. The regulator's change of course The SEC chief's remarks came as part of the third of five roundtables held in recent weeks at the Commission's Washington, D.C. headquarters. The current discussion, titled ”Know Your Custodian: Key Aspects of Holding Cryptoassets,” is part of the work of a special cryptocurrency working group. Atkins officially took office as SEC chairman earlier this week after being nominated by President Trump and subsequently confirmed by the Senate. Prior to his appointment, he founded consulting firm Patomak Global Partners in 2009, whose clients include banks, cryptocurrency exchanges and DeFi platforms. Atkins previously served as SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008, where he was appointed by President George W. Bush Jr. Criticism of the previous approach The new SEC chairman did not fail to criticize the commission's previous approach to regulating cryptocurrencies under the Biden administration. ”Unfortunately, innovation has been stifled over the past several years due to market and regulatory uncertainty, which the SEC has unfortunately encouraged,” Atkins said. Former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler took a far less friendly approach to the crypto industry, arguing that most cryptocurrencies are securities and bringing charges against major crypto platforms for failing to register with the commission. Since Gensler's departure in January, the SEC has rescinded controversial guidance on cryptocurrency accounting, halted enforcement actions against major crypto industry players, and created a cryptocurrency working group to lead ongoing roundtables. Atkins has previously said that developing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets will be a top priority of his work at the SEC. The regulator's actions in the field of cryptocurrencies already differ significantly from the approach practiced in previous years. The Cryptocurrency Working Group has already held two roundtables, the last of which was devoted to crypto trading. The SEC's change of position has been a turning point for the US cryptocurrency market. The new approach, focused on cooperation and creation of clear rules, can attract more institutional investors and stimulate the development of innovations in this area.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-27 07:18:23

Bet-David, a prominent businessman and financial commentator, shared his insights during an appearance on his popular TV program, Valuetainment, in March. Advantage over SWIFT Bet-David highlighted the advantages XRP holds over the SWIFT network, particularly in terms of speed and cost-effectiveness. While SWIFT processes an estimated $5 trillion in transactions daily, XRP’s native blockchain, the XRP Ledger, can settle transactions in just three to five seconds for a fraction of a cent. This efficiency, Bet-David suggested, positions XRP as a superior alternative to SWIFT, which currently handles a significant portion of global cross-border payments. Bet-David also emphasized the ongoing debate surrounding XRP’s potential to either complement or replace SWIFT altogether . Given XRP’s capabilities, he raised the possibility that the crypto asset could eventually handle a substantial share of the $1.25 quadrillion in annual transactions that SWIFT facilitates. Price Forecasts and Market Implications During his discussion, Bet-David also referenced an optimistic projection for XRP’s value, predicting that the token could reach $100 under certain market conditions. He based this on the scenario where XRP captures just 10% of SWIFT’s annual transaction volume, amounting to $125 trillion. Such a development, he speculated, could push XRP’s market capitalization toward $10 trillion. Bet-David also brought attention to even bolder predictions made by some analysts, suggesting that XRP could rise to as high as $1,000 per token if it were to fully displace SWIFT. While acknowledging that those making these predictions may hold significant amounts of XRP themselves, Bet-David remained confident that such outcomes were plausible if the token were to fulfill its full potential. Barriers to Mass Adoption Despite his optimism, Bet-David noted that XRP’s path to widespread institutional adoption has been hindered by the ongoing legal challenges involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This regulatory uncertainty, he argued, has prevented XRP from achieving its full market potential. However, he remains hopeful that a favourable outcome for Ripple in the SEC lawsuit could lead to broader regulatory acceptance and boost investor confidence, particularly within the U.S. Ripple’s Executive Advocacy for XRP’s Role in Global Finance Bet-David’s remarks mirror the sentiments expressed by Ripple executives, who have long championed XRP’s ability to replace traditional financial infrastructure like SWIFT. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, in particular, has repeatedly stressed the inefficiencies of the SWIFT system, highlighting XRP’s superior transaction speed and reliability. He has also pointed out the high error rate of SWIFT transactions (6%) compared to XRP’s low error rate of just 0.1%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s executives have continued to push for XRP as a better solution for global financial transactions. At the World Economic Forum in Davos this year, Ripple’s Senior Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, Eric van Miltenburg, described Ripple as a modern alternative to SWIFT, citing its faster and more affordable nature. Ripple’s advocacy for XRP as a potential SWIFT replacement has been a key part of the company’s strategy for several years, with earlier statements from Garlinghouse and Ripple Chairman Chris Larsen suggesting that XRP could eventually dominate the global payments space. Patrick Bet-David’s comments have reignited the conversation about XRP’s potential to revolutionize the global financial system. While challenges remain, particularly with regulatory hurdles, the entrepreneur’s predictions about XRP’s price and its ability to rival SWIFT show the growing interest in the crypto asset’s long-term viability. If XRP can achieve the kind of market dominance that Bet-David envisions, the price of the token could see substantial growth, benefiting from the asset’s ability to handle high volumes of transactions faster and more cheaply than traditional systems.

However, while XRP’s momentum builds, a quiet challenger, Mutuum Finance is emerging in the form that could outpace it to the $3.50 milestone. Today’s Phase 4 presale of Mutuum Finance has seen high demand, with over 9,100 investors participating and pushing the total funds raised to $7.2 million. Investors who invest at this point can be assured of a 140% return as MUTM tokens list at $0.06 on launch. With institutional interest growing and a rapidly expanding use case in decentralized finance, this low-cap competitor might surprise investors by achieving explosive growth in a fraction of the time it takes XRP to reach its target. The race is on, and while XRP is a strong performer, this under-the-radar token is quickly becoming the one to watch. XRP’s Bull Flag Could be the Prelude to $3.50, but a $0.025 Coin May Beat it to It Ripple (XRP) has long been investors’ sweetheart as they try to find stability and growth in the crypto market, and its recent bull flag formation is suggesting that it may be gearing up for a dash to $3.50. As the legal case against the SEC comes to a close, XRP’s prospects of reclaiming its former glory improve, driven by its strong use case in cross-border payments and institutional backing. However, even as XRP is regaining traction, a cheap alternative at $0.025 is beginning to create waves, drawing the attention of whales and traders. As much as Ripple’s optimism is inspiring, this new altcoin might be in for an even faster upward trend, with some projections showing that it is able to hit $3.50 first. Mutuum Finance Presale Garners Strong Investor Support Mutuum Finance ‘s Phase 4 presale continues to be in great demand by investors, with over $7.2 million and over 9,100 holders. With its current price at $0.025, the MUTM tokens present a highly rewarding opportunity for early investors who could enjoy a 140% return when the token price hits $0.06 on day one. Specialists put MUTM’s worth at around $3 in market capitalization, and hence, that much more appealing. With Phase 5 introducing the price hike to $0.03, the prospects look good for investors who are entering early in the presale. Mutuum Finance’s live leaderboard also rewards regular participants with bonus tokens for their long-term holding, reinforcing the holding mentality further. Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Smart contracts govern lending pools and adjust interest rates based on the market, offering stability to lenders and ensuring loans to borrowers. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): The decentralized method dispenses with middlemen and allows for direct connections between borrowers and lenders, offering both parties total autonomy. The platform is focused on security and transparency using open-source smart contracts and third-party audits. The MUTM token also provides long-term value through price appreciation and passive earnings, backed by a buyback mechanism. Support for multi-chains, including EVM and non-EVM blockchains, will also further increase liquidity and accessibility. $100,000 Giveaway and Community Incentives to Foster Growth Mutuum Finance is also creating its community through a $100,000 giveaway. Ten users will win $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The platform’s referral system also incentivizes users to bring new joiners to the ecosystem, creating organic growth. Early adopters are also rewarded with exclusive rewards such as special staking, governance voting, and early updates, keeping them committed to the project development. XRP aims for $3.50, but MUTM at $0.025 may beat it there. With $7.2M raised and 140% ROI expected at launch, it’s gaining fast. Strong DeFi utility, cross-chain support, and a $100K giveaway make it a top pick.

However, when asked why more celebrities aren’t Bitcoiners, he says most people simply refuse to ever sit down and study again. “It is really hard to get people to study after they graduate, from any level,” Miller told Natalie Brunell on the April 23 episode of Coin Stories. Miller claimed it takes “about 50 hours of study” to understand Bitcoin ( BTC ). Hollywood rewards those who “do not think differently” “So to say to somebody it is going to take 50 hours for you to understand this, they are like, ah, I don’t want to,” he said. “They can’t even watch a Netflix series; they can’t even watch White Lotus because it takes seven hours,” he said. Comedian and actor TJ Miller spoke to Bitcoiner Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast. Source: Natalie Brunell Miller said it takes “such a paradigm shift” to embrace Bitcoin, not just in money or the internet, but in life — and that’s also why you don’t see more Hollywood celebrities becoming Bitcoin maxis: “Hollywood rewards people that do not think differently.” During a Bitcoin lunch hosted by crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano, Miller introduced himself that, to his knowledge, he is “the only celebrity that is a Bitcoiner.” “I can’t really think of anyone else,” Miller said. While there aren't many celebrities known to be publicly active in the Bitcoin community, many have launched their own memecoins in recent years, including Iggy Azalea , Caitlyn Jenner, and Hailey Welch aka “Hawk Tuah.” However, Miller said he has been trying to educate people on Bitcoin for quite some time. He said when Bitcoin was trading between $8,000 and $12,000, he was telling friends to “just put $1,000 into Bitcoin.” Miller is confident that, at some point in the future, there will be a Hollywood movie about the Bitcoin revolution.

Cointelegraph’s Gareth Jenkinson recently sat down with TJ Miller, where it became evident that his enthusiasm for Bitcoin isn’t just surface-level . He wants to use his platform to educate and inspire others to take it seriously. “You can tell that I’m passionate about it. And so that’s what I’d like to do is sort of be able… to be somebody that helps bring cultural awareness, spread awareness and just a trusting name and face in the Bitcoin community that hopefully will bring more people to it,” Miller said.

It augments output and enhances computational capabilities but also disseminates misinformation and manipulates public discourse, as the rise of deepfakes has convincingly demonstrated. AI systems face systemic challenges, with some models exhibiting comparatively high error rates, reflecting poorly on the whole industry, and undermining public trust. The consequences of AI's limitations can be dire in self-driving vehicles, healthcare, and high-stakes industries in general. Minor visual alterations can cause autonomous vehicles to make disastrous mistakes, and small data errors can lead to misdiagnoses or overlooked risks. Verifiable AI is becoming a palpable trend as public awareness of the downsides of black-box AI grows. Beyond a buzzword, it refers to the development of accountable, auditable, and transparent AI systems. It ensures AI models and their decisions can be clarified and verified so direct users and stakeholders can trust them. It also allows organizations to trace AI systems' decision-making processes, validate the algorithms and data used, and confirm that they are operating without error or bias. In contrast, the concept of black-box AI denotes systems whose internal decision-making processes are not easily accessible or understood. The systems' output, which they arrive at through complicated computations, is untraceable because there is no insight into the underlying processes. Users receive a decision or output without a clear understanding of how the AI reached that conclusion. Joining forces in the name of trust Blockchain technology has emerged as a powerful ally to AI platforms attempting to achieve transparent decision-making. Kite AI and EigenLayer recently announced a partnership aimed at reinforcing trust and security within the framework of decentralized AI, which involves integrating EigenLayer's restaking technology into Kite AI's blockchain-based AI asset marketplace. The collaboration prioritizes scalable security and trustless verification of AI computations, resulting in an environment where AI data, models, and agents can achieve guaranteed performance and integrity backed by Ethereum's proven security mechanisms. Kite AI is an EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain, running a marketplace where people can buy, sell, or use AI tools and models. EigenLayer (""own layer"") supplements it by allowing anyone to build on top of a decentralized trust network. Its restaking system helps strengthen security by using Ethereum's trusted setup in a new way. Together, they're making sure that AI models' results can be verified and trusted without needing a middleman and that the system is scalable, meaning it can grow and handle more activity. Kite AI validates AI assets and output in a decentralized manner using EigenLayer's Autonomous Verifiable Service (AVS) framework. Specifically, EigenLayer's validators perform specialized verification tasks to confirm the accuracy of AI model outputs and that listed AI assets fulfill concrete criteria. This means Kite AI's users and developers receive additional assurance, as each AI asset or result is independently verified by a distributed staked validator network instead of relying on the asset provider's claims. Accountability in the age of hallucinating machines This partnership blurs the lines between AI and blockchain, helping mitigate the significant risks associated with AI. Humans once considered the idea of open-source tools generating convincing text, images, audio, and videos at the speed of light a panacea. However, AI's prevalence has sprung considerable concerns about validity and authenticity, and the implications of black-box tools' propensity to ""hallucinate"" can be severe, particularly for organizations trying to stand out in cutthroat markets. In the simplest of terms, ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Perplexity, and others can make things up. The tools can generate content that is not rooted in facts but in speculation. They ignore context and factual accuracy in their effort to satisfy the user's request or prompt as quickly and as closely as possible. The issue of who takes responsibility for the outcome is even more disconcerting. Current legal frameworks don't typically hold the creators of modern LLMs criminally responsible for actions taken by the direct users of the tools. There's nothing stopping them from blaming the users or the tools themselves for their faulty outputs. Despite AI's prevalence, the tools are considered experimental, i.e., they're still ""learning."" At the end of the day, the person who uses them takes responsibility for any consequences of acting on their output. They are held accountable for failing to understand their limitations. Reducing the risk of AI-generated harm AI systems rely on data for training and operation, so data providers should be held accountable for the data's accuracy and quality. They should ensure it respects privacy regulations and is ethically sourced. Decentralized data sources and verification tools lower the risk of false or biased data because they enable insight into decision-making and output. They can help address the absence of proper safeguards and thoughtful implementation and play a crucial role in combating false information, which is easily perpetuated, given how convincingly it's presented. There's otherwise no way to mitigate risks arising from the fact that AI models are trained on aggregated data, act on prompts, and lack the intuition to determine whether the data or prompts (or both) are biased, harmful, or ignorant of the evidence. Integrations of blockchain and AI emerge as the last and sometimes only line of defense. Consider a real-world example: an AI system makes a decision that negatively impacts a business, and the business suffers from relying on it without question. Whether the AI vendor or developer will take responsibility for an error resulting from a system flaw is questionable. The responsibility will likely be borne by the employee who used the tool without understanding how it works and potentially by their manager for failing to supervise them. It might all end with the employee being fired, but a huge error will affect the entire organization. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

She pointed out that the contracts will be “financially settled in USD,” meaning there will be no actual handling, movement, or delivery of XRP upon expiration. Instead, all settlements will occur in U.S. dollars. ""Financially settled contracts in USD"" means XRP is not handled, moved or delivered upon expiration. https://t.co/lvyIsTb4rL pic.twitter.com/g92rcFP1OE — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) April 24, 2025 In response to a comment criticizing her outlook as negative, Crypto Eri explained her position, stating, “Using the asset matters.” She emphasized that real utility and direct interaction with XRP are critical for influencing its market fundamentals. The Importance Of Using XRP Another community member noted that financially settled contracts still track the price of XRP and can influence sentiment, hedging strategies, and even spot market flows. He argued that while no XRP changes hands, exposure to price movements alone can matter. Crypto Eri countered this stance, arguing that the price tracking relies on a centralized oracle service. She said the underlying asset “could be kangaroo meat,” illustrating her view that such arrangements reduce the contract’s meaningful connection to XRP itself. She maintained that to genuinely impact XRP’s market value, transactions must involve the asset. Crypto Eri further elaborated that these types of financial products resemble prediction markets. Many experts believe nothing else matches XRP’s utility . However, for the asset to experience substantial growth, there must be a direct influence on its supply and demand through purchases and settlements involving it. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reception and Broader Implications Not everyone agreed with Crypto Eri’s critical view. Some commenters suggested that her posts might discourage optimism about XRP’s future. One user mentioned that such comments contribute to perceptions that she has become a “buzz kill” within the community. Crypto Eri reiterated that positive price action must be driven by genuine utility rather than speculative financial instruments. She explained that while price forecasts and speculative trading have long been features of the digital asset space, they do not create the kind of sustained demand necessary to alter the price in the long term. In her view, the real driver of value in cryptocurrencies should be tangible use cases that increase the need for the asset itself, not simply bets on future price movements. A well-known crypto CEO recently highlighted institutional adoption as a crucial factor that could aid XRP’s growth, and utility is important for institutions looking at it. While CME Group’s decision to introduce XRP futures has been welcomed by many as a sign of growing institutional interest, not using the digital asset could lower its positive impact on the asset’s price.

The biggest success stories often begin with small, calculated moves—and right now, a smart $500 to $750 investment could set the foundation for a major narrative in the next cycle. As Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP continue pushing upward, a new contender is capturing serious attention: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quietly Gaining Ground as a 2025 Power Play The window to catch projects before mass awareness is always limited—and MAGACOINFINANCE is currently sitting in that rare sweet spot. It’s a structured project with organic wallet growth, real community engagement, and expanding traction without relying on gimmicks or artificial marketing.

NEAR Protocol (NEAR) is pushing usability forward with user-friendly blockchain experiences. These projects all offer strong infrastructure—but the key difference? MAGACOINFINANCE still carries the rare advantage of being undiscovered by the masses—where early movers can truly dominate the next cycle. Final Word Could a small, smart investment today turn into $850,000 by 2025? History shows that early conviction— before the headlines —is how crypto fortunes are made.

Speaking at a town hall in Georgia on April 25, Ossoff criticized the president for what he described as “selling access” to his office. “I saw just 48 hours ago, he is granting audiences to people who buy his meme coin,” Ossoff said, according to NBC News . “When the sitting president of the United States is effectively accepting payments for access, that clearly qualifies as an impeachable offense.” Senator Backs Trump Impeachment but Says Action Unlikely Without Democrat Majority While Ossoff emphasized his firm backing for impeachment proceedings, he acknowledged that any such action would face significant hurdles unless Democrats regain control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Currently, Republicans hold the majority in both chambers. The controversy stems from an April 23 announcement on the Official Trump memecoin website, which revealed plans for an exclusive dinner hosted by President Trump at his Washington, D.C. golf club. The event is reserved for the top 220 TRUMP token holders, with the website posting a public leaderboard and registration details. Following the announcement, the TRUMP token surged over 50%, according to CoinMarketCap. WATCH: Woman yells about Trump: ""We need him impeached! We need him removed!"" Sen.

Additionally, no guests are permitted. $TRUMP Token Team Denies $300K Requirement for Dinner with President In a statement posted on April 24, the $TRUMP token team clarified that holders do not need to spend $300,000 to qualify for its “Dinner with President Trump” contest. The team said that entry includes exchange and locked holdings not participating in the contest. Eligibility is determined solely by registered users on the official leaderboard, which ranks time-weighted $TRUMP balances throughout the competition. “People have been incorrectly quoting #220 on the block explorer as the cutoff. That’s wrong because it includes things like locked tokens, exchanges, market makers, and those who are not participating,” the team said. The project emphasized that all participants must register to be counted. As of the announcement, the 220th-ranked participant held just over $400 worth of tokens. The leaderboard is available at trumpdinner.gettrumpmemes.com. Tokens from the cliff unlock and daily distributions will remain locked for an additional 90 days, the team said, extending past the competition period.

By turning physical assets into digital tokens, blockchain enables secure, fractional ownership and trading, which can cut operational inefficiencies, lower administrative costs, and boost retail investor participation. Over the past eight years, tokenization has opened up new paths for real estate investment, and this momentum is growing fast. Deloitte projects that by 2035, $4 trillion of real estate could be tokenized , soaring from less than $0.3 trillion in 2024 with an impressive 27% compound annual growth rate. The tokenized real estate market will likely be driven by three key segments: Tokenized loans and securitizations are expected to dominate, reaching $2.39 trillion by 2035. Private real estate funds could grow to $1 trillion, capturing 8.5% market share. Ownership of undeveloped land and projects may reach $50 billion. Blockchain platforms could streamline real estate funds by simplifying issuance, servicing, and secondary market trading, all while reducing reliance on intermediaries. Two models are emerging: ""off-chain"" funds using debt tokens backed by loan pools, and fully ""on-chain"" real estate trust deeds. A real-world example is Kin Capital's planned $100 million real estate debt fund on Chintai's blockchain. Tokenization allows investors to build hyper-personalized portfolios, targeting assets based on sustainability, location, or other custom preferences. However, managing defaults will be critical—early players must develop mechanisms where lenders can access real-world assets tied to tokens if needed. Beyond property, securitized loans are gaining traction. Despite skepticism after the 2008 crisis, blockchain-backed securities offer faster reporting, better transparency, and lower costs. For instance, LiquidFi slashed mortgage-backed securities reporting from 55 days to just 30 minutes using Stellar blockchain. Tokenization also unlocks dynamic financing for projects like residential developments and data centers. Major deals, like T-RIZE Group's $300 million tokenization of a Canadian housing project, show its potential. As more blockchains emerge, interoperability will be crucial. Future systems must allow tokens to move seamlessly between platforms while preserving privacy and meeting regulations. Advances like layer-2 solutions and new regulatory frameworks are paving the way for broader adoption. For real estate managers and investors looking to engage, several factors are key: choosing the right blockchain, ensuring secure custody solutions, understanding tax implications, and reinforcing cybersecurity defenses.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-04-27 08:57:11

This week, Brazilian bank Itaú made the headlines by announcing its new $210 million investment in Bitcoin. On the other hand, Argentina’s CNV presented its new tokenisation regime. Itaú to invest $210 million in Bitcoin Itaú Bank announced an initial investment of 210 million dollars to establish Oranje, a company focused on accumulating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. This new initiative follows the model of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), a company founded by Michael Saylor, the world’s largest Bitcoin holder. Guilherme Gomes, the previous CEO of Swan Bitcoin, will lead the business, with Guilherme Ferreira from Bahema serving as CFO. According to Beincrypto, the governing structure includes prominent crypto figures such as Eric Weiss and Fernando Ulrich. Oranje intends to use fundraising tactics such as debt issuance and stock sales, following the example of companies like Strategy. The firm also provides tax and operational benefits to clients wanting direct Bitcoin exposure without intermediaries. Oranje, formed by Banco Itaú, is betting on Bitcoin’s rise as a strategic reserve asset, citing its global adoption of only 3% despite being the world’s fifth-largest asset, valued at $2 trillion. The company sees recent legislative changes, notably those following Donald Trump’s election in the United States, as beneficial to the cryptocurrency industry. Oranje is following Strategy’s method, which has already been adopted by a number of companies around the world. Oranje, backed by partners including Itaú BBA, Pinheiro Neto Advogados, Pillsbury, and one of the Big Four auditing firms, believes the “Bitcoin Standard” is altering corporate treasury strategies. They see this trend as a one-of-a-kind market opportunity that has the potential to transform how firms manage their reserves. Argentina proposes a tokenisation framework Argentina’s National Securities Commission (CNV) has presented a new regulatory proposal on tokenisation to members of the capital market and virtual asset industries. According to Cointelegraph , the draft rule, which was recently authorised under RG No. 1060, establishes a framework for the digital depiction of marketable securities through the use of distributed ledger technologies. CNV President Dr. Roberto Silva noted the proposal’s unique nature, which is now open for public comment for 15 days. The policy attempts to equate tokenised assets with traditional securities while also improving security, traceability, and transparency. It enables the tokenisation of a diverse set of assets, including stocks, bonds, investment fund units, and CEDEARS. CNV authorities detailed the technical scope of the rule with the cooperation of significant business associations and legal firms, establishing Argentina as a regional leader in digital asset regulation. Panama City embraces crypto for tax payments Panama City Mayor Mayer Mizrachi and Towerbank President Benjamín Méndez struck an agreement at Panama Blockchain Week 2025 to allow citizens to pay municipal taxes with cryptocurrency. The program, undertaken by Towerbank’s fiduciary subsidiary Towertrust, ensures that all cryptocurrency payments are translated into US dollars before they reach the city’s accounts. This approach enables the municipality to benefit from innovation without directly handling digital assets, while retaining compliance and transparency. Mayor Mizrachi described the arrangement as a progressive step toward a digitally connected public administration that provides flexible, secure, and lawful payment options. The initiative will be governed by a formal Municipal Agreement, with cryptocurrency provided as an extra option alongside existing platforms like as Yappy.

MAGACOINFINANCE is doing exactly that by focusing on real execution, organic community growth, and transparent rollout phases. The project’s growth isn’t about hype—it’s about foundations. Developers are communicating regularly. Community engagement is picking up steam. And traders who specialize in spotting early-stage gems are already flagging MAGACOINFINANCE as one of 2025’s potential breakout stories. This isn’t about chasing candles. It’s about entering before the rush—and the clock is ticking. Why XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin Are Still at the Top XRP has completed its regulatory transformation and is now operating with full clarity in critical global markets. Its real-world use case for payment settlements keeps strengthening its long-term value proposition. Solana continues to dominate the conversation around speed and cost-efficiency. Its NFT resurgence, dApp ecosystem expansion, and lightning-fast settlement layer make it essential for developers who need scale without compromise. Bitcoin remains the king of digital assets. Its macro narrative has only grown stronger, with institutions building bigger positions and Bitcoin ETFs bringing in waves of new capital. But for investors seeking asymmetric early-stage upside? MAGACOINFINANCE is quickly standing out as the name to watch. Other Movers Adding to the Energy: Chainlink, Kaspa, and Polkadot Chainlink continues to be the trusted oracle infrastructure that powers smart contracts across virtually every major blockchain, expanding rapidly into new data streams and real-world integrations. Kaspa is rising fast on its unique proof-of-work architecture, offering high throughput without sacrificing decentralization—perfect for users prioritizing speed and security. Polkadot remains a leader in multi-chain solutions. Its parachain innovations are fostering an ecosystem where specialized chains can thrive independently and still connect seamlessly. Each of these projects is critical—but MAGACOINFINANCE still holds the advantage of being at the beginning of its lifecycle, where growth potential is widest. Final Word A 60,000% move might seem outrageous—but in crypto, it’s the early signals that determine whether you’re chasing or leading. MAGACOINFINANCE.COM , alongside Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP , is gaining momentum fast. The question is simple: will you act while it’s still early—or wait until it’s history?

Ossoff criticized Trump's move as a “direct interaction sell” and called it an “impeachable offense.” “When a sitting president of the United States is selling an interaction in exchange for payments made directly to him, there is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense,” Ossoff said, addressing a visibly angry crowd in a video shared by Georgia political reporter Greg Bluestein. The House of Representatives has the power to impeach a federal official, including the president, for treason, bribery, or “other high crimes and misdemeanors.” If impeached, the president would face trial in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is required for removal. Related News: Bitcoin-Friendly Senator Warns Against the FED's Trap for Cryptocurrencies Trump, who was impeached twice in his first term and acquitted by the Senate both times, has positioned himself as a defender of the crypto industry during his current presidency. But Trump’s personal involvement in cryptocurrency ventures has also raised ethical concerns. Businesses linked to Trump and his family include stablecoin issuer World Liberty Financial, bitcoin mining ventures, crypto-based ETFs and memecoins named after both the president and the first lady. The latest controversy centers around the TRUMP memecoin, which announced Wednesday that its top 220 investors will be invited to a gala dinner with the president at his Virginia golf club on May 22. Those in the top 25 will also receive VIP treatment, including a reception with Trump and a tour of the White House. Since the announcement, the value of the TRUMP token has increased by more than 40%. Trump and his close associates are estimated to own 80% of the token supply, which is currently worth around $10.8 billion. *This is not investment advice.

In a new video update on Fundstrat’s YouTube channel, Lee starts off by noting that on April 24th, a Zweig breadth thrust was triggered on the S&P 500 index. The Zweig breadth thrust is an indicator that attempts to detect the early stages of a potential bull run by dividing the 10-day moving average of the number of advancing stocks by the total number of stocks. Lee says that the Zweig breadth thrust has nearly always signaled imminent stock market rallies. “That has happened 11 times since 1978 and notably, one month, six months and 12 months later, stock markets are always up. And this was triggered on April 24.” Secondly, Lee notes that the high yield options adjusted spreads (OaS) retraced 50% of its widening on April 23rd. A shrinking of credit spreads – the difference in yield between riskier junk bonds and “risk-free” government bonds – typically signals stability and healthy investor risk appetite. “That’s a positive development because we are now walking back from a recession risk. If high yield spreads had gone from 500 [basis points] to 1,000, a recession was guaranteed, but instead it’s reversed almost all the widening back to even levels before April 2nd.” Lee also says that the S&P 500 saw two straight days where 90% of the S&P 500 stocks rallied, an event that has historically led to further upside. “That means that stocks, within a couple of days apart, had posted two days where the advancing gains were 90% or more. As you can see here, three times since 1979, stocks are higher three, six and 12 months later.” Source: Fundstrat Lastly, the investor takes note of the volatility index (VIX) – a measure of market volatility based on data from the Chicago Board Options Exchange – closing below the 31 level. According to Lee, the VIX is now signaling a drop off in future volatility and likely strength for equities.

Meanwhile, XRP is reawakening, backed by legal clarity, fresh institutional partnerships, and a technical setup that could drive it well beyond previous highs. Yet, the real wildcard, Mutuum Finance in this rally may be a new altcoin quietly stacking volume and whale support. The project has already attracted over 9100 investors, raising more than $7.2 million, and is offering incentives such as a $100,000 token giveaway to further boost community engagement. As ADA approaches its cap, XRP and this emerging token seem to be just getting started. The Mutuum Finance team has unveiled a new dashboard with a leaderboard that ranks the top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for staying in the top 50 positions. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off The decentralized finance (DeFi) market adopts Mutuum Finance because of its innovative crypto lending approach which has gained fast momentum. More than 9100 investors have participated in the project’s unique approach through which they poured $7.2 million of capital. Phase 4 features a $0.025 token price with a brief entry period that ends when prices rise 20% because it marks the termination of early investment possibilities. Investors participating in the presale phase can get an enormous 140% ROI by purchasing the token at $0.06. The decentralized finance sector keeps expanding while Mutuum Finance emerges as the leading pioneer which brings innovative lending strategies and solid market leadership. Mutuum Finance utilizes CertiK to conduct an audit of their platform security which will receive publication on their social media channels afterwards. CertiK will audit the platform after completion before the official report gets published on their social media platforms for public transparency and trust. Shaking Up Crypto Lending through a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is redefining crypto lending by interweaving two dominant models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model allows users to contribute stablecoins to liquidity pools managed by smart contracts, earning passive income with instant borrowing availability for platform players. Even interest rates are adjusted automatically by the smart contracts to maximize lenders’ returns and lower borrowing costs. The P2P model takes decentralization to the level of eliminating third parties, allowing borrowers and lenders to directly interact. This provides users with the option to negotiate individualized loan agreements, facilitating higher transparency and an intuitive borrowing experience. Through the Ethereum blockchain the platform stablecoin reaches price stability by using reserve-backed USD. The configuration works as a risk management system for algorithmic stablecoins to secure safe and reliable financial transactions. Mutuum Finance constructs the foundation of future decentralized finance by uniting emerging lending schemes with a solid infrastructure. The MUTM Giveaway As part of its community-building initiative, Mutuum Finance is running an engaging giveaway campaign, offering away $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Ten lucky users will receive $10,000 worth of tokens each. The new referral program for the platform also compensates users who bring in new investors. Users also receive access to exclusive staking pools, governance rights, and platform updates, encouraging long-term devotion and loyalty to the platform. While Cardano (ADA) might cap its bull cycle around $5 and XRP gains renewed traction, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly positioning itself as the breakout altcoin of 2025. With over $7.2 million raised, more than 9,100 investors onboard, and a presale price still holding at just $0.025, the window for early, high-upside entry is closing fast. As legacy tokens approach their ceilings, this new DeFi disruptor may offer the best room to run. Secure your position in Mutuum Finance now, before the rest of the market catches on.

Without flashy marketing or meme-fueled communities, Lightchain AI is letting its technology speak for itself. The project’s powerful presale momentum , which has already crossed $19.5 million, signals a growing base of serious investors focused on long-term potential. What makes Lightchain AI stand out is its real-world utility, efficient scalability, and its ability to support AI-optimized workflows within decentralized ecosystems. As larger tokens stagnate or struggle for attention, Lightchain AI continues to gain traction organically. Its quiet rise is proving that genuine innovation and a committed roadmap can outperform hype—especially in a DeFi landscape increasingly starved for trustworthy, high-performance solutions. In this article, we'll take a closer look at Lightchain AI and its potential impact on the world of decentralized finance. Could This Under-the-Radar Crypto Be the Next Big Thing in DeFi? While most DeFi tokens rely on aggressive marketing or meme culture to gain traction, Lightchain AI is carving a different path—one grounded in functionality, not flash. Built to handle high-volume transactions while integrating decentralized AI protocols, Lightchain AI’s infrastructure supports scalable automation across financial workflows. Investors seeking substance over spectacle are beginning to notice, especially with the presale surpassing $19.5 million. Its network efficiency, near-linear scalability, and developer-friendly APIs are attracting attention from those who understand what sustainable DeFi really requires. As token speculation loses its shine, this under-the-radar project could become a core part of decentralized finance in 2025 and beyond, offering tools that streamline operations and reduce congestion while quietly gaining long-term trust in the space. What Makes This Low-Profile Token a Rising Star in Decentralized Finance? Unlike many tokens that depend on influencer hype or short-lived market surges, Lightchain AI’s rise is fueled by robust on-chain architecture. Its Proof of Intelligence mechanism authenticates AI-driven computations while maintaining a seamless workflow across its decentralized network. Developers and early adopters are drawn to the token’s speed, gas optimization capabilities, and cross-chain flexibility, especially as DeFi protocols demand more from their foundational tech. The project’s focus on actual utility has already secured it over $19.5 million in presale contributions, indicating institutional-level interest. With a rising emphasis on AI integration within DeFi systems, Lightchain AI's quiet but steady positioning could transform it from an overlooked gem to a cornerstone of the space—without needing to ride hype-driven waves. Is This Quiet Contender Set to Disrupt the DeFi Landscape in 2025? Lightchain AI is not just keeping pace with emerging trends—it’s setting new standards. As 2025 approaches, DeFi is shifting toward intelligent automation, lower transaction friction, and multi-chain interoperability. Lightchain AI is delivering on all fronts with its AI Virtual Machine (AIVM), designed to execute AI-enhanced contracts across decentralized applications. This places it far ahead of most low-cap tokens that lack real infrastructure. Its presale, already hitting $19.5 million, reflects growing confidence in its capacity to scale and innovate. While others clamor for visibility, Lightchain AI is quietly building the tools that the next generation of DeFi will run on. This low-profile yet high-impact strategy may soon position it as one of the top disruptors in the decentralized finance ecosystem.

However, bullish momentum seems to have stalled in the past day amidst a minor retracement and an ongoing price consolidation. Notably, speculations over Bitcoin’s ability to sustain the current uptrend also persist. Interestingly, popular crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci has shed some light on possible developments that could decide BTC’s price movement in the immediate future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Remains In Positive Zone — What This Means For Price Bitcoin MVRV Faces Resistance At 365 SMA In an X post on Saturday, Kesmeci reports that the Bitcoin MVRV is now facing an important resistance at its 365-day simple moving average (365SMA). The analyst explains that potential developments from this situation are influential to Bitcoin’s mid-term future. The Bitcoin MVRV ratio (Market Value to Realized Value) is an important on-chain metric that measures whether Bitcoin trading price is relatively overvalued or undervalued compared to its realized price. Technically, the MVRV is used to indicate profitability, but this metric can also signal market stages, such as a price top/bottom, or identify the current price trend. Meanwhile, the MVRV 365SMA, which produces an average of all MVRV ratios over the past 365 days, represents a critical threshold for medium-term reversal. Typically, when the MVRV remains below the 365SMA, it signals a bearish market, while a crossover above the 365SMA is interpreted as a bullish confirmation. Following recent market developments, Bitcoin’s MVRV currently stands at 2.13, just slightly below its 365SMA at 2.14. To confirm a long-term bullish market despite recent gains, an upward crossover between the MVRV and its 365SMA must occur, signaling a potential medium-term trend reversal following the prolonged correction phase in early 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Flips Key Resistance Into Support – Can Bulls Reclaim $2,000 Level? Bitcoin Network Fees Climb By 42% In other developments, on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock reports that Bitcoin network fees surged by 42% in the past week. During this time, traders spent $4.03 million on transaction fees, suggesting a high level of network engagement. Meanwhile, crypto exchanges also recorded net withdrawals valued at $356 million. While this figure falls far lower from the $1.3 billion reported in the previous week, it indicates that many investors are still opting to keep their assets. Both the increase in network activity and sustained exchange outflows point to strong underlying demand and positive sentiment in the Bitcoin market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to trade at $94,233 after a 0.78% decline in the past day. On larger timeframes, the premier cryptocurrency remains in profit with gains of 11.27% and 8.59% in the last seven and 30 days, respectively.

Today, as Bitcoin (BTC) , Cardano (ADA) , and XRP continue making headlines, a deeper shift is underway—savvy traders are quietly positioning themselves into projects that still offer real early-stage upside. One name rising fast on these watchlists is MAGACOINFINANCE.COM —an emerging contender that is earning serious respect among those who know the biggest gains come before mainstream attention. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quickly Emerging as a Prime Early-Stage Opportunity The real advantage in crypto has always belonged to those who moved before the noise. Right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is entering that crucial phase where smart positioning could deliver outsized rewards later. Unlike many hype-driven launches, MAGACOINFINANCE is growing with real traction: Organic wallet growth Active community expansion Rising interest among private trading circles It’s structured, disciplined, and scaling steadily—similar to the early moments that once defined Bitcoin and Cardano’s early expansions. Other Top Projects Worth Watching: MATIC, VET, INJ, and DOT Polygon (MATIC) continues leading scaling solutions with efficient Layer-2 technology. VeChain (VET) drives real-world blockchain adoption through supply chain innovation. Injective (INJ) is reshaping decentralized finance with its native trading ecosystem. Polkadot (DOT) maintains its reputation for pioneering interoperability between blockchains. While all strong projects, MAGACOINFINANCE offers something different—it’s still before mass visibility, where early movers capture the biggest advantage. Final Word Every market cycle reminds us: the largest gains don’t come from chasing headlines—they come from moving before them.

43860893,https://cryptonews.com/?p=355354,1745748422,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/43860893.jpeg,"Bitcoin Price Stability at $94,767: Is This the Final Opportunity Before Price Discovery Mode?",https://cryptonews.com/news/bitcoin-price-stability-at-94767-is-this-the-final-opportunity-before-price-discovery-mode/,"Bitcoin (BTC) is holding steady around $94,767 after an 11% surge from recent lows, fueled by a wave of institutional inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock’s IBIT ETF led the charge, absorbing over $240 million in a single day, followed by Fidelity with a $108 million addition. Cumulative flows into Bitcoin ETFs now exceed $41.2 billion, signaling a renewed wave of institutional confidence. BREAKING BLACKROCK JUST BOUGHT $240 MILLION WORTH OF BITCOIN pic.twitter.com/HH4URkxSDF — DustyBC Crypto (@TheDustyBC) April 26, 2025 This aggressive buying spree coincided with Bitcoin’s jump from $85,000 to near $94,250, igniting fresh forecasts of a breakout past the $100,000 mark. ETF-driven momentum combined with reduced miner selling is creating a supply squeeze, historically a catalyst for strong price action. Key Drivers Behind the Rally: BlackRock IBIT ETF inflows: $240M in one day Fidelity ETF inflows: $108M Cumulative ETF flows: $41.2B+ Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas summed it up: “It’s a Bitcoin bender out there,” highlighting the sudden and intense shift in ETF sentiment. Institutional Appetite Grows Amid Market Shifts Beyond Bitcoin, BlackRock’s expanding digital asset strategy further reflects this shift. On April 24, BlackRock confirmed $240 million in Bitcoin purchases alongside $54 million in Ethereum acquisitions. CEO Larry Fink, once a crypto skeptic, now labels Bitcoin “digital gold” and sees Ethereum as the backbone for tokenized finance. BREAKING: BLACKROCK JUST BOUGHT $240,000,000 WORTH OF BITCOIN HERE WE GOOO pic.twitter.com/dwpShxGdFf — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) April 26, 2025 Following the announcement, Ethereum surged 5.2% to $3,850, with trading volume jumping 120% in just an hour. This sharp move underscores the growing role of institutional players in driving crypto market trends. Key Institutional Moves: BlackRock Bitcoin purchase: $240M BlackRock Ethereum purchase: $54M Ethereum volume spike: +120% in 1 hour With clearer regulatory frameworks emerging, analysts expect institutional interest to intensify, boosting the maturing digital asset landscape. Bitcoin Price Outlook: Final Hurdle Before $100K? On the technical front, Bitcoin is nearing a critical resistance at $95,380, where a long-term descending trendline meets horizontal supply. The 50-day EMA ($87,270) remains intact as strong dynamic support, but the MACD indicator is starting to plateau—warning that momentum could pause if $95,380 isn’t decisively broken. Trade Plan: Buy breakout: Above $95,380 Upside targets: $99,620 and $104,820 Stop-loss: Below $88,620 For new traders, this is a textbook “make-or-break” setup. A clean daily close above $95,380 could catapult Bitcoin toward new all-time highs. However, a rejection here could trigger a healthy correction toward the $88,620 support zone. Patience will be crucial: real price discovery mode may only begin after breaching $95,380 with strong volume confirmation. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5M Milestone as 81% Yield Boosts Staking Demand Investor momentum behind BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) remains strong, with the Ethereum-based project officially surpassing the $5 million mark in its ongoing presale. As of today, $5.05 million has been raised out of a $5.74 million target, signaling rising urgency among buyers as the next price jump approaches. The current token price stands at $0.00248, offering a limited window before another repricing. High-Yield Staking with Flexible Access BTCBULL continues to set itself apart from typical meme assets by focusing on sustainable utility. The project’s staking program offers an estimated 81% annual yield, complemented by Bitcoin-backed distribution rewards. Crucially, users retain full liquidity with the ability to unstake anytime—no mandatory lockup periods or penalties. Latest Staking Snapshot: Total Tokens Staked: 1,293,025,857 BTCBULL Estimated Annual Yield: 81% APY Unstaking: Available at any time This flexible structure appeals to both yield hunters and investors seeking upside potential without giving up liquidity. Presale Snapshot: Final Stretch Before Repricing With less than $683,000 left before the next price adjustment, BTCBULL’s presale is rapidly entering its final stages at the current rate. Investors are securing positions before the project’s valuation steps higher. Presale Metrics (Updated): Token Price: $0.00248 USDT Raised: $5,058,002.58 out of $5,741,234 target BTCBULL combines an aggressive yield model with meme-token upside, carving out a niche for investors looking for more than just speculative trading. As the remaining funding gap narrows, the next price increase could arrive imminently—rewarding early movers in the process.

Institutions and governments worldwide are starting to recognize the unique monetary properties of Bitcoin ( BTC ), according to Adam Back, co-founder and CEO of Blockstream and the inventor of Hashcash. “$MSTR and other treasury companies are an arbitrage of the dislocation between the bitcoin future and todays fiat world,” Back wrote in an April 26 X post. “A sustainable and scalable $100-$200 trillion trade front-running hyperbitcoinization. scalable enough for most big listed companies to move to btc treasury,” he added. Hyperbitcoinization refers to the theoretical future where Bitcoin soars to become the largest global currency, replacing fiat money due to its inflationary economics and growing distrust in the legacy financial system. Source: Adam Back Related: Crypto sentiment recovers, but weekend liquidity risks remain Bitcoin’s price outpacing fiat money inflation remains the main driver of global hyperbitcoinization, Back said, adding: “Some people think treasury strategy is a temporary glitch. i’m saying no it's a logical and sustainable arbitrage. but not for ever, the driver is bitcoin price going up over 4 year periods faster than interest and inflation.” Back’s comments come nearly two months after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a national Bitcoin reserve from BTC forfeited in government criminal cases.

As Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, Metaplanet plans to acquire 21,000 BTC by 2026. US financial institutions may also have more confidence in adopting Bitcoin after the US Federal Reserve withdrew its 2022 guidance discouraging banks from engaging with cryptocurrency. “Banks are now free to begin supporting Bitcoin,” Saylor said in response to the guidance withdrawal. “Banks will now be supervised through normal processes, signaling a more open regulatory environment for digital asset integration,” Nexo dispatch analyst Iliya Kalchev told Cointelegraph.

Maybe it was Ethereum when it was still under $50 or Injective before it even cracked $1. That moment where you scroll through old charts thinking, “Man, this could’ve been it.” That feeling? It’s real—and in 2025, it’s happening all over again with some new players stepping into the spotlight. Ethereum and Injective are showing strong signs in recent upgrades and real-world traction, but a new project, Qubetics, might just be the one still flying under the radar—with serious potential in both tech and returns. Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another name on the watchlist. It’s solving problems most major blockchains are still struggling with—stuff like interoperability, data silos, and cross-chain user headaches. And it’s not hype-driven; it’s feature-packed. While Ethereum and Injective are making headlines, Qubetics is quietly building something game-changing and still in presale. This might be the first time in a long time where something this ambitious is also this accessible. For those looking for the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term, this presale might be the kind of opportunity most people only recognize after the ship’s already sailed. Right now, though? It’s still docked—and open. One of the top crypto presale projects this season might just be this one. Qubetics Isn’t Just Hype—It’s Solving What Others Couldn’t The reason Qubetics is catching major attention right now? It’s the world’s first Web3-aggregated blockchain that connects major chains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana into one unified structure. If that sounds like a big deal—it is. Right now, users and businesses are stuck juggling multiple wallets, clunky apps, and tons of protocols that don’t communicate. Qubetics flips that entire mess into a smooth experience with seamless asset transfers, shared data flows, and real cross-chain usability. Picture a logistics company needing real-time payment data on Ethereum while tracking smart contracts built on Solana. Normally, that’s a tech headache. With Qubetics, they can manage everything under one interface—without switching chains or dealing with conversion fees. For retail users, it simplifies how apps and wallets function. Say goodbye to managing three different extensions and hoping your assets don’t get lost in translation. For developers, Qubetics is basically a dream tool. Instead of building for just one ecosystem, they get access to a multichain toolbox that actually works together. That’s huge for scaling projects, reaching more users, and creating true cross-platform dApps. This kind of flexibility is why people are calling Qubetics one of the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term—because it’s not just another token. It’s foundational tech that lets Web3 finally talk to itself. Why Qubetics Presale Might Be One of the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term While many coins rally after listings, Qubetics is letting early participants get in before the hype with a fully structured presale. It’s currently in its 31st stage, priced at $0.1902, and every stage lasts exactly 7 days, ending on Sunday at 12 a.m. sharp. After every stage, the price climbs by 10%, which means the clock’s ticking every single week. So far, over $16.4 million has already been raised, with more than 25,200 token holders and 509 million $TICS sold—and counting. Now here’s where things get spicy for those looking for real short-term gains. If $TICS reaches $1, that’s a 425.53% ROI. A $200 investment today would turn into $1,051.06. But wait—if $TICS hits $5 post-launch, that same $200 turns into $5,055.42. At $10? It’s $10,310.85. And for those thinking long but fast: $TICS hitting $15 would mean $15,466.27 off just two hundred bucks. That’s not just projection—it’s math based on real presale pricing and stage-by-stage progression. And don’t forget: Qubetics isn’t a guessing game. With its mainnet launching in Q2 2025, this isn’t a “maybe someday” project—it’s a ticking countdown. For those in search of the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term , especially ones with real tech and community traction, this Qubetics presale ranks up there as possibly the best crypto presale of the year. Ethereum’s Updates Keep It Strong—but Competition’s Closing In Ethereum has been the king of smart contracts for years, and it’s not slowing down. Its recent push toward scaling with Layer 2 integrations like Arbitrum and Optimism is giving it the edge again. These upgrades are slashing gas fees and making apps way more usable, especially for retail community members. Ethereum also dropped proto-danksharding as part of its dev roadmap, which, when fully rolled out, will massively expand throughput. Beyond that, Ethereum’s growing real-world use cases are speaking volumes. From stablecoin settlements to NFT authentication, brands and enterprises are building directly on its infrastructure. That said, it’s not without flaws. It’s still slower than some new chains and definitely more expensive. But its brand trust, massive community, and ecosystem depth make it a reliable choice for those looking at best cryptos to buy and hold for short term—as long as they can handle the occasional gas fee spike. What’s impressive is Ethereum’s ability to maintain relevance even while newer chains try to eat its market share. It’s like the Apple of crypto—maybe not the fastest innovator anymore, but its upgrades still shake the entire industry. Whether you’re into staking, NFTs, or DeFi, Ethereum is still the hub where most real activity happens. Injective Is Gearing Up for Real-World Domination Injective might’ve started as a DeFi protocol, but it’s evolving fast into one of the most talked-about infrastructures in the Web3 space. With its recent $150M ecosystem initiative focused on real-world finance and AI integrations, Injective is making major moves. It already powers lightning-fast trading and synthetic asset creation—and now it’s expanding into AI-driven tools and tokenized RWAs (real-world assets). One of the key reasons Injective is heating up is its insane transaction speeds and gas efficiency. It’s built using the Cosmos SDK with native interoperability, meaning it can work seamlessly with other chains like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Cosmos without the typical bridge delays or security risks. That makes it especially attractive to developers trying to launch scalable apps. Injective also recently partnered with institutions exploring on-chain derivatives and synthetic trading products. This isn’t a side project anymore; it’s becoming serious infrastructure. For those scanning the charts and headlines looking for the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term, Injective might be one of the most underrated gems right now. It’s got the speed, the tech, and the partnerships to keep moving fast—without needing hype to fuel it. Conclusion: Three Chains, Three Plays—But Only One Still in Presale Ethereum is holding its place with deep integrations and continued innovation. Injective is proving that newer chains can deliver real-world performance with institutional-grade features. But Qubetics? It’s combining both—and doing it before the world fully catches on. It’s the only one of the three that’s still in presale, and it’s solving core blockchain problems while offering massive upside. For anyone seriously scanning the market for the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term, Qubetics is currently the one still priced under $0.20 but showing potential to climb to $15+ within the year. The tech is strong, the use case is crystal clear, and the presale model is built for rapid growth. Don’t be the one reading this article six months from now thinking, “Why didn’t I just act then?” There’s still time—join this crypto presale before it closes.

Qubetics, Ethereum, and Injective are some of the top contenders. Each offers strong tech, but Qubetics still being in presale gives it a unique upside. When does the Qubetics presale end? Each stage lasts 7 days and ends every Sunday at 12 a.m., with a 10% price increase at every new stage. How high can Qubetics ($TICS) go after presale? Projections estimate $TICS can reach $1 to $15, depending on adoption and mainnet traction. Current ROI estimates go up to 7,783.02%.

Navigating Crypto Market Overwhelmed by Losses With all that, the crypto market in 2025 is on a rollercoaster ride, and lots of investors have devised ways to avoid huge losses and turbulent periods, right now. ​ Tax-loss harvesting is one of the best ways to achieve this, allowing investors to selectively realize capital losses by selling underperforming crypto assets. These losses can be used to offset gains from other investments or reduce taxable income by as much as $3,000 a year, with any excess losses rolled forward to subsequent tax years. U.S. tax laws do not currently apply the wash sale rule to cryptocurrencies, allowing you to repurchase the same asset soon after selling to keep your portfolio positions. Moreover, investors are also diversifying their portfolios by holding cash, investing in ETF, or with reallocating to more stable plays including bitcoin and real estate. Some are picking high-risk low-market-cap projects like leveraged ETFs and speculative altcoins whereas others are interested in long-term projects strong fundamentals. ​ Utilizing techniques such as dollar-cost averaging (DCA), staking, and yield farming in DeFi also can help to smooth out returns during periods of market price declines. In this unstable climate, keeping accurate records, working with tax professionals and keeping abreast of developments in the market should all be key action items for investors who hope to make the most out of losses.

Memecoins have long been misunderstood, and amongst their great utility, there is an emerging perception that memecoins are simply conduits for celebrity-driven pump-and-dump schemes designed to rip the masses off. Despite this perception, and whilst some memecoins have certainly channelled a lot of capital into a small number of hands, this is far from the norm. Many memecoins can, and do, offer utility to users—from fractionalisation to predictive markets. You might also like: The memecoin phenomenon: When jokes print money | Opinion The focus must be on utility More must be done to shift this negative and overriding perception—if this misleading narrative is left to fester and grow, it could risk causing industry-wide damage. The memecoin industry must collectively do more to highlight the unique innovation behind memecoins and their utility for not just the crypto market but broader society, too. To develop projects that demonstrate this, AI is the best co-pilot. The role of AI AI agents are finely tuned to perform specialised tasks and make decisions with minimal or no human intervention, and they are deservedly having their moment in the spotlight. They supersede their less able genAI predecessors thanks to superior flexibility and intelligence, and in recent years, they have entered a transitional phase away from hype, speculation, and experimental novelties towards powerful real-world tools. They have transformed the tech space and are now an everyday tool for many businesses and consumers, applied to all forms of tech from user-facing technologies in self-driving cars to fraud detection technology. Yet the memecoin industry is still to capitalise on the benefits AI agents can offer—developers should harness the potential of AI in the development of their projects. If AI agents are applied in the right way, they offer a smart way to draw out the utility of memecoins and the broader application of AI agents across financial practices. This can be through integrating AI agents into the tokens directly or deploying AI agents to complement memecoin activity. Sophisticated trading tools A key example is the benefit AI agents can bring to memecoin trading tools. AI agents are capable of autonomously monitoring market trends and processing an incredibly high amount of data in a very quick time frame. They can provide real-time market sentiment analysis, adjust investment strategies , and identify market opportunities as the data is shifting, well before other market analysis tools. Applying this to memecoin markets is a no-brainer—this would allow market participants greater transparency amid the huge amount of complex data. There are thousands of memecoins, which cannot be thoroughly analysed by a single human or even a team. Instead, AI can very quickly process information around all memecoins and autonomously allocate accordingly. AROK, the AI-led venture agent, does precisely this—the autonomous trading tool conducts sentiment analysis, which is then used to automatically allocate assets to corresponding memecoins. Security guarantees Going hand in hand with an AI-led trading tool is AI agents’ ability to contribute to security and compliance related to memecoins. Lurking behind the flashy, eye-catching names of some memecoins is a malicious developer planning a rug pull. AI agents can prevent these—they could conduct smart contract auditing, AI-based code reviews, automated fraud detection, and regulatory compliance monitoring. They could conduct real-time risk assessments to identify and respond to emerging anomalies and risky memecoins, key to identifying genuine and viable investment opportunities and preventing pump-and-dumps and scams. Many industries are already using AI agents for detecting financial fraud; the memecoin industry must now take a similar approach. Driving community engagement Memecoins live and die by communities. So, perhaps the most significant benefit AI can bring to memecoins is productive community management. AI agents can accelerate meaningful community growth across an ecosystem through automated community management and the ability to personalise user interactions. AI-driven memecoin ecosystems can autonomously identify and build on trends generated amongst their community, and can also make decisions on behalf of coin holders. Terminal of Truths has successfully done so, capturing attention and driving its on-chain user activity, amassing over 200,000 followers. Memecoins have the power to transform society. But to ensure the industry continues growing, developers must focus on their next iteration to demonstrate genuine utility and overturn negative perceptions drawn from a handful of pump-and-dump schemes. AI agents offer a pragmatic way to do so. The next phase of memecoins shouldn’t be defined by celebrity-manufactured momentum—it should be driven by AI.

This rise follows a slight monthly decline of 0.15%. Over the last six months, ADA’s price has surged by 103.58%, showing strong long-term growth. The recent gain suggests renewed interest. The RSI is at 50.00, indicating a neutral stance. This means the price could move up or down, depending on market activity. ADA is nearing its resistance at $0.745. Breaking above could lead to more gains, possibly over 5%. The support level is at $0.592. Falling below might lead to declines. Polkadot gains nearly 7% in a week In the past week, Polkadot’s price increased by 11.80%, settling between $4.01 and $4.36. This rise comes after a monthly decline of 3.52%. Over the past six months, the price increased minimally by 0.17%, indicating relative stability in the long term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.42. This suggests that the coin is nearing oversold territory but hasn’t reached it yet. An RSI below 30 typically indicates an oversold condition, which could signal a potential price increase as buyers step in. The nearest resistance level is at $4.40. If the price breaks above this point, it could signal further upward movement. The nearest support is at $3.80. If the price falls towards this level, it might find buyers who see it as a bargain. Given the recent weekly gain and the RSI, there’s potential for the price to rise. However, the monthly decline shows that caution is warranted. If the price moves above the resistance level, it could see gains beyond $4.50. Conversely, if it drops below the current range, it might approach the support at $3.31. Conclusion Established coins like ADA and DOT may offer stability. However, these assets might not deliver the rapid gains that some investors are looking for. Codename:Pepe crypto presents a compelling alternative. It utilizes advanced AI to navigate the chaotic memecoin landscape, providing automated trading and exclusive insights through a DAO membership.

Bitcoin shattered the world’s idea of decentralized money. Ethereum redefined what blockchains could build. XRP transformed cross-border finance. Now, a new name is making waves in early circles: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . As the market evolves, these four projects are positioning themselves not just to recover previous highs—but to set new ones. And those paying close attention are seeing the opportunities stacking up fast. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing the Traits of a Future Leader New tokens launch every day—but few gain the kind of serious early traction that MAGACOINFINANCE is earning right now. From rapid wallet growth to expanding community conversations, this project is moving through its early phases with uncommon efficiency. The leadership team is delivering. The engagement is rising. And critically, smart investors are moving in while the mass market is still looking elsewhere. The blueprint is clear: build quietly, grow strategically, and scale when the foundation is strong. MAGACOINFINANCE is executing exactly on that path—and it’s why many believe it could be the next token to create new milestones. Supporting Momentum: Tron, Sei, and the New Builders Tron remains a transaction powerhouse. With one of the highest usage rates in terms of on-chain activity, Tron keeps expanding across emerging markets where low-cost, high-speed transactions are essential. Sei is making noise as a trading-first blockchain designed for speed and efficiency. Its early infrastructure has attracted developers looking for optimized performance in financial applications. Both platforms are creating important pieces of the next Web3 landscape—but they’ve already moved past their pure early-stage window. MAGACOINFINANCE is still there—and that’s where the greatest opportunity lives. Final Word Can XRP , Ethereum , Bitcoin , and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM surpass their previous milestones?

In a notable move, a whale withdrew $20 million worth of ADA from exchanges on April 24—historically a bullish signal that often precedes major price rallies. Whale Withdrawal: $20 million ADA moved off exchanges Current Market Cap: ~$24.68 billion 24-Hour Trading Volume: $540.9 million JUST IN: More than 20 million $ADA has been pulled from exchanges in the last 7 days—pointing to rising accumulation and long-term confidence in Cardano. pic.twitter.com/5Kow3irQs6 — TapTools (@TapTools) April 24, 2025 ADA remains supported above its key 50-day EMA ($0.6867), and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 38 suggests there’s still room for buyers to push higher. These technicals, combined with shrinking exchange supply, point to a setup where a sustained move above $1 could finally be within reach. Hydra Upgrade and DeFi Expansion Boost Fundamentals; Cardano Supported Beyond whale movements, Cardano’s ongoing protocol upgrades are enhancing its long-term strength. Hydra, the layer-2 scaling solution, successfully executed its first mainnet transaction batch, dramatically improving transaction speed and positioning Cardano as a serious player in high-frequency decentralized applications (dApps). Meanwhile, Mithril—a lightweight data certification protocol—is improving the wallet user experience by reducing sync times, making onboarding smoother for new users.

Hydra Rollout: Sub-second transaction settlements achieved Mithril Upgrade: Faster, lighter wallet syncs DeFi Boost: 21% APY on stablecoin lending via Begin Wallet This layered growth story strengthens Cardano’s appeal beyond just price speculation, supporting a foundation for a potential $1+ breakout. Cardano Faces Make-or-Break Resistance at $1 Despite bullish developments, ADA faces a critical technical barrier. The $0.99–$1.00 resistance zone aligns with a major descending trendline from February highs. Although ADA reclaimed its 50-day EMA, the MACD momentum is flattening, suggesting a cautious approach is still necessary. For traders, this is a textbook “breakout or fakeout” moment. A confirmed move above $1 with strong volume could open the door toward $1.05–$1.12. However, failure to clear this zone risks a pullback toward $0.6620 or even $0.5950. Trade Plan: Buy breakout: Above $1.00 Upside targets: $1.05 and $1.12 Sell on breakdown: Below $0.6860 Downside targets: $0.6620 and $0.5950 Stop-loss: Below $0.6860 for longs, above $1.00 for shorts Patience remains key—confirmation is essential before taking positions at major psychological levels like $1. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5M Milestone as 81% Yield Boosts Staking Demand Investor momentum behind BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) remains strong, with the Ethereum-based project officially surpassing the $5 million mark in its ongoing presale. As of today, $5.05 million has been raised out of a $5.74 million target, signaling rising urgency among buyers as the next price jump approaches. The current token price stands at $0.00248, offering a limited window before another repricing. High-Yield Staking with Flexible Access BTCBULL continues to set itself apart from typical meme assets by focusing on sustainable utility. The project’s staking program offers an estimated 81% annual yield, complemented by Bitcoin-backed distribution rewards. Crucially, users retain full liquidity with the ability to unstake anytime—no mandatory lockup periods or penalties. Latest Staking Snapshot: Total Tokens Staked: 1,293,025,857 BTCBULL Estimated Annual Yield: 81% APY Unstaking: Available at any time This flexible structure appeals to both yield hunters and investors seeking upside potential without giving up liquidity. Presale Snapshot: Final Stretch Before Repricing With less than $683,000 left before the next price adjustment, BTCBULL’s presale is rapidly entering its final stages at the current rate. Investors are securing positions before the project’s valuation steps higher. Presale Metrics (Updated): Token Price: $0.00248 USDT Raised: $5,058,002.58 out of $5,741,234 target BTCBULL combines an aggressive yield model with meme-token upside, carving out a niche for investors looking for more than just speculative trading.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Memecoin fever is sweeping the crypto market as TRUMP surges on political hype and XYZVerse eyes a 30x breakout. Table of Contents Top TRUMP holders to meet US president XYZVerse on the memecoin spotlight: Bold concept and listing plans Conclusion: Memecoin momentum is back Memecoins are the wildest play in the crypto market. What are they? Just a joke, some would say. However, history knows real cases where a memecoin surged thousands of percent. Ask a SHIB holder who watched their $4,500 investment surge to nearly $15 million. But wait — there’s an even more stunning story. The cost of a pizza, just $27, turned into $52 million in the hands of a savvy PEPE investor. Today, memecoins are evolving beyond the promise of huge profits. They are coming with real-world perks, like landing a dinner with a president. Top TRUMP holders to meet US president The much-talked-about TRUMP memecoin just turned into a golden ticket. The project recently announced on its website that the top 220 TRUMP holders will have the opportunity to access an exclusive dinner with President Donald Trump. Boosted by this news, the TRUMP coin surged over 80% and its daily trading volume jumped over 500%. The price spiked to above $15 from around $8. TRUMP price analysis The TRUMP token is currently approaching its first resistance at $15.31. A break and close above this level would be a significant bullish trigger, likely drawing fresh buying interest from traders looking to ride the momentum. Should TRUMP clear this resistance decisively, the next target would be at $20.61. However, failure to break through the first resistance could result in a short-term consolidation in the $9.00–$12.00 range before another breakout attempt. The TRUMP memecoin has broken into the headlines and made much noise. But behind this noise, another memecoin project is building momentum, and its launch could be a sensation judging by the enthusiasm of its community. You might also like: SUI or SEI: Which one will dominate the 2025 bull market? AI has a radical take XYZVerse on the memecoin spotlight: Bold concept and listing plans XYZVerse has come under the spotlight as the first-ever all-sports memecoin. This fresh concept is appealing to a large user base; from sports fans to crypto enthusiasts. This is the first reason XYZVerse stands out in the crowded memecoin space. Currently in presale, XYZ tokens are offered at $0.003333, a fraction of the planned listing price of $0.10. For early investors, this creates a high-upside opportunity. A presale participant putting in $100 could walk away with roughly $3,000 once the token hits exchanges assuming it lists at the projected 10-cent mark. That’s nearly 30-times growth before the token starts its post-listing journey. With the right combination of hype, community support, and exchange momentum, XYZ could push far beyond its initial target, offering early holders an even bigger windfall. XYZ builds strong momentum ahead of listing XYZVerse is charging toward its public debut with impressive momentum. Now in Stage 12 of 15, the presale has already raised over $13 million. XYZVerse has quickly become a hot topic across Reddit, CoinMarketCap, and other crypto communities, where influencers and early backers are actively discussing its potential. Some users have been posting rather optimistic predictions for XYZVerse. Positive sentiment at this level is a powerful indicator, especially as the presale moves into its final phases. With Stage 13 approaching fast, the token price is set to rise to $0.005, inching closer to the projected $0.10 listing price. How to buy XYZ in presale XYZVerse is currently in its presale phase, and the only way to buy is directly through the project’s official website . Step 1: Set up a crypto wallet To participate in the presale, users need a crypto wallet. Users who don’t already have one, can easily download the app and create a wallet. Step 2: Add the right network Once the wallet is ready, users need to ensure it’s set to the correct blockchain network. XYZVerse supports multiple chains, including Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Tron, Solana, Polygon, and BNB Smart Chain (BSC). In MetaMask, go to Settings, Networks, Add Network, and enter the relevant network details. Some networks may already be available by default. XYZ can also be bought with Visa or Mastercard for those who prefer fiat payments. Step 3: Connect the wallet to XYZVerse Head over to the official XYZVerse website and open the dApp interface. Click on “Connect Wallet” and select the wallet in use. Approve the connection through the wallet prompt. Step 4: Select the payment token Click the token dropdown and choose the preferred currency. XYZVerse accepts popular cryptos like USDT, ETH, BNB, and others. Make sure there’s enough balance to cover both the token purchase and gas fees. Step 5: Enter the amount to buy Users can either input the amount of XYZ tokens they want to buy or specify how much crypto they’d like to spend. The system will auto-calculate the equivalent amount. Step 6: Confirm and finalize the purchase Once everything looks good, hit the “Buy XYZ” button. A confirmation screen will come from the wallet. Approve the transaction, and that’s it. The XYZ tokens will appear in the balance once the transaction is complete. Final tip Always double-check that it’s the official XYZVerse website to avoid scams or fake presale pages. Bookmark the site and only use verified links from trusted sources. Conclusion: Memecoin momentum is back If there’s one thing the crypto world never runs short of, its surprises — and memecoins are back in the spotlight with full force. Between TRUMP blazing ahead with political energy and headline hype, and XYZVerse turning heads with its presale buzz and potential 30x returns, two different stories are unfolding — but both are riding the same wave of meme-fueled momentum. TRUMP has already demonstrated how fast things can move when narrative meets market appetite. It’s unpredictable, wild, and driven by sentiment, but that’s the nature of memecoins. On the other hand, XYZVerse is playing the long game. Building quietly, stage by stage, with a growing community that’s betting big on its potential before it even hits the exchanges. But as with any early-stage crypto project, especially in the memecoin and hype-driven categories, risk is part of the equation. Presales can be volatile, and not every project achieves its listing goals or long-term viability. To learn more about XYZVerse, visit their website , Telegram , or X .

Listed under the ticker XRPH11, the fund has begun trading on Brazil’s B3 exchange. XRPH11, which tracks the Nasdaq XRP Reference Price Index, is designed to allocate at least 95% of its net assets directly to XRP. Hashdex noted that exposure to XRP can be achieved through direct coin ownership, futures contracts that replicate the index’s performance, or other financial instruments that mirror Nasdaq’s benchmark. XRP Spot ETFs have not yet been approved in the US, but Bloomberg analysts believe that many altcoin ETFs, including XRP, will eventually gain approval under the Trump administration. This launch marks Hashdex’s ninth ETF offering in B3, expanding its single-asset crypto ETF lineup that already includes products linked to Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Related News: Will History Repeat Itself in Bitcoin (BTC)? Expert Analysts Give Their Predictions According to Samir Kerbage, chief investment officer of Hashdex, the new ETF aims to attract sophisticated investors and institutions looking to build cryptocurrency portfolios within the framework of Brazil’s regulated stock market. Kerbage argued that XRPH11 complies with regulatory standards on fund security and transparency, and expands investors’ access to digital assets. *This is not investment advice.

Trading for less than a dollar, these four tokens show signs of significant growth ahead. This article explores why these affordable digital assets might be on the verge of explosive gains, highlighting the factors that could propel them upward in the near future. Investor Demand Powers $XYZ Capitalization to the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $10 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. $XYZ Charging up for a Championship Run With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Terra Classic: Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain Innovation Terra Classic (LUNC) has carved its niche in the cryptocurrency world by blending stability with innovation. Originally launched in April 2019, Terra is a blockchain platform that uses stablecoins linked to traditional currencies. This means it offers digital coins that match the value of currencies like the U.S. dollar, South Korean won, and even the Mongolian tugrik. By doing this, Terra provides a way to make fast and affordable payments worldwide, without the wild price swings often seen in other cryptocurrencies. In May 2022, Terra entered a new phase when it launched a new chain and rebranded from its Terra Classic narrative. Its native token became LUNA Classic (LUNC), in a move reminiscent of the 2017 Ethereum-Ethereum Classic split. Terra Classic was supposed to offer the best of both worlds: promote adoption of traditional money and popularize the decentralized strengths of blockchain technology. Fast forward to today. The market has changed so much, but LUNC still represents an interesting option for traders looking for a combination of stability and some other advantages crypto offers. While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum capture headlines with their volatility, Terra Classic focuses on steady growth and real-world usability, which could make it an appealing choice for many investors. Stellar Lumens Bridges a Chasm in Global Payment Systems Stellar Lumens (XLM) is changing the way we think about moving money around the world. Launched in 2014, Stellar is a decentralized network that uses blockchain to make fast and cheap transfers possible. Unlike some cryptocurrencies that aim to replace banks, Stellar works to connect different financial systems. It doesn’t favor any one currency. Instead, it allows any type of money—dollars, euros, bitcoins—to move across its network with ease. Big companies have noticed; they’ve partnered with Stellar to take advantage of its technology. With billions of transactions processed, Stellar shows that blockchain can work hand-in-hand with traditional finance. Stellar appears to be in a promising position in the current market, shining based on its advantages in terms of real-world solutions. While some cryptocurrencies struggle to settle in a niche, Stellar has consolidated its reputation in enhancing everyday money-handling solutions, offering tools and simple apps for people to send funds globally. Businesses can also use Stellar to create blockchain apps or run currency exchanges. Kaspa’s BlockDAG Revolution: A Faster Future for Cryptocurrency Kaspa is a relatively new entrant into the digital finance space, running a proof-of-work system like Bitcoin, but with an important wrinkle. Instead of building blocks one after another, Kaspa allows simultaneous block creation. It then uses its GHOSTDAG protocol to ensure these parallel blocks aren’t discarded; rather, they are arranged based on consensus that form a blockDAG—a network that looks more like a web than a chain. That is how Kaspa runs a system that can process blocks faster than any available alternatives. It currently completes one transaction per second, but efficiency goals are set at ten or even a hundred per second. Kaspa’s technology makes a strong case in a market where quick transaction finality is key. Features like data pruning and plans for layer 2 solutions make it appealing to both developers and users. Kaspa also has a solid foundation to build upon. Conclusion LUNC, XLM, and KAS look primed for growth, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out above them all. The unique sports memecoin with a community-driven ecosystem has a historic upside that makes 20,000% gains look like a realistic target.

After rallying 17.7% this week, DOGE now boasts a $27.8 billion market cap—leapfrogging Cardano (ADA) to reclaim a top spot among major cryptocurrencies. Despite a minor 1.4% dip in the past 24 hours, Dogecoin is trading around $0.1810 on April 27, holding strong after a major breakout move. The technical landscape shows Dogecoin exiting a falling wedge pattern, typically a bullish setup. Strong support has formed around $0.143 and $0.16, providing a sturdy foundation for further gains as bullish sentiment continues to build. Dogecoin Defends Trendline as Bulls Eye $0.24 Technically , Dogecoin remains well-supported above a rising trendline formed since mid-April, with the 50 EMA ($0.1788) offering additional stability. Immediate resistance sits at $0.1878. A breakout above this level could open the door for a test of $0.1929, with a broader push toward $0.24 if momentum holds. #Dogecoin holding firm at $0.1810, defending key trendline support. A breakout above $0.1878 could trigger a rally toward $0.1929 and $0.24. Support to watch: $0.1788. Momentum building — patience key before confirmation. $DOGE pic.twitter.com/OUq7DW6D1Z — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) April 27, 2025 Trade Plan: Buy breakout: Above $0.1878 Upside target: $0.1929 and $0.24 Support zone: $0.1788 Stop-loss: Below $0.1740 For beginners, this setup is known as “trendline defense”—buyers step in along rising support to maintain upward momentum. Patience is critical: only act after a clean breakout with strong volume confirmation. Dogecoin: Analysts See Potential Run Toward $1 in 2025 Market analysts, including Trader Tardigrade , believe Dogecoin could mirror its historic rallies, targeting a potential move toward $1 by May 2025. Achieving that would propel Dogecoin’s market cap closer to $100 billion, recreating the euphoria seen during its 2021 bull run. The Dogecoin price looks set to witness a breakout above the psychological $1 level, having broken a resistance trendline. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade provided a timeline for when this massive surge could happen as DOGE rallies to a new all-time high (ATH). pic.twitter.com/Ex2jISusss — Lu Chunquan (@LChunquan) April 27, 2025 Several catalysts support this bullish view: Bitcoin nearing $94K, lifting the broader market mood. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP registering double-digit weekly gains. Surging retail interest and increased whale accumulation. However, Dogecoin must first clear critical resistance at $0.24 to unlock larger gains. Final Outlook: Strong Base, but Breakout Confirmation Needed Dogecoin’s fundamentals are strengthening, and its market cap dominance signals renewed investor interest. But the road to higher prices hinges on clearing immediate resistance. A confirmed move above $0.1878, backed by volume, could be the spark for a run toward $0.24—and beyond. Until then, cautious optimism remains the smart play. Solana’s First L2? Solaxy Hits $31.91M as Presale Nears $32.6M Goal After Dogecoin’s trendline bounce shows traders chasing short-term momentum, attention is quietly shifting toward deeper infrastructure plays—especially within the Solana ecosystem. While Bitcoin dominates institutional headlines, innovation on Solana is heating up with one Layer-2 project leading the charge. Solaxy Bridges Solana and Ethereum Solaxy (SOLX) is directly tackling Solana’s congestion challenge by processing transactions off-chain and submitting them back to the mainnet in bundles. A built-in bridge with Ethereum enables seamless cross-chain interoperability, reducing fees and boosting network efficiency without sacrificing security. By bundling transactions before submission, Solaxy alleviates load on Solana’s base layer while maintaining decentralization. Its cross-chain bridge further strengthens user flexibility, allowing assets to move smoothly between ecosystems—positioning Solaxy as an infrastructure backbone for multi-chain applications. Presale Update: Momentum Accelerates Solaxy’s presale continues to build momentum, now surpassing $31.91 million out of its $32.59 million target. With the next price adjustment fast approaching, SOLX remains priced at $0.001706—up from its earlier $0.0016 phase. Presale Snapshot (as of now): Current Token Price: $0.001706 USDT Raised: $31,919,230.80 out of $32,593,211 Solaxy has been audited by Coinsult and is backed by over 60,000 followers on X and 11,500 Telegram subscribers. Its strong community support, combined with real technical utility, has made it one of the top-watched presale projects in the Solana ecosystem. With momentum building and the funding goal nearly complete, Solaxy is positioning itself not just as another token launch, but as a serious player in solving real infrastructure challenges for Web3.

ZKsync recovered $5.7M from a hack, and the SEC postponed decisions on Polkadot and Hedera ETFs amid rising regulatory activity. Let’s find out more. Bitcoin The U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs bought another sizable amount of BTC on Thursday, bringing the total inflow so far this week to 29.45K BTC, equivalent to $2.65 billion. Business Stripe , a global payments platform, is building its first stablecoin financial product for companies based outside the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe to expand the footprint of the Dollar in global markets. Coinbase, the largest publicly listed cryptocurrency exchange, has announced that it will waive transaction fees for trades involving PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD. The move, part of a wider strategic collaboration between the two firms, aims to promote the adoption of stablecoins in mainstream payment systems and digital commerce. Trump Media has partnered with Crypto.com and Yorkville America Digital to launch a series of “Made in America” crypto-focused ETFs under its Truth.Fi brand, marking its formal entry into the digital asset investment market. Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered are considering expanding their crypto operations into the United States, driven by favorable regulatory developments, client demand, and long-term strategic positioning. Tokyo-listed Metaplanet has purchased an additional 330 BTC worth $28.2 million, lifting its total holdings to over $423 million and positioning it as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder. Web3 Verifiable AI is becoming a palpable trend as public awareness of the downsides of black-box AI grows. Decentralized money markets allow users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets on-chain, and they need nothing but an internet connection. Alongside the growth of DeFi in general, these markets have been a rapidly growing use case of smart contracts, with all the latter's pluses and minuses. Security The ZKsync Association has successfully recovered approximately $5.7 million worth of digital assets following a security breach earlier this month. The resolution came after the hacker responsible for the incident accepted a bounty offer and returned the majority of the stolen tokens within a designated timeframe. A critical security incident has compromised a widely used software library in the Ripple XRP ecosystem, putting thousands of crypto wallets at risk. Regulation The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended its decision deadlines for two crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals tied to Polkadot (DOT) and Hedera (HBAR), as the agency continues to navigate an expanding pipeline of digital asset fund applications. Russia’s finance ministry and central bank are moving forward with plans to establish a state-backed cryptocurrency exchange exclusively for the country’s wealthiest investors.

43863231,https://timestabloid.com/?p=65137,1745751613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Cardano (ADA) Fans Abandon $10 Dream After Emerging Analysis Proves It Impossible, While Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Continues to Attract Investors",https://timestabloid.com/cardano-ada-fans-abandon-10-dream-after-emerging-analysis/,"Analysis reveals that ADA token supporters face an unpleasant fact because research dismisses the possibility of ADA reaching $10 during the period of 2031. Cardano maintains a weekly increase of 14.99% as its price stands at $0.69 but resilience stems from whale accumulation along with positive technical patterns. Analysis shows $1.03 will be the maximum price for ADA in 2025 because DeFi adoption has slowed down and NFT popularity remains limited. The investor community strongly focuses on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as its fourth stage presale moves forward at $0.025 per token to raise $7.2 million from 9,100 investors who purchased 425 million tokens. The presale phase of MUTM’s token is at phase 4 at $0.025 per token has overall attracted $7.2 million investment from 9,100 holders who acquired 425 million tokens. The cryptocurrency market is currently favoring practical-use projects as demonstrated by this rapid increase in adoption. Cardano’s Fading Momentum Cardano remains a bright prospect because whale investors keep buying large token quantities throughout market declines thereby reinforcing market belief. The Relative Strength Index stands at 57 indicating an upward market trend while analysts predict that $0.80 will serve as a crucial price target. Integration with BitcoinOS and potential ETF approval spark long-term hope. However, challenges loom large. Market participants are taking profits from Cardano based on recent large whale transactions of 180 million tokens and falling Mean Dollar Invested Age indicators. Cardano faces a weak outlook because it fails to expand its DeFi and NFT sectors effectively. The declining hopes for reaching $10 price target have steered investors to evaluate promising tokens including Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance’s Presale The crypto market has turned its attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because of its phase 4 presale at $0.025. The 11-phase plan sells through this current stage at a fast pace due to investor panic about stock depletion. Purchasers who invest at phase 4 will earn 20 percent in profit once phase 5 starts at $0.03. New coin distribution strategies establish a $0.06 target price that provides investors with a 140% profitable outcome. According to experts MUTM tokens will increase to $2.50 after launch which would provide a 9,900% ROI benefit. A new dashboard introduction revealed the positions of the top 50 token holders who receive additional rewards for keeping their rankings so that user engagement keeps growing. Security and Utility Drive Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team members actively work on obtaining a smart contract audit through CertiK while placing trust at the forefront of their priorities. The finished security results will be distributed through social media platforms to strengthen investor trust. The decentralized lending structure of the project provides real value for users who can obtain yield from their assets or use their assets as collateral. The buy-and-distribute system uses platform revenue to purchase and sustain the demand for tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a strategic DeFi entrance through its $7.2 million funding and 9,100 investor base which establishes it as different from the gradual Cardano DeFi marketplace advancement. Shifting Tides in Crypto The projected $10 value of Cardano faces major obstacles which make that value goal difficult or impossible to achieve. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting investors because it offers entry into its presale at affordable rates together with solid returns. Phase 4 investors who buy their MUTM tokens for $0.025 should recognize this price point as a temporary opportunity because phase 5 will introduce a 20% increase to future token values.

The former candidate for the US Senate to represent Massachusetts believes Bankman-Fried deserved every year of his punishment and even called for his parents to be charged. Some claim Bankman-Fried’s 25-year sentence was excessive One crypto community member sparked a debate over Bankman-Fried’s sentence. In an X post, he pointed out that the FTX founder’s punishment was too harsh. He argued that the exchange’s users were being compensated in full plus interest. He continued that the exchange was not entirely bankrupt, and only had liquidity issues. He even believes that the FTX scandal was not a case of deliberate, malicious fraud, but reckless mismanagement fueled by ideologies like utilitarianism and effective altruism. His comments, however, were not taken lightly, and some criticized him for defending SBF. Nonetheless, the account going by “Zach” clarified that he did not believe the FTX founder was innocent, only that he found a 25-year sentence without parole for mismanagement and poor decisions excessive. Attorney John Deaton believes SBF’s parents should be in jail Contrary to Zach, John Deaton claimed that SBF’s sentence was justified, believing he deserved his 25-year sentence. Deaton even went as far as to say SBF’s parents should have been charged. Responding to Zach’s X post, he remarked, “Not only did he deserve the 25 years, his father, Joe Bankman, and his mother, Barbara Fried, also deserve to be in prison. Even his so-called altruism was fraudulent, proven by evidence submitted at trial in the form of his private messages.” Deaton added that Bankman-Fried has yet to show any remorse for any of his crimes. Moreover, he argued that the campaign finance fraud charges against SBF should never have been dismissed. He even called for Pam Bondi, Florida’s former Attorney General, to reopen the case. He asserted that the charges were only dropped because the case involved several elected officials. He claimed SBF even contributed $10 million to the Biden administration, after which the former SEC chair Gary Gensler met with him multiple times. Nevertheless, some crypto community members believe Sam Bankman-Fried could receive leniency since federal prosecutors and regulators have lessened their grip on crypto cases. Lately, regulators have been paying more attention to crimes linked to crypto assets, leaving the rest in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s hands. Speaking with commentator and host Tucker Carlson, Bankman-Fried acknowledged that he could stay in jail until his late fifties without any intervention. However, the shifting dynamic in Washington leaves hope that he could be pardoned, as was the case with ex-BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes. Bankman-Fried was recently shifted to the low-security Terminal Island Federal Correctional Institution. Before that, he was located at the Victorville medium-security facility, a notoriously violent place, according to prison consultant firm Elizabeth Franklin-Best. Samuel Goldfaden, a partner at the crypto-centric law firm DLT Law, said that while his previous facility was violent, Bankman-Fried had been held in a safer part of the facility. According to Goldfaden, Sam Bankman-Fried spent most of his detention in the more secure dorm units of MDC Brooklyn, reportedly alongside other high-profile inmates such as Sean P. Diddy to ensure his safety. Terminal Island, which once housed notorious mobster Al Capone, American criminal and cult leader Charles Manson, and LSD advocate Timothy Leary, currently accommodates over 900 inmates, including other convicted fraudsters like video game entrepreneur Mouli Cohen.

As Bitcoin (BTC) continues its surge, Solana (SOL) drives blockchain innovation, and XRP pushes adoption, smart investors are quietly expanding their focus to strategic early entries. One project now gaining real traction is MAGACOINFINANCE —a rare opportunity still positioned before the mainstream floodgates open. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Being Positioned for Major Growth in 2025 In a cycle increasingly driven by early discovery, MAGACOINFINANCE is standing out for all the right reasons. With strong early traction, disciplined expansion, and real community growth, it’s moving onto major radar screens across trader groups and analyst circles. Based on current momentum, structural design, and early accumulation behavior, MAGACOINFINANCE is being confidently projected into the 55x potential tier by early trackers—an upside many believe could mirror previous stealth-phase breakouts like Solana and XRP. Other Noteworthy Movers: SOL, INJ, KAS, and UNI Solana (SOL) continues leading Layer-1 innovation with speed and developer adoption. Injective (INJ) is carving a niche with its high-performance trading protocols. Kaspa (KAS) is gaining attention for its unique blockDAG architecture. Uniswap (UNI) remains the backbone of decentralized exchange infrastructure. While these projects are strong, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the rarest edge—early positioning where future momentum is still fully ahead. Final Word In crypto, fortunes are made by those who position early, not those who follow late.

Ossoff, a Democrat currently seeking reelection, cited concerns over Trump’s involvement with a cryptocurrency project tied to his name. Ossoff Criticizes Trump Speaking to attendees, Ossoff criticized Trump’s plan to host a private dinner for the top holders of the Official Trump memecoin. “I mean, I saw just 48 hours ago, he is granting audiences to people who buy his meme coin,” Ossoff said, according to a report by NBC News. “When the sitting president of the United States is selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him, there is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense,” he added. However, the Senator acknowledged that impeachment would be unlikely without a shift in Congressional power. At present, Trump’s Republican Party holds a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Ossoff suggested that real movement toward impeachment could only happen if Democrats gain control of Congress during the 2026 midterm elections. The controversy stems from an announcement made on April 23 via the Official Trump memecoin website. It revealed plans for an exclusive dinner at Trump’s Washington , D.C., golf club, inviting the top 220 TRUMP token holders. The website also launched a leaderboard to track wallet rankings and provided a registration link for potential attendees. Following the news, the price of the TRUMP token surged over 50%, according to CoinMarketCap data. While the guest list remains uncertain, the website specifies that participants must pass a background check, cannot hail from countries on Know Your Customer (KYC) watchlists, and are not permitted to bring guests. Experts Raise Alarm On April 25, the team behind TRUMP addressed rumors circulating online that individuals would need at least $300,000 worth of tokens to attend. They clarified that the cutoff should be determined using the leaderboard, excluding locked tokens, exchange holdings, and non-participating wallets. Meanwhile, legal experts have raised alarms about Trump’s deeper involvement in the crypto space. Charlyn Ho, a partner at law firm Rikka, warned that Trump’s personal financial interests through ventures like the TRUMP memecoin and the Trump-linked DeFi protocol World Liberty Financial could present serious conflicts of interest , particularly as the president signs executive orders impacting the digital assets sector.

While price volatility has settled, there’s still no sign of a strong recovery. Adding to the frustration, crypto payment platform Banxa has reportedly paused Pi transactions, likely due to pending Know Your Business (KYB) approval. Banxa previously purchased millions of Pi at low prices and may return once approval is granted and Pi’s price improves. Meanwhile, it’s been over two months since Pi Network won Binance’s community vote by a wide margin, yet the token remains unlisted. Hope sparked again on April 25, when Binance released new listing guidelines, prompting fresh speculation. Binance’s new evaluation framework stresses strong fundamentals, adoption metrics, tokenomics, team credibility, and compliance. For projects like Pi, which already have a circulating token, special attention is given to trading volume, liquidity, and market performance. However, major challenges remain. Pi is not yet operating on any of the four blockchains currently supported by Binance (BNB Chain, Solana, Base, and Ethereum). Without integration into a supported chain or a clear timeline for expansion, Pi’s path to a Binance listing remains uncertain. Pi Coin Price Prediction? Pi is currently trading in a tight range, with price compressing inside a wedge pattern. Key resistance is at $0.65, and a confirmed breakout above $0.65—especially with strong volume—could spark a sharp rally. However, if the price fails to break above this level, it may fall back to test support around $0.60. Crypto analyst Dr Altcoin said, “Pi is doing well! I am fairly confident that the price pumping of Pi might start during the Consensus Summit (May 14–16, 2025) rather than at the end of August when Pi unlocking significantly reduces.”",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-27 11:08:34

Mantra ( OM ), a major player in the Real World Asset tokenization, traded at $0.5086 on Sunday, down 95% from its highest level this year. This performance indicates that investors are still skeptical about the coin after its crash two weeks ago. While the management has attributed the collapse to forced liquidations by an exchange, users believe it was because of insiders dumping tokens . They question why Mantra was the only coin to have such forced liquidations.

In addition to Mulln’s token burn, the company will burn 300 OM tokens from its Treasury. A token burn reduces the number of those in circulation and potentially boosts its price. Mantra has also hopes to implement a $109 million token buyback. A buyback increases demand for tokens and can help to stabilize its price. The team has also pledged to implement more transparency. However, it is unlikely that these actions will be effective because the trust among investors is gone . OM price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the OM price collapsed earlier this month. It dropped from a high of $9.10 in March to $0.50 today, erasing over $7.5 billion in value. The Mantra price has crumbled below all moving averages, a sign that bears remain in control. It has also formed a bearish pennant pattern, which consists of a vertical line and a triangle pattern. Therefore, while the Mantra coin may seem cheap, there is a likelihood that it will continue falling over time. It may drop to the next point at $0.2330, the lowest swing in February last year. The only caveat is that failed projects like Celsius, FTX, and Safemoon often experience short squeezes.

Arctic Pablo Coin Hits Stage 20 with $2.33M Raised—Will Ponke and Cat Keep Up?,https://timestabloid.com/from-0-000099-to-the-moon-arctic-pablo-coin-hits-stage-20/,"Ever felt like you missed the boat on the last big meme coin? With the market heating up again, three names are turning heads and wallets—each for different reasons. While most investors chase hype, the smart ones dig deeper, looking for mechanisms and movements that spell long-term potential. This week, Ponke broke into the top trending tokens with a new community-driven reward system, while Cat in a Dog’s World stunned analysts with its record engagement across Solana. But nothing is gathering steam quite like Arctic Pablo Coin (APC)—a newcomer blending humor, narrative-driven presale mechanics, and a deflationary model that has serious investors paying attention. This article dives into the latest developments surrounding Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Ponke, and Cat in a Dog’s World. But spoiler alert: APC is stealing the spotlight—and here’s why. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflation Drive: Weekly Token Burns Making $APC a Scarce Gem Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just riding the meme wave—it’s rewriting the playbook with a burn strategy designed to tighten supply and elevate long-term value. This deflationary mechanism involves permanently removing all unsold tokens every single week during its presale phase. That’s not a one-time burn—it’s a recurring process that drastically reduces circulating supply. What makes this approach even more intriguing is its on-chain transparency. Each burn is recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), providing visible, irreversible proof of token elimination. Once the presale wraps, all leftover tokens will meet the same fiery fate, amplifying scarcity and potentially boosting value over time. It’s a bold move that sets $APC apart in a saturated meme coin presale market—and it may just be one of the best crypto to invest in before the final stage hits. Frostbite City Frenzy: Arctic Pablo Coin Hits Stage 20 at $0.000099 Arctic Pablo Coin’s epic presale journey has just reached its 20th milestone—Frostbite City—and crypto circles are buzzing. The meme coin presale model it follows doesn’t rely on traditional stages. Instead, Arctic Pablo “travels” through imaginative locations, each unlocking new pricing tiers. What’s astonishing is how fast the previous 19 stages wrapped up—each phase sold out sooner than expected. Now priced at just $0.000099, APC is in its 20th location, offering a staggering ROI of 7969.70% compared to the final listing price of $0.008. So far, the campaign has raised over $2.33 million, and with momentum accelerating, the current price may not last long. As each new “city” arrives, price levels shift upward. Frostbite City could close at any moment, marking this as potentially the final chance to enter the meme coin presale at such a low entry point. This Arctic expedition isn’t just another meme project—it might be the best crypto to invest in this season. Ponke Unveils Layered Rewards Protocol Amid Rapid User Growth Ponke is surging this week after announcing its highly anticipated Layered Rewards Protocol, a new mechanism that allows long-term holders to stake tokens across tiered levels to earn exclusive benefits. The community-backed meme coin has witnessed a sharp rise in wallet activity and liquidity since the update, with over 25,000 active addresses engaging with the token in the past 48 hours. This uptick follows news that several major Solana-based influencers have joined the Ponke movement, pushing its visibility beyond meme territory and into what some are calling a utility-driven shift. Cat in a Dog’s World Launches NFT-Based Utility Bridge Cat in a Dog’s World just released an NFT-based utility bridge, enabling holders to convert their NFTs into staking assets that grant governance voting power and yield rewards. The update has resonated deeply within the Solana ecosystem, with a 37% spike in active users and over 18,000 new NFT conversions in just three days. As the project pivots toward ecosystem-building, the development suggests a clear trajectory toward sustainable tokenomics while maintaining its satirical charm. Verdict: Which Coin is Leading the Charge? Each of these three meme tokens is bringing fresh energy to the market—Ponke with gamified rewards, Cat in a Dog’s World with NFT staking—but Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is making the loudest splash right now. With its strategic meme coin presale, innovative location-based rollout, and aggressive weekly token burns, it offers a mix of storytelling and scarcity that’s rare to see in this genre. For those seeking the best crypto to invest in before prices leap forward, Arctic Pablo Coin might just be the last train to catch—and it’s already halfway to the station. Don’t miss out while Frostbite City is still open. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions What is Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) and how does its presale work? Arctic Pablo Coin is a meme coin featuring a location-based presale model where each new stage introduces a higher token price. Why is Arctic Pablo Coin burning tokens during the presale? To boost scarcity and value, APC eliminates all unsold tokens weekly, creating a deflationary supply that supports long-term growth. What is the current stage of the Arctic Pablo Coin presale? The presale is currently in Stage 20, known as Frostbite City, with the token priced at $0.000099. How much has Arctic Pablo Coin raised so far? The project has already raised over $2.33 million through its meme coin presale. Is Arctic Pablo Coin the best crypto to invest in 2025? With its unique presale structure, token burns, and community-driven hype, many consider it one of the best crypto opportunities this year.

This level is considered highly important in both technical trading and natural patterns, and often marks strong turning points in price. Bitcoin reaching this level suggests the recent rally may be slowing down, and traders are watching closely to see what happens next. So far, Bitcoin has shown signs of a possible five-wave move from its April low. If this pattern completes, it would be a clear sign of bullish strength and could open the door for further gains. However, if the move turns out to be only a three-wave structure, it may mean that the market is still in a broader bear trend, and this recent rise was just a temporary recovery. Key support for the current trend is between $84,526 and $88,494. As long as the price stays above this zone, the outlook remains positive in the short term. There is also a minor support zone between $91,047 and $93,581 that could help hold the price up in the coming days. Traders should keep an eye on these levels. If Bitcoin can hold above support and break past the $94,250 resistance with strong momentum, the next target could be as high as $130,000 in the longer term.

But for those chasing asymmetric gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight. Investors are currently purchasing MUTM tokens at presale for $0.025, and over $7.2 million has been raised so far. Over 9,100 participants are already onboard, and many predict the price will shift to $0.03 in the next presale phase. Investors who join now can realize a 140% gain upon the token hitting the projected launch price of $0.06. That same $1,000 placed in MUTM could balloon into a staggering $50,000, according to bullish forecasts fueled by whale accumulation and rising DeFi traction. While XRP offers reliability, MUTM is drawing those who don’t just want gains—they want a game-changer. Mutuum Finance Presale: A New DeFi Platform Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming a performer to reckon with in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) market, thanks to its innovative crypto lending products. The presale has already accumulated over $7.2 million, with more than 9,100 investors having already participated. Currently priced at $0.025, MUTM tokens will transition to $0.03 in the next presale phase, and early investors stand to earn up to 140% profit when the token hits its estimated launch price of $0.06. The platform’s advanced lending system is disrupting decentralized markets, and it is positioning the platform as one of the leading DeFi projects. The results of the Certik smart contract audit will be released soon, offering additional transparency and assurance to investors. Rewarding Early Investors & Building the Mutuum Finance Community Mutuum Finance offers attractive rewards for early adopters in an attempt to build a strong, active community. Under the program, the platform is conducting a $100,000 giveaway contest, in which ten participants are awarded $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Additionally, the referral program encourages users to invite others to the ecosystem, promoting organic growth. Early adopters gain exclusive access to staking, voting rights, and priority platform updates, making them significantly invested in the project’s development. To additionally promote price stability, Mutuum Finance operates in a stablecoin environment, where users are allowed to deposit USD funds. This approach eliminates the traditional instability issues of the old financial systems, while establishing a safer and more stable transactional environment. Mutuum Finance’s utilization of modern lending innovations is ushering in lasting changes in the DeFi ecosystem. The Dual-Model Crypto Lending System One of the features of Mutuum Finance is the double-lending model of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending frameworks. In the P2C framework, it leverages the smart contract pools to offer stablecoin lending with the option for users to earn passive income during lending. In contrast, the P2P framework removes intermediates, offering direct interaction between borrowers and lenders, giving both parties greater freedom. Auto-adjusting interest rates also make the platform more efficient, with better balance between returns for lenders and borrowing costs for users. While Ripple (XRP) offers a solid 5x return potential over the next 100 days, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a far more explosive upside. With over $7.2 million raised from 9,100+ investors and presale tokens still available at $0.025, the opportunity to secure a possible 50x return before launch is quickly vanishing. Don’t settle for steady when you can go exponential. Join the presale now and position yourself at the forefront of DeFi’s next breakout star.

That’s exactly what’s happening now with Bitcoin , XRP , Ethereum , and the fast-rising MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . As larger players reinforce their foundations, emerging names like MAGACOINFINANCE are grabbing attention for offering something even more valuable: early entry with major upside potential still ahead. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quietly Building Toward Its Breakout Moment It’s the quiet momentum phases that often produce the biggest breakouts. MAGACOINFINANCE is in that phase right now—building wallet adoption, expanding its community organically, and delivering consistently against its roadmap. The early signs are undeniable: real traction without artificial hype. Growth that’s based on adoption, not flash marketing. Strategic moves that align with the best early-stage success stories in crypto history. This isn’t a project designed to spike and fade. MAGACOINFINANCE is positioning for endurance—and those moving now are positioning ahead of the inevitable next wave. The Pillars: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Are Strengthening Foundations Bitcoin continues to act as the ultimate store of value in the crypto ecosystem. Its increasing acceptance among institutional investors and traditional finance giants makes its foundation stronger than ever. Every dip, every correction, has only strengthened Bitcoin’s long-term narrative. Ethereum remains the lifeblood of smart contract development. With Layer-2 solutions expanding and new upgrades optimizing scalability and security, Ethereum’s long-term dominance looks all but certain. XRP is leveraging regulatory victories and growing partnerships with major financial players. As global payment systems continue to evolve, XRP’s technology is positioned to capture significant transaction volume across borders. These names will always be relevant—but early-stage asymmetric opportunities like MAGACOINFINANCE are where aggressive growth potential still thrives. Strengthening Forces: Optimism, Aptos, and Chainlink Optimism has solidified its role as a critical scaling solution for Ethereum, driving faster, cheaper transactions for a new wave of decentralized applications. Aptos continues to show strength among newer Layer-1 platforms, appealing to developers looking for security, speed, and user-focused blockchain architecture. Chainlink remains the dominant force in blockchain oracles. With real-world integrations expanding rapidly, its importance to decentralized applications across sectors keeps growing. While these platforms are building steadily, MAGACOINFINANCE remains the one with pure early-stage discovery momentum—and that’s where true breakout opportunities often live. Final Word Is a $1.3 million path truly unfolding? Crypto history has shown that the combination of consolidation among giants and early-stage momentum among newcomers can lead to life-changing results. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP are reinforcing their dominance. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is carving out a fresh lane—and those paying attention today could be the ones holding tomorrow’s headlines.

Interestingly, the latest on-chain data suggests that the price of BTC could fly past this level and forge a new all-time high over the coming weeks. What Will Happen If Bitcoin Price Falls Beneath $93,145? In an April 26 post on X, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an exciting analysis and projection for the Bitcoin price over the next few weeks. According to the online pundit, the flagship cryptocurrency could be on its way to as high as $131,800 so long as it stays above a critical support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Highest Exchange Outflows In 2 Years, What This Means For Price This projection is based on the Short-Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis, which measures the average price at which recent investors — typically defined as wallets holding Bitcoin for less than 155 days — acquired their coins. This metric often offers insight into the sentiment of short-term investors and can act as a relevant psychological support or resistance level. When the Bitcoin price is above the STH Cost Basis, it typically signals bullish momentum among short-term market participants. On the other hand, a sustained break beneath this metric could trigger increased selling pressure, as short-term holders are known for their speculative and reactive nature. According to data from Glassnode, the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis currently stands around $93,145, which represents a crucial support level for the Bitcoin price. Martinez noted that the premier cryptocurrency needs to hold above this support to make a run to a new all-time high price of $131,800. However, Martinez warned that if the Bitcoin price fails to defend the $93,145 support cushion, this could open the door to a broader correction. In this case, the market leader may suffer a deep price pullback toward the next major support level around $71,150 — an almost 25% decline from the current price point. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands around $94,410, reflecting a 0.6% decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is up by more than 10% on the weekly timeframe. Could BTC Whales Provide The Needed Bullish Impetus? In a separate post on X, Martinez revealed that the Bitcoin whales have been getting busy in the market, loading up their bags following the recent price rally. Whales are significant market participants due to their substantial holdings and also their often informed trading decisions and positions.

Strongly believe Bitcoin will reach $180k to $200k in 2025.” Five days later, BTC was trading above $93,600. BITCOIN is $84k today. Strongly believe Bitcoin will reach $180k to $200k in 2025. What do you think? — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 20, 2025 Earlier, on Apr. 18, the “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” author predicted that Bitcoin’s price will eventually skyrocket to $1 million. His related price predictions spelled doom for the dollar’s buying power: “I strongly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will be over $ 1 million dollars. Gold will be $30k and silver $3,000 a coin.” “People who heeded my warnings are doing well today. I am concerned for those who did not,” wrote Kiyosaki in the long-form X update. He warned, “This coming Great Depression will cause millions to be poor… and a few who take action may enjoy great wealth and freedom.” Dire Economic Straits and Enterprising Bitcoin Investors Kiyosaki isn’t a contrarian voice to warn of a difficult economic downturn ahead. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned in April that the US could soon be mired in a stagflationary period of low growth and rising prices. Kiyosaki is also not the only financial expert who has predicted that Bitcoin’s price will reach $1 million. In fact, his timeframe for it is conservative compared to Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s, who predicted a $1 million BTC price by 2030 in May last year . But, Kiyosaki is firmly in the high-conviction column for Bitcoin’s potential upside prices five and ten years from now. Here’s how some of his classic investment advice applies to BTC. 1. Kiyosaki on Income vs. Wealth “The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements.” In his New York Times bestseller on personal finances and building wealth, Kiyosaki makes an important distinction between wealth and income. He points out that income takes most of your time and effort to sustain, but that wealth sustains your income automatically. This means even high-income individuals can struggle under equally big spending routines and borrow money at substantial interest rates to maintain a certain way of living. Thus, not long ago, PYMNTS and the Lending Club found in a survey that about 50% of Americans with six-figure incomes may be living paycheck to paycheck. In April, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said that late credit card payments and minimum payments are at the highest level since 2012. Individuals and households with these spending routines are swimming in the opposite direction of the macro financial currents of the past ten years, as the voracious Bitcoin hoarders . Managing finances this way is bargaining a harder tomorrow for an easier today. But the way frugal and thrifty saver/investors budget is bargaining a harder today for an easier tomorrow. 2. ‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad’ on Investing “You must know the difference between an asset and a liability and buy assets. An asset puts money in your pocket. A liability takes money out of your pocket.” Kiyosaki also discerns between assets and liabilities in an individual or household’s financial balance book. In his opinion, houses should not be considered assets because they cost money to maintain and finance. During the US housing market boom that preceded the 2008 financial crisis and the great recession, conventional financial wisdom said to buy a house because its value would continue going up forever. But starting in 2007, a mass wave of defaults and foreclosures crashed house prices. Bitcoin launched soon after that to create a space in the financial ecosystem based on settlement instead of lending. Instead of paying future obligations to consume more today, as with housing loans, Bitcoin is like collecting future rewards by consuming more efficiently today and buying BTC with the savings. If it continues to appreciate in value due to its scarcity and global popular demand, it will remain an asset rather than a liability like a mortgage, credit card balance, or college loan. 3. Bitcoin and Financial Literacy “Illiteracy, both in words and numbers, is the foundation of financial struggle.” Another key point of Kiyosaki’s message in “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” was that families, schools, and the government have mostly failed to educate Americans about the basics of finance and investing. He says that many people don’t really understand the disadvantages of borrowing money and paying interest instead of saving money and collecting returns on investments. That kind of bad financial math doesn’t just keep many Americans out of investing in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. It keeps them from saving any money using any method. Last December, a Schroders US retirement survey found that half of Gen Xers, Americans aged 44 to 59, have not done any retirement planning at all. In the cryptocurrency social media community, users like to post, “Do your own research.” Bitcoin aficionados especially like to post, “Do the math.” One benefit of learning about investing and doing financial math is that it can help to counteract the often more convincing pull of immediate gratification and result in healthier financial behavior. 4. Household Finance, Consumer Debt, and Bitcoin “A person can be highly educated, professionally successful, and financially illiterate. Many financial problems are caused by trying to keep up with the Joneses.” In fact, the main thrust of Kiyosaki’s book is that he found it remarkable in the course of his life’s experiences, how blatantly neglected financial and investment thinking is among even people of high intelligence, career success, and social status. The basics of accounting, budgeting, investing, and tax law are not learned or practiced by a shocking swath of the populace, he contends, despite the importance of these modalities to beneficial outcomes that people desire. If most people cannot be bothered to devote two to three hours a week to learning and eventually mastering these reliably rewarding and basic areas of competency, then it’s no mystery why Bitcoin remains inaccessible to many because it sits well enough beyond their threshold for healthy curiosity.

This cryptocurrency-tied derivative product will be launched on May 19 after necessary regulatory approvals. It’s also worth noting that CME successfully launched Solana futures last month. Ever since the appointment of Donald Trump as the president, there has been an increase in derivative offerings tied to cryptocurrencies. Keep reading to learn more about the growing trend of crypto trading products and which is the best crypto to buy now to make the most of this unique opportunity. The Trend of Crypto Products CME has seen tremendous growth in derivative trading during the first quarter of 2025. The company reported an average daily volume of 198K crypto contracts with a notional value of around $11.3B. A large part of this volume consisted of micro Ether features and micro Bitcoin futures. CME now wants to double down on this demand through its new XRP derivative product. XRP has also shown stability during the past two months. Although it tested its support at $1.73 during the first week of April, it did not breach it. Since then, it has shown a steady increase of 33% and is currently trading at $2.168 . Increasing Confidence in Bitcoin Bitcoin has also started showing signs of strength since last week. For the first time in seven weeks, it breached the $95K level and has been able to hold it since. $BTC is now trading around $94K , preparing to reclaim its high. The king crypto is showing a picture-perfect bounce from the 50% Fibonacci level , which is also a major support zone. What’s more, the price is now above the 50, 20, and 10 EMAs, showing massive bullish momentum. Plus, there’s a huge pile of crypto-pegged ETF applications pending with the SEC. Ever since the first Bitcoin ETF was approved in January 2025, the SEC has seen applications for Solana ETFs, Litecoin ETFs, XRP ETFs, and more. Trump also announced the formation of a US Bitcoin reserve, which triggered a global race among countries to hoard the asset. These macro- and microeconomic factors are surely a big positive for the crypto market as a whole. A favorable administration will ease out the regulations around crypto and help it become mainstream in the next few years. All this means that this is the right time to invest in crypto. To help you get started, here are three of the best altcoins right now. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto to Buy In 2025 BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is probably the best crypto to invest in if you want to maximize your earnings from the upcoming Bitcoin (and crypto) bull run. That’s because it’s the ONLY crypto to offer free (and real) $BTC airdrops to its token holders. The airdrops will take place every time Bitcoin reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. So, if you believe in Bitcoin’s lofty price predictions, you’d want to hold onto your $BTCBULL tokens – and remember to store them in Best Wallet to be eligible for free $BTC. We read through BTC Bull Token’s whitepaper and found that the developers have decided upon a deflationary approach, which, too, is based on Bitcoin’s price. Every time $BTC rises by $25K (so $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on), a part of the total supply of $BTCBULL tokens will be wiped off. Because there will be fewer tokens in circulation, especially if Bitcoin climbs quickly, it will crank up $BTCBULL’s demand and, therefore, its price. The best part is that you can grab this one-of-a-kind Bitcoin-themed altcoin for just $0.00248. That’s because the project is in presale, where it has so far raised over $5M. Here’s how to buy $BTCBULL . 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Top New Altcoin Revolutionizing the Solana Blockchain Solaxy ($SOLX) is right at the heart of Solana’s potentially bright future. After all, this new cryptocurrency is going to build the first-ever Layer 2 scaling solution on the network. Albeit successful, the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA earlier this year overloaded Solana. As a result, the blockchain has been struggling to process transactions in a timely fashion. There’s congestion on the network and, of course, scalability issues. However, with Solaxy being a multi-chain token, it will blend Solana’s high speed and low fees with Ethereum’s vast liquidity pool. Solaxy’s main plan of action, though, is offloading a bunch of transactions from Solana’s mainnet onto a sidechain to reduce the burden on the network as a whole. Furthermore, Solaxy will also process its share of the transactions in batches – rather than one by one. This will further improve Solana’s affordability. With nearly $32M in early investor funding, Solaxy is easily the best crypto presale on the market right now. Join the bandwagon for just $0.001706 per token. For more help, check out our guide on how to buy Solaxy . 3. OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) – One of the Hottest Cryptos Right Now OFFICIAL TRUMP ($TRUMP) is back among the top trending cryptos thanks to a mind-blowing announcement last week. It said that the top 220 $TRUMP holders will be invited to dinner with none other than Donald Trump himself. $TRUMP is up over 80% in the last seven days . Its newfound momentum could easily see it break the next major resistance zone of around $23-$24. If that happens, it would result in a gain of over 160% from its current price of $14.77. It’s worth noting that with nearly $3B in market capitalization, $TRUMP is not just the best PolitiFi crypto going around, but it’s also the fourth biggest meme coin. It’s behind only $DOGE, $SHIB, and $PEPE. Even the Best Crypto to Buy Now Rely on the Market’s Favor The crypto market’s expansion, thanks to friendly regulations and new trading products, is certainly positive news if you’re an investor. However, bear in mind that this market is highly volatile, meaning it can switch trends quicker than you realize. Therefore, we recommend only investing an amount that’s small enough for you.

The incident occurred on April 26 , when a hacker drained 5.7 million USDC and 1,200 SOL by executing a series of undercollateralized loans, according to Loopscale co-founder Mary Gooneratne. In response, Loopscale has partially restored platform functions, allowing users to repay loans, add collateral, and close existing loops. However, key features, including vault withdrawals, remain disabled as the team continues its investigation. Loopscale Exploit Hits USDC and SOL Vaults Gooneratne confirmed that the exploit was limited to the protocol’s USDC and SOL vaults, representing about 12% of Loopscale’s total value locked (TVL). “Our team is fully mobilized to investigate, recover funds, and ensure users are protected,” Gooneratne stated on X. Update: Loopscale has re-enabled loan repayments, top-ups, and loop closing. All other app functions (including Vault withdrawals) are still temporarily restricted while we investigate and ensure mitigation of this exploit. The root cause of the exploit has been identified as an… https://t.co/Pk2pMx8UcK — Loopscale (@LoopscaleLabs) April 26, 2025 The attack adds to a growing list of crypto exploits in 2025. Blockchain security firm PeckShield recently reported over $1.6 billion in crypto thefts during Q1 alone, with the majority linked to a $1.5 billion hack on centralized exchange ByBit by North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Launched publicly on April 10 after a six-month beta, Loopscale introduced a unique DeFi lending model aimed at improving capital efficiency. Unlike protocols such as Aave, which rely on pooled liquidity, Loopscale uses an order book system to directly match lenders and borrowers. It also offers specialized markets for structured credit, receivables financing, and undercollateralized loans. Before the exploit, Loopscale managed around $40 million in TVL and had attracted over 7,000 lenders. Its USDC and SOL vaults were offering attractive yields of over 5% and 10% APR, respectively. The platform also supported lending for tokens like JitoSOL and BONK, along with looping strategies across 40 token pairs. Investigations into the breach remain ongoing. Crypto Lost $1.6 Billion to Hacks in Q1 In the first three months of 2025, the crypto ecosystem lost a whopping $1,635,933,800 across 39 incidents, according to the blockchain security platform Immunefi . The report claimed, “Q1 2025 marks the worst quarter for hacks in the history of the crypto ecosystem.” Most of that was the result of only two hacks of two centralized exchanges. Phemex suffered a $69.1 million loss in January, while Bybit lost $1.46 billion in February. Subsequently, the total number of losses in the first quarter marks a 4.7x increase compared to Q1 2024 . At that time, hackers and fraudsters stole $348,251,217. Notably, experts assume that the infamous North Korean Lazarus Group is behind the two largest attacks. They stole $1.52 billion, which is 94% of total losses.

With the leading cryptocurrency pausing, attention shifts to Stacks and SUI . The article explores whether these emerging coins have the potential to rise independently in the current market landscape. Stacks Market Snapshot: Rally Amid Long-Term Volatility Stacks recorded a significant weekly jump of 47.01% and a 24.19% rise over the last month, while the six-month performance fell by 48.81%. The recent price surge contrasts sharply with the long-term decline, indicating changes in market sentiment and a recovery from previous lows. Current prices range from $0.47 to $0.82, with immediate support at $0.33 and resistance at $1.03; a secondary resistance sits at $1.38. Bulls have propelled prices up, yet an RSI of 72.20 suggests potential overbought conditions. Trading within these levels may present opportunities for short-term gains while remaining aware of the ongoing long-term pressures. SUI Price Surge: Past Gains and Current Levels SUI recorded a 30.06% increase over the past month and a remarkable 104.31% jump in the last six months. Price movements have shown both rapid weekly gains of 68.25% and overall volatility that underscores shifting investor sentiment. The coin has undergone significant growth while experiencing intermittent pullbacks, indicating an environment full of potential opportunities and challenges. SUI trades between $1.74 and $3.03, with immediate resistance at $3.78 and a second hurdle at $5.07, while support is established around $1.21. Technical indicators, including a high RSI of 77.95, suggest short-term bullish momentum but show signs of overextension. A careful approach focused on buying near support and selling around resistance may prove effective. Conclusion As Bitcoin's rally halts at $95k, attention shifts to Stacks (STX) and SUI . Both have shown resilience and potential for independent growth. STX's unique approach to integrating with existing networks offers a new way forward. SUI's features appeal to users seeking innovative solutions. The question remains whether these two can maintain their momentum.

Today, while Bitcoin (BTC) , Solana (SOL) , and XRP continue leading the charge, smart investors are quietly scouting projects that are still under the radar. One name now rising quickly into these conversations is MAGACOINFINANCE.COM —an early-stage token already showing the structural signs needed to thrive in 2025. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Building Quiet Strength Ahead of the Next Big Wave Real wealth in crypto is made before the market catches on—and right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is entering that exact phase. The project is scaling steadily with authentic wallet growth, real community traction, and disciplined early positioning—not empty promises. Based on the early momentum and expanding exposure, MAGACOINFINANCE is now being forecasted by analysts tracking as stealth-phase altcoins—placing it firmly in rare company ahead of broader listings. Other Key Contenders: XRP, ADA, TRX, and LTC XRP remains a leading payments-focused asset, showing resilience across market shifts. Cardano (ADA) continues pushing for sustainable, decentralized innovation through peer-reviewed research. TRON (TRX) drives efficient decentralized applications, especially in emerging markets. Litecoin (LTC) holds strong as a lightweight, battle-tested payment solution. These assets maintain strength—but none of them are still offering the undiscovered early-mover advantage that MAGACOINFINANCE provides right now. Final Word The next major crypto cycle won’t just reward holding established names—it will reward those who move early on the next big opportunities. With Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana continuing to thrive—and MAGACOINFINANCE rapidly gaining strategic momentum—this could be the rare window where smart positioning transforms small bets into massive returns.

Krueger summarized his observations using the Quantile Model, which shows that Bitcoin is likely to reach the 95% quantile region. If this milestone is reached in 2025, he expects Bitcoin to reach around $250,000. If the cycle extends to 2026, he believes the price could climb to $300,000. Krueger predicts a significant pullback after the peak, predicting that Bitcoin could drop into the “Yellow zone” around $150,000. He claimed that the optimal point for users to start reducing their positions would be $200,000. On the other hand, Bitcoin is traded at $94,000, according to data from Binance TR. Related News: Will History Repeat Itself in Bitcoin (BTC)? Expert Analysts Give Their Predictions In his analysis, Krueger argued against applying Metcalfe’s Law, which ties network value to the square of the number of users, to Bitcoin. Instead, he argued that Bitcoin’s growth was not due to traditional network effects seen on platforms like Facebook or blockchains like Solana, but rather to growing belief among investors. He likened Bitcoin’s behavior to gold, stating that Bitcoin is a monetary good, a digital store of value, and a hedge against fiat currency depreciation. In response to a follower who claimed that Bitcoin could fall to $80,000 by 2026, Krueger acknowledged the possibility, pointing to broader macroeconomic and political implications, adding that it could happen as soon as 2027, even if Trump “loses the midterm elections.” *This is not investment advice.

However, this might change soon. Well-known crypto expert Dr. Altcoin predicts that Pi Coin’s rally could begin during the highly anticipated Consensus Summit starting from 14 May 2025. Pi Price Rally To Come At Consensus Summit In his latest X post, Dr Altcoin said he feels pretty confident that the Pi price pump could actually begin during the highly anticipated Consensus Summit, which is happening from May 14 to May 16, 2025 . This global blockchain event brings together the biggest names in crypto, offering Pi a perfect stage to shine. He believes that even small positive news like new partnerships, major updates, or ecosystem growth announced during this event could create a rush of excitement. Thus, if Pi Network gets the right attention, it could lead to a major price rally even before August. Pi Unlocking to Easy After August Although, this comes as a surprise for many because earlier expectations were tied to the end of August, a time when a large amount of Pi coins would finish unlocking, creating less selling pressure. According to the Piscan , the beginning of August will see the release of Pi tokens drop by almost half. In August, only $132.5 million worth of Pi tokens will be released. September will see $115.2 million, October $89.5 million, and November $85.9 million. Pi Coin Price Outlook As of now, Pi Network coin is trading at $0.63, reflecting a drop of 1.3% seen in the last 24 hours. The coin has been consolidating recently, trading between resistance at $0.68 and support at $0.61. If the price breaks above $0.68, it could mark the beginning of a fresh rally. The next resistance levels to watch would be $0.789 and $0.85. If the upward momentum continues, Pi Coin could aim for $1.03, its first time above $1 since last month.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-27 12:13:35

Binance Coin ( BNB ) traded at the psychological level of $600 on Sunday, slightly below this month’s high of $630 and 15% above its lowest point this month. The main catalyst for the BNB price will be the Lorentz upgrade, which will happen on April 29. This is one of the three upgrades of the year. Its goal will be to make BSC one of the fastest chains in the crypto industry. The Lorentz upgrade will reduce the block time from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds. The goal is to cut latency and accelerate transaction confirmations. Faster speeds will also enhance the responsiveness of decentralized applications on the network. You might also like: Ethereum price eyes $2,000 as spot ETH ETFs buck worrying trend The BSC developers will continue building after the Lorentz upgrade as they seek to launch the Maxwell upgrade in June. Like Lorentz, Maxwell hopes to supercharge the network’s transaction speed by reducing block times to 0.75 seconds. BSC builders hope to catch up with Solana ( SOL ) over time. Due to its combination of proof-of-stake and proof-of-history, Solana now has block times of approximately 0.4 seconds. Ethereum ( ETH ), on the other hand, has block times of 12 seconds, making it a slower chain than its biggest competitors. The Lorentz upgrade comes after the developers launched the Pascal hard fork, which increased Ethereum’s integration, introduced gasless transactions, and enhanced security. BSC developers hope the network will be the most viable alternative to Solana and Ethereum. Solana has become the home of meme coins, while Ethereum is known for its slow speeds and high transaction costs. BNB price technical analysis BNB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the BNB price formed a triple-bottom pattern between $507 and $520. These levels formed the lower side of the descending triangle pattern, a popular bearish continuation sign. The coin now sits on the upper side of the triangle pattern and is consolidating at the 100-day and 50-day moving averages. Therefore, the outlook is neutral for now. More gains will be confirmed if the coin rises above $620, the highest point this month. This move will see it jump to the next resistance at $720, its highest level in June last year. The alternative scenario is for the Binance Coin price to drop and retest the lower side of the descending triangle pattern at $507.

The big question now is whether it will reach the $4,000 mark before the year ends. At the same time, attention turns to Solana to see if it will follow Ethereum's upward momentum. This article explores the potential for these coins to grow. Ethereum: Mixed Signals Amid Short-Term Gains and Long-Term Declines Last month ETH performance showed a drop of about 10%, while the last six months recorded a decline nearing 30%. A sudden one-week uplift of nearly 12% hints at a recent burst of buying interest despite the longer downturn. Overall, the trend remains weighed down by extended bearish pressure over the past half-year. Current trading levels span from roughly $1539 to $2326. The nearest support sits at $1256 and resistance at about $2829, with additional levels at $468 and $3616 also in view. The indicators give mixed signals with a slight bearish bias amid the recent surge, leaving room for cautious trading within these bounds. SOL Price Trends: Short-Term Gains Amid Longer-Term Dips SOL experienced a 6.58% gain over the past month but faced a 17.20% decline over the last six months. The coin shows signs of short-term recovery with a 5.54% weekly increase, suggesting renewed trading interest after a prolonged drop. Price action over these periods reflects a mix of recovery and caution that has defined recent market behavior. Currently, SOL trades within a range of $97.94 to $165.67, with nearby support at $71.30 and resistance at $206.76. Positive momentum indicators such as an RSI of 60.23, an Awesome Oscillator of 20.07, and a momentum of 12.77 indicate bullish pressure. Traders may consider buying near support and watching for exits toward resistance, as the trend remains uncertain. Conclusion ETH has shown strong recovery potential, potentially reaching $4,000 this year. SOL might follow ETH's bullish trend, hinting at growth opportunities. Both coins demonstrate resilience and upward momentum in the market. The coming months will be crucial for tracking their performance.

Crypto traders have been closely watching the asset’s tight trading range as it consolidates between the $0.617 support level and the critical $0.68 resistance level. Most analysts agree that if Pi Network (PI) can decisively break above this resistance level, it could trigger a strong rally. However, savvy crypto traders are not waiting; they are liquidating their assets and buying a rising altcoin that continues to steal the spotlight in the market. Pi Network (PI) Aims To Defy Market Odds And Rally Higher After experiencing notable declines over the past month, Pi Network (PI) is now trading around $0.6477, attempting to stabilize following a 22.71% drop over the last 30 days. Although Pi Network’s (PI) daily movements have been underwhelming, with only a 0.09% gain over the past week, technical analysts are zeroing in on a key level that could determine its next major rally. Analyzing the possibility of this rally, prominent crypto analyst Jatin Gupta on X (formerly Twitter) flagged Pi Network’s (PI) proximity to the 200-day MA, warning of “big movements” ahead. He advised crypto traders to watch this zone closely, as a rejection could deepen the downtrend, while a breakout could re-energize bullish momentum and drive a rally. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Rising Altcoin Gaining Traction Among Crypto Traders While Pi Network’s (PI) next move remains in question, many crypto traders are positioning themselves ahead of the curve, scouting for rising opportunities that offer stronger growth potential, and FloppyPepe (FPPE) is standing out. This altcoin, through its ongoing presale, is poised for a massive rally that could multiply its value by ten times. Matt Furie’s FloppyPepe (FPPE), combining meme culture with next-generation AI technology , is quickly gaining traction among crypto traders worldwide. A Unique Ecosystem Powered By AI Powering the FloppyPepe (FPPE) ecosystem are two cutting-edge AI-driven platforms: Meme-o-Matic , a generative meme creation engine that democratizes digital content, and FloppyX , an advanced video generation bot that translates complex narratives into visually compelling experiences. In terms of tokenomics and long-term value prospects, FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) is engineered to increase scarcity and reward holders naturally.

Another 1% is dedicated to wildlife conservation, giving the project cultural depth beyond price action. Combined with zero transaction taxes and a fully audited smart contract by SolidProof, this project creates a frictionless, deflationary ecosystem built for sustained demand and exponential growth. Community-Driven Growth And Increasing Attention FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) growth trajectory is supported by its active and expanding community. Influential crypto voices, such as David In Crypto and Crypto Legends, have recognised the project’s promising prospects, which position the altcoin for mass adoption and a significant rally once it reaches exchanges. As FloppyPepe (FPPE) advances through its presale, its growth plan focuses on deploying AI tools, securing strategic Tier-1 exchange listings, and aggressively expanding its community. This multi-phase roadmap, which blends cultural relevance, real-world impact, and cutting-edge technology, positions the altcoin for sustained momentum far beyond its presale stage. Pi Network (PI) on the Edge, FloppyPepe (FPPE) Already Gaining Speed ​​ As Pi Network (PI) hovers near a critical technical level that could determine its next meteoric rally, altcoin traders are already widening their focus to projects offering stronger growth opportunities. Among these, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out as a clear frontrunner, combining humor, AI-driven tools, sustainable tokenomics, and tangible social impact into a single compelling package. With FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) private sale selling out rapidly, it’s clear the presale tokens will be completely snapped up at the time. For crypto traders seeking exposure to the next major altcoin success story, this altcoin’s low entry price of $0.0000002 presents a bold and transformative opportunity — one that is already gaining momentum as the broader market watches.

Right now, four names are flashing early signals for those looking to get ahead: XRP , Solana , Bitcoin , and the rapidly emerging MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . As traditional assets consolidate strength, newer projects are pushing forward—and MAGACOINFINANCE is beginning to look like one of the most promising entries into the next growth phase. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Preparing for a Major Lift-Off It’s rare to catch projects before they move—but right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is giving investors that rare window. Wallet activity is climbing. Community engagement is scaling steadily. Developer updates are rolling out on schedule. And serious early-stage investors are quietly positioning—without the fanfare, before the headlines catch up. This project isn’t racing for hype—it’s building momentum the right way: sustainably, strategically, and visibly. If you’re looking for something that still has real upside potential without the inflated early valuations, MAGACOINFINANCE may be one of the last true plays this cycle. Other Movers in the Spotlight: Cardano, NEAR Protocol, Kaspa, and Arbitrum Cardano remains a top choice for those who value peer-reviewed blockchain research and secure, sustainable smart contract deployment. NEAR Protocol is making significant strides with its easy onboarding experience and fast-growing developer ecosystem focused on decentralized apps. Kaspa continues to gain a following among those who prefer high-speed, proof-of-work blockchains. Its blockDAG structure is drawing attention from performance-driven projects. Arbitrum leads the pack among Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, delivering scalable dApps with reduced gas fees and lightning-fast transaction speeds. All these projects are building—but when it comes to pure early-stage upside, MAGACOINFINANCE stands out as the one to watch. Final Word Can $650 really become $800K? In crypto, history says it’s not just possible—it’s happened repeatedly for those who caught the right project early. XRP , Solana , and Bitcoin offer strength.

The incident occurred on April 26, when a hacker siphoned around 5.7 million USDC and 1,200 SOL by taking out a series of undercollateralized loans, according to Loopscale co-founder Mary Gooneratne. Following the breach, Loopscale announced on X that it had re-enabled loan repayments, top-ups, and loop closing functionalities. However, all other app features, including vault withdrawals, remain temporarily restricted as the team continues to investigate the attack and work on mitigation measures. Gooneratne emphasized that the exploit only affected Loopscale’s USDC and SOL vaults and that the losses represent roughly 12% of the platform’s total value locked (TVL). “Our team is fully mobilized to investigate, recover funds, and ensure users are protected,” Gooneratne said in her post. About Loopscale Prior to the exploit, Loopscale’s main USDC and SOL vaults were offering annual percentage rates (APRs) exceeding 5% and 10%, respectively. The platform also supports lending markets for a range of tokens, including JitoSOL and BONK, along with looping strategies for more than 40 different token pairs. According to blockchain researcher OurNetwork, Loopscale had attracted over 7,000 lenders and accumulated around $40 million in TVL before the breach. The team’s response to the incident and the steps they take toward recovery and security enhancements will likely play a crucial role in restoring community trust moving forward. Crypto Hacks in 2025 The hack adds to a growing list of crypto exploits in 2025 . Blockchain security firm PeckShield reported earlier this month that hackers stole more than $1.6 billion worth of digital assets during the first quarter alone. Notably, over 90% of that figure is attributed to a $1.5 billion attack on centralized exchange ByBit , allegedly carried out by North Korean cybercrime group Lazarus. Loopscale had only recently launched on April 10 following a six-month closed beta. The DeFi platform offers a unique approach to lending by directly matching lenders with borrowers, rather than using traditional liquidity pools as seen with competitors like Aave. This order book model supports a variety of specialized lending markets, including structured credit, receivables financing, and undercollateralized loans.

Hedera and Tezos are two names that’ve been bouncing around lately—with updates that sparked fresh conversations across Twitter threads, Reddit debates, and Discord calls. But while they’re pushing through interesting upgrades, one project quietly grinding through presale stages is pulling massive traction without the same mainstream noise. Yep, it’s time to talk about what’s going on before the next breakout—not after. That’s where Qubetics ($TICS) comes into the convo. Unlike the usual hype tokens, Qubetics is building tech that directly hits real-world pain points in crypto and digital finance. It isn’t just talking about decentralization—it’s shipping a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet with actual features that both everyday people and serious businesses can use. And while the headlines are caught up with post-launch coins, Qubetics is still running one of the best crypto presale events right now—offering stage-based pricing with massive ROI projections that haven’t been realized yet. So if you’re searching for the best cryptos to invest in this weekend, it’s time to zoom in on the one project that’s still within reach. Qubetics Wallet in Action — A Web3 Application That Actually Solves Problems Qubetics isn’t just building another digital wallet—it’s creating a toolkit that blends traditional finance flexibility with the decentralization crypto was supposed to deliver. At the core of this ecosystem is its non-custodial, multi-chain wallet that lets users manage, spend, and convert their $TICS tokens across multiple platforms without gatekeeping middlemen. This wallet isn’t locked to one blockchain either—it’s a full Web3 aggregator that connects with top networks like Ethereum, BNB, and Solana, giving users cross-chain access in one place. The real kicker is what this means in daily life. A freelance designer in Austin can store her project payments in $TICS, convert them instantly to stablecoins for USD-equivalent purchases, and swipe her debit card through Apple Pay or Google Pay at a café—no friction. Meanwhile, a logistics company in Ohio can pay its global vendors in crypto through Qubetics’ virtual card functionality, while staying secure and traceable. Qubetics Wallet supports both physical and virtual cards, giving users flexibility and control over how they spend and secure their funds. What really stands out is the smooth conversion mechanism. It auto-swaps crypto to stablecoins like USDT or USDC right at checkout, so merchants receive a stable value without worrying about price dips. This feature makes it way more usable for stores and online services, solving one of the biggest barriers in crypto adoption. Whether it’s a gamer topping up credits, or a business running payroll in tokens, Qubetics is pushing real Web3 use—not just flexing jargon. And that’s why it deserves a spot on any list of the best cryptos to invest in this weekend . Qubetics Presale Explained — A Hidden Gem Among the Best Cryptos to Invest in This Weekend Right now, Qubetics is deep in its 31st presale stage, with the current price at just $0.1902. It’s already pulled in over $16.4 million, with more than 25,200 token holders and 509 million $TICS sold so far. Each stage only lasts 7 days and ends every Sunday at 12 AM, followed by a 10% price increase. This structure rewards early adopters in a real, trackable way. And with the Qubetics mainnet launch set for Q2 2025, the window is still wide open—but not for long. Here’s where things get spicy. If someone grabs $TICS at the current price and holds until it hits $1 post-presale, they’re looking at a 425.53% ROI. That multiplies fast—at $5 it turns into 2,527.67%, at $6 it’s 3,053.21%, and at $10 it rockets to 5,155.35%. And yes, if it ever hits $15, we’re talking a 7,783.02% ROI. Let’s say a participant throws in $200 today. At the current rate of $0.1902, that nets 1,051.58 $TICS. If $TICS reaches just $10, that $200 turns into $10,515.80. That’s not just potential—it’s the kind of math that turns casual followers into early believers. And with the Qubetics presale still live, this is arguably the best crypto presale opportunity available this weekend. While everyone’s caught up chasing already-launched tokens, the real win might still be in the early stages. This is why Qubetics stands out in the race for the best cryptos to invest in this weekend. Hedera’s Hashgraph Upgrade Is Shaking Up dApp Scalability Hedera’s been busy lately, especially with its advancements in the enterprise layer and the continued adoption of its Hashgraph consensus. Unlike traditional blockchains, Hedera’s tech operates on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) model, which offers faster transaction speeds and finality without the typical trade-offs in scalability. This has been a game-changer for high-frequency apps, and recent developer updates have started making some serious waves. One of the standout updates is the integration of account abstraction, which simplifies how smart contracts interact with user wallets. This gives dApp developers more flexibility to build mainstream-friendly apps that don’t require users to understand seed phrases, gas fees, or even crypto itself. Projects in DeFi, healthcare data, and even supply chain logistics are actively testing Hedera’s unique setup to streamline back-end processes. Another notable point? The Hedera Governing Council keeps expanding—new members are joining from massive global brands, bringing credibility and potential long-term partnerships to the table. This council structure has always set Hedera apart from fully decentralized governance, offering more predictability and trust in how the ecosystem grows. While some in the crypto space push back on this centralized model, many businesses prefer the stability and predictability that comes with it. And with the current uptick in partnerships and on-chain activity, Hedera’s positioning itself not just as a fast blockchain—but as one that’s truly enterprise-grade. For anyone looking to get involved in tokens backed by real tech use cases, Hedera’s definitely a contender this weekend. Tezos Brings Adaptive Innovation to Smart Contracts Tezos continues to stay relevant by doing what many chains don’t: evolving without forks. Thanks to its on-chain governance model, the network can upgrade itself without forcing the community to split. And its latest protocol upgrade, which focused on scaling and reducing smart contract fees, proves it’s still committed to the dev crowd that made it popular in the first place. One thing that’s helped Tezos stay strong is its backing from real-world partnerships—especially in art, fashion, and digital collectibles. The ecosystem has been adopted by big names like Ubisoft and Red Bull Racing for NFT integrations and sponsorships. These partnerships show that Tezos isn’t just building tech in a vacuum—it’s putting it in the hands of recognizable global brands. From a tech angle, the new upgrade is aiming to push up throughput through rollups while maintaining the network’s unique approach to energy efficiency. Tezos remains one of the most eco-conscious chains out there, and that’s becoming more relevant again as ESG concerns grow louder. Tezos is also rolling out new DevX improvements, making it easier for developers to write smart contracts in common programming languages, lowering the barrier to entry. This accessibility could bring in a new wave of Web3 builders—and that might be exactly what it needs to regain some of the attention it had in its early days. For anyone exploring solid projects that keep shipping quietly and consistently, Tezos is still worth keeping tabs on. Conclusion — Time to Rethink What the Best Cryptos to Invest in This Weekend Really Are Let’s be real: the market’s getting loud again. Coins are moving, narratives are shifting, and presales are finally being taken seriously by those who missed out on previous cycles. Tezos is adapting in smart, subtle ways.

With over $16.4 million raised, 25,200+ holders, and a real-world wallet solution, Qubetics doesn’t just promise utility—it’s already shipping it. Its presale is one of the most structured, promising campaigns running right now, and the ROI math speaks for itself. This weekend, those seriously scanning for the best cryptos to invest in this weekend should think twice about waiting. The window is open—but not for long.

Cardano ( ADA ) price dropped to a low of $0.70 on Sunday, down from the year-to-date high of $0.747. This article explores the top three reasons why the coin may jump by 70% and retest the key resistance level at $1.176. Cardano whales are buying The first bullish catalyst that may push the Cardano price higher is that whales are accumulating the coin. Santiment data shows that addresses holding between 10 million and 100 million ADA coins account for about 35.5% of all coins in circulation. The percentage stood at 33% in January. ADA holders with balances of between 1 million and 10 million have jumped to 15.83%. This whale activity is a sign that these investors anticipate more gains ahead. Historically, whale accumulation is seen as a better bullish catalyst than their dumping. Cardano whales are buying | Source: Santiment You might also like: Solana price eyes $200 as meme coins, stablecoins market cap soars ADA ETF approval and Bitcoin staking feature Cardano price will likely do well as odds of a spot ADA ETF rise now that the Securities and Exchange Commission has confirmed Paul Atkins as the new agency chair. Polymarket odds of this ETF approval happening this year have jumped to 55%. The SEC is reviewing over 70 crypto-related ETFs. Under Paul Atkins , it is likely that it will approve most of these funds. Most notably, the agency may also approve tokens with staking features, allowing ETF investors to earn monthly returns. Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of the Cardano blockchain platform, has continued to promise more Bitcoin ( BTC ) integration. The goal is to provide Bitcoin holders with a way to generate a return through a safer zero-knowledge solution. ZK proofs are better than centralized options like Celsius, which collapsed in 2022. Bitcoin staking on Cardano will be enabled by its sidechains, like Midnight and Midgard. Midnight will enable BTC to be represented on Cardano while maintaining transaction privacy. Cardano price has double-bottomed ADA price chart | Source: crypto.news The other catalyst for ADA price is that it has formed a double-bottom pattern at $0.510. A double bottom is usually a bullish sign, signaling that short-sellers hesitate to place short bets below a key price. Its neckline is at $1.176, its highest level on May 3. The coin also hovers at the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level, which is known as the golden ratio, where rebounds happen. It has also formed a small bullish flag pattern. Therefore, the Cardano price will likely have a bullish breakout in the coming weeks as bulls target the double-bottom’s neckline at $1.17, about 70% above the current level.

Although gaming tokens have been largely on the backseat post-2021 crypto excitement, this partnership has the potential to usher in a major industry revamp. The latest data by SoSoValue shows GameFi tokens have had a rough year, losing 62% of their value over the past 12 months. The discrepancy is a reminder of the sector’s challenges, especially when contrasted with the 174% increase in PayFi tokens. However, the tide could shift with the Trump administration’s crypto-friendly policies. Gala Games , the world’s premier blockchain games and entertainment company, officially announced its partnership with the White House, making it the first ever crypto gaming company to do so. The project is built on the Web3 Store of Value experimentation framework and a Web3 Easter Egg Hunt component party showcased as part of the 2025 White House Easter Egg Roll. Gala Games gained a lot of attention for supporting this event which held over the Easter weekend at easter.gala.games. The game provided families with a “free and easy” experience and introduced blockchain technology without overwhelming new users. Gala’s easter event spurs token surge and showcases a new vision for blockchain gaming After the partnership was revealed, Gala’s native token, GALA, saw an 18% jump in value. Meanwhile, GameFi tokens rose 13%, compared with a more modest gain of 8% in the broader crypto market. Gala’s Easter Egg Hunt enabled players to gather virtual eggs and earn special non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which all exist on GalaChain , a layer 1 protocol developed by Gala Games. Founded by Zynga co-founder Eric Schiermeyer in 2019, Gala Games has made inroads to attract big partners like DreamWorks Animation and NBCUniversal. The company has also partnered with the artist Snoop Dogg and established recent deals like the one with LG Electronics to bring Web3 entertainment to TVs. Gala’s desire to merge blockchain with entertainment is also distinctive, and the partnership with the White House only reinforces this message. Schiermeyer said he was excited about the collaboration and shared that the project focuses on the high-level tie-up. “We have a team dedicated to government outreach,” they said. “I also spent time at Mar-a-Lago and spoke with the President. But mainly, we wanted to help make the event more fun, and I think that sentiment was well received.” Industry voices applaud visibility but warn GameFi must solve deeper challenges The partnership has received mixed responses throughout the industry. On one hand, the visibility of the White House partnership has attracted plaudits more generally. According to Jack O’Holleran, CEO of SKALE Labs, poor visibility has always been a drag on GameFi’s growth. O’Holleran noted that previously, people had to manage their own crypto wallets and pay exorbitant gas fees to play. However, he noted that gasless blockchains and frictionless onboarding take away those obstacles. O’Holleran remains optimistic about the sector’s future, emphasizing that the functional values and utility blockchain brings to gaming are becoming increasingly undeniable. He noted that mainstream gaming platforms are essential to broader GameFi integration. O’Holleran proposed that if GameFi were to fit into traditional means of gaming seamlessly, it would potentially “unlock the floodgates” for a much broader player base than is currently the case with the crypto user count. Concurrently , Mitja Goroshevsky, co-founder of Gosh, commended the visibility of Gala Games and the GameFi sector via the White House tie-up. He warned that the industry is not out of the woods yet, and its identity crisis still looms. Goroshevsky continued to say that collaborations with governments benefit visibility; however, it will not be enough to bring mass adoption. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Plus: Shaq settles FTX lawsuit | Weekly Recap",https://crypto.news/trump-meme-coin-dinner-event-crypto-weekly-recap/,"Today’s edition of the weekly recap covers President Donald Trump’s planned dinner with top TRUMP token holders, Strategy’s continued Bitcoin acquisitions, and the new SEC chair’s pro-cryptocurrency stance. Trump plans dinner with top meme coin holders President Donald Trump intends to host an “intimate private dinner” on May 22 at Trump National Golf Club near Washington for the top 220 holders of TRUMP ( TRUMP ). The top 25 coin holders will receive additional privileges, including a pre-dinner reception with the President and a White House tour. Organizers of the $TRUMP Gala Dinner have stated in a legal disclaimer that they may cancel or reschedule the event at their discretion. If Trump cannot attend or the event is canceled for any reason, qualified token holders may receive a limited-edition TRUMP NFT instead. Democrats argue that the dinner is an impeachable offense since Trump is essentially “granting audiences to people” who buy his meme coin, which directly enriches the Trump family. New SEC chair criticizes previous leaders Recently sworn-in SEC Chair Paul Atkins delivered his first full address Friday and criticized the agency’s previous approach under former Chair Gary Gensler and the Biden administration. He stated that “innovation has unfortunately been stifled… due to market and regulatory uncertainty.” This is a common argument among crypto bulls. Gensler, during his tenure, felt that crypto didn’t need new rules — that most tokens were already unregistered securities, and existing law just needed to be enforced. Also, the crypto industry is plagued by scams and frequent collapses (i.e., FTX , Terra/Luna , Celsius , etc.). Retail investors lost billions of dollars. SEC drops cases, delays ETF decisions The Trump administration’s SEC promptly continues to drop numerous lawsuits and investigations against crypto companies; the latest benefactor of this lenient stance is blockchain technology firm Dragonchain . Similarly, Coinbase , Gemini , Uniswa and Ripple also benefitted. The SEC also withdrew its fraud case against Richard Schueler (known as Richard Heart), founder of HEX, PulseChain, and PulseX. Meanwhile, the agency extended its timeline for reviewing applications that would enable the listing of exchange-traded funds tracking Polkadot ( DOT ) and Hedera ( HBAR ). The delay also affects a proposed ETF based on the combined performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH ).

The treasury of El Salvador acquired 7 Bitcoin ( BTC ) worth over $650,000 in the seven days leading up to April 27, blockchain data from El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office shows . When asked about the country’s Bitcoin investments, Rodrigo Valdes, director of the Western Hemisphere Department at the IMF, said that the country continues to comply with its agreement to halt government Bitcoin accumulation.

Source: El Salvador Bitcoin Office “In terms of El Salvador, let me say that I can confirm that they continue to comply with their commitment of non-accumulation of Bitcoin by the overall fiscal sector, which is the performance criteria that we have,” said Valdes during an April 26 press briefing . Related: Crypto sentiment recovers, but weekend liquidity risks remain “But on top of that, I think this is very important for the discussion in El Salvador,” he added. “The program of El Salvador is not about Bitcoin. It’s much more, much deeper in structural reforms, in terms of governance, in terms of transparency.” In December 2024, El Salvador struck a deal with the IMF for a $1.4 billion loan, which required the government to drop Bitcoin’s status as a legal tender and stop its BTC accumulation.

Edwards claims that Bitcoin’s energy value, calculated based on mining costs and energy consumption, is approximately $130,000. This indicates that despite its current market price, Bitcoin is undervalued relative to its underlying energy consumption. Institutional Buying and Exchange Outflows On April 24, more than 8,756 BTC (around $830 million) were withdrawn from Coinbase, which could indicate institutional buying or ETF-related purchases. This aligns with recent Bitcoin ETF inflows, with Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noting that institutions have engaged in a $3 billion Bitcoin buying spree in recent days. Binance also saw a significant outflow of 27,750 BTC on April 25, marking the third-largest outflow in the exchange’s history. While such outflows often indicate bullish sentiment, analyst Joao Wedson cautioned that these large withdrawals do not automatically guarantee a continued rally. He pointed out that in 2021, massive outflows did not prevent a market downturn following China’s crypto ban. However, continuous outflows, like during the FTX collapse, often signal a market bottom and potential recovery. Bitcoin’s Fractal Patterns and the $100,000 Target Bitcoin’s performance over the past week mirrors similar patterns from Q4 2024, when the cryptocurrency saw a series of significant price increases. As seen in the 1-day chart, Bitcoin has risen by 11% between April 21-25, and analysts suggest that a further 7-10% increase could push Bitcoin above the $100,000 mark in the near future. While fractal patterns can offer insight into potential price movements, they are not always reliable. Unlike Q4 2024, when Bitcoin rallied without major resistance, the current overhead resistance level at $96,100 could prevent a breakout. However, if Bitcoin can break through this level, a surge above $100,000 could be within reach. Conclusion Bitcoin’s recent performance and bullish forecasts suggest it may continue to rise, with potential price targets ranging from $130,000 to $200,000 by the end of 2025. Factors like Bitcoin’s energy value, institutional buying, and the relationship between Bitcoin and gold all play a role in shaping its market dynamics. With strong outflows from exchanges and a weakening US Dollar, Bitcoin appears to be in a favorable position for further growth. However, key resistance levels and market conditions will determine how quickly it can reach new highs. Bitcoin’s Intrinsic Value and Market Movements in Focus Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading at a notable 40% discount to its intrinsic value, according to Charles Edwards, the founder of Capriole Investments. Edwards argues that Bitcoin’s true value, based on energy consumption and mining costs, stands at $130,000, significantly higher than its current market price. Bitcoin’s Energy Value and Discounted Price Edwards recently shared insights on X, explaining that since Bitcoin’s April 2024 halving event, which reduced block rewards to 3.125 BTC, the cryptocurrency’s energy value has remained significantly above its market price. This suggests that Bitcoin is undervalued, offering potential for substantial price appreciation in the future. Coinbase, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, experienced a substantial outflow of Bitcoin on April 24, with more than 8,756 BTC (around $830 million) being withdrawn. This negative netflow may signal growing institutional interest or the purchase of Bitcoin via exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which reflect a strong underlying demand for the asset. Institutional Interest and ETF Activity The outflows from Coinbase align with recent spot Bitcoin ETF inflows, which have garnered attention from institutional investors. Bloomberg’s ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that institutions have been on a $3 billion Bitcoin buying spree, suggesting that large investors are increasingly confident in Bitcoin’s future prospects. Binance also saw significant Bitcoin outflows on April 25, with 27,750 BTC withdrawn. This marks the third-largest outflow in Binance’s history. While such withdrawals often indicate bullish sentiment, analyst Joao Wedson warned that large outflows do not always lead to sustained price increases. He pointed out that in 2021, significant outflows did not prevent a market decline triggered by China’s crypto ban. However, he also noted that continued outflows over several days, similar to the FTX collapse, could indicate a market bottom and a potential recovery. Bitcoin’s Fractal Patterns and Price Predictions Bitcoin’s recent performance mirrors the behavior seen in late 2024, particularly in November, when the cryptocurrency posted significant gains. Bitcoin’s price increased by 11% from April 21 to 25, showing similar buying pressure to previous rallies. If the price maintains this momentum, Bitcoin could see a 7-10% rise over the coming days, potentially pushing the cryptocurrency above the $100,000 mark. However, analysts caution that fractal patterns, while insightful, are not always reliable. Unlike Q4 2024, when Bitcoin rallied without resistance, Bitcoin currently faces overhead resistance at $96,100. If Bitcoin can overcome this resistance level, a breakout above $100,000 could follow. The Role of the US Dollar in Bitcoin’s Rally Bitcoin’s rally is also being influenced by the weakening US Dollar. On April 21, the DXY (US Dollar Index) dropped to a three-year low, which has historically been a bullish indicator for Bitcoin. The DXY’s decline could signal a shift in market conditions that benefits risk assets like Bitcoin. As crypto analyst ‘Venture Founder’ explained: “Traditionally, DXY going down is very bullish for $BTC, we now have a massive bearish divergence for DXY, which may suggest it goes to 90. The last 2 times this happened triggered a Bitcoin parabolic bull run in the final phase of the bull market (lasting 12 months).” Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Bullish Prospects Bitcoin’s recent price activity, its intrinsic value based on energy consumption, and institutional interest through ETF inflows all suggest a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. While significant outflows from exchanges like Coinbase and Binance are encouraging, the market faces key resistance levels that could impact Bitcoin’s near-term performance. However, the broader market dynamics, including the weakening US Dollar, indicate that Bitcoin is well-positioned for continued growth. With the potential for Bitcoin to reach $100,000 or beyond, the outlook for 2025 remains optimistic.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-27 13:45:23

Bitcoin treasury firms driving $200 trillion hyperbitcoinization — Adam Back Investment firms with Bitcoin-focused treasuries are front-running global Bitcoin adoption , which may see the world’s first cryptocurrency soar to a $200 trillion market capitalization in the coming decade. Institutions and governments worldwide are starting to recognize the unique monetary properties of Bitcoin ( BTC ), according to Adam Back, co-founder and CEO of Blockstream and the inventor of Hashcash. “$MSTR and other treasury companies are an arbitrage of the dislocation between the bitcoin future and todays fiat world,” Back wrote in an April 26 X post. “A sustainable and scalable $100-$200 trillion trade front-running hyperbitcoinization. scalable enough for most big listed companies to move to btc treasury,” he added. Hyperbitcoinization refers to the theoretical future where Bitcoin soars to become the largest global currency, replacing fiat money due to its inflationary economics and growing distrust in the legacy financial system. Source: Adam Back Bitcoin’s price outpacing fiat money inflation remains the main driver of global hyperbitcoinization, Back said, adding: “Some people think treasury strategy is a temporary glitch. i’m saying no it's a logical and sustainable arbitrage. but not for ever, the driver is bitcoin price going up over 4 year periods faster than interest and inflation.” US crypto rules like “floor is lava” game without lights — Hester Peirce SEC Commissioner and head of the crypto task force , Hester Peirce, says US financial firms are navigating crypto in a way that’s similar to playing the children’s game “the floor is lava,” but in the dark. “It is time that we find a way to end this game. We need to turn on the lights and build some walkways over the lava pit,” Peirce said at the SEC “Know Your Custodian” roundtable event on April 25. Peirce explained that SEC registrants are forced to approach crypto-related activities like “the floor is lava,” where the aim is to jump from one piece of furniture to the next without touching the ground, except here, touching crypto directly is the lava. “A D.C. version of this game is our regulatory approach to crypto assets, and crypto asset custody in particular,” she said. Peirce said that, much like in the game, firms wanting to engage with crypto must avoid directly holding it due to unclear regulatory rules. “To engage in crypto-related activities, SEC-registrants have had to hop from one poorly illuminated regulatory space to the next, all while ensuring that they never touch any crypto asset,” Peirce said. Deloitte predicts $4 trillion tokenized real estate on blockchain by 2035 Over $4 trillion worth of real estate could be tokenized on blockchain networks during the next decade, potentially offering investors greater access to property ownership opportunities, according to a new report. The Deloitte Center for Financial Services predicts that over $4 trillion worth of real estate may be tokenized by 2035, up from less than $300 billion in 2024. The report, published April 24, estimates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of more than 27%. The $4 trillion of tokenized property is predicted to stem from the benefits of blockchain-based assets, as well as a structural shift across real estate and property ownership.

Speaking at the SEC’s “Know Your Custodian” roundtable event on April 25, Peirce, who also heads the agency’s crypto task force, said it is time to bring clarity and structure to the space. “It is time that we find a way to end this game. We need to turn on the lights and build some walkways over the lava pit,” Peirce further added. Peirce on Unclear Regulatory Guidelines In her remarks, Peirce explained that SEC-registered firms are effectively forced to avoid direct contact with crypto assets because of unclear regulatory guidance. Much like the game where players must avoid touching the ground, firms must “hop from one poorly illuminated regulatory space to the next,” she said, without directly holding crypto assets. The confusion is particularly acute for investment advisers, who often struggle to determine which crypto assets qualify as securities , which custodians are deemed qualified, and whether engaging in staking or voting could trigger violations. “The twist in the regulatory version is that it is largely played in the dark: burning legal lava and no lamps to illuminate the way,” Peirce noted. She added that the lack of clear rules prevents brokers and alternative trading systems (ATS) from managing crypto assets efficiently, making it difficult for a robust market to develop in the United States. Here’s What Others Exec Believe Echoing her concerns, SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda stressed that financial firms working with crypto must have access to qualified custodial services that meet legal standards. Uyeda also suggested that allowing advisers to use state-chartered, limited-purpose trust companies for crypto custody could be a step in the right direction. Meanwhile, newly appointed SEC Chair Paul Atkins expressed optimism about blockchain’s future, noting its potential for improving efficiency, transparency, risk management, and cost savings across financial markets. Atkins emphasized that one of his top priorities would be to create “clear regulatory rules of the road” for digital assets, acknowledging that regulatory uncertainty under the previous administration had been a major obstacle. “I look forward to engaging with market participants and working with colleagues in President Trump’s administration and Congress to establish a rational fit-for-purpose framework for crypto assets,” Atkins said.

Well, according to popular analyst Michael van de Poppe, the green lights are finally flashing for altcoins. With global liquidity on the rise and a shift away from gold, things are looking promising. The table might just be turning, and a new rally could be right around the corner. More Money Is Flowing Into the Markets Over the past few quarters, altcoins have struggled badly, leaving many investors disappointed. However, Michael van de Poppe explains that global liquidity is growing fast. China is already adding more money into the economy, Europe has lowered its interest rates, and the U.S. might lower rates soon, too. #Altcoins Turn Bull after Longest Bear Market It's been an absolutely horrific bear markets for altcoins and a lot of expectations have crushed in the past quarter. I've spend all my time figuring out what has happened. Indicators show green. Let's discuss them First of… pic.twitter.com/E7uDXK8gpB — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) April 27, 2025 When more money flows into the system, risky assets like Bitcoin and altcoins usually do well. Van de Poppe believes this could fuel a strong rally across crypto markets higher over the next several months. Gold Surge Cooling Off Another important signal comes from the gold market. Gold has massively outperformed other assets by 20% since 2022, as investors rushed towards safety during uncertain times. But now, gold prices seem to be peaking. Van de Poppe believes that as gold slows down , investors will slowly move back into riskier assets like altcoins. Historically, whenever gold took a breather, crypto markets saw strong recoveries, and this time could be no different. Chinese Currency Shows a Key Turning Point Interestingly, van de Poppe also pointed to the Chinese Renminbi’s (CNH) performance against the U.S. Dollar (USD). In past cycles, whenever CNH/USD bottomed out, altcoins like ETH started rising fast. The same thing happened in the summer of 2019 — after CNH/USD hit a low, altcoins went on a strong two-year rally. Now, the CNH chart has shown another deep drop, which could mean that altcoins are getting ready for a new rally. This pattern from the past makes the chances of a new altcoin bull run even stronger. Institutions Are Changing the Game Finally, van de Poppe says that big institutions are now shaping the crypto market. Instead of just following the old 4-year cycles, investors now have to watch global money flows and economic events. After the longest bear market in altcoin history, things are finally starting to look better. The next 12 to 18 months could be very exciting for altcoins. Sign oF Shifting Interest Recently, Coinpedia News reported a change in crypto market focus, with more attention shifting to altcoins.

The product will be built using Bridge, the stablecoin payments platform Stripe acquired in October 2024 for $1.1 billion. Stripe Preparing To Test A New Stablecoin Product Stripe CEO Patrick Collison announced in a X post that the company has been planning a stablecoin payments product for nearly 10 years and is now opening it up to pilot users. The move gained traction after Stripe recently obtained regulatory approval to acquire the Bridge, a payments platform founded by former Coinbase exes Zach Abrams and Sean Yu. Bridge’s network offers an alternative to traditional banking rails like SWIFT for cross-border transactions. Stripe developer Jen Kim revealed that the stablecoin is “ready to start testing.” During that process, the company is soliciting customer feedback. Kim noted that the product targets clients outside the US, the European Union, and the UK. In a follow-up post, Kim claimed that within the first three months of offering stablecoin services, customers from over 90 countries paid with stablecoins via an invoice or checkout. Stablecoin Sector Is Experiencing Tremendous Growth Stripe has a long history with crypto. It was the first major payment processor to integrate Bitcoin payments back in 2014, though it pulled the plug in 2018, citing the top crypto’s slow transaction speeds and high fees. The payments firm began rebuilding its crypto team in 2021 as part of a renewed push into the space. Stripe’s stablecoin pilot project comes at a time when a wide variety of entities, ranging from crypto-native firms to TradFi banks, are making steps to grab a piece of the fast-growing sector. PayPal and Ripple have all launched their own U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins in recent years. As of April 27, the stablecoin market cap stands at $239.11 billion, according to DefiLlama. Notably, Citi predicted in a recent report that stablecoins could be a “ChatGPT” moment for blockchain adoption in 2025. In its base case, the bank envisions the asset class potentially ballooning to $1.6 trillion by 2030 from the current valuation, bolstered by regulations being laid down globally and institutional adoption. In Citi’s more upbeat scenario, the market could rocket to an eye-popping $3.7 trillion.",Cryptocurrency|News|stablecoin|stripe,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-27 13:54:28

From conflicting headlines about President Donald Trump's tariffs against other nations to total confusion about which assets to seek shelter in, it has been one for the record books. Amid all the confusion, when traditional ""haven assets"" failed to act as safe places to park money, one bright spot emerged that might have surprised some market participants: bitcoin. ""Historically, cash (the US dollar), bonds (US Treasuries), the Swiss Franc, and gold have fulfilled that role [safe haven], with bitcoin edging in on some of that territory,"" said NYDIG Research in a note. NYDIG's data showed that while gold and Swiss Franc had been consistent safe-haven winners, since 'Liberation Day'—when President Trump announced sweeping tariff hikes on April 2, kicking off extreme volatility in the market—bitcoin has been added to the list. ""Bitcoin has acted less like a liquid levered version of levered US equity beta and more like the non-sovereign issued store of value that it is,"" NYDIG wrote. Zooming out, it seems that as the ""sell America"" trade gains momentum, investors are taking notice of bitcoin and the original promise of the biggest cryptocurrency.

At the same time, Parker White, another Kraken veteran, has assumed the roles of chief operating officer and chief investment officer. John Han, who previously worked at both Binance and Kraken, has joined as CFO. This new leadership team has implemented a treasury strategy centered around Solana as part of the company’s strategic redirection. To speed up its investments in the Solana network, the publicly traded company recently obtained a convertible note facility of up to $500 million. In addition to the $1 billion shelf registration, DeFi Development has applied to register 1.24 million shares on behalf of early investors. This includes prominent crypto venture capital firms Pantera Capital and Arrington Capital and Payward, the parent company of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken.

The agreement was formalized on April 26 during a high-level meeting between WLFI co-founders Zak Folkman, Zach Witkoff, and Chase Herro, alongside Pakistan’s Prime Minister and senior government officials. The partnership aims to accelerate blockchain innovation by establishing regulatory sandboxes to test blockchain-based financial solutions. WLFI Partnership with Pakistan Targets DeFi Growth Key areas of collaboration include advancing DeFi protocols, exploring tokenization of real-world assets like real estate and commodities, expanding stablecoin use for remittances and trade, and offering strategic guidance on blockchain infrastructure and regulatory frameworks. “Pakistan’s youth and technology sector are our greatest assets. Through partnerships like this, we are opening new doors for investment, innovation, and global leadership in the blockchain economy,” stated Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb. With over 25 million active crypto users and approximately $300 billion in annual crypto transactions, Pakistan is emerging as a significant player in the digital economy. The country’s youthful demographic—over 64% under the age of 30—positions it well for rapid blockchain adoption. Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council , highlighted that the collaboration is designed to empower Pakistan’s young population and integrate the country into the evolving landscape of global finance. Bin Saqib also recently joined WLFI as an advisor, further strengthening ties between the two entities.

These developments follow reports from The Wall Street Journal suggesting that the Trump family has been in talks to acquire a stake in Binance.US, potentially through WLFI. Steve Witkoff, Trump’s chief negotiator and father of WLFI co-founder Zach Witkoff, reportedly led discussions with Binance. Meanwhile, WLFI recently launched its USD1 stablecoin on BNB Chain and Ethereum, following a $550 million public token sale—marking another milestone in its expanding DeFi footprint. Pakistan Signals Policy Shift with Plans for National Crypto Council Pakistan’s Finance Ministry is taking steps toward formal cryptocurrency regulation , which could significantly change the country’s historically cautious stance on digital assets. In a meeting last month with an international delegation focused on crypto investment and blockchain development, Aurangzeb emphasized the importance of exploring the sector’s potential rather than dismissing it outright. The delegation included notable figures such as Gentry Beach Jr., a key investor who has pledged $1 billion in funding to Pakistan, along with tech entrepreneur Nikita Goldsmith, blockchain consultant Alex Malkov, and Cosmic Wire CEO Jerad Finck. The proposed National Crypto Council would function as a government advisory body, bringing together regulators, policymakers, and industry stakeholders to guide the development of cryptocurrency and blockchain regulations. This marks a clear shift from previous government positions. Until recently, both the State Bank of Pakistan and former finance officials firmly opposed cryptocurrency adoption, citing financial risks and regulatory uncertainty.

So, the president and Congress cannot dismiss the Fed chair and appoint a new one to enact the monetary policies they support. The Fed is set up to be an independent central bank. But, Trump’s pressure campaign on Powell could get him to cut interest rates again. He did last time Trump was in office after the president publicly pressed him to cut rates unlike anything the US has seen in recent history. Trump Pressures Powell to Cut Rates Trump is not the most traditional guy when it suits him not to be. It is unusual for the president to lobby the Fed chair to set rate policy. It’s not common either for presidents to pepper their messages with insults for emphasis. But Trump is an economist, business executive, and micromanager. When it comes to policies, he sees them as the linchpins to exercising the government’s power in a realistically useful way. He also has a sarcastic, thorny Steve Jobs/Jack Welch leadership personality. As if to back the president on rate cuts, the S&P 500 closed 2.5% lower a day after he began pummeling Jerome Powell for more rate cuts earlier in April. Will History Repeat for Bitcoin Prices? In a post on his Truth Social media app, Trump said the economy is at risk of slowing down “unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.” Meanwhile, his push for a US Bitcoin reserve is sparking off a new global arms race for BTC. If he gets the rate cuts, Bitcoin’s price could also skyrocket again. Right around this time in 2019, BTC traded for $5K and Trump was playing the same game. In the next 12 months or so, the Fed eventually cut rates to zero. 12 months after that, BTC traded for $60K. The last Friday in April, Bitcoin was poking above $95,000 with bulls eyeing $100,000 .

For instance, Dogecoin — the largest meme coin by market capitalization — lost over 55% of its value in the first quarter of 2025. However, things seem to be looking up for the DOGE token, as its price jumped by nearly 15% in the past week. According to the latest on-chain observation, this recent rally might just be the beginning of another leg up for the meme coin over the coming weeks. Is A Sustained Bull Run On The Cards For DOGE? In an April 26 post on the X platform, pseudonymous crypto analyst Cryptollica posited that the price of Dogecoin could be gearing up for an extended bullish period over the next few weeks. This projection is based on the changes in the MVRV metric, which tracks the ratio of a coin’s market cap to its realized cap. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Reaches Last H1 Support, Next Major Resistance Comes Into View The MVRV ratio basically tells how much value the investors hold (the market cap) against the value they put in (the realized cap). Hence, when the value of this metric is greater than 1, it means that more investors are in profit at the moment. Meanwhile, a less-than-one value implies that most of the market is in the red. As such, a high MVRV ratio is generally viewed as a price top signal because investors show more propensity to offload their assets when they are in profit. On the flip side, when the metric is below the “1” threshold, it suggests that the market might be bottoming out. As observed in the chart above, the Dogecoin MVRV ratio seems to be thickening in and around the “1” threshold level. Besides its on-chain significance, this level has proven pivotal in certain trend reversals seen in the past, with the DOGE price bouncing back to a new local high each time the MVRV ratio persists around this mark. The price of Dogecoin surged by 1,900% and 2,200% in August 2017 and August 2020, respectively, when the MVRV ratio was at its current level. The last time it was around this level in August 2024, the DOGE price rallied by more than 400% to surpass $0.5. Going by the historical precedent, there is a likelihood that the DOGE price could be preparing for a significant upward movement. Considering the improving market climate, a sustained bullish run might not seem completely out of the question anymore at this point. Dogecoin Price At A Glance After briefly touching the $0.19 mark in the early hours of Saturday, April 19, the DOGE price appears to have cooled off. As of this writing, the price of DOGE is hovering around $0.18, reflecting a 0.3% decline in the past 24 hours.

Optimism is driving Ethereum’s Layer-2 expansion, allowing faster and cheaper transactions—essential for mass adoption moving forward. VeChain continues to stand out in supply chain solutions, providing real-world use cases that link blockchain with logistics and product tracking.

Earlier this week, the Fed – alongside the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) – rescinded many guidelines and statements made toward how banks can conduct crypto activities. As stated by the Fed at the time, “The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced the withdrawal of guidance for banks related to their crypto-asset and dollar token activities and related changes to its expectations for these activities. These actions ensure the Board’s expectations remain aligned with evolving risks and further support innovation in the banking system.” However, according to Lummis, the Fed’s actions are superficial because they still use reputation risk when supervising banks. Lummis also says the Fed hasn’t withdrawn the policy that deems Bitcoin ( BTC ) and crypto as unsafe and unsound. She also says the Fed openly disregards the law when it comes to crypto banks applying for master accounts, which is the record of the account holder’s financial rights and obligations with respect to the administering reserve bank. Lastly, Lummis points out that the Fed still employs the same staff that tried to stifle the digital assets industry using regulations under the Biden Administration. Last month, Lummis, alongside Republican Representative Nick Begich, introduced a landmark bill to use the top crypto asset by market cap as a strategic reserve asset. The bill was introduced after President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish BTC as a reserve asset.

XRP is currently trading around $0.617, down by 0.63% in the last 24 hours. This comes as Bitcoin has also retreated slightly after touching the $95,700 resistance level last week. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s supply on exchanges continues to drop, which could lead to a supply crunch if demand stays strong. Some analysts believe this could eventually push prices higher. This week is also massive for the broader financial market, with about 40% of the S&P 500 companies reporting earnings. Big names like Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple will release their results. These earnings calls could influence U.S. government policies, especially if major companies express concern over economic challenges like tariffs. XRP has remained under pressure since its January peak, partly due to macro factors and regulatory uncertainty. However, recent on-chain data shows that over 838 million XRP were moved in just 24 hours—signaling strong network activity, though not necessarily immediate price gains. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has indirectly hinted at XRP’s potential to match Bitcoin’s price one day. Speaking about XRP’s role in solving trillion-dollar financial problems, Garlinghouse said that Ripple works closely with banks and regulators—even in uncertain environments.

CleanSpark's March production hit a record 706 Bitcoins, with plans to boost capacity by 18% by mid-2025. The company's cost per Bitcoin mined has dropped to $34k, enhancing gross margins and operational efficiency. CleanSpark trades at a modest 4.8x EV/adjusted EBITDA multiple, offering significant upside potential if Bitcoin prices stabilize or rise. The stock market isn't the only asset class that has seen a major relief rally over the past week: cryptocurrencies have joined in on the party too, and as of the time of writing, Bitcoin has rallied back very close to the critical $100k threshold. This upswing benefits crypto miners, which are still shaken by recent price volatility. CleanSpark ( CLSK ), one of the most notable and publicly traded miners, is still down ~5% since January and down ~50% over the past year. The question for investors now is: is CleanSpark overdue its rebound? Data by YCharts I last wrote a bullish note on CleanSpark in January, when the stock was trading higher at ~$10 per share (and when Bitcoin was also trading at similar ~$95k levels). Given price stabilization in the crypto market, plus new operational improvements on CleanSpark's end that are allowing CleanSpark to produce more Bitcoin at a lower cost, I'm reiterating my buy rating on CleanSpark. Increasing capacity, lowering cost Let's start with the obvious: Bitcoin prices are outside of CleanSpark's control, and while the stock will always see correlation with the broader crypto market, investors who have a long-term belief in the durability of Bitcoin's relevance and market value should focus on CleanSpark's operational progress, which is where management is focusing its attention as well. CleanSpark just reported mining results for the month of March, as it does every month. CleanSpark March bitcoin production (CleanSpark March mining update) As shown in the chart above, the company produced 706 Bitcoin (worth $85.2 million, at current prices of $94k per coin). Note that this is the highest monthly production rate for CleanSpark on record. In February, the company had mined 624 Bitcoin; throughout the second half of 2024, the company had averaged between 620-605 Bitcoin per month, so this improvement translates to a ~10% increase in production. The company achieved this by adding a new low-cost facility in Wyoming, adding 2 EH/s (exahash per second, representing one quintillion ""hashes"" per second, which are computations that Bitcoin mining computers solve to receive blockchain rewards). As shown as well above, the company's total mining capacity is currently 42.4 EH/s, with a target to improve to 50 EH/s (a further 18% improvement) by the end of the first half of 2025. What seemingly gets less credit, however, is the fact that CleanSpark is reducing the cost per coin production as well, effectively improving its ""gross margin"" per Bitcoin mined. CleanSpark doesn't report mining cost each month alongside production results, but in its most recent quarter (reported February), the company noted that its fiscal Q1 (December quarter) had an average mining cost of ""approximately $34,000."" That's a significant improvement versus $36,250 in fiscal Q4 (the September quarter), and as long as CleanSpark continues to add mining capacity in low-cost areas such as Wyoming, where land is plentiful and energy is cheap, the company can continue to improve its marginal cost per coin. We note as well that CleanSpark barely sells any Bitcoin (only 14.2 in March at an average price of $87.7k, versus 706 produced), preferring to build up its treasury and selling only as needed to sustain operations. A business with tremendous earnings power CleanSpark is a tough business to value, given the fluctuating price of Bitcoin, its constantly changing production rate, and shifting energy costs. And yet to get a good grounding on what this business is worth, I like to construct a conservative, yet simple P&L around this company's prospects. Let's start with revenue. If we assume the company can continue running at its March production rate of 706 coins, it will produce 8,472 Bitcoins per year, or $796 million in revenue at current prices of $94k/coin. At a cost per coin of $34k, each Bitcoin would produce $60k in gross margin, or $508.3 million in gross margin dollars per year. The final piece is operating expenses. In FY24, the company reported $528.0 million in total costs, which was inclusive of $165.5 million in mining costs which we calculated separately above. CleanSpark opex (CleanSpark Q4'24 earnings release) If we take include only the true operating expenses (professional fees, payroll expense, and G&A expense) - CleanSpark's ""pro forma"" opex is $118.1 million, with the other costs related to depreciation/amortization and impairment not accounted for in an adjusted EBITDA figure. If we conservatively assume that CleanSpark will grow opex by ~15% in FY25 (which corresponds to its planned EH/s capacity growth through the first half), opex would be $135.8 million. This gives us an approximate adjusted EBITDA of $372.5 million ($508.3 million in gross margin dollars, less $135.8 million in pro forma operating costs excluding depreciation/amortization). This represents 52% y/y growth over $245.8 million in adjusted EBITDA in FY24. Valuation and risks/opportunities to the earnings forecast Despite operating a growing and efficient business with seemingly rich earnings potential, CleanSpark trades at very modest multiples. At current share prices near $9, CleanSpark's market cap is just $2.53 billion. Meanwhile, its latest December balance sheet showed $277.6 million in cash and investments, alongside $648.6 million in debt - or a $371.0 million net debt position. Its enterprise value, excluding the value of its Bitcoin holdings, is $2.90 billion. Of course, as we previously mentioned, CleanSpark is stingy when it comes to selling its mined Bitcoin, and it's sitting on a trove of crypto value. As of its March mining update, the company notes that it has 11,869 coins in its treasury, worth $1.11 billion at current market prices of $94k. This means that CleanSpark's true enterprise value, including the value of its Bitcoin holdings, is $1.79 billion. This means that CleanSpark trades at just a 4.8x EV/adjusted EBITDA multiple, assuming the ~50% y/y growth in adjusted EBITDA as I've laid out above. Of course, the major risk to CleanSpark's earnings power is the price of Bitcoin itself. To take an extreme example of price risk: at the absolute lowest point of the post-tariffs market volatility, Bitcoin briefly dipped to $76k before rallying back above $90k. Bitcoin price history ( coinmarketcap.com ) If prices of Bitcoin stabilize at $76k, assuming no change in mining cost, CleanSpark would shed $18k in gross margin dollars per coin mined, or $152.5 million of risk to adjusted EBITDA - or a ~40% hit to the $372.5 million adjusted EBITDA used as the basis of my valuation. Of course, this downside risk could also be upside risk, if the price of Bitcoin rallies instead of falls. Another major opportunity to this earnings forecast is that we assumed flat production to March (706 coins per month), even though CleanSpark is investing resources into increasing its capacity to 50 EH/s, 18% higher than its current March production run rate. Key takeaways To me, CleanSpark remains a very compelling buy as the company increases its production rate, cuts down on cost per coin mined, and maintains its policy of holding bitcoin for investment - leading to a sizable balance sheet. Investors are rightly nervous about recent price volatility in Bitcoin, which is likely the main cause of CleanSpark's discounted valuation. In my view, however, if you're looking for some exposure to cryptocurrency in your portfolio, this Bitcoin miner is a more solid long-term investment than Bitcoin itself, largely because of the company's track record for increasing production capacity and lowering its marginal cost of mining.

A one-size-fits-all approach cannot be achieved to regulate DeFi. The industry needs custom, risk-based approaches that balance innovation, security and compliance. DeFi’s challenges and rules A common critique is that regulatory scrutiny leads to the death of innovation, tracing this situation back to the Biden administration. In 2022, uncertainty for crypto businesses increased following lawsuits against Coinbase, Binance and OpenSea for alleged violations of securities laws. Under the US administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission agreed to dismiss the lawsuit against Coinbase , as the agency reversed the crypto stance, hinting at a path toward regulation with clear boundaries. Many would argue that the same risk is the same rule. Imposing traditional finance requirements on DeFi simply will not work from many aspects but the most technical challenges. Openness, transparency, immutability, and automation are key parameters of DeFi. Without clear regulations, however, the prevalent issue of “Ponzi-like schemes” can divert focus from effective innovation use cases to conjuring a “deceptive perception” of blockchain technology. Guidance and clarity from regulatory bodies can reduce significant risks for retail users. Policymakers should take time to understand DeFi’s architecture before introducing restrictive measures. DeFi needs risk-based regulatory models that understand its architecture and address illicit activity and consumer protection. Self-regulatory frameworks cultivate transparency and security in DeFi The entire industry highly recommends implementing a self-regulatory framework that ensures continuous innovation while simultaneously ensuring consumer safety and financial transparency. Take the example of DeFi platforms that have taken a self-regulatory approach by implementing robust security measures, including transaction monitoring, wallet screening and implementing a blacklist mechanism that restricts a wallet of suspicion with illicit activity. Sound security measures would help DeFi projects monitor onchain activity and prevent system misuse. Self-regulation can help DeFi projects operate with greater legitimacy, yet it may not be the only solution. Clear structure and governance are key It’s no secret that institutional players are waiting for the regulatory green light. Adding to the list of regulatory frameworks, Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) sets stepping stones for future DeFi regulations that can lead to institutional adoption of DeFi. It provides businesses with regulatory clarity and a framework to operate. Many crypto projects will struggle and die as a result of higher compliance costs associated with MiCA, which will enforce a more reliable ecosystem by requiring augmented transparency from issuers and quickly attract institutional capital for innovation. Clear regulations will lead to more investments in projects that support investor trust. Anonymity in crypto is quickly disappearing. Blockchain analytics tools, regulators and companies can monitor suspicious activity while preserving user privacy to some extent. Future adaptations of MiCA regulations can enable compliance-focused DeFi solutions, such as compliant liquidity pools and blockchain-based identity verification. Regulatory clarity can break barriers to DeFi integration The banks’ iron gate has been another significant barrier. Compliance officers frequently witness banks erect walls to keep crypto out. Bank supervisors distance companies that are out of compliance, even if it’s indirect scrutiny or fines, slamming doors on crypto projects’ financial operations. Clear regulations will address this issue and make compliance a facilitator, not a barrier, for DeFi and banking integration. In the future, traditional banks will integrate DeFi. Institutions will not replace banks but will merge DeFi’s efficiencies with TradFi’s structure. Recent: Hester Peirce calls for SEC rulemaking to ‘bake in’ crypto regulation The repeal of Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 in January 2025 mitigated accounting burdens for banks to recognize crypto assets held for customers as both assets and liabilities on their balance sheets. The previous laws created hurdles of increased capital reserve requirements and other regulatory challenges. SAB 122 aims to provide structured solutions from reactive compliance to proactive financial integration — a step toward creating DeFi and banking synergy. Crypto companies must still follow accounting principles and disclosure requirements to protect crypto assets. Clear regulations can increase the frequency of banking use cases, such as custody, reserve backing, asset tokenization, stablecoin issuance and offering accounts to digital asset businesses. Building bridges between regulators and innovators in DeFi Experts pointing out concerns about DeFi’s over-regulation killing innovation can now address them using “regulatory sandboxes.” These dispense startups with a “secure zone” to test their products before committing to full-scale regulatory mandates. For example, startups in the United Kingdom under the Financial Conduct Authority are thriving using this “trial and error” method that has accelerated innovation. These have enabled businesses to test innovation and business models in a real-world setting under regulator supervision. Sandboxes could be accessible to licensed entities, unregulated startups or companies outside the financial services sector. Similarly, the European Union’s DLT Pilot Regime advances innovation and competition, encouraging market entry for startups by reducing upfront compliance costs through “gates” that align legal frameworks at each level while upgrading technological innovation. Clear regulations can cultivate and support innovation through open dialogue between regulators and innovators. Opinion by: Hedi Navazan, chief compliance officer at 1inch.

McGlone pointed to the 200-day moving average ( MA ) of the U.S. Treasury 10-year yield, which is now on the verge of turning lower after reaching its highest levels in nearly two decades. Cryptos have stalled vs. beta may lead deflation.

Reversing gains Regarding the current market’s fragility, specifically Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) unique role, he cautioned that the asset’s historic rally, which began in 2009 as the stock market bottomed, could now be reversing. When a highly speculative risk asset has to go up, what's the risk? Bitcoin began trading in 2009 when the stock market bottomed, but that historic run could be reverting. Now there's 14-million cryptos noted on CoinMarketCap, most of which depend on Bitcoin to go up for… pic.twitter.com/ZsCLvddijx — Mike McGlone (@mikemcglone11) April 26, 2025 Adding to concerns is the explosive growth in the number of cryptocurrencies, many of which rely heavily on Bitcoin’s strength for survival. Furthermore, he noted that the massive liquidity injections during the pandemic years created one of the largest money pumps in history, inflating asset prices across the board. Thus, a crash in crypto markets could be the first sign that the era of easy money is over, potentially triggering a sharp asset deflation and broader market turmoil. The strategist’s caution comes at a unique moment when cryptocurrencies seek to hit new highs after largely remaining in a consolidated state amid the tariff-induced downturn. Indeed, as signs emerged that the United States might be reaching a deal with China, Bitcoin, alongside stocks, traded higher, with the maiden digital currency surpassing the $90,000 mark. As of press time, BTC was trading at $94,089 with modest losses of less than 0.1% over the last 24 hours, while on the weekly chart, BTC is up over 11%. Bitcoin seven-day price chart.

The current price is nearly double their previous selling price. On-chain analyst Ember CN reported that the whale used 5.196 million USDC to re-enter the market and paid an average price of $15.39 per TRUMP ( TRUMP ) token. This purchase follows the investor’s previous decision to sell 630,000 TRUMP tokens at $8.70 each. This was just 20 hours before the announcement of a dinner event with former President Trump, which caused the token’s value to surge. “He missed the explosive surge after the dinner plan was announced. Today, he got back in at $15.39,” Ember CN noted . The timing of the investor’s initial sale was unfortunate, as they missed potential profits of approximately $3.8 million by exiting their position before the price spike.

This has positively impacted the token’s value but drew scrutiny from Democratic lawmakers. According to the official TRUMP leaderboard , the largest holder currently possesses over 1.22 million tokens, while the second-place position holds approximately 1.19 million. Meanwhile, other traders have been actively restructuring their portfolios to capitalize on the TRUMP token’s surge. Blockchain analytics platform Lookonchain identified one particularly successful trader who swapped their entire holdings of 1.18 million Fartcoin (worth approximately $1.22 million) for 78,671 TRUMP tokens. A smart trader swapped all 1.18M $Fartcoin($1.22M) positions for 78,671 $TRUMP 18 hours ago. This trader made 5 swing trades in $Fartcoin, each of which was profitable, with a 100% win rate and a total profit of $669K. https://t.co/GultwHyGqp pic.twitter.com/NJEoY62wKF — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) April 27, 2025 The TRUMP token’s value had jumped close to 90% by the dinner event announcement. However, the meme coin is still down by close to 80% since its all-time high of $73. The promise of direct access to the former president has created a competition among holders trying to maintain their ranking on the leaderboard to secure an invitation.

Right now, four names are quietly aligning themselves for serious upside: XRP , Solana , Bitcoin , and the fast-rising MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . As larger players consolidate strength, a fresh wave of opportunities is forming underneath—and for smart investors, the time to act could be now. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Laying the Foundation for Breakout Growth Momentum doesn’t just happen in crypto—it’s built. MAGACOINFINANCE is proving that with real traction across the metrics that matter: rising wallet growth, genuine community engagement, and consistent delivery on development milestones. Instead of chasing trends, MAGACOINFINANCE is setting itself apart by creating something few early-stage tokens manage: sustainability and structured expansion. The early adopters who spot it now could be positioning themselves for one of the biggest upside windows of the next cycle. Other Assets on the Move: Optimism, Arbitrum, Sei, and Litecoin Optimism continues to lead the Ethereum Layer-2 scaling race, drawing developers seeking fast, low-cost smart contract execution. Arbitrum remains dominant among Ethereum’s Layer-2 networks, pushing user adoption higher with innovative dApp ecosystems and low transaction costs. Sei is emerging as a performance-driven blockchain optimized for trading platforms and decentralized finance apps, offering speed without congestion. Litecoin maintains its legacy as a low-cost, high-speed peer-to-peer payment option—still used by millions globally for simple transfers. All are strong players—but none have the pure early-stage momentum that MAGACOINFINANCE currently commands. Conclusion The next wave of wealth in crypto won’t just be built by holding yesterday’s winners. It will come from spotting the assets quietly building their foundations today. Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP remain the giants. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is the rising star offering the rare chance to get in before the next major run.

The company intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Solana (SOL) tokens, as part of its strategy to build a Solana-focused treasury. ​ Moreover, as proof of its commitment to a treasury strategy centered on Solana , the company has invested $48.2 million. Under new leadership, the company has adopted a treasury policy centered around Solana . The board approved this policy on April 4, 2025, authorizing the long-term accumulation of SOL. ​ DeFi Development to cope with the current trend of purchasing SOL The former commercial real estate lending tech platform, DeFi Development, disclosed in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will invest the funds in general corporate purposes – potentially including the purchase of Solana. DeFi Development intends to offer and sell various securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities (which could be issued in one or more series and maybe senior or subordinated), warrants to purchase shares of common stock, preferred stock, or debt securities, units containing any of these securities, and rights to buy shares, preferred stock, debt securities, or units. Moreover, in order to generate staking rewards, DeFi Development intends to run validators on the Solana blockchain, having already purchased about $48.2 million worth of SOL. SOL Strategies , a publicly traded company led by CEO Leah Wald, a co-founder of digital asset advisory Valkyrie Investments, is leading the move. DeFi Development implemented a treasury strategy focused on Solana as part of its new course. Along with the $1 billion shelf registration, the firm also submitted a registration application for 1.24 million shares on behalf of early investors, such as Arrington Capital, Payward (Kraken’s parent company), and Pantera Capital. Notably, this results from the company’s recent trend of purchasing SOL for their balance sheets more frequently to give TradFi investors exposure to the token, taking a cue from Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin purchasing strategy. The company’s active participation in Solana’s network through validator operations and staking could influence both the token’s price and its adoption within the decentralized finance space. DeFi Development undergoes a significant leadership change DeFi Development also marked another milestone when the company recently revealed that it had obtained a convertible note facility worth up to $500 million to increase its investments in the Solana network. The new product from DeFi Development follows a major leadership change that occurred earlier this month. Joseph Onorati, a former Kraken executive, became the new chairman and CEO, and Parker White, another former Kraken engineer, was appointed chief investment officer and chief operating officer. Furthermore, the business appointed John Han, a former executive from Binance and Kraken, as its chief financial officer. Following the leadership change, DeFi Development Corp.’s stock surged more than 970%, increasing by about 4% to $54 per share in Friday’s after-hours trading.

This One Is Priced to Surge Over 1100% on Release,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/best-crypto-to-buy-now-for-roi-this-one-is-priced-to-surge-over-1100-on-release/,"In a market defined by momentum and timing, the smartest plays often come from those who spot potential before the breakout. With many top cryptocurrencies already seeing sizable runs, attention is turning to new contenders that combine strong fundamentals with growth-ready pricing. One of the standout names in this bracket is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)—a decentralized finance protocol that’s catching early investor attention for all the right reasons. At just $0.025, MUTM isn’t just affordable—it’s positioned to generate real ROI, with analysts projecting an over 1100% surge once it hits exchanges. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) What makes Mutuum Finance more than just another presale token is the project’s architecture. It’s built around a decentralized, non-custodial system that allows users to lend or borrow assets directly on-chain. Users contribute digital assets, receive mtTokens in return, and those mtTokens reflect not only their share of the pool but also accumulate interest as activity on the protocol increases. The tokenomics are built to favor long-term value over quick hype. Mutuum directs part of the revenue generated by its protocol activity toward buying MUTM tokens directly from the open market. These tokens are then redistributed to active participants, especially mtToken holders—those who supply liquidity and remain engaged in the ecosystem. This approach not only maintains consistent demand for the token but also keeps user rewards aligned with actual protocol usage. Mutuum’s presale isn’t just raising funds—it’s creating a structured entry point for new participants. With over 420 million tokens sold and more than $7 million raised, investor confidence is already on full display. But here’s where it gets interesting: the current presale price of $0.025 is expected to rise significantly as the token lists publicly. A 1100% surge from $0.025 would place MUTM around $0.30—a target that’s already being considered conservative given the protocol’s design and upcoming rollout. For a practical example: a $1,200 investment today secures 48,000 MUTM tokens. When the price reaches $0.30 post-launch, that same position would be worth $14,400. It’s not wishful thinking—it’s based on traction already seen in the presale and Mutuum’s growing community of close to 9,000 holders. Beyond speculative gains, Mutuum is laying out a real roadmap for DeFi functionality. One of its core components is an overcollateralized stablecoin, which is being designed to help users unlock liquidity without needing to sell their underlying crypto assets. This stablecoin will be issued against on-chain collateral and managed through smart contracts—bringing more stability and transparency to DeFi lending. In addition, transactions and protocol activity are executed entirely through smart contracts, with CertiK currently auditing the platform to ensure security and reliability before launch. That’s another layer of confidence for long-term participants and potential institutional interest down the line. With each new presale phase, the price of MUTM increases—and nearly half of the current phase is already sold out. Once this phase ends, the price will jump, reducing the upside for those who delay. Given that the protocol is structured around real yield, community incentives, and upcoming exchange listings, demand is expected to spike rapidly. To further encourage early adoption, the team has also rolled out a $100,000 giveaway, rewarding top participants and community members. It’s another signal that Mutuum isn’t just looking to raise capital—it’s actively rewarding early believers. In a space crowded with hype-driven plays and recycled roadmaps, Mutuum Finance stands out for its clarity of purpose and real potential for long-term returns. With a structured revenue system, real DeFi tools, and a presale price that still sits far below projected post-listing values, MUTM is quickly becoming one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in now—especially for those targeting ROI in 2025 and beyond. Whether you’re an experienced cryptocurrency investor or just starting to explore promising opportunities, this is a moment worth paying close attention to. Because by the time the listings go live, this opportunity might already be history.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) jumped above $95,000 for the first time in over a month, while the market cap of all Solana (SOL) meme coins jumped to over $10 billion. This article explains why Pi Network ( PI ), Ripple ( XRP ), and Sui ( SUI ) are the top cryptocurrencies to watch this week. Sui token unlock could disrupt the rally Sui, a top layer-1 network, was one of the top-performing coins in the crypto industry as it jumped to $3.8, its highest level since Feb. 1, and up by 110% from its lowest level this month. It rallied as top meme coins in its ecosystem surged, resulting in a 60% increase in weekly DEX volume. Protocols in its platform handled over $3.43 billion in volume in the last 7 days, bringing the monthly transactions to over $11 billion. Sui’s surge may be disrupted by a big token unlock scheduled for Thursday. The network will release tokens worth $120 million. Token unlocks lead to dilution, often affecting a coin’s performance. The daily chart also shows that the SUI price has become overbought as the Relative Strength Index has moved to 77. Therefore, the coin is likely to retreat and retest the key support at $2.8150, the neckline of the double-bottom pattern at $2.

The chart below shows that the XRP price was trading at $2.17 on Sunday, a notable level for two reasons. First, it is along the 50-day Exponential Moving Average, which has provided substantial resistance in the past few months. Second, the price is along the descending trendline connecting the highest levels since January 16. This trendline is the upper side of the descending triangle, whose lower side is at $1.9437. A descending triangle is a popular bearish chart pattern. Therefore, the coin will need to rise above the slanted trendline and the 50-day moving average to invalidate the bearish outlook of the triangle.

It has remained at $0.6350 in the past few weeks, and it did not participate in last week’s crypto recovery. Therefore, this consolidation may be calm before the storm since all Pi needs is a minor catalyst, and its price will go parabolic. A potential catalyst will be an exchange listing by one or more tier-one companies. HTX, a top exchange that is advised by Justin Sun, has been sending hints that it will list it soon. For example, Pi Network has appeared on several X posts, including the one shown below and this one.

The ongoing trade tensions between the US and China, combined with weak economic indicators, have created a challenging environment for risk assets like crypto. Related Reading: Ethereum Flips Key Resistance Into Support – Can Bulls Reclaim $2,000 Level? However, despite these headwinds, Ethereum has shown signs of resilience. Some analysts interpret the recent surge in ETH price as a positive shift that could lead to sustained upward momentum if key resistance levels are breached. Top analyst Daan recently shared insights on the ETH/BTC chart, highlighting that Ethereum had a good start last week, showing notable strength relative to Bitcoin. This move immediately pulled a broad range of altcoins higher, signaling growing risk appetite among investors. Daan emphasizes that Ethereum’s ability to retake its local range is an encouraging development, and a continued push could set the stage for a broader recovery across the altcoin sector. Ethereum Builds Momentum Ethereum is beginning to show early signs of a bullish structure forming on the lower time frames, giving hope to investors after weeks of uncertainty. Bulls are steadily working to reclaim higher resistance levels, although selling pressure remains a real threat. The battle for control is intensifying, with analysts split between two scenarios: a massive breakout toward much higher targets or a failed breakout that could send ETH below the critical $1,300 support zone. Daan shared a technical view suggesting that Ethereum had a strong start last week, regaining strength relative to Bitcoin. This move was significant because it immediately triggered strength across many altcoins, a classic signal that sentiment could be shifting across the broader crypto market. Daan explains that Ethereum has retaken its local range, a critical development. The next objective for bulls is to push ETH toward the range high and reclaim the 4-hour 200 MA and EMA. Accomplishing this would mark the beginning of a potential higher timeframe reversal, turning the tide back in favor of buyers. Daan also highlights that if ETH can continue to build momentum from here, it could ignite another strong altcoin rally, amplifying the impact across the entire market.

Price Levels To Watch Ethereum is currently trading at $1,800 after spending several hours ranging tightly between $1,850 and $1,725. Despite the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, ETH has managed to maintain short-term strength by holding above the 4-hour 200 MA and EMA, two critical technical indicators that have acted as dynamic support throughout the recent price action. The consolidation within this range signals that bulls are defending key levels effectively, but they still need a catalyst to trigger the next significant move. Holding above the 4-hour 200 MA and EMA suggests that momentum remains in favor of buyers for now, and any push above $1,850 could open the door for a larger rally. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rally Lacks On-Chain Support – Analyst Warns Of Vanishing Network Activity However, global tensions and weakening economic indicators continue to weigh on sentiment, making next week crucial for clarity. If broader markets stabilize or Bitcoin continues its push toward new highs, Ethereum could benefit and extend its recovery. On the other hand, a failure to hold above $1,725 would expose ETH to renewed selling pressure and a potential retest of lower demand zones. For now, bulls remain in control, but vigilance is key as Ethereum approaches a pivotal moment.

As Bitcoin (BTC) continues strengthening, Solana (SOL) accelerates development, and XRP builds on its strong payment narrative, one new project is earning critical early attention: MAGACOINFINANCE . While the majors dominate today’s headlines, those who understand market cycles know the next big stories often start quieter—and MAGACOINFINANCE is now firmly in that conversation. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quietly Shaping Into a Major 2025 Contender The real opportunities come before the noise—and MAGACOINFINANCE is positioning itself with the same early traction signals that marked previous breakout cycles. Through steady wallet growth, expanding community engagement, and strong early positioning, the project is carving a path that mirrors the early days of Bitcoin and Solana: quiet belief, organic expansion, and strategic patience. Those acting early are finding themselves in a rare phase that most investors only wish they had spotted with other giants before they took off. Other Major Movers: TRX, ADA, INJ, and LINK TRON (TRX) continues leading in decentralized app deployment across emerging economies. Cardano (ADA) remains committed to peer-reviewed blockchain innovation and environmental sustainability. Injective (INJ) is powering advanced decentralized finance protocols and native trading infrastructure. Chainlink (LINK) is still the leading solution for integrating real-world data into decentralized smart contracts. These are strong projects—but MAGACOINFINANCE is operating where few assets are: before widespread recognition, with the full weight of early positioning still intact. Final Word Big gains in crypto are rarely captured by following the crowd—they’re captured by spotting strength before it becomes obvious. While Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP continue commanding attention, MAGACOINFINANCE is offering the kind of early-stage window that turns small strategic entries into major success stories.

Blockstream co-founder and CEO Adam Back recently highlighted the decisive role played by such firms as Strategy, who are “front-running” inevitable change. In Back’s words, Bitcoin treasury firms are riding on a “logical and sustainable arbitrage” between future Bitcoin dominance and current fiat-based financial systems. Back emphasized that this method is a scalable $100–$200 trillion trade opportunity, which can accommodate even the world’s biggest businesses. Global Bitcoin Adoption Accelerates Back continued to suggest that Bitcoin’s ongoing capability to surpass fiat inflation on four-year cycles continues as a core driving factor of hyperbitcoinization. Bitcoin’s limited supply and stable monetary policy continue to draw institutional and governmental attention worldwide. Suggesting broader backing, Back’s comments came shortly after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a national Bitcoin reserve. The reserve, sourced from Bitcoin forfeited during criminal proceedings, is a significant step toward formal government adoption of BTC. Strategy and Metaplanet on the Cutting Edge Strategy, the largest corporate owner of Bitcoin in its own description, has shown the effectiveness of a Bitcoin-focused treasury strategy . Strategy’s Bitcoin position has posted over $5.1 billion in profits since the beginning of 2025, as reported by company co-founder Michael Saylor. In Asia, Japan’s Metaplanet, or as it is also called, “Asia’s MicroStrategy,” recently passed 5,000 BTC in holdings. Metaplanet is to raise its holdings to 21,000 BTC by 2026, again showing the pace of growth in corporate Bitcoin treasuries. Regulatory Winds Blowing in Bitcoin’s Favor The regulatory environment is also changing to support Bitcoin adoption. The US Federal Reserve recently revoked its 2022 guidance warning banks away from dealing with cryptocurrencies. “Banks can now openly begin to support Bitcoin,” stated Michael Saylor, marking the beginning of a new era of banking sector engagement and predicting greater adoption of Bitcoin by the general financial community.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-27 16:19:47
43871376,https://thecryptobasic.com/?p=122950,1745770853,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png,Here is How High Shiba Inu Can Reach if Total Crypto Market Cap Reaches $30T,https://thecryptobasic.com/2025/04/27/here-is-how-high-shiba-inu-can-reach-if-total-crypto-market-cap-reaches-30t/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=here-is-how-high-shiba-inu-can-reach-if-total-crypto-market-cap-reaches-30t,"If the global crypto market cap rises to $30 trillion and Shiba Inu continues to maintain its 0.29% dominance, its price will also grow proportionally. Last week, the broader crypto market staged a relief rally after the U.S. dollar index (DXY) crashed to a three-year low. This decline helped to position cryptos as a store of value, similar to precious metal gold. Following the DXY plunge, Bitcoin's price surged above $95,000, pushing the global crypto market cap above $3 trillion. Despite Bitcoin’s drop below the $95,000 mark, the total crypto valuation still stands close to the $3 trillion milestone. At press time, the total crypto valuation was $2.97 trillion, representing an increase of 0.87% over the past 24 hours. While the total crypto market cap is below expectations, many have remained optimistic that the valuation would rise to unprecedented levels during a major bull run. Some experts project that the total crypto valuation will soar to $5 trillion—$30 trillion in the future, representing an up to tenfold increase from the current value. If the total valuation reaches a lofty target of $30 trillion, all crypto assets, including Shiba Inu, are expected to experience huge spikes. SHIB Valuation and Price If Total Crypto Market Cap Hits $5T, $10T, $15T, $20T, or $30T At the moment, Shiba Inu’s market cap of $8.6 billion accounts for approximately 0.29% of the total crypto valuation of $2.97 trillion. This indicates that Shiba Inu has a market dominance of 0.29%, which is relatively low compared to Bitcoin’s current standing of 63.26%.Assuming Shiba Inu’s market share remains constant and the total crypto valuation soars to a peak of $30 trillion, SHIB would also see a proportional lift. Therefore, we estimated SHIB’s valuation if the total crypto market cap rose from its current value to $30 trillion. We did this by multiplying SHIB’s current dominance of 0.29% by the projected crypto market cap. That said, should the total crypto market cap rise to $5 trillion, $10 trillion, $15 trillion, $20 trillion, or $30 trillion, Shiba Inu’s valuation would soar to $14.5 billion, $29 billion, $43.5 billion, $58 billion, or $87 billion, respectively. At a valuation of $14.5 billion, 1 SHIB token would be worth $0.00002460, assuming Shiba Inu’s circulating supply remains stable. Additionally, reaching the projected market cap of $29 billion, $43.5 billion, $58 billion, or $87 billion would push SHIB’s price to $0.00004921, $0.00007382, $0.00009843, or $0.0001476, respectively, under the same condition. These prices mark potential surges of 68%, 237%, 436%, 574%, or 911% from the current price of $0.00001459. When Can SHIB Reach These Targets? Changelly experts suggest that the projected prices are within Shiba Inu's reach. According to a recent analysis, they expect Shiba Inu to clinch the $0.00002460 target by January 2026, with SHIB projected to rise to an average target of $0.0000314. Experts at Changelly forecast that the $0.00004921 target will materialize the following year, specifically by July 2027. Changelly also expects SHIB’s price to reach $0.00007382 a year later by July 2028. While Changelly set April 2029 as the potential timeline for SHIB’s rise to the $0.00009843 mark, it believes the token would clinch the $0.0001476 target by May 2030, five years from now.",Market|Latest Shiba Inu (SHIB) News Today|Shiba Inu Price Prediction,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-04-27 16:20:53

Right now, four names are gaining serious attention: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM , XRP , Solana , and Bitcoin . Each is flashing different signals, but together they represent a powerful trend: assets preparing to break past previous ceilings and enter a new growth phase. Smart investors are already positioning ahead of the next leg higher. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Building the Energy for a Major Breakout It’s rare to find a project still under the radar but showing all the right signals. MAGACOINFINANCE is one of those rare cases. Real wallet growth is happening daily. Community conversations are turning from speculative to strategic. Developer communication is clear, consistent, and grounded in actual delivery—not just promises. Early-stage cycles reward those who move before the crowd—and MAGACOINFINANCE is steadily gaining the kind of early attention that historically precedes major market moves. This is not about chasing short-term pumps. It’s about identifying the structural foundations that build long-term wealth. Why Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP Are Still Central to the New Wave Bitcoin continues to cement itself as a macroeconomic safe-haven. Solana is once again the platform of choice for developers seeking speed, efficiency, and scalability. XRP has overcome its regulatory hurdles and is now thriving as an institutional-grade asset for cross-border payments and financial integration. All three assets offer stability and proven strength—but MAGACOINFINANCE offers something few assets can match: raw, early-stage growth potential still unfolding. Also Moving Fast: Polygon, Sei, and Aptos Polygon remains Ethereum’s most trusted Layer-2 solution. Its scaling capabilities have made it the preferred choice for countless major brands entering Web3. Sei is positioning itself as a next-gen blockchain focused on trading efficiency. Its infrastructure is designed for high-frequency financial applications and is gaining developer momentum quickly. Aptos continues to innovate on user experience and transaction speed, setting new benchmarks for modern Layer-1 blockchains looking to dominate decentralized finance and social applications. While each of these projects brings serious potential, MAGACOINFINANCE still sits in the discovery phase—the stage where the biggest gains are often made. Conclusion New highs are rarely obvious until they’re already behind us. Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP are setting up for strong performance—but MAGACOINFINANCE.COM may be the project offering the rare chance to get in before the acceleration phase truly begins. The groundwork is being laid. The momentum is building. The next big moves could already be forming.

Regardless, it has gone a long way in that direction as SOL boosters promised. Over the last year, Bitcoin has outpaced Solana gains as SOL is going through a consolidation period.

In the last 24 hours, BNB has climbed from $597.93 to a promising high of $609.14, as the market anticipates it breaching $610. Can BNB Post a Breakout? However, according to CoinMarketCap data , BNB is still experiencing fluctuations and trades at $601.02, representing a 0.73% decline. The trading volume has also dropped by 7.08% to $1.45 billion. BNB price analysis signaled that it could soar to $620 if it succeeds in breaching the $609 resistance. The coin had successfully defended the $596 support level and looked set to try for new heights. However, the market pullback could have led to a correction. Meanwhile, technical indicators signal that BNB is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern after experiencing rejection at $610. BNB’s next move might depend on whether it experiences a breakout or breakdown. As it stands, the looming Lorentz upgrade, expected to occur on April 29, might become the catalyst for BNB’s further climb. How Lorentz Will Improve BNB Chain The Lorentz upgrade is one of three scheduled for 2025. The enhancements aim to make Binance Smart Chain (BSC) one of the fastest in crypto. When completed, Lorentz will reduce the block time by half, from three to 1.5 seconds. This will reduce latency and speed up transaction confirmation in the ecosystem. The increased speed will also improve the response time of decentralized applications (dApps) on the network. According to the schedule, BSC developers will proceed with the other upgrade after Lorentz, the Maxwell upgrade, which has been slated to launch in June 2025. The Maxwell upgrade hopes to reduce block times to 0.75 seconds further, boosting the network’s transaction speed. BSC Aims to Challenge Solana and Ethereum Dominance BSC developers aim to make the network a practical alternative to others like Solana and Ethereum. Solana, known for its high throughput and low transaction fees, has become the home of memecoins. On the other hand, Ethereum lags in speed and has high transaction costs. Users look forward to the Lorentz upgrade and the effect it could have on BNB’s price.

Overview Cryptocurrency Hedera Hashgraph Ticker HBAR Current Price $ 0.1866 Market Cap $7.88B Trading Volume (24Hr) $197.41M Circulating Supply 50B HBAR All-time High $0.5701 on Sep 16, 2021 All-time Low $0.01001 on Jan 03, 2020 24-hour High $0.194 24-hour Low $0.1862 HBAR price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 6.59% 50-day SMA $ 0.179729 200-day SMA $ 0.191475 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 61 (Greed) Green Days 15/30 (50%) Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) price analysis HBAR is consolidating within a tight range on the 4-hour chart indicating a balance between buyers and sellers The MACD is showing a weakening bullish momentum and the Balance of Power suggests slight selling pressure A breakout above $0.20 could signal bullish continuation while a drop below $0.18 may trigger further losses HBAR price analysis 1-day chart HBAR/USD chart. Image Source: Trading view Based on the 1-day chart on April 27, Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) exhibits a cautiously bullish tone despite recent volatility. The price currently trades around $0.185, hovering between the midline and upper band of the Bollinger Bands, suggesting that moderate upward momentum is possible if buying pressure sustains. The RSI at approximately 56 showcases improving bullish sentiment without reaching overbought conditions. However, the bearish daily candle signals that some profit-taking may occur. Overall, HBAR appears poised for a gradual recovery, but traders should remain alert for potential corrections if resistance near $0.195 remains strong and broader market conditions turn adverse. HBAR/USD 4-hour price chart HBAR/USD chart . Image Source: Tradingview Based on the 4-hour chart, Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) displays a cautious consolidation phase. The price action is closely hugging the middle range of the Bollinger Bands, suggesting a balance between buyers and sellers. The MACD line remains above the signal line but shows signs of narrowing momentum, pointing to potential indecision. Meanwhile, the Balance of Power (BoP) indicator is slightly negative, hinting at mild selling pressure. Overall, HBAR appears to be preparing for its next directional move. A sustained break above $0.20 could ignite bullish momentum, while failure to hold $0.18 might open room for further downside. What can you expect from the HBAR price analysis next? HBAR displays cautious optimism across both the 1-day and 4-hour charts. On the daily timeframe, the price is consolidating with the RSI hovering near neutral, suggesting room for upward momentum if bullish pressure builds. The 4-hour chart reinforces this consolidation but reveals slightly weakening bullish signals with a flattening MACD and minor selling pressure from the Balance of Power. A decisive breakout above $0.20 could confirm a bullish shift in sentiment, leading to higher targets. However, failure to maintain support around $0.18 could expose HBAR to renewed downside risk, warranting cautious monitoring by market participants.

Hedera Hashgraph distinguishes itself with its Hashgraph consensus algorithm, which promises higher speed, security, and scalability than traditional blockchain technologies. This positions HBAR as a potentially innovative player in distributed ledger technology, catering to various applications, including smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). These notable features could spur HBAR to new highs in the coming months and years, making it a profitable investment tool. Will HBAR reach $1? Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $1 is possible but depends on several key factors, including market conditions, adoption rates, and overall crypto sentiment. HBAR has strong fundamentals with its fast, low-cost transactions and backing from major enterprises. If adoption grows within industries like DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise applications, demand for HBAR could push prices higher. However, competition from other layer-1 blockchains and regulatory factors may slow its growth. A bullish crypto cycle and wider institutional interest would be necessary for HBAR to reach $1. While achievable, sustained utility and investor confidence are crucial for long-term price appreciation. What will HBAR be worth in 2025? By 2025, HBAR is expected to be worth $0.34 How much will HBAR cost in 2030? By 2030, HBAR is expected to be worth $2.10 Can HBAR reach $20? HBAR reaching $20 would require an extraordinary market rally and widespread adoption, making it highly unlikely in the near future. For context, with HBAR’s current circulating supply of around 33 billion tokens, a $20 price would push its market capitalization to $660 billion, placing it among the largest cryptocurrencies, rivaling Bitcoin and Ethereum. Where to buy HBAR? Traders and investors can buy Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) on these CEXs: Binance, KuCoin, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, and others. Will HBAR reach $10? HBAR reaching $10 is highly unlikely, requiring a massive market cap increase. Predictions for 2030 estimate HBAR could reach between $2.23 and $2.65, making $10 an unrealistic target without extraordinary market changes. Will HBAR reach $100? Hederah Hashgraph (HBAR) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and would require exceptional growth, widespread adoption, and wild market speculation. Does HBAR have a good long-term future? HBAR has the potential for a good, long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $0.34 by 2025 and $0.50 by 2030. However, as with all meme coins, its future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support. Recent news/opinion on HBAR Nasdaq has applied to list an ETF holding Hedera’s HBAR token. This follows multiple filings by exchanges and asset managers seeking altcoin-based ETFs. The SEC must approve the listing before trading begins. In November, Canary Capital filed for its Canary HBAR ETF to provide investors with exposure to Hedera’s native currency. Hedera Hashgraph price prediction April 2025 The Hedera Hashgraph price prediction for April 2025 suggests a consistent projection, with potential prices ranging from a low of $0.1583, an average of around $0.1731, to a high of $0.1781.

This overlooked cryptocurrency might just outshine them both by summer 2025. Explore how this underdog is gaining traction and why it could become the next big name in the crypto world. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalisation Approaches the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $10 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits PEPE: A Deflationary Memecoin Tribute on the Ethereum Blockchain PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum as a homage to the Pepe the Frog internet meme created by Matt Furie. The project seeks to capitalize on the popularity of meme coins like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, aiming to establish itself among the top meme-based cryptocurrencies. PEPE appeals to the cryptocurrency community by adopting a no-tax policy and being transparent about its lack of utility, maintaining simplicity as a pure memecoin. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced a significant surge, with its market capitalization reaching a peak of $1.6 billion. This rapid growth resulted in substantial gains for early holders and attracted a community of enthusiasts. The surge contributed to what some have called a “memecoin season,” prompting other memecoins to experience dramatic fluctuations. The PEPE roadmap includes phases focusing on listings on CoinMarketCap, centralized exchanges, and aiming for “tier 1” exchange listings accompanied by a “meme takeover.” The coin’s recent performance has drawn attention in the current market cycle, reflecting ongoing interest in memecoin phenomena within the cryptocurrency space. Shiba Inu (SHIB): An Ethereum-Based Memecoin with Expanding Utilities Shiba Inu (SHIB) is a cryptocurrency inspired by Dogecoin. It was launched in August 2020 by an anonymous developer known as Ryoshi. SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, which allows it to be compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem. It started with one quadrillion tokens, and half of these were sent to Vitalik Buterin, the co-creator of Ethereum, to build trust. Buterin donated a large portion of his SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and burned 40% of the total supply, reducing the number of SHIB in circulation. SHIB’s integration with Ethereum enables the development of applications like ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange. There are plans for a future NFT platform and a governance system based on a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). These developments could increase SHIB’s utility in the crypto space. In the current market cycle, SHIB’s attractiveness depends on factors like community support and technological advancements. Its position on the Ethereum blockchain may offer advantages over other memecoins that lack such compatibility. Conclusion PEPE and SHIB have shown impressive gains, but XYZVerse (XYZ) aims to surpass them by uniting sports fans in a memecoin targeting 20,000% growth by 2025.

Lazarus, the notorious state-sponsored North Korean syndicate responsible for some of the biggest hacking operations in history, has managed to set up corporations in the states of New Mexico and New York, Reuters reports . Researchers at the cybersecurity firm Silent Push say the companies, called Blocknovas LLC and Softglide LLC, were set up using fake personas and addresses. The goal of the firms is to advertise fake jobs for crypto developers in an effort to infect job applicants’ wallets with malware once they respond. Says Kasey Best, director of threat intelligence at Silent Push, “This is a rare example of North Korean hackers actually managing to set up legal corporate entities in the U.S. in order to create corporate fronts used to attack unsuspecting job applicants… These attacks utilize fake personas offering job interviews, which lead to sophisticated malware deployments in order to compromise the cryptocurrency wallets of developers, and they also target the developers’ passwords and credentials which could be used to further attacks on legitimate businesses.” The FBI has not officially commented on the developments, but an official told Reuters that North Korean cyber operations are “perhaps one of the most advanced persistent threats” facing the US. For now, the FBI has seized the domain of Blocknovas. The Bureau’s warning reads , “This domain has been seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in accordance with a seizure warrant issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas as part of a law enforcement action against North Korean Cyber Actors who utilized this domain to deceive individuals with fake job postings and distribute malware.

Yet, when it comes to building real income quickly, BlockDAG is offering something most platforms simply cannot match. Thanks to its booming $219 million presale and a fresh limited-time price rollback, users have a rare chance to buy early and activate powerful cash rewards. Even better, just one referral who invests $5,000 could land you an instant $1,250 in cash rewards. Here’s exactly how you can tap into BlockDAG’s opportunity without needing a huge network. Buying BDAG: The First Step to Unlocking Massive Rewards Before referring others and earning from BlockDAG , the first step is securing your own BDAG tokens. Buying BDAG immediately qualifies you to participate in the lucrative referral program that pays 25% cash rewards. BlockDAG’s current presale is in batch 27, with over 19.3 billion coins already sold and $219 million raised. Although the listed price is $0.0248, a limited-time offer rolls it back to just $0.0025, presenting a perfect opportunity for those seeking the best place to buy crypto with high upside potential. Purchasing is simple. Users can visit blockdag.network, connect a crypto wallet like MetaMask, fund it with ETH, BNB, or USDT, and purchase with as little as $15. However, serious investors often recognize the value of making larger buys during early-stage rollbacks. With the mainnet set to launch in 2025 and a return on investment (ROI) of 2,380% recorded since batch 1, now is the ideal time to make a move. By buying BDAG yourself, you not only position yourself for potential future gains but also activate the referral link needed to start earning immediately. Why One Serious Crypto Investor Is All You Need Many people mistakenly believe that building a passive income stream through referrals requires a large, complicated network. BlockDAG flips that assumption completely. Thanks to its generous 25% cash reward system, even one committed buyer can change everything. Targeting individuals who are already crypto-savvy and comfortable with $5,000 or more in investments is the key strategy. These are the same people who recognize early-stage crypto opportunities and have likely been seeking the best place to buy crypto that offers real upside. Approaching crypto enthusiasts, investors active in DeFi, or anyone following high-growth Layer 1 projects can make recruiting easier and far more rewarding. Focus on sharing the facts: BlockDAG’s DAG-powered, Proof-of-Work hybrid structure processes 10 blocks per second, aiming for over 100, with scalability that fits the needs of DeFi and dApps alike. Combined with a massive community of over 800,000 miners already engaged, credibility and momentum are on BlockDAG’s side. Rather than spending time chasing dozens of small buyers, targeting one serious investor could land you an immediate $1,250 cash reward with minimal effort. This approach is both smarter and faster. The Math Behind Earning $1,250 Instantly The math behind BlockDAG’s referral program is straightforward and incredibly appealing. Here’s how it works: Imagine referring just one person who buys $5,000 worth of BDAG tokens. With BlockDAG’s 25% cash reward, you instantly earn: $5,000 × 25% = $1,250 cash It’s that simple. Meanwhile, your referral earns 5% cash back, receiving $250 immediately after their purchase, creating a win-win situation. By focusing on a single serious buyer rather than chasing after smaller purchases, the path to significant cash rewards becomes much clearer. Considering the limited rollback price of $0.0025 and the already achieved 2,380% ROI since batch 1, urgency is critical. Every day, the presale moves closer to its conclusion, and once the price rises or sells out, the window to buy low and refer high-value investors closes. For anyone searching for the best place to buy crypto with real, measurable rewards beyond speculative gains, BlockDAG currently stands out as one of the most compelling options available. Final Take BlockDAG is showing the crypto world that building wealth through referrals doesn’t have to be complicated or require massive audiences. With the opportunity to earn $1,250 from a single $5,000 buyer, the rewards speak for themselves. The current presale, having raised $219 million with over 19.3 billion coins sold, offers a rare entry point thanks to its limited-time price rollback to $0.0025. For those looking for the best place to buy crypto, BlockDAG delivers a combination of high upside, credibility, and instant earning potential that few others can match. Take action now before the window closes, and make your first $1,250 cash reward a reality.

The Dogecoin price currently stands at $0.1862, with a modest 2% increase. Following a recent Death Cross, the Dogecoin price appears to be on the verge of a reversal with its new Golden Cross formation. Investors are shifting away from the uncertain traditional meme coins, seeking fresh opportunities in more promising pastures. FloppyPepe (FPPE) , at $0.0000002 , fuses cutting-edge AI with raw community power, setting its sights on returns that seasoned giants would kill for. Following a $1 million private sale that took less than 24 hours and a presale already surpassing $1.5 million, investors are rushing in. Dogecoin (DOGE) Breaks Free: Golden Cross Fuels New Bull Run Dogecoin (DOGE) formed a rare Golden Cross on its hourly chart today, April 26, 2025, signaling potential bullish momentum. The 50-hour simple moving average (SMA) crossed above the 200-hour SMA, a technical indicator often viewed as a positive signal for price action. Following this Golden Cross formation, Dogecoin (DOGE) experienced a surge, reaching approximately $0.1923 before a slight correction. The Dogecoin price is reclaiming higher ground in the meme coin arena. However, despite this Golden Cross signal, the Dogecoin price daily chart still reflects a bearish structure. The 50-day SMA remains below the 200-day SMA in a death cross, suggesting that longer-term pressures may persist. According to Tardigrade, an analyst on X, the Dogecoin price could be charging toward $0.25 sooner than most expect. FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Roadmap: Expanding, Earning, And Going Big While the Dogecoin price flashes a rare Golden Cross and bullish momentum builds, some investors are setting their sights on a fresh rival: FloppyPepe (FPPE) . Backed by a strong, forward-driven roadmap, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is already gaining serious traction. This AI meme coin has undergone a comprehensive smart contract audit by SolidProof, launched a beta version of its Meme-o-Matic AI agent, and secured a listing on CoinMarketCap—all before its presale concludes. Next up, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) is going bigger: Expansion across Binance Smart Chain and Solana Launching a full-scale Discord community Securing a Tier 1 exchange listing Rolling out smart tokenomics to reward diamond hands and fund wildlife conservation Meme Creation Gets An Upgrade With FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) AI-Driven Powerhouse FloppyPepe (FPPE) is making waves with its powerhouse tech stack.

Bulls have regained short-term control, pushing prices higher as optimism grows across the market. However, the environment remains far from risk-free, with volatility still elevated and macroeconomic conditions shifting rapidly amid ongoing global trade tensions. According to recent data from Glassnode, Bitcoin open interest has jumped 20% over the past 20 days. This surge suggests that traders are increasingly positioning for continued upside, but it also indicates that leverage is building across the market, which could amplify future price swings. As Bitcoin tests the upper end of its recent trading range, the coming days will be crucial. A successful push toward the $100K mark could set the stage for a fresh rally into uncharted territory, while failure to hold support would expose BTC to another round of consolidation or correction. Bitcoin Tests Critical Levels As Volatility Rises Bitcoin has been on a wild ride since November 2024, when Donald Trump won the US Presidential election and global markets reacted with heightened volatility. Macroeconomic tensions, trade conflicts, and unstable financial conditions have created an unpredictable environment, and Bitcoin has been no exception. However, despite the turbulence, bulls have recently regained short-term control. After pushing decisively above the $89,000 resistance, a key level that had capped Bitcoin’s upside for weeks, BTC is now testing crucial zones just below the $100,000 mark. This level represents a psychological barrier for the market and a potential gateway to new all-time highs if bulls manage to break through with strength. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared insights on X , revealing that Bitcoin open interest has jumped 20% over the past 20 days, now topping $26 billion. This significant increase shows that traders are aggressively positioning for future price movements. However, it also highlights growing leverage across the market, which can magnify both gains and losses in the short term. Leverage-driven rallies tend to be fragile, so while sentiment has shifted bullishly, risks remain high. The coming weeks will be crucial for Bitcoin as it either confirms this breakout or faces another round of intense volatility. BTC Weekly Close: Bulls Must Defend $90K Bitcoin is trading around $94,000 as the market approaches a crucial weekly close. After weeks of intense volatility and heavy selling pressure earlier this year, bulls have finally regained control. However, with global macroeconomic conditions still highly unstable, especially due to ongoing US-China trade tensions, caution remains necessary. For Bitcoin to maintain its bullish momentum, bulls must secure a weekly close above the $90,000 mark. This level now acts as a critical support zone, and closing above it would reinforce the idea that Bitcoin is building strength for a potential push toward new highs. Still, reclaiming the $100,000 level quickly is vital. A move above $100K would not only mark a major psychological breakthrough but also set the stage for a strong rally into uncharted territory. If Bitcoin stalls too long below $100K, uncertainty and rising market risks could invite renewed selling pressure. The coming days are key. Bulls have momentum on their side, but they must act fast to solidify the recovery and stay ahead of broader financial market instability. All eyes are now on Bitcoin’s performance as the new weekly candle approaches.

MUTM Has Utility, Revenue, and Room to 40x",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/best-crypto-to-buy-now-with-1-target-mutm-has-utility-revenue-and-room-to-40x/,"The post Best Crypto to Buy Now With $1 Target? MUTM Has Utility, Revenue, and Room to 40x appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News As the crypto market regains its footing, investors are already scanning for the next crypto to hit $1—not just based on hype, but on real fundamentals. One project quietly climbing the radar is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Still sitting at just $0.025, it’s gaining traction as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now for those focused on long-term growth and sustainable returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) MUTM isn’t a meme coin or a copycat—it’s the token powering a revenue-backed DeFi protocol designed to make lending and borrowing more efficient. With nearly $7 million raised in its ongoing presale and almost 9,000 wallets already on board, the market response speaks for itself. The token is currently in Phase 4 of an 11-phase presale, meaning that as each phase closes, the entry price rises. The next phase lifts the price to $0.03, making now the window to get in before that jump. When MUTM reaches even $1, a $500 investment today (20,000 tokens) would translate to $20,000. That’s the kind of setup that has investors paying attention—especially since analysts are calling it one of the few low-cap cryptos with 40x potential heading into 2025. Mutuum Finance allows users to lend and borrow crypto assets while retaining custody of their funds. When a user deposits, they receive mtTokens, which reflect their deposit and grow in value over time through earned interest. These tokens are flexible: they can be held, traded, or used in other DeFi ecosystems. This system creates a passive income loop for users without requiring them to exit their positions or constantly manage them. It’s one of the reasons Mutuum is seen as a long-term play rather than a short-term gamble. The protocol redirects part of its revenue to buy MUTM directly from the open market, and those tokens are then sent to active participants—especially mtToken holders. This creates organic demand and puts upward pressure on the token price, aligning incentives between the project and its users. As lending activity grows and more users engage with the platform, more revenue gets reinvested into the ecosystem, reinforcing the price over time. The idea that MUTM is the next crypto to hit $1 isn’t wishful thinking—it’s based on solid groundwork. The project is launching with working DeFi functionality, has committed to releasing a beta version of the platform alongside the token launch, and is lining up major exchange listings for post-launch liquidity and exposure. As the token begins trading on public markets, wider access could trigger a significant wave of demand. And because the tokenomics are structured to reward long-term engagement, new users are more likely to hold rather than sell, limiting sell pressure and strengthening price momentum. In crypto, the early entries always see the largest gains. The difference here is that MUTM has utility baked in, not promised later. For anyone seeking the best crypto to invest in now with both utility and upside, this is one of the clearest options on the table. With the presale still active at $0.025 and a clear path laid out for growth, MUTM stands out in a crowded field. For those looking to secure a position in the next breakout token, this might be the moment.

This DeFi Crypto Could Outperform SOL and AVAX in 2025,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/next-23x-token-this-defi-crypto-could-outperform-sol-and-avax-in-2025/,"The post Next 23x Token? This DeFi Crypto Could Outperform SOL and AVAX in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In a market where momentum often shifts fast and unpredictably, smart investors are increasingly focused on value-driven tokens with real fundamentals. While major players like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX) continue to dominate headlines, one low-cap DeFi project is quietly positioning itself for what some analysts believe could be a breakout 23x run in 2025. That project is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized platform blending practical yield strategies with early-stage affordability. Solana (SOL) Solana has built a strong reputation for scalability and low fees, often cited as one of Ethereum’s top challengers. With its efficient consensus mechanism and fast transaction speeds, Sol has attracted developers building everything from NFTs to DeFi apps. However, it’s no longer under the radar. Most of Solana’s speculative upside is now dependent on major adoption shifts or market-wide rallies—both of which are already priced in by many market participants. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche, a well-established player in the smart contract space, is known for its rapid transaction speeds and robust framework for supporting decentralized applications. It’s known for custom blockchain deployments and institutional partnerships. Still, AVAX’s price performance has somewhat lagged despite technical growth. The barrier for entry is now higher, and retail enthusiasm has cooled as other emerging protocols begin to steal the spotlight. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) —a project still priced at just $0.025, but built with a structure that many believe could outperform both SOL and AVAX in the months ahead. Unlike some early-stage cryptocurrencies that lean heavily on hype, Mutuum is anchored in real DeFi mechanics that promote usability, passive income, and transparency. Mutuum enables both lending and borrowing directly through smart contracts. Users who deposit supported assets receive mtTokens, which represent their claim in the protocol’s liquidity pools. These tokens are more than just placeholders—they accrue value as interest compounds, providing a consistent yield for depositors without requiring active management. This makes MUTM a strong candidate for those seeking passive income through cryptocurrency. The project also incorporates a built-in overcollateralized stablecoin, minted from supplied assets and aligned through algorithmic mechanisms. This allows users to remain liquid while keeping exposure to their core assets, a strategy that appeals to both retail users and crypto-native funds managing complex portfolios. MUTM is currently available at $0.025 during its presale, but the upcoming phase will raise the token price to $0.03. With a total of 11 presale stages, each step forward locks in higher valuations—rewarding early participation. Analysts watching early momentum have forecasted a 23x surge based on projected exchange listings, rising demand from mtToken staking, and the upcoming launch of Mutuum’s beta platform. A $1,000 investment today secures 40,000 MUTM tokens. When the token reaches $0.575—a conservative 23x from the current price—that portfolio could be worth $23,000. This makes it one of the best crypto investments right now for those looking for high ROI potential from a micro-cap position. What really sets MUTM apart is its protocol-level buy-and-redistribute system. Mutuum allocates a share of its protocol-generated revenue to buy MUTM tokens directly from the market. These tokens are then redistributed to active participants—particularly mtToken holders—who contribute to the platform’s growth. This approach not only adds consistent buy pressure but also encourages ecosystem engagement without introducing long-term token dilution. It’s a sustainable model that strengthens long-term value—something many larger-cap projects are still working to balance. While Solana and Avalanche remain important parts of the crypto infrastructure, their room for exponential growth may be limited in comparison to small-cap tokens that are still in the early stages of development and pricing. MUTM fits this mold, combining low entry cost, real utility, and built-in demand mechanisms that could trigger major upside in 2025. As market attention rotates toward undervalued assets with tangible benefits, Mutuum Finance might just be the next crypto to watch—and for those looking to invest in the next big DeFi breakout, this $0.025 token could be it.

While Bitcoin experienced sharp moves, XRP’s price action has remained relatively stable. As of now, XRP is trading around $2.20, with strong support forming between $2.17 and $2.23. Looking ahead to next week, several key economic events could cause short-term swings in the broader crypto market. On Wednesday, investors will closely watch the core PCE inflation report and GDP data, followed by jobless claims and manufacturing PMI on Thursday. Friday’s unemployment data will round out the week. Although this data can trigger intraday volatility, analysts believe it is unlikely to shift XRP’s long-term trend unless results differ significantly from forecasts. From a technical perspective, XRP remains within a broader trading range, despite recent lower highs and lower lows. Analysts suggest this movement still supports the idea of consolidation rather than a full downtrend. XRP might briefly dip toward $2.05, but a continuation to $2.35 or $2.40 appears more likely if current support levels hold. Volume for XRP remains relatively low, but its 84% correlation with Bitcoin means it may mirror BTC’s movements in the short term.

Breaking out of a critical dynamic resistance, it just marked a new one due to a rejection, and is now poised for a drop. Just like many other cryptos, Aero located support at $0.28 some weeks back and bounced off after four months of selling. After suffering major losses, a relief set in for the bulls, but they failed to overcome the critical falling trendline, serving as dynamic resistance since last December. Following a slight drop from this dynamic resistance, the $0.375 level produced support and the price remained calm throughout last week. The trading landscape changed this week as buying volume increased and the price surged steadily until it hit $0.66. An attempt to push above this level has proven abortive and is now looking weak at the moment. While this surge confirmed a breakout of the four-month resistance, we can expect a slight shift in the trend, although it currently looks poised for a drop due to exhaustion in buying. As shown on the daily chart, the recent candle formations are now becoming choppy due to a rejection. Technically, these rejections indicate signs of weakness in the market. Losing grip above $0.6 could facilitate a major retest of the resistance line as support before rising back. A further rollback could bring the bears back into action as the supply level increases, leading to a bull trap. AERO’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Due to a slight rejection at $0.66, we may see a retest at $0.47. A dip below the $0.375 support could bring us back to the monthly $0.282 low. If the price increases above the rejected level, we can expect a test at the $0.74 resistance. Higher levels to consider for a test are $1 and $1.2.

In an April 27 Truth Social post , Trump added that the focus of the purported tax cuts would be on individuals making less than $200,000 per year. The US President also said that the ""External Revenue Service"" — a reference to funding the federal government exclusively through import tariffs instead of the current model of collecting taxes through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) — is materializing. Eliminating the federal income tax would likely be a positive catalyst for asset prices, including cryptocurrencies, as the increase in disposable income should partially flow back into productive investments. However, this stimulative effect is not guaranteed. Source: Donald Trump Related: If Trump fired Powell, what would happen to crypto? Trump’s plan leaves analysts and markets doubting Trump previously floated the idea of eliminating the federal income tax in an October 2024 appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience, although Trump, who was on the campaign trail at the time, provided scant concrete details on the proposal. The US President suggested that replacing the federal income tax with revenue from import duties would return the US to a time of prosperity seen during the Gilded Age, in the 19th century, when the US did not have a permanent federal income tax. Research conducted by accounting automation company Dancing Numbers found that Trump's proposal could save the average American $134,809 in lifetime tax payments. Dancing Numbers added that the tax savings could be as much as $325,561 per American if other wage-based income taxes are also eliminated. On April 2, Trump signed an executive order imposing sweeping tariffs on all US trading partners, which included a 10% baseline tariff on all countries and different ""reciprocal"" tariff rates on countries with import duties on US goods. However, since that time, the Trump administration walked back its tariff policies several times, flip-flopping on tariff rates and when the tariff regime would fully take effect. The Trump administration's ever-changing rhetoric surrounding trade policies has heightened volatility in the US stock market, caused a rise in US bond yields , and has drawn widespread criticism from financial analysts who say the protectionist trade policies hurt capital markets while achieving little else.

When a coin moons out of nowhere and then crashes just as fast — it is rarely pure market magic. Cryptocurrency price manipulation is the dark art of bending the market to your will. It is when insiders or coordinated groups inflate or crash a coin’s price, not through real demand, but through smoke and mirrors. They might fake volume , spread hype, trigger fear, or pull sudden sell-offs — all to trap unsuspecting traders and walk away with the profits. In traditional finance , this kind of behavior gets you fined or jailed. But what about in the world of crypto? It often flies under the radar. With light regulations and heavy emotions in play, the digital asset market has become a playground for manipulators, especially where liquidity is low and oversight is weaker. Here’s the classic playbook: Manipulators create fake demand or fear The price spikes or crashes based on emotional reactions from other traders The manipulators sell or buy at the right moment The rest of the market suffers the consequences. The most common crypto market manipulation tactics Scammers don’t need magic — they just need market psychology and a few tricks. As the digital asset landscape expands, criminals have honed various crypto price manipulation tactics. Each tactic capitalizes on the market’s volatility and traders’ fear of missing out (FOMO). Let’s break down the most used: Pump-and-dump: This scheme starts with a coordinated group quietly buying a low-cap token. They then ignite hype through influencers , fake news or viral posts to drive the price up rapidly. As retail investors rush in, the group sells at the top — causing the price to crash. Latecomers are left holding devalued tokens, having bought into the illusion of explosive growth. Whale moves: Whales — wallets holding large amounts of crypto – can shift market trends with a single trade. Their massive buy or sell orders influence price direction and trigger emotional responses from smaller traders. Many follow the whale’s lead, thinking they know something others don’t, which compounds the volatility. Some whales use this effect strategically to buy low and sell high. Wash trading: This usually involves a single user who buys and sells the same token to themselves to artificially inflate trading volume. This creates a false sense of activity and demand, misleading investors into thinking the project is more legitimate or liquid than it really is. It’s especially common on unregulated exchanges and can help tokens climb rankings on tracking platforms. Spoofing and layering: In spoofing, manipulators place large fake orders to buy or sell without intending to execute them. This gives the illusion of strong market interest and influences price action. Layering uses multiple fake orders at different price levels to amplify the effect. Once real traders react, the fake orders are removed and the manipulator takes profit, leaving others chasing phantom momentum. Did you know? According to a 2022 study, 70% of transactions on unregulated crypto exchanges are wash trades — with some platforms seeing volumes as high as 80%. Behind the scenes: Advanced crypto price manipulation tactics Not all crypto price manipulation is obvious. Some of it is deeply technical — or done in silence. Beyond basic scams, cybercriminals use more complex tactics to manipulate and sway the market. Bots manipulating crypto prices: High-frequency trading bots can front-run trades , spoof orders, or simulate volume — all faster than any human. Insider trading in crypto: When someone trades on non-public info (like a token listing or partnership), it gives them an unfair edge. And yes — it happens. Oracle manipulation: Hackers sometimes exploit oracles — the tools that feed price data into decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Faking a price feed can drain liquidity pools or trick smart contracts. Did you know? In 2020, a hacker used a flash loan to manipulate an oracle on bZx, stealing millions in seconds. It was one of the first examples of oracle-based fraud. Why manipulation works: Psychology over logic In crypto, emotion moves faster than reason — and scammers know it. Even experienced traders fall for manipulation because it plays on powerful instincts. Because the market moves fast, decisions are often made in the heat of the moment — on gut feeling, not deep analysis. And manipulators are experts at pressing the right emotional buttons. Greed is the oldest trick in the book. Everyone wants to catch the next 100x gem, and scammers know how to dress up trash as treasure. A few flashy tweets, a celebrity shoutout and, suddenly, a random coin looks like the ticket to financial freedom. Fear is just as powerful. One big red candle can trigger a chain reaction of panic selling. Manipulators use this to buy back cheap, while everyone else scrambles to exit. FOMO is the final piece. When traders see others making big gains, logic goes out the window. Instead of researching, they ape in , hoping not to be left behind. These emotions are hardwired. They’re faster than logic, and in crypto, speed is everything. Manipulators don’t need to hack wallets or break code — they just hack human behavior. Stir up just the right storm of excitement or dread, and the market plays right into their hands. Did you know? The infamous Squid Game Token soared tens of thousands of percent before crashing to zero . It was a textbook rug pull — but the hype was too loud for many to resist. What crypto price manipulation does to the market One scam doesn’t just hurt victims — it damages the entire ecosystem. Crypto price manipulation doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Every fake pump, every engineered crash, every orchestrated scam chips away at the foundation of the entire crypto ecosystem: trust. When retail traders — especially newcomers — get caught in a pump-and-dump or a whale-induced panic, the damage runs deeper than a single bad trade. Many walk away for good, disillusioned and angry, taking their money and optimism with them. The promise of open, decentralized finance starts to look like just another casino — rigged and unforgiving. And it doesn’t stop there. High-profile cryptocurrency frauds and price manipulation scandals light up the radar of regulators worldwide. Each incident becomes a case study in why crypto “needs to be tamed.” That means stricter rules, more compliance hoops and an overall slowdown in innovation. The free-spirited, experimental energy that drives crypto forward starts to feel boxed in. Meanwhile, legit projects — those building real utility, transparency and long-term value — struggle to rise above the noise. Scam tokens dominate the charts. Shady influencers flood timelines. The signal gets buried under waves of hype and deception. In the end, crypto price manipulation doesn’t just hurt individual investors. It poisons the well for everyone — developers, communities and the future of the space itself. Did you know? The memecoin craze has pulled in not just investors — but celebrities, too. From hyped tokens to sudden rug pulls, in 2024, several celeb-backed crypto projects have gone off the rails , blurring the line between fame and fraud. How to protect yourself from crypto manipulation You can’t control the market — but you can avoid its traps. Here are practical steps to avoid falling for crypto scams and manipulation: DYOR (Do Your Own Research): Don’t rely on TikTok tips or Telegram groups. Look into the token’s team, roadmap, use case and trading history. Watch trading volume: Sudden spikes or weirdly low volume can signal wash trading or a setup for manipulation. Monitor whale activity: Use tools like Whale Alert or blockchain explorers to spot big wallet movements. Use trusted platforms: Stick to exchanges that actively monitor for illegal crypto trading tactics like spoofing and wash trading. Keep learning: Stay up to date on the latest tactics and red flags. Knowledge is your best defense. The push for safer crypto markets The good news? The crypto world is fighting back. The crypto universe might still feel like the digital frontier, but it is no longer a lawless land. Across the ecosystem, the good guys — builders, platforms and policymakers — are stepping in to make the space more transparent, resilient and secure for users. Crypto exchanges are starting to unleash AI-powered surveillance tools designed to spot shady behavior in real time. Wash trading? Spoofing? Pump-and-dump groups? These algorithms are already trained to catch the tricks before they catch you. On the DeFi side, protocols are stepping up with on-chain governance and transparency upgrades. Communities can now vote on key actions, track wallet movements, and call out suspicious patterns — all out in the open. And regulators? They are finally moving from the sidelines to the rulebook. New legislation is targeting insider trading, fake promotions and market abuse, bringing long-overdue accountability to crypto’s fast lanes. Is the system foolproof yet? Far from it. But every smart contract, policy update and AI model pushing back against manipulation is a win for the space. So, if crypto scams thrive in the dark, knowledge is your flashlight. If a token’s mooning with no clear reason, pause. If something does not feel right, it probably is not. Trust your gut, not the hype. Because in the end, staying informed is your best defense — and your smartest investment.",Crypto price manipulation,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-04-27 17:27:00

While the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has yet to confirm a final approval, the proposed public offering date is now in black and white, raising hopes—and eyebrows—across the crypto market. $XRP ETF APPROVED. https://t.co/JbJ5y39ky1 — Uphold (@UpholdInc) April 27, 2025 The buzz began when industry sources reported on a U.S. SEC document showing ProShares’ registration statement under the Investment Company Act with an “approximate date of public offering” set for April 30. While not yet a formal green light, this is the clearest signal yet that an XRP ETF is imminent. XRP Price and Market Sentiment The XRP price surged on the news, outperforming most altcoins over the weekend. Market analysts say that the ETF speculation aligns with strong technical setups forming across the crypto landscape, particularly falling wedge breakouts, a classic bullish pattern. The Bigger Picture While questions remain—such as why only ProShares has surfaced with a proposed launch date, and where BlackRock, Fidelity, and others stand—most experts agree this is a pivotal moment for crypto.

SHIB is now worth $0.000013, while DOGE is worth approximately $0.17. As popular as the two coins are, both of them are finding it difficult to generate significant returns in the short term. That is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters the picture, a DeFi coin that is worth $0.025. The project, in Phase 4 of its presale, has over $7.2 million in funding from more than 9100 investors. Trading at $0.025 now, the token, MUTM will increase by 20% in the next Phase 5 to $0.03. Analysts put an estimated 19,000% increase for MUTM in 2025, reaching as much as $4.75 from its current value. This projection is supported by the platform’s innovative lending mechanisms and growing investor interest. While SHIB and DOGE have paved the way for meme coins, MUTM’s utility-driven approach positions it as a promising contender for significant growth in the coming years. Mutuum Finance: Rising Star of DeFi Innovation Mutuum Finance is soon going to become a trendsetter in the field of decentralized finance (DeFi) with its path-breaking double-lending platform. By bringing Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models in an innovative manner uniquely, the platform has already caught a lot of attention. Already, over 9100 investors have put in presale more than $7.2 million, depicting the very high confidence and appeal of the project. With the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token price of $0.025 during Phase 4, there should be a 20% appreciation in price as the platform is in Phase 5, with an early opportunity for meaningful profit taking prior to reaching the projected market listing price of $0.06. Boosting User Activity via Leaderboards and Incentives In a bid to enhance user engagement even more and intensify loyalty, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has introduced an engaging new dashboard with a leaderboard of the top 50 token holders in real time. The top investors shall receive special bonus tokens, which shall encourage them to maintain their positions and engage with the platform in the long term. The gamified aspect strengthens both community engagement and retention. The Power of Bi-Lending The innovation at the heart of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its hybrid lending model. The P2C (Peer-to-Contract) layer allows users to earn passive income by lending USDT to liquidity pools controlled by smart contracts. By contrast, the P2P (Peer-to-Peer) layer removes intermediaries, allowing users to lend and borrow directly, giving them more privacy and control. By combining these two systems, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) achieves perfect balance between decentralization, security, and efficiency and therefore is highly attractive to both conservative and aggressive DeFi investors. Mutuum Finance Giveaway Mutuum Finance also focuses on increasing its user base through incentivizing schemes. The $100,000 giveaway will give out 10 rewards of $10,000 in MUTM tokens, while the referral scheme will give rewards for referrals made at an individual and organizational level. Platform early adopters will receive reserved staking pools, governance voting powers, and VIP updates in order to make sure they remain interested in the platform in the long term. Mutuum Finance has already secured over $7.2 million in presale funding from more than 9,100 investors, signaling serious momentum for this emerging DeFi powerhouse. The MUTM token, currently priced at $0.025, is set for a price jump to $0.03 in the next phase, with projections reaching as high as $4.75 in 2025, a potential 19,000% gain.

At the event, Julie Ziegler, Senior Communications Officer at the IMF, kicked off the discussion by reading a question submitted online by Ion Group. The question asked why El Salvador had been moving Bitcoin between accounts instead of buying more directly to grow its reserves. Ziegler said they would address that first before taking any other questions and promised Argentina would have its own section later in the session. Rodrigo Valdes, Director of the Western Hemisphere Department at the IMF, answered bluntly that El Salvador continues to follow its commitment not to add Bitcoin holdings through the public sector. “I can confirm that they continue to comply with their commitment of non-accumulation of bitcoin by the overall fiscal sector,” Rodrigo said . He made it clear there were no secret transactions happening to boost reserves through sneaky moves. IMF points to broader reforms in El Salvador Before diving further into El Salvador, the briefing changed to Honduras. A reporter asked about the IMF’s contributions to Honduras and other countries in the region facing confusion and trade tensions. Rodrigo said, “Honduras just had a staff-level agreement with the Fund. That means that we are ready to go to the Board for the review of the program, the second review.” Rodrigo explained that Honduras made strong moves when global conditions were calm, fixing structural and macroeconomic issues early. “You repair your roof when it’s sunny outside,” he added, calling Honduras a case of good preparation. Rodrigo also said that Honduras improved its reserves, secured more funds from international financial institutions (IFIs), lowered inflation, grew its economy, and made fiscal reforms, which left the country stronger against future shocks compared to before. Coming back to El Salvador, Rodrigo made it very clear that Bitcoin is not the centerpiece of their economic program. “The program of El Salvador is not about bitcoin. It’s much more, much deeper in structural reforms, in terms of governance, in terms of transparency,” he said. Rodrigo explained that the country is pushing through big changes to make government operations cleaner and more open. Fiscal reforms are also a big part of the agenda, and he confirmed that authorities are pushing forward in getting them done. The country’s program with the IMF is a 40-month deal worth $1.4 billion, but if you count what they can pull in from other IFIs, it goes up to about $3.5 billion. Rodrigo said an “important fiscal adjustment” is happening right now under this plan. The idea is to make El Salvador a better place for private businesses to invest and help the economy grow faster. Rodrigo also said that the IMF is preparing the first full review of the program. If everything continues to move the way it has, El Salvador could see even bigger gains. He stressed that the country is standing on a much stronger macroeconomic foundation now. Plus, Rodrigo said that the huge improvements in security in El Salvador over the last few years will bring extra benefits that stack on top of the better economy. After covering El Salvador and Honduras, Ziegler told the press they would finally move on to questions about Argentina, which has yet to adopt crypto yet but has its president involved in an ongoing international crypto fraud investigation.

Although the leading cryptocurrency has made several attempts to clear this region during its latest rally, it has faced repeated rejections, highlighting the presence of strong resistance. Despite these setbacks, on-chain data indicates significant whale accumulation noted on crypto exchanges, hinting that the bullish undercurrent is still strong as Bitcoin looks to end April 2025 on a postive close. Heavy Resistance Cluster Between $94,125 And $99,150 According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who shared insights from on-chain analytics platform IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin is encountering heavy resistance between the $94,125 and $99,150 price range. Related Reading: Ethereum To Hit $5k Before Its 10th Birthday, Justin Sun Says Notably, his post on social media platform X shows that approximately 2.61 million wallet addresses have accumulated about 1.76 million BTC within this zone, making it one of the densest supply barriers Bitcoin has faced in its current market cycle. As shown in the chart below, about 1.26 million addresses hold close to 843,000 BTC between $94,125 and $96,582, while another 1.35 million addresses are clustered between $96,582 and $99,146, holding roughly 917,000 BTC. This concentration of holders creates a formidable wall that Bitcoin must breach decisively if it is to continue its upward march into the next month. A strong and decisive daily or weekly close above $96,600 could invalidate the overhead resistance here, placing the next target zone at $99,150. Ultimately, the buying momentum here would clear the path for the Bitcoin price to finally target $100,000 and beyond again. Conversely, repeated failures at this zone could cause a retest of lower support levels around $93,000 and $84,000, which also have significant volumes of 678,000 BTC and 759,150 BTC, respectively. Image From X: ali_charts Bitcoin’s Bullish Structure Still Intact Even as the $94,000 to $99,000 resistance zone poses a near-term challenge, technical patterns suggest that Bitcoin’s rally is just beginning. Another prominent crypto analyst, known as Titan of Crypto, reaffirmed that Bitcoin’s long-term price target of around $125,000 is still valid. This target is derived from a massive Inverse Head and Shoulders (H&S) pattern identified on the Bitcoin monthly candlestick chart. Image From X: Titan of Crypto The chart shows a clear breakout above the neckline of the Inverse H&S formation earlier this year when Bitcoin pushed to its current all-time high around $108,790. Since then, the price action has been followed by a retest that is holding firm above a support trendline on the monthly timeframe.

Right now, smart money is watching four key names: XRP , Solana , Bitcoin , and the fast-accelerating MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . A modest $400 move today could be the positioning play of tomorrow—especially if momentum around these assets continues to strengthen as the next market cycle unfolds. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quietly Gaining Strength Where It Matters Crypto success isn’t about hype—it’s about signals. And MAGACOINFINANCE is quietly flashing every early signal that serious investors recognize. Wallet growth is climbing daily. Project updates are on schedule—and delivered clearly. Community engagement is authentic and increasing rapidly. Everything about MAGACOINFINANCE suggests a project not chasing noise but building the foundation for lasting expansion. The discovery phase won’t last forever. For those paying attention now, MAGACOINFINANCE could represent the kind of early-stage entry that historically leads to significant gains. Other Important Movers to Track: Ethereum, Chainlink, and Sei Ethereum continues to dominate smart contract deployment and decentralized application development. Its transition toward scaling solutions further strengthens its future position. Chainlink remains the leader in decentralized oracles. As real-world asset tokenization expands, Chainlink’s role will only grow, reinforcing its importance across blockchain networks. Sei is a rising star among performance-driven blockchains. Its focus on optimizing high-speed trading platforms and DeFi applications is earning it attention among developers seeking real efficiency. These projects are crucial to the ecosystem—but MAGACOINFINANCE holds the early momentum that others have already passed. Conclusion A $400 investment might not sound like much—but when it’s placed early in the right project, history shows it can scale in ways few expect.

A cryptocurrency trader has netted almost $670,000 through a trade involving the Official Trump ( TRUMP ), amid a rush by the coin’s top holders to secure an exclusive dinner with President Donald Trump. Details of the trade indicate that the investor began by swapping their entire 1.18 million Fartcoin ( FARTCOIN ) position, valued at $1.22 million, into 78,671 TRUMP tokens, according to the latest on-chain data retrieved by Finbold from Lookonchain on April 27. This transaction saw the trader move funds from Jupiter Aggregator Authority 14 to a wallet. The TRUMP token, launched by President Trump, surged in value, resulting in a portfolio worth $1.96 million and a profit of $669,000 in under a day. Crypto trader’s transactions swapping TRUMP.

Source: Lookonchain Increased TRUMP whale transactions The timing of this financial feat aligns with a recent announcement that the top 25 holders of TRUMP will receive “an ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president,” along with a special tour, according to the token’s website. As a result, the meme coin has seen an increase in whale transactions, with some investors seemingly hoping to secure a spot at the dinner table. In contrast, others have capitalized on the resulting price surge. For instance, as reported by Finbold, another unidentified trader swapped $300,000 into TRUMP in a bid to secure a dinner invitation. Additionally, Lookonchain data indicated that another unidentified trader, who had previously sold off TRUMP tokens ahead of the dinner news, re-entered the market on April 27. The investor spent $5.2 million in USDC to repurchase 337,560 TRUMP tokens at an average price of $15.39. TRUMP price analysis As of press time, TRUMP was showing signs of weakness, correcting from its recent rally triggered by the dinner announcements. The token is currently valued at $14.83, down almost 3% over the past 24 hours. However, on the weekly chart, the coin is up a massive 82%. TRUMP seven-day price chart.

Still, the short-term outlook appears positive, with the price trading well above the 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) of $10.34.

In its new World Economic Outlook Report, the IMF says that after enduring a “prolonged and unprecedented series of shocks,” the global economy appears to have stabilized. However, the IMF says the world’s financial landscape now faces significant risks as “uncertainties have climbed to new highs” due to President Trump’s threat to impose historically high tariff rates. Trump’s tariff agenda has prompted the IMF to revise “markedly” its forecasts for global growth compared to its last update in January. “For this reason, we expect that the sharp increase on April 2 in both tariffs and uncertainty will lead to a significant slowdown in global growth in the near term. While this is our central scenario— or ‘reference forecast’ — many possible paths exist, reflecting the unpredictability surrounding future trade policy and the varied impact of tariffs across different countries through a diverse set of channels… The common denominator, however, is that tariffs are a negative supply shock for the economy imposing them, as resources are reallocated toward the production of noncompetitive goods, with a resulting loss of aggregate productivity, lower activity, and higher production costs and prices. Moreover, in the medium term, by reducing competition, tariffs increase the market power of domestic producers, decrease incentives to innovate, and create multiple opportunities for rent seeking. For trading partners, tariffs constitute mostly a negative external demand shock, driving foreign customers away from their products, even if some countries could benefit from the rerouting of trade flows.” In anticipation of potential disruptions, the IMF says it has revised down its projection for global trade growth by 1.5%, with a “slight recovery” forecasted for next year.

Over 200 victims have written to U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl for the harshest punishment possible. Most are demanding that Mashinsky spend the rest of his life in prison. Mashinsky admitted to lying to customers about the company’s financial status and using their money to increase the price of Celsius’s token, CEL. Victims say his actions caused severe economic and emotional harm. Investors Share Stories of Pain Amongst the victims, one investor, Brandon Lawrence, said he lost 1.5 Bitcoin (BTC) worth about $141,000 at today’s market price. He wrote that Mashinsky destroyed many lives, and some victims even took their own lives because of their losses. Lawrence said Mashinsky should be punished like Bernie Madoff and spend life in prison. For context, Bernie Madoff was a well-respected American financier who ran the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. Another investor, Bryan Barrett, said he trusted Celsius with his savings and feels betrayed. He asked the judge to show that people who break the law and hurt others will be held responsible. Celsius Network Collapses During Crypto Winter Celsius, a well-known crypto lending platform, was one of the first big companies to collapse during the “crypto winter” of 2022. In June 2022, Celsius froze customer withdrawals, locking away $4.7 billion in customer funds. Weeks later, the company filed for bankruptcy , and Mashinsky resigned as the company’s CEO in the same year. Other companies, such as Voyager Digital, BlockFi, FTX, and Three Arrows Capital, also collapsed around the same time. However, Mashinsky’s actions stood out because prosecutors said he falsely used customer money to boost CEL’s price. Internal messages between executives revealed the truth, as they knew the price value was fake. According to a message from Chief Revenue Officer Roni Cohen-Pavon, the company appeared to be the only active buyer. Mashinsky’s Criminal Charges Mashinsky was first charged in July 2023 with seven crimes, including wire fraud and market manipulation. He later pleaded guilty to two felony counts. Despite facing up to 30 years in prison, Mashinsky has asked the court for a lighter sentence. His lawyers said they need more time to explain his actions and requested a delay. The court agreed to move sentencing from April 8 to May 8. Mashinsky has also hired two famous attorneys, Marc Mukasey and Torrey Young. These same lawyers have represented FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried and the Trump Organization. As May 8 approaches, the pressure builds. Many victims want the judge to show no leniency as they believe that Mashinsky deserves the maximum sentence.

Solana has pushed past $135, with resistance building at $144, a range that could shape near-term direction. Bittensor (TAO), meanwhile, is climbing with a 7.7% gain in the past 24 hours and bullish projections heading toward $406 this year. But while both are trending, Cold Wallet $CWT is building a privacy-first crypto wallet in presale at just $0.007 with a launch price of $0.351. With a Q3 release on the roadmap and zero-knowledge tech baked into its design, $CWT is one of the best crypto projects to buy right now. Solana (SOL): Breakout Tested at $144 Resistance Solana’s price action has turned upward, breaking above $135 following days of sideways movement. According to on-chain data and chart analysis, the range between $129 and $144 now defines its breakout potential. The $129 level has shown strong support, reinforced by a sharp rebound in mid-April. Meanwhile, resistance at $144 has already rejected bullish attempts once in late March, suggesting another test could define Solana’s next move. With over 5.75% of volume concentrated around $129, and resistance volume peaking at 5% near $144, the $139–$144 window remains critical. Solana is currently trading around $139.60, just below resistance. Bittensor (TAO): 7.7% Gain and Eyes on $406 in 2025 Bittensor’s AI-driven blockchain continues to trend upward, with TAO climbing 7.74% over the past day to trade at $305.44. Analysts see room for TAO to test $353 as its next resistance level in the short term. With growing adoption and unique architecture based on Proof of Learning (PoL), Bittensor is attracting developer and investor attention. Forecasts suggest it could reach $406 by the end of 2025, with long-range predictions hitting over $1,000 by 2028. Technical indicators remain bullish, with the 50-day SMA at $256 and RSI in the neutral zone at 66.25, suggesting momentum is still building despite recent volatility. Cold Wallet ($CWT): $0.007 Entry for Privacy-First Infrastructure Cold Wallet is solving one of the most under-addressed issues in crypto: user privacy. While other wallets track IPs and log on-chain behavior, Cold Wallet was built with a “cold by design” philosophy, eliminating surveillance and profiling through architecture, not just policy. Its use of zero-knowledge proofs allows for stealth transactions, private balance verification, and anonymous feature access, all without sacrificing usability. Now in presale at $0.007 with a confirmed launch price of $0.351, Cold Wallet offers investors a 4,900% potential ROI window at entry. This isn’t vaporware; the Q3 2025 roadmap includes an MVP launch with privacy features, followed by multichain support and exchange listings in Q4. With full GDPR compliance and institutional readiness already baked in, Cold Wallet is positioned for product delivery and broader market adoption. In a market where narratives shift quickly, $CWT is one of the few building infrastructure with long-term staying power. To Sum it Up… Bittensor’s 7.7% gain reinforces its bullish momentum, with price predictions continuing to support upside through 2025. Solana, meanwhile, is in a technical squeeze between $129 and $144, where a breakout could drive short-term rallies. However, for investors looking beyond trading zones and into real product delivery, Cold Wallet offers both timing and value. At $0.007, it provides low-cost entry into a Q3-ready launch with privacy-first features few wallets offer. With a clear roadmap and institutional-grade design, $CWT may be the most overlooked yet strategically positioned crypto to buy right now.

43872409,https://nulltx.com/?p=148362,1745776829,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Ethereum, Solana, and Unstaked: Price Outlooks and the Best Crypto for Higher Returns",https://nulltx.com/ethereum-solana-and-unstaked-price-outlooks-and-the-best-crypto-for-higher-returns/,"Ethereum Faces $1,500 Danger Zone, Solana’s $7B TVL Surge, Unstaked Emerges as Best Crypto for Higher Returns Influence is no longer earned solely through effort, it’s increasingly shaped by automation, data, and strategic deployment. Ethereum’s recent derivative inflows suggest short-term caution, while Solana is seeing momentum driven by institutional demand and increased network activity. Yet, among these shifts, Unstaked crypto introduces a distinct approach. Instead of relying on price movement or passive holding, it offers a functional utility: AI agents that turn social engagement into on-chain value. With $UNSD currently in presale, it’s drawing interest as the best crypto for higher returns, not just through speculation, but by tying influence directly to measurable digital activity. Ethereum (ETH) Price Outlook The Ethereum (ETH) price outlook has taken a cautious turn following a significant spike in exchange inflows. Specifically, on April 16, more than 77,000 ETH were sent to derivative exchanges, marking the highest single-day transfer in recent months. Historically, similar inflows have coincided with price pullbacks; therefore, concerns of potential short-term sell pressure have intensified. Consequently, the market’s reaction to this data reflects growing trader caution, especially with Ethereum struggling to break past resistance near $1,620. Furthermore, momentum indicators underscore this hesitation. For instance, the MACD has shown a subdued bullish crossover, implying weakening sell-side momentum, while the RSI remains near 40, suggesting that bearish sentiment still has the upper hand. Without stronger demand or supportive macro signals, Ethereum may retest the $1,500 support level. As a result, while the market digests these flows and broader sentiment remains cautious, the Ethereum (ETH) price outlook leans defensive, with short-term movements likely influenced by derivative activity and external risk factors. Institutional Demand and Network Activity Push Solana (SOL) Price Up Solana (SOL) price is up this week, driven by strong institutional interest and rising on-chain engagement. In particular, the launch of multiple spot Solana ETFs in Canada on April 16 has sparked notable attention. Additionally, with staking features included, these ETFs offer a regulated pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to SOL, boosting both demand and liquidity. Moreover, Solana has seen over $120 million in capital bridged from other chains in the past month, reflecting a rising preference for the network’s ecosystem. As a result, its total value locked (TVL) climbed to $7.08 billion, a 12% increase that signals robust DeFi activity. On the technical front, SOL broke out from a falling wedge pattern after bouncing from long-term support near $95. Furthermore, the RSI shifted from 33 to 55, suggesting renewed bullish momentum. Taken together, all these elements contribute to the upward momentum, keeping the Solana (SOL) price up and in focus. Turn Your X Account into an Engagement Machine Unstaked is redefining how creators and influencers grow on X (formerly Twitter). With its AI-powered social agents, even a quiet account can evolve into a high-performing engagement hub. Specifically, users simply configure their agent’s communication style and goals once. From there, the AI handles the heavy lifting: monitoring mentions, replying in real time, and posting curated content tailored to audience interests. In fact, this isn’t just automation. Rather, it’s a full-service growth engine. Unstaked agents adapt their strategies based on social signals, keeping interactions relevant and organic. Therefore, whether a creator is asleep or offline, their presence continues building effortlessly and intelligently. What makes this even more powerful is how activity translates into income. Every meaningful engagement tracked on-chain feeds into Unstaked’s Proof of Intelligence framework, rewarding users in $UNSD tokens. In this system, influence is earned, measured, and paid for, turning engagement into value. Currently in presale batch 1, $UNSD is priced at just $0.0065, presenting a rare opportunity for early adopters. With an estimated launch price of $0.1819, it stands out as the best crypto for higher returns in the current cycle. Accordingly, for creators seeking to monetize their influence and maximize reach with minimal effort, Unstaked offers a game-changing toolset. From Passive Holding to Active Engagement As Ethereum faces pressure from speculative flows and Solana gains traction through institutional interest, Unstaked presents an alternative path, one where engagement itself becomes the asset. Rather than waiting for price movements or relying on network metrics alone, Unstaked users actively build value through autonomous AI agents that drive community interaction and on-chain results. It reframes the role of the user from investor to participant, linking presence with performance. For those seeking the best crypto for higher returns, this shift from passive ownership to earned influence may be the most significant opportunity of all.

Spotting the best altcoins to buy now means going beyond hype and looking at real potential. In 2025, a few coins are showing they’re not just riding trends, they’re aiming to shape the next bull cycle. Web3 ai is catching attention with its mix of artificial intelligence and blockchain at a price that’s still within reach. Meanwhile, Stellar is moving forward with real-world asset tokenization. Shiba Inu is preparing for big infrastructure moves, and Algorand is showing signs of a strong technical recovery. But among them, Web3 ai stands out in April with AI-powered tools already helping users in the crypto space. 1. Web3 ai: Early Access to AI and Crypto Tools Web3 ai is building a name as one of the best altcoins to buy now with strong real-time tools built for DeFi. Its 12 AI tools include auto-trading bots, portfolio trackers, scam alerts, and yield guides, all working together to help users in fast-changing markets. These aren’t future promises, they’re live. Using real-time data and AI tech like NLP and deep learning, Web3 ai gives users sharp insights. The presale is in Stage 1, with $WAI priced at $0.0003. The confirmed listing price is $0.005242, offering a 1,747% return at launch. With 50 presale stages set, and each round priced higher than the last, getting in early could mean serious gains. Web3 ai is already running and delivering real value, not just building hype. 2. Stellar (XLM): Boosting Real-World Asset Value Stellar is pushing to lead the space in tokenizing real-world assets. The team aims to grow on-chain RWA value to $3 billion by end of 2025, up from $290 million in 2024. Big names like Paxos, Ondo, and SG Forge are backing the effort. XLM trades near $0.235, but some experts expect a dip to $0.203 before recovery. Still, charts show growing strength with RSI rising and hints of a golden cross, which could lift the price to $0.30 or even $0.40. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Community-Driven Meme Coin Though known for its meme status, Shiba Inu has plans that go way beyond that. Currently priced at $0.00001167 after a 45% drop this year, SHIB could climb to $0.0000399 by year-end, up 242%. Some longer-term projections even call for 7,220% growth by 2035. Shibarium, the upcoming Layer-3 upgrade, could turn SHIB into a serious infrastructure coin. Still, nearly 13.7 trillion tokens sit just below the $0.00001250 mark, which could create short-term price swings. 4. Algorand (ALGO): Real-Use Cases and Strong Signals ALGO is gaining momentum after dropping to $0.148 on April 7. It’s now at about $0.20, a 36% jump. It broke a downward pattern, and a nearly 15% rise in open interest suggests new market energy. Binance volume jumped 300%, and tools like RSI and MACD show bullish signs. On top of that, Algorand is being used more in tokenization and AI-linked areas, both fast-growing spaces. If it clears $0.22, more gains could follow fast. Final Remarks! In a sea of options, it’s rare to see coins with solid basics, growth plans, and affordable entry points. Web3 ai is clearly leading among the best altcoins to buy now , offering early movers a real edge in the AI meets Web3 space. Stellar’s work with real-world assets, SHIB’s Layer-3 roadmap, and ALGO’s strong price action round out a solid set of 2025 picks. Whether you want reliable progress or bold upside, these coins show real potential. All four offer something different, and that mix could pay off big in 2025 and beyond.

However, as the price approaches the critical $100K psychological threshold, a temporary consolidation phase is expected before any further breakout. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Bitcoin has recently notched a strong bullish signal, staging a major market shift driven by substantial buying pressure. This rally has propelled the price above a critical resistance zone, reclaiming both the 100 and 200-day moving averages at $90K — a key indication of buyers’ dominance. Currently, BTC is approaching the psychological $100K threshold, a major resistance likely filled with significant supply. As a result, a temporary consolidation around this level is expected before any potential breakout occurs. A decisive move above $100K would likely pave the way toward retesting the all-time high (ATH). The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, Bitcoin confirmed its bullish momentum after breaking above the descending channel’s upper boundary at $84K. This breakout triggered an impulsive surge, pushing the price past the critical $90K resistance level, highlighting strong buyer commitment. Now, the asset is nearing the crucial $100K psychological resistance, which also aligns with a major previous swing high. If buyers succeed in breaching this barrier, the road to Bitcoin’s ATH could reopen. Conversely, failure to break above may lead to a short-term consolidation below $100K before the next significant move. On-chain Analysis By Shayan After Bitcoin completed its corrections and initiated recoveries in October 2023 and September 2024, Binance Futures funding rates notably turned deeply negative during the early stages of each rally. This recurring pattern highlights a persistent lack of investor confidence during sharp declines or prolonged consolidations. In contrast, during strong Bitcoin rallies, FOMO-driven traders aggressively deployed leverage to open long positions, causing funding rates to spike sharply. This often signaled overheated conditions and triggered subsequent corrective pullbacks. Currently, Bitcoin has surged more than 28% off its recent low. Following this rally, the funding rates have, with a delay, experienced a significant upward shift, signaling a renewed influx of leveraged long positioning. Considering the historical behavior during the previous two major recoveries, current sentiment dynamics, and price structure strongly suggest that Bitcoin is well-positioned to break through its previous all-time highs in the near term.

The capital inflow reflects growing institutional confidence in the face of market volatility. Bitcoin’s price dipped below $94,000 on Sunday, according to CoinGecko data, reflecting broader selling pressure throughout the crypto market. The aggregate assets under management of Bitcoin ETFs are now at $109.27 billion. The products account for approximately 5.8% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization, according to analytics website SoSoValue . The bullish ETF trend suggests long-term investors continue to buy in, even as Bitcoin faces near-term price weakness. BlackRock Leads Weekly Inflows Investor sentiment for Bitcoin ETFs rebounded strongly after weeks of to-and-fro price action. Daily inflows touched as much as $379.99 million on April 25 to take the weekly tally over $3 billion. This is a complete reversal from early April when the market saw $713.30 million in net outflows. Leading the inflows was BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which added $240.15 million in a single day. IBIT remains the behemoth in the Bitcoin ETF category with $56.03 billion in assets under management and $41.20 billion in net inflows since inception. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) was another high flier, recording $108.04 million in daily inflows and managing a total of $19.12 billion in assets. Other funds that saw large inflows included ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB), which added $11.39 million, and Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (BTC), which attracted $19.87 million — even as Grayscale’s legacy GBTC fund continued to see outflows. Trading Volume Spikes as Investor Interest Increases Along with the strong inflows, Bitcoin ETF trading volume also jumped strongly. The total value traded was $18.76 billion for the week, more than double the $7.15 billion in the previous week. Bitcoin spot ETFs have received a cumulative $38.43 billion in net inflows since launch, a reflection of their growing footprint in the market. While Grayscale’s GBTC has seen $22.69 billion in outflows following its conversion from a trust structure, the broader ETF complex remains healthy, with a steady stream of new capital coming in. Despite Bitcoin’s price struggles, ETF demand suggests institutional investors are optimistic about the long-term outlook for the world’s largest cryptocurrency.",Bitcoin|Regulation,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-04-27 18:10:00

The direction of this breakout will be crucial in determining the cryptocurrency’s next major trend. XRP Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart Following a rebound from the crucial 200-day moving average at $1.7, Ripple (XRP) has entered a low-volatility consolidation phase, trading within a very tight range. This range is defined by the dynamic 100-day and 200-day moving averages, currently positioned at $2.4 and $1.9, respectively, reflecting market indecision. Notably, the 100-day MA at $2.4 aligns with the upper boundary of a prolonged descending wedge pattern. A confirmed breakout above this level could mark a significant bullish shift, potentially initiating a fresh upward leg toward higher resistance zones. The 4-Hour Chart On the lower timeframe, XRP has recently invalidated a breakout attempt above its prior swing high at $2.2, forming what appears to be a bull trap. This has led to continued sideways price action, signaling an ongoing equilibrium between buyers and sellers. A decisive breakout above the $2.2 line would establish a new higher high and likely confirm a bullish market structure shift. This would set the stage for a rally toward the $2.5 resistance, which corresponds with the upper boundary of the descending wedge. Conversely, if Ripple fails to overcome this key boundary, a retracement toward the critical $1.7 support zone becomes increasingly probable.
