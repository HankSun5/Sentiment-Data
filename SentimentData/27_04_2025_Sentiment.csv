Expert Analysts Give Their Predictions,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-history-repeat-itself-in-bitcoin-btc-expert-analysts-give-their-predictions/,"Cryptocurrency analysis company Alphractal drew attention to Bitcoin’s 4-year fractal cycle in its latest report. The company stated that this cycle has been repeated consistently since 2015, making BTC one of the most symmetrical assets in financial history. In its analysis published in November 2024, Alphractal predicted that the next cycle peak for Bitcoin could occur between October 12-16, 2025. Now, with only 6 months left until this estimated peak, the report stated that the fractal structure is still intact. The company stated that Bitcoin has determined both the top and the bottom of every cycle without error since 2015, which is an unprecedented achievement in the financial world.

It was noted that if history repeats itself, remarkable price movements could occur in the coming months. “Time will tell, but for now, Bitcoin's strong and delicate fractal structure remains intact.

Speaking during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group spring meetings in Washington, Muhammad confirmed that Pakistan already holds a 30 billion yuan currency swap with China but now wants to boost it to 40 billion yuan. “From our perspective, getting to 40 billion renminbi would be a good place to move towards… we just put in that request,” Muhammad said . The swap expansion request ties into Pakistan’s urgent need to keep access to foreign currencies stable while strengthening its financial reserves. Besides pushing for a larger swap deal, Muhammad said Pakistan is getting close to launching its first-ever Panda bond, which is debt issued in China’s domestic market and denominated in yuan. Talks have been underway with the heads of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to secure credit enhancements for the bond issuance. Muhammad said discussions with both banks have been “constructive” and added, “We want to diversify our lending base and we have made some good progress around that—we are hoping that during this calendar year we can do an initial print.” Pakistan pushes for more support while managing new tensions China has been pushing swap agreements with several emerging economies, including Argentina and Sri Lanka, and now Pakistan is trying to extend its arrangement to keep up with growing financial needs. Muhammad said the plan to issue the Panda bond fits into Pakistan’s broader strategy to tap new markets and avoid overreliance on traditional lenders. On the international aid front, Muhammad said he expects the IMF executive board to approve Pakistan’s new $1.3 billion deal under a climate resilience loan program in early May. This approval will also cover the first review of the country’s existing $7 billion bailout package. Once the IMF board signs off, Pakistan will immediately unlock a $1 billion payout, a vital piece of the financial plan Pakistan secured in 2024 to prevent a full-blown economic collapse. Asked about the effects of escalating tensions with India, Muhammad said it would be “not helpful” for Pakistan’s economic outlook. Earlier this month, after the killing of 26 men at a tourist site, both countries retaliated. Pakistan shut its airspace to Indian airlines and froze trade ties. India responded by suspending the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, which controls how water from the Indus River system is shared. Muhammad pointed out that even before the latest dispute, trade between the two countries had already shrunk massively, totaling just $1.2 billion last year. Turning back to the domestic economy, Muhammad forecasted that Pakistan would hit about 3% growth for the financial year ending in June 2025. He said the country is aiming for growth of 4-5% the following year, with longer-term hopes of reaching 6%. He emphasized that expanding financial sources like the Panda bond, enlarging the swap line, and securing IMF funds are all pieces needed to hit those targets. Meanwhile, amid Pakistan’s strengthening relationship with China, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent met with Asian Development Bank President Masato Kanda on Friday. Bessent pressed Kanda to start moving China toward “graduation” from ADB borrowing, arguing that China’s economy no longer needs the same level of development bank assistance. The Treasury Department said Bessent also pushed Kanda to focus on “best value” procurement practices and pointed out the need for an “all-of-the-above energy strategy,” including financing options for civilian nuclear power projects.

Find Out!,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/was-jed-mccalebs-exit-from-ripple-a-breakup-or-a-brilliant-strategy-find-out/,"The post Was Jed McCaleb’s Exit from Ripple a ‘Breakup’ or a Brilliant Strategy? Find Out! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Jed McCaleb’s departure from Ripple in 2014 has long been the subject of speculation. Many believed it was the end of his involvement with the company, but what if it wasn’t a breakup? What if Jed’s split was a strategic move, part of a bigger plan to create a parallel blockchain system? Ripple & Stellar: Split That Wasn’t a Split Jed McCaleb, one of Ripple’s co-founders, was key in designing XRP’s early framework. He helped build XRP’s architecture and contributed to Ripple’s initial success. After some disagreements, Jed McCaleb left Ripple in 2014 and quickly started Stellar (XLM). (1/ ) Jed Didn’t Leave Ripple. He Was Assigned to Start Stellar. You were told it was all falling out. But what if Jed McCaleb’s split wasn’t a breakup… It was a deployment? And what if XRP and XLM were never rivals — but two arms of the same global plan? Let’s dive deep: pic.twitter.com/0v53GExE3j — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) April 26, 2025 While many thought it was a breakup, the timing looks more like a planned move. It happened just as Ripple was growing in the world of big finance and global payment systems. Eventually, if we look at the timing of Jed’s departure, it aligns perfectly with Ripple’s institutional expansion, the rise of the ISO 20022 standard , and discussions by global financial bodies like the IMF, the BIS, and the WEF about the future of payments. This suggests that Jed wasn’t leaving; he was deployed to launch the second half of a global payment solution. XRP and XLM: Complementary, Not Competitive Ripple’s XRP and Stellar’s XLM were never rivals; they were two parts of the same global plan. XRP focuses on improving liquidity, enabling cross-border payments, and supporting central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the financial industry. On the other hand, Stellar works on bringing blockchain technology to underserved communities, humanitarian efforts, and retail stablecoin transactions. Strategic Partnerships on Both Sides Both Ripple and Stellar have quietly secured powerful partnerships. Ripple works with major financial institutions like Bank of America and SBI, supporting international banking systems. Meanwhile, Stellar is closely tied to humanitarian projects, with the United Nations using it for blockchain-based aid and Franklin Templeton using it for tokenizing assets. Jed McCaleb’s exit from Ripple wasn’t an accident; it was part of a well-timed plan. As Ripple focused on the institutional side, McCaleb’s Stellar project set out to bring the power of blockchain to the people.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY|XLM|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-26 20:37:32

On Saturday, Tesla’s Canadian website posted a banner that said: “Explore pre-tariff priced inventory while supplies last.” The move came after President Donald Trump dropped a fresh 25% tariff last month on Canadian goods, including vehicles with parts made outside the US, even under the US-Mexico-Canada trade pact. Canada immediately hit back with retaliatory import taxes aimed at mirroring the American tariffs. Pricing on Tesla’s site as of April 26 showed a big gap between new orders and existing inventory. A new long-range Model 3 with all-wheel drive jumped to C$79,990 (about $57,700). But identical 2025 model year cars already sitting in inventory were listed for around C$69,000. The difference made it obvious Tesla wanted buyers to move fast before getting hammered by higher prices. The sharp price increases were first spotted by DriveTeslaCanada.ca, which reported that for some models, the hikes are brutal. New orders for the all-wheel drive Cybertruck are now up to 22% more expensive than inventory models. For Canadian buyers trying to hold out, that’s bad news. Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, hasn’t made things easier north of the border either. Elon took heat in Canada after standing by Trump, who has openly joked that he wants Canada to join the United States. The eccentric billionaire recently promised that starting next month, he would spend more time focusing on Tesla, after the carmaker suffered its worst first-quarter financial results in years. Tesla stock rises after US pushes faster self-driving car rules Tesla shares jumped nearly 10% on Friday after Trump’s White House announced a plan to speed up self-driving vehicle approvals. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy revealed new rules that loosen federal safety standards for autonomous vehicles. That announcement gave Tesla a rare win after a rough few months. The rally followed a long stretch of losses for Tesla, with shares dropping around 40% since the beginning of 2025. The trade wars, tariffs, and nonstop market swings made it worse. Tesla also posted its worst quarterly loss since 2022 during the first three months of this year. Wall Street scrambled to respond. Piper Sandler said the earnings report was “the best result that TSLA bulls could’ve reasonably hoped for,” noting that “management said enough to keep the dream alive.” Even though problems still exist, the firm said the update helped calm some fears. Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said he thinks Tesla can make more money from software tied to full self-driving technology over the long term. But despite the optimism, Delaney kept Goldman’s neutral rating and cut Tesla’s price target. Others stayed skeptical. UBS and Wells Fargo both kept negative outlooks on Tesla. Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan cut the firm’s price target for Tesla from $130 to $120. UBS warned that excitement over Tesla’s planned June robo-taxi launch might push the stock price up temporarily, but said it could end badly for some investors. They also flagged that Tesla might drop its plan for a low-cost vehicle launch, killing a potential catalyst for future growth. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Amid the ongoing market euphoria, prominent blockchain analytics company Glassnode has shared some important developments in the Bitcoin derivative markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Apparent Demand’ Makes Sharp Rebound – Will BTC Breakout Soon? Bitcoin Short Bets Rise Despite Price Rally, Setting Stage For Volatility Despite a bullish trading week, derivative traders are approaching the Bitcoin market with skepticism, as evidenced by a build-up of leveraged short positions. In a recent X post on April 25, Glassnode reported that Open Interest (OI) in Bitcoin perpetual swaps climbed to 218,000 BTC, marking a 15.6% increase from early March. In line with market activity, this rise in Open Interest aligns with increased leverage, introducing the potential for market volatility via liquidations or stop-outs. Generally, a rise in Open Interest amidst a price rally is expected to signal long-term market confidence. However, Glassnode’s findings have revealed an opposite scenario. Despite Bitcoin’s bullish strides in the past week, short market positions appear to be dominating the perpetual futures markets. This concerning development is indicated by a decline in the average funding rate, which has now slipped into negative territory to sit around -0.023%. The perpetual funding rate is a periodic payment between long and short traders aimed at keeping the contract price in line with the underlying spot price. A negative funding rate indicates short traders pay long traders as Bitcoin’s perpetual contract price is trading below the spot price. This is caused by a higher number of short positions as traders are largely bearish about Bitcoin, even despite recent gains. Furthermore, the 7-day moving average (7DMA) of long-side funding premiums has dropped to $88,000 per hour, reinforcing this short-dominant sentiment. This downtrend indicates a waning demand for long positions, as traders exhibit a short bias. However, Glassnode presents a bullish note stating that the present combination of rising leverage and short positions paves the way for a potential short squeeze, where an unexpected upward price move forces short-sellers to close their positions, thereby driving prices even higher. Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $94,629 following a 1.01% retracement from its local peak price on April 25. Despite creeping developments in the perpetual futures market, the BTC market remains highly bullish, indicated by gains of 1.02%, 11.12%, and 8.32% in the last one, seven, and thirty days, respectively. With a market cap of $1.88 trillion, the premier cryptocurrency ranks as the largest digital asset and fifth-largest asset in the world.

This rebound, fueled by fear, confusion, and desperate buyers, happened so fast it left most traders spinning. According to data from CNBC, the index jumped more than 10% from its lowest close and ripped 14% higher from the savage April 7 intraday low. The snap rally kicked off after a massive flight out of US dollar assets and Treasuries created a gaping hole in the market. The S&P 500 punched right into the gap left by the April 3 panic selloff. On a closing basis, the index has recovered exactly half of what it lost, but the damage to investor confidence and market structure still stinks. Buyers rush in as technical signals flash green Some of the technical signals flashing during this rebound would make a Wall Street nerd drool. Thursday triggered the rare and hyped-up Zweig breadth thrust, where the market sees a cluster of extreme positive breadth days after being smashed down. There have been 19 known cases of this since the 1940s, and every time, the S&P 500 finished higher six to twelve months later. Still, some analysts argue that recent decades brought more false alarms because of decimalized trading and a flood of ETFs letting people yank the whole market around at once. Bespoke Investment Group said every stock in the Nasdaq 100 went green on Tuesday. The S&P 500 also posted three straight days of gains over 1.5% from Tuesday to Thursday. History shows that when either of those two freak events happens, the market is usually higher a year later. But with small sample sizes and typical 12-month market gains anyway, nobody should be calling it safe just yet. Retail investors were the only ones consistently buying the dip, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s private-client flow data. Meanwhile, fast-money speculators flooded back after the multi-day rally last week. Jonathan Krinsky from BTIG, who had called for a short-term rally, warned Friday that the market could stall. He said the Goldman Sachs Retail Favorites Basket spiked 11.4% in just four trading days. The last two times that happened, in November 2022 and March 2022, massive plunges followed almost immediately. Tariffs fuel fears of deeper economic pain The recent S&P 500 drop fits a weird pattern where stocks bottom just shy of a 20% loss on a closing basis. The closing low in this pullback slipped a hair past 19%, which happened in 1990, 1998, 2011, and 2018, too. Only 1990 came with a US recession. But now, the odds of a full-blown recession are shooting up fast. Trump’s tariff war has companies slashing hiring plans and investments, bracing for harder times ahead. Trump’s delay on tariff hikes and talk of possible trade deals gave investors hope that the worst might still be avoided. But everyone is watching if soft economic data, like consumer surveys and CEO sentiment, starts leaking into hard facts like jobs and spending numbers. The start of Q1 earnings season brought a typical 70% of companies beating expectations, but CEOs had almost nothing good to say about the future. The tariff cloud hangs over everything. Companies are basically admitting they can’t give real guidance because this one man could yank the tariffs higher at any moment with literally no warning. FactSet reported, “To date, the market is rewarding positive earnings surprises reported by S&P 500 companies for Q1 more than average and punishing negative earnings surprises reported by S&P 500 companies for Q1 less than average.” Research from 3Fourteen shows that after 10% corrections, future earnings projections split depending on whether a recession hits. Before the last few weeks, the forecast looked more like the “no recession” track, but now estimates are slipping, raising more alarm. The liquidation frenzy that hit a few weeks back, mixed with the global “Sell America” wave, made even weak hints at easing tariffs and slightly better economic data enough to yank stocks higher. But closing the rest of the gap from February’s highs won’t be easy. Past panics like Russia’s 1998 default and the 2011 debt-ceiling mess didn’t feel resolved when the market started to bounce either. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The market has been rife with up-and-coming assets, each promising the next big thing. You’ve probably seen how fast coins like Solana exploded and became a “must-have,” only for it to settle and leave a few scratching their heads. With the rise of new projects in 2025, there’s one coin that’s currently making waves: Qubetics ($TICS). Could it be the next big thing? While the likes of Solana were once considered the future, could Qubetics be the missed opportunity of tomorrow? Let’s dive in and take a closer look. As the crypto market continues to shift, one thing remains clear—timing is everything. Solana was once the talk of the town, offering scalability and speed. But now, as its growth slows, attention has started to shift toward other rising stars. That’s where Qubetics comes into play. With its innovative tech and strong fundamentals, this new project is quickly gaining traction. The Qubetics presale has already raised over $16.4 million, and the token’s price is still incredibly affordable at $0.1902. Here’s why Qubetics might just be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. Solana: A Missed Opportunity or a Lesson Learned? Solana was once hailed as the “Ethereum Killer.” It promised to solve the scalability problems that Ethereum struggled with, offering faster transaction speeds and lower fees. During its peak, Solana soared to new heights, pushing its price to over $250 per token. If you caught the Solana wave early on, you were likely sitting on some serious gains. But now, things are different. The once-mighty Solana has seen its value fluctuate, and while it’s still a top crypto asset, it’s no longer the new and shiny thing. For some, Solana’s rise was the stuff of dreams, but its later decline serves as a reminder of how volatile the market can be. Despite its speed and scalability, Solana faced network outages, security concerns, and increased competition. These factors led some to lose faith in its long-term potential. But what if you missed the boat on Solana? If you did, you might be feeling a bit of FOMO, especially as new projects like Qubetics pop up with fresh promises. Unlike Solana, Qubetics seems to be addressing real-world issues that many previous crypto projects couldn’t. Why Qubetics ($TICS) Is the Next Big Thing in Crypto Now, let’s talk about Qubetics. Unlike Solana, which focused primarily on scalability and speed, Qubetics is here to solve some of the most pressing problems faced by businesses and individuals in today’s digital world. One of the key reasons Qubetics is gaining attention is its focus on interoperability. It’s designed to work seamlessly across various blockchain platforms, enabling different networks to communicate and share data effortlessly. In a world where cross-chain compatibility is still a challenge, Qubetics has positioned itself as the solution. The Qubetics presale is currently in its 31st stage, and it has already sold over 509 million tokens to more than 25,200 holders, raising over $16.4 million. Despite all this success, the price of $TICS is still just $0.1902 per token in the current presale stage, making it an affordable entry point. Analysts predict that after the presale, $TICS could soar to $1, giving holders a 425% return on investment. If the price hits $5 after the presale, that’s a staggering 2527% ROI. And if $TICS reaches $15 after the mainnet launch, holders could see an astronomical 7783% return. With such promising predictions, Qubetics is positioning itself as the next crypto superstar.

This surge has propelled several alternative coins into the spotlight. Among them, SUI , VIRTUAL , and WLD are making notable gains. The article explores their current performance and potential for future growth, shedding light on which coins might see continued upward movement. SUI Bullish Surge: Gains and Key Price Levels SUI experienced a 37.16% rise over the last month and a remarkable 104.78% gain within six months. Price gains have been swift and pronounced, with weekly changes reaching 69.65% and stirring strong market interest. The data reflects a robust move upward over both recent short-term and longer-term periods, highlighting the coin’s growing momentum. SUI now trades between $1.74 and $3.03, with immediate resistance at $3.78 and a second hurdle at $5.07, while support is seen at $1.21. A high RSI of 77.58 indicates strong buying pressure, though caution is warranted for potential pullbacks. Traders might consider targeting resistance levels and watching for a breakout to signal the next leg in this market move. Virtuals Protocol Price Movements Amid Recent Volatility VIRTUAL experienced a rapid surge over the past week with prices soaring almost 93%. The one-month change reflected a solid gain of around 45.57%. However, over the half-year, the coin saw a moderate decline of 13.61%, indicating a mix of performance. Price changes have been characterized by short-term spikes and more tempered mid-term corrections. Recent activity suggests increased trading interest, but a stable long-term trend has not yet formed. Current trading sits between $0.35 and $1.02, with key resistance at $1.46 and solid support near $0.12. A high RSI near 79 signals bullish pressure, though caution is warranted. Traders might consider buying near support and monitoring for breaks above resistance while placing stops around the lower level for risk management. Worldcoin Market Outlook: Short-Term Gains Amid Longer-Term Decline Last month, WLD showed a clear rebound with a 26.55% increase and a 66.14% jump over one week. Despite this bullish momentum, the six-month figure dipped significantly by 42.39%. Price action has been characterized by volatility, with rapid rallies followed by notable pullbacks, creating a mixed picture of recent performance. Current trading stays between a low of $0.35 and a resistance near $1.47, indicating upbeat short-term momentum driven by bullish pressure. The range between $0.56 and $1.12 suggests a potential buying zone. Traders should monitor a breakout above $1.47 or consider exiting if the level fails to hold, ensuring risk management within these key levels. Conclusion The recent bounce in Bitcoin has led to a surge in altcoins like SUI , VIRTUAL , and WLD . SUI is showing strong potential with growing interest. VIRTUAL is gaining momentum driven by innovative features. WLD has seen a significant rise and continues to attract attention for its unique offerings. The positive trend in Bitcoin has provided a much-needed boost for these altcoins, suggesting an optimistic outlook in both the short and long term. Future performance of these coins will depend on sustained interest and further market developments. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Simkus reported on Friday at the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund in Washington that global trade weakness, largely caused by new US tariffs, is bringing a new threat to Europe’s economy. He also noted that inflation was already declining and could slow down even further in the coming months. The deposit rate was cut for the seventh time since June last year, to 2.25%. However, Simkus thinks there is still room to ease policy without generating financial instability or overheating the economy. Simkus said there was no reason to remain in the current financial environment and that he could not rule out two more cuts this year, given the data he had in front of him. However, he added that more negative surprises would be needed to move lower. His remarks echo what the market has been expecting. Investors are betting on at least two further rate cuts this year. Some analysts, including the ones at Bank of America, forecast that the deposit rate could drop by 1.25% by December, suggesting four further tiny cuts. Simkus also emphasized that the ECB’s approach remained nimble and said he did not think they were late cutting interest rates. US tariffs and strong euro drag down expansion New evidence points to a softening of the eurozone’s economic recovery. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for eurozone GDP, citing mounting trade tensions and tighter financial conditions as key factors. Simkus conceded that policymakers had been “overly optimistic” in predicting how fast the economy would rebound. He added that slower wage growth throughout the euro area has become a symptom of cooling demand. He also cited the recent strength of the euro against other currencies, which makes European exports less competitive abroad. US tariffs, meanwhile, have diverted more Chinese goods to Europe, adding disinflationary pressure. These factors are likely to be reflected in the ECB’s next batch of economic projections, which are set to be published in June. According to Simkus, the new numbers “are expected to include weaker economic growth and slower inflation than the assumptions” made in the previous forecast. Nevertheless, Simkus discounted even more substantial interest rate reductions unless the economy weakens precipitously. For now, the ECB will probably stick to its usual quarter-point steps. EC B sets the pace for action, not reliant on US deals Simkus also emphasized that the ECB will not sit back and wait until the US trade negotiations are imminent. The 90-day wait by the administration of President Trump was an attempt to impose some tariffs as binary options to enable trade agreements with major trading partners. Even with the US ultimatums to some countries, Simkus warned that trade policy uncertainty will probably remain. Several ECB officials shared similar views last week, citing softer manufacturing data and weaker growth in the service sector. Now, markets are watching economic data and the comments from ECB officials up to the bank’s next policy meeting in June. If the economy stays weak, a further rate cut could occur as soon as that meeting, leaving the ECB firmly on its current course of cautious but steady easing.

According to the company’s data, RAY has the highest Long/Short ratio among all altcoins. Following RAY, GTC, COS, DOT, ALPHA, MELANIA, AUDIO and REZ are among the other altcoins where long positions are higher than shorts. The Alphractal team noted that excessively high long/short ratios generally negatively impact altcoin performance, but can also occasionally trigger price bottoms. According to the company, this can create a short squeeze dynamic, with traders closing long positions and opening short positions when prices start to rise again. However, it was emphasized that an increase in Open Interest volume is required for this scenario to occur. Alphractal predicts that there is currently no significant increase in Open Interest in altcoins, so prices may move sideways in the coming days.

Wedson stated that the Bitcoin/Stablecoin Reserve Ratio on Binance has given a signal in the $76,000–$77,000 range again, reminding that this level has predicted major Bitcoin rallies in the past. Wedson used the following statements in his statement: “This behavior suggests that stablecoin reserves are growing faster than Bitcoin reserves, suggesting that there is ample capital ready to flow into crypto assets. The same signal appeared after the ‘Coronadump’ in 2020, at the end of 2022, and now again. In all of these instances, the Bitcoin price reacted positively.” *This is not investment advice.

Instead, employees say it barely works, and a mismanaged launch has left many wondering if automation is the right path for America’s largest social services agency. In recent months, Musk’s organization, known internally as DOGE , has aggressively reduced federal agencies by cutting jobs and budgets. The push toward an “AI-first” model aims to replace human workers with software wherever possible. As part of that strategy, the new chatbot was built into the everyday workflows of agency staffers, reported by Wired, with the promise of easing their workload. An internal email described it as a way to “assist employees with everyday tasks and enhance productivity,” but in practice, the app has received little attention. Sources inside the agency say the roll-out was accompanied by a painfully bad training video featuring a poorly animated, four-fingered woman. The clip was supposed to guide users through the app’s features, but it failed to warn staff against uploading sensitive personal data. This slip forced the agency to send a follow-up email reading, “Our apologies for the oversight in our training video,” to warn employees of the risk. Few people have taken the SSA AI training video seriously “I’m not sure most of my coworkers even watched the training video,” one Social Security staffer told Wired. They added that when they tested the chatbot, “several of the responses I received from it were incredibly vague and/or inaccurate.” Other employees reportedly mocked the crude graphics. “Nobody I know is [using it]. It’s so clumsy and bad,” the source said. Critics warn that this stumbling start may foreshadow wider failures. Similarly, in Brazil, during 2018, a state-owned company called Dataprev launched Meu INSS, an app designed to process social security claims using computer vision and natural language processing. However, the system has often rejected valid claims due to minor errors, triggering lengthy legal appeals. One example involves 55-year-old Josélia de Brito, a former sugarcane worker whose retirement application was denied because the automated system misidentified her gender. “I have all the documents proving my health condition, proving everything, and [the benefit] still gets denied. It’s a humiliation,” she told the Rest of World. Rural farmworkers, many of whom lack basic digital skills, have struggled with the shift to online services. “People out here cannot [even] work with Gmail, Facebook, Instagram,” said Francisco Santana, president of the Union for Rural Workers at Barra do Corda. “Processes are [getting] more and more automated, and society wasn’t made ready for it, especially further away, in the outskirts, for people that live in rural areas.” Those hurdles abroad highlight potential pitfalls for the U.S. Social services are already under pressure to “modernize,” a push that began under the Trump administration’s team of so-called technocrats. Musk’s DOGE has taken that mission further by seeking to cut the federal workforce in half. “Everything that can be machine-automated will be. And the technocrats will replace the bureaucrats,” a person familiar with DOGE’s plans told the Washington Post. DOGE’s emphasis on automation has bred confusion rather than efficiency. A recent mishap at the SSA illustrates the stakes. DOGE staff reportedly marked “countless” living benefit recipients as “dead,” cutting off their payments. “About 4 million people, they marked them as dead,” said Rennie Glasgow, a longtime claims technical analyst at the agency, speaking to The Daily Beast. “They’re sending us an email saying, ‘If these people come into the office with their identification, you can reinstate them.’” That reinstatement process can take “about three to four days,” Glasgow added, as staff must manually “resurrect” each recipient in the system. Beyond stopping benefits, DOGE also plans to rewrite the SSA’s entire software codebase within months. Sources say that to meet that deadline, the team will almost certainly rely on AI for coding, a practice that demands close oversight because of the high error rate in machine-generated code. Given DOGE’s rocky track record so far, an automated overhaul could introduce even more chaos. Some observers suspect those mistakes may be intentional. A school of critics argues that DOGE’s goal isn’t genuine reform but rather the destabilization of the SSA to pave the way for privatization. If so, the misfires and mayhem may be exactly what Musk’s team is aiming for. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The company confirmed the purchase of 111 Bitcoin at an average price of around $90,000 per coin. Overall, Semler now holds more than 3,300 Bitcoin, valuing its total crypto treasury at about $300 million. Measuring Bitcoin Yield Performance Semler highlighted that its Bitcoin acquisitions have contributed to a Bitcoin yield of 23.5% for shareholders so far this year. The Bitcoin yield metric compares the company’s Bitcoin holdings to its number of outstanding shares, helping to demonstrate how Bitcoin exposure per share has grown. “Semler Scientific uses BTC Yield as a [key performance indicator] to help assess the performance of its strategy of acquiring bitcoin in a manner Semler Scientific believes is accretive to stockholders,” the company explained. Since initiating this strategy in February, Semler has been aggressively building its Bitcoin position. Financing the Bitcoin Strategy The company stated it purchased its Bitcoin treasury for an average price close to $89,000 per coin. With Bitcoin currently trading at around $95,000, Semler’s investment has seen early gains. To support its Bitcoin acquisitions, Semler has financed the purchases by issuing roughly $125 million in new stock. Additionally, in January, the firm announced plans to raise another $75 million through a private offering of convertible senior notes. Semler Scientific primarily operates in the healthcare sector, developing diagnostic products that help detect chronic diseases. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings on the Rise Semler’s move follows a broader trend among corporations accumulating Bitcoin for their treasuries. Data shows public companies collectively hold approximately $71 billion worth of Bitcoin as of April 25. Leading the pack is Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which boasts a treasury valued at over $50 billion. During the week of April 14 alone, Strategy acquired an additional 6,556 Bitcoin at an average price of $84,785 per coin. Despite corporations building significant Bitcoin reserves, they still trail behind Bitcoin holdings managed by exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which control about $110 billion in Bitcoin. Semler’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy mirrors the growing institutional appetite for digital assets, signaling a continuing shift in corporate finance strategies.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-26 21:51:46

The cryptocurrency analyst from SwallowAcademy predicts Dogecoin (DOGE) will experience a 40% price decrease which will push its valuation to $0.09 before starting its rise. During its presale funding phase Mutuum Finance (MUTM) managed to secure $7.2 million in investment money while distributing 425 million tokens to a total of 9,100 token holders. The current price of the token stands at $0.025 during phase 4 but it aims to achieve a 140% gain until it reaches the public listing value of $0.06. This DeFi project’s systematic growth path proves itself to be a dominant competitor against Dogecoin in the crypto market space. Dogecoin’s Uncertain Path Dogecoin shows price volatility with trading at $0.1832 following its 103% volume increase that drove trading volume to 1.89 billion. The analyst Steph_iscrypto predicts a breakout based on a 129-day price downtrend which has historically led to 500% market runs. SwallowAcademy presents an unfavorable view of Dogecoin by warning about its impending collapse because hype serves as a crutch for its survival. JavonTM1 forecasts Dogecoin will reach $1.25 but each successive higher low points to susceptibility. The path of Dogecoin progresses without practical use and depends heavily on social opinion and potential ETF project initiatives. Structured investment alternatives feature low volatility which compels investors to choose projects using concrete financial instructions. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently operates within phase 4 while its token price remains at $0.025. The strong market interest led investors to purchase 9,100 tokens out of the 425 million available which generated $7.2 million in total sales. Current buyers participating in Phase 5 will obtain a 20% increase as the token value rises to $0.03 from the current $0.025 during phase 4. Tokenomics structure ensures investors will achieve a total 140% return after the assets list on exchanges for $0.06. An analysis predicts Mutuum Finance tokens will reach $3.50 after launch date which would result in a 13900% return on investment across phase 4. One starts with a $1,000 investment and will grow to become $140,000 during 2025. A Certik smart contract audit result will soon be made available through social channels to enhance trust in the platform. Mutuum’s DeFi Edge Mutuum Finance now permits the top 50 community members to receive bonus tokens as part of their extended platform support. Mutuum Finance runs with a stable lending system that combines peer-to-peer together with peer-to-contract lending due to its overcollateralized loan requirement and interest-generating capability of mtTokens. The platform directs revenue towards buying tokens to sustain market demand through its buy-and-distribute operation strategy. A rapidly selling ecosystem in Phase 4 serves as the main advantage for early platform investors to take an interest. The utility-based approach of MtToken outperforms Dogecoin because it draws investors whose main goal is dependable market expansion. Why Mutuum Outshines Dogecoin The predicted 500% rally for Dogecoin entices investors yet its speculative nature fails to match Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that utilizes mathematics to construct its DeFi system. The entry price of $0.025 during Phase 4 operates as a brief but vital moment to achieve 140% listing revenue growth and subsequent opportunities for up to 13,900% returns when the price reaches $3.50 in 2025.

In the ever-changing world of digital assets, Cardano (ADA) finds itself at an important stage, with its price action presently moving around the most important support levels. This moment, noted by attentive investors, shows that it is a decisive period for the token and is in contrast with the increased exposure and bullish sentiment surrounding both Avalanche (AVAX) and the emerging force that is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Cardano’s Balancing Act: Testing Key Support Cardano’s journey has never lacked drama for those who have always followed its developments and price movement. According to the latest live market data, ADA is presently trading around the $0.38 price mark–a zone that is watched closely by analysts and investors. While the project’s community and its technology remain strong, investors are still advised to be cautious. A drop below the $0.38 support could open the asset to an increased movement downwards. A sustained bounce here could also kickstart bullish optimism Experienced traders are looking at the best entry strategies ADA’s ability to hold ground here will likely shape the way the token will trade. Avalanche Builds Momentum Amid Investor Optimism AVAX Rises with Ecosystem Growth and Layer 1 Traction Avalanche (AVAX) has been seeing increased analyst attention thanks to its huge ecosystem advances and a clear rise in investor demands. According to live data, the token is trading around $26.07, seeing a jump of 9% in the past week, showing a big market interest. AVAX is benefitting from scalability and its high-speed transaction capabilities. Its growing ecosystem has been impressing developers and investors alike. Its position in the layer 1 space appears to favor the token. Smart investors see this action as evidence of Avalanche’s strong positioning within the broader crypto industry. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rare, High-Reward Opportunity Emerging While established projects continue to move close to important technical levels, experienced investors are currently scanning the market for opportunities where rewards could transform things. Enter MAGACOIN FINANCE–the new crypto star attracting lots of forward-thinking investors looking for early entry. Structured for long-term upside and designed for increased multiple growth.

It is a project that has been gaining attention from smart money, positioned well before listings, and has global access–a true rare quality in the crowded market of today. Knowledgeable traders recognize this upside before the rest of the market catches on, seeing that the entry window is still open, and the token is still trading below its breakout zone. Why Investors Are Jumping In Now For experienced investors, the mathematics is simple: the best opportunities are found where Visionary projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer the best entry position ahead of the herd.

As the market consolidates strength and early signals flash, these projects are standing out for their ability to anchor the next major crypto wave—and those positioning early could be preparing for a major run. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing Early-Stage Momentum That Can’t Be Ignored Projects that succeed over the long term always show early signs—measured growth, strong community expansion, and consistent delivery. MAGACOINFINANCE is hitting all of those marks right now. Wallet adoption is rising daily. Development milestones are hitting on time. And conversations around MAGACOINFINANCE are shifting from curiosity to conviction among serious early-stage investors. The project’s growth is happening quietly, strategically, and without artificial hype—exactly the way major success stories in crypto have unfolded before. MAGACOINFINANCE presents something even rarer: early-stage momentum with wide-open potential. Projects to Watch: Uniswap, Polkadot, and Litecoin Uniswap continues to lead decentralized exchange volume and remains a cornerstone of DeFi infrastructure. Polkadot is building the foundation for true multi-chain interoperability, with parachains offering developers new ways to scale and specialize blockchain use cases. Litecoin , often called the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, maintains a strong role in fast, low-fee peer-to-peer payments across a variety of exchanges and platforms. While all three of these projects are vital to the ecosystem, none offer the pure early-stage growth opportunity that MAGACOINFINANCE brings to the table today. Conclusion Crypto’s biggest success stories come from recognizing real growth before it becomes the mainstream narrative. Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP are laying strong foundations for the next cycle—but MAGACOINFINANCE.COM could be the hidden gem that delivers the kind of early-stage breakout gains that define generational wealth opportunities. The growth trajectory is being mapped now—the time to move is before the market fully catches on.

WLFI is the decentralized finance (DeFi) backed by President Donald Trump, and the collaboration will see it fast-track blockchain in the country. Strategic Alliance to Drive Crypto Innovation in Pakistan As per the LOI, WLFI will also drive the adoption of stablecoin and DeFi integration across Pakistan. This development comes ahead of the government’s plans to unveil a comprehensive blueprint on cryptocurrency legalization. Notably, the Pakistani author is looking to embrace digital assets and join the region’s financial innovation wave. The country seems to be positioning itself as one of the world’s rising crypto hubs. The LOI was signed at a meeting between WLFI and PCC, and a high-powered delegation represented both parties. On the part of the PCC, notable delegates included the Pakistan Finance Minister, the State Bank of Pakistan Governor, and the CEO of PCC, among others. The WLFI delegation had Zachary Witkoff, son of Steve Witkoff, the United States Special Envoy to the Middle East, Chase Herro, and Zachary Folkman. Crypto Momentum Leverages Pakistan’s Youth Population Speaking on the decision for the move, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb highlighted the country’s youthful population and technology as its greatest assets. He noted that the government is creating investment opportunities in the blockchain economy through such a partnership. Over 64% of Pakistan’s population is below the age of 30. According to data, the country has over 25 million active crypto users and approximately $300 billion worth of crypto transactions annually. Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, maintains that the collaboration with WLFI is strategic. According to Saqib, the move is to empower Pakistan’s youth and ensure the country is well-positioned to take advantage of the future of global finance. WLFI Expands Global Footprint This development signals the growing adoption of digital currency worldwide and reveals how WLFI has been active in the sector. Recently, it added 4.89 million SEI tokens, estimated at $0.775 million, to its holdings as part of a diversification move. Meanwhile, WLFI has secured $250 million from investors as part of its public token sale. The recent collaboration with Pakistan signals its push for global presence.

The company started with a portfolio of approximately 42,000 BTC, valued around $3 billion, and has secured $1.5 billion in funding from Tether and $900 million from SoftBank. Led by Jack Mallers of Strike, Twenty One Capital aims to compete directly with MicroStrategy by employing a strategy of issuing stock to buy Bitcoin, leveraging convertible debt and a reflexive flywheel model. The company plans to accumulate Bitcoin at scale through a global alliance and is preparing to go public via a SPAC backed by Cantor Fitzgerald. This move signals a shift in Bitcoin investment focus from grassroots to Wall Street, embracing Leveraged Bitcoin Equities (LBE) rather than spot ETFs. Analysts note that the success of this approach depends on maintaining a premium on the stock. The initiative represents a $4 billion head start over MicroStrategy's similar playbook and reflects growing institutional interest in Bitcoin acquisition vehicles.

With timelines flooded and Telegram groups buzzing, the meme coin arena is once again brimming with wild bets and unexpected winners. While big names like Floki Inu and ANDY have carved out their cult followings, there’s another contender stealthily sharpening its claws. One that hasn’t even hit exchanges yet but is already turning heads among presale hunters. Meet the mysterious whiskered wildcard everyone’s whispering about: Troller Cat ($TCAT). Still in whitelist-only mode, Trollercat isn’t just another meme project—it’s a community-powered movement wrapped in internet chaos, Ethereum smarts, and serious viral potential. If you’ve missed past rocket rides like DOGE or SHIB, this could be your redemption arc. Let’s dive into the top 8 meme coins clawing for attention in 2025. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) Troller Cat ($TCAT) is a meme coin born from the legendary art of trolling, and it proudly wears that identity. Rooted in Ethereum, this coin isn’t following meme culture; it’s creating it. With a rich narrative inspired by history’s greatest trolls, Troller Cat is out to claw its way to the top with clever marketing, meme mastery, and a rabidly engaged community. While most meme coins lean heavily on hype alone, Troller Cat brings layers of humor, lore, and strategic mischief into its branding. The Trollercat.com whitelist is currently open, and insiders are jumping in before this feline furball takes off. Rumors are circulating about deflationary mechanics tied to a play-to-earn Game Center, which could utilize ad revenue to buy back and burn tokens, thereby reducing the supply while increasing demand. Additionally, early adopters are speculating on lucrative staking rewards reserved for presale participants. Getting in early could be the difference between 10 times and 100 times. Why This Coin Made It to the List: The buzz around Troller Cat isn’t just empty noise—it’s coming from top-tier crypto groups, Twitter alpha threads, and FOMO-filled chats. With the whitelist still open, the chance to pounce before the crowd does is very real. This isn’t a coin you stumble across after it moons—it’s one to get into while the claws are still in stealth mode. 2. Floki Inu ($FLOKI) Floki Inu is no stranger to the spotlight. Born from the Shiba Inu and Dogecoin frenzy, it has since evolved into a powerhouse of its own. With a Viking-themed identity and a roadmap that includes a metaverse game (Valhalla), educational platform (Floki University), and DeFi utilities, Floki Inu offers more than just meme power—it delivers layered ecosystem potential. Why This Coin Made the List: Floki Inu combines meme appeal with a dedicated development team and tangible progress. The coin’s aggressive marketing, large community, and steady development mean it’s still on investors’ radars heading into 2025. 3. ANDY ($ANDY) ANDY is the meme coin that thrives on unpredictability. With a playful branding style and an anti-establishment vibe, it has built a cult following on social media. Its appeal lies in its raw meme energy, unfiltered communication, and ability to generate virality seemingly out of nowhere. Why This Coin Made It to the List: ANDY’s ability to punch above its weight in visibility makes it a consistent wildcard in the meme coin race. For investors who missed out on early DOGE or PEPE runs, ANDY still offers a shot at a meme-fueled pump. 4. Degen ($DEGEN) DEGEN lives up to its name—embracing the chaotic, high-risk-high-reward world of meme trading. It appeals to traders who wear their degeneracy as a badge of honor. With humor, sarcasm, and full embrace of crypto madness, DEGEN has secured a strong niche. Why This Coin Made It to the List: DEGEN’s branding and vibe resonate strongly with Gen-Z and millennial investors who love the thrill of the meme market. Its consistent engagement and wild price swings keep it relevant. 5. Dogs ($DOGS) Dogs is the no-nonsense, all-fun meme coin that rounds up every dog-themed token vibe into one community-driven project. It taps into nostalgia and meme history with a lighthearted approach, encouraging holders to bark, bite, and band together. Why This Coin Made It to the List: With meme projects, community is king—and Dogs has a loud, loyal pack. Its simplicity is part of the charm, making it an easy pick for meme coin explorers. 6. Apu Apustaja ($APU) Apu Apustaja is inspired by the wholesome and meme-worthy frog character from early internet culture. Beyond its comedic appeal, the coin has built a social impact narrative, funding community causes and tying humor to responsibility. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Apu stands out for blending memes with meaning. In a sea of chaos, its community-driven mission and nostalgic value offer unique appeal. 7. Gigachad ($GIGA) Gigachad leans into alpha energy like no other. With meme stylings focused on masculinity, dominance, and over-the-top aesthetics, it has carved out a niche for itself as the go-to coin for meme muscle. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Gigachad’s ability to go viral repeatedly, thanks to its meme fuel and edgy humor, keeps it in the conversation, especially among younger investors seeking high-octane hype. 8. Brett ($BRETT) Brett is a spin-off meme coin that taps into Bro culture and cartoon satire, leveraging internet absurdity to keep eyeballs glued. With high engagement on social media and a mascot that embodies Gen-Z energy, it’s a favorite among meme enthusiasts. Why This Coin Made the List: Its humor-driven vibe and creative memes make it a standout project. Brett’s brand personality helps it stand out from more generic meme clones. Conclusion: Based on the latest research, these are the top meme coins to buy before 2025: Troller Cat, Floki Inu, ANDY, Degen, Dogs, Apu Apustaja, Gigachad, and Brett. Each of these coins has its own style, story, and strategy—but only one is still in whitelist mode and stirring up real presale buzz. Troller Cat (TCAT) isn’t just purring—it’s prowling for dominance. With rumors of a deflationary Game Center, early staking rewards, and lore-fueled branding, this feline’s presale might be the most underestimated move in meme coin land. For those seeking the next potential 100x play, the Trollercat.com whitelist could be the opportunity to get in before the herd. Don’t get caught chasing the tail—join the pack while this cat’s still in stealth.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has shown a strong footing over the last 72 hours, even as the stock market and the traditionally stable bond market continue to exhibit erratic patterns. Bitcoin’s latest bull move has propelled the major digital currency’s total market capitalization above $1.87 trillion, and a 11.6% spike in weekly trading volume has been witnessed. The premier digital asset has risen strongly from its April lows of around $75,000 and is now 25% higher from that level, showing strong gains despite the overall gloomy outlook. Stocks Fall, Gold and BTC Rise Bitcoin has long been touted as a valid store of value alongside Gold. Its safe haven reputation has strengthened over time and was on display during the last few weeks as the world grappled with US President Donald Trump’s global tariff wars. Here is an interesting CNBC infographic: While both BTC and Gold have performed well this month, stocks continue to suffer due to ongoing uncertainty in traditional markets. In addition to the stock market, US government bonds are also facing some selling pressure. These U.S. Treasury securities have historically been considered among the safest investments, with steady interest rate returns. However, for the first time, these payments are expected to surpass the US government’s defense spending, which highlights the pressure on the American economy. There has been some selling in the bond market, which has alarmed economists in the US and around the world, and has stopped Trump from firing the head of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, following a dispute on interest rates. If the bonds fall further, we could face a major financial crunch immediately, as it indicates that trust in the US government is declining quickly. ETFs Record Major Inflows In addition to crypto exchange volumes, major US-based Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) also experienced significant net inflows after a long time. In total, the 11 ETFs had $381 million in net inflows on Monday and a massive $912 million on Tuesday, showing a sharp uptick in institutional activity. Altcoins Respond This string of positive developments has reignited the crypto market, and there are hopes that the long-term bull market of 2024-2025 will resume in the near future, following several months of a bearish outlook. The rest of the coin market also experienced healthy gains as it followed BTC into short-term bullish territory. Major gainers included Ethereum (ETH, 10%), Ripple (XRP, 8%), Solana (SOL, 8%), Dogecoin (DOGE, 11%), Cardano (ADA, 10%), and Sui (SUI, 23%).",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-26 22:25:42

Fed Rescinds Crypto Restrictions, Drawing Industry Praise On Friday, the Fed, along with the OCC and FDIC, officially rescinded guidance that discouraged banks from working with crypto firms. Given the Fed’s central role in banking oversight, this move has attracted industry-wide commendation.

The biggest success stories often start with small, calculated moves—and right now, a $750 investment could be the starting point for the next big narrative. As Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP continue their upward momentum, another name is starting to emerge alongside them: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . It’s not just about which assets are performing—it’s about which ones are still early enough to matter for those seeking exponential returns. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quickly Becoming a Top Early-Stage Focus The window to find undervalued projects is never open for long. And right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is attracting the kind of serious investor attention that suggests something bigger is brewing. This isn’t another flash-in-the-pan token. It’s a structured, steadily expanding project. Wallet activity is climbing. Community engagement is real. And most importantly, the project’s momentum is building organically—without relying on cheap tricks or forced marketing. When Bitcoin was early, when Solana was still overlooked, it was quiet traction like this that signaled bigger moves ahead. Other Noteworthy Names: Uniswap, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin Uniswap remains the leading decentralized exchange protocol, offering unmatched liquidity and consistent usage across DeFi applications. Polkadot continues to push interoperability forward, linking blockchains together through its innovative parachain model. Bitcoin Cash still finds support among those looking for fast, low-cost peer-to-peer transactions, staying true to crypto’s original payment ethos. Litecoin remains a reliable, battle-tested altcoin for simple, efficient transfers across global platforms. These projects provide solid infrastructure—but MAGACOINFINANCE still carries the rare advantage of being undiscovered by the masses. Final Word Can $750 turn into $1.5 million? History has shown it’s possible—but only for those who move early on projects with real growth engines.

After struggling under $87,000 for the past two months, the flagship cryptocurrency has finally returned above the $90,000 level. It remains unclear whether the recent BTC price surge is a continuation signal for the bull cycle. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that the investor sentiment might be turning positive again, meaning that the Bitcoin bull run could truly be back on. ‘ETF Printer Goes Brrr’ – Crypto Analyst In an April 25 post on the X platform, a crypto analyst with the pseudonym Maartunn shared an on-chain insight into the recent price rally experienced by the world’s largest cryptocurrency. According to the online pundit, the growing appetite of exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors in the past few days might have contributed to the Bitcoin bullish momentum. Related Reading: Litecoin Conviction Remains Strong: More Than 20% Of Supply Frozen Since 5+ Years The relevant indicator here is the Coinbase Premium Gap, which tracks the difference between the Bitcoin price on US-based Coinbase Pro (USD pair) and global Binance exchange (USDT pair). When this difference is positive, it implies BTC is trading at a higher price on Coinbase than on Binance. Typically, a positive Coinbase Premium Gap indicates that US-based investors are purchasing Bitcoin aggressively, especially through ETF issuers that use Coinbase as a liquidity provider. According to data from CryptoQuant, this metric’s 30-hour moving average has stayed positive for more than 265 straight hours (approximately 11 days). Maartunn noted that this is the fifth-longest streak since the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds started trading in January 2024. Typically, a consistently positive Coinbase Premium Gap suggests that US institutional players and large investors are willing to pay above-market prices for Bitcoin — specifically through regulated channels like ETFs or custodial platforms. This prolonged positive streak is historically correlated with positive price action and accumulation phases for the flagship cryptocurrency. Hence, the latest spike in the Coinbase Premium Gap could provide the adequate condition to sustain Bitcoin’s newly-found bullish momentum and perhaps catalyze the next significant breakout. Bitcoin Price At A Glance The price of Bitcoin has climbed above $95,000 for the first time since February, reflecting a 2% increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the premier cryptocurrency has surged by more than 13% in the past seven days.

As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem’s utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform’s adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market’s growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM’s all-time of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2025? Let’s dive into Sonic’s price predictions for 2025 and beyond. Overview Cryptocurrency Sonic Token S Price $0.5389 Market Cap $1.55B Trading Volume $160.99M Circulating Supply 3.17B S All-time High $1.03 on Jan 4, 2025 All-time Low $0.04356 on Jan 29, 2025 24-h High $0.5711 24-h Low $0.5273 Sonic (S) price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 7.71% 50-Day SMA $ 0.504028 14-Day RSI 55.78 Green Days 12/30 (40%) Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 65 (Greed) 200-Day SMA – Sonic price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Sonic shows a cautiously bullish trend on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts with price action testing key resistance Indicators like RSI and MACD support further upward movement while minor selling pressure suggests the need for caution A successful breakout above $0.55 could open the way toward $0.60 but traders should watch for resistance barriers Sonic (S) price analysis 1-day chart Sonic/USD 1-Day Chart Based on the 1-day chart on April 26, Sonic (SONIC) demonstrates a cautiously bullish structure. The price has broken slightly above the midline of the Bollinger Bands, suggesting an attempt to establish upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near 58, indicating growing buying pressure but not yet overbought conditions. Sonic is currently challenging the upper Bollinger Band, and a confirmed breakout above $0.55 could initiate a stronger rally toward $0.60. However, if the momentum weakens, the price might retest the midline support near $0.48. Overall, Sonic’s daily trend points toward cautious optimism with an eye on resistance levels. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart Sonic/USD 4-hour Chart Based on the 4-hour chart, Sonic (SONIC) exhibits moderate bullish momentum. The price is pressing against the Bollinger Bands’ upper boundary, suggesting heightened volatility and strong buying interest. The MACD histogram remains slightly positive, while the MACD and signal lines are close to a bullish crossover, which could reinforce short-term gains. However, the Balance of Power indicator is slightly negative, hinting at some underlying selling pressure. If buyers maintain momentum, Sonic could challenge resistance around $0.56. Conversely, failure to sustain above $0.54 may lead to a correction toward the $0.52 support region.

Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Sonic (SONIC) displays a cautiously bullish outlook. On the 1-day chart, SONIC tests the upper Bollinger Band with an RSI near 58, suggesting strong but not overextended buying momentum. The breakout attempt above $0.55 is crucial for sustained gains. Meanwhile, the 4-hour chart also shows SONIC trading near the upper band, with the MACD signaling a potential bullish crossover. However, the Balance of Power hints at minor selling pressure that could cap gains in the short term. If buying strength continues, SONIC could advance toward $0.60, but caution is warranted around resistance levels. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $1.03 price by 2025 and $6.99 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and an assessment of personal risk tolerance are essential steps for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $5 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $5.39. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic can approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $10. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast that prices could reach between $5.89 and $6.99, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

Hashdex, a Brazilian crypto asset manager, has launched the XRP spot ETF on Brazil’s B3 stock exchange. Brazil Leads With First-Ever Spot XRP ETF XRP is the industry’s fourth most valuable cryptocurrency with a $158 billion market cap as of this writing. But despite its dominance in the cryptosphere, regulatory obstacles have effectively hindered the launch of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) until now. Asset manager Hashdex has launched the Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Fundo de Índice, or Hashdex Nasdaq XRP FI, according to a press release from Valor Econômico. Hashdex received the sign-off from Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) to launch the XRP-based ETF back in February. After the approval by the country’s financial investments regulator, the fund entered into a pre-operational phase. The ETF was undergoing preparatory steps during this time and was not available for trading. Now trading on B3 under the ticker XRPH11, the fund will track the price of XRP across major crypto exchanges using the Nasdaq XRP Reference Price Index. The fund’s approval comes as issuers across the globe aim to address skyrocketing demand for crypto-focused investment products, amid a more friendly regulatory environment for these products and broadening acceptance among retail and institutional investors. Brazil: A Crypto Hub Brazil is notably Latin America’s largest economy, and the third-biggest economy in the Americas after the U.S. and Canada. It is also the region’s most prominent crypto player: Brazil has more Bitcoin ETFs than any other Latin American nation, and many of the country’s major banks offer investors some sort of digital asset exposure. Hashdex currently does not issue a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States, but in December received approval from the SEC for a combo ETF offering investors exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. J.P. Morgan analysts have predicted that, if approved, U.S.-listed funds could gobble between $4 billion and $8 billion in investor money. Spot Bitcoin funds have accrued over $38 billion in net inflows since going live in January 2024. Their Ethereum equivalents have attracted roughly $4 billion in net flows since trading began last July.",Cryptocurrency|News|Brazil|Ripple|USA|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-26 22:34:36

The prominent altcoin has been one of the major headliners of the current market cycle, increasing by 192.70% in the past year. However, certain market technical indicators show that SUI is likely headed for a correction following its most recent explosive gains. Related Reading: SUI Price Soars Despite Overbought RSI – Can The Rally Sustain? Elliott Wave Count Suggests Pullback Looms For SUI In an X post on Friday, X market analytics handle More Crypto Online shared an interesting analysis on the SUI market using the Elliott Wave theory — a technical tool that predicts future price trends by recognizing recurring wave-like patterns. According to the analysts at More Crypto Online, SUI’s bullish performance in the past week means the altcoin has surged to the 178.6% Fibonacci extension level around $3.71. This specified Fibonacci level represents a major technical milestone as it is a classic target area in Wave 3 in the Elliott Wave analysis. For context, the Elliott Wave theory postulates that price movements occur in five recurring wave patterns. Wave 3 is usually regarded as the strongest and longest wave in a bullish trend. It is a wave of confirmation indicating a robust market participation. Based on the current wave count in the SUI market, the altcoin is completing the final stages of Wave 3, having surpassed the minimum Fibonacci extension level of 138%. As expected, signs of waning demand are beginning to set in, as indicated by a 5.7% price retracement in the past day. More Crypto Online predicts Wave 4 — a corrective price phase may now be imminent. SUI is expected to experience a price pullback with initial support zone set at $3.27. Notably, a decisive price break below this level would confirm the end of Wave 3 and the beginning of Wave 4. Furthermore, a deeper market support lies between $2.95 and $2.75, which represents the 38.2% – 50% Fibonacci retracement zone of the Wave 3 move. More Crypto Online views this price region as the support target zone for a healthy Wave 4 correction. Therefore, market bulls must hold this price zone to retain SUI’s bullish structure and set the stage for a potential Wave 5 breakout. SUI Price Outlook At press time, SUI trades at $3.58 following an 8.85% overall gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the coin’s daily trading volume is up by 18.64% and valued at $3.44 billion. If SUI’s price retracement continues, the altcoin is expected to trigger Wave 4 of its current wave cycle, indicating a potential 50% correction lies ahead. However, if bullish momentum remains intact, SUI could rise to around the 200% Fibonacci extension level, around $3.99, which represents the coin’s next major resistance.

On Thursday, the South Korean crypto exchange giant Bithumb announced it was listing XYO, the native token of the XYO Network. The XYO Network aims to process any type of decentralized data. Explains the project’s website , “Encompassing both a network and protocol, XYO can be used for aggregating, verifying, organizing, and utilizing decentralized data from any hardware node capable of running XYO-enabled software or firmware. XYO’s defining premise is decentralized verification, allowing network devices to verify the data flowing into the network’s databases by acting as witnesses for one another, strengthening the veracity of data received. Simple, accessible organization then allows this data to be put to use quickly and efficiently.” Earlier this month, the project announced it would be migrating its network to a new layer-1 chain focused on DePIN. To help facilitate that move, the XYO Network is also rolling out a new layer-1 native token, XL1, and will operate with a dual-token model going forward. The original XYO token will stay on Ethereum ( ETH ) and act “as an anchor to regulate the flow of XL1 into its native blockchain,” according to the project . XYO is trading at $0.0154 at time of writing. The 278th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is also up by more than 71% in the past week.

Today, Bitcoin (BTC) , Solana (SOL) , and XRP remain strong across major exchanges—but sharp investors are expanding their focus toward rising early-stage projects. Among the most discussed right now is MAGACOINFINANCE —an asset building real traction ahead of broader market visibility. Early accumulation phases like this often define the top winners of the next cycle. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing Strong ROI Potential Momentum around MAGACOINFINANCE is growing steadily—driven by real wallet expansion, organic community building, and strategic rollout timing. Based on analyst tracking of stealth-phase growth, projections now suggest MAGACOINFINANCE could deliver a potential upside as listings expand and broader exposure kicks in. This rare positioning is what smart investors target before prices adjust to reflect full market interest. Other Noteworthy Movers: XRP, SOL, KAS, and OP XRP continues solidifying its dominance in digital payments and global remittance channels. Solana (SOL) leads innovation with high-speed, low-cost decentralized finance solutions. Kaspa (KAS) is redefining blockchain scalability with blockDAG technology. Optimism (OP) scales Ethereum infrastructure through Layer-2 efficiency and performance. While these assets are already well-integrated, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the stealth-phase potential where outsized returns are still in reach for early movers. Final Word Crypto rewards those who spot strength before the headlines do. While Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP continue reinforcing their place in the ecosystem, MAGACOINFINANCE is setting up quietly—and those positioned now could be in for some of 2025’s biggest rewards.

In the midst of this, a new project is building serious momentum under the radar, MAGACOINFINANCE . A token that many early investors are now ranking among their top early-stage picks for 2025. The combination of timing, structure, and momentum is creating a setup too compelling to ignore. Why MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining strategic attention The bonus window is still open: Early participants have a short window to maximize their entry before public listings arrive. Momentum is quietly accelerating: Early communities are adding MAGACOINFINANCE to watchlists and positioning early. Pre-listing access remains rare: True low-exposure opportunities like this don’t stay hidden for long. Smart timing is key: This is the exact phase where major crypto stories quietly begin. MAGACOINFINANCE is showing strong growth potential With structured rollout strategies and rising early interest, MAGACOINFINANCE is being flagged by analysts as one of the most promising early-stage projects. Current projections place MAGACOINFINANCE among assets with upswing potential , based on its early phase traction, structural design, and upcoming exposure. Why LINK, DOT, MATIC, and ADA can’t match this early positioning Chainlink (LINK) , Polkadot (DOT) , Polygon (MATIC) , and Cardano (ADA) are key players, but their early-stage moments are behind them. MAGACOINFINANCE is just getting started—where strategic entries still have room for expansion and true scalability. Final thoughts on MAGACOINFINANCE The biggest moves in crypto were made before they became headlines. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP rewarded early conviction. Today, MAGACOINFINANCE is offering the same rare timing opportunity—limited access, growing strength, and strong projected upside. This is the type of early positioning smart investors wait for.

In the crypto market two projects are fighting for leadership yet only one will lead the market in 2025. Mutuum Finance introduces its ongoing phase 4 for $0.025 entry which guarantees a 140% profit when MUTM launches. The steady increase of Cardano depends on its continuous ecosystem development. The dual forces of DeFi innovation and blockchain veteran experience will create a dramatic competition for the year 2025. Cardano’s Methodical March ADA has demonstrated strong market gains by lifting its price 14.99% to $0.69 throughout the week. The mass purchase of millions of tokens by Whale wallets demonstrates their conviction about its future prospects. Two technical indicators show bullish momentum for the market because the 1.06 long-to-short ratio exists alongside an RSI that keeps rising to 57. The combination of BitcoinOS security measures with Bitcoin staking capabilities establishes conditions to attract billions in assets. The systematic engineering approach of Cardano based on peer-reviewed standards counts as a major constraint to its immediate market performance. Modern whales conducted a buy of 180 million tokens which indicates potential profit returns. Cardano faces the possibility of trailing behind in its market ascent toward $0.80 despite analyst predictions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates at full speed as it pushes aggressively through its presale process. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Power The presale stage of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently exists in stage 4 of its 11-phase framework where tokens are sold at $0.025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts intense buyer demand as it collects $7.2 million from 9,100 investors through its presale launch. Phase 5 of the sale will occur soon as the current pricing will increase by 20% to $0.03 thus providing instant profits to early buyers. Tokenomics guarantees an initial pricing at $0.06 which provides 140% return during launch. Directed analysis indicates the launch value will skyrocket to $2.50 and result in a 9,900% growth over current market value. The team is finalizing a Certik audit of its smart contracts, with results soon to be shared on socials, boosting trust. This momentum positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a DeFi frontrunner. Innovative Lending Model One key decentralized feature of MUTM provides a unique framework for loans along with the accruing interest system that mtTokens generate from fund deposits which serves as passive income sources. Through the buy-and-distribute system platform revenue provides repurchased tokens to participants as rewards that occur while market demand remains unaltered. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an updated tracking system which awards additional tokens to the top 50 token owners to strengthen their loyalty together with their rank positions. Mutuum Finance displays different operational features than the extensive blockchain development structure of Cardano. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gains rapid growth in 2025 because investors choose its return on investment offerings and financial strategy which builds community engagement. Race to the Top Mutuum Finance (MUTM) surpasses Cardano (ADA) in terms of fast presale completion as investors easily find profitable ways to invest. The price stability of Cardano maintains itself through ongoing platform development although the network expands its ecosystem continually. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s $0.025 entry, 140% launch profit, and potential $2.50 post-launch value offer unmatched upside. Those seeking 2025’s top-performing asset should move swiftly since Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will finish its phase 4 within this year.

Interestingly, Ethereum has held its ground firmly, supported by a clean uptrend that began after the sharp recovery from $1,550 that kicked off on Tuesday. Related Reading: Ethereum To Hit $5k Before Its 10th Birthday, Justin Sun Says As it stands, the Ethereum price is at an important technical phase after retesting the $1,799 resistance level and pulling back into its final intraday support zone. A fresh push above $1,800 could open the door to $1,840 and beyond, whereas deeper retracements would test three important zones. Ethereum Turns Resistance Levels Into Support Ethereum’s recent rally has seen it break past three notable resistance levels that have rejected its price action for most of April. Interestingly, these resistance levels are located at $1,590, $1,654, and $1,703, as indicated by a technical analysis of Ethereum’s price action on the hourly candlestick timeframe chart on the TradingView platform. Following these breakouts, Ethereum continued to push upward with momentum until it encountered a tougher ceiling near the $1,800 mark. After briefly tapping into this zone, the price experienced a minor rejection, retracing back towards $1,730 before finding support and beginning another gradual climb. As it stands, the resistance at $1,800 is the next level to beat in the hopes of a close above $2,000 before the end of April. Nonetheless, even if Ethereum does not reach this level, a bullish sentiment will still be in place if it manages to hold above the broken resistances, which have now turned to support on the H1 timeframe. Ethereum Could Still Be Bullish Unless $1,654 Breaks Ethereum’s outlook remains bullish as long as the newly reclaimed levels at $1,590, $1,654, and $1,703 continue to act as reliable support zones. The first zone, positioned at $1,703, represents a short-term hourly support level. This area may attract early entries, but it is high-risk and prone to breaking easily. Beneath that lies the more structurally significant support at $1,654, which is also evident on the 4-hour chart. This level is a medium-risk zone, characterized by a cleaner and sound area of demand. It has a higher probability of initiating a bounce if tested, and its preservation is important in maintaining a short-term bullish bias for Ethereum. The strongest support level is at $1,590 and is somewhat low-risk for reentry. It has the most favorable risk-to-reward ratio, where smart money traders are likely to accumulate. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Heating Up’ – Address Activity Jumps Nearly 10% In 2 Days As long as Ethereum stays above $1,703, the current uptrend remains valid. The bullish bias remains intact unless there’s a confirmed break below $1,654. A drop below the $1,654 support would shift the short-term outlook to neutral or bearish. On the other hand, a successful close above $1,800 could cascade toward the next target around $1,840 or even higher.

In 2025, the market is hotter than ever, with new coins emerging every day. However, even with all the noise surrounding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the many altcoins, one thing is crystal clear: many missed the boat on some of the biggest crypto opportunities. Bitcoin’s price is through the roof, and Ethereum’s smart contracts are reshaping industries. But here’s the catch—these opportunities are long gone. Now, the race is on for the next breakout star. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), the cryptocurrency that might just be the next big thing to revolutionize the space. While Bitcoin once looked like the holy grail for early adopters, its massive price tag today makes it less accessible for new users. Ethereum’s gas fees? Don’t get me started. What if there was a new cryptocurrency that could solve the problems these older coins couldn’t? What if it’s still affordable to jump in now, before it becomes the next multi-billion-dollar success story? With Qubetics, that’s exactly what’s on the table. The Missed Opportunity: Bitcoin’s Meteoric Rise Looking back at Bitcoin, it’s hard not to feel a little bit of regret. Bitcoin was once just a quirky, niche project that not many folks took seriously. Fast forward a decade, and it’s the king of cryptocurrencies. Those who jumped in early have seen returns so wild that it’s almost hard to believe. But for the rest, Bitcoin’s skyrocketing price means that entering the game now feels like an impossible task. Let’s face it: Bitcoin’s rise was a missed opportunity for many. But here’s the kicker—it’s not too late to catch the next big wave. Bitcoin might have been the first, but that doesn’t mean it’s the only chance to make it big in crypto. The space is constantly evolving, and new players are stepping up. Qubetics is one of them, and right now, it’s in presale, meaning there’s still time to get in on the ground floor. Bitcoin is often referred to as the “most popular cryptocurrency,” and for good reason. It’s the leader in terms of market cap and adoption, but its limitations are clear. High transaction costs, slow processing times, and an energy-hungry proof-of-work mechanism make Bitcoin’s future uncertain in the face of more scalable and eco-friendly alternatives. That’s where Qubetics comes into play. Why Qubetics is the New Rising Star of the Crypto Space The most popular cryptocurrency of 2025 might not be the one you think. Sure, Bitcoin and Ethereum are still heavyweights, but the next wave of crypto adoption is already underway, and Qubetics is leading the charge. Why? Because it’s addressing the real-life problems that current cryptocurrencies are struggling with. Qubetics has introduced a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet that allows users to manage assets across different blockchain networks, offering true decentralized control. Unlike traditional custodial wallets that hold your assets for you, Qubetics lets users stay in control of their own funds. And with the ability to interact with multiple chains, it’s bridging gaps that Bitcoin and Ethereum have failed to address. Real-Life Applications of Qubetics: A Game-Changer for Businesses, Professionals, and Individuals Let’s talk about how Qubetics could change lives—real lives. Imagine you’re a small business owner looking to accept payments in cryptocurrency. You don’t want the hassle of paying crazy high fees to process payments through Ethereum or Bitcoin. With Qubetics, you could accept payments on multiple blockchains with low fees, all while maintaining full control over your funds. Now, picture a professional freelancer who works with clients from all over the world. With Qubetics, they can easily send and receive payments across different networks, without worrying about excessive transaction costs or delays. That’s huge for anyone working in the gig economy or running a digital business. Whether you’re a designer, a consultant, or a digital marketer, Qubetics makes it easy to manage payments securely and efficiently. And let’s not forget about everyday users. The Qubetics wallet allows for seamless transactions across multiple blockchains, meaning users can send crypto with ease, whether it’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other assets. All of this comes with a level of security that most other wallets can’t provide. The Qubetics Presale: Get in Before It’s Too Late So, how can you take advantage of this opportunity? Well, the Qubetics presale is in full swing, and right now, you can purchase $TICS tokens for just $0.1902 per token in the 31st stage. Over 25,200 holders have already jumped in, raising more than $16.4 million. Analysts are predicting massive returns once the crypto presale ends and the token hits exchanges. Some are even predicting that the price could hit $1, $5, or even $15 after the mainnet launch. That’s a potential return of over 7,000% from the presale price! Here’s a breakdown of the price predictions: $TICS at $1 after the presale = 425% ROI $TICS at $5 after the presale = 2527% ROI $TICS at $15 after mainnet launch = 7783% ROI This is an opportunity that won’t last long. With the presale in its final stages, now’s the time to act if you want to get in before it’s too late. What’s Next for Qubetics? Analysts are extremely bullish on Qubetics, and it’s easy to see why. With a clear roadmap, an innovative multi-chain wallet, and a rapidly growing community, Qubetics is poised to make a major impact in the crypto space. Its presale success speaks volumes about the excitement and interest surrounding the project. The Qubetics community continues to grow, and as the mainnet launch approaches, the price of $TICS is expected to soar. If you missed the boat with Bitcoin or Ethereum, now’s your chance to get in early on the next big cryptocurrency. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Next Most Popular Cryptocurrency—Qubetics Looking back at the rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum, it’s easy to feel a little regretful for not getting in early. These coins were the most popular cryptocurrency of their time, and their meteoric rise made fortunes for many. But here’s the thing—just because you missed the boat on Bitcoin doesn’t mean you’re out of luck. Qubetics ($TICS) is the next big opportunity in crypto, and it’s still in presale, making it a perfect chance to get in before it becomes the next most popular cryptocurrency. With its innovative Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, low fees, and massive potential for growth, Qubetics has all the makings of a breakout star. Analysts are predicting huge returns, and with the presale gaining momentum, the time to act is now. If you missed out on Bitcoin or Ethereum, don’t let this opportunity pass you by.

Right now, that window may be opening across several major names—including MAGACOINFINANCE.COM , XRP , Solana , and Bitcoin —all of which are building undeniable momentum as 2025 approaches. In markets like these, small moves can turn into major outcomes—and the clock is ticking for those looking to position themselves before the next surge hits. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Speed—and Serious Investors Are Noticing Momentum in crypto isn’t random. It’s built on clear signals: growing wallet numbers, consistent project updates, expanding community support, and increased mentions across credible trader circles. Right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is showing all of those signals—and it’s doing so faster than most new tokens even hope to. It’s clear, it’s early, and the foundation being built is earning attention from seasoned investors who know what early-stage traction looks like. No gimmicks. No overhype. Just execution and a community that’s growing stronger with every new development. Why XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin Are Still Leading Conversations XRP has returned as a serious force in global payments, now with legal clarity boosting its ability to integrate with financial institutions. As cross-border remittance demand grows, XRP’s value proposition becomes even more critical. Solana remains unmatched in transaction speed and network scalability. With NFT ecosystems, gaming platforms, and real-world integrations accelerating, it continues to be a key player in every major crypto growth discussion. Bitcoin , the foundation of the digital asset class, keeps asserting its dominance. Institutions continue to build exposure, and retail traders still treat it as the safest macro bet in crypto. Other Rising Players: NEAR Protocol, Chainlink, Ethereum, and Aave NEAR Protocol continues to make waves with its user-friendly blockchain model, onboarding developers who are focused on seamless dApp creation. Chainlink remains a pillar of decentralized data. Its oracles power a huge segment of DePIN and on-chain asset management, keeping it absolutely essential to the ecosystem. Ethereum is the backbone of innovation. Despite Layer-2 competition, its centrality to smart contracts and DeFi ensures its continued relevance for the foreseeable future. Aave is leading decentralized lending and liquidity platforms, offering secure, innovative tools for both retail and institutional DeFi users. Each is valuable—but none are in the early-stage growth zone where MAGACOINFINANCE now thrives. Final Word $8,000 in 20 days? Crypto history shows that fast momentum can spark fast outcomes—but only for those positioned early. With MAGACOINFINANCE.COM , XRP , Solana , and Bitcoin all gaining strength, the smartest move might be stepping into the right assets before the next leg up. The momentum is already here.

After weeks of consolidation and choppy price action, POL has decisively moved above the pattern’s resistance line, breathing life back into its short-term outlook. The current momentum suggests that bulls may have their eyes set on the next key target at $0.31. With improving sentiment and technical indicators flashing bullish signals, POL appears poised to extend its recovery if buyers can sustain the pressure. From Consolidation To Acceleration: Polygon Phase Shifts In a recent tweet, Whales_Crypto_Trading highlighted a significant technical move on POL’s chart. Polygon is currently breaking above the upper boundary of a broadening wedge on the daily timeframe, which is usually a bullish signal that points to rising volatility and potential trend reversal. This pattern, widely watched by technical traders, suggests that POL may be gearing up for a sustained upside push. Related Reading: Nearly All POL Holders At A Loss—What Does It Mean For The Market? The analyst further noted that if momentum continues to build, POL could see a notable move toward the $0.52 mark. This level represents a midterm projection based on the size of the breakout from the wedge formation. A 2x gain from current levels would attract bullish attention and position POL back in line with previous consolidation zones. With the breakout accompanied by improving sentiment and growing volume, Polygon appears to be setting the stage for a stronger rally. Presently, speculations are whether bulls can maintain the price above the breakout level and continue defending short-term support. If that happens, POL’s next chapter could be defined by renewed momentum and wider investor interest. Measured Moves And Extended Targets While $0.31 stands as the immediate upside target following the breakout, the broadening wedge pattern hints that the Polygon rally may not stop there. Breakouts from such structures often extend beyond initial resistance zones, especially when supported by strong volume and positive momentum indicators. Related Reading: Polygon Q4 Digest: Agglayer Testnet Launch Drives 30% Spike In POL Market Cap If bullish pressure remains steady, the next areas to watch would be near $0.44 and $0.52, both of which align with previous reaction points and Fibonacci extensions. These levels could act as zones where short-term traders might take profits, but they also offer opportunities for the trend to build new higher highs. Despite the upward momentum surrounding POL’s breakout, risks still linger beneath the surface. One major concern is the possibility of a false breakout if the price fails to hold above the $0.31 mark, attracting strong selling pressure and trapping late buyers. This would invalidate the breakout and may trigger a swift pullback toward lower support levels.

The premier cryptocurrency seems to be approaching the weekend with the same — if not greater — momentum after crossing $95,000 on Friday, April 25th. Who Is Really Behind The BTC Rally? In a new post on the X platform, on-chain analyst IT Tech took a deep dive into the recent Bitcoin price rally, identifying the catalysts for the run from around $74,000 to $95,000. According to a crypto pundit, recent blockchain data shows there has been a clear rotation of capital in the past month. This analysis revolves around the activity of various classes of Bitcoin investors (based on the time spent holding their coins). According to data from IntoTheBlock, most activity has unsurprisingly come from the traders (or short-term holders), who have increased their balance by nearly 19% in the past 30 days. IT Tech noted that these traders, true to their reactive nature and driven by FOMO (fear of missing out), have been aggressively buying BTC since its price fell to around $74,000. At the same time, the short-term traders have not taken their foot off the gas with the Bitcoin price now dancing above $95,000. Furthermore, long-term holders seem to have stopped shaving off their holdings in recent weeks, removing the “major overhead pressure” on the Bitcoin price. According to data from IntoTheBlock, the balance of BTC long-term holders has grown by at least 0.3% in the last 30 days. Finally, IT Tech highlighted an investor cohort dubbed “Cruisers,” with Bitcoin holdings aged between 1 to 12 months. Considering that their balance declined by 4.4% in the past month, the on-chain analyst mentioned these investors are either maturing into “ Hodlers ” or taking profit. IT Tech concluded that the Bitcoin price could be entering a speculative bullish phase characterized by substantial short-term capital inflows and long-term stability. However, the analyst warned about the dominance of the short-term hands. Given their reactive nature, highly volatile periods are historically correlated with the dominance of short-term holders. This means that there might be high volatility in the future of the Bitcoin market. In any case, IT Tech believes the Bitcoin price is yet to reach the local top .

With its recent break in tight price action, a crypto analyst believes that XRP could be preparing to surge above $8, marking a new ATH for the top altcoin. XRP Price Aims For $8 Target In Coming Months After months of constrained price action, the XRP price has finally broken out of a descending consolidation pattern—a bullish signal that the market has been eagerly awaiting. Following this breakout, XRP is now eyeing a potential rally toward the $8.08 mark. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Heating Up’ – Address Activity Jumps Nearly 10% In 2 Days Delving deeper into the technical chart analysis published by TradingView crypto analyst Master Ananda, XRP is now comfortably trading above crucial Moving Averages (MA), including the EMA9, EMA10, EMA20, EMA25, EMA50, and most importantly, the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The Exponential Moving Averages indicate a short to medium-term bullishness for XRP. At the same time, the 200-day SMA is the most critical and long-term bullish signal. Key Fibonacci Extension levels confirm the breakout from the descending consolidation pattern. In alignment with its projected rise to $8.08, XRP is expected to surge past three critical price targets: the 1.618 Fib at $4.5, the 2.618 Fib around $6.29 and finally, the 3.618 Fib, which corresponds with the $8.08 price level. Notably, a surge to $8.08 would represent more than double XRP’s current all-time high of $3.84, marking a 1,380% increase from its current market value. The analyst’s chart highlights a clear breakout trajectory, emphasizing a steady upward pace with the reversal point already confirmed. For its short-term price targets, Master Ananda has shared four key Fibonacci Extension levels: the 0.382 Fib at $2.29, the 0.5 Fib at $2.5, the 0.618 Fib at $2.71, and finally, the 0.786 Fib at $3.01. Notably, the analyst has also highlighted the $3.4 level as a “high” resistance level for XRP. Breaking above this price would be another huge bullish confirmation that XRP can move toward the $8.08 projected target. Analyst: Exercise Patience Ahead Of Surge Despite his bullish stance on XRP’s future price outlook, Master Ananda has advised investors and traders to remain patient and exercise caution. While XRP is showing clear signs of growth, it’s important to note that this projected surge will not happen overnight. The TradingView analyst has stated that XRP’s journey toward the price range between $6-$8 would span several months, not just weeks, as the market gradually stabilizes and bullish momentum continues to build. Related Reading: Ethereum To Hit $5k Before Its 10th Birthday, Justin Sun Says Although market volatility could still test XRP’s price action, the breakout from the SMA200 confirms that the cryptocurrency has entered a multi-month bullish phase. As a result, Master Ananda has asserted that XRP’s bullish growth in the long term is certain, with traders expected to take profits once its price reaches a peak.

We need to turn on the lights and build some walkways over the lava pit,” Peirce said at the SEC “Know Your Custodian” roundtable event on April 25. The lava is crypto, says Peirce Peirce explained that SEC registrants are forced to approach crypto-related activities like “the floor is lava,” where the aim is to jump from one piece of furniture to the next without touching the ground, except here, touching crypto directly is the lava. “A D.C. version of this game is our regulatory approach to crypto assets, and crypto asset custody in particular,” she said. Peirce said that, much like in the game, firms wanting to engage with crypto must avoid directly holding it due to unclear regulatory rules. “To engage in crypto-related activities, SEC-registrants have had to hop from one poorly illuminated regulatory space to the next, all while ensuring that they never touch any crypto asset,” Peirce said. Source: US Securities and Exchange Commission Peirce said that investment advisers are often unsure which crypto assets qualify as securities, what entities count as qualified custodians, and whether “exercising staking or voting rights” could trigger custody violations. “The twist in the regulatory version is that it is largely played in the dark: burning legal lava and no lamps to illuminate the way.” Peirce also said that a broker or ATS that cannot custody or manage crypto assets will struggle to facilitate trading, making it unlikely for a “robust market” to develop. Echoing a similar sentiment, SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said at the event that as more SEC registrants work with crypto assets, it’s essential that they have access to custodial options that meet legal and regulatory requirements. Uyeda said the agency should consider letting advisers use “state-chartered limited-purpose trust companies” with the authority to hold crypto assets as qualified custodians. Related: Blockchain needs regulation, scalability to close AI hiring gap Meanwhile, the recently sworn-in chair of the SEC, Paul Atkins, said that he expected “huge benefits” from blockchain technology through efficiency, risk mitigation, transparency, and cutting costs. He reiterated that among his goals at the SEC would be to facilitate “clear regulatory rules of the road” for digital assets, hinting that the agency under former chair Gary Gensler had contributed to market and regulatory uncertainty. “I look forward to engaging with market participants and working with colleagues in President Trump’s administration and Congress to establish a rational fit-for-purpose framework for crypto assets,” said Atkins.

While the price of BTC continues to hold above the critical $94,000 level, the premier cryptocurrency seems to be losing some momentum. Unsurprisingly, investors appear to be increasingly confident in the promise of this recent rally, as significant amounts of BTC continue to make their way off major centralized exchanges over the past few days. Here’s how much investors have moved in the past few days. Over 35,000 BTC Move Out Of Coinbase And Binance In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, crypto analyst João Wedson revealed that Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has seen increased activity over the past few days. The exchange netflow data shows that huge amounts of Bitcoin have been withdrawn from the platform in recent days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees 4th Dip in Funding Rates This Year — What Does This Mean For BTC? According to CryptoQuant data, a total of 27,750 BTC (worth $2.63 billion at current price) was moved out of Binance on Friday, April 25. This latest round of withdrawals represents the third-largest net outflow in the centralized exchange’s history. The movement of significant crypto amounts from exchanges, which offer services like selling to non-custodial wallets, suggests a potential shift in investor sentiment and strategy. Large exchange outflows often signal increased confidence of holders in the long-term potential of an asset. Wedson noted that the recent outflows do not guarantee a price rally for Bitcoin, but they do signal strong institutional activity, which is often a precursor for major volatility. Citing China’s crypto ban in 2021, the crypto analyst highlighted how massive exchange outflows didn’t prevent the dump. At the same time, Wedson mentioned that the continuous Bitcoin outflows over several days, like during the FTX collapse, preceded a price bottom and the eventual market recovery. Ultimately, the online pundit hinted at paying close attention to the overall trend of the exchange netflow rather than a single-day activity. Similarly, more than 7,000 BTC (worth approximately $66.5 million) have made their way out of the Coinbase exchange. According to the CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha, this negative exchange netflow could be an indicator of increased institutional activity, as Coinbase is known as the primary crypto vendor for US-based institutions. Taha said: These large outflows typically suggest accumulation by institutions or large investors, potentially signaling bullish sentiment. The analyst outlined that if the dwindling exchange reserves correlate with an increased spot demand or ETF inflows, a supply squeeze could be on the horizon, potentially pushing the price to the upside. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just beneath $95,200, reflecting an almost 2% increase in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Is The XRP Price Rally Over At $2.22?

Jacobs said geopolitical tensions and growing global uncertainty are accelerating diversification strategies among central banks in different countries. He pointed to a long-term trend in which nations are reducing their reliance on dollar reserves in favor of assets such as gold and, increasingly, bitcoin. ”This whole diversification away from traditional assets towards gold and cryptocurrencies [...] started three to four years ago,” Jacobs explained, adding that the recent fragmentation of the world has increased the desire for alternative means of saving. The BlackRock representative mentioned growing concerns about the freezing in the West of $300 billion in assets of the Russian central bank. In his view, such events have forced countries such as China to rethink their reserve strategies. Geopolitical fragmentation as a defining force During the interview, Jacobs said that BlackRock has identified multipolarity as a key force that will influence global markets over the next few decades: ”We've really identified geopolitical fragmentation as a key force that will be a global driver over the next few decades.” He noted that this environment is fueling demand for non-correlated stock market assets, with bitcoin increasingly seen alongside gold as a safe haven asset. ”We've seen significant inflows into gold ETFs, we've seen significant inflows into bitcoin. And it's all because people are looking for assets with independent market behavior,” Jacobs said. Bitcoin is separating from the stock market Notably, Jacobs is not the only one to emphasize bitcoin's declining correlation with U.S. stocks. Several analysts have also noted that the first cryptocurrency is starting to separate from the US stock market. On April 22, Alex Svanevik, co-founder and CEO of crypto platform Nansen, stated that the bitcoin price is showing growing maturity as a global asset, becoming ”less Nasdaq and more like gold.” He added that bitcoin has proven ”remarkably resilient” in the face of the trade war compared to altcoins and indices like the S&P 500, although it remains vulnerable to economic recession fears. Echoing that view, QCP Capital in an April 21 report shared gold's fame as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. ”With stock markets ending last week in the red, continuing April's decline, the narrative of bitcoin as a protective asset or inflation hedging tool is gaining traction again. If this momentum continues, it could provide further impetus for institutional bitcoin investment,” summarizes QCP Capital.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-27 05:08:48

Up more than 11% over the last seven days and with a market cap hovering just under $1.88 trillion, BTC has social media ablaze with shouts of $100K+ price predictions, even as some seasoned voices warn retail traders to tread carefully. $103K on the Cards Analyst Titan of Crypto ignited the bullish case, claiming a “bull flag” breakout is underway, and predicting a short-term move to $103,000 in a post on X. The asset’s recent price movement coincided with substantial accumulation by large investors. According to Santiment, wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC have been aggressively adding to their positions, with Bitcoin advocate Kyle Chassé calling it “THE STRONGEST SIGNAL IN THE GAME!!!” Santiment also revealed that market sentiment has reached its most greed-dominated level since November 2024, when the flagship cryptocurrency last peaked before correcting 13%. The analytics platform suggested whales were ready to mop up any BTC offloaded by profit-seeking retail traders in this period, potentially giving the asset a leg up past $100,000: “If they sell here because they think we are seeing a top, whales would likely scoop up those coins and potentially push Bitcoin above $100K in the next 1-2 weeks.” Some prominent market watchers have also highlighted key technical developments, including Daan Crypto Trades, who observed Bitcoin’s resilience at key Fibonacci levels. “$BTC Strong bounce and continuation from the .382 Fibonacci Retracement level,” he stated, expressing his fondness for “higher timeframe trends.” Bull Cycle Incoming? Adding to the narrative, Michaël van de Poppe suggested the market might be entering a major bull cycle. He cited a chart by TechDev_52 showing that BTC has been in its longest bear run, lasting four years, and implied a reverse cycle was imminent. “We’re about to start the biggest bull cycle ever,” the crypto investor wrote. However, the Santiment team offered a more cautious perspective, noting that excessive crowd greed might lead to a local top formation, while more measured behavior could allow BTC to maintain its divergence from traditional markets like the S&P 500. With its dominance holding at 61.2% and institutional interest remaining strong, the cryptocurrency’s next move could set the tone for the rest of the digital asset market in the next week.

Source: X.com As illustrated in the chart, Bitcoin is currently in the “Transition” range, where BTC accumulation occurs. Once it breaks into the “Acceleration” zone, the crypto asset enters the rally's 33% to 66% range , progressively targeting $106,000, $130,000, and $163,000 over the next few months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 predicted BTC’s price target could be as high as $200,000 in 2025. The prediction is based on ""Bitcoin power curve time contours,"" which overlay Bitcoin’s price movements across four-year cycles (2013, 2017, 2021, and 2025). The chart suggests a strong performance in Q3 and Q4 of 2025, with the analyst noting that Bitcoin’s historical four-year cycle remains intact. The analyst said, “Looking at two-year segments centered today, 4, 8, and 12 years ago. Price scaling performed using the power curve trendline. Expecting $200,000+ Bitcoin in Q4.

As illustrated in the chart, Bitcoin and gold achieved new highs between March and August 2024. However, in Q3 2024, gold spearheaded the rally, surpassing Bitcoin's performance.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView Gold is still leading BTC but has dropped 6% since hitting new highs, while Bitcoin has gained 11%. Cointelegraph reported that BTC tends to follow gold’s directional bias with a lag of 100-150 days. Based on that narrative, it is possible that Bitcoin could lead gold in the coming weeks. Similarly, the US Dollar Index (DXY) dropped to a new three-year low on April 21, which further fueled the likelihood of a rally for risk assets. Cointelegraph reported that multi-year DXY lows have been historically bullish for Bitcoin. Crypto analyst ‘Venture Founder’ also pointed out , “Traditionally, DXY going down is very bullish for $BTC, we now have a massive bearish divergence for DXY, which may suggest it goes to 90.

The analyst has had a minimum target of $10, which would be a 350% rise from current levels. His upper target of $40 would be an unprecedented 1,726% rise. The prediction relies on Elliott Wave Theory, which tries to foresee market movements through patterns of investor sentiment expressing themselves in price waves. The predictions rely on the strength and expansion of waves 3 and 5 within the overall structure of the market. Korean Markets Act As Leading Indicators XForceGlobal pointed out that Korean cryptocurrency exchanges play a vital role in the prediction of XRP price fluctuations. In the opinion of the analyst, Korean markets have in the past led in the recognition of significant XRP tops and bottoms. The similarity between XRP’s Korean won (KRW) chart and its US dollar chart was highlighted as especially significant. “We’re seeing the same structure on both charts. That adds conviction that wave 2 may be complete,” the analyst said.

The analyst indicated that “smart money” is already accumulating in XRP as retail interest starts coming back. XForceGlobal compared the strength of XRP’s community against the reported dwindling enthusiasm for Ethereum and Solana. The last stage of this cycle might involve a vertical, parabolic price action, perhaps initiating a new wave of FOMO among investors.
