Expert Analysts Give Their Predictions,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/will-history-repeat-itself-in-bitcoin-btc-expert-analysts-give-their-predictions/,"Cryptocurrency analysis company Alphractal drew attention to Bitcoin’s 4-year fractal cycle in its latest report. The company stated that this cycle has been repeated consistently since 2015, making BTC one of the most symmetrical assets in financial history. In its analysis published in November 2024, Alphractal predicted that the next cycle peak for Bitcoin could occur between October 12-16, 2025. Now, with only 6 months left until this estimated peak, the report stated that the fractal structure is still intact. The company stated that Bitcoin has determined both the top and the bottom of every cycle without error since 2015, which is an unprecedented achievement in the financial world.

It was noted that if history repeats itself, remarkable price movements could occur in the coming months. “Time will tell, but for now, Bitcoin's strong and delicate fractal structure remains intact.

Speaking during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Group spring meetings in Washington, Muhammad confirmed that Pakistan already holds a 30 billion yuan currency swap with China but now wants to boost it to 40 billion yuan. “From our perspective, getting to 40 billion renminbi would be a good place to move towards… we just put in that request,” Muhammad said . The swap expansion request ties into Pakistan’s urgent need to keep access to foreign currencies stable while strengthening its financial reserves. Besides pushing for a larger swap deal, Muhammad said Pakistan is getting close to launching its first-ever Panda bond, which is debt issued in China’s domestic market and denominated in yuan. Talks have been underway with the heads of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to secure credit enhancements for the bond issuance. Muhammad said discussions with both banks have been “constructive” and added, “We want to diversify our lending base and we have made some good progress around that—we are hoping that during this calendar year we can do an initial print.” Pakistan pushes for more support while managing new tensions China has been pushing swap agreements with several emerging economies, including Argentina and Sri Lanka, and now Pakistan is trying to extend its arrangement to keep up with growing financial needs. Muhammad said the plan to issue the Panda bond fits into Pakistan’s broader strategy to tap new markets and avoid overreliance on traditional lenders. On the international aid front, Muhammad said he expects the IMF executive board to approve Pakistan’s new $1.3 billion deal under a climate resilience loan program in early May. This approval will also cover the first review of the country’s existing $7 billion bailout package. Once the IMF board signs off, Pakistan will immediately unlock a $1 billion payout, a vital piece of the financial plan Pakistan secured in 2024 to prevent a full-blown economic collapse. Asked about the effects of escalating tensions with India, Muhammad said it would be “not helpful” for Pakistan’s economic outlook. Earlier this month, after the killing of 26 men at a tourist site, both countries retaliated. Pakistan shut its airspace to Indian airlines and froze trade ties. India responded by suspending the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, which controls how water from the Indus River system is shared. Muhammad pointed out that even before the latest dispute, trade between the two countries had already shrunk massively, totaling just $1.2 billion last year. Turning back to the domestic economy, Muhammad forecasted that Pakistan would hit about 3% growth for the financial year ending in June 2025. He said the country is aiming for growth of 4-5% the following year, with longer-term hopes of reaching 6%. He emphasized that expanding financial sources like the Panda bond, enlarging the swap line, and securing IMF funds are all pieces needed to hit those targets. Meanwhile, amid Pakistan’s strengthening relationship with China, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent met with Asian Development Bank President Masato Kanda on Friday. Bessent pressed Kanda to start moving China toward “graduation” from ADB borrowing, arguing that China’s economy no longer needs the same level of development bank assistance. The Treasury Department said Bessent also pushed Kanda to focus on “best value” procurement practices and pointed out the need for an “all-of-the-above energy strategy,” including financing options for civilian nuclear power projects.

Find Out!,https://coinpedia.org/uncategorized/was-jed-mccalebs-exit-from-ripple-a-breakup-or-a-brilliant-strategy-find-out/,"The post Was Jed McCaleb’s Exit from Ripple a ‘Breakup’ or a Brilliant Strategy? Find Out! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Jed McCaleb’s departure from Ripple in 2014 has long been the subject of speculation. Many believed it was the end of his involvement with the company, but what if it wasn’t a breakup? What if Jed’s split was a strategic move, part of a bigger plan to create a parallel blockchain system? Ripple & Stellar: Split That Wasn’t a Split Jed McCaleb, one of Ripple’s co-founders, was key in designing XRP’s early framework. He helped build XRP’s architecture and contributed to Ripple’s initial success. After some disagreements, Jed McCaleb left Ripple in 2014 and quickly started Stellar (XLM). (1/ ) Jed Didn’t Leave Ripple. He Was Assigned to Start Stellar. You were told it was all falling out. But what if Jed McCaleb’s split wasn’t a breakup… It was a deployment? And what if XRP and XLM were never rivals — but two arms of the same global plan? Let’s dive deep: pic.twitter.com/0v53GExE3j — Stellar Rippler (@StellarNews007) April 26, 2025 While many thought it was a breakup, the timing looks more like a planned move. It happened just as Ripple was growing in the world of big finance and global payment systems. Eventually, if we look at the timing of Jed’s departure, it aligns perfectly with Ripple’s institutional expansion, the rise of the ISO 20022 standard , and discussions by global financial bodies like the IMF, the BIS, and the WEF about the future of payments. This suggests that Jed wasn’t leaving; he was deployed to launch the second half of a global payment solution. XRP and XLM: Complementary, Not Competitive Ripple’s XRP and Stellar’s XLM were never rivals; they were two parts of the same global plan. XRP focuses on improving liquidity, enabling cross-border payments, and supporting central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) in the financial industry. On the other hand, Stellar works on bringing blockchain technology to underserved communities, humanitarian efforts, and retail stablecoin transactions. Strategic Partnerships on Both Sides Both Ripple and Stellar have quietly secured powerful partnerships. Ripple works with major financial institutions like Bank of America and SBI, supporting international banking systems. Meanwhile, Stellar is closely tied to humanitarian projects, with the United Nations using it for blockchain-based aid and Franklin Templeton using it for tokenizing assets. Jed McCaleb’s exit from Ripple wasn’t an accident; it was part of a well-timed plan. As Ripple focused on the institutional side, McCaleb’s Stellar project set out to bring the power of blockchain to the people.",Uncategorized,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|FIAT|TECHNOLOGY|XLM|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-26 20:37:32

On Saturday, Tesla’s Canadian website posted a banner that said: “Explore pre-tariff priced inventory while supplies last.” The move came after President Donald Trump dropped a fresh 25% tariff last month on Canadian goods, including vehicles with parts made outside the US, even under the US-Mexico-Canada trade pact. Canada immediately hit back with retaliatory import taxes aimed at mirroring the American tariffs. Pricing on Tesla’s site as of April 26 showed a big gap between new orders and existing inventory. A new long-range Model 3 with all-wheel drive jumped to C$79,990 (about $57,700). But identical 2025 model year cars already sitting in inventory were listed for around C$69,000. The difference made it obvious Tesla wanted buyers to move fast before getting hammered by higher prices. The sharp price increases were first spotted by DriveTeslaCanada.ca, which reported that for some models, the hikes are brutal. New orders for the all-wheel drive Cybertruck are now up to 22% more expensive than inventory models. For Canadian buyers trying to hold out, that’s bad news. Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, hasn’t made things easier north of the border either. Elon took heat in Canada after standing by Trump, who has openly joked that he wants Canada to join the United States. The eccentric billionaire recently promised that starting next month, he would spend more time focusing on Tesla, after the carmaker suffered its worst first-quarter financial results in years. Tesla stock rises after US pushes faster self-driving car rules Tesla shares jumped nearly 10% on Friday after Trump’s White House announced a plan to speed up self-driving vehicle approvals. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy revealed new rules that loosen federal safety standards for autonomous vehicles. That announcement gave Tesla a rare win after a rough few months. The rally followed a long stretch of losses for Tesla, with shares dropping around 40% since the beginning of 2025. The trade wars, tariffs, and nonstop market swings made it worse. Tesla also posted its worst quarterly loss since 2022 during the first three months of this year. Wall Street scrambled to respond. Piper Sandler said the earnings report was “the best result that TSLA bulls could’ve reasonably hoped for,” noting that “management said enough to keep the dream alive.” Even though problems still exist, the firm said the update helped calm some fears. Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said he thinks Tesla can make more money from software tied to full self-driving technology over the long term. But despite the optimism, Delaney kept Goldman’s neutral rating and cut Tesla’s price target. Others stayed skeptical. UBS and Wells Fargo both kept negative outlooks on Tesla. Wells Fargo analyst Colin Langan cut the firm’s price target for Tesla from $130 to $120. UBS warned that excitement over Tesla’s planned June robo-taxi launch might push the stock price up temporarily, but said it could end badly for some investors. They also flagged that Tesla might drop its plan for a low-cost vehicle launch, killing a potential catalyst for future growth. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Amid the ongoing market euphoria, prominent blockchain analytics company Glassnode has shared some important developments in the Bitcoin derivative markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin ‘Apparent Demand’ Makes Sharp Rebound – Will BTC Breakout Soon? Bitcoin Short Bets Rise Despite Price Rally, Setting Stage For Volatility Despite a bullish trading week, derivative traders are approaching the Bitcoin market with skepticism, as evidenced by a build-up of leveraged short positions. In a recent X post on April 25, Glassnode reported that Open Interest (OI) in Bitcoin perpetual swaps climbed to 218,000 BTC, marking a 15.6% increase from early March. In line with market activity, this rise in Open Interest aligns with increased leverage, introducing the potential for market volatility via liquidations or stop-outs. Generally, a rise in Open Interest amidst a price rally is expected to signal long-term market confidence. However, Glassnode’s findings have revealed an opposite scenario. Despite Bitcoin’s bullish strides in the past week, short market positions appear to be dominating the perpetual futures markets. This concerning development is indicated by a decline in the average funding rate, which has now slipped into negative territory to sit around -0.023%. The perpetual funding rate is a periodic payment between long and short traders aimed at keeping the contract price in line with the underlying spot price. A negative funding rate indicates short traders pay long traders as Bitcoin’s perpetual contract price is trading below the spot price. This is caused by a higher number of short positions as traders are largely bearish about Bitcoin, even despite recent gains. Furthermore, the 7-day moving average (7DMA) of long-side funding premiums has dropped to $88,000 per hour, reinforcing this short-dominant sentiment. This downtrend indicates a waning demand for long positions, as traders exhibit a short bias. However, Glassnode presents a bullish note stating that the present combination of rising leverage and short positions paves the way for a potential short squeeze, where an unexpected upward price move forces short-sellers to close their positions, thereby driving prices even higher. Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $94,629 following a 1.01% retracement from its local peak price on April 25. Despite creeping developments in the perpetual futures market, the BTC market remains highly bullish, indicated by gains of 1.02%, 11.12%, and 8.32% in the last one, seven, and thirty days, respectively. With a market cap of $1.88 trillion, the premier cryptocurrency ranks as the largest digital asset and fifth-largest asset in the world.

This rebound, fueled by fear, confusion, and desperate buyers, happened so fast it left most traders spinning. According to data from CNBC, the index jumped more than 10% from its lowest close and ripped 14% higher from the savage April 7 intraday low. The snap rally kicked off after a massive flight out of US dollar assets and Treasuries created a gaping hole in the market. The S&P 500 punched right into the gap left by the April 3 panic selloff. On a closing basis, the index has recovered exactly half of what it lost, but the damage to investor confidence and market structure still stinks. Buyers rush in as technical signals flash green Some of the technical signals flashing during this rebound would make a Wall Street nerd drool. Thursday triggered the rare and hyped-up Zweig breadth thrust, where the market sees a cluster of extreme positive breadth days after being smashed down. There have been 19 known cases of this since the 1940s, and every time, the S&P 500 finished higher six to twelve months later. Still, some analysts argue that recent decades brought more false alarms because of decimalized trading and a flood of ETFs letting people yank the whole market around at once. Bespoke Investment Group said every stock in the Nasdaq 100 went green on Tuesday. The S&P 500 also posted three straight days of gains over 1.5% from Tuesday to Thursday. History shows that when either of those two freak events happens, the market is usually higher a year later. But with small sample sizes and typical 12-month market gains anyway, nobody should be calling it safe just yet. Retail investors were the only ones consistently buying the dip, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s private-client flow data. Meanwhile, fast-money speculators flooded back after the multi-day rally last week. Jonathan Krinsky from BTIG, who had called for a short-term rally, warned Friday that the market could stall. He said the Goldman Sachs Retail Favorites Basket spiked 11.4% in just four trading days. The last two times that happened, in November 2022 and March 2022, massive plunges followed almost immediately. Tariffs fuel fears of deeper economic pain The recent S&P 500 drop fits a weird pattern where stocks bottom just shy of a 20% loss on a closing basis. The closing low in this pullback slipped a hair past 19%, which happened in 1990, 1998, 2011, and 2018, too. Only 1990 came with a US recession. But now, the odds of a full-blown recession are shooting up fast. Trump’s tariff war has companies slashing hiring plans and investments, bracing for harder times ahead. Trump’s delay on tariff hikes and talk of possible trade deals gave investors hope that the worst might still be avoided. But everyone is watching if soft economic data, like consumer surveys and CEO sentiment, starts leaking into hard facts like jobs and spending numbers. The start of Q1 earnings season brought a typical 70% of companies beating expectations, but CEOs had almost nothing good to say about the future. The tariff cloud hangs over everything. Companies are basically admitting they can’t give real guidance because this one man could yank the tariffs higher at any moment with literally no warning. FactSet reported, “To date, the market is rewarding positive earnings surprises reported by S&P 500 companies for Q1 more than average and punishing negative earnings surprises reported by S&P 500 companies for Q1 less than average.” Research from 3Fourteen shows that after 10% corrections, future earnings projections split depending on whether a recession hits. Before the last few weeks, the forecast looked more like the “no recession” track, but now estimates are slipping, raising more alarm. The liquidation frenzy that hit a few weeks back, mixed with the global “Sell America” wave, made even weak hints at easing tariffs and slightly better economic data enough to yank stocks higher. But closing the rest of the gap from February’s highs won’t be easy. Past panics like Russia’s 1998 default and the 2011 debt-ceiling mess didn’t feel resolved when the market started to bounce either. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The market has been rife with up-and-coming assets, each promising the next big thing. You’ve probably seen how fast coins like Solana exploded and became a “must-have,” only for it to settle and leave a few scratching their heads. With the rise of new projects in 2025, there’s one coin that’s currently making waves: Qubetics ($TICS). Could it be the next big thing? While the likes of Solana were once considered the future, could Qubetics be the missed opportunity of tomorrow? Let’s dive in and take a closer look. As the crypto market continues to shift, one thing remains clear—timing is everything. Solana was once the talk of the town, offering scalability and speed. But now, as its growth slows, attention has started to shift toward other rising stars. That’s where Qubetics comes into play. With its innovative tech and strong fundamentals, this new project is quickly gaining traction. The Qubetics presale has already raised over $16.4 million, and the token’s price is still incredibly affordable at $0.1902. Here’s why Qubetics might just be the opportunity you’ve been waiting for. Solana: A Missed Opportunity or a Lesson Learned? Solana was once hailed as the “Ethereum Killer.” It promised to solve the scalability problems that Ethereum struggled with, offering faster transaction speeds and lower fees. During its peak, Solana soared to new heights, pushing its price to over $250 per token. If you caught the Solana wave early on, you were likely sitting on some serious gains. But now, things are different. The once-mighty Solana has seen its value fluctuate, and while it’s still a top crypto asset, it’s no longer the new and shiny thing. For some, Solana’s rise was the stuff of dreams, but its later decline serves as a reminder of how volatile the market can be. Despite its speed and scalability, Solana faced network outages, security concerns, and increased competition. These factors led some to lose faith in its long-term potential. But what if you missed the boat on Solana? If you did, you might be feeling a bit of FOMO, especially as new projects like Qubetics pop up with fresh promises. Unlike Solana, Qubetics seems to be addressing real-world issues that many previous crypto projects couldn’t. Why Qubetics ($TICS) Is the Next Big Thing in Crypto Now, let’s talk about Qubetics. Unlike Solana, which focused primarily on scalability and speed, Qubetics is here to solve some of the most pressing problems faced by businesses and individuals in today’s digital world. One of the key reasons Qubetics is gaining attention is its focus on interoperability. It’s designed to work seamlessly across various blockchain platforms, enabling different networks to communicate and share data effortlessly. In a world where cross-chain compatibility is still a challenge, Qubetics has positioned itself as the solution. The Qubetics presale is currently in its 31st stage, and it has already sold over 509 million tokens to more than 25,200 holders, raising over $16.4 million. Despite all this success, the price of $TICS is still just $0.1902 per token in the current presale stage, making it an affordable entry point. Analysts predict that after the presale, $TICS could soar to $1, giving holders a 425% return on investment. If the price hits $5 after the presale, that’s a staggering 2527% ROI. And if $TICS reaches $15 after the mainnet launch, holders could see an astronomical 7783% return. With such promising predictions, Qubetics is positioning itself as the next crypto superstar.

This surge has propelled several alternative coins into the spotlight. Among them, SUI , VIRTUAL , and WLD are making notable gains. The article explores their current performance and potential for future growth, shedding light on which coins might see continued upward movement. SUI Bullish Surge: Gains and Key Price Levels SUI experienced a 37.16% rise over the last month and a remarkable 104.78% gain within six months. Price gains have been swift and pronounced, with weekly changes reaching 69.65% and stirring strong market interest. The data reflects a robust move upward over both recent short-term and longer-term periods, highlighting the coin’s growing momentum. SUI now trades between $1.74 and $3.03, with immediate resistance at $3.78 and a second hurdle at $5.07, while support is seen at $1.21. A high RSI of 77.58 indicates strong buying pressure, though caution is warranted for potential pullbacks. Traders might consider targeting resistance levels and watching for a breakout to signal the next leg in this market move. Virtuals Protocol Price Movements Amid Recent Volatility VIRTUAL experienced a rapid surge over the past week with prices soaring almost 93%. The one-month change reflected a solid gain of around 45.57%. However, over the half-year, the coin saw a moderate decline of 13.61%, indicating a mix of performance. Price changes have been characterized by short-term spikes and more tempered mid-term corrections. Recent activity suggests increased trading interest, but a stable long-term trend has not yet formed. Current trading sits between $0.35 and $1.02, with key resistance at $1.46 and solid support near $0.12. A high RSI near 79 signals bullish pressure, though caution is warranted. Traders might consider buying near support and monitoring for breaks above resistance while placing stops around the lower level for risk management. Worldcoin Market Outlook: Short-Term Gains Amid Longer-Term Decline Last month, WLD showed a clear rebound with a 26.55% increase and a 66.14% jump over one week. Despite this bullish momentum, the six-month figure dipped significantly by 42.39%. Price action has been characterized by volatility, with rapid rallies followed by notable pullbacks, creating a mixed picture of recent performance. Current trading stays between a low of $0.35 and a resistance near $1.47, indicating upbeat short-term momentum driven by bullish pressure. The range between $0.56 and $1.12 suggests a potential buying zone. Traders should monitor a breakout above $1.47 or consider exiting if the level fails to hold, ensuring risk management within these key levels. Conclusion The recent bounce in Bitcoin has led to a surge in altcoins like SUI , VIRTUAL , and WLD . SUI is showing strong potential with growing interest. VIRTUAL is gaining momentum driven by innovative features. WLD has seen a significant rise and continues to attract attention for its unique offerings. The positive trend in Bitcoin has provided a much-needed boost for these altcoins, suggesting an optimistic outlook in both the short and long term. Future performance of these coins will depend on sustained interest and further market developments. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Simkus reported on Friday at the Spring Meetings of the International Monetary Fund in Washington that global trade weakness, largely caused by new US tariffs, is bringing a new threat to Europe’s economy. He also noted that inflation was already declining and could slow down even further in the coming months. The deposit rate was cut for the seventh time since June last year, to 2.25%. However, Simkus thinks there is still room to ease policy without generating financial instability or overheating the economy. Simkus said there was no reason to remain in the current financial environment and that he could not rule out two more cuts this year, given the data he had in front of him. However, he added that more negative surprises would be needed to move lower. His remarks echo what the market has been expecting. Investors are betting on at least two further rate cuts this year. Some analysts, including the ones at Bank of America, forecast that the deposit rate could drop by 1.25% by December, suggesting four further tiny cuts. Simkus also emphasized that the ECB’s approach remained nimble and said he did not think they were late cutting interest rates. US tariffs and strong euro drag down expansion New evidence points to a softening of the eurozone’s economic recovery. Earlier this week, the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast for eurozone GDP, citing mounting trade tensions and tighter financial conditions as key factors. Simkus conceded that policymakers had been “overly optimistic” in predicting how fast the economy would rebound. He added that slower wage growth throughout the euro area has become a symptom of cooling demand. He also cited the recent strength of the euro against other currencies, which makes European exports less competitive abroad. US tariffs, meanwhile, have diverted more Chinese goods to Europe, adding disinflationary pressure. These factors are likely to be reflected in the ECB’s next batch of economic projections, which are set to be published in June. According to Simkus, the new numbers “are expected to include weaker economic growth and slower inflation than the assumptions” made in the previous forecast. Nevertheless, Simkus discounted even more substantial interest rate reductions unless the economy weakens precipitously. For now, the ECB will probably stick to its usual quarter-point steps. EC B sets the pace for action, not reliant on US deals Simkus also emphasized that the ECB will not sit back and wait until the US trade negotiations are imminent. The 90-day wait by the administration of President Trump was an attempt to impose some tariffs as binary options to enable trade agreements with major trading partners. Even with the US ultimatums to some countries, Simkus warned that trade policy uncertainty will probably remain. Several ECB officials shared similar views last week, citing softer manufacturing data and weaker growth in the service sector. Now, markets are watching economic data and the comments from ECB officials up to the bank’s next policy meeting in June. If the economy stays weak, a further rate cut could occur as soon as that meeting, leaving the ECB firmly on its current course of cautious but steady easing.

According to the company’s data, RAY has the highest Long/Short ratio among all altcoins. Following RAY, GTC, COS, DOT, ALPHA, MELANIA, AUDIO and REZ are among the other altcoins where long positions are higher than shorts. The Alphractal team noted that excessively high long/short ratios generally negatively impact altcoin performance, but can also occasionally trigger price bottoms. According to the company, this can create a short squeeze dynamic, with traders closing long positions and opening short positions when prices start to rise again. However, it was emphasized that an increase in Open Interest volume is required for this scenario to occur. Alphractal predicts that there is currently no significant increase in Open Interest in altcoins, so prices may move sideways in the coming days.

Wedson stated that the Bitcoin/Stablecoin Reserve Ratio on Binance has given a signal in the $76,000–$77,000 range again, reminding that this level has predicted major Bitcoin rallies in the past. Wedson used the following statements in his statement: “This behavior suggests that stablecoin reserves are growing faster than Bitcoin reserves, suggesting that there is ample capital ready to flow into crypto assets. The same signal appeared after the ‘Coronadump’ in 2020, at the end of 2022, and now again. In all of these instances, the Bitcoin price reacted positively.” *This is not investment advice.

Instead, employees say it barely works, and a mismanaged launch has left many wondering if automation is the right path for America’s largest social services agency. In recent months, Musk’s organization, known internally as DOGE , has aggressively reduced federal agencies by cutting jobs and budgets. The push toward an “AI-first” model aims to replace human workers with software wherever possible. As part of that strategy, the new chatbot was built into the everyday workflows of agency staffers, reported by Wired, with the promise of easing their workload. An internal email described it as a way to “assist employees with everyday tasks and enhance productivity,” but in practice, the app has received little attention. Sources inside the agency say the roll-out was accompanied by a painfully bad training video featuring a poorly animated, four-fingered woman. The clip was supposed to guide users through the app’s features, but it failed to warn staff against uploading sensitive personal data. This slip forced the agency to send a follow-up email reading, “Our apologies for the oversight in our training video,” to warn employees of the risk. Few people have taken the SSA AI training video seriously “I’m not sure most of my coworkers even watched the training video,” one Social Security staffer told Wired. They added that when they tested the chatbot, “several of the responses I received from it were incredibly vague and/or inaccurate.” Other employees reportedly mocked the crude graphics. “Nobody I know is [using it]. It’s so clumsy and bad,” the source said. Critics warn that this stumbling start may foreshadow wider failures. Similarly, in Brazil, during 2018, a state-owned company called Dataprev launched Meu INSS, an app designed to process social security claims using computer vision and natural language processing. However, the system has often rejected valid claims due to minor errors, triggering lengthy legal appeals. One example involves 55-year-old Josélia de Brito, a former sugarcane worker whose retirement application was denied because the automated system misidentified her gender. “I have all the documents proving my health condition, proving everything, and [the benefit] still gets denied. It’s a humiliation,” she told the Rest of World. Rural farmworkers, many of whom lack basic digital skills, have struggled with the shift to online services. “People out here cannot [even] work with Gmail, Facebook, Instagram,” said Francisco Santana, president of the Union for Rural Workers at Barra do Corda. “Processes are [getting] more and more automated, and society wasn’t made ready for it, especially further away, in the outskirts, for people that live in rural areas.” Those hurdles abroad highlight potential pitfalls for the U.S. Social services are already under pressure to “modernize,” a push that began under the Trump administration’s team of so-called technocrats. Musk’s DOGE has taken that mission further by seeking to cut the federal workforce in half. “Everything that can be machine-automated will be. And the technocrats will replace the bureaucrats,” a person familiar with DOGE’s plans told the Washington Post. DOGE’s emphasis on automation has bred confusion rather than efficiency. A recent mishap at the SSA illustrates the stakes. DOGE staff reportedly marked “countless” living benefit recipients as “dead,” cutting off their payments. “About 4 million people, they marked them as dead,” said Rennie Glasgow, a longtime claims technical analyst at the agency, speaking to The Daily Beast. “They’re sending us an email saying, ‘If these people come into the office with their identification, you can reinstate them.’” That reinstatement process can take “about three to four days,” Glasgow added, as staff must manually “resurrect” each recipient in the system. Beyond stopping benefits, DOGE also plans to rewrite the SSA’s entire software codebase within months. Sources say that to meet that deadline, the team will almost certainly rely on AI for coding, a practice that demands close oversight because of the high error rate in machine-generated code. Given DOGE’s rocky track record so far, an automated overhaul could introduce even more chaos. Some observers suspect those mistakes may be intentional. A school of critics argues that DOGE’s goal isn’t genuine reform but rather the destabilization of the SSA to pave the way for privatization. If so, the misfires and mayhem may be exactly what Musk’s team is aiming for. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The company confirmed the purchase of 111 Bitcoin at an average price of around $90,000 per coin. Overall, Semler now holds more than 3,300 Bitcoin, valuing its total crypto treasury at about $300 million. Measuring Bitcoin Yield Performance Semler highlighted that its Bitcoin acquisitions have contributed to a Bitcoin yield of 23.5% for shareholders so far this year. The Bitcoin yield metric compares the company’s Bitcoin holdings to its number of outstanding shares, helping to demonstrate how Bitcoin exposure per share has grown. “Semler Scientific uses BTC Yield as a [key performance indicator] to help assess the performance of its strategy of acquiring bitcoin in a manner Semler Scientific believes is accretive to stockholders,” the company explained. Since initiating this strategy in February, Semler has been aggressively building its Bitcoin position. Financing the Bitcoin Strategy The company stated it purchased its Bitcoin treasury for an average price close to $89,000 per coin. With Bitcoin currently trading at around $95,000, Semler’s investment has seen early gains. To support its Bitcoin acquisitions, Semler has financed the purchases by issuing roughly $125 million in new stock. Additionally, in January, the firm announced plans to raise another $75 million through a private offering of convertible senior notes. Semler Scientific primarily operates in the healthcare sector, developing diagnostic products that help detect chronic diseases. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings on the Rise Semler’s move follows a broader trend among corporations accumulating Bitcoin for their treasuries. Data shows public companies collectively hold approximately $71 billion worth of Bitcoin as of April 25. Leading the pack is Michael Saylor’s Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), which boasts a treasury valued at over $50 billion. During the week of April 14 alone, Strategy acquired an additional 6,556 Bitcoin at an average price of $84,785 per coin. Despite corporations building significant Bitcoin reserves, they still trail behind Bitcoin holdings managed by exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which control about $110 billion in Bitcoin. Semler’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy mirrors the growing institutional appetite for digital assets, signaling a continuing shift in corporate finance strategies.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-04-26 21:51:46

The cryptocurrency analyst from SwallowAcademy predicts Dogecoin (DOGE) will experience a 40% price decrease which will push its valuation to $0.09 before starting its rise. During its presale funding phase Mutuum Finance (MUTM) managed to secure $7.2 million in investment money while distributing 425 million tokens to a total of 9,100 token holders. The current price of the token stands at $0.025 during phase 4 but it aims to achieve a 140% gain until it reaches the public listing value of $0.06. This DeFi project’s systematic growth path proves itself to be a dominant competitor against Dogecoin in the crypto market space. Dogecoin’s Uncertain Path Dogecoin shows price volatility with trading at $0.1832 following its 103% volume increase that drove trading volume to 1.89 billion. The analyst Steph_iscrypto predicts a breakout based on a 129-day price downtrend which has historically led to 500% market runs. SwallowAcademy presents an unfavorable view of Dogecoin by warning about its impending collapse because hype serves as a crutch for its survival. JavonTM1 forecasts Dogecoin will reach $1.25 but each successive higher low points to susceptibility. The path of Dogecoin progresses without practical use and depends heavily on social opinion and potential ETF project initiatives. Structured investment alternatives feature low volatility which compels investors to choose projects using concrete financial instructions. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently operates within phase 4 while its token price remains at $0.025. The strong market interest led investors to purchase 9,100 tokens out of the 425 million available which generated $7.2 million in total sales. Current buyers participating in Phase 5 will obtain a 20% increase as the token value rises to $0.03 from the current $0.025 during phase 4. Tokenomics structure ensures investors will achieve a total 140% return after the assets list on exchanges for $0.06. An analysis predicts Mutuum Finance tokens will reach $3.50 after launch date which would result in a 13900% return on investment across phase 4. One starts with a $1,000 investment and will grow to become $140,000 during 2025. A Certik smart contract audit result will soon be made available through social channels to enhance trust in the platform. Mutuum’s DeFi Edge Mutuum Finance now permits the top 50 community members to receive bonus tokens as part of their extended platform support. Mutuum Finance runs with a stable lending system that combines peer-to-peer together with peer-to-contract lending due to its overcollateralized loan requirement and interest-generating capability of mtTokens. The platform directs revenue towards buying tokens to sustain market demand through its buy-and-distribute operation strategy. A rapidly selling ecosystem in Phase 4 serves as the main advantage for early platform investors to take an interest. The utility-based approach of MtToken outperforms Dogecoin because it draws investors whose main goal is dependable market expansion. Why Mutuum Outshines Dogecoin The predicted 500% rally for Dogecoin entices investors yet its speculative nature fails to match Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that utilizes mathematics to construct its DeFi system. The entry price of $0.025 during Phase 4 operates as a brief but vital moment to achieve 140% listing revenue growth and subsequent opportunities for up to 13,900% returns when the price reaches $3.50 in 2025.

In the ever-changing world of digital assets, Cardano (ADA) finds itself at an important stage, with its price action presently moving around the most important support levels. This moment, noted by attentive investors, shows that it is a decisive period for the token and is in contrast with the increased exposure and bullish sentiment surrounding both Avalanche (AVAX) and the emerging force that is MAGACOIN FINANCE. Cardano’s Balancing Act: Testing Key Support Cardano’s journey has never lacked drama for those who have always followed its developments and price movement. According to the latest live market data, ADA is presently trading around the $0.38 price mark–a zone that is watched closely by analysts and investors. While the project’s community and its technology remain strong, investors are still advised to be cautious. A drop below the $0.38 support could open the asset to an increased movement downwards. A sustained bounce here could also kickstart bullish optimism Experienced traders are looking at the best entry strategies ADA’s ability to hold ground here will likely shape the way the token will trade. Avalanche Builds Momentum Amid Investor Optimism AVAX Rises with Ecosystem Growth and Layer 1 Traction Avalanche (AVAX) has been seeing increased analyst attention thanks to its huge ecosystem advances and a clear rise in investor demands. According to live data, the token is trading around $26.07, seeing a jump of 9% in the past week, showing a big market interest. AVAX is benefitting from scalability and its high-speed transaction capabilities. Its growing ecosystem has been impressing developers and investors alike. Its position in the layer 1 space appears to favor the token. Smart investors see this action as evidence of Avalanche’s strong positioning within the broader crypto industry. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Rare, High-Reward Opportunity Emerging While established projects continue to move close to important technical levels, experienced investors are currently scanning the market for opportunities where rewards could transform things. Enter MAGACOIN FINANCE–the new crypto star attracting lots of forward-thinking investors looking for early entry. Structured for long-term upside and designed for increased multiple growth.

It is a project that has been gaining attention from smart money, positioned well before listings, and has global access–a true rare quality in the crowded market of today. Knowledgeable traders recognize this upside before the rest of the market catches on, seeing that the entry window is still open, and the token is still trading below its breakout zone. Why Investors Are Jumping In Now For experienced investors, the mathematics is simple: the best opportunities are found where Visionary projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer the best entry position ahead of the herd.

As the market consolidates strength and early signals flash, these projects are standing out for their ability to anchor the next major crypto wave—and those positioning early could be preparing for a major run. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing Early-Stage Momentum That Can’t Be Ignored Projects that succeed over the long term always show early signs—measured growth, strong community expansion, and consistent delivery. MAGACOINFINANCE is hitting all of those marks right now. Wallet adoption is rising daily. Development milestones are hitting on time. And conversations around MAGACOINFINANCE are shifting from curiosity to conviction among serious early-stage investors. The project’s growth is happening quietly, strategically, and without artificial hype—exactly the way major success stories in crypto have unfolded before. MAGACOINFINANCE presents something even rarer: early-stage momentum with wide-open potential. Projects to Watch: Uniswap, Polkadot, and Litecoin Uniswap continues to lead decentralized exchange volume and remains a cornerstone of DeFi infrastructure. Polkadot is building the foundation for true multi-chain interoperability, with parachains offering developers new ways to scale and specialize blockchain use cases. Litecoin , often called the silver to Bitcoin’s gold, maintains a strong role in fast, low-fee peer-to-peer payments across a variety of exchanges and platforms. While all three of these projects are vital to the ecosystem, none offer the pure early-stage growth opportunity that MAGACOINFINANCE brings to the table today. Conclusion Crypto’s biggest success stories come from recognizing real growth before it becomes the mainstream narrative. Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP are laying strong foundations for the next cycle—but MAGACOINFINANCE.COM could be the hidden gem that delivers the kind of early-stage breakout gains that define generational wealth opportunities. The growth trajectory is being mapped now—the time to move is before the market fully catches on.

WLFI is the decentralized finance (DeFi) backed by President Donald Trump, and the collaboration will see it fast-track blockchain in the country. Strategic Alliance to Drive Crypto Innovation in Pakistan As per the LOI, WLFI will also drive the adoption of stablecoin and DeFi integration across Pakistan. This development comes ahead of the government’s plans to unveil a comprehensive blueprint on cryptocurrency legalization. Notably, the Pakistani author is looking to embrace digital assets and join the region’s financial innovation wave. The country seems to be positioning itself as one of the world’s rising crypto hubs. The LOI was signed at a meeting between WLFI and PCC, and a high-powered delegation represented both parties. On the part of the PCC, notable delegates included the Pakistan Finance Minister, the State Bank of Pakistan Governor, and the CEO of PCC, among others. The WLFI delegation had Zachary Witkoff, son of Steve Witkoff, the United States Special Envoy to the Middle East, Chase Herro, and Zachary Folkman. Crypto Momentum Leverages Pakistan’s Youth Population Speaking on the decision for the move, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb highlighted the country’s youthful population and technology as its greatest assets. He noted that the government is creating investment opportunities in the blockchain economy through such a partnership. Over 64% of Pakistan’s population is below the age of 30. According to data, the country has over 25 million active crypto users and approximately $300 billion worth of crypto transactions annually. Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, maintains that the collaboration with WLFI is strategic. According to Saqib, the move is to empower Pakistan’s youth and ensure the country is well-positioned to take advantage of the future of global finance. WLFI Expands Global Footprint This development signals the growing adoption of digital currency worldwide and reveals how WLFI has been active in the sector. Recently, it added 4.89 million SEI tokens, estimated at $0.775 million, to its holdings as part of a diversification move. Meanwhile, WLFI has secured $250 million from investors as part of its public token sale. The recent collaboration with Pakistan signals its push for global presence.

Led by Jack Mallers of Strike, Twenty One Capital aims to compete directly with MicroStrategy by employing a strategy of issuing stock to buy Bitcoin, leveraging convertible debt and a reflexive flywheel model. The company plans to accumulate Bitcoin at scale through a global alliance and is preparing to go public via a SPAC backed by Cantor Fitzgerald. This move signals a shift in Bitcoin investment focus from grassroots to Wall Street, embracing Leveraged Bitcoin Equities (LBE) rather than spot ETFs. Analysts note that the success of this approach depends on maintaining a premium on the stock. The initiative represents a $4 billion head start over MicroStrategy's similar playbook and reflects growing institutional interest in Bitcoin acquisition vehicles.

With timelines flooded and Telegram groups buzzing, the meme coin arena is once again brimming with wild bets and unexpected winners. While big names like Floki Inu and ANDY have carved out their cult followings, there’s another contender stealthily sharpening its claws. One that hasn’t even hit exchanges yet but is already turning heads among presale hunters. Meet the mysterious whiskered wildcard everyone’s whispering about: Troller Cat ($TCAT). Still in whitelist-only mode, Trollercat isn’t just another meme project—it’s a community-powered movement wrapped in internet chaos, Ethereum smarts, and serious viral potential. If you’ve missed past rocket rides like DOGE or SHIB, this could be your redemption arc. Let’s dive into the top 8 meme coins clawing for attention in 2025. 1. Troller Cat ($TCAT) Troller Cat ($TCAT) is a meme coin born from the legendary art of trolling, and it proudly wears that identity. Rooted in Ethereum, this coin isn’t following meme culture; it’s creating it. With a rich narrative inspired by history’s greatest trolls, Troller Cat is out to claw its way to the top with clever marketing, meme mastery, and a rabidly engaged community. While most meme coins lean heavily on hype alone, Troller Cat brings layers of humor, lore, and strategic mischief into its branding. The Trollercat.com whitelist is currently open, and insiders are jumping in before this feline furball takes off. Rumors are circulating about deflationary mechanics tied to a play-to-earn Game Center, which could utilize ad revenue to buy back and burn tokens, thereby reducing the supply while increasing demand. Additionally, early adopters are speculating on lucrative staking rewards reserved for presale participants. Getting in early could be the difference between 10 times and 100 times. Why This Coin Made It to the List: The buzz around Troller Cat isn’t just empty noise—it’s coming from top-tier crypto groups, Twitter alpha threads, and FOMO-filled chats. With the whitelist still open, the chance to pounce before the crowd does is very real. This isn’t a coin you stumble across after it moons—it’s one to get into while the claws are still in stealth mode. 2. Floki Inu ($FLOKI) Floki Inu is no stranger to the spotlight. Born from the Shiba Inu and Dogecoin frenzy, it has since evolved into a powerhouse of its own. With a Viking-themed identity and a roadmap that includes a metaverse game (Valhalla), educational platform (Floki University), and DeFi utilities, Floki Inu offers more than just meme power—it delivers layered ecosystem potential. Why This Coin Made the List: Floki Inu combines meme appeal with a dedicated development team and tangible progress. The coin’s aggressive marketing, large community, and steady development mean it’s still on investors’ radars heading into 2025. 3. ANDY ($ANDY) ANDY is the meme coin that thrives on unpredictability. With a playful branding style and an anti-establishment vibe, it has built a cult following on social media. Its appeal lies in its raw meme energy, unfiltered communication, and ability to generate virality seemingly out of nowhere. Why This Coin Made It to the List: ANDY’s ability to punch above its weight in visibility makes it a consistent wildcard in the meme coin race. For investors who missed out on early DOGE or PEPE runs, ANDY still offers a shot at a meme-fueled pump. 4. Degen ($DEGEN) DEGEN lives up to its name—embracing the chaotic, high-risk-high-reward world of meme trading. It appeals to traders who wear their degeneracy as a badge of honor. With humor, sarcasm, and full embrace of crypto madness, DEGEN has secured a strong niche. Why This Coin Made It to the List: DEGEN’s branding and vibe resonate strongly with Gen-Z and millennial investors who love the thrill of the meme market. Its consistent engagement and wild price swings keep it relevant. 5. Dogs ($DOGS) Dogs is the no-nonsense, all-fun meme coin that rounds up every dog-themed token vibe into one community-driven project. It taps into nostalgia and meme history with a lighthearted approach, encouraging holders to bark, bite, and band together. Why This Coin Made It to the List: With meme projects, community is king—and Dogs has a loud, loyal pack. Its simplicity is part of the charm, making it an easy pick for meme coin explorers. 6. Apu Apustaja ($APU) Apu Apustaja is inspired by the wholesome and meme-worthy frog character from early internet culture. Beyond its comedic appeal, the coin has built a social impact narrative, funding community causes and tying humor to responsibility. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Apu stands out for blending memes with meaning. In a sea of chaos, its community-driven mission and nostalgic value offer unique appeal. 7. Gigachad ($GIGA) Gigachad leans into alpha energy like no other. With meme stylings focused on masculinity, dominance, and over-the-top aesthetics, it has carved out a niche for itself as the go-to coin for meme muscle. Why This Coin Made It to the List: Gigachad’s ability to go viral repeatedly, thanks to its meme fuel and edgy humor, keeps it in the conversation, especially among younger investors seeking high-octane hype. 8. Brett ($BRETT) Brett is a spin-off meme coin that taps into Bro culture and cartoon satire, leveraging internet absurdity to keep eyeballs glued. With high engagement on social media and a mascot that embodies Gen-Z energy, it’s a favorite among meme enthusiasts. Why This Coin Made the List: Its humor-driven vibe and creative memes make it a standout project. Brett’s brand personality helps it stand out from more generic meme clones. Conclusion: Based on the latest research, these are the top meme coins to buy before 2025: Troller Cat, Floki Inu, ANDY, Degen, Dogs, Apu Apustaja, Gigachad, and Brett. Each of these coins has its own style, story, and strategy—but only one is still in whitelist mode and stirring up real presale buzz. Troller Cat (TCAT) isn’t just purring—it’s prowling for dominance. With rumors of a deflationary Game Center, early staking rewards, and lore-fueled branding, this feline’s presale might be the most underestimated move in meme coin land. For those seeking the next potential 100x play, the Trollercat.com whitelist could be the opportunity to get in before the herd. Don’t get caught chasing the tail—join the pack while this cat’s still in stealth.

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has shown a strong footing over the last 72 hours, even as the stock market and the traditionally stable bond market continue to exhibit erratic patterns. Bitcoin’s latest bull move has propelled the major digital currency’s total market capitalization above $1.87 trillion, and a 11.6% spike in weekly trading volume has been witnessed. The premier digital asset has risen strongly from its April lows of around $75,000 and is now 25% higher from that level, showing strong gains despite the overall gloomy outlook. Stocks Fall, Gold and BTC Rise Bitcoin has long been touted as a valid store of value alongside Gold. Its safe haven reputation has strengthened over time and was on display during the last few weeks as the world grappled with US President Donald Trump’s global tariff wars. Here is an interesting CNBC infographic: While both BTC and Gold have performed well this month, stocks continue to suffer due to ongoing uncertainty in traditional markets. In addition to the stock market, US government bonds are also facing some selling pressure. These U.S. Treasury securities have historically been considered among the safest investments, with steady interest rate returns. However, for the first time, these payments are expected to surpass the US government’s defense spending, which highlights the pressure on the American economy. There has been some selling in the bond market, which has alarmed economists in the US and around the world, and has stopped Trump from firing the head of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, following a dispute on interest rates. If the bonds fall further, we could face a major financial crunch immediately, as it indicates that trust in the US government is declining quickly. ETFs Record Major Inflows In addition to crypto exchange volumes, major US-based Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) also experienced significant net inflows after a long time. In total, the 11 ETFs had $381 million in net inflows on Monday and a massive $912 million on Tuesday, showing a sharp uptick in institutional activity. Altcoins Respond This string of positive developments has reignited the crypto market, and there are hopes that the long-term bull market of 2024-2025 will resume in the near future, following several months of a bearish outlook. The rest of the coin market also experienced healthy gains as it followed BTC into short-term bullish territory. Major gainers included Ethereum (ETH, 10%), Ripple (XRP, 8%), Solana (SOL, 8%), Dogecoin (DOGE, 11%), Cardano (ADA, 10%), and Sui (SUI, 23%).",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-26 22:25:42

Fed Rescinds Crypto Restrictions, Drawing Industry Praise On Friday, the Fed, along with the OCC and FDIC, officially rescinded guidance that discouraged banks from working with crypto firms. Given the Fed’s central role in banking oversight, this move has attracted industry-wide commendation.

The biggest success stories often start with small, calculated moves—and right now, a $750 investment could be the starting point for the next big narrative. As Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP continue their upward momentum, another name is starting to emerge alongside them: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . It’s not just about which assets are performing—it’s about which ones are still early enough to matter for those seeking exponential returns. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quickly Becoming a Top Early-Stage Focus The window to find undervalued projects is never open for long. And right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is attracting the kind of serious investor attention that suggests something bigger is brewing. This isn’t another flash-in-the-pan token. It’s a structured, steadily expanding project. Wallet activity is climbing. Community engagement is real. And most importantly, the project’s momentum is building organically—without relying on cheap tricks or forced marketing. When Bitcoin was early, when Solana was still overlooked, it was quiet traction like this that signaled bigger moves ahead. Other Noteworthy Names: Uniswap, Polkadot, Bitcoin Cash, and Litecoin Uniswap remains the leading decentralized exchange protocol, offering unmatched liquidity and consistent usage across DeFi applications. Polkadot continues to push interoperability forward, linking blockchains together through its innovative parachain model. Bitcoin Cash still finds support among those looking for fast, low-cost peer-to-peer transactions, staying true to crypto’s original payment ethos. Litecoin remains a reliable, battle-tested altcoin for simple, efficient transfers across global platforms. These projects provide solid infrastructure—but MAGACOINFINANCE still carries the rare advantage of being undiscovered by the masses. Final Word Can $750 turn into $1.5 million? History has shown it’s possible—but only for those who move early on projects with real growth engines.

After struggling under $87,000 for the past two months, the flagship cryptocurrency has finally returned above the $90,000 level. It remains unclear whether the recent BTC price surge is a continuation signal for the bull cycle. However, the latest on-chain data suggests that the investor sentiment might be turning positive again, meaning that the Bitcoin bull run could truly be back on. ‘ETF Printer Goes Brrr’ – Crypto Analyst In an April 25 post on the X platform, a crypto analyst with the pseudonym Maartunn shared an on-chain insight into the recent price rally experienced by the world’s largest cryptocurrency. According to the online pundit, the growing appetite of exchange-traded fund (ETF) investors in the past few days might have contributed to the Bitcoin bullish momentum. Related Reading: Litecoin Conviction Remains Strong: More Than 20% Of Supply Frozen Since 5+ Years The relevant indicator here is the Coinbase Premium Gap, which tracks the difference between the Bitcoin price on US-based Coinbase Pro (USD pair) and global Binance exchange (USDT pair). When this difference is positive, it implies BTC is trading at a higher price on Coinbase than on Binance. Typically, a positive Coinbase Premium Gap indicates that US-based investors are purchasing Bitcoin aggressively, especially through ETF issuers that use Coinbase as a liquidity provider. According to data from CryptoQuant, this metric’s 30-hour moving average has stayed positive for more than 265 straight hours (approximately 11 days). Maartunn noted that this is the fifth-longest streak since the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds started trading in January 2024. Typically, a consistently positive Coinbase Premium Gap suggests that US institutional players and large investors are willing to pay above-market prices for Bitcoin — specifically through regulated channels like ETFs or custodial platforms. This prolonged positive streak is historically correlated with positive price action and accumulation phases for the flagship cryptocurrency. Hence, the latest spike in the Coinbase Premium Gap could provide the adequate condition to sustain Bitcoin’s newly-found bullish momentum and perhaps catalyze the next significant breakout. Bitcoin Price At A Glance The price of Bitcoin has climbed above $95,000 for the first time since February, reflecting a 2% increase in the past 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the premier cryptocurrency has surged by more than 13% in the past seven days.

As part of this transition, Sonic plans to introduce new features to increase community engagement and enhance its ecosystem’s utility, which could drive demand for its token. However, the price of FTM is expected to remain largely influenced by overall market sentiment and the platform’s adoption rate. The success of this rebranding will likely depend on how effectively Sonic aligns with the crypto market’s growing focus on regulatory compliance. Will Sonic (Prev.FTM) reclaim FTM’s all-time of $3.48 soon? How high can Sonic (S) go in 2025? Let’s dive into Sonic’s price predictions for 2025 and beyond. Overview Cryptocurrency Sonic Token S Price $0.5389 Market Cap $1.55B Trading Volume $160.99M Circulating Supply 3.17B S All-time High $1.03 on Jan 4, 2025 All-time Low $0.04356 on Jan 29, 2025 24-h High $0.5711 24-h Low $0.5273 Sonic (S) price prediction: Technical analysis Volatility 7.71% 50-Day SMA $ 0.504028 14-Day RSI 55.78 Green Days 12/30 (40%) Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 65 (Greed) 200-Day SMA – Sonic price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Sonic shows a cautiously bullish trend on both the 4-hour and 1-day charts with price action testing key resistance Indicators like RSI and MACD support further upward movement while minor selling pressure suggests the need for caution A successful breakout above $0.55 could open the way toward $0.60 but traders should watch for resistance barriers Sonic (S) price analysis 1-day chart Sonic/USD 1-Day Chart Based on the 1-day chart on April 26, Sonic (SONIC) demonstrates a cautiously bullish structure. The price has broken slightly above the midline of the Bollinger Bands, suggesting an attempt to establish upward momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near 58, indicating growing buying pressure but not yet overbought conditions. Sonic is currently challenging the upper Bollinger Band, and a confirmed breakout above $0.55 could initiate a stronger rally toward $0.60. However, if the momentum weakens, the price might retest the midline support near $0.48. Overall, Sonic’s daily trend points toward cautious optimism with an eye on resistance levels. S/USD technical analysis 4-hour chart Sonic/USD 4-hour Chart Based on the 4-hour chart, Sonic (SONIC) exhibits moderate bullish momentum. The price is pressing against the Bollinger Bands’ upper boundary, suggesting heightened volatility and strong buying interest. The MACD histogram remains slightly positive, while the MACD and signal lines are close to a bullish crossover, which could reinforce short-term gains. However, the Balance of Power indicator is slightly negative, hinting at some underlying selling pressure. If buyers maintain momentum, Sonic could challenge resistance around $0.56. Conversely, failure to sustain above $0.54 may lead to a correction toward the $0.52 support region.

Based on the 4-hour and 1-day charts, Sonic (SONIC) displays a cautiously bullish outlook. On the 1-day chart, SONIC tests the upper Bollinger Band with an RSI near 58, suggesting strong but not overextended buying momentum. The breakout attempt above $0.55 is crucial for sustained gains. Meanwhile, the 4-hour chart also shows SONIC trading near the upper band, with the MACD signaling a potential bullish crossover. However, the Balance of Power hints at minor selling pressure that could cap gains in the short term. If buying strength continues, SONIC could advance toward $0.60, but caution is warranted around resistance levels. Is Sonic a good investment? Sonic is a high-speed, scalable blockchain platform gaining attention as an alternative to networks like Ethereum. Based on our analysis, we are optimistic about its growth, projecting a $1.03 price by 2025 and $6.99 by 2030. Despite its potential, investing in Sonic (S) involves risks typical of cryptocurrencies, including market volatility. Own research and an assessment of personal risk tolerance are essential steps for anyone considering S as a potential investment opportunity Will Sonic reach $5? The price of Sonic could reach $5 by 2030, with price predictions suggesting a high of $5.39. However, achieving this depends on market conditions and overall blockchain adoption trends. Will Sonic reach $10? Based on our technical analysis, Sonic can approach double-digit prices within the next 6 years. Our recent Sonic predictions suggest that by 2031, S could attain a price of about $10. Is Sonic a safe network? Sonic is regarded as a secure blockchain platform that utilizes its unique Lachesis consensus mechanism for high-speed and scalable transactions. However, as with any blockchain network, users should exercise caution, use official channels, and follow best security practices to protect their assets. Does Sonic have a good long-term future? Sonic shows potential for a strong long-term future, with price predictions suggesting significant growth by 2030 and beyond. Analysts forecast that prices could reach between $5.89 and $6.99, driven by its unique blockchain technology and increasing adoption in decentralized applications. However, market volatility remains a concern. Recent news/opinion on Sonic (prev.

Hashdex, a Brazilian crypto asset manager, has launched the XRP spot ETF on Brazil’s B3 stock exchange. Brazil Leads With First-Ever Spot XRP ETF XRP is the industry’s fourth most valuable cryptocurrency with a $158 billion market cap as of this writing. But despite its dominance in the cryptosphere, regulatory obstacles have effectively hindered the launch of a spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) until now. Asset manager Hashdex has launched the Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Fundo de Índice, or Hashdex Nasdaq XRP FI, according to a press release from Valor Econômico. Hashdex received the sign-off from Brazil’s Securities and Exchange Commission (CVM) to launch the XRP-based ETF back in February. After the approval by the country’s financial investments regulator, the fund entered into a pre-operational phase. The ETF was undergoing preparatory steps during this time and was not available for trading. Now trading on B3 under the ticker XRPH11, the fund will track the price of XRP across major crypto exchanges using the Nasdaq XRP Reference Price Index. The fund’s approval comes as issuers across the globe aim to address skyrocketing demand for crypto-focused investment products, amid a more friendly regulatory environment for these products and broadening acceptance among retail and institutional investors. Brazil: A Crypto Hub Brazil is notably Latin America’s largest economy, and the third-biggest economy in the Americas after the U.S. and Canada. It is also the region’s most prominent crypto player: Brazil has more Bitcoin ETFs than any other Latin American nation, and many of the country’s major banks offer investors some sort of digital asset exposure. Hashdex currently does not issue a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States, but in December received approval from the SEC for a combo ETF offering investors exposure to both Bitcoin and Ethereum. J.P. Morgan analysts have predicted that, if approved, U.S.-listed funds could gobble between $4 billion and $8 billion in investor money. Spot Bitcoin funds have accrued over $38 billion in net inflows since going live in January 2024. Their Ethereum equivalents have attracted roughly $4 billion in net flows since trading began last July.",Cryptocurrency|News|Brazil|Ripple|USA|XRP News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-26 22:34:36

The prominent altcoin has been one of the major headliners of the current market cycle, increasing by 192.70% in the past year. However, certain market technical indicators show that SUI is likely headed for a correction following its most recent explosive gains. Related Reading: SUI Price Soars Despite Overbought RSI – Can The Rally Sustain? Elliott Wave Count Suggests Pullback Looms For SUI In an X post on Friday, X market analytics handle More Crypto Online shared an interesting analysis on the SUI market using the Elliott Wave theory — a technical tool that predicts future price trends by recognizing recurring wave-like patterns. According to the analysts at More Crypto Online, SUI’s bullish performance in the past week means the altcoin has surged to the 178.6% Fibonacci extension level around $3.71. This specified Fibonacci level represents a major technical milestone as it is a classic target area in Wave 3 in the Elliott Wave analysis. For context, the Elliott Wave theory postulates that price movements occur in five recurring wave patterns. Wave 3 is usually regarded as the strongest and longest wave in a bullish trend. It is a wave of confirmation indicating a robust market participation. Based on the current wave count in the SUI market, the altcoin is completing the final stages of Wave 3, having surpassed the minimum Fibonacci extension level of 138%. As expected, signs of waning demand are beginning to set in, as indicated by a 5.7% price retracement in the past day. More Crypto Online predicts Wave 4 — a corrective price phase may now be imminent. SUI is expected to experience a price pullback with initial support zone set at $3.27. Notably, a decisive price break below this level would confirm the end of Wave 3 and the beginning of Wave 4. Furthermore, a deeper market support lies between $2.95 and $2.75, which represents the 38.2% – 50% Fibonacci retracement zone of the Wave 3 move. More Crypto Online views this price region as the support target zone for a healthy Wave 4 correction. Therefore, market bulls must hold this price zone to retain SUI’s bullish structure and set the stage for a potential Wave 5 breakout. SUI Price Outlook At press time, SUI trades at $3.58 following an 8.85% overall gain in the past day. Meanwhile, the coin’s daily trading volume is up by 18.64% and valued at $3.44 billion. If SUI’s price retracement continues, the altcoin is expected to trigger Wave 4 of its current wave cycle, indicating a potential 50% correction lies ahead. However, if bullish momentum remains intact, SUI could rise to around the 200% Fibonacci extension level, around $3.99, which represents the coin’s next major resistance.

On Thursday, the South Korean crypto exchange giant Bithumb announced it was listing XYO, the native token of the XYO Network. The XYO Network aims to process any type of decentralized data. Explains the project’s website , “Encompassing both a network and protocol, XYO can be used for aggregating, verifying, organizing, and utilizing decentralized data from any hardware node capable of running XYO-enabled software or firmware. XYO’s defining premise is decentralized verification, allowing network devices to verify the data flowing into the network’s databases by acting as witnesses for one another, strengthening the veracity of data received. Simple, accessible organization then allows this data to be put to use quickly and efficiently.” Earlier this month, the project announced it would be migrating its network to a new layer-1 chain focused on DePIN. To help facilitate that move, the XYO Network is also rolling out a new layer-1 native token, XL1, and will operate with a dual-token model going forward. The original XYO token will stay on Ethereum ( ETH ) and act “as an anchor to regulate the flow of XL1 into its native blockchain,” according to the project . XYO is trading at $0.0154 at time of writing. The 278th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is also up by more than 71% in the past week.

Today, Bitcoin (BTC) , Solana (SOL) , and XRP remain strong across major exchanges—but sharp investors are expanding their focus toward rising early-stage projects. Among the most discussed right now is MAGACOINFINANCE —an asset building real traction ahead of broader market visibility. Early accumulation phases like this often define the top winners of the next cycle. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing Strong ROI Potential Momentum around MAGACOINFINANCE is growing steadily—driven by real wallet expansion, organic community building, and strategic rollout timing. Based on analyst tracking of stealth-phase growth, projections now suggest MAGACOINFINANCE could deliver a potential upside as listings expand and broader exposure kicks in. This rare positioning is what smart investors target before prices adjust to reflect full market interest. Other Noteworthy Movers: XRP, SOL, KAS, and OP XRP continues solidifying its dominance in digital payments and global remittance channels. Solana (SOL) leads innovation with high-speed, low-cost decentralized finance solutions. Kaspa (KAS) is redefining blockchain scalability with blockDAG technology. Optimism (OP) scales Ethereum infrastructure through Layer-2 efficiency and performance. While these assets are already well-integrated, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the stealth-phase potential where outsized returns are still in reach for early movers. Final Word Crypto rewards those who spot strength before the headlines do. While Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP continue reinforcing their place in the ecosystem, MAGACOINFINANCE is setting up quietly—and those positioned now could be in for some of 2025’s biggest rewards.

In the midst of this, a new project is building serious momentum under the radar, MAGACOINFINANCE . A token that many early investors are now ranking among their top early-stage picks for 2025. The combination of timing, structure, and momentum is creating a setup too compelling to ignore. Why MAGACOINFINANCE is gaining strategic attention The bonus window is still open: Early participants have a short window to maximize their entry before public listings arrive. Momentum is quietly accelerating: Early communities are adding MAGACOINFINANCE to watchlists and positioning early. Pre-listing access remains rare: True low-exposure opportunities like this don’t stay hidden for long. Smart timing is key: This is the exact phase where major crypto stories quietly begin. MAGACOINFINANCE is showing strong growth potential With structured rollout strategies and rising early interest, MAGACOINFINANCE is being flagged by analysts as one of the most promising early-stage projects. Current projections place MAGACOINFINANCE among assets with upswing potential , based on its early phase traction, structural design, and upcoming exposure. Why LINK, DOT, MATIC, and ADA can’t match this early positioning Chainlink (LINK) , Polkadot (DOT) , Polygon (MATIC) , and Cardano (ADA) are key players, but their early-stage moments are behind them. MAGACOINFINANCE is just getting started—where strategic entries still have room for expansion and true scalability. Final thoughts on MAGACOINFINANCE The biggest moves in crypto were made before they became headlines. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP rewarded early conviction. Today, MAGACOINFINANCE is offering the same rare timing opportunity—limited access, growing strength, and strong projected upside. This is the type of early positioning smart investors wait for.

In the crypto market two projects are fighting for leadership yet only one will lead the market in 2025. Mutuum Finance introduces its ongoing phase 4 for $0.025 entry which guarantees a 140% profit when MUTM launches. The steady increase of Cardano depends on its continuous ecosystem development. The dual forces of DeFi innovation and blockchain veteran experience will create a dramatic competition for the year 2025. Cardano’s Methodical March ADA has demonstrated strong market gains by lifting its price 14.99% to $0.69 throughout the week. The mass purchase of millions of tokens by Whale wallets demonstrates their conviction about its future prospects. Two technical indicators show bullish momentum for the market because the 1.06 long-to-short ratio exists alongside an RSI that keeps rising to 57. The combination of BitcoinOS security measures with Bitcoin staking capabilities establishes conditions to attract billions in assets. The systematic engineering approach of Cardano based on peer-reviewed standards counts as a major constraint to its immediate market performance. Modern whales conducted a buy of 180 million tokens which indicates potential profit returns. Cardano faces the possibility of trailing behind in its market ascent toward $0.80 despite analyst predictions. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates at full speed as it pushes aggressively through its presale process. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Power The presale stage of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) currently exists in stage 4 of its 11-phase framework where tokens are sold at $0.025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts intense buyer demand as it collects $7.2 million from 9,100 investors through its presale launch. Phase 5 of the sale will occur soon as the current pricing will increase by 20% to $0.03 thus providing instant profits to early buyers. Tokenomics guarantees an initial pricing at $0.06 which provides 140% return during launch. Directed analysis indicates the launch value will skyrocket to $2.50 and result in a 9,900% growth over current market value. The team is finalizing a Certik audit of its smart contracts, with results soon to be shared on socials, boosting trust. This momentum positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a DeFi frontrunner. Innovative Lending Model One key decentralized feature of MUTM provides a unique framework for loans along with the accruing interest system that mtTokens generate from fund deposits which serves as passive income sources. Through the buy-and-distribute system platform revenue provides repurchased tokens to participants as rewards that occur while market demand remains unaltered. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents an updated tracking system which awards additional tokens to the top 50 token owners to strengthen their loyalty together with their rank positions. Mutuum Finance displays different operational features than the extensive blockchain development structure of Cardano. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gains rapid growth in 2025 because investors choose its return on investment offerings and financial strategy which builds community engagement. Race to the Top Mutuum Finance (MUTM) surpasses Cardano (ADA) in terms of fast presale completion as investors easily find profitable ways to invest. The price stability of Cardano maintains itself through ongoing platform development although the network expands its ecosystem continually. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s $0.025 entry, 140% launch profit, and potential $2.50 post-launch value offer unmatched upside. Those seeking 2025’s top-performing asset should move swiftly since Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will finish its phase 4 within this year.

Interestingly, Ethereum has held its ground firmly, supported by a clean uptrend that began after the sharp recovery from $1,550 that kicked off on Tuesday. Related Reading: Ethereum To Hit $5k Before Its 10th Birthday, Justin Sun Says As it stands, the Ethereum price is at an important technical phase after retesting the $1,799 resistance level and pulling back into its final intraday support zone. A fresh push above $1,800 could open the door to $1,840 and beyond, whereas deeper retracements would test three important zones. Ethereum Turns Resistance Levels Into Support Ethereum’s recent rally has seen it break past three notable resistance levels that have rejected its price action for most of April. Interestingly, these resistance levels are located at $1,590, $1,654, and $1,703, as indicated by a technical analysis of Ethereum’s price action on the hourly candlestick timeframe chart on the TradingView platform. Following these breakouts, Ethereum continued to push upward with momentum until it encountered a tougher ceiling near the $1,800 mark. After briefly tapping into this zone, the price experienced a minor rejection, retracing back towards $1,730 before finding support and beginning another gradual climb. As it stands, the resistance at $1,800 is the next level to beat in the hopes of a close above $2,000 before the end of April. Nonetheless, even if Ethereum does not reach this level, a bullish sentiment will still be in place if it manages to hold above the broken resistances, which have now turned to support on the H1 timeframe. Ethereum Could Still Be Bullish Unless $1,654 Breaks Ethereum’s outlook remains bullish as long as the newly reclaimed levels at $1,590, $1,654, and $1,703 continue to act as reliable support zones. The first zone, positioned at $1,703, represents a short-term hourly support level. This area may attract early entries, but it is high-risk and prone to breaking easily. Beneath that lies the more structurally significant support at $1,654, which is also evident on the 4-hour chart. This level is a medium-risk zone, characterized by a cleaner and sound area of demand. It has a higher probability of initiating a bounce if tested, and its preservation is important in maintaining a short-term bullish bias for Ethereum. The strongest support level is at $1,590 and is somewhat low-risk for reentry. It has the most favorable risk-to-reward ratio, where smart money traders are likely to accumulate. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Heating Up’ – Address Activity Jumps Nearly 10% In 2 Days As long as Ethereum stays above $1,703, the current uptrend remains valid. The bullish bias remains intact unless there’s a confirmed break below $1,654. A drop below the $1,654 support would shift the short-term outlook to neutral or bearish. On the other hand, a successful close above $1,800 could cascade toward the next target around $1,840 or even higher.

In 2025, the market is hotter than ever, with new coins emerging every day. However, even with all the noise surrounding Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the many altcoins, one thing is crystal clear: many missed the boat on some of the biggest crypto opportunities. Bitcoin’s price is through the roof, and Ethereum’s smart contracts are reshaping industries. But here’s the catch—these opportunities are long gone. Now, the race is on for the next breakout star. Enter Qubetics ($TICS), the cryptocurrency that might just be the next big thing to revolutionize the space. While Bitcoin once looked like the holy grail for early adopters, its massive price tag today makes it less accessible for new users. Ethereum’s gas fees? Don’t get me started. What if there was a new cryptocurrency that could solve the problems these older coins couldn’t? What if it’s still affordable to jump in now, before it becomes the next multi-billion-dollar success story? With Qubetics, that’s exactly what’s on the table. The Missed Opportunity: Bitcoin’s Meteoric Rise Looking back at Bitcoin, it’s hard not to feel a little bit of regret. Bitcoin was once just a quirky, niche project that not many folks took seriously. Fast forward a decade, and it’s the king of cryptocurrencies. Those who jumped in early have seen returns so wild that it’s almost hard to believe. But for the rest, Bitcoin’s skyrocketing price means that entering the game now feels like an impossible task. Let’s face it: Bitcoin’s rise was a missed opportunity for many. But here’s the kicker—it’s not too late to catch the next big wave. Bitcoin might have been the first, but that doesn’t mean it’s the only chance to make it big in crypto. The space is constantly evolving, and new players are stepping up. Qubetics is one of them, and right now, it’s in presale, meaning there’s still time to get in on the ground floor. Bitcoin is often referred to as the “most popular cryptocurrency,” and for good reason. It’s the leader in terms of market cap and adoption, but its limitations are clear. High transaction costs, slow processing times, and an energy-hungry proof-of-work mechanism make Bitcoin’s future uncertain in the face of more scalable and eco-friendly alternatives. That’s where Qubetics comes into play. Why Qubetics is the New Rising Star of the Crypto Space The most popular cryptocurrency of 2025 might not be the one you think. Sure, Bitcoin and Ethereum are still heavyweights, but the next wave of crypto adoption is already underway, and Qubetics is leading the charge. Why? Because it’s addressing the real-life problems that current cryptocurrencies are struggling with. Qubetics has introduced a Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet that allows users to manage assets across different blockchain networks, offering true decentralized control. Unlike traditional custodial wallets that hold your assets for you, Qubetics lets users stay in control of their own funds. And with the ability to interact with multiple chains, it’s bridging gaps that Bitcoin and Ethereum have failed to address. Real-Life Applications of Qubetics: A Game-Changer for Businesses, Professionals, and Individuals Let’s talk about how Qubetics could change lives—real lives. Imagine you’re a small business owner looking to accept payments in cryptocurrency. You don’t want the hassle of paying crazy high fees to process payments through Ethereum or Bitcoin. With Qubetics, you could accept payments on multiple blockchains with low fees, all while maintaining full control over your funds. Now, picture a professional freelancer who works with clients from all over the world. With Qubetics, they can easily send and receive payments across different networks, without worrying about excessive transaction costs or delays. That’s huge for anyone working in the gig economy or running a digital business. Whether you’re a designer, a consultant, or a digital marketer, Qubetics makes it easy to manage payments securely and efficiently. And let’s not forget about everyday users. The Qubetics wallet allows for seamless transactions across multiple blockchains, meaning users can send crypto with ease, whether it’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other assets. All of this comes with a level of security that most other wallets can’t provide. The Qubetics Presale: Get in Before It’s Too Late So, how can you take advantage of this opportunity? Well, the Qubetics presale is in full swing, and right now, you can purchase $TICS tokens for just $0.1902 per token in the 31st stage. Over 25,200 holders have already jumped in, raising more than $16.4 million. Analysts are predicting massive returns once the crypto presale ends and the token hits exchanges. Some are even predicting that the price could hit $1, $5, or even $15 after the mainnet launch. That’s a potential return of over 7,000% from the presale price! Here’s a breakdown of the price predictions: $TICS at $1 after the presale = 425% ROI $TICS at $5 after the presale = 2527% ROI $TICS at $15 after mainnet launch = 7783% ROI This is an opportunity that won’t last long. With the presale in its final stages, now’s the time to act if you want to get in before it’s too late. What’s Next for Qubetics? Analysts are extremely bullish on Qubetics, and it’s easy to see why. With a clear roadmap, an innovative multi-chain wallet, and a rapidly growing community, Qubetics is poised to make a major impact in the crypto space. Its presale success speaks volumes about the excitement and interest surrounding the project. The Qubetics community continues to grow, and as the mainnet launch approaches, the price of $TICS is expected to soar. If you missed the boat with Bitcoin or Ethereum, now’s your chance to get in early on the next big cryptocurrency. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Next Most Popular Cryptocurrency—Qubetics Looking back at the rise of Bitcoin and Ethereum, it’s easy to feel a little regretful for not getting in early. These coins were the most popular cryptocurrency of their time, and their meteoric rise made fortunes for many. But here’s the thing—just because you missed the boat on Bitcoin doesn’t mean you’re out of luck. Qubetics ($TICS) is the next big opportunity in crypto, and it’s still in presale, making it a perfect chance to get in before it becomes the next most popular cryptocurrency. With its innovative Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, low fees, and massive potential for growth, Qubetics has all the makings of a breakout star. Analysts are predicting huge returns, and with the presale gaining momentum, the time to act is now. If you missed out on Bitcoin or Ethereum, don’t let this opportunity pass you by. Qubetics is on the rise, and it could be the most popular cryptocurrency of the next crypto cycle. Don’t wait—jump on the Qubetics presale and get in early on what could be the next big crypto success story. The clock is ticking, and this opportunity won’t last forever.

Right now, that window may be opening across several major names—including MAGACOINFINANCE.COM , XRP , Solana , and Bitcoin —all of which are building undeniable momentum as 2025 approaches. In markets like these, small moves can turn into major outcomes—and the clock is ticking for those looking to position themselves before the next surge hits. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Gaining Speed—and Serious Investors Are Noticing Momentum in crypto isn’t random. It’s built on clear signals: growing wallet numbers, consistent project updates, expanding community support, and increased mentions across credible trader circles. Right now, MAGACOINFINANCE is showing all of those signals—and it’s doing so faster than most new tokens even hope to. It’s clear, it’s early, and the foundation being built is earning attention from seasoned investors who know what early-stage traction looks like. No gimmicks. No overhype. Just execution and a community that’s growing stronger with every new development. Why XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin Are Still Leading Conversations XRP has returned as a serious force in global payments, now with legal clarity boosting its ability to integrate with financial institutions. As cross-border remittance demand grows, XRP’s value proposition becomes even more critical. Solana remains unmatched in transaction speed and network scalability. With NFT ecosystems, gaming platforms, and real-world integrations accelerating, it continues to be a key player in every major crypto growth discussion. Bitcoin , the foundation of the digital asset class, keeps asserting its dominance. Institutions continue to build exposure, and retail traders still treat it as the safest macro bet in crypto. Other Rising Players: NEAR Protocol, Chainlink, Ethereum, and Aave NEAR Protocol continues to make waves with its user-friendly blockchain model, onboarding developers who are focused on seamless dApp creation. Chainlink remains a pillar of decentralized data. Its oracles power a huge segment of DePIN and on-chain asset management, keeping it absolutely essential to the ecosystem. Ethereum is the backbone of innovation. Despite Layer-2 competition, its centrality to smart contracts and DeFi ensures its continued relevance for the foreseeable future. Aave is leading decentralized lending and liquidity platforms, offering secure, innovative tools for both retail and institutional DeFi users. Each is valuable—but none are in the early-stage growth zone where MAGACOINFINANCE now thrives. Final Word $8,000 in 20 days? Crypto history shows that fast momentum can spark fast outcomes—but only for those positioned early. With MAGACOINFINANCE.COM , XRP , Solana , and Bitcoin all gaining strength, the smartest move might be stepping into the right assets before the next leg up. The momentum is already here.

After weeks of consolidation and choppy price action, POL has decisively moved above the pattern’s resistance line, breathing life back into its short-term outlook. The current momentum suggests that bulls may have their eyes set on the next key target at $0.31. With improving sentiment and technical indicators flashing bullish signals, POL appears poised to extend its recovery if buyers can sustain the pressure. From Consolidation To Acceleration: Polygon Phase Shifts In a recent tweet, Whales_Crypto_Trading highlighted a significant technical move on POL’s chart. Polygon is currently breaking above the upper boundary of a broadening wedge on the daily timeframe, which is usually a bullish signal that points to rising volatility and potential trend reversal. This pattern, widely watched by technical traders, suggests that POL may be gearing up for a sustained upside push. Related Reading: Nearly All POL Holders At A Loss—What Does It Mean For The Market? The analyst further noted that if momentum continues to build, POL could see a notable move toward the $0.52 mark. This level represents a midterm projection based on the size of the breakout from the wedge formation. A 2x gain from current levels would attract bullish attention and position POL back in line with previous consolidation zones. With the breakout accompanied by improving sentiment and growing volume, Polygon appears to be setting the stage for a stronger rally. Presently, speculations are whether bulls can maintain the price above the breakout level and continue defending short-term support. If that happens, POL’s next chapter could be defined by renewed momentum and wider investor interest. Measured Moves And Extended Targets While $0.31 stands as the immediate upside target following the breakout, the broadening wedge pattern hints that the Polygon rally may not stop there. Breakouts from such structures often extend beyond initial resistance zones, especially when supported by strong volume and positive momentum indicators. Related Reading: Polygon Q4 Digest: Agglayer Testnet Launch Drives 30% Spike In POL Market Cap If bullish pressure remains steady, the next areas to watch would be near $0.44 and $0.52, both of which align with previous reaction points and Fibonacci extensions. These levels could act as zones where short-term traders might take profits, but they also offer opportunities for the trend to build new higher highs. Despite the upward momentum surrounding POL’s breakout, risks still linger beneath the surface. One major concern is the possibility of a false breakout if the price fails to hold above the $0.31 mark, attracting strong selling pressure and trapping late buyers. This would invalidate the breakout and may trigger a swift pullback toward lower support levels.

With its recent break in tight price action, a crypto analyst believes that XRP could be preparing to surge above $8, marking a new ATH for the top altcoin. XRP Price Aims For $8 Target In Coming Months After months of constrained price action, the XRP price has finally broken out of a descending consolidation pattern—a bullish signal that the market has been eagerly awaiting. Following this breakout, XRP is now eyeing a potential rally toward the $8.08 mark. Related Reading: Ethereum ‘Heating Up’ – Address Activity Jumps Nearly 10% In 2 Days Delving deeper into the technical chart analysis published by TradingView crypto analyst Master Ananda, XRP is now comfortably trading above crucial Moving Averages (MA), including the EMA9, EMA10, EMA20, EMA25, EMA50, and most importantly, the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The Exponential Moving Averages indicate a short to medium-term bullishness for XRP. At the same time, the 200-day SMA is the most critical and long-term bullish signal. Key Fibonacci Extension levels confirm the breakout from the descending consolidation pattern. In alignment with its projected rise to $8.08, XRP is expected to surge past three critical price targets: the 1.618 Fib at $4.5, the 2.618 Fib around $6.29 and finally, the 3.618 Fib, which corresponds with the $8.08 price level. Notably, a surge to $8.08 would represent more than double XRP’s current all-time high of $3.84, marking a 1,380% increase from its current market value. The analyst’s chart highlights a clear breakout trajectory, emphasizing a steady upward pace with the reversal point already confirmed. For its short-term price targets, Master Ananda has shared four key Fibonacci Extension levels: the 0.382 Fib at $2.29, the 0.5 Fib at $2.5, the 0.618 Fib at $2.71, and finally, the 0.786 Fib at $3.01. Notably, the analyst has also highlighted the $3.4 level as a “high” resistance level for XRP. Breaking above this price would be another huge bullish confirmation that XRP can move toward the $8.08 projected target. Analyst: Exercise Patience Ahead Of Surge Despite his bullish stance on XRP’s future price outlook, Master Ananda has advised investors and traders to remain patient and exercise caution. While XRP is showing clear signs of growth, it’s important to note that this projected surge will not happen overnight. The TradingView analyst has stated that XRP’s journey toward the price range between $6-$8 would span several months, not just weeks, as the market gradually stabilizes and bullish momentum continues to build. Related Reading: Ethereum To Hit $5k Before Its 10th Birthday, Justin Sun Says Although market volatility could still test XRP’s price action, the breakout from the SMA200 confirms that the cryptocurrency has entered a multi-month bullish phase.

We need to turn on the lights and build some walkways over the lava pit,” Peirce said at the SEC “Know Your Custodian” roundtable event on April 25. The lava is crypto, says Peirce Peirce explained that SEC registrants are forced to approach crypto-related activities like “the floor is lava,” where the aim is to jump from one piece of furniture to the next without touching the ground, except here, touching crypto directly is the lava. “A D.C. version of this game is our regulatory approach to crypto assets, and crypto asset custody in particular,” she said. Peirce said that, much like in the game, firms wanting to engage with crypto must avoid directly holding it due to unclear regulatory rules. “To engage in crypto-related activities, SEC-registrants have had to hop from one poorly illuminated regulatory space to the next, all while ensuring that they never touch any crypto asset,” Peirce said. Source: US Securities and Exchange Commission Peirce said that investment advisers are often unsure which crypto assets qualify as securities, what entities count as qualified custodians, and whether “exercising staking or voting rights” could trigger custody violations. “The twist in the regulatory version is that it is largely played in the dark: burning legal lava and no lamps to illuminate the way.” Peirce also said that a broker or ATS that cannot custody or manage crypto assets will struggle to facilitate trading, making it unlikely for a “robust market” to develop. Echoing a similar sentiment, SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda said at the event that as more SEC registrants work with crypto assets, it’s essential that they have access to custodial options that meet legal and regulatory requirements. Uyeda said the agency should consider letting advisers use “state-chartered limited-purpose trust companies” with the authority to hold crypto assets as qualified custodians. Related: Blockchain needs regulation, scalability to close AI hiring gap Meanwhile, the recently sworn-in chair of the SEC, Paul Atkins, said that he expected “huge benefits” from blockchain technology through efficiency, risk mitigation, transparency, and cutting costs. He reiterated that among his goals at the SEC would be to facilitate “clear regulatory rules of the road” for digital assets, hinting that the agency under former chair Gary Gensler had contributed to market and regulatory uncertainty. “I look forward to engaging with market participants and working with colleagues in President Trump’s administration and Congress to establish a rational fit-for-purpose framework for crypto assets,” said Atkins.

While the price of BTC continues to hold above the critical $94,000 level, the premier cryptocurrency seems to be losing some momentum. Unsurprisingly, investors appear to be increasingly confident in the promise of this recent rally, as significant amounts of BTC continue to make their way off major centralized exchanges over the past few days. Here’s how much investors have moved in the past few days. Over 35,000 BTC Move Out Of Coinbase And Binance In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, crypto analyst João Wedson revealed that Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has seen increased activity over the past few days. The exchange netflow data shows that huge amounts of Bitcoin have been withdrawn from the platform in recent days. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees 4th Dip in Funding Rates This Year — What Does This Mean For BTC? According to CryptoQuant data, a total of 27,750 BTC (worth $2.63 billion at current price) was moved out of Binance on Friday, April 25. This latest round of withdrawals represents the third-largest net outflow in the centralized exchange’s history. The movement of significant crypto amounts from exchanges, which offer services like selling to non-custodial wallets, suggests a potential shift in investor sentiment and strategy. Large exchange outflows often signal increased confidence of holders in the long-term potential of an asset. Wedson noted that the recent outflows do not guarantee a price rally for Bitcoin, but they do signal strong institutional activity, which is often a precursor for major volatility. Citing China’s crypto ban in 2021, the crypto analyst highlighted how massive exchange outflows didn’t prevent the dump. At the same time, Wedson mentioned that the continuous Bitcoin outflows over several days, like during the FTX collapse, preceded a price bottom and the eventual market recovery. Ultimately, the online pundit hinted at paying close attention to the overall trend of the exchange netflow rather than a single-day activity. Similarly, more than 7,000 BTC (worth approximately $66.5 million) have made their way out of the Coinbase exchange. According to the CryptoQuant analyst Amr Taha, this negative exchange netflow could be an indicator of increased institutional activity, as Coinbase is known as the primary crypto vendor for US-based institutions. Taha said: These large outflows typically suggest accumulation by institutions or large investors, potentially signaling bullish sentiment. The analyst outlined that if the dwindling exchange reserves correlate with an increased spot demand or ETF inflows, a supply squeeze could be on the horizon, potentially pushing the price to the upside. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just beneath $95,200, reflecting an almost 2% increase in the past 24 hours. Related Reading: Is The XRP Price Rally Over At $2.22?

Jacobs said geopolitical tensions and growing global uncertainty are accelerating diversification strategies among central banks in different countries. He pointed to a long-term trend in which nations are reducing their reliance on dollar reserves in favor of assets such as gold and, increasingly, bitcoin. ”This whole diversification away from traditional assets towards gold and cryptocurrencies [...] started three to four years ago,” Jacobs explained, adding that the recent fragmentation of the world has increased the desire for alternative means of saving. The BlackRock representative mentioned growing concerns about the freezing in the West of $300 billion in assets of the Russian central bank. In his view, such events have forced countries such as China to rethink their reserve strategies. Geopolitical fragmentation as a defining force During the interview, Jacobs said that BlackRock has identified multipolarity as a key force that will influence global markets over the next few decades: ”We've really identified geopolitical fragmentation as a key force that will be a global driver over the next few decades.” He noted that this environment is fueling demand for non-correlated stock market assets, with bitcoin increasingly seen alongside gold as a safe haven asset. ”We've seen significant inflows into gold ETFs, we've seen significant inflows into bitcoin. And it's all because people are looking for assets with independent market behavior,” Jacobs said. Bitcoin is separating from the stock market Notably, Jacobs is not the only one to emphasize bitcoin's declining correlation with U.S. stocks. Several analysts have also noted that the first cryptocurrency is starting to separate from the US stock market. On April 22, Alex Svanevik, co-founder and CEO of crypto platform Nansen, stated that the bitcoin price is showing growing maturity as a global asset, becoming ”less Nasdaq and more like gold.” He added that bitcoin has proven ”remarkably resilient” in the face of the trade war compared to altcoins and indices like the S&P 500, although it remains vulnerable to economic recession fears. Echoing that view, QCP Capital in an April 21 report shared gold's fame as a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty. ”With stock markets ending last week in the red, continuing April's decline, the narrative of bitcoin as a protective asset or inflation hedging tool is gaining traction again. If this momentum continues, it could provide further impetus for institutional bitcoin investment,” summarizes QCP Capital.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-27 05:08:48

Up more than 11% over the last seven days and with a market cap hovering just under $1.88 trillion, BTC has social media ablaze with shouts of $100K+ price predictions, even as some seasoned voices warn retail traders to tread carefully. $103K on the Cards Analyst Titan of Crypto ignited the bullish case, claiming a “bull flag” breakout is underway, and predicting a short-term move to $103,000 in a post on X. The asset’s recent price movement coincided with substantial accumulation by large investors. According to Santiment, wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC have been aggressively adding to their positions, with Bitcoin advocate Kyle Chassé calling it “THE STRONGEST SIGNAL IN THE GAME!!!” Santiment also revealed that market sentiment has reached its most greed-dominated level since November 2024, when the flagship cryptocurrency last peaked before correcting 13%. The analytics platform suggested whales were ready to mop up any BTC offloaded by profit-seeking retail traders in this period, potentially giving the asset a leg up past $100,000: “If they sell here because they think we are seeing a top, whales would likely scoop up those coins and potentially push Bitcoin above $100K in the next 1-2 weeks.” Some prominent market watchers have also highlighted key technical developments, including Daan Crypto Trades, who observed Bitcoin’s resilience at key Fibonacci levels. “$BTC Strong bounce and continuation from the .382 Fibonacci Retracement level,” he stated, expressing his fondness for “higher timeframe trends.” Bull Cycle Incoming? Adding to the narrative, Michaël van de Poppe suggested the market might be entering a major bull cycle. He cited a chart by TechDev_52 showing that BTC has been in its longest bear run, lasting four years, and implied a reverse cycle was imminent. “We’re about to start the biggest bull cycle ever,” the crypto investor wrote. However, the Santiment team offered a more cautious perspective, noting that excessive crowd greed might lead to a local top formation, while more measured behavior could allow BTC to maintain its divergence from traditional markets like the S&P 500. With its dominance holding at 61.2% and institutional interest remaining strong, the cryptocurrency’s next move could set the tone for the rest of the digital asset market in the next week.

Source: X.com As illustrated in the chart, Bitcoin is currently in the “Transition” range, where BTC accumulation occurs. Once it breaks into the “Acceleration” zone, the crypto asset enters the rally's 33% to 66% range , progressively targeting $106,000, $130,000, and $163,000 over the next few months. However, anonymous Bitcoin analyst apsk32 predicted BTC’s price target could be as high as $200,000 in 2025. The prediction is based on ""Bitcoin power curve time contours,"" which overlay Bitcoin’s price movements across four-year cycles (2013, 2017, 2021, and 2025). The chart suggests a strong performance in Q3 and Q4 of 2025, with the analyst noting that Bitcoin’s historical four-year cycle remains intact. The analyst said, “Looking at two-year segments centered today, 4, 8, and 12 years ago. Price scaling performed using the power curve trendline. Expecting $200,000+ Bitcoin in Q4.

Cointelegraph reported that BTC tends to follow gold’s directional bias with a lag of 100-150 days. Based on that narrative, it is possible that Bitcoin could lead gold in the coming weeks. Similarly, the US Dollar Index (DXY) dropped to a new three-year low on April 21, which further fueled the likelihood of a rally for risk assets. Cointelegraph reported that multi-year DXY lows have been historically bullish for Bitcoin. Crypto analyst ‘Venture Founder’ also pointed out , “Traditionally, DXY going down is very bullish for $BTC, we now have a massive bearish divergence for DXY, which may suggest it goes to 90.

Progress may be gradual, but it’s undeniable. https://t.co/QxWbJRPhMq pic.twitter.com/9lbnZjaTHz — XForceGlobal (@XForceGlobal) April 24, 2025 Price Targets Range From $10 To $40 XForceGlobal’s analysis puts XRP in wave 2 of a bigger fifth wave, indicating the next big move would be a strong wave 3. The analyst has had a minimum target of $10, which would be a 350% rise from current levels. His upper target of $40 would be an unprecedented 1,726% rise. The prediction relies on Elliott Wave Theory, which tries to foresee market movements through patterns of investor sentiment expressing themselves in price waves. The predictions rely on the strength and expansion of waves 3 and 5 within the overall structure of the market. Korean Markets Act As Leading Indicators XForceGlobal pointed out that Korean cryptocurrency exchanges play a vital role in the prediction of XRP price fluctuations. In the opinion of the analyst, Korean markets have in the past led in the recognition of significant XRP tops and bottoms. The similarity between XRP’s Korean won (KRW) chart and its US dollar chart was highlighted as especially significant. “We’re seeing the same structure on both charts. That adds conviction that wave 2 may be complete,” the analyst said.

The analyst indicated that “smart money” is already accumulating in XRP as retail interest starts coming back. XForceGlobal compared the strength of XRP’s community against the reported dwindling enthusiasm for Ethereum and Solana. The last stage of this cycle might involve a vertical, parabolic price action, perhaps initiating a new wave of FOMO among investors.

Here’s the Next Stop",https://timestabloid.com/expert-outlines-xrp-path-to-1000-heres-the-next-stop/,"BarriC (@B_arri_C), a prominent voice in the cryptocurrency space, has presented a bold forecast for the price of XRP, laying out a staged projection that begins with the asset hitting $3 and culminating in a long-term stabilization at $1,000. The prediction starts with XRP reaching $3 before rising quickly to $5 . According to BarriC, this initial phase would be followed by a surge to the $10–$20 range, driven by the heightened momentum and volatility typically associated with an altcoin season. This progression is portrayed not as a sudden spike but as a sequence of price actions building on broader market dynamics. $XRP starts by hitting $3 Then $XRP skyrockets from $3 to $5 Then as the volatility and momentum of an alt season kicks in $XRP skyrockets to $10-$20 Once we have entered into double digit #XRP territory we may see the market dip back down into a bear market However towards… — BarriC (@B_arri_C) April 24, 2025 The Solution to a Bear Market BarriC suggests that after XRP enters double-digit pricing, the market could retreat into a bear phase. However, the forecast maintains that the broader trajectory remains upward, especially if specific catalysts take shape. One of the critical drivers identified is the institutional adoption of blockchain and XRP by banks. BarriC notes that if this materializes by late 2025, it could set the stage for a dramatic increase in XRP’s valuation, with a potential move to $100 . From there, the projection becomes significantly more ambitious. BarriC envisions a scenario where global financial institutions begin routing substantial volumes of capital through XRP. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP Journey to $1,000 In this scenario, he anticipates a parabolic rise that could push the asset’s value to $1,000. The implication is that such institutional utility would fundamentally transform XRP’s market position, reducing volatility and establishing $1,000 as a baseline value. Another crypto expert recently explained why banks will need XRP for liquidity as the global financial system evolves, and he believes this demand could send the asset to $1,000 . BarriC asserts that once the digital asset reaches this stage, the days of price fluctuations and affordable entry points will be over. “Say goodbye to cheap XRP,” he states, arguing that the token would stabilize permanently above the $1,000 level. This outlook hinges on several pivotal developments: the sustained growth of altcoin markets, a return of bullish sentiment following a potential bear phase, and most importantly, widespread institutional endorsement. While the projection remains speculative, it outlines a clearly defined vision for the digital asset and is built on its potential to dominate global finance. The asset is currently trading at $2.19, and now investors are watching out for the next move to the $3-$5 range.

While Bitcoin (BTC) has surged over 11% this week, reaching a new high of $94,671 and approaching the $100,000 mark, XRP has only managed a 6.56% gain. It continues to struggle near the $2.21 level, facing persistent resistance and failing to reflect the broader market’s recovery. Nonetheless, some analysts remain optimistic about the token’s long-term potential, with a few projecting the possibility of the asset eventually reaching a price of $100. Could XRP Realistically Hit $100? Although more conservative price targets, such as $10 and $27, appear more plausible soon, some market commentators have suggested that XRP could reach as high as $100 under the right conditions. Last year, crypto analyst Levi Rietveld expressed strong confidence in this outcome, and more recently, analyst BarriC stated that investors may one day be willing to pay $100 per token. However, this projection raises questions about the asset’s potential market capitalization. The asset has a total supply of approximately 99 billion tokens. At $100 per token, this would result in a fully diluted market capitalization of $9.9 trillion, far exceeding Bitcoin’s current valuation of roughly $1.9 trillion and surpassing the entire global crypto market cap, which currently stands around $3 trillion. Such a figure would even overtake the estimated $22 trillion value of all the gold in the world, casting serious doubt on the feasibility of such a high price. Addressing the Supply Barrier One potential path to reducing XRP’s market cap at higher price levels involves decreasing the total token supply. A commonly proposed solution has been the burning of Ripple’s escrow balance, which currently holds around 36.8 billion XRP, according to XRPScan. Burning this stash would reduce the circulating and total potential supply, potentially leading to higher valuations. Still, Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has discouraged this approach . He points to the 2019 example of Stellar, which destroyed a portion of its token supply without achieving significant price gains. As such, the effectiveness of supply reduction in boosting price remains uncertain. An alternative idea, discussed within the community, involves donating the escrowed XRP to the U.S. government, following former President Donald Trump’s recent remarks about XRP being included in a national crypto reserve. While symbolically impactful, the practical implications of this action on price dynamics are still unclear. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Broader Market Growth as a Key Factor Even with a reduced supply, achieving a $100 valuation for the token would require substantial expansion of the entire cryptocurrency market. If XRP’s total supply were cut to 63 billion tokens and reached $100 per token, the resulting market cap would be $6.3 trillion. For XRP to account for just 6% of the total market, the global crypto market would need to grow to around $113.33 trillion. For comparison, if Bitcoin maintained its current dominance level of about 64.5%, it would command a $73.13 trillion market cap in this scenario. Divided across its 21 million coin supply, this would equate to a BTC price of around $3.4 million. Interestingly, this aligns with a forecast made by VanEck in 2024, which predicted Bitcoin could reach $3 million by 2050. While the notion of XRP reaching $100 is not entirely impossible, it is highly improbable without extraordinary changes in XRP’s tokenomics and the size of the global crypto market. Achieving this goal would require a substantial reduction in supply and unprecedented market growth. Until then, more modest price targets remain the most reasonable expectations for the foreseeable future. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Many altcoins have produced even more painful declines over the past 24 hours, including SOL, DOGE, ADA, and SHIB. BTC Rally Paused It was a great week for the primary cryptocurrency. It began on Monday with a breakout from the short-term upper range boundary at $86,000 that sent BTC above $87,000. The asset continued its run on Tuesday and it finally jumped past $90,000 – for the first time since early March. After a minor retracement, BTC kept climbing and tapped $92,000 on Wednesday. The culmination came on Friday when the bulls really stepped up on the gas pedal and sent the cryptocurrency flying to just shy of $96,000. This became its highest price in exactly two months. The weekend has been a lot calmer , as bitcoin failed to overcome that resistance despite another attempt earlier on Sunday. As of now, though, BTC remains around two grand away from its local peak. Its market capitalization has slipped below $1.870 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 61.3%. BTCUSD.

In contrast, some of yesterday’s top performers, such as PEPE and SHIB, have dropped by well over 5% each. ADA, SOL, DOGE, LINK, AVAX, and XRP are also in the red.

Right now, serious investors are putting their attention on four names that could define the next wave: XRP , Cardano , Bitcoin , and the fast-rising MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . While market leaders continue to perform, it’s the early-stage opportunities like MAGACOINFINANCE that offer the most dramatic potential for wealth creation—and the clock is already ticking. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Moving From Undiscovered to Unmissable Some tokens launch and fade away. MAGACOINFINANCE is doing the opposite—growing stronger every week. Early wallet activity is up. Community momentum is accelerating. And investor circles that usually move carefully are starting to take positions quietly, ahead of wider exposure. It’s not hype—it’s structure, execution, and steadily increasing relevance. The project is behaving exactly the way past winners have behaved in their infancy: consistent communication, strategic expansion, and a user base that isn’t flipping short-term—it’s growing long-term. Other Movers Gaining Traction: Solana, Toncoin, Optimism, and Sei Solana has come back into focus with surging transaction volumes, real-world dApp adoption, and high-speed performance metrics. Toncoin is rapidly carving out a niche in mobile-first blockchain development, offering easy entry points for non-crypto-native users. Optimism continues to lead Ethereum’s Layer-2 scaling push, making transactions cheaper and faster without sacrificing security. Sei is gaining recognition for its performance-first architecture, designed to optimize trading and financial application experiences. Each of these assets is strong—but when it comes to early-stage asymmetrical opportunity, MAGACOINFINANCE is drawing more eyes by the day. Final Word From $777 to $777K? It sounds bold—but in crypto, bold outcomes come from bold early moves. XRP , Cardano , and Bitcoin will continue to anchor serious portfolios. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is giving investors the rare opportunity to move early—before it becomes the next name everyone’s chasing.

The regret of not jumping in early when it was dirt cheap still stings for many in the crypto community. Those who hesitated watched it explode into one of the most talked-about chains of the last few years. If you’ve found yourself haunted by charts that soared without you, you’re definitely not alone. But here’s the kicker—opportunities like that don’t just disappear forever. They reappear in different forms. And right now, another major player might be loading up that rocket, waiting for the next price launch. Enter Qubetics . This isn’t just some overhyped token—it’s designed with utility, real-world application, and scalability baked into its framework. Since launching its presale quietly in late 2024, Qubetics has built serious traction, moving through stage after stage with price hikes that are turning heads. The token is still priced under $0.20, but that’s not going to last much longer. With each stage lasting just 7 days and locking in a fixed 10% price increase, the FOMO is real. Missed Solana? Then don’t sleep on Qubetics—one of the top cryptos to invest in april 2025 while the presale window is still wide open. Qubetics Could Be the Comeback You Needed: One of the Top Cryptos to Invest in April 2025 Let’s be real—if you missed Qubetics at the whitelist price of $0.01, you’re not the only one. That was back in September 2024, and early adopters didn’t even have to drop money upfront to lock in that entry. Since then, the presale has gone through multiple price stages, and right now, it’s sitting at $0.1902 in Stage 31. Over $16.4 million has already been raised, with more than 509 million $TICS sold to a strong base of 25,200+ holders. The presale model is laser-focused: each stage lasts only a week, with a 10% price bump every new round. The Qubetics presale still has room to grow, but time is the only luxury you’re short on. Let’s break it down. A $1,000 investment in Qubetics today would get you 5,256 tokens. If $TICS hits just $1 post-mainnet, that’s $5,255.90—already a 425.53% return. But if it reaches $5, you’re sitting on $26,279.50. At $10, that shoots to $52,558.90. And if you’re in it for the long haul? A $15 valuation turns that initial $1,000 into a jaw-dropping $78,838.50. Those numbers aren’t pipe dreams—they’re grounded in Qubetics’ development timeline, with the mainnet launch scheduled for Q2 2025 and over 12.85% of its total supply set aside for the community through the presale. That’s what makes this one of the top cryptos to invest in april 2025—because the current stage still offers affordability paired with real upside. So what makes Qubetics different from other presales that fizzle out post-launch? One word: interoperability. Qubetics isn’t building another siloed blockchain. It’s solving one of crypto’s biggest headaches—making networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin actually communicate in a decentralized, frictionless way. Think of a freelance developer working across multiple platforms, or a gaming company wanting to bridge NFTs from one ecosystem to another without extra gas fees or centralization bottlenecks. Qubetics allows seamless data, asset, and transaction transfer across chains, with validators selected through Delegated Proof of Stake to keep things quick and secure. Businesses can now tap into multiple chains through a single interface, unlocking performance, utility, and cost efficiency. From DeFi to real estate, that use case alone puts Qubetics among the top cryptos to invest in april 2025 . Solana’s Moon Mission: You Blinked, It Launched Solana is the classic “you should’ve bought when…” story. Launched in 2020 with an ICO price of just $0.22, it didn’t take long before it made its mark. By November 2021, it had reached an all-time high of $260+—an absolutely insane return for early community members. The ones who believed in Solana’s vision of ultra-fast, low-fee transactions backed by proof-of-history tech didn’t just ride a wave—they practically surfed through one of the most profitable chapters in crypto history. And the irony? Many watched from the sidelines, too skeptical to move while it was under $5. What separates Solana from other chains is how it disrupted Ethereum’s dominance in transaction throughput and developer activity. NFTs, DeFi apps, Web3 games—all found fertile ground on Solana, backed by its speed and low gas fees. The growth was so rapid that even outages and criticism couldn’t hold it back for long. Solana has now cemented its position in the top tier, with a community that spans institutional partners, developers, and high-volume dApps. But if you’re looking at Solana now, you’re probably thinking, “Well, it’s already made its run.” And you’re right—it’s not early-stage anymore. The boat hasn’t just left the dock—it’s halfway across the ocean. That’s exactly why looking into the top cryptos to invest in april 2025 like Qubetics is the move that can rewrite your crypto story. Final Thoughts: Don’t Miss This One—Join This Best Crypto Presale Before It’s Gone Crypto doesn’t wait for hesitation. It rewards those who see the next breakout before it breaks. Solana gave people life-changing returns, but the window closed fast. Now, Qubetics is laying down the same tracks—community-focused, technically sound, and gaining momentum every week. With the price still in presale at just $0.1902 and a massive 10% discount between each 7-day stage, you’ve still got the chance to be early, not just early-ish. This might just be your last clean shot at getting in before the narrative catches on. If you’re serious about exploring the top cryptos to invest in april 2025, this isn’t one to delay on. Because the moment Qubetics goes live with its mainnet in Q2 2025, and real-world usage starts ramping up, the returns won’t be hypothetical anymore—they’ll be headlines. So act smart. Join this best crypto presale while the window’s still wide open and the price hasn’t spiked past what you can afford.

The analyst said, “In 2021, massive outflows didn’t prevent the dump triggered by China’s crypto ban (April–May).

SMQKE pointed out that this transaction could accelerate the distribution of RLUSD, Ripple’s stablecoin, and enhance the adoption of the XRP Ledger (XRPL). According to SMQKE, RLUSD would “use XRP to help add liquidity,” giving Ripple a pathway to challenge dominant players like Tether and Circle. Yes, Ripple’s Hidden Road acquisition will expand RLUSD distribution and adoption of the XRPL, positioning it to eventually surpass Tether and Circle as a leading stablecoin. “For Ripple there are IMMEDIATE AND LONGER TERM PLAYS” “RLUSD would use XRP to help add… pic.twitter.com/oL51kJtsjJ — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) April 25, 2025 Details of the Acquisition On April 8, 2025, Ripple announced the $1.25 billion acquisition of Hidden Road, a technology-driven prime brokerage firm based in New York. Hidden Road, founded in 2018, provides services to over 300 institutional clients, offering prime brokerage services in foreign exchange, precious metals, digital assets, and derivatives. By acquiring Hidden Road, Ripple gains direct access to a significant client base and prime brokerage infrastructure that it could leverage for RLUSD distribution. This move follows Ripple’s December 2024 launch of its RLUSD stablecoin, aimed at institutional use. The stablecoin is designed to integrate XRP for added liquidity, an important factor as Ripple works to build stronger foundations for its crypto offerings in traditional finance (TradFi) markets. Strategic Value for Ripple and Hidden Road The document shared by SMQKE shows that the acquisition unlocks substantial opportunities for both firms. The deal provides the needed capital for Hidden Road to expand in the lending sector. For Ripple, it creates an immediate network for stablecoin distribution and opens new avenues in the TradFi space. Ripple’s move is critical because, while it launched RLUSD, USDT, and USDC remain deeply entrenched as the dominant stablecoins. The acquisition of Hidden Road allows Ripple to position RLUSD and the XRPL as serious competitors, offering an established distribution network at a time when the TradFi crypto market is still developing.

The transaction is expected to have effects beyond Ripple itself. The document shared by SMQKE noted that “more and more firms who were on the sidelines are now engaged,” predicting increased market activity over the coming quarters. Ripple’s acquisition of Hidden Road is not just a financial maneuver; it is a calculated step to expand RLUSD distribution, strengthen XRP’s institutional adoption, and directly challenge the dominance of existing stablecoin leaders. The strategic rationale is clear. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has revealed plans to make RLUSD one of the top five stablecoins in the market by the end of 2025. By controlling a prime broker and stablecoin simultaneously, the company gains a competitive edge in the growing tokenized TradFi economy.

Ripple CEO on Futures Launch Impact,https://timestabloid.com/new-era-for-xrp-ripple-ceo-on-futures-launch-impact/,"Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has expressed enthusiasm about the upcoming launch of XRP futures on CME Group’s trading platform, calling it a significant and long-awaited step for the cryptocurrency’s future. In a recent statement, Garlinghouse highlighted that while the token has existed since 2012 and has seen increased trading volumes, the delay in launching futures products on leading derivative platforms like CME Group has been noticeable. The Ripple CEO views the introduction of XRP futures as a vital move that could bring more professional investors into the market. He believes XRP futures contracts will provide a regulated way for investors to access XRP, paving the way for future developments, including a possible XRP spot ETF. While overdue in a bunch of ways, this is an incredibly important and exciting step in the continued growth of the XRP market! https://t.co/mnwJXKH5hi — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) April 24, 2025 CME Group officially confirmed that it will introduce XRP futures on its platform on May 19, pending approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This new offering enables investors to bet on XRP’s price fluctuations without owning the cryptocurrency or requiring a blockchain wallet. The XRP futures product will come in two contract sizes. The standard XRP futures contract will offer exposure to 50,000 tokens, targeting institutional investors. Meanwhile, the Micro XRP futures contract, with a smaller contract size of 2,500 XRP, is designed for retail investors. Both products will be cash-settled, meaning investors will receive a cash payment rather than physical XRP once the contract expires. CME Joins Other U.S. Platforms in Offering XRP Futures The announcement of CME Group’s XRP futures launch follows similar moves by other U.S.-based derivatives exchanges. Bitnomial began offering XRP futures on March 20, and Coinbase launched its own XRP futures product on April 21. CME’s move is especially significant given its status as the world’s largest derivatives exchange. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 For context, CME Group is already home to futures products tied to Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. In the first quarter of 2025, CME saw an average of 198,000 contracts traded across these products. The introduction of XRP futures on CME Group’s platform is expected to boost the asset’s credibility, potentially expanding its institutional investor base. XRP Futures May Pave the Way for an XRP ETF The launch of XRP futures by CME Group could play a crucial role in the approval of an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) typically considers the availability of a futures product as a key factor in approving a crypto asset for a spot ETF. A similar path was taken for Bitcoin and Ethereum, where the SEC approved spot ETFs following the introduction of their futures products. Garlinghouse’s statement reflects optimism about the positive impact of XRP futures on the asset’s growth trajectory. With increasing institutional exposure to the asset, the long-awaited futures product could mark a key milestone in the token’s evolution as a mainstream asset.

But the past week has not just been wild for BTC, the market bouncing back impressively across the segments, a bullish outlook that has investors taking aggressive steps towards positioning for a bull cycle continuation. While tariff-related uncertainty lingers, Sui and Bitcoin Pepe rank among the best crypto to buy today. Bitcoin: Analysts say demand is back Bitcoin is flexing its muscles again, breaking higher after dipping to lows of $74k earlier in April. There’s overall bullish sentiment that BTC is back to winning ways and could explode in coming months. Recently, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest predicted the crypto king could swell to $2.4 million in the next five years. Other than this long term outlook, CryptoQuant analysts have shared details that suggest Bitcoin’s short term performance is also likely on the up. They pointed to a return to demand for the benchmark asset, which many predictions put as $150k-$250k by the end of the year.

Catalysts could include exchange-traded funds (as inflows recover), regulatory clarity and macroeconomic factors. Bitcoin was poised around $94,200 on April 26, 2025. Sui – an emerging force in the altcoin market? Ethereum and Solana dominate the developer market. However, a new force in the space amid growth in decentralized finance, crypto infra and gaming is Sui. Increasingly a go-to blockchain for developers across DeFi and web3 gaming, the native SUI token stands out as one of best performing tokens. Profit taking saw it retreat from its ATH of $5.35 reached in January 2025. The 34% dip now offers another buy opportunity, with price currently at $3.50 and 7% down in the past 24 hours. Analysts are predicting that a rallying Bitcoin, Ethereum or Solana could help SUI price. Bitcoin Pepe: The memecoin with BTC and SOL momentum? New opportunities abound in the crypto market, and savvy investors know where to look. However, one of the sectors where one can unearth gems is the presale market. Due diligence and understanding of risk-reward are key. Notably, a coin in presale and attracting significant attention is Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP). Bitcoin Pepe @BitcoinPepe_ · Follow The OG chain can never die. 2:30 pm · 17 Apr 2025 53 Reply Copy link Read 10 replies Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and even Official Trump (TRUMP) are all seeing notable demand. But unlike Bitcoin Pepe, these are typical memecoins that rely on viral trends or events. BPEP differs slightly. Not only is it the first BTC meme ICO, it’s building Solana on Bitcoin. It looks to dominate the resilient meme market by tapping into the security and robust network of Bitcoin and low cost and high speed of Solana. The PEP-20 standard will let anyone launch meme coins on a layer-2 solution, with other roadmap milestones key to growth. Currently, Bitcoin Pepe is priced at just $0.031, offering an early bird opportunity as presale crosses the $7 million mark. Apart from having offered a potential 311% gain to stage 1 presale buyers, the token sale will likely explode post-presale to mirror other top memecoin gainers. A 20x, 50x or even 100x is possible. The $0.031 price could be a great entry point especially as BTC is expected to rally in 2025. Interested in learning more? Visit the official Bitcoin Pepe website .

Despite a bullish trading week, which saw the altcoin trade at $2.29, the market expert explains that XRP is yet to confirm a market bottom, indicating the potential of a future price fall. Related Reading: SUI Primed For Market Correction – Analyst Sets Target At $2.75 Crucial Times Ahead: XRP Must Break $2.33–$2.45 To Invalidate Bearish Forecast In an X post on April 26, Egrag Crypto shared a bearish forecast on the XRP market, suggesting a potential downswing lies on the horizon. Based on the technical analysis of the XRP trading chart, altcoin appears to be trading below the Bull Market Support Band despite recent gains due to the extensive price correction in Q1 2025. For context, the Bull Market Support Band is a price zone formed from two moving averages to help traders detect whether an asset remains in a bull market or not. When prices fall below this support band, it often signals a bear market risk. For XRP to invalidate this negative forecast, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency must close above $2.33, which represents the immediate resistance level. Importantly, XRP must reclaim the $2.45, which currently acts as the upper edge of the Bull Market Support Band. Achieving a decisive close above both critical price levels would signal a strong market demand and reduce fear of a larger price correction. However, if XRP fails to break above this band soon, the 0.702 Fibonacci level around $1.25 becomes a likely potential target. Egrag Crypto explains that this Fibonacci level aligns with the previous breakout structure, thus making it a strong historical support. However, a price fall to $1.25 would only constitute a major retest, which could reinforce the long-term bullish structure of the XRP market. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Reaches Last H1 Support, Next Major Resistance Comes Into View XRP Price Overview At the time of writing, XRP trades at $2.18, reflecting a decline of 0.78% in the last day. The prominent altcoin is also down 5.08% on the monthly chart, indicating that bearish pressures are still strong in the market. According to data from Coincodex, market sentiment currently remains neutral, with investors still uncertain of XRP’s future. Notably, only 40% of XRP’s last 30 trading days have been profitable. Interestingly, Coincodex analysts expect the asset to retain its recent bullish form in the short term to potentially trade at $2.50 in five days. However, they remain highly bearish on long-term prospects, projecting a price of $1.97 in one month and $1.65 in three months.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Swissblock says that Bitcoin is now “playing in its own league” after BTC held its ground amid a severe stock market sell-off this month. According to Swissblock, Bitcoin looks to be playing the part of a safe-haven asset in the midst of market uncertainty stemming from President Trump’s trade war. “Bitcoin’s decoupling from equities is confirmed: Even if sentiment around the trade war shifts, Bitcoin won’t be heavily affected. In fact – like gold – it could strengthen. Upside pressure is brewing.” Source: Swissblock/X Bitcoin is up over 15% this month while the S&P 500 is down about 1.42%. Swissblock also says that the Bitcoin Risk Index is flashing bullish for BTC. The metric aims to evaluate Bitcoin’s current risk environment by aggregating various data points, including on-chain valuation and cost-basis metrics. According to the analytics firm, the metric suggests that Bitcoin’s selling pressure is fading while upside potential is heating up. “Beware bears! Risk-Off Signal at 0 for days: clear evidence that downside pressure is vanishing. We’re in bullish stabilization – pullbacks are now launchpads for more upside.” Source: Swissblock/X Last week, Swissblock said that BTC needs to break its immediate resistance at around $95,000 to trigger new rallies. But the firm also said that BTC may first witness a retracement toward the $89,000 zone to gather bullish momentum before sparking a fresh leg up. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $94,826.

The platform is still investigating how the attack happened, trying to identify the hackers involved and how they can retrieve the stolen funds. They are currently coordinating with law enforcement and security personnel to resolve the situation quickly. In an X post, the platform briefed its users on what it believes to be the main cause of the attack. Loopscale remarked, “The root cause of the exploit has been identified as an isolated issue with Loopscale’s pricing of RateX-based collateral. There is no issue with RateX itself related to this. Loss of funds explicitly affects depositors to SOL and USDC Genesis vaults.” Loopscale allows some functions while restricting others Attackers manipulated the RateX PT token pricing functions, draining 1200 SOL and $5.7 million USDC from the platform’s vaults. Soon after the attack, Loopscale closed off its markets temporarily. However, after a few hours, the protocol reactivated loan repayments, top-ups, and loop closing, while other application functions, like vault withdrawals, remained restricted. The attack mostly affects Loopscale USDC and SOL vault depositors, not necessarily borrowers or loopers on the platform. However, Loopscale has promised to reveal how many users were specifically affected, how holders will withdraw from their vaults, and a technical post-mortem. Before the attack, OShield, which audited the protocol in January and February of this year, identified several vulnerabilities. The project later posted on its FAQ that all high-risk issues had been resolved. Currently, there is still an ongoing audit by Sec3 on the protocol. Loopscale, only launched two years ago, on April 10, introduced a unique order book-based lending model to structure modular loans, providing more predictable terms and minimizing rate volatility. The protocol features fixed-rate, fixed-duration, and multi-asset borrowing, earning the support of major crypto companies like CoinFund, Jump Capital, and Solana Ventures. In 2021, the project, then called Bridgesplit, a proposed NFT yield product, secured about $4.25 million in VC funding from Solana Labs, Coinbase Ventures, and others. The crypto industry has lost billions of dollars to exploits since the start of 2025 A price manipulation on Oracle earlier this month led to the loss of $7 million for KiloEX. The platform is still planning to compensate affected users based on their resume time. The perpetual futures DEX, however, said that only trades that stayed open throughout the platform’s 10-day pause would be eligible for compensation. Moreover, per a Thursday blog post, participants were advised to close positions once KiloEX resumes to receive full value. Aside from the KiloEX attack, Bybit was hacked for $1.46 billion in February. The attack beats all previous record hacks, including Coincheck’s 2018 hack, when they lost $534 million, and Mt. Gox’s 2014 hack, with $470 million drained. North Korea’s Lazarus group is suspected of hacking Bybit after the exchange announced they traced the attack to malicious JavaScript code served from a compromised Safe AWS S3 bucket and claimed the breach originated outside its platform. As of Q1 2025, over $1.6 billion was lost in DeFi attacks. Platforms like zkLend, Ionic Money, Cardex, Four.Meme, Cashverse, BankX, and GoldReserve NFT have seen their funds drained. In February alone, the crypto industry had lost over $1.53 billion in 9 attacks, a 20% surge from January and an 18x increase from February 2024.

Atkins said digital assets have the potential to bring ”tremendous benefits,” including risk mitigation and cost savings. The regulator's change of course The SEC chief's remarks came as part of the third of five roundtables held in recent weeks at the Commission's Washington, D.C. headquarters. The current discussion, titled ”Know Your Custodian: Key Aspects of Holding Cryptoassets,” is part of the work of a special cryptocurrency working group. Atkins officially took office as SEC chairman earlier this week after being nominated by President Trump and subsequently confirmed by the Senate. Prior to his appointment, he founded consulting firm Patomak Global Partners in 2009, whose clients include banks, cryptocurrency exchanges and DeFi platforms. Atkins previously served as SEC commissioner from 2002 to 2008, where he was appointed by President George W. Bush Jr. Criticism of the previous approach The new SEC chairman did not fail to criticize the commission's previous approach to regulating cryptocurrencies under the Biden administration. ”Unfortunately, innovation has been stifled over the past several years due to market and regulatory uncertainty, which the SEC has unfortunately encouraged,” Atkins said. Former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler took a far less friendly approach to the crypto industry, arguing that most cryptocurrencies are securities and bringing charges against major crypto platforms for failing to register with the commission. Since Gensler's departure in January, the SEC has rescinded controversial guidance on cryptocurrency accounting, halted enforcement actions against major crypto industry players, and created a cryptocurrency working group to lead ongoing roundtables. Atkins has previously said that developing a clear regulatory framework for digital assets will be a top priority of his work at the SEC. The regulator's actions in the field of cryptocurrencies already differ significantly from the approach practiced in previous years. The Cryptocurrency Working Group has already held two roundtables, the last of which was devoted to crypto trading. The SEC's change of position has been a turning point for the US cryptocurrency market. The new approach, focused on cooperation and creation of clear rules, can attract more institutional investors and stimulate the development of innovations in this area.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-27 07:18:23

Bet-David, a prominent businessman and financial commentator, shared his insights during an appearance on his popular TV program, Valuetainment, in March. Advantage over SWIFT Bet-David highlighted the advantages XRP holds over the SWIFT network, particularly in terms of speed and cost-effectiveness. While SWIFT processes an estimated $5 trillion in transactions daily, XRP’s native blockchain, the XRP Ledger, can settle transactions in just three to five seconds for a fraction of a cent. This efficiency, Bet-David suggested, positions XRP as a superior alternative to SWIFT, which currently handles a significant portion of global cross-border payments. Bet-David also emphasized the ongoing debate surrounding XRP’s potential to either complement or replace SWIFT altogether . Given XRP’s capabilities, he raised the possibility that the crypto asset could eventually handle a substantial share of the $1.25 quadrillion in annual transactions that SWIFT facilitates. Price Forecasts and Market Implications During his discussion, Bet-David also referenced an optimistic projection for XRP’s value, predicting that the token could reach $100 under certain market conditions. He based this on the scenario where XRP captures just 10% of SWIFT’s annual transaction volume, amounting to $125 trillion. Such a development, he speculated, could push XRP’s market capitalization toward $10 trillion. Bet-David also brought attention to even bolder predictions made by some analysts, suggesting that XRP could rise to as high as $1,000 per token if it were to fully displace SWIFT. While acknowledging that those making these predictions may hold significant amounts of XRP themselves, Bet-David remained confident that such outcomes were plausible if the token were to fulfill its full potential. Barriers to Mass Adoption Despite his optimism, Bet-David noted that XRP’s path to widespread institutional adoption has been hindered by the ongoing legal challenges involving the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This regulatory uncertainty, he argued, has prevented XRP from achieving its full market potential. However, he remains hopeful that a favourable outcome for Ripple in the SEC lawsuit could lead to broader regulatory acceptance and boost investor confidence, particularly within the U.S. Ripple’s Executive Advocacy for XRP’s Role in Global Finance Bet-David’s remarks mirror the sentiments expressed by Ripple executives, who have long championed XRP’s ability to replace traditional financial infrastructure like SWIFT. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, in particular, has repeatedly stressed the inefficiencies of the SWIFT system, highlighting XRP’s superior transaction speed and reliability. He has also pointed out the high error rate of SWIFT transactions (6%) compared to XRP’s low error rate of just 0.1%. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s executives have continued to push for XRP as a better solution for global financial transactions. At the World Economic Forum in Davos this year, Ripple’s Senior Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, Eric van Miltenburg, described Ripple as a modern alternative to SWIFT, citing its faster and more affordable nature. Ripple’s advocacy for XRP as a potential SWIFT replacement has been a key part of the company’s strategy for several years, with earlier statements from Garlinghouse and Ripple Chairman Chris Larsen suggesting that XRP could eventually dominate the global payments space. Patrick Bet-David’s comments have reignited the conversation about XRP’s potential to revolutionize the global financial system. While challenges remain, particularly with regulatory hurdles, the entrepreneur’s predictions about XRP’s price and its ability to rival SWIFT show the growing interest in the crypto asset’s long-term viability. If XRP can achieve the kind of market dominance that Bet-David envisions, the price of the token could see substantial growth, benefiting from the asset’s ability to handle high volumes of transactions faster and more cheaply than traditional systems.

However, while XRP’s momentum builds, a quiet challenger, Mutuum Finance is emerging in the form that could outpace it to the $3.50 milestone. Today’s Phase 4 presale of Mutuum Finance has seen high demand, with over 9,100 investors participating and pushing the total funds raised to $7.2 million. Investors who invest at this point can be assured of a 140% return as MUTM tokens list at $0.06 on launch. With institutional interest growing and a rapidly expanding use case in decentralized finance, this low-cap competitor might surprise investors by achieving explosive growth in a fraction of the time it takes XRP to reach its target. The race is on, and while XRP is a strong performer, this under-the-radar token is quickly becoming the one to watch. XRP’s Bull Flag Could be the Prelude to $3.50, but a $0.025 Coin May Beat it to It Ripple (XRP) has long been investors’ sweetheart as they try to find stability and growth in the crypto market, and its recent bull flag formation is suggesting that it may be gearing up for a dash to $3.50. As the legal case against the SEC comes to a close, XRP’s prospects of reclaiming its former glory improve, driven by its strong use case in cross-border payments and institutional backing. However, even as XRP is regaining traction, a cheap alternative at $0.025 is beginning to create waves, drawing the attention of whales and traders. As much as Ripple’s optimism is inspiring, this new altcoin might be in for an even faster upward trend, with some projections showing that it is able to hit $3.50 first. Mutuum Finance Presale Garners Strong Investor Support Mutuum Finance ‘s Phase 4 presale continues to be in great demand by investors, with over $7.2 million and over 9,100 holders. With its current price at $0.025, the MUTM tokens present a highly rewarding opportunity for early investors who could enjoy a 140% return when the token price hits $0.06 on day one. Specialists put MUTM’s worth at around $3 in market capitalization, and hence, that much more appealing. With Phase 5 introducing the price hike to $0.03, the prospects look good for investors who are entering early in the presale. Mutuum Finance’s live leaderboard also rewards regular participants with bonus tokens for their long-term holding, reinforcing the holding mentality further. Peer-to-Contract (P2C): Smart contracts govern lending pools and adjust interest rates based on the market, offering stability to lenders and ensuring loans to borrowers. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): The decentralized method dispenses with middlemen and allows for direct connections between borrowers and lenders, offering both parties total autonomy. The platform is focused on security and transparency using open-source smart contracts and third-party audits. The MUTM token also provides long-term value through price appreciation and passive earnings, backed by a buyback mechanism. Support for multi-chains, including EVM and non-EVM blockchains, will also further increase liquidity and accessibility. $100,000 Giveaway and Community Incentives to Foster Growth Mutuum Finance is also creating its community through a $100,000 giveaway. Ten users will win $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The platform’s referral system also incentivizes users to bring new joiners to the ecosystem, creating organic growth. Early adopters are also rewarded with exclusive rewards such as special staking, governance voting, and early updates, keeping them committed to the project development. XRP aims for $3.50, but MUTM at $0.025 may beat it there. With $7.2M raised and 140% ROI expected at launch, it’s gaining fast. Strong DeFi utility, cross-chain support, and a $100K giveaway make it a top pick.

However, when asked why more celebrities aren’t Bitcoiners, he says most people simply refuse to ever sit down and study again. “It is really hard to get people to study after they graduate, from any level,” Miller told Natalie Brunell on the April 23 episode of Coin Stories. Miller claimed it takes “about 50 hours of study” to understand Bitcoin ( BTC ). Hollywood rewards those who “do not think differently” “So to say to somebody it is going to take 50 hours for you to understand this, they are like, ah, I don’t want to,” he said. “They can’t even watch a Netflix series; they can’t even watch White Lotus because it takes seven hours,” he said. Comedian and actor TJ Miller spoke to Bitcoiner Natalie Brunell on the Coin Stories podcast. Source: Natalie Brunell Miller said it takes “such a paradigm shift” to embrace Bitcoin, not just in money or the internet, but in life — and that’s also why you don’t see more Hollywood celebrities becoming Bitcoin maxis: “Hollywood rewards people that do not think differently.” During a Bitcoin lunch hosted by crypto entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano, Miller introduced himself that, to his knowledge, he is “the only celebrity that is a Bitcoiner.” “I can’t really think of anyone else,” Miller said. While there aren't many celebrities known to be publicly active in the Bitcoin community, many have launched their own memecoins in recent years, including Iggy Azalea , Caitlyn Jenner, and Hailey Welch aka “Hawk Tuah.” However, Miller said he has been trying to educate people on Bitcoin for quite some time. He said when Bitcoin was trading between $8,000 and $12,000, he was telling friends to “just put $1,000 into Bitcoin.” Miller is confident that, at some point in the future, there will be a Hollywood movie about the Bitcoin revolution.

Cointelegraph’s Gareth Jenkinson recently sat down with TJ Miller, where it became evident that his enthusiasm for Bitcoin isn’t just surface-level . He wants to use his platform to educate and inspire others to take it seriously. “You can tell that I’m passionate about it.

It augments output and enhances computational capabilities but also disseminates misinformation and manipulates public discourse, as the rise of deepfakes has convincingly demonstrated. AI systems face systemic challenges, with some models exhibiting comparatively high error rates, reflecting poorly on the whole industry, and undermining public trust. The consequences of AI's limitations can be dire in self-driving vehicles, healthcare, and high-stakes industries in general. Minor visual alterations can cause autonomous vehicles to make disastrous mistakes, and small data errors can lead to misdiagnoses or overlooked risks. Verifiable AI is becoming a palpable trend as public awareness of the downsides of black-box AI grows. Beyond a buzzword, it refers to the development of accountable, auditable, and transparent AI systems. It ensures AI models and their decisions can be clarified and verified so direct users and stakeholders can trust them. It also allows organizations to trace AI systems' decision-making processes, validate the algorithms and data used, and confirm that they are operating without error or bias. In contrast, the concept of black-box AI denotes systems whose internal decision-making processes are not easily accessible or understood. The systems' output, which they arrive at through complicated computations, is untraceable because there is no insight into the underlying processes. Users receive a decision or output without a clear understanding of how the AI reached that conclusion. Joining forces in the name of trust Blockchain technology has emerged as a powerful ally to AI platforms attempting to achieve transparent decision-making. Kite AI and EigenLayer recently announced a partnership aimed at reinforcing trust and security within the framework of decentralized AI, which involves integrating EigenLayer's restaking technology into Kite AI's blockchain-based AI asset marketplace. The collaboration prioritizes scalable security and trustless verification of AI computations, resulting in an environment where AI data, models, and agents can achieve guaranteed performance and integrity backed by Ethereum's proven security mechanisms. Kite AI is an EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain, running a marketplace where people can buy, sell, or use AI tools and models. EigenLayer (""own layer"") supplements it by allowing anyone to build on top of a decentralized trust network. Its restaking system helps strengthen security by using Ethereum's trusted setup in a new way. Together, they're making sure that AI models' results can be verified and trusted without needing a middleman and that the system is scalable, meaning it can grow and handle more activity. Kite AI validates AI assets and output in a decentralized manner using EigenLayer's Autonomous Verifiable Service (AVS) framework. Specifically, EigenLayer's validators perform specialized verification tasks to confirm the accuracy of AI model outputs and that listed AI assets fulfill concrete criteria. This means Kite AI's users and developers receive additional assurance, as each AI asset or result is independently verified by a distributed staked validator network instead of relying on the asset provider's claims. Accountability in the age of hallucinating machines This partnership blurs the lines between AI and blockchain, helping mitigate the significant risks associated with AI. Humans once considered the idea of open-source tools generating convincing text, images, audio, and videos at the speed of light a panacea. However, AI's prevalence has sprung considerable concerns about validity and authenticity, and the implications of black-box tools' propensity to ""hallucinate"" can be severe, particularly for organizations trying to stand out in cutthroat markets. In the simplest of terms, ChatGPT, Claude, Bard, Perplexity, and others can make things up. The tools can generate content that is not rooted in facts but in speculation. They ignore context and factual accuracy in their effort to satisfy the user's request or prompt as quickly and as closely as possible. The issue of who takes responsibility for the outcome is even more disconcerting. Current legal frameworks don't typically hold the creators of modern LLMs criminally responsible for actions taken by the direct users of the tools. There's nothing stopping them from blaming the users or the tools themselves for their faulty outputs. Despite AI's prevalence, the tools are considered experimental, i.e., they're still ""learning."" At the end of the day, the person who uses them takes responsibility for any consequences of acting on their output. They are held accountable for failing to understand their limitations. Reducing the risk of AI-generated harm AI systems rely on data for training and operation, so data providers should be held accountable for the data's accuracy and quality. They should ensure it respects privacy regulations and is ethically sourced. Decentralized data sources and verification tools lower the risk of false or biased data because they enable insight into decision-making and output. They can help address the absence of proper safeguards and thoughtful implementation and play a crucial role in combating false information, which is easily perpetuated, given how convincingly it's presented. There's otherwise no way to mitigate risks arising from the fact that AI models are trained on aggregated data, act on prompts, and lack the intuition to determine whether the data or prompts (or both) are biased, harmful, or ignorant of the evidence. Integrations of blockchain and AI emerge as the last and sometimes only line of defense. Consider a real-world example: an AI system makes a decision that negatively impacts a business, and the business suffers from relying on it without question. Whether the AI vendor or developer will take responsibility for an error resulting from a system flaw is questionable. The responsibility will likely be borne by the employee who used the tool without understanding how it works and potentially by their manager for failing to supervise them. It might all end with the employee being fired, but a huge error will affect the entire organization. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

She pointed out that the contracts will be “financially settled in USD,” meaning there will be no actual handling, movement, or delivery of XRP upon expiration. Instead, all settlements will occur in U.S. dollars. ""Financially settled contracts in USD"" means XRP is not handled, moved or delivered upon expiration. https://t.co/lvyIsTb4rL pic.twitter.com/g92rcFP1OE — Crypto Eri ~ Carpe Diem (@sentosumosaba) April 24, 2025 In response to a comment criticizing her outlook as negative, Crypto Eri explained her position, stating, “Using the asset matters.” She emphasized that real utility and direct interaction with XRP are critical for influencing its market fundamentals. The Importance Of Using XRP Another community member noted that financially settled contracts still track the price of XRP and can influence sentiment, hedging strategies, and even spot market flows. He argued that while no XRP changes hands, exposure to price movements alone can matter. Crypto Eri countered this stance, arguing that the price tracking relies on a centralized oracle service. She said the underlying asset “could be kangaroo meat,” illustrating her view that such arrangements reduce the contract’s meaningful connection to XRP itself. She maintained that to genuinely impact XRP’s market value, transactions must involve the asset. Crypto Eri further elaborated that these types of financial products resemble prediction markets. Many experts believe nothing else matches XRP’s utility . However, for the asset to experience substantial growth, there must be a direct influence on its supply and demand through purchases and settlements involving it. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Community Reception and Broader Implications Not everyone agreed with Crypto Eri’s critical view. Some commenters suggested that her posts might discourage optimism about XRP’s future. One user mentioned that such comments contribute to perceptions that she has become a “buzz kill” within the community. Crypto Eri reiterated that positive price action must be driven by genuine utility rather than speculative financial instruments. She explained that while price forecasts and speculative trading have long been features of the digital asset space, they do not create the kind of sustained demand necessary to alter the price in the long term. In her view, the real driver of value in cryptocurrencies should be tangible use cases that increase the need for the asset itself, not simply bets on future price movements. A well-known crypto CEO recently highlighted institutional adoption as a crucial factor that could aid XRP’s growth, and utility is important for institutions looking at it. While CME Group’s decision to introduce XRP futures has been welcomed by many as a sign of growing institutional interest, not using the digital asset could lower its positive impact on the asset’s price.

Speaking at a town hall in Georgia on April 25, Ossoff criticized the president for what he described as “selling access” to his office. “I saw just 48 hours ago, he is granting audiences to people who buy his meme coin,” Ossoff said, according to NBC News . “When the sitting president of the United States is effectively accepting payments for access, that clearly qualifies as an impeachable offense.” Senator Backs Trump Impeachment but Says Action Unlikely Without Democrat Majority While Ossoff emphasized his firm backing for impeachment proceedings, he acknowledged that any such action would face significant hurdles unless Democrats regain control of Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Currently, Republicans hold the majority in both chambers. The controversy stems from an April 23 announcement on the Official Trump memecoin website, which revealed plans for an exclusive dinner hosted by President Trump at his Washington, D.C. golf club. The event is reserved for the top 220 TRUMP token holders, with the website posting a public leaderboard and registration details. Following the announcement, the TRUMP token surged over 50%, according to CoinMarketCap. WATCH: Woman yells about Trump: ""We need him impeached! We need him removed!"" Sen.

Additionally, no guests are permitted. $TRUMP Token Team Denies $300K Requirement for Dinner with President In a statement posted on April 24, the $TRUMP token team clarified that holders do not need to spend $300,000 to qualify for its “Dinner with President Trump” contest. The team said that entry includes exchange and locked holdings not participating in the contest. Eligibility is determined solely by registered users on the official leaderboard, which ranks time-weighted $TRUMP balances throughout the competition. “People have been incorrectly quoting #220 on the block explorer as the cutoff. That’s wrong because it includes things like locked tokens, exchanges, market makers, and those who are not participating,” the team said. The project emphasized that all participants must register to be counted. As of the announcement, the 220th-ranked participant held just over $400 worth of tokens. The leaderboard is available at trumpdinner.gettrumpmemes.com. Tokens from the cliff unlock and daily distributions will remain locked for an additional 90 days, the team said, extending past the competition period.

By turning physical assets into digital tokens, blockchain enables secure, fractional ownership and trading, which can cut operational inefficiencies, lower administrative costs, and boost retail investor participation. Over the past eight years, tokenization has opened up new paths for real estate investment, and this momentum is growing fast. Deloitte projects that by 2035, $4 trillion of real estate could be tokenized , soaring from less than $0.3 trillion in 2024 with an impressive 27% compound annual growth rate. The tokenized real estate market will likely be driven by three key segments: Tokenized loans and securitizations are expected to dominate, reaching $2.39 trillion by 2035. Private real estate funds could grow to $1 trillion, capturing 8.5% market share. Ownership of undeveloped land and projects may reach $50 billion. Blockchain platforms could streamline real estate funds by simplifying issuance, servicing, and secondary market trading, all while reducing reliance on intermediaries. Two models are emerging: ""off-chain"" funds using debt tokens backed by loan pools, and fully ""on-chain"" real estate trust deeds. A real-world example is Kin Capital's planned $100 million real estate debt fund on Chintai's blockchain. Tokenization allows investors to build hyper-personalized portfolios, targeting assets based on sustainability, location, or other custom preferences. However, managing defaults will be critical—early players must develop mechanisms where lenders can access real-world assets tied to tokens if needed. Beyond property, securitized loans are gaining traction. Despite skepticism after the 2008 crisis, blockchain-backed securities offer faster reporting, better transparency, and lower costs. For instance, LiquidFi slashed mortgage-backed securities reporting from 55 days to just 30 minutes using Stellar blockchain. Tokenization also unlocks dynamic financing for projects like residential developments and data centers. Major deals, like T-RIZE Group's $300 million tokenization of a Canadian housing project, show its potential. As more blockchains emerge, interoperability will be crucial. Future systems must allow tokens to move seamlessly between platforms while preserving privacy and meeting regulations. Advances like layer-2 solutions and new regulatory frameworks are paving the way for broader adoption. For real estate managers and investors looking to engage, several factors are key: choosing the right blockchain, ensuring secure custody solutions, understanding tax implications, and reinforcing cybersecurity defenses.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-04-27 08:57:11

This week, Brazilian bank Itaú made the headlines by announcing its new $210 million investment in Bitcoin. On the other hand, Argentina’s CNV presented its new tokenisation regime. Itaú to invest $210 million in Bitcoin Itaú Bank announced an initial investment of 210 million dollars to establish Oranje, a company focused on accumulating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve. This new initiative follows the model of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), a company founded by Michael Saylor, the world’s largest Bitcoin holder. Guilherme Gomes, the previous CEO of Swan Bitcoin, will lead the business, with Guilherme Ferreira from Bahema serving as CFO. According to Beincrypto, the governing structure includes prominent crypto figures such as Eric Weiss and Fernando Ulrich. Oranje intends to use fundraising tactics such as debt issuance and stock sales, following the example of companies like Strategy. The firm also provides tax and operational benefits to clients wanting direct Bitcoin exposure without intermediaries. Oranje, formed by Banco Itaú, is betting on Bitcoin’s rise as a strategic reserve asset, citing its global adoption of only 3% despite being the world’s fifth-largest asset, valued at $2 trillion. The company sees recent legislative changes, notably those following Donald Trump’s election in the United States, as beneficial to the cryptocurrency industry. Oranje is following Strategy’s method, which has already been adopted by a number of companies around the world. Oranje, backed by partners including Itaú BBA, Pinheiro Neto Advogados, Pillsbury, and one of the Big Four auditing firms, believes the “Bitcoin Standard” is altering corporate treasury strategies. They see this trend as a one-of-a-kind market opportunity that has the potential to transform how firms manage their reserves. Argentina proposes a tokenisation framework Argentina’s National Securities Commission (CNV) has presented a new regulatory proposal on tokenisation to members of the capital market and virtual asset industries. According to Cointelegraph , the draft rule, which was recently authorised under RG No. 1060, establishes a framework for the digital depiction of marketable securities through the use of distributed ledger technologies. CNV President Dr. Roberto Silva noted the proposal’s unique nature, which is now open for public comment for 15 days. The policy attempts to equate tokenised assets with traditional securities while also improving security, traceability, and transparency. It enables the tokenisation of a diverse set of assets, including stocks, bonds, investment fund units, and CEDEARS. CNV authorities detailed the technical scope of the rule with the cooperation of significant business associations and legal firms, establishing Argentina as a regional leader in digital asset regulation. Panama City embraces crypto for tax payments Panama City Mayor Mayer Mizrachi and Towerbank President Benjamín Méndez struck an agreement at Panama Blockchain Week 2025 to allow citizens to pay municipal taxes with cryptocurrency. The program, undertaken by Towerbank’s fiduciary subsidiary Towertrust, ensures that all cryptocurrency payments are translated into US dollars before they reach the city’s accounts. This approach enables the municipality to benefit from innovation without directly handling digital assets, while retaining compliance and transparency.

Right now, while the big names like Bitcoin , Solana , and XRP continue to strengthen, a powerful new player is making its move: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . Serious traders know the signs—rising wallet activity, surging engagement, and expanding mentions across high-value networks. And today, they’re spotting something they haven’t seen in a while: a fresh opportunity still in its prime discovery phase. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Building Momentum the Right Way In crypto, anyone can generate attention for a week—but few projects build staying power. MAGACOINFINANCE is doing exactly that by focusing on real execution, organic community growth, and transparent rollout phases. The project’s growth isn’t about hype—it’s about foundations. Developers are communicating regularly. Community engagement is picking up steam.

It’s about entering before the rush—and the clock is ticking. Why XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin Are Still at the Top XRP has completed its regulatory transformation and is now operating with full clarity in critical global markets. Its real-world use case for payment settlements keeps strengthening its long-term value proposition. Solana continues to dominate the conversation around speed and cost-efficiency. Its NFT resurgence, dApp ecosystem expansion, and lightning-fast settlement layer make it essential for developers who need scale without compromise. Bitcoin remains the king of digital assets. Its macro narrative has only grown stronger, with institutions building bigger positions and Bitcoin ETFs bringing in waves of new capital. But for investors seeking asymmetric early-stage upside?

Polkadot remains a leader in multi-chain solutions. Its parachain innovations are fostering an ecosystem where specialized chains can thrive independently and still connect seamlessly. Each of these projects is critical—but MAGACOINFINANCE still holds the advantage of being at the beginning of its lifecycle, where growth potential is widest. Final Word A 60,000% move might seem outrageous—but in crypto, it’s the early signals that determine whether you’re chasing or leading.

Ossoff criticized Trump's move as a “direct interaction sell” and called it an “impeachable offense.” “When a sitting president of the United States is selling an interaction in exchange for payments made directly to him, there is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense,” Ossoff said, addressing a visibly angry crowd in a video shared by Georgia political reporter Greg Bluestein. The House of Representatives has the power to impeach a federal official, including the president, for treason, bribery, or “other high crimes and misdemeanors.” If impeached, the president would face trial in the Senate, where a two-thirds majority is required for removal. Related News: Bitcoin-Friendly Senator Warns Against the FED's Trap for Cryptocurrencies Trump, who was impeached twice in his first term and acquitted by the Senate both times, has positioned himself as a defender of the crypto industry during his current presidency. But Trump’s personal involvement in cryptocurrency ventures has also raised ethical concerns. Businesses linked to Trump and his family include stablecoin issuer World Liberty Financial, bitcoin mining ventures, crypto-based ETFs and memecoins named after both the president and the first lady. The latest controversy centers around the TRUMP memecoin, which announced Wednesday that its top 220 investors will be invited to a gala dinner with the president at his Virginia golf club on May 22. Those in the top 25 will also receive VIP treatment, including a reception with Trump and a tour of the White House. Since the announcement, the value of the TRUMP token has increased by more than 40%. Trump and his close associates are estimated to own 80% of the token supply, which is currently worth around $10.8 billion. *This is not investment advice.

In a new video update on Fundstrat’s YouTube channel, Lee starts off by noting that on April 24th, a Zweig breadth thrust was triggered on the S&P 500 index. The Zweig breadth thrust is an indicator that attempts to detect the early stages of a potential bull run by dividing the 10-day moving average of the number of advancing stocks by the total number of stocks. Lee says that the Zweig breadth thrust has nearly always signaled imminent stock market rallies. “That has happened 11 times since 1978 and notably, one month, six months and 12 months later, stock markets are always up. And this was triggered on April 24.” Secondly, Lee notes that the high yield options adjusted spreads (OaS) retraced 50% of its widening on April 23rd. A shrinking of credit spreads – the difference in yield between riskier junk bonds and “risk-free” government bonds – typically signals stability and healthy investor risk appetite. “That’s a positive development because we are now walking back from a recession risk. If high yield spreads had gone from 500 [basis points] to 1,000, a recession was guaranteed, but instead it’s reversed almost all the widening back to even levels before April 2nd.” Lee also says that the S&P 500 saw two straight days where 90% of the S&P 500 stocks rallied, an event that has historically led to further upside. “That means that stocks, within a couple of days apart, had posted two days where the advancing gains were 90% or more. As you can see here, three times since 1979, stocks are higher three, six and 12 months later.” Source: Fundstrat Lastly, the investor takes note of the volatility index (VIX) – a measure of market volatility based on data from the Chicago Board Options Exchange – closing below the 31 level. According to Lee, the VIX is now signaling a drop off in future volatility and likely strength for equities.

Meanwhile, XRP is reawakening, backed by legal clarity, fresh institutional partnerships, and a technical setup that could drive it well beyond previous highs. Yet, the real wildcard, Mutuum Finance in this rally may be a new altcoin quietly stacking volume and whale support. The project has already attracted over 9100 investors, raising more than $7.2 million, and is offering incentives such as a $100,000 token giveaway to further boost community engagement. As ADA approaches its cap, XRP and this emerging token seem to be just getting started. The Mutuum Finance team has unveiled a new dashboard with a leaderboard that ranks the top 50 holders, who will be rewarded with bonus tokens for staying in the top 50 positions. Mutuum Finance Presale Takes Off The decentralized finance (DeFi) market adopts Mutuum Finance because of its innovative crypto lending approach which has gained fast momentum. More than 9100 investors have participated in the project’s unique approach through which they poured $7.2 million of capital. Phase 4 features a $0.025 token price with a brief entry period that ends when prices rise 20% because it marks the termination of early investment possibilities. Investors participating in the presale phase can get an enormous 140% ROI by purchasing the token at $0.06. The decentralized finance sector keeps expanding while Mutuum Finance emerges as the leading pioneer which brings innovative lending strategies and solid market leadership. Mutuum Finance utilizes CertiK to conduct an audit of their platform security which will receive publication on their social media channels afterwards. CertiK will audit the platform after completion before the official report gets published on their social media platforms for public transparency and trust. Shaking Up Crypto Lending through a Dual-Model Approach Mutuum Finance is redefining crypto lending by interweaving two dominant models: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The P2C model allows users to contribute stablecoins to liquidity pools managed by smart contracts, earning passive income with instant borrowing availability for platform players. Even interest rates are adjusted automatically by the smart contracts to maximize lenders’ returns and lower borrowing costs. The P2P model takes decentralization to the level of eliminating third parties, allowing borrowers and lenders to directly interact. This provides users with the option to negotiate individualized loan agreements, facilitating higher transparency and an intuitive borrowing experience. Through the Ethereum blockchain the platform stablecoin reaches price stability by using reserve-backed USD. The configuration works as a risk management system for algorithmic stablecoins to secure safe and reliable financial transactions. Mutuum Finance constructs the foundation of future decentralized finance by uniting emerging lending schemes with a solid infrastructure. The MUTM Giveaway As part of its community-building initiative, Mutuum Finance is running an engaging giveaway campaign, offering away $100,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Ten lucky users will receive $10,000 worth of tokens each. The new referral program for the platform also compensates users who bring in new investors. Users also receive access to exclusive staking pools, governance rights, and platform updates, encouraging long-term devotion and loyalty to the platform. While Cardano (ADA) might cap its bull cycle around $5 and XRP gains renewed traction, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly positioning itself as the breakout altcoin of 2025. With over $7.2 million raised, more than 9,100 investors onboard, and a presale price still holding at just $0.025, the window for early, high-upside entry is closing fast. As legacy tokens approach their ceilings, this new DeFi disruptor may offer the best room to run. Secure your position in Mutuum Finance now, before the rest of the market catches on.

Without flashy marketing or meme-fueled communities, Lightchain AI is letting its technology speak for itself. The project’s powerful presale momentum , which has already crossed $19.5 million, signals a growing base of serious investors focused on long-term potential. What makes Lightchain AI stand out is its real-world utility, efficient scalability, and its ability to support AI-optimized workflows within decentralized ecosystems. As larger tokens stagnate or struggle for attention, Lightchain AI continues to gain traction organically. Its quiet rise is proving that genuine innovation and a committed roadmap can outperform hype—especially in a DeFi landscape increasingly starved for trustworthy, high-performance solutions. In this article, we'll take a closer look at Lightchain AI and its potential impact on the world of decentralized finance. Could This Under-the-Radar Crypto Be the Next Big Thing in DeFi? While most DeFi tokens rely on aggressive marketing or meme culture to gain traction, Lightchain AI is carving a different path—one grounded in functionality, not flash. Built to handle high-volume transactions while integrating decentralized AI protocols, Lightchain AI’s infrastructure supports scalable automation across financial workflows. Investors seeking substance over spectacle are beginning to notice, especially with the presale surpassing $19.5 million. Its network efficiency, near-linear scalability, and developer-friendly APIs are attracting attention from those who understand what sustainable DeFi really requires. As token speculation loses its shine, this under-the-radar project could become a core part of decentralized finance in 2025 and beyond, offering tools that streamline operations and reduce congestion while quietly gaining long-term trust in the space. What Makes This Low-Profile Token a Rising Star in Decentralized Finance? Unlike many tokens that depend on influencer hype or short-lived market surges, Lightchain AI’s rise is fueled by robust on-chain architecture. Its Proof of Intelligence mechanism authenticates AI-driven computations while maintaining a seamless workflow across its decentralized network. Developers and early adopters are drawn to the token’s speed, gas optimization capabilities, and cross-chain flexibility, especially as DeFi protocols demand more from their foundational tech. The project’s focus on actual utility has already secured it over $19.5 million in presale contributions, indicating institutional-level interest. With a rising emphasis on AI integration within DeFi systems, Lightchain AI's quiet but steady positioning could transform it from an overlooked gem to a cornerstone of the space—without needing to ride hype-driven waves. Is This Quiet Contender Set to Disrupt the DeFi Landscape in 2025? Lightchain AI is not just keeping pace with emerging trends—it’s setting new standards. As 2025 approaches, DeFi is shifting toward intelligent automation, lower transaction friction, and multi-chain interoperability. Lightchain AI is delivering on all fronts with its AI Virtual Machine (AIVM), designed to execute AI-enhanced contracts across decentralized applications. This places it far ahead of most low-cap tokens that lack real infrastructure. Its presale, already hitting $19.5 million, reflects growing confidence in its capacity to scale and innovate. While others clamor for visibility, Lightchain AI is quietly building the tools that the next generation of DeFi will run on. This low-profile yet high-impact strategy may soon position it as one of the top disruptors in the decentralized finance ecosystem.

However, bullish momentum seems to have stalled in the past day amidst a minor retracement and an ongoing price consolidation. Notably, speculations over Bitcoin’s ability to sustain the current uptrend also persist. Interestingly, popular crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci has shed some light on possible developments that could decide BTC’s price movement in the immediate future. Related Reading: Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Remains In Positive Zone — What This Means For Price Bitcoin MVRV Faces Resistance At 365 SMA In an X post on Saturday, Kesmeci reports that the Bitcoin MVRV is now facing an important resistance at its 365-day simple moving average (365SMA). The analyst explains that potential developments from this situation are influential to Bitcoin’s mid-term future. The Bitcoin MVRV ratio (Market Value to Realized Value) is an important on-chain metric that measures whether Bitcoin trading price is relatively overvalued or undervalued compared to its realized price. Technically, the MVRV is used to indicate profitability, but this metric can also signal market stages, such as a price top/bottom, or identify the current price trend. Meanwhile, the MVRV 365SMA, which produces an average of all MVRV ratios over the past 365 days, represents a critical threshold for medium-term reversal. Typically, when the MVRV remains below the 365SMA, it signals a bearish market, while a crossover above the 365SMA is interpreted as a bullish confirmation. Following recent market developments, Bitcoin’s MVRV currently stands at 2.13, just slightly below its 365SMA at 2.14. To confirm a long-term bullish market despite recent gains, an upward crossover between the MVRV and its 365SMA must occur, signaling a potential medium-term trend reversal following the prolonged correction phase in early 2025. Related Reading: Ethereum Flips Key Resistance Into Support – Can Bulls Reclaim $2,000 Level? Bitcoin Network Fees Climb By 42% In other developments, on-chain analytics firm IntoTheBlock reports that Bitcoin network fees surged by 42% in the past week. During this time, traders spent $4.03 million on transaction fees, suggesting a high level of network engagement. Meanwhile, crypto exchanges also recorded net withdrawals valued at $356 million. While this figure falls far lower from the $1.3 billion reported in the previous week, it indicates that many investors are still opting to keep their assets. Both the increase in network activity and sustained exchange outflows point to strong underlying demand and positive sentiment in the Bitcoin market. At the time of writing, Bitcoin continues to trade at $94,233 after a 0.78% decline in the past day. On larger timeframes, the premier cryptocurrency remains in profit with gains of 11.27% and 8.59% in the last seven and 30 days, respectively.

BlackRock’s IBIT ETF led the charge, absorbing over $240 million in a single day, followed by Fidelity with a $108 million addition. Cumulative flows into Bitcoin ETFs now exceed $41.2 billion, signaling a renewed wave of institutional confidence. BREAKING BLACKROCK JUST BOUGHT $240 MILLION WORTH OF BITCOIN pic.twitter.com/HH4URkxSDF — DustyBC Crypto (@TheDustyBC) April 26, 2025 This aggressive buying spree coincided with Bitcoin’s jump from $85,000 to near $94,250, igniting fresh forecasts of a breakout past the $100,000 mark. ETF-driven momentum combined with reduced miner selling is creating a supply squeeze, historically a catalyst for strong price action. Key Drivers Behind the Rally: BlackRock IBIT ETF inflows: $240M in one day Fidelity ETF inflows: $108M Cumulative ETF flows: $41.2B+ Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas summed it up: “It’s a Bitcoin bender out there,” highlighting the sudden and intense shift in ETF sentiment. Institutional Appetite Grows Amid Market Shifts Beyond Bitcoin, BlackRock’s expanding digital asset strategy further reflects this shift. On April 24, BlackRock confirmed $240 million in Bitcoin purchases alongside $54 million in Ethereum acquisitions. CEO Larry Fink, once a crypto skeptic, now labels Bitcoin “digital gold” and sees Ethereum as the backbone for tokenized finance. BREAKING: BLACKROCK JUST BOUGHT $240,000,000 WORTH OF BITCOIN HERE WE GOOO pic.twitter.com/dwpShxGdFf — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) April 26, 2025 Following the announcement, Ethereum surged 5.2% to $3,850, with trading volume jumping 120% in just an hour. This sharp move underscores the growing role of institutional players in driving crypto market trends. Key Institutional Moves: BlackRock Bitcoin purchase: $240M BlackRock Ethereum purchase: $54M Ethereum volume spike: +120% in 1 hour With clearer regulatory frameworks emerging, analysts expect institutional interest to intensify, boosting the maturing digital asset landscape. Bitcoin Price Outlook: Final Hurdle Before $100K? On the technical front, Bitcoin is nearing a critical resistance at $95,380, where a long-term descending trendline meets horizontal supply. The 50-day EMA ($87,270) remains intact as strong dynamic support, but the MACD indicator is starting to plateau—warning that momentum could pause if $95,380 isn’t decisively broken. Trade Plan: Buy breakout: Above $95,380 Upside targets: $99,620 and $104,820 Stop-loss: Below $88,620 For new traders, this is a textbook “make-or-break” setup. A clean daily close above $95,380 could catapult Bitcoin toward new all-time highs. However, a rejection here could trigger a healthy correction toward the $88,620 support zone. Patience will be crucial: real price discovery mode may only begin after breaching $95,380 with strong volume confirmation. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5M Milestone as 81% Yield Boosts Staking Demand Investor momentum behind BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) remains strong, with the Ethereum-based project officially surpassing the $5 million mark in its ongoing presale. As of today, $5.05 million has been raised out of a $5.74 million target, signaling rising urgency among buyers as the next price jump approaches. The current token price stands at $0.00248, offering a limited window before another repricing. High-Yield Staking with Flexible Access BTCBULL continues to set itself apart from typical meme assets by focusing on sustainable utility. The project’s staking program offers an estimated 81% annual yield, complemented by Bitcoin-backed distribution rewards. Crucially, users retain full liquidity with the ability to unstake anytime—no mandatory lockup periods or penalties. Latest Staking Snapshot: Total Tokens Staked: 1,293,025,857 BTCBULL Estimated Annual Yield: 81% APY Unstaking: Available at any time This flexible structure appeals to both yield hunters and investors seeking upside potential without giving up liquidity. Presale Snapshot: Final Stretch Before Repricing With less than $683,000 left before the next price adjustment, BTCBULL’s presale is rapidly entering its final stages at the current rate. Investors are securing positions before the project’s valuation steps higher. Presale Metrics (Updated): Token Price: $0.00248 USDT Raised: $5,058,002.58 out of $5,741,234 target BTCBULL combines an aggressive yield model with meme-token upside, carving out a niche for investors looking for more than just speculative trading. As the remaining funding gap narrows, the next price increase could arrive imminently—rewarding early movers in the process.

Institutions and governments worldwide are starting to recognize the unique monetary properties of Bitcoin ( BTC ), according to Adam Back, co-founder and CEO of Blockstream and the inventor of Hashcash. “$MSTR and other treasury companies are an arbitrage of the dislocation between the bitcoin future and todays fiat world,” Back wrote in an April 26 X post. “A sustainable and scalable $100-$200 trillion trade front-running hyperbitcoinization. scalable enough for most big listed companies to move to btc treasury,” he added. Hyperbitcoinization refers to the theoretical future where Bitcoin soars to become the largest global currency, replacing fiat money due to its inflationary economics and growing distrust in the legacy financial system. Source: Adam Back Related: Crypto sentiment recovers, but weekend liquidity risks remain Bitcoin’s price outpacing fiat money inflation remains the main driver of global hyperbitcoinization, Back said, adding: “Some people think treasury strategy is a temporary glitch. i’m saying no it's a logical and sustainable arbitrage. but not for ever, the driver is bitcoin price going up over 4 year periods faster than interest and inflation.” Back’s comments come nearly two months after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a national Bitcoin reserve from BTC forfeited in government criminal cases. Related: Serbia’s Prince Filip says Bitcoin is being stifled, expects huge rally Global firms continue Bitcoin accumulation Continued Bitcoin investments from the likes of Strategy, the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, may inspire more global firms to follow suit.

Source: Michael Saylor Japanese investment firm Metaplanet , also known as “Asia’s MicroStrategy,” adopted a similar strategy, since surpassing 5,000 BTC in total holdings on April 24, Cointelegraph reported. As Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder, Metaplanet plans to acquire 21,000 BTC by 2026. US financial institutions may also have more confidence in adopting Bitcoin after the US Federal Reserve withdrew its 2022 guidance discouraging banks from engaging with cryptocurrency. “Banks are now free to begin supporting Bitcoin,” Saylor said in response to the guidance withdrawal. “Banks will now be supervised through normal processes, signaling a more open regulatory environment for digital asset integration,” Nexo dispatch analyst Iliya Kalchev told Cointelegraph.

Maybe it was Ethereum when it was still under $50 or Injective before it even cracked $1. That moment where you scroll through old charts thinking, “Man, this could’ve been it.” That feeling? It’s real—and in 2025, it’s happening all over again with some new players stepping into the spotlight. Ethereum and Injective are showing strong signs in recent upgrades and real-world traction, but a new project, Qubetics, might just be the one still flying under the radar—with serious potential in both tech and returns. Qubetics ($TICS) isn’t just another name on the watchlist. It’s solving problems most major blockchains are still struggling with—stuff like interoperability, data silos, and cross-chain user headaches. And it’s not hype-driven; it’s feature-packed. While Ethereum and Injective are making headlines, Qubetics is quietly building something game-changing and still in presale. This might be the first time in a long time where something this ambitious is also this accessible. For those looking for the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term, this presale might be the kind of opportunity most people only recognize after the ship’s already sailed. Right now, though? It’s still docked—and open. One of the top crypto presale projects this season might just be this one. Qubetics Isn’t Just Hype—It’s Solving What Others Couldn’t The reason Qubetics is catching major attention right now? It’s the world’s first Web3-aggregated blockchain that connects major chains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Solana into one unified structure. If that sounds like a big deal—it is. Right now, users and businesses are stuck juggling multiple wallets, clunky apps, and tons of protocols that don’t communicate. Qubetics flips that entire mess into a smooth experience with seamless asset transfers, shared data flows, and real cross-chain usability. Picture a logistics company needing real-time payment data on Ethereum while tracking smart contracts built on Solana. Normally, that’s a tech headache. With Qubetics, they can manage everything under one interface—without switching chains or dealing with conversion fees. For retail users, it simplifies how apps and wallets function. Say goodbye to managing three different extensions and hoping your assets don’t get lost in translation. For developers, Qubetics is basically a dream tool. Instead of building for just one ecosystem, they get access to a multichain toolbox that actually works together. That’s huge for scaling projects, reaching more users, and creating true cross-platform dApps. This kind of flexibility is why people are calling Qubetics one of the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term—because it’s not just another token. It’s foundational tech that lets Web3 finally talk to itself. Why Qubetics Presale Might Be One of the Best Cryptos to Buy and Hold for Short Term While many coins rally after listings, Qubetics is letting early participants get in before the hype with a fully structured presale. It’s currently in its 31st stage, priced at $0.1902, and every stage lasts exactly 7 days, ending on Sunday at 12 a.m. sharp. After every stage, the price climbs by 10%, which means the clock’s ticking every single week. So far, over $16.4 million has already been raised, with more than 25,200 token holders and 509 million $TICS sold—and counting. Now here’s where things get spicy for those looking for real short-term gains. If $TICS reaches $1, that’s a 425.53% ROI. A $200 investment today would turn into $1,051.06. But wait—if $TICS hits $5 post-launch, that same $200 turns into $5,055.42. At $10? It’s $10,310.85. And for those thinking long but fast: $TICS hitting $15 would mean $15,466.27 off just two hundred bucks. That’s not just projection—it’s math based on real presale pricing and stage-by-stage progression. And don’t forget: Qubetics isn’t a guessing game. With its mainnet launching in Q2 2025, this isn’t a “maybe someday” project—it’s a ticking countdown. For those in search of the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term , especially ones with real tech and community traction, this Qubetics presale ranks up there as possibly the best crypto presale of the year. Ethereum’s Updates Keep It Strong—but Competition’s Closing In Ethereum has been the king of smart contracts for years, and it’s not slowing down. Its recent push toward scaling with Layer 2 integrations like Arbitrum and Optimism is giving it the edge again. These upgrades are slashing gas fees and making apps way more usable, especially for retail community members. Ethereum also dropped proto-danksharding as part of its dev roadmap, which, when fully rolled out, will massively expand throughput. Beyond that, Ethereum’s growing real-world use cases are speaking volumes. From stablecoin settlements to NFT authentication, brands and enterprises are building directly on its infrastructure. That said, it’s not without flaws. It’s still slower than some new chains and definitely more expensive. But its brand trust, massive community, and ecosystem depth make it a reliable choice for those looking at best cryptos to buy and hold for short term—as long as they can handle the occasional gas fee spike. What’s impressive is Ethereum’s ability to maintain relevance even while newer chains try to eat its market share. It’s like the Apple of crypto—maybe not the fastest innovator anymore, but its upgrades still shake the entire industry. Whether you’re into staking, NFTs, or DeFi, Ethereum is still the hub where most real activity happens. Injective Is Gearing Up for Real-World Domination Injective might’ve started as a DeFi protocol, but it’s evolving fast into one of the most talked-about infrastructures in the Web3 space. With its recent $150M ecosystem initiative focused on real-world finance and AI integrations, Injective is making major moves. It already powers lightning-fast trading and synthetic asset creation—and now it’s expanding into AI-driven tools and tokenized RWAs (real-world assets). One of the key reasons Injective is heating up is its insane transaction speeds and gas efficiency. It’s built using the Cosmos SDK with native interoperability, meaning it can work seamlessly with other chains like Ethereum, Avalanche, and Cosmos without the typical bridge delays or security risks. That makes it especially attractive to developers trying to launch scalable apps. Injective also recently partnered with institutions exploring on-chain derivatives and synthetic trading products. This isn’t a side project anymore; it’s becoming serious infrastructure. For those scanning the charts and headlines looking for the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term, Injective might be one of the most underrated gems right now. It’s got the speed, the tech, and the partnerships to keep moving fast—without needing hype to fuel it. Conclusion: Three Chains, Three Plays—But Only One Still in Presale Ethereum is holding its place with deep integrations and continued innovation. Injective is proving that newer chains can deliver real-world performance with institutional-grade features. But Qubetics? It’s combining both—and doing it before the world fully catches on. It’s the only one of the three that’s still in presale, and it’s solving core blockchain problems while offering massive upside. For anyone seriously scanning the market for the best cryptos to buy and hold for short term, Qubetics is currently the one still priced under $0.20 but showing potential to climb to $15+ within the year. The tech is strong, the use case is crystal clear, and the presale model is built for rapid growth. Don’t be the one reading this article six months from now thinking, “Why didn’t I just act then?” There’s still time—join this crypto presale before it closes.

Each stage lasts 7 days and ends every Sunday at 12 a.m., with a 10% price increase at every new stage. How high can Qubetics ($TICS) go after presale? Projections estimate $TICS can reach $1 to $15, depending on adoption and mainnet traction. Current ROI estimates go up to 7,783.02%.

Despite the uncertainty, Lightchain AI continues to thrive, supported by robust fundamentals and increasing investor trust. With $19.5 million raised during its presale at just $0.007 per token, Lightchain AI’s innovative fusion of blockchain and AI is driving long-term investor interest. As weaker projects falter, Lightchain AI stands out with its expanding ecosystem and practical applications. Built on a solid foundation, this AI-powered blockchain project offers a promising opportunity for those seeking sustainable growth. Navigating Crypto Market Overwhelmed by Losses With all that, the crypto market in 2025 is on a rollercoaster ride, and lots of investors have devised ways to avoid huge losses and turbulent periods, right now. ​ Tax-loss harvesting is one of the best ways to achieve this, allowing investors to selectively realize capital losses by selling underperforming crypto assets. These losses can be used to offset gains from other investments or reduce taxable income by as much as $3,000 a year, with any excess losses rolled forward to subsequent tax years. U.S. tax laws do not currently apply the wash sale rule to cryptocurrencies, allowing you to repurchase the same asset soon after selling to keep your portfolio positions. Moreover, investors are also diversifying their portfolios by holding cash, investing in ETF, or with reallocating to more stable plays including bitcoin and real estate. Some are picking high-risk low-market-cap projects like leveraged ETFs and speculative altcoins whereas others are interested in long-term projects strong fundamentals. ​ Utilizing techniques such as dollar-cost averaging (DCA), staking, and yield farming in DeFi also can help to smooth out returns during periods of market price declines. In this unstable climate, keeping accurate records, working with tax professionals and keeping abreast of developments in the market should all be key action items for investors who hope to make the most out of losses. Why Lightchain AI’s Robust Foundation Builds Trust Lightchain AI stands out with its strong foundation, offering efficient data storage, seamless access mechanisms, and a unique integration of AI and blockchain technologies.

Memecoins have long been misunderstood, and amongst their great utility, there is an emerging perception that memecoins are simply conduits for celebrity-driven pump-and-dump schemes designed to rip the masses off. Despite this perception, and whilst some memecoins have certainly channelled a lot of capital into a small number of hands, this is far from the norm. Many memecoins can, and do, offer utility to users—from fractionalisation to predictive markets. You might also like: The memecoin phenomenon: When jokes print money | Opinion The focus must be on utility More must be done to shift this negative and overriding perception—if this misleading narrative is left to fester and grow, it could risk causing industry-wide damage. The memecoin industry must collectively do more to highlight the unique innovation behind memecoins and their utility for not just the crypto market but broader society, too. To develop projects that demonstrate this, AI is the best co-pilot. The role of AI AI agents are finely tuned to perform specialised tasks and make decisions with minimal or no human intervention, and they are deservedly having their moment in the spotlight. They supersede their less able genAI predecessors thanks to superior flexibility and intelligence, and in recent years, they have entered a transitional phase away from hype, speculation, and experimental novelties towards powerful real-world tools. They have transformed the tech space and are now an everyday tool for many businesses and consumers, applied to all forms of tech from user-facing technologies in self-driving cars to fraud detection technology. Yet the memecoin industry is still to capitalise on the benefits AI agents can offer—developers should harness the potential of AI in the development of their projects. If AI agents are applied in the right way, they offer a smart way to draw out the utility of memecoins and the broader application of AI agents across financial practices. This can be through integrating AI agents into the tokens directly or deploying AI agents to complement memecoin activity. Sophisticated trading tools A key example is the benefit AI agents can bring to memecoin trading tools. AI agents are capable of autonomously monitoring market trends and processing an incredibly high amount of data in a very quick time frame. They can provide real-time market sentiment analysis, adjust investment strategies , and identify market opportunities as the data is shifting, well before other market analysis tools. Applying this to memecoin markets is a no-brainer—this would allow market participants greater transparency amid the huge amount of complex data. There are thousands of memecoins, which cannot be thoroughly analysed by a single human or even a team. Instead, AI can very quickly process information around all memecoins and autonomously allocate accordingly. AROK, the AI-led venture agent, does precisely this—the autonomous trading tool conducts sentiment analysis, which is then used to automatically allocate assets to corresponding memecoins. Security guarantees Going hand in hand with an AI-led trading tool is AI agents’ ability to contribute to security and compliance related to memecoins. Lurking behind the flashy, eye-catching names of some memecoins is a malicious developer planning a rug pull. AI agents can prevent these—they could conduct smart contract auditing, AI-based code reviews, automated fraud detection, and regulatory compliance monitoring. They could conduct real-time risk assessments to identify and respond to emerging anomalies and risky memecoins, key to identifying genuine and viable investment opportunities and preventing pump-and-dumps and scams. Many industries are already using AI agents for detecting financial fraud; the memecoin industry must now take a similar approach. Driving community engagement Memecoins live and die by communities. So, perhaps the most significant benefit AI can bring to memecoins is productive community management. AI agents can accelerate meaningful community growth across an ecosystem through automated community management and the ability to personalise user interactions. AI-driven memecoin ecosystems can autonomously identify and build on trends generated amongst their community, and can also make decisions on behalf of coin holders. Terminal of Truths has successfully done so, capturing attention and driving its on-chain user activity, amassing over 200,000 followers. Memecoins have the power to transform society. But to ensure the industry continues growing, developers must focus on their next iteration to demonstrate genuine utility and overturn negative perceptions drawn from a handful of pump-and-dump schemes. AI agents offer a pragmatic way to do so. The next phase of memecoins shouldn’t be defined by celebrity-manufactured momentum—it should be driven by AI.

This rise follows a slight monthly decline of 0.15%. Over the last six months, ADA’s price has surged by 103.58%, showing strong long-term growth. The recent gain suggests renewed interest. The RSI is at 50.00, indicating a neutral stance. This means the price could move up or down, depending on market activity. ADA is nearing its resistance at $0.745. Breaking above could lead to more gains, possibly over 5%. The support level is at $0.592. Falling below might lead to declines. Polkadot gains nearly 7% in a week In the past week, Polkadot’s price increased by 11.80%, settling between $4.01 and $4.36. This rise comes after a monthly decline of 3.52%. Over the past six months, the price increased minimally by 0.17%, indicating relative stability in the long term. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 42.42. This suggests that the coin is nearing oversold territory but hasn’t reached it yet. An RSI below 30 typically indicates an oversold condition, which could signal a potential price increase as buyers step in. The nearest resistance level is at $4.40. If the price breaks above this point, it could signal further upward movement. The nearest support is at $3.80. If the price falls towards this level, it might find buyers who see it as a bargain. Given the recent weekly gain and the RSI, there’s potential for the price to rise. However, the monthly decline shows that caution is warranted. If the price moves above the resistance level, it could see gains beyond $4.50. Conversely, if it drops below the current range, it might approach the support at $3.31. Conclusion Established coins like ADA and DOT may offer stability. However, these assets might not deliver the rapid gains that some investors are looking for. Codename:Pepe crypto presents a compelling alternative. It utilizes advanced AI to navigate the chaotic memecoin landscape, providing automated trading and exclusive insights through a DAO membership.

Bitcoin shattered the world’s idea of decentralized money. Ethereum redefined what blockchains could build. XRP transformed cross-border finance. Now, a new name is making waves in early circles: MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . As the market evolves, these four projects are positioning themselves not just to recover previous highs—but to set new ones. And those paying close attention are seeing the opportunities stacking up fast. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Showing the Traits of a Future Leader New tokens launch every day—but few gain the kind of serious early traction that MAGACOINFINANCE is earning right now. From rapid wallet growth to expanding community conversations, this project is moving through its early phases with uncommon efficiency. The leadership team is delivering. The engagement is rising. And critically, smart investors are moving in while the mass market is still looking elsewhere. The blueprint is clear: build quietly, grow strategically, and scale when the foundation is strong. MAGACOINFINANCE is executing exactly on that path—and it’s why many believe it could be the next token to create new milestones. Supporting Momentum: Tron, Sei, and the New Builders Tron remains a transaction powerhouse. With one of the highest usage rates in terms of on-chain activity, Tron keeps expanding across emerging markets where low-cost, high-speed transactions are essential. Sei is making noise as a trading-first blockchain designed for speed and efficiency. Its early infrastructure has attracted developers looking for optimized performance in financial applications. Both platforms are creating important pieces of the next Web3 landscape—but they’ve already moved past their pure early-stage window. MAGACOINFINANCE is still there—and that’s where the greatest opportunity lives. Final Word Can XRP , Ethereum , Bitcoin , and MAGACOINFINANCE.COM surpass their previous milestones? The market conditions are aligning. Momentum is returning. And the next phase could reward those who positioned themselves early.

In a notable move, a whale withdrew $20 million worth of ADA from exchanges on April 24—historically a bullish signal that often precedes major price rallies. Whale Withdrawal: $20 million ADA moved off exchanges Current Market Cap: ~$24.68 billion 24-Hour Trading Volume: $540.9 million JUST IN: More than 20 million $ADA has been pulled from exchanges in the last 7 days—pointing to rising accumulation and long-term confidence in Cardano. pic.twitter.com/5Kow3irQs6 — TapTools (@TapTools) April 24, 2025 ADA remains supported above its key 50-day EMA ($0.6867), and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 38 suggests there’s still room for buyers to push higher. These technicals, combined with shrinking exchange supply, point to a setup where a sustained move above $1 could finally be within reach. Hydra Upgrade and DeFi Expansion Boost Fundamentals; Cardano Supported Beyond whale movements, Cardano’s ongoing protocol upgrades are enhancing its long-term strength. Hydra, the layer-2 scaling solution, successfully executed its first mainnet transaction batch, dramatically improving transaction speed and positioning Cardano as a serious player in high-frequency decentralized applications (dApps). Meanwhile, Mithril—a lightweight data certification protocol—is improving the wallet user experience by reducing sync times, making onboarding smoother for new users.

Cardano Faces Make-or-Break Resistance at $1 Despite bullish developments, ADA faces a critical technical barrier. The $0.99–$1.00 resistance zone aligns with a major descending trendline from February highs. Although ADA reclaimed its 50-day EMA, the MACD momentum is flattening, suggesting a cautious approach is still necessary. For traders, this is a textbook “breakout or fakeout” moment. A confirmed move above $1 with strong volume could open the door toward $1.05–$1.12. However, failure to clear this zone risks a pullback toward $0.6620 or even $0.5950. Trade Plan: Buy breakout: Above $1.00 Upside targets: $1.05 and $1.12 Sell on breakdown: Below $0.6860 Downside targets: $0.6620 and $0.5950 Stop-loss: Below $0.6860 for longs, above $1.00 for shorts Patience remains key—confirmation is essential before taking positions at major psychological levels like $1. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5M Milestone as 81% Yield Boosts Staking Demand Investor momentum behind BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) remains strong, with the Ethereum-based project officially surpassing the $5 million mark in its ongoing presale. As of today, $5.05 million has been raised out of a $5.74 million target, signaling rising urgency among buyers as the next price jump approaches. The current token price stands at $0.00248, offering a limited window before another repricing. High-Yield Staking with Flexible Access BTCBULL continues to set itself apart from typical meme assets by focusing on sustainable utility. The project’s staking program offers an estimated 81% annual yield, complemented by Bitcoin-backed distribution rewards. Crucially, users retain full liquidity with the ability to unstake anytime—no mandatory lockup periods or penalties. Latest Staking Snapshot: Total Tokens Staked: 1,293,025,857 BTCBULL Estimated Annual Yield: 81% APY Unstaking: Available at any time This flexible structure appeals to both yield hunters and investors seeking upside potential without giving up liquidity. Presale Snapshot: Final Stretch Before Repricing With less than $683,000 left before the next price adjustment, BTCBULL’s presale is rapidly entering its final stages at the current rate.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Memecoin fever is sweeping the crypto market as TRUMP surges on political hype and XYZVerse eyes a 30x breakout. Table of Contents Top TRUMP holders to meet US president XYZVerse on the memecoin spotlight: Bold concept and listing plans Conclusion: Memecoin momentum is back Memecoins are the wildest play in the crypto market. What are they? Just a joke, some would say. However, history knows real cases where a memecoin surged thousands of percent. Ask a SHIB holder who watched their $4,500 investment surge to nearly $15 million. But wait — there’s an even more stunning story. The cost of a pizza, just $27, turned into $52 million in the hands of a savvy PEPE investor. Today, memecoins are evolving beyond the promise of huge profits. They are coming with real-world perks, like landing a dinner with a president. Top TRUMP holders to meet US president The much-talked-about TRUMP memecoin just turned into a golden ticket. The project recently announced on its website that the top 220 TRUMP holders will have the opportunity to access an exclusive dinner with President Donald Trump. Boosted by this news, the TRUMP coin surged over 80% and its daily trading volume jumped over 500%. The price spiked to above $15 from around $8. TRUMP price analysis The TRUMP token is currently approaching its first resistance at $15.31. A break and close above this level would be a significant bullish trigger, likely drawing fresh buying interest from traders looking to ride the momentum. Should TRUMP clear this resistance decisively, the next target would be at $20.61. However, failure to break through the first resistance could result in a short-term consolidation in the $9.00–$12.00 range before another breakout attempt. The TRUMP memecoin has broken into the headlines and made much noise. But behind this noise, another memecoin project is building momentum, and its launch could be a sensation judging by the enthusiasm of its community. You might also like: SUI or SEI: Which one will dominate the 2025 bull market? AI has a radical take XYZVerse on the memecoin spotlight: Bold concept and listing plans XYZVerse has come under the spotlight as the first-ever all-sports memecoin. This fresh concept is appealing to a large user base; from sports fans to crypto enthusiasts. This is the first reason XYZVerse stands out in the crowded memecoin space. Currently in presale, XYZ tokens are offered at $0.003333, a fraction of the planned listing price of $0.10. For early investors, this creates a high-upside opportunity. A presale participant putting in $100 could walk away with roughly $3,000 once the token hits exchanges assuming it lists at the projected 10-cent mark. That’s nearly 30-times growth before the token starts its post-listing journey. With the right combination of hype, community support, and exchange momentum, XYZ could push far beyond its initial target, offering early holders an even bigger windfall. XYZ builds strong momentum ahead of listing XYZVerse is charging toward its public debut with impressive momentum. Now in Stage 12 of 15, the presale has already raised over $13 million. XYZVerse has quickly become a hot topic across Reddit, CoinMarketCap, and other crypto communities, where influencers and early backers are actively discussing its potential. Some users have been posting rather optimistic predictions for XYZVerse. Positive sentiment at this level is a powerful indicator, especially as the presale moves into its final phases. With Stage 13 approaching fast, the token price is set to rise to $0.005, inching closer to the projected $0.10 listing price. How to buy XYZ in presale XYZVerse is currently in its presale phase, and the only way to buy is directly through the project’s official website . Step 1: Set up a crypto wallet To participate in the presale, users need a crypto wallet. Users who don’t already have one, can easily download the app and create a wallet. Step 2: Add the right network Once the wallet is ready, users need to ensure it’s set to the correct blockchain network. XYZVerse supports multiple chains, including Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Tron, Solana, Polygon, and BNB Smart Chain (BSC). In MetaMask, go to Settings, Networks, Add Network, and enter the relevant network details. Some networks may already be available by default. XYZ can also be bought with Visa or Mastercard for those who prefer fiat payments. Step 3: Connect the wallet to XYZVerse Head over to the official XYZVerse website and open the dApp interface. Click on “Connect Wallet” and select the wallet in use. Approve the connection through the wallet prompt. Step 4: Select the payment token Click the token dropdown and choose the preferred currency. XYZVerse accepts popular cryptos like USDT, ETH, BNB, and others. Make sure there’s enough balance to cover both the token purchase and gas fees. Step 5: Enter the amount to buy Users can either input the amount of XYZ tokens they want to buy or specify how much crypto they’d like to spend. The system will auto-calculate the equivalent amount. Step 6: Confirm and finalize the purchase Once everything looks good, hit the “Buy XYZ” button. A confirmation screen will come from the wallet. Approve the transaction, and that’s it. The XYZ tokens will appear in the balance once the transaction is complete. Final tip Always double-check that it’s the official XYZVerse website to avoid scams or fake presale pages. Bookmark the site and only use verified links from trusted sources. Conclusion: Memecoin momentum is back If there’s one thing the crypto world never runs short of, its surprises — and memecoins are back in the spotlight with full force. Between TRUMP blazing ahead with political energy and headline hype, and XYZVerse turning heads with its presale buzz and potential 30x returns, two different stories are unfolding — but both are riding the same wave of meme-fueled momentum. TRUMP has already demonstrated how fast things can move when narrative meets market appetite. It’s unpredictable, wild, and driven by sentiment, but that’s the nature of memecoins. On the other hand, XYZVerse is playing the long game. Building quietly, stage by stage, with a growing community that’s betting big on its potential before it even hits the exchanges. But as with any early-stage crypto project, especially in the memecoin and hype-driven categories, risk is part of the equation. Presales can be volatile, and not every project achieves its listing goals or long-term viability. To learn more about XYZVerse, visit their website , Telegram , or X .

Listed under the ticker XRPH11, the fund has begun trading on Brazil’s B3 exchange. XRPH11, which tracks the Nasdaq XRP Reference Price Index, is designed to allocate at least 95% of its net assets directly to XRP. Hashdex noted that exposure to XRP can be achieved through direct coin ownership, futures contracts that replicate the index’s performance, or other financial instruments that mirror Nasdaq’s benchmark. XRP Spot ETFs have not yet been approved in the US, but Bloomberg analysts believe that many altcoin ETFs, including XRP, will eventually gain approval under the Trump administration. This launch marks Hashdex’s ninth ETF offering in B3, expanding its single-asset crypto ETF lineup that already includes products linked to Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL). Related News: Will History Repeat Itself in Bitcoin (BTC)?

Trading for less than a dollar, these four tokens show signs of significant growth ahead. This article explores why these affordable digital assets might be on the verge of explosive gains, highlighting the factors that could propel them upward in the near future. Investor Demand Powers $XYZ Capitalization to the $15M Milestone The XYZVerse ($XYZ) project, which merges the worlds of sports and crypto, has attracted significant investor interest. Unlike typical memecoins, XYZVerse positions itself as a long-term initiative with a clear roadmap and an engaged community. The project was recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project , further solidifying its appeal. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.003333, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.005. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $10 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $15 million . This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse , the community calls the plays . Active contributors aren’t just spectators—they’re rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It’s a game where the most passionate players win big. $XYZ Charging up for a Championship Run With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price , and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More – Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Terra Classic: Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain Innovation Terra Classic (LUNC) has carved its niche in the cryptocurrency world by blending stability with innovation. Originally launched in April 2019, Terra is a blockchain platform that uses stablecoins linked to traditional currencies. This means it offers digital coins that match the value of currencies like the U.S. dollar, South Korean won, and even the Mongolian tugrik. By doing this, Terra provides a way to make fast and affordable payments worldwide, without the wild price swings often seen in other cryptocurrencies. In May 2022, Terra entered a new phase when it launched a new chain and rebranded from its Terra Classic narrative. Its native token became LUNA Classic (LUNC), in a move reminiscent of the 2017 Ethereum-Ethereum Classic split. Terra Classic was supposed to offer the best of both worlds: promote adoption of traditional money and popularize the decentralized strengths of blockchain technology. Fast forward to today. The market has changed so much, but LUNC still represents an interesting option for traders looking for a combination of stability and some other advantages crypto offers. While giants like Bitcoin and Ethereum capture headlines with their volatility, Terra Classic focuses on steady growth and real-world usability, which could make it an appealing choice for many investors. Stellar Lumens Bridges a Chasm in Global Payment Systems Stellar Lumens (XLM) is changing the way we think about moving money around the world. Launched in 2014, Stellar is a decentralized network that uses blockchain to make fast and cheap transfers possible. Unlike some cryptocurrencies that aim to replace banks, Stellar works to connect different financial systems. It doesn’t favor any one currency. Instead, it allows any type of money—dollars, euros, bitcoins—to move across its network with ease. Big companies have noticed; they’ve partnered with Stellar to take advantage of its technology. With billions of transactions processed, Stellar shows that blockchain can work hand-in-hand with traditional finance. Stellar appears to be in a promising position in the current market, shining based on its advantages in terms of real-world solutions. While some cryptocurrencies struggle to settle in a niche, Stellar has consolidated its reputation in enhancing everyday money-handling solutions, offering tools and simple apps for people to send funds globally. Businesses can also use Stellar to create blockchain apps or run currency exchanges. Kaspa’s BlockDAG Revolution: A Faster Future for Cryptocurrency Kaspa is a relatively new entrant into the digital finance space, running a proof-of-work system like Bitcoin, but with an important wrinkle. Instead of building blocks one after another, Kaspa allows simultaneous block creation. It then uses its GHOSTDAG protocol to ensure these parallel blocks aren’t discarded; rather, they are arranged based on consensus that form a blockDAG—a network that looks more like a web than a chain. That is how Kaspa runs a system that can process blocks faster than any available alternatives. It currently completes one transaction per second, but efficiency goals are set at ten or even a hundred per second. Kaspa’s technology makes a strong case in a market where quick transaction finality is key. Features like data pruning and plans for layer 2 solutions make it appealing to both developers and users. Kaspa also has a solid foundation to build upon. Conclusion LUNC, XLM, and KAS look primed for growth, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out above them all. The unique sports memecoin with a community-driven ecosystem has a historic upside that makes 20,000% gains look like a realistic target.

43862092,https://cryptonews.com/?p=355365,1745751373,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/43862092.jpeg,Dogecoin Price Skyrockets 17.7% This Week: DOGE’s $27.8B Market Cap Now Towers Over Cardano – What’s Next?,https://cryptonews.com/news/dogecoin-price-skyrockets-17-7-this-week-doges-27-8b-market-cap-now-towers-over-cardano-whats-next/,"Dogecoin (DOGE) is stealing the spotlight once again. After rallying 17.7% this week, DOGE now boasts a $27.8 billion market cap—leapfrogging Cardano (ADA) to reclaim a top spot among major cryptocurrencies. Despite a minor 1.4% dip in the past 24 hours, Dogecoin is trading around $0.1810 on April 27, holding strong after a major breakout move. The technical landscape shows Dogecoin exiting a falling wedge pattern, typically a bullish setup. Strong support has formed around $0.143 and $0.16, providing a sturdy foundation for further gains as bullish sentiment continues to build. Dogecoin Defends Trendline as Bulls Eye $0.24 Technically , Dogecoin remains well-supported above a rising trendline formed since mid-April, with the 50 EMA ($0.1788) offering additional stability. Immediate resistance sits at $0.1878. A breakout above this level could open the door for a test of $0.1929, with a broader push toward $0.24 if momentum holds. #Dogecoin holding firm at $0.1810, defending key trendline support. A breakout above $0.1878 could trigger a rally toward $0.1929 and $0.24. Support to watch: $0.1788. Momentum building — patience key before confirmation. $DOGE pic.twitter.com/OUq7DW6D1Z — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) April 27, 2025 Trade Plan: Buy breakout: Above $0.1878 Upside target: $0.1929 and $0.24 Support zone: $0.1788 Stop-loss: Below $0.1740 For beginners, this setup is known as “trendline defense”—buyers step in along rising support to maintain upward momentum. Patience is critical: only act after a clean breakout with strong volume confirmation. Dogecoin: Analysts See Potential Run Toward $1 in 2025 Market analysts, including Trader Tardigrade , believe Dogecoin could mirror its historic rallies, targeting a potential move toward $1 by May 2025. Achieving that would propel Dogecoin’s market cap closer to $100 billion, recreating the euphoria seen during its 2021 bull run. The Dogecoin price looks set to witness a breakout above the psychological $1 level, having broken a resistance trendline. Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade provided a timeline for when this massive surge could happen as DOGE rallies to a new all-time high (ATH). pic.twitter.com/Ex2jISusss — Lu Chunquan (@LChunquan) April 27, 2025 Several catalysts support this bullish view: Bitcoin nearing $94K, lifting the broader market mood. Ethereum, Solana, and XRP registering double-digit weekly gains. Surging retail interest and increased whale accumulation. However, Dogecoin must first clear critical resistance at $0.24 to unlock larger gains. Final Outlook: Strong Base, but Breakout Confirmation Needed Dogecoin’s fundamentals are strengthening, and its market cap dominance signals renewed investor interest. But the road to higher prices hinges on clearing immediate resistance. A confirmed move above $0.1878, backed by volume, could be the spark for a run toward $0.24—and beyond. Until then, cautious optimism remains the smart play. Solana’s First L2? Solaxy Hits $31.91M as Presale Nears $32.6M Goal After Dogecoin’s trendline bounce shows traders chasing short-term momentum, attention is quietly shifting toward deeper infrastructure plays—especially within the Solana ecosystem. While Bitcoin dominates institutional headlines, innovation on Solana is heating up with one Layer-2 project leading the charge. Solaxy Bridges Solana and Ethereum Solaxy (SOLX) is directly tackling Solana’s congestion challenge by processing transactions off-chain and submitting them back to the mainnet in bundles. A built-in bridge with Ethereum enables seamless cross-chain interoperability, reducing fees and boosting network efficiency without sacrificing security. By bundling transactions before submission, Solaxy alleviates load on Solana’s base layer while maintaining decentralization. Its cross-chain bridge further strengthens user flexibility, allowing assets to move smoothly between ecosystems—positioning Solaxy as an infrastructure backbone for multi-chain applications. Presale Update: Momentum Accelerates Solaxy’s presale continues to build momentum, now surpassing $31.91 million out of its $32.59 million target. With the next price adjustment fast approaching, SOLX remains priced at $0.001706—up from its earlier $0.0016 phase. Presale Snapshot (as of now): Current Token Price: $0.001706 USDT Raised: $31,919,230.80 out of $32,593,211 Solaxy has been audited by Coinsult and is backed by over 60,000 followers on X and 11,500 Telegram subscribers. Its strong community support, combined with real technical utility, has made it one of the top-watched presale projects in the Solana ecosystem. With momentum building and the funding goal nearly complete, Solaxy is positioning itself not just as another token launch, but as a serious player in solving real infrastructure challenges for Web3.

ZKsync recovered $5.7M from a hack, and the SEC postponed decisions on Polkadot and Hedera ETFs amid rising regulatory activity. Let’s find out more. Bitcoin The U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs bought another sizable amount of BTC on Thursday, bringing the total inflow so far this week to 29.45K BTC, equivalent to $2.65 billion. Business Stripe , a global payments platform, is building its first stablecoin financial product for companies based outside the United States, the United Kingdom, and Europe to expand the footprint of the Dollar in global markets. Coinbase, the largest publicly listed cryptocurrency exchange, has announced that it will waive transaction fees for trades involving PayPal’s stablecoin, PYUSD. The move, part of a wider strategic collaboration between the two firms, aims to promote the adoption of stablecoins in mainstream payment systems and digital commerce. Trump Media has partnered with Crypto.com and Yorkville America Digital to launch a series of “Made in America” crypto-focused ETFs under its Truth.Fi brand, marking its formal entry into the digital asset investment market. Deutsche Bank and Standard Chartered are considering expanding their crypto operations into the United States, driven by favorable regulatory developments, client demand, and long-term strategic positioning. Tokyo-listed Metaplanet has purchased an additional 330 BTC worth $28.2 million, lifting its total holdings to over $423 million and positioning it as Asia’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder. Web3 Verifiable AI is becoming a palpable trend as public awareness of the downsides of black-box AI grows. Decentralized money markets allow users to lend and borrow cryptocurrencies and tokenized assets on-chain, and they need nothing but an internet connection. Alongside the growth of DeFi in general, these markets have been a rapidly growing use case of smart contracts, with all the latter's pluses and minuses. Security The ZKsync Association has successfully recovered approximately $5.7 million worth of digital assets following a security breach earlier this month. The resolution came after the hacker responsible for the incident accepted a bounty offer and returned the majority of the stolen tokens within a designated timeframe. A critical security incident has compromised a widely used software library in the Ripple XRP ecosystem, putting thousands of crypto wallets at risk. Regulation The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extended its decision deadlines for two crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals tied to Polkadot (DOT) and Hedera (HBAR), as the agency continues to navigate an expanding pipeline of digital asset fund applications. Russia’s finance ministry and central bank are moving forward with plans to establish a state-backed cryptocurrency exchange exclusively for the country’s wealthiest investors.

43863231,https://timestabloid.com/?p=65137,1745751613,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Cardano (ADA) Fans Abandon $10 Dream After Emerging Analysis Proves It Impossible, While Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Continues to Attract Investors",https://timestabloid.com/cardano-ada-fans-abandon-10-dream-after-emerging-analysis/,"Analysis reveals that ADA token supporters face an unpleasant fact because research dismisses the possibility of ADA reaching $10 during the period of 2031. Cardano maintains a weekly increase of 14.99% as its price stands at $0.69 but resilience stems from whale accumulation along with positive technical patterns. Analysis shows $1.03 will be the maximum price for ADA in 2025 because DeFi adoption has slowed down and NFT popularity remains limited. The investor community strongly focuses on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as its fourth stage presale moves forward at $0.025 per token to raise $7.2 million from 9,100 investors who purchased 425 million tokens. The presale phase of MUTM’s token is at phase 4 at $0.025 per token has overall attracted $7.2 million investment from 9,100 holders who acquired 425 million tokens. The cryptocurrency market is currently favoring practical-use projects as demonstrated by this rapid increase in adoption. Cardano’s Fading Momentum Cardano remains a bright prospect because whale investors keep buying large token quantities throughout market declines thereby reinforcing market belief. The Relative Strength Index stands at 57 indicating an upward market trend while analysts predict that $0.80 will serve as a crucial price target. Integration with BitcoinOS and potential ETF approval spark long-term hope. However, challenges loom large. Market participants are taking profits from Cardano based on recent large whale transactions of 180 million tokens and falling Mean Dollar Invested Age indicators. Cardano faces a weak outlook because it fails to expand its DeFi and NFT sectors effectively. The declining hopes for reaching $10 price target have steered investors to evaluate promising tokens including Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance’s Presale The crypto market has turned its attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) because of its phase 4 presale at $0.025. The 11-phase plan sells through this current stage at a fast pace due to investor panic about stock depletion. Purchasers who invest at phase 4 will earn 20 percent in profit once phase 5 starts at $0.03. New coin distribution strategies establish a $0.06 target price that provides investors with a 140% profitable outcome. According to experts MUTM tokens will increase to $2.50 after launch which would provide a 9,900% ROI benefit. A new dashboard introduction revealed the positions of the top 50 token holders who receive additional rewards for keeping their rankings so that user engagement keeps growing. Security and Utility Drive Demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM) team members actively work on obtaining a smart contract audit through CertiK while placing trust at the forefront of their priorities. The finished security results will be distributed through social media platforms to strengthen investor trust. The decentralized lending structure of the project provides real value for users who can obtain yield from their assets or use their assets as collateral. The buy-and-distribute system uses platform revenue to purchase and sustain the demand for tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a strategic DeFi entrance through its $7.2 million funding and 9,100 investor base which establishes it as different from the gradual Cardano DeFi marketplace advancement. Shifting Tides in Crypto The projected $10 value of Cardano faces major obstacles which make that value goal difficult or impossible to achieve. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting investors because it offers entry into its presale at affordable rates together with solid returns. Phase 4 investors who buy their MUTM tokens for $0.025 should recognize this price point as a temporary opportunity because phase 5 will introduce a 20% increase to future token values.

The former candidate for the US Senate to represent Massachusetts believes Bankman-Fried deserved every year of his punishment and even called for his parents to be charged. Some claim Bankman-Fried’s 25-year sentence was excessive One crypto community member sparked a debate over Bankman-Fried’s sentence. In an X post, he pointed out that the FTX founder’s punishment was too harsh. He argued that the exchange’s users were being compensated in full plus interest. He continued that the exchange was not entirely bankrupt, and only had liquidity issues. He even believes that the FTX scandal was not a case of deliberate, malicious fraud, but reckless mismanagement fueled by ideologies like utilitarianism and effective altruism. His comments, however, were not taken lightly, and some criticized him for defending SBF. Nonetheless, the account going by “Zach” clarified that he did not believe the FTX founder was innocent, only that he found a 25-year sentence without parole for mismanagement and poor decisions excessive. Attorney John Deaton believes SBF’s parents should be in jail Contrary to Zach, John Deaton claimed that SBF’s sentence was justified, believing he deserved his 25-year sentence. Deaton even went as far as to say SBF’s parents should have been charged. Responding to Zach’s X post, he remarked, “Not only did he deserve the 25 years, his father, Joe Bankman, and his mother, Barbara Fried, also deserve to be in prison. Even his so-called altruism was fraudulent, proven by evidence submitted at trial in the form of his private messages.” Deaton added that Bankman-Fried has yet to show any remorse for any of his crimes. Moreover, he argued that the campaign finance fraud charges against SBF should never have been dismissed. He even called for Pam Bondi, Florida’s former Attorney General, to reopen the case. He asserted that the charges were only dropped because the case involved several elected officials. He claimed SBF even contributed $10 million to the Biden administration, after which the former SEC chair Gary Gensler met with him multiple times. Nevertheless, some crypto community members believe Sam Bankman-Fried could receive leniency since federal prosecutors and regulators have lessened their grip on crypto cases. Lately, regulators have been paying more attention to crimes linked to crypto assets, leaving the rest in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s hands. Speaking with commentator and host Tucker Carlson, Bankman-Fried acknowledged that he could stay in jail until his late fifties without any intervention. However, the shifting dynamic in Washington leaves hope that he could be pardoned, as was the case with ex-BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes. Bankman-Fried was recently shifted to the low-security Terminal Island Federal Correctional Institution. Before that, he was located at the Victorville medium-security facility, a notoriously violent place, according to prison consultant firm Elizabeth Franklin-Best. Samuel Goldfaden, a partner at the crypto-centric law firm DLT Law, said that while his previous facility was violent, Bankman-Fried had been held in a safer part of the facility. According to Goldfaden, Sam Bankman-Fried spent most of his detention in the more secure dorm units of MDC Brooklyn, reportedly alongside other high-profile inmates such as Sean P. Diddy to ensure his safety. Terminal Island, which once housed notorious mobster Al Capone, American criminal and cult leader Charles Manson, and LSD advocate Timothy Leary, currently accommodates over 900 inmates, including other convicted fraudsters like video game entrepreneur Mouli Cohen.

As Bitcoin (BTC) continues its surge, Solana (SOL) drives blockchain innovation, and XRP pushes adoption, smart investors are quietly expanding their focus to strategic early entries. One project now gaining real traction is MAGACOINFINANCE —a rare opportunity still positioned before the mainstream floodgates open. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Being Positioned for Major Growth in 2025 In a cycle increasingly driven by early discovery, MAGACOINFINANCE is standing out for all the right reasons. With strong early traction, disciplined expansion, and real community growth, it’s moving onto major radar screens across trader groups and analyst circles. Based on current momentum, structural design, and early accumulation behavior, MAGACOINFINANCE is being confidently projected into the 55x potential tier by early trackers—an upside many believe could mirror previous stealth-phase breakouts like Solana and XRP. Other Noteworthy Movers: SOL, INJ, KAS, and UNI Solana (SOL) continues leading Layer-1 innovation with speed and developer adoption. Injective (INJ) is carving a niche with its high-performance trading protocols. Kaspa (KAS) is gaining attention for its unique blockDAG architecture. Uniswap (UNI) remains the backbone of decentralized exchange infrastructure. While these projects are strong, MAGACOINFINANCE offers the rarest edge—early positioning where future momentum is still fully ahead. Final Word In crypto, fortunes are made by those who position early, not those who follow late. While XRP, Solana, and Cardano remain pillars of strength, MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is carving out its own path—still private, still early, and now gaining the kind of traction that hints at something much larger ahead.

Ossoff, a Democrat currently seeking reelection, cited concerns over Trump’s involvement with a cryptocurrency project tied to his name. Ossoff Criticizes Trump Speaking to attendees, Ossoff criticized Trump’s plan to host a private dinner for the top holders of the Official Trump memecoin. “I mean, I saw just 48 hours ago, he is granting audiences to people who buy his meme coin,” Ossoff said, according to a report by NBC News. “When the sitting president of the United States is selling access for what are effectively payments directly to him, there is no question that that rises to the level of an impeachable offense,” he added. However, the Senator acknowledged that impeachment would be unlikely without a shift in Congressional power. At present, Trump’s Republican Party holds a majority in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Ossoff suggested that real movement toward impeachment could only happen if Democrats gain control of Congress during the 2026 midterm elections. The controversy stems from an announcement made on April 23 via the Official Trump memecoin website. It revealed plans for an exclusive dinner at Trump’s Washington , D.C., golf club, inviting the top 220 TRUMP token holders. The website also launched a leaderboard to track wallet rankings and provided a registration link for potential attendees. Following the news, the price of the TRUMP token surged over 50%, according to CoinMarketCap data. While the guest list remains uncertain, the website specifies that participants must pass a background check, cannot hail from countries on Know Your Customer (KYC) watchlists, and are not permitted to bring guests. Experts Raise Alarm On April 25, the team behind TRUMP addressed rumors circulating online that individuals would need at least $300,000 worth of tokens to attend. They clarified that the cutoff should be determined using the leaderboard, excluding locked tokens, exchange holdings, and non-participating wallets. Meanwhile, legal experts have raised alarms about Trump’s deeper involvement in the crypto space. Charlyn Ho, a partner at law firm Rikka, warned that Trump’s personal financial interests through ventures like the TRUMP memecoin and the Trump-linked DeFi protocol World Liberty Financial could present serious conflicts of interest , particularly as the president signs executive orders impacting the digital assets sector.

While price volatility has settled, there’s still no sign of a strong recovery. Adding to the frustration, crypto payment platform Banxa has reportedly paused Pi transactions, likely due to pending Know Your Business (KYB) approval. Banxa previously purchased millions of Pi at low prices and may return once approval is granted and Pi’s price improves. Meanwhile, it’s been over two months since Pi Network won Binance’s community vote by a wide margin, yet the token remains unlisted. Hope sparked again on April 25, when Binance released new listing guidelines, prompting fresh speculation. Binance’s new evaluation framework stresses strong fundamentals, adoption metrics, tokenomics, team credibility, and compliance. For projects like Pi, which already have a circulating token, special attention is given to trading volume, liquidity, and market performance. However, major challenges remain. Pi is not yet operating on any of the four blockchains currently supported by Binance (BNB Chain, Solana, Base, and Ethereum). Without integration into a supported chain or a clear timeline for expansion, Pi’s path to a Binance listing remains uncertain. Pi Coin Price Prediction? Pi is currently trading in a tight range, with price compressing inside a wedge pattern. Key resistance is at $0.65, and a confirmed breakout above $0.65—especially with strong volume—could spark a sharp rally. However, if the price fails to break above this level, it may fall back to test support around $0.60. Crypto analyst Dr Altcoin said, “Pi is doing well! I am fairly confident that the price pumping of Pi might start during the Consensus Summit (May 14–16, 2025) rather than at the end of August when Pi unlocking significantly reduces.”",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-27 11:08:34

Mantra ( OM ), a major player in the Real World Asset tokenization, traded at $0.5086 on Sunday, down 95% from its highest level this year. This performance indicates that investors are still skeptical about the coin after its crash two weeks ago. While the management has attributed the collapse to forced liquidations by an exchange, users believe it was because of insiders dumping tokens . They question why Mantra was the only coin to have such forced liquidations.

In addition to Mulln’s token burn, the company will burn 300 OM tokens from its Treasury. A token burn reduces the number of those in circulation and potentially boosts its price. Mantra has also hopes to implement a $109 million token buyback. A buyback increases demand for tokens and can help to stabilize its price. The team has also pledged to implement more transparency. However, it is unlikely that these actions will be effective because the trust among investors is gone . OM price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the OM price collapsed earlier this month. It dropped from a high of $9.10 in March to $0.50 today, erasing over $7.5 billion in value. The Mantra price has crumbled below all moving averages, a sign that bears remain in control. It has also formed a bearish pennant pattern, which consists of a vertical line and a triangle pattern. Therefore, while the Mantra coin may seem cheap, there is a likelihood that it will continue falling over time. It may drop to the next point at $0.2330, the lowest swing in February last year. The only caveat is that failed projects like Celsius, FTX, and Safemoon often experience short squeezes.

Arctic Pablo Coin Hits Stage 20 with $2.33M Raised—Will Ponke and Cat Keep Up?,https://timestabloid.com/from-0-000099-to-the-moon-arctic-pablo-coin-hits-stage-20/,"Ever felt like you missed the boat on the last big meme coin? With the market heating up again, three names are turning heads and wallets—each for different reasons. While most investors chase hype, the smart ones dig deeper, looking for mechanisms and movements that spell long-term potential. This week, Ponke broke into the top trending tokens with a new community-driven reward system, while Cat in a Dog’s World stunned analysts with its record engagement across Solana. But nothing is gathering steam quite like Arctic Pablo Coin (APC)—a newcomer blending humor, narrative-driven presale mechanics, and a deflationary model that has serious investors paying attention. This article dives into the latest developments surrounding Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Ponke, and Cat in a Dog’s World. But spoiler alert: APC is stealing the spotlight—and here’s why. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflation Drive: Weekly Token Burns Making $APC a Scarce Gem Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) isn’t just riding the meme wave—it’s rewriting the playbook with a burn strategy designed to tighten supply and elevate long-term value. This deflationary mechanism involves permanently removing all unsold tokens every single week during its presale phase. That’s not a one-time burn—it’s a recurring process that drastically reduces circulating supply. What makes this approach even more intriguing is its on-chain transparency. Each burn is recorded on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), providing visible, irreversible proof of token elimination. Once the presale wraps, all leftover tokens will meet the same fiery fate, amplifying scarcity and potentially boosting value over time. It’s a bold move that sets $APC apart in a saturated meme coin presale market—and it may just be one of the best crypto to invest in before the final stage hits. Frostbite City Frenzy: Arctic Pablo Coin Hits Stage 20 at $0.000099 Arctic Pablo Coin’s epic presale journey has just reached its 20th milestone—Frostbite City—and crypto circles are buzzing. The meme coin presale model it follows doesn’t rely on traditional stages. Instead, Arctic Pablo “travels” through imaginative locations, each unlocking new pricing tiers. What’s astonishing is how fast the previous 19 stages wrapped up—each phase sold out sooner than expected. Now priced at just $0.000099, APC is in its 20th location, offering a staggering ROI of 7969.70% compared to the final listing price of $0.008. So far, the campaign has raised over $2.33 million, and with momentum accelerating, the current price may not last long. As each new “city” arrives, price levels shift upward. Frostbite City could close at any moment, marking this as potentially the final chance to enter the meme coin presale at such a low entry point. This Arctic expedition isn’t just another meme project—it might be the best crypto to invest in this season. Ponke Unveils Layered Rewards Protocol Amid Rapid User Growth Ponke is surging this week after announcing its highly anticipated Layered Rewards Protocol, a new mechanism that allows long-term holders to stake tokens across tiered levels to earn exclusive benefits. The community-backed meme coin has witnessed a sharp rise in wallet activity and liquidity since the update, with over 25,000 active addresses engaging with the token in the past 48 hours. This uptick follows news that several major Solana-based influencers have joined the Ponke movement, pushing its visibility beyond meme territory and into what some are calling a utility-driven shift. Cat in a Dog’s World Launches NFT-Based Utility Bridge Cat in a Dog’s World just released an NFT-based utility bridge, enabling holders to convert their NFTs into staking assets that grant governance voting power and yield rewards. The update has resonated deeply within the Solana ecosystem, with a 37% spike in active users and over 18,000 new NFT conversions in just three days. As the project pivots toward ecosystem-building, the development suggests a clear trajectory toward sustainable tokenomics while maintaining its satirical charm. Verdict: Which Coin is Leading the Charge? Each of these three meme tokens is bringing fresh energy to the market—Ponke with gamified rewards, Cat in a Dog’s World with NFT staking—but Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is making the loudest splash right now. With its strategic meme coin presale, innovative location-based rollout, and aggressive weekly token burns, it offers a mix of storytelling and scarcity that’s rare to see in this genre. For those seeking the best crypto to invest in before prices leap forward, Arctic Pablo Coin might just be the last train to catch—and it’s already halfway to the station. Don’t miss out while Frostbite City is still open. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ Frequently Asked Questions What is Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) and how does its presale work? Arctic Pablo Coin is a meme coin featuring a location-based presale model where each new stage introduces a higher token price. Why is Arctic Pablo Coin burning tokens during the presale? To boost scarcity and value, APC eliminates all unsold tokens weekly, creating a deflationary supply that supports long-term growth. What is the current stage of the Arctic Pablo Coin presale? The presale is currently in Stage 20, known as Frostbite City, with the token priced at $0.000099. How much has Arctic Pablo Coin raised so far? The project has already raised over $2.33 million through its meme coin presale. Is Arctic Pablo Coin the best crypto to invest in 2025? With its unique presale structure, token burns, and community-driven hype, many consider it one of the best crypto opportunities this year.

This level is considered highly important in both technical trading and natural patterns, and often marks strong turning points in price. Bitcoin reaching this level suggests the recent rally may be slowing down, and traders are watching closely to see what happens next. So far, Bitcoin has shown signs of a possible five-wave move from its April low. If this pattern completes, it would be a clear sign of bullish strength and could open the door for further gains. However, if the move turns out to be only a three-wave structure, it may mean that the market is still in a broader bear trend, and this recent rise was just a temporary recovery. Key support for the current trend is between $84,526 and $88,494. As long as the price stays above this zone, the outlook remains positive in the short term. There is also a minor support zone between $91,047 and $93,581 that could help hold the price up in the coming days. Traders should keep an eye on these levels. If Bitcoin can hold above support and break past the $94,250 resistance with strong momentum, the next target could be as high as $130,000 in the longer term.

But for those chasing asymmetric gains, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight. Investors are currently purchasing MUTM tokens at presale for $0.025, and over $7.2 million has been raised so far. Over 9,100 participants are already onboard, and many predict the price will shift to $0.03 in the next presale phase. Investors who join now can realize a 140% gain upon the token hitting the projected launch price of $0.06. That same $1,000 placed in MUTM could balloon into a staggering $50,000, according to bullish forecasts fueled by whale accumulation and rising DeFi traction. While XRP offers reliability, MUTM is drawing those who don’t just want gains—they want a game-changer. Mutuum Finance Presale: A New DeFi Platform Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming a performer to reckon with in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) market, thanks to its innovative crypto lending products. The presale has already accumulated over $7.2 million, with more than 9,100 investors having already participated. Currently priced at $0.025, MUTM tokens will transition to $0.03 in the next presale phase, and early investors stand to earn up to 140% profit when the token hits its estimated launch price of $0.06. The platform’s advanced lending system is disrupting decentralized markets, and it is positioning the platform as one of the leading DeFi projects. The results of the Certik smart contract audit will be released soon, offering additional transparency and assurance to investors. Rewarding Early Investors & Building the Mutuum Finance Community Mutuum Finance offers attractive rewards for early adopters in an attempt to build a strong, active community. Under the program, the platform is conducting a $100,000 giveaway contest, in which ten participants are awarded $10,000 in MUTM tokens. Additionally, the referral program encourages users to invite others to the ecosystem, promoting organic growth. Early adopters gain exclusive access to staking, voting rights, and priority platform updates, making them significantly invested in the project’s development. To additionally promote price stability, Mutuum Finance operates in a stablecoin environment, where users are allowed to deposit USD funds. This approach eliminates the traditional instability issues of the old financial systems, while establishing a safer and more stable transactional environment. Mutuum Finance’s utilization of modern lending innovations is ushering in lasting changes in the DeFi ecosystem. The Dual-Model Crypto Lending System One of the features of Mutuum Finance is the double-lending model of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending frameworks. In the P2C framework, it leverages the smart contract pools to offer stablecoin lending with the option for users to earn passive income during lending. In contrast, the P2P framework removes intermediates, offering direct interaction between borrowers and lenders, giving both parties greater freedom. Auto-adjusting interest rates also make the platform more efficient, with better balance between returns for lenders and borrowing costs for users. While Ripple (XRP) offers a solid 5x return potential over the next 100 days, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a far more explosive upside. With over $7.2 million raised from 9,100+ investors and presale tokens still available at $0.025, the opportunity to secure a possible 50x return before launch is quickly vanishing. Don’t settle for steady when you can go exponential. Join the presale now and position yourself at the forefront of DeFi’s next breakout star.

That’s exactly what’s happening now with Bitcoin , XRP , Ethereum , and the fast-rising MAGACOINFINANCE.COM . As larger players reinforce their foundations, emerging names like MAGACOINFINANCE are grabbing attention for offering something even more valuable: early entry with major upside potential still ahead. MAGACOINFINANCE Is Quietly Building Toward Its Breakout Moment It’s the quiet momentum phases that often produce the biggest breakouts. MAGACOINFINANCE is in that phase right now—building wallet adoption, expanding its community organically, and delivering consistently against its roadmap. The early signs are undeniable: real traction without artificial hype. Growth that’s based on adoption, not flash marketing. Strategic moves that align with the best early-stage success stories in crypto history. This isn’t a project designed to spike and fade. MAGACOINFINANCE is positioning for endurance—and those moving now are positioning ahead of the inevitable next wave. The Pillars: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP Are Strengthening Foundations Bitcoin continues to act as the ultimate store of value in the crypto ecosystem. Its increasing acceptance among institutional investors and traditional finance giants makes its foundation stronger than ever. Every dip, every correction, has only strengthened Bitcoin’s long-term narrative. Ethereum remains the lifeblood of smart contract development. With Layer-2 solutions expanding and new upgrades optimizing scalability and security, Ethereum’s long-term dominance looks all but certain. XRP is leveraging regulatory victories and growing partnerships with major financial players. As global payment systems continue to evolve, XRP’s technology is positioned to capture significant transaction volume across borders. These names will always be relevant—but early-stage asymmetric opportunities like MAGACOINFINANCE are where aggressive growth potential still thrives. Strengthening Forces: Optimism, Aptos, and Chainlink Optimism has solidified its role as a critical scaling solution for Ethereum, driving faster, cheaper transactions for a new wave of decentralized applications. Aptos continues to show strength among newer Layer-1 platforms, appealing to developers looking for security, speed, and user-focused blockchain architecture. Chainlink remains the dominant force in blockchain oracles. With real-world integrations expanding rapidly, its importance to decentralized applications across sectors keeps growing. While these platforms are building steadily, MAGACOINFINANCE remains the one with pure early-stage discovery momentum—and that’s where true breakout opportunities often live. Final Word Is a $1.3 million path truly unfolding? Crypto history has shown that the combination of consolidation among giants and early-stage momentum among newcomers can lead to life-changing results. Bitcoin , Ethereum , and XRP are reinforcing their dominance. But MAGACOINFINANCE.COM is carving out a fresh lane—and those paying attention today could be the ones holding tomorrow’s headlines.

According to the online pundit, the flagship cryptocurrency could be on its way to as high as $131,800 so long as it stays above a critical support level. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sees Highest Exchange Outflows In 2 Years, What This Means For Price This projection is based on the Short-Term Holder (STH) Cost Basis, which measures the average price at which recent investors — typically defined as wallets holding Bitcoin for less than 155 days — acquired their coins. This metric often offers insight into the sentiment of short-term investors and can act as a relevant psychological support or resistance level. When the Bitcoin price is above the STH Cost Basis, it typically signals bullish momentum among short-term market participants. On the other hand, a sustained break beneath this metric could trigger increased selling pressure, as short-term holders are known for their speculative and reactive nature. According to data from Glassnode, the Short-Term Holder Cost Basis currently stands around $93,145, which represents a crucial support level for the Bitcoin price. Martinez noted that the premier cryptocurrency needs to hold above this support to make a run to a new all-time high price of $131,800. However, Martinez warned that if the Bitcoin price fails to defend the $93,145 support cushion, this could open the door to a broader correction. In this case, the market leader may suffer a deep price pullback toward the next major support level around $71,150 — an almost 25% decline from the current price point. As of this writing, the price of Bitcoin stands around $94,410, reflecting a 0.6% decline in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the premier cryptocurrency is up by more than 10% on the weekly timeframe. Could BTC Whales Provide The Needed Bullish Impetus? In a separate post on X, Martinez revealed that the Bitcoin whales have been getting busy in the market, loading up their bags following the recent price rally. Whales are significant market participants due to their substantial holdings and also their often informed trading decisions and positions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Perpetual Swaps Signal Short Bias Amid Price Rebound – Details Data from Santiment shows that Bitcoin whales (holding between 1,000 – 10,000 coins) bought over 20,000 BTC in the last 48 hours. With this increased buying activity from large investors, the Bitcoin price might get the needed momentum to attempt a run at a new all-time high.

Dogecoin, the granddaddy of all meme coins, just smashed a major resistance trendline, stirring up serious chatter about a breakout above $1. Meanwhile, the world of politics and memes is colliding in ways nobody could have imagined. A U.S. Senator is literally calling for Trump’s impeachment because he had a private dinner with top holders of meme coins. In 2025, meme coins aren’t just internet jokes anymore – they’re becoming power players in finance and politics. As the market heats up, it’s the perfect moment to dive into some of the most exciting meme coins making waves right now. Meme Coins Are Back in the Spotlight Dogecoin’s recent move could be the start of something massive. According to fresh reports, $DOGE has finally broken a long-standing resistance trendline, a signal many traders see as a green light for a major rally. If momentum holds, Dogecoin might actually smash through the $1 barrier for the first time – a milestone that’s been meme’d into legend. And it’s not just $DOGE. The entire meme coin sector is getting pulled higher. Just look at the charts: $TRUMP is surging after political headlines, $BONK and $WIF are pumping hard, and $BRETT is gaining traction too. Over on the political side, the meme economy got a huge PR boost when reports surfaced that Donald Trump hosted a dinner with major meme coin holders. The backlash was so intense that Senator Jon Ossoff is now demanding his impeachment . In short: memes have officially gone mainstream, and the market is loving it. 1. Mind of Pepe ($MIND) – The Meme Coin With a Brain First up is Mind of Pepe ($MIND) – a project that’s not just playing around with memes but redefining what a meme coin can be. $MIND is the first major meme coin brand powered by an advanced, self-sovereign AI agent . This isn’t just marketing fluff. Mind of Pepe’s AI will have its own autonomous account on X, scanning the crypto world using hive-mind analysis to spot trends before they explode. By interacting with influencers, sparking conversations, and shaping narratives, the AI builds real social clout – and $MIND holders are the ones who benefit. Only holders of $MIND will have access to exclusive, token-gated community channels where the AI drops alpha and early trend insights. It’s priced at just $0.0037415 and has already raised an eye-popping $8.3M in its presale. According to recent forecasts , $MIND could reach as high as $0.00535 in 2025, $0.0065 in 2026, and climb to $0.035 by 2030 if growth continues. But it doesn’t stop there. Mind of Pepe can also interact directly with blockchain dApps, manage its own wallet, and even launch new tokens, giving $MIND holders first access to opportunities. Plus, staking rewards are only available for $MIND presale buyers , offering even more upside. If you’re searching for the best altcoins blending meme culture with bleeding-edge tech, Mind of Pepe belongs at the top of your list. 2. Fantasy Pepe ($FEPE) – Where AI Football and Memes Collide Next is Fantasy Pepe ($FEPE) – a project that mixes the world’s favorite sport with the internet’s favorite meme in a wild AI-powered football league. In Fantasy Pepe, AI bots like ChatGPT and DeepSeek manage cryptofied football teams like Doge FC and Pepe United, while Grok acts as the on-chain referee, calling plays in real-time. Your job is simple: predict which AI-coached team will win and earn $FEPE rewards if you’re right. Matches last only 60 seconds, making the game fast, chaotic, and wildly addictive. The platform is built entirely on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring matches, predictions, and payouts are tamper-proof and transparent. Beyond predictions, players can collect limited-edition NFTs of star meme players and stake their $FEPE for massive APYs currently soaring above 1,385%. Priced at just $0.000307 with over $227K raised during its presale, Fantasy Pepe isn’t just another new crypto project – it’s bringing real play-to-earn excitement back to meme coins. With partnerships with real-world football clubs and major AI adoption underway, Fantasy Pepe could be the bridge between memes, sports, and crypto that the Web3 world has been waiting for. 3. Official Trump ($TRUMP) – Politics, Memes, and Moonshots Finally, we have Official Trump ($TRUMP) – a meme coin that perfectly captures the madness of politics crossing into crypto. Following a private dinner with meme coin holders, Donald Trump found himself at the center of a political storm, with a U.S. senator even calling for his impeachment. Meanwhile, $TRUMP itself exploded in value, surging 85% and crashing into the top 50 meme coins . Today, it trades around $14.78, holding a massive market cap and plenty of media attention. But Official Trump isn’t just riding controversy. The token has smartly tapped into Trump’s loyal base and meme culture to build an entire movement. Top $TRUMP holders are promised exclusive perks like private dinners, VIP receptions, and even a White House tour – a move that has only added to the buzz. Behind the scenes, entities linked to Trump control a large chunk of the supply, raising eyebrows but also fueling intrigue. Whether you see it as marketing genius or chaos incarnate, $TRUMP is the ultimate play for those betting on the unstoppable force of memes, controversy, and political drama. Meme Season Is Officially Back The meme coin market has come roaring back to life, fueled by breakouts, fresh projects, and even political drama. $DOGE is on the verge of history, new contenders like $MIND and $FEPE are building real ecosystems, and the buzz around $TRUMP proves that memes still hold massive power. If you’ve been sitting on the sidelines, this could be the perfect time to dive back in and catch the next wave. But remember to always do your own research (DYOR) before investing in crypto.

Strongly believe Bitcoin will reach $180k to $200k in 2025.” Five days later, BTC was trading above $93,600. BITCOIN is $84k today. Strongly believe Bitcoin will reach $180k to $200k in 2025. What do you think? — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 20, 2025 Earlier, on Apr. 18, the “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” author predicted that Bitcoin’s price will eventually skyrocket to $1 million. His related price predictions spelled doom for the dollar’s buying power: “I strongly believe, by 2035, that one Bitcoin will be over $ 1 million dollars. Gold will be $30k and silver $3,000 a coin.” “People who heeded my warnings are doing well today. I am concerned for those who did not,” wrote Kiyosaki in the long-form X update. He warned, “This coming Great Depression will cause millions to be poor… and a few who take action may enjoy great wealth and freedom.” Dire Economic Straits and Enterprising Bitcoin Investors Kiyosaki isn’t a contrarian voice to warn of a difficult economic downturn ahead. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned in April that the US could soon be mired in a stagflationary period of low growth and rising prices. Kiyosaki is also not the only financial expert who has predicted that Bitcoin’s price will reach $1 million. In fact, his timeframe for it is conservative compared to Twitter founder Jack Dorsey’s, who predicted a $1 million BTC price by 2030 in May last year . But, Kiyosaki is firmly in the high-conviction column for Bitcoin’s potential upside prices five and ten years from now. Here’s how some of his classic investment advice applies to BTC. 1. Kiyosaki on Income vs. Wealth “The rich focus on their asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements.” In his New York Times bestseller on personal finances and building wealth, Kiyosaki makes an important distinction between wealth and income. He points out that income takes most of your time and effort to sustain, but that wealth sustains your income automatically. This means even high-income individuals can struggle under equally big spending routines and borrow money at substantial interest rates to maintain a certain way of living. Thus, not long ago, PYMNTS and the Lending Club found in a survey that about 50% of Americans with six-figure incomes may be living paycheck to paycheck. In April, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said that late credit card payments and minimum payments are at the highest level since 2012. Individuals and households with these spending routines are swimming in the opposite direction of the macro financial currents of the past ten years, as the voracious Bitcoin hoarders . Managing finances this way is bargaining a harder tomorrow for an easier today. But the way frugal and thrifty saver/investors budget is bargaining a harder today for an easier tomorrow. 2. ‘Rich Dad, Poor Dad’ on Investing “You must know the difference between an asset and a liability and buy assets. An asset puts money in your pocket. A liability takes money out of your pocket.” Kiyosaki also discerns between assets and liabilities in an individual or household’s financial balance book. In his opinion, houses should not be considered assets because they cost money to maintain and finance. During the US housing market boom that preceded the 2008 financial crisis and the great recession, conventional financial wisdom said to buy a house because its value would continue going up forever. But starting in 2007, a mass wave of defaults and foreclosures crashed house prices. Bitcoin launched soon after that to create a space in the financial ecosystem based on settlement instead of lending. Instead of paying future obligations to consume more today, as with housing loans, Bitcoin is like collecting future rewards by consuming more efficiently today and buying BTC with the savings. If it continues to appreciate in value due to its scarcity and global popular demand, it will remain an asset rather than a liability like a mortgage, credit card balance, or college loan. 3. Bitcoin and Financial Literacy “Illiteracy, both in words and numbers, is the foundation of financial struggle.” Another key point of Kiyosaki’s message in “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” was that families, schools, and the government have mostly failed to educate Americans about the basics of finance and investing. He says that many people don’t really understand the disadvantages of borrowing money and paying interest instead of saving money and collecting returns on investments. That kind of bad financial math doesn’t just keep many Americans out of investing in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. It keeps them from saving any money using any method. Last December, a Schroders US retirement survey found that half of Gen Xers, Americans aged 44 to 59, have not done any retirement planning at all. In the cryptocurrency social media community, users like to post, “Do your own research.” Bitcoin aficionados especially like to post, “Do the math.” One benefit of learning about investing and doing financial math is that it can help to counteract the often more convincing pull of immediate gratification and result in healthier financial behavior. 4. Household Finance, Consumer Debt, and Bitcoin “A person can be highly educated, professionally successful, and financially illiterate. Many financial problems are caused by trying to keep up with the Joneses.” In fact, the main thrust of Kiyosaki’s book is that he found it remarkable in the course of his life’s experiences, how blatantly neglected financial and investment thinking is among even people of high intelligence, career success, and social status. The basics of accounting, budgeting, investing, and tax law are not learned or practiced by a shocking swath of the populace, he contends, despite the importance of these modalities to beneficial outcomes that people desire. If most people cannot be bothered to devote two to three hours a week to learning and eventually mastering these reliably rewarding and basic areas of competency, then it’s no mystery why Bitcoin remains inaccessible to many because it sits well enough beyond their threshold for healthy curiosity.

This cryptocurrency-tied derivative product will be launched on May 19 after necessary regulatory approvals. It’s also worth noting that CME successfully launched Solana futures last month. Ever since the appointment of Donald Trump as the president, there has been an increase in derivative offerings tied to cryptocurrencies. Keep reading to learn more about the growing trend of crypto trading products and which is the best crypto to buy now to make the most of this unique opportunity. The Trend of Crypto Products CME has seen tremendous growth in derivative trading during the first quarter of 2025. The company reported an average daily volume of 198K crypto contracts with a notional value of around $11.3B. A large part of this volume consisted of micro Ether features and micro Bitcoin futures. CME now wants to double down on this demand through its new XRP derivative product. XRP has also shown stability during the past two months. Although it tested its support at $1.73 during the first week of April, it did not breach it. Since then, it has shown a steady increase of 33% and is currently trading at $2.168 . Increasing Confidence in Bitcoin Bitcoin has also started showing signs of strength since last week. For the first time in seven weeks, it breached the $95K level and has been able to hold it since. $BTC is now trading around $94K , preparing to reclaim its high. The king crypto is showing a picture-perfect bounce from the 50% Fibonacci level , which is also a major support zone. What’s more, the price is now above the 50, 20, and 10 EMAs, showing massive bullish momentum. Plus, there’s a huge pile of crypto-pegged ETF applications pending with the SEC. Ever since the first Bitcoin ETF was approved in January 2025, the SEC has seen applications for Solana ETFs, Litecoin ETFs, XRP ETFs, and more. Trump also announced the formation of a US Bitcoin reserve, which triggered a global race among countries to hoard the asset. These macro- and microeconomic factors are surely a big positive for the crypto market as a whole. A favorable administration will ease out the regulations around crypto and help it become mainstream in the next few years. All this means that this is the right time to invest in crypto. To help you get started, here are three of the best altcoins right now. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Crypto to Buy In 2025 BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is probably the best crypto to invest in if you want to maximize your earnings from the upcoming Bitcoin (and crypto) bull run. That’s because it’s the ONLY crypto to offer free (and real) $BTC airdrops to its token holders. The airdrops will take place every time Bitcoin reaches a new landmark number, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. So, if you believe in Bitcoin’s lofty price predictions, you’d want to hold onto your $BTCBULL tokens – and remember to store them in Best Wallet to be eligible for free $BTC. We read through BTC Bull Token’s whitepaper and found that the developers have decided upon a deflationary approach, which, too, is based on Bitcoin’s price. Every time $BTC rises by $25K (so $125K, $150K, $175K, and so on), a part of the total supply of $BTCBULL tokens will be wiped off. Because there will be fewer tokens in circulation, especially if Bitcoin climbs quickly, it will crank up $BTCBULL’s demand and, therefore, its price. The best part is that you can grab this one-of-a-kind Bitcoin-themed altcoin for just $0.00248. That’s because the project is in presale, where it has so far raised over $5M. Here’s how to buy $BTCBULL . 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Top New Altcoin Revolutionizing the Solana Blockchain Solaxy ($SOLX) is right at the heart of Solana’s potentially bright future. After all, this new cryptocurrency is going to build the first-ever Layer 2 scaling solution on the network. Albeit successful, the launch of $TRUMP and $MELANIA earlier this year overloaded Solana. As a result, the blockchain has been struggling to process transactions in a timely fashion. There’s congestion on the network and, of course, scalability issues. However, with Solaxy being a multi-chain token, it will blend Solana’s high speed and low fees with Ethereum’s vast liquidity pool. Solaxy’s main plan of action, though, is offloading a bunch of transactions from Solana’s mainnet onto a sidechain to reduce the burden on the network as a whole. Furthermore, Solaxy will also process its share of the transactions in batches – rather than one by one. This will further improve Solana’s affordability.

The incident occurred on April 26 , when a hacker drained 5.7 million USDC and 1,200 SOL by executing a series of undercollateralized loans, according to Loopscale co-founder Mary Gooneratne. In response, Loopscale has partially restored platform functions, allowing users to repay loans, add collateral, and close existing loops. However, key features, including vault withdrawals, remain disabled as the team continues its investigation. Loopscale Exploit Hits USDC and SOL Vaults Gooneratne confirmed that the exploit was limited to the protocol’s USDC and SOL vaults, representing about 12% of Loopscale’s total value locked (TVL). “Our team is fully mobilized to investigate, recover funds, and ensure users are protected,” Gooneratne stated on X. Update: Loopscale has re-enabled loan repayments, top-ups, and loop closing. All other app functions (including Vault withdrawals) are still temporarily restricted while we investigate and ensure mitigation of this exploit. The root cause of the exploit has been identified as an… https://t.co/Pk2pMx8UcK — Loopscale (@LoopscaleLabs) April 26, 2025 The attack adds to a growing list of crypto exploits in 2025. Blockchain security firm PeckShield recently reported over $1.6 billion in crypto thefts during Q1 alone, with the majority linked to a $1.5 billion hack on centralized exchange ByBit by North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Launched publicly on April 10 after a six-month beta, Loopscale introduced a unique DeFi lending model aimed at improving capital efficiency. Unlike protocols such as Aave, which rely on pooled liquidity, Loopscale uses an order book system to directly match lenders and borrowers. It also offers specialized markets for structured credit, receivables financing, and undercollateralized loans. Before the exploit, Loopscale managed around $40 million in TVL and had attracted over 7,000 lenders. Its USDC and SOL vaults were offering attractive yields of over 5% and 10% APR, respectively. The platform also supported lending for tokens like JitoSOL and BONK, along with looping strategies across 40 token pairs. Investigations into the breach remain ongoing. Crypto Lost $1.6 Billion to Hacks in Q1 In the first three months of 2025, the crypto ecosystem lost a whopping $1,635,933,800 across 39 incidents, according to the blockchain security platform Immunefi . The report claimed, “Q1 2025 marks the worst quarter for hacks in the history of the crypto ecosystem.” Most of that was the result of only two hacks of two centralized exchanges. Phemex suffered a $69.1 million loss in January, while Bybit lost $1.46 billion in February. Subsequently, the total number of losses in the first quarter marks a 4.7x increase compared to Q1 2024 . At that time, hackers and fraudsters stole $348,251,217. Notably, experts assume that the infamous North Korean Lazarus Group is behind the two largest attacks. They stole $1.52 billion, which is 94% of total losses.

With the leading cryptocurrency pausing, attention shifts to Stacks and SUI . The article explores whether these emerging coins have the potential to rise independently in the current market landscape. Stacks Market Snapshot: Rally Amid Long-Term Volatility Stacks recorded a significant weekly jump of 47.01% and a 24.19% rise over the last month, while the six-month performance fell by 48.81%. The recent price surge contrasts sharply with the long-term decline, indicating changes in market sentiment and a recovery from previous lows. Current prices range from $0.47 to $0.82, with immediate support at $0.33 and resistance at $1.03; a secondary resistance sits at $1.38. Bulls have propelled prices up, yet an RSI of 72.20 suggests potential overbought conditions. Trading within these levels may present opportunities for short-term gains while remaining aware of the ongoing long-term pressures. SUI Price Surge: Past Gains and Current Levels SUI recorded a 30.06% increase over the past month and a remarkable 104.31% jump in the last six months. Price movements have shown both rapid weekly gains of 68.25% and overall volatility that underscores shifting investor sentiment. The coin has undergone significant growth while experiencing intermittent pullbacks, indicating an environment full of potential opportunities and challenges. SUI trades between $1.74 and $3.03, with immediate resistance at $3.78 and a second hurdle at $5.07, while support is established around $1.21. Technical indicators, including a high RSI of 77.95, suggest short-term bullish momentum but show signs of overextension. A careful approach focused on buying near support and selling around resistance may prove effective. Conclusion As Bitcoin's rally halts at $95k, attention shifts to Stacks (STX) and SUI . Both have shown resilience and potential for independent growth. STX's unique approach to integrating with existing networks offers a new way forward. SUI's features appeal to users seeking innovative solutions. The question remains whether these two can maintain their momentum. Their success may depend on how effectively they address current market needs and standing out in a crowded field. These factors will determine if they can thrive without Bitcoin's influence.

Litecoin (LTC) holds strong as a lightweight, battle-tested payment solution. These assets maintain strength—but none of them are still offering the undiscovered early-mover advantage that MAGACOINFINANCE provides right now. Final Word The next major crypto cycle won’t just reward holding established names—it will reward those who move early on the next big opportunities.

Krueger summarized his observations using the Quantile Model, which shows that Bitcoin is likely to reach the 95% quantile region. If this milestone is reached in 2025, he expects Bitcoin to reach around $250,000. If the cycle extends to 2026, he believes the price could climb to $300,000. Krueger predicts a significant pullback after the peak, predicting that Bitcoin could drop into the “Yellow zone” around $150,000. He claimed that the optimal point for users to start reducing their positions would be $200,000. On the other hand, Bitcoin is traded at $94,000, according to data from Binance TR. Related News: Will History Repeat Itself in Bitcoin (BTC)? Expert Analysts Give Their Predictions In his analysis, Krueger argued against applying Metcalfe’s Law, which ties network value to the square of the number of users, to Bitcoin. Instead, he argued that Bitcoin’s growth was not due to traditional network effects seen on platforms like Facebook or blockchains like Solana, but rather to growing belief among investors. He likened Bitcoin’s behavior to gold, stating that Bitcoin is a monetary good, a digital store of value, and a hedge against fiat currency depreciation. In response to a follower who claimed that Bitcoin could fall to $80,000 by 2026, Krueger acknowledged the possibility, pointing to broader macroeconomic and political implications, adding that it could happen as soon as 2027, even if Trump “loses the midterm elections.” *This is not investment advice.

However, this might change soon. Well-known crypto expert Dr. Altcoin predicts that Pi Coin’s rally could begin during the highly anticipated Consensus Summit starting from 14 May 2025. Pi Price Rally To Come At Consensus Summit In his latest X post, Dr Altcoin said he feels pretty confident that the Pi price pump could actually begin during the highly anticipated Consensus Summit, which is happening from May 14 to May 16, 2025 . This global blockchain event brings together the biggest names in crypto, offering Pi a perfect stage to shine. He believes that even small positive news like new partnerships, major updates, or ecosystem growth announced during this event could create a rush of excitement. Thus, if Pi Network gets the right attention, it could lead to a major price rally even before August. Pi Unlocking to Easy After August Although, this comes as a surprise for many because earlier expectations were tied to the end of August, a time when a large amount of Pi coins would finish unlocking, creating less selling pressure. According to the Piscan , the beginning of August will see the release of Pi tokens drop by almost half. In August, only $132.5 million worth of Pi tokens will be released. September will see $115.2 million, October $89.5 million, and November $85.9 million. Pi Coin Price Outlook As of now, Pi Network coin is trading at $0.63, reflecting a drop of 1.3% seen in the last 24 hours. The coin has been consolidating recently, trading between resistance at $0.68 and support at $0.61. If the price breaks above $0.68, it could mark the beginning of a fresh rally. The next resistance levels to watch would be $0.789 and $0.85.

Binance Coin ( BNB ) traded at the psychological level of $600 on Sunday, slightly below this month’s high of $630 and 15% above its lowest point this month. The main catalyst for the BNB price will be the Lorentz upgrade, which will happen on April 29. This is one of the three upgrades of the year. Its goal will be to make BSC one of the fastest chains in the crypto industry. The Lorentz upgrade will reduce the block time from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds. The goal is to cut latency and accelerate transaction confirmations. Faster speeds will also enhance the responsiveness of decentralized applications on the network. You might also like: Ethereum price eyes $2,000 as spot ETH ETFs buck worrying trend The BSC developers will continue building after the Lorentz upgrade as they seek to launch the Maxwell upgrade in June. Like Lorentz, Maxwell hopes to supercharge the network’s transaction speed by reducing block times to 0.75 seconds. BSC builders hope to catch up with Solana ( SOL ) over time. Due to its combination of proof-of-stake and proof-of-history, Solana now has block times of approximately 0.4 seconds. Ethereum ( ETH ), on the other hand, has block times of 12 seconds, making it a slower chain than its biggest competitors. The Lorentz upgrade comes after the developers launched the Pascal hard fork, which increased Ethereum’s integration, introduced gasless transactions, and enhanced security. BSC developers hope the network will be the most viable alternative to Solana and Ethereum. Solana has become the home of meme coins, while Ethereum is known for its slow speeds and high transaction costs. BNB price technical analysis BNB price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the BNB price formed a triple-bottom pattern between $507 and $520. These levels formed the lower side of the descending triangle pattern, a popular bearish continuation sign. The coin now sits on the upper side of the triangle pattern and is consolidating at the 100-day and 50-day moving averages. Therefore, the outlook is neutral for now. More gains will be confirmed if the coin rises above $620, the highest point this month. This move will see it jump to the next resistance at $720, its highest level in June last year. The alternative scenario is for the Binance Coin price to drop and retest the lower side of the descending triangle pattern at $507.
