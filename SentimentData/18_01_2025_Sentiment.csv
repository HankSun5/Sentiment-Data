Whales Purchase Over $1 Billion in ETH appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The overall cryptocurrency market has shown strong bullish potential ahead of President-elect and pro-crypto advocate Donald Trump’s inauguration, scheduled for January 20, 2025. However, one thing that has been capturing the massive attention of crypto enthusiasts is the recent activity of crypto giants over the past week. Whales Purchase Over $1 Billion in ETH Recently, a prominent crypto expert posted on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that whales have purchased over a billion dollars worth of Ethereum (ETH) in the past week. The expert stated that more than 330,000 ETH, valued at over $1 billion, has been acquired by these crypto whales. Whales have accumulated over 330,000 #Ethereum $ETH in the past week, valued at more than $1 billion! pic.twitter.com/aNuP9HFwEh — Ali (@ali_charts) January 17, 2025 This large accumulation of ETH by whales suggests a strategic move to capitalize on Trump’s inauguration, which is expected to have a positive impact on the crypto market. However, experts and analysts are already speculating that the crypto market could experience a significant surge following the inauguration day. In the meantime, there is also a possibility of profit booking as the market has been rising over the past few days. However, only time will tell where the market will head after this upcoming political event. Current Price Momentum and Rising Participation Currently, ETH has crossed the $3,500 mark and is trading near $3,515. It has experienced a price surge of over 5.5% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, it has attracted significant traders and investors, resulting in an 11% jump in trading volume. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action and Key Levels With the impressive price surge, ETH has once again reached the crucial resistance level of $3,500, where it previously experienced a price reversal. According to expert technical analysis, if ETH breaches this resistance level and closes a daily candle above $3,550, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 15% to reach the $4,100 mark in the coming days.

Wyoming took its first bold step toward a strategic bitcoin reserve! Thank you Rep. Wasserburger for introducing legislation to allow permanent funds to diversify into Bitcoin. This forward-thinking approach will benefit our state as we lead the nation in financial innovation! — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) January 17, 2025 Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the first to highlight the proposal, emphasized its potential benefits to the state’s financial strategy. “This forward-thinking approach will benefit our state as we lead the nation in financial innovation,” Lummis remarked . Wyoming’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Proposal: Will It Inspire Others? As states explore the potential of integrating Bitcoin into public financial strategies, Wyoming’s latest proposal sets a precedent that could influence others, including Massachusetts. According to Wasserburger, the bill’s sponsor, the proposal aligns with Wyoming’s history of pioneering firsts. “Wyoming has always been a pioneer—from women’s suffrage to the first national park; from the invention of the LLC to the frontier of digital assets.,” Wasserburger said. Source: wyoleg.gov HB0201 authorizes the state treasurer to invest portions of Wyoming’s general fund, permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund, and permanent land fund in Bitcoin, with investments capped at 3% of these funds to balance potential gains with prudent risk management. To address security concerns, the bill requires robust custody solutions for Bitcoin holdings, emphasizing the protection of private keys and adherence to strict security standards. The proposal leverages Wyoming’s comprehensive legislative framework, including the Wyoming Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) model, which has gained widespread recognition in the digital asset space. Since 2018, Wyoming has established itself as a pioneer in Bitcoin-friendly legislation, passing more than two dozen laws supporting digital assets. These initiatives include recognizing Bitcoin as property and providing regulatory clarity for blockchain companies, solidifying the state’s reputation as a hub for digital innovation. Alongside Wyoming, Massachusetts has also proposed a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Source: Bitcoin Magazine / X State Senator Peter Durant, who filed the bill, expressed enthusiasm about advancing legislation that could shape the state’s financial future. Excited to get to work on this legislation! https://t.co/zT6W3JeGZh — State Senator Peter Durant (@senpeterdurant) January 17, 2025 The Economic Case for a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bitcoin , often referred to as “digital gold,” has demonstrated substantial appreciation and resilience over the past decade. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply align with principles of fiscal independence and economic stability. As a result, many institutions, companies, and countries have begun incorporating Bitcoin into their investment portfolios. Wasserburger emphasized the urgency of adopting such measures, stating, “We can’t afford to sit on the sidelines while other states move forward with their own Bitcoin reserve bills.” Establishing a Bitcoin reserve could help Wyoming mitigate risks associated with inflation and economic volatility while ensuring long-term financial security for its citizens. The proposal also aligns with Senator Cynthia Lummis’ advocacy for a United States Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Lummis’ 2024 draft of the Bitcoin Act, which proposed creating a federal Bitcoin reserve to reinforce America’s financial standing, has laid the groundwork for current legislative efforts. Elsewhere, momentum for Bitcoin reserves continues to grow. On January 16, Texas Senator Charles Schwertner filed Senate Bill 778 (SB 778) to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Internationally, the Czech Republic’s central bank is also exploring Bitcoin as a reserve asset , as governments and institutions continue to evaluate the digital asset’s potential.

The crypto exchange’s update follows a joint statement from the U.S., Japan, and South Korea that was published this week. The statement attributed the attacks to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, or North Korea), including the infamous Lazarus Group. According to the firm, the freezing was the first significant step in a long and intricate recovery procedure that involved numerous jurisdictions and court cases. WazirX initiates recovery efforts after losing $230 million WazirX’s July 2024 resulted in the loss of nearly 45% of the platform’s total cryptocurrency assets, or more than $230 million. The firm’s hack ranks third among the largest crypto hacks and exploits recorded in 2024, following PlayDapp’s $290 million and DMM Bitcoin’s $308 million in losses. The attack that wiped out most of the platform’s assets left WazirX with more than $546.5 million in liabilities. Multiple layers of security, including six signatories and whitelisted destination addresses, protected the compromised wallet, which relied on Liminal’s digital asset custody infrastructure. However, the hackers took advantage of a significant flaw, a difference between the data shown on Liminal’s interface and the real transaction details. The scammers could reverse-engineer the system and take control of the wallet. After the incident, WazirX parted ways with Liminal Custody. In August 2024, the company has since followed up with a restructuring filing with a Singapore court. WazirX, an exchange founded and currently owned by Zettai in Singapore, has been working with lawyers, forensic experts, and the police to try to recover the stolen funds. WazirX vows to resume trading by February 2025 In November 2024, cofounder Nischal Shetty assured users at a town hall meeting that recovery was underway and said trading could reopen in February 2025. Freezing some of the swiped stablecoins presents a breakthrough event to regain confidence and pay off affected users. Earlier U.N. reports estimated that North Korea stole $3 billion in crypto between 2017 and 2023 to fund its sanctioned nuclear weapons programs. Recent data from Chainalysis showed North Korean hackers were responsible for 61% of all cryptocurrency stolen in 2024, totaling $1.34 billion.

When a company files in such a manner, it means that it has submitted its initial registration statement with the SEC but is yet to make it public. This initial filing will help it gather feedback from the agency and make necessary adjustments before officially announcing its IPO plans. eToro to Go Public in New York According to a report by the Financial Times, which cited people with knowledge of the matter, the Israeli-based crypto and stock trading platform could go public in New York as early as Q2 2025—if successful. It targets a valuation of $5 billion, up from a $3.5 billion market cap in 2023. The report revealed that eToro has partnered with Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and UBS to carry out its plans. This means that these investment banks will guide eToro through the IPO process. Not the First This is not the first time eToro has attempted to go public in the US. In 2021, it entered a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) deal with FinTech Acquisition Corp. V. at a valuation of $10.4 billion. However, the plan fell through due to the bear market of 2022. The SEC did not approve that plan. Multiple crypto-related companies have also attempted to go public through a SPAC deal but have been unsuccessful. In July 2021, USDC issuer Circle filed for an IPO with the SEC through a SPAC deal but later abandoned the plan because it did not meet the SEC’s qualifications at the time. This deal could have given Circle a $9 billion valuation. Crypto miner Prime Blockchain also canceled plans to go public through a SPAC deal in 2022. If successful, eToro will join crypto companies like Coinbase and Bakkt to go public in the US. Several Bitcoin miners, including Marathon Digital, are also listed in the US.

Based on CryptoQuant’s analysis, the surge suggests an increase in institutional investors utilizing OTC channels to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC). Institutional BTC Preference Triggers OTC Trading From the data provided by analysts at CryptoQuant, the spike in inflows resembles a similar trend seen on December 17. Noteworthy, that was the day that Bitcoin hit its all-time high (ATH) of over $108,000. According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, such a significant surge in inflows on the Coinbase platform usually indicates that multiple OTC trades are occurring. It also reflects institutions’ preferences to accumulate bitcoin through OTC trading. Julio Moreno, the head of research at CryptoQuant, highlighted that the inflows represent the BTC sourced from Coinbase for institutional clients. Furthermore, he noted that OTC flows recently reached $14 billion, equivalent to 142,000 Bitcoin on the American centralized exchange. Growing Institutional Adoption of BTC With Pro-crypto Government Generally, the digital asset landscape has registered some improvements in the months that followed the United States 2024 presidential elections. Republican politician Donald Trump, known for his pro-crypto stance, won the race , uplifting the ecosystem’s spirit. He is finally coming into power by January 20. One of the moves he intends to make today is ousting Gary Gensler, the current United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman. Former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins has been nominated to replace him. This move is expected to bring more favorable policies to the crypto industry. Bitcoin price will likely register more rally, to the point of oven hitting a new ATH. BTC Price Performance and Potential At this time, Bitcoin traded at $104,951.39, corresponding with a 5.58% increase within 24 hours. While this is a lofty price level, it is still significantly lower than the coin’s ATH of over $108,000. With several nations, including the US, vying to add the flagship cryptocurrency to their strategic reserve, BTC will likely register more gains. The potential growth in Bitcoin ETF inflows could also contribute to the price rally.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Exploring Cardano, Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and Remittix as standout cryptos for 2025. Table of Contents Cardano eyes RLUSD Solana ready for the next ETF surge XRP rides the bullish wave Dogecoin: Meme to payment option Remittix: The PayFi contender Remittix takes center stage Building a well-rounded crypto lineup for the future is on every investor’s mind. On that note, Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and the rising star Remittix have gained attention so far in 2025. Cardano eyes RLUSD Cardano recently made headlines when its founder Charles Hoskinson revealed talks to integrate Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD. The Cardano team sees RLUSD as a perfect fit to strengthen its stablecoin offerings, which already include tokens like USDM and Djed. If this integration works out, Cardano could boost its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, drawing more liquidity and user adoption. Investors still recall that Cardano’s ADA token hit a two-year high before volatile market conditions triggered a decline. Long-term holders believe that stablecoin collaborations could help ADA stabilize and even push it upward in 2025. Solana ready for the next ETF surge Solana currently trades at around $219, showing a 17% increase over the past seven days. Banking giants hint that a spot-based SOL exchange-traded fund could bring in billions in new investments. If approvals materialize in the coming months, Solana might see another massive climb, especially if Donald Trump’s administration leans more crypto-friendly. The Solana network’s main attraction is its high-speed transactions, perfect for NFTs and DeFi. However, critics note the occasional outages that undermine user trust. If Solana solves its downtime issues and secures an ETF listing, many experts think it might become the major DeFi powerhouse in 2025. You might also like: Remittix tipped for greater long-term growth than Shiba Inu and Dogecoin XRP rides the bullish wave The XRP price has surged over 40% in the last week and past 30 days. A court ruling clarified that XRP isn’t a security in secondary markets, fueling confidence. There’s also growing speculation that a spot-based XRP ETF could appear soon, with executives like Ripple President Monica Long feeling upbeat. While regulatory uncertainties hang overhead, optimism remains. Ripple aims to expand XRP’s use in remittances and corporate payments, and a bullish run could continue if ETFs or big partners jump on board. Dogecoin: Meme to payment option Priced around $0.41 dollars, Dogecoin is up 24.71% in the last week. Major whale moves have rattled watchers, but some interpret these big transactions as signs of renewed interest. Tesla’s decision to accept DOGE for select payments hints at mainstream acceptance. While Dogecoin has soared in the past on celebrity endorsements and community zeal, it needs lasting adoption to stay relevant. If its developers deliver more on the utility front, DOGE could maintain its standing as an iconic crypto. Nonetheless, some see it as a gateway token for newbies, which might keep the coin rising through 2025. You might also like: Solana, Sui investors flock to new viral altcoin Remittix Remittix: The PayFi contender Despite not being a legacy token, Remittix is attracting big buzz for its PayFi approach — mixing crypto innovation with traditional banking. In just three weeks, Remittix raised over $3 million in its presale, pushing the token price up from $0.0199 to $0.0207. Analysts suggest that Remittix could hit a 1-dollar milestone if enough users adopt it for cross-border payments. Unlike meme or purely DeFi tokens, Remittix focuses on everyday transactions. By enabling fast crypto-to-fiat settlements with zero hidden fees, Remittix appeals to businesses and individuals alike. Its Pay API will help merchants accept crypto payments, converting them to fiat in under 24 hours. Remittix takes center stage Cardano might soon integrate RLUSD, Solana could see an ETF windfall, XRP edges closer to regulatory clarification, and Dogecoin remains an entertaining fan favorite. However, Remittix is the big story — its PayFi model sets it apart as an easy-to-use altcoin for cross-border transactions. To learn more about Remittix, visit their website or social media channels.

Elon Bromance (ELOBRO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOBRO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Bromance by entering its contract address – FY7aYv7K3yEE9Z8hzgURj5z7biTE8Z6BpunBPAnCEpxj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOBRO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 22:33:00

However, since the company has a European regional headquarters in Paris, it is more probable that the approval was given by the French financial authorities. According to Eric Anziani, Crypto.com’s president and COO, MiCA is crucial because it helps build trust in the crypto sector. “We have always been fully supportive of MiCA and strongly believe it will bring clarity, transparency, and establish a more streamlined sentiment towards the regulation of our industry across the EU.” Eric Anziani In 2021, Crypto.com was also issued a Class 3 Virtual Financial Assets (VFA) License by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), which enabled it to place orders, offer custody services, and operate on its own account. The MFSA also granted the company in-principle approval of the Financial Institution License. Impact of MiCA on the crypto industry MiCA sets out comprehensive regulations for crypto assets, service providers, and jurisdictional governance. It is meant to harmonize operations while ensuring compliance with EU-wide standards. The framework also outlines a set of tough rules for stablecoins. Earlier this week, Dutch regulators granted MiCA licenses to four crypto companies, including MoonPay. Circle, the creator of USDC stablecoin and a cryptocurrency firm, also secured the EU’s inaugural MiCA greenlight last year. As a result, in July 2024, Circle became an e-money institution (EMI) in France, which allowed the company to function under the stringent EU regulation of cryptocurrencies. Boerse Stuttgart Digital has been among the earliest ones to secure a MiCA license in Germany. The license was issued by the German regulator BaFin and enables Boerse Stuttgart Digital to provide all of its services across the EU member states. MiCA could also set a precedent for regulating crypto outside of Europe. According to Cryptopolitan, it provides a unified framework that other nations may follow. Cryptopolitan further stated , “MiCA’s structured approach may influence global regulators, especially in the US, where enforcement often outweighs clear rulemaking.” The in-principle MiCA approval is part of Crypto.com’s larger plan to grow its footprint in the world. Launched in 2016, the exchange now has more than 100 million users. The firm has obtained licenses in key jurisdictions such as Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom.

The lawsuit names former CEO Gregory Becker, ex-CFO Daniel Beck, and 15 others. The FDIC, acting as SVB’s receiver, says the defendants ignored basic banking principles and internal risk policies. Instead, they allegedly chased profits and a higher stock price, exposing the bank to “catastrophic risks,” according to the court documents. Risky bets and a $294 million dividend At the heart of the FDIC’s allegations is a series of poor decisions tied to interest rates and liquidity management. Silicon Valley Bank was heavily reliant on long-term government bonds, including U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, which were sensitive to rising interest rates. When the Federal Reserve began hiking rates in response to inflation, these assets plummeted in value, slashing SVB’s ability to cover liabilities. The FDIC also criticized a “grossly imprudent” $294 million dividend payment made to SVB’s parent company in December 2022. By draining the bank’s capital just three months before its collapse, the payment left SVB vulnerable at a time when it desperately needed cash to stay afloat. Defendants fight back Lawyers for Laura Izurieta, SVB’s former Chief Risk Officer, pushed back hard against the allegations. Izurieta left the bank in April 2022, nearly a year before the meltdown. Her legal team called her inclusion in the suit “outrageous,” claiming she provided sound advice on risk management before her departure. Other defendants, including Becker, have not publicly commented, though Reuters reports that Becker’s legal team said he was traveling and unavailable. Silicon Valley Bank’s downfall began on March 8, 2023, when the bank announced it had sold $21 billion worth of securities at a staggering $1.8 billion loss. It also shared plans to raise $2.25 billion through a stock sale to cover the hole in its balance sheet. That announcement set off a chain reaction of panic. By March 9, venture capital firms and tech startups were withdrawing deposits at an alarming rate. Founders Fund, led by Peter Thiel, reportedly pulled all its deposits, and by the end of the day, SVB faced $42 billion in withdrawal requests—equal to a quarter of its total deposits. The bank ended the day with a negative cash balance of nearly $1 billion, making regulatory intervention inevitable. On March 10, regulators seized SVB. The collapse stunned Silicon Valley, as SVB had long been the go-to bank. Its demise also rattled financial markets including crypto, as an unusually high percentage of the bank’s deposits—over 90%—were uninsured. Aftermath and acquisition by First Citizens The FDIC claims it tried to act quickly and stabilize the situation, telling depositors that all funds, including those above the $250,000 insurance limit, would be accessible by March 13, 2023. But the damage was already done. And SVB’s collapse triggered a domino effect, with Signature Bank and First Republic Bank also going under in the weeks that followed. On March 26, North Carolina-based First Citizens BancShares stepped in to acquire most of SVB’s assets and deposits in a deal brokered by the FDIC. First Citizens took over tens of billions in loans but left $90 billion worth of securities under FDIC receivership. At the time of its collapse, SVB had $209 billion in assets, making it the 16th largest bank in the United States. Its failure now sits alongside infamous banking disasters like Washington Mutual’s 2008 collapse.

The allure of RCO Finance stems not only from its innovative features but also from the promise of massive returns, post-presale, drawing in investors who are looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto space. Cardano and Solana Struggle to Regain Momentum Cardano (ADA) has demonstrated resilience, with its price currently around $1.05, up 4% over the past week. This price gain comes amidst Cardano’s efforts to enhance its scalability through Hydra, its layer-2 scaling solution, which recently allowed it to process over 2 billion transactions in just four hours, surpassing Solana in transaction speed. This technological leap has sparked renewed investor interest, positioning Cardano as a strong contender in the DeFi space despite upcoming token unlocks that are expected to have minimal market impact. On the other hand, Solana has been on an upward trajectory, trading at approximately $189.22, despite a 4.2% decline over the past week. Over the year, it has seen a modest 99% price increase. This rise in SOL’s price can be attributed to growing speculation around a potential Solana ETF approval and substantial network activity, including the listing of new memecoins like ACT and PNUT on Binance. Additionally, Solana’s open interest has crossed $5 billion, reflecting a significant increase in capital inflows, which suggests robust market participation and confidence in its continued bullish momentum. However, Solana still faces challenges like network congestion, which it is actively working to resolve through technological updates like its v1.16 release, introducing features such as ‘confidential transfers’ for enhanced privacy. These developments have led investors from both Cardano and Solana ecosystems to explore new opportunities, with RCO Finance (RCOF) emerging as a cryptocurrency with potentially higher returns through its innovative use of AI and broad asset access. Investors Eye RCO Finance (RCOF) for Lucrative Returns The presale of RCO Finance’s native token, RCOF, has captured the attention of those looking to diversify from Cardano and Solana. Currently, in its fourth presale stage , the RCOF token’s price has surged by 509% to $0.07770 from its initial offering, signaling strong market interest. As the presale progresses to its final round, the price is expected to jump another 175% to $0.21420, offering early investors significant gains even before the token hits public exchanges. Upon listing, RCOF is projected to debut between $0.4 and $0.6, but the real excitement revolves around what happens post-launch. With the official rollout of the RCO Finance platform, the value of RCOF could soar by as much as 43,000%, offering early investors a chance to see their investments multiply immensely. This expectation is not just based on hype but on the robust features and utility that RCO Finance is set to introduce to the DeFi landscape. RCO Finance: Revolutionizing DeFi with AI and Accessibility RCO Finance stands out with its AI-powered Robo Advisor , which dynamically crafts investment strategies tailored to individual financial goals, risk profiles, and market conditions. This AI tool will analyze vast amounts of data in real time, adjusting portfolios to maximize returns, a feature that democratizes access to sophisticated financial strategies without the need for intermediaries. Moreover, RCO Finance will offer trading across over 120,000 assets, including tokenized real-world assets like real estate, which were previously out of reach for many retail investors. This wide asset selection supports diversification, which is key in managing investment risks. The platform shall also operate within a KYC-free ecosystem, focusing on user privacy and ease of access, allowing users to engage with DeFi without cumbersome identity verifications. Security is not compromised, as evidenced by the smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof, which ensures the integrity and safety of investments on the platform. The tokenomics of RCOF further enhances its appeal, with a significant portion of tokens allocated for public sale, ensuring community involvement in governance and decision-making. This model, combined with a deflationary mechanism where unsold tokens are burned, supportsthe long-term value appreciation of RCOF. Given these features, RCO Finance is poised to revolutionize how investments are made in the DeFi sector, potentially leading to a tremendous growth trajectory for its native token, RCOF. With its AI-driven platform, broad asset access, and commitment to privacy and security, RCO Finance could indeed witness an exponential surge in its token’s value, making it a focal point for Cardano and Solana traders looking for the next big move in cryptocurrency investment.

This impressive rebound has sparked renewed optimism among investors, who are now eyeing the potential for a bullish continuation in the weeks ahead. The rapid price increase has positioned Solana as one of the top-performing assets in the crypto market, signaling a potential shift in momentum. Related Reading: Ondo Finance Funding Rate Signals Greed Among Investors – Sign Of Strength? Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared a detailed technical analysis, highlighting that Solana has broken out of its prolonged downtrend. According to Jelle, SOL has successfully reclaimed crucial monthly and weekly support levels, indicating a significant move could be on the horizon. These levels, often considered key benchmarks for long-term stability, suggest that Solana’s recent gains may be more than just a temporary bounce. If Solana can sustain this momentum, it may not only recover from recent losses but also pave the way for further gains, potentially outperforming other major altcoins. As technical indicators align with market enthusiasm, Solana could be gearing up for a breakout rally that captures the spotlight. Solana Set To Enter Price Discovery Phase Solana (SOL) emerged as one of the top market performers in 2024, posting an impressive surge of over 170%. This stellar performance cemented its position as a market leader and highlighted its resilience and growth potential within the crypto space. As 2025 unfolds, optimism surrounding Solana remains high, with many investors anticipating significant gains in the coming months. The momentum appears to be building already, as Solana begins the year with a potential breakout. Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared insights on X, pointing out that SOL has successfully broken out of the downtrend that had restrained it since late November. Moreover, Solana has reclaimed both monthly and weekly support levels—crucial milestones indicating that the asset has regained its bullish footing. According to Jelle, the price action for Solana is “super clean,” suggesting that the cryptocurrency is well-positioned for higher valuations. Jelle’s initial target for SOL is set at $330, a level that would not only mark a significant recovery but could also push Solana into a price discovery phase. This phase typically sees heightened market interest and volatility as traders and investors recalibrate expectations for the asset’s long-term value. With technical indicators and market sentiment aligning, Solana appears poised to capitalize on its upward trajectory.

As anticipation builds for further upside, traders and investors are closely monitoring key levels, knowing that the cryptocurrency’s next big move could redefine its role in the broader crypto ecosystem. SOL Testing Crucial Supply Around $220 Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $218, approaching a critical level that could determine its next major move. The price is on the verge of setting a new local high above $222, a significant resistance point. Breaking through this level would signal a strong bullish continuation, setting the stage for massive price appreciation and the potential to reclaim its all-time high (ATH). Analysts believe that if SOL clears the $222 mark and maintains its momentum, the next key level to watch is $250. Reclaiming and holding $250 as support would pave the way for Solana to enter uncharted territory, pushing its price into a new all-time high and potentially beginning a price discovery phase. This development would further solidify Solana’s position as a market leader and attract increased investor attention.

Such a pause in price action might delay Solana’s rally but could also provide a foundation for renewed momentum in the future. With market participants closely monitoring these levels, Solana’s price movements in the coming days will be pivotal in determining whether the cryptocurrency embarks on its next major leg up or enters a temporary holding pattern.

The study, published in the International Journal of Bank Marketing, aimed to “investigate the associations between social media usage and cryptocurrency investment behavior.” “Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity among investors despite their high risk and volatility. Social media wields substantial influence over investors’ attitudes, judgments and decisions related to investment.” The study, conducted by researchers Kyoung Tae Kim and Lu Fan, claims to be one of the first of its kind. “This study is one of the initial attempts to examine the role of social media platforms in cryptocurrency investment. The findings offer unique and important theoretical and practical insights for policymakers, researchers and practitioners, which can benefit consumer well-being.” According to the researchers, the study concluded that social media users are more likely to invest in cryptocurrency. “Investors who used social media for investment information were more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies and consider investing in cryptocurrencies in the future. The likelihood increased with the number of social media platforms used. Different social media platforms exhibited distinct associations with cryptocurrency investment experiences and future considerations.” According to researcher Lu Fan , much of the chatter surrounding cryptocurrency originates from and echoes within social media. “A lot of people talk about cryptocurrency on social media and how popular it has become. There are a lot of celebrities talking about this. People are thinking, ‘Because my friends, families and the celebrities I admire all invest in that, maybe I should too.” Fan also highlights a link between youth, social media use, and crypto investments. “Our study showed that the younger adults are more likely to invest in crypto now, and they’re also the majority users of social media. So, when serving those young adults who usually need to gain more financial literacy through life experience and age, there needs to be some guidance as well.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Pepe’s price surges, attention is also shifting to Wall Street Pepe as its presale hits the $50 million mark. Table of Contents PEPE’s next move Wall Street Pepe could be the next PEPE Popular meme coin Pepe (PEPE) witnessed a 12% surge in the past 24 hours, pushing its price to $0.00002028. With a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $1.4 billion, the token is demonstrating significant market activity. The rally comes as the overall crypto market gains momentum, with PEPE securing the 23rd spot by market cap, which now stands at $8.53 billion. Meanwhile, the new frog meme coin Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) hit $50m in what looks to be one of this year’s hottest crypto presales. PEPE’s next move On the technical front, PEPE is trading above its 9-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $0.00001980 and its 9-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $0.00002002. These levels signal short-term bullish momentum as the token continues its recovery from recent lows. The Bollinger Bands indicate narrowing volatility, with the price testing the upper band of $0.00002020. This pattern suggests the potential for another breakout if the bullish sentiment persists. Key support for $PEPE stands at $0.00001950, the mid-point of the Bollinger Bands. A drop below this level could see the token retrace toward $0.00001860, potentially reversing the recent upward trend. On the upside, immediate resistance is at $0.00002060, the upper end of its 24-hour range. A breakout past this level could lead to testing the key psychological mark of $0.00002200. Investor confidence in PEPE remains high, as indicated by its robust volume and sharp price movement. If the current bullish momentum holds, $PEPE could be poised for another leg up, but failure to maintain support levels could signal a short-term correction.

Digesting the SEC chairman’s exit interview,https://crypto.news/gary-genslers-political-testament-exit-interview/,"On Jan. 14, 2025, Gary Gensler had a farewell interview on CNBC. On January 20, he will step down as the chairman of the SEC. What were their conclusive words to the crypto community? At the very start of the interview, the host, Andrew Ross Sorkin, makes a remark that sets the context. He notes that even in the last few days of Gensler’s tenure as the SEC chair and launch of the Trump administration 2.0, Robinhood brokers had to settle $45 million SEC charges associated with violations of ten law provisions. Read more: Robinhood hit with $45m SEC settlement over securities violations At that time, Sorkin didn’t know that after the interview, the SEC would rekindle the case against Ripple. Gary Gensler opens the Ripple case yet again. #BreakingNews #CryptoNews #NewsUpdate #Ripple #Trump #ElonMusk #XRPArmy pic.twitter.com/eSYGdkp1jH — Rexla (@RexlaGlobal) January 17, 2025 Sorkin’s smart tone-setting remark paints Gensler as a soldier relentlessly fighting to protect the prehistoric laws from the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Let’s see what Gary told the CNBC hosts over various topics during an exit interview. Trump 2.0 as pro-crypto administration Admitting that donors from the crypto field were prominent in sponsoring Trump’s campaign, Gensler noted that the election was not about cryptocurrencies. He mentioned that his predecessor, Jay Clayton, who will serve in the new Trump administration, brought up 80 cases during his past tenure. It seems that Gensler is hinting that the new administration is not going to tolerate lawbreakers, no matter how pro-crypto it is. Gensler’s epitome: cryptos are securities. Period Sorkin pointed out that Gensler, during his tenure, has been battling crypto companies, leaning on the existing laws while not working on creating the laws that would have factored the changing reality in. This question is really genuine as Gensler is known as a person who tends to equate most cryptocurrencies to unregistered securities, which is a very uncomfortable way to perceive crypto for crypto companies. Instead of pushing the new rules to efficiently regulate crypto, Gensler was trying to shove crypto into an already existing law configuration, no matter how inadequate it is for crypto. Mostly, these laws were not created with cryptocurrencies in mind and mostly predating their vast presence. Gensler insists that most cryptocurrency projects must adhere to the laws regulating securities, and in many instances, they fail to comply. Despite the initial interest in Bitcoin , the SEC-era Gensler doesn’t see crypto as something that never existed before and sticks to his guns, repeating a “cryptos are nothing but unregistered securities” mantra. Answering Sorkin’s question, he said crypto is mostly traded leaning on the sentiment and not fundamentals, but if (sic!) the fundamentals are there, crypto companies should make disclosures adhering to the securities laws. Bitcoin is not a security, but other cryptocurrencies are dangerous Gensler said that Bitcoin is not a security now (sic!), but other thousands of cryptocurrencies pose a threat to the investing public, and it’s his duty as a law enforcement agent to protect these people from fraud, money laundering and other crimes. “There has been too much of that in this field,” Gensler said. More than that, he is sure that the exchanges are “trading against their customers.” As for Bitcoin, Gensler compared the first cryptocurrency to gold and noted that it is a highly volatile speculative asset, but people want to trade it. However, Gensler said he cannot predict the future of Bitcoin, and he doesn’t know whether it will have any value in 10 or 20 years from now. Sorkin said that Gensler’s attempts to fight Bitcoin were in vain as at the end of Gensler’s era, Bitcoin was as popular as never before. At the same time, Gensler failed to prevent this great bubble from blowing (if it proved to be a bubble). Twice, Gensler dodged to comment on how he feels about his role in both of these scenarios, none of which portrays him as a winner. Listing his main achievements as the SEC chair, he mentioned reforms in the stock market policy and other sectors not related to cryptocurrencies. Afterword It is interesting how Gary Gensler went from a tech-savvy official genuinely intrigued by the potential of blockchain technology to a rigid gatekeeper in just two years. In 2019, he wrote an inspired editorial on the future of Bitcoin for CoinDesk. In 2021, he became the most notorious cryptocurrency foe in SEC history. A person who famously called stablecoins “poker chips” for gambling, he dedicated his time in the SEC to legal battles with Binance, Coinbase, Ripple, and Gemini while overlooking the FTX collapse. Hopefully, now that he is retiring, he will find peace. He says he never owned any cryptocurrencies. Who knows what’s next for Gensler, will he soften his heart to Bitcoin?

Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, commented on the event with a bold statement on social media. Alderoty suggested that starting Saturday, Gensler would no longer hold relevance in discussions surrounding the US SEC. Gary Gensler’s Last Day as US SEC Chair: Ripple CLO Alderoty Comments In a post on X , Stuart Alderoty, Ripple CLO, mocked Gary Gensler’s departure from the SEC. He remarked that the crypto industry would soon ask, “Gary who?” Alderoty’s comments come amidst Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC, which began in 2020. The SEC has alleged that Ripple sold XRP as an unregistered security, a claim the company has denied. Despite the XRP company’s partial court victory in 2023, where the judge ruled that XRP sales to retail investors did not violate securities laws. However, the US SEC appealed the decision prolonging uncertainty for Ripple and the crypto industry. In recent reports on the XRP lawsuit , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an appeal challenging the district court’s 2023 ruling that XRP is not a security. The SEC argues that all XRP transactions, including programmatic sales to retail investors, qualify as investment contracts under the Howey Test. Gary Gensler’s legacy as SEC Chair is marked by an aggressive approach to regulating the crypto industry. Under his leadership, the SEC initiated over 80 lawsuits against crypto companies, including prominent names such as Coinbase, Uniswap, and Ripple. Despite the controversies, Gensler claimed that crypto enforcement accounted for only a small portion of the SEC’s overall activities. Supporters of his tenure highlighted efforts to protect investors and enforce compliance across the financial sector. The former US SEC chair shared a video on X, reflecting on the four years in office. It has been the privilege of a lifetime to work for you as @SECGov Chair.

Analysts noted the formation of a bullish pennant pattern on XRP’s weekly price chart. The pattern, often indicative of strong upward momentum, has led some analysts to forecast a potential short-term target of $10. Source: TradingView The bullish outlook is boosted by improved market sentiment surrounding Ripple’s chances in its legal battle with the SEC. Market participants remain optimistic about the possibility of reduced regulatory pressure under the Trump administration. Additionally, recent price analysis supports the bullish outlook for XRP , with targets of $5, $10, $15, and $20 in sight. The ongoing rally is fueled by strong technical patterns like the “bull flag” and increased open interest, which recently hit $7.51 billion. Whale accumulation has also intensified, indicating growing investor confidence. Anticipation Grows for XRP ETF Approval More so analysts at JPMorgan broke silence on XRP ETF possibilities, forecasting an inflow of $3 billion to $8 billion if approved by the SEC. The prediction is based on adoption rates similar to BTC and Ether ETFs, which captured 6% and 3% of their market caps, respectively, within their early months. The report highlights the potential for XRP and Solana ETFs to boost liquidity and market adoption. At press time, the Ripple token is trading at $3.27, marking a 39.71% gain over the past 7 days. The cryptocurrency’s market cap stands at $188.16 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $13.8 billion.

The San Francisco-based blockchain company Ripple is marking the occasion with enthusiasm. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief legal officer, took to social media, remarking , “Starting tomorrow, ‘Gary who?’ will be the only appropriate response if someone mentions his name. Onward.” Gesler’s aggressive stance The SEC filed its opening brief in the appeal of its ongoing lawsuit with Ripple earlier this week. The case in question was based on the perceived nature of XRP as a security and has been widely discussed in the cryptocurrency industry. Ripple, however, appears unfazed. Alderoty called the latest legal action “noise,” suggesting that the SEC’s new leadership could adopt a new approach. He also noted that the case could be deferred, as there were reports that certain cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions without fraud claims could be suspended. The appeal comes as the SEC, under Gensler, has been accused of being overly aggressive in the legal arena by many industry participants. Ripple’s lawyer, John Deaton, who is actively involved in the case against the SEC, has also slammed Gensler for his leadership.

Deaton, however, said that there may be changes under the new chair, Paul Atkins, who is a nominee of President-elect Donald Trump. Akins is expected to pause some activities against cryptocurrency companies, which will be favourable to Ripple. According to the reports, the SEC under Atkins intends to allow more cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Analysts predict that the probability of the approval of an XRP ETF in 2025 is 66% which could lead to over $8 billion of inflows. Gensler became the SEC chairman in 2021, and there were high hopes that he would be more receptive to cryptocurrencies due to his experience teaching blockchain and crypto at MIT. At first, some people in the industry, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, applauded his appointment. However, his time in the role has been marked by controversy, as the SEC has sued numerous major crypto firms. It has been the privilege of a lifetime to work for you as @SECGov Chair.

He called his four years at the helm of the SEC “the privilege of a lifetime.” Trump administration and XRP surge The regulatory landscape could see a major change under President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to fire Gensler and adopt more lax market rules. Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse has been constantly in touch with the new administration and reportedly had a meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago this month. According to reports, Garlinghouse proposed the concept of a federal crypto reserve that would include XRP and Bitcoin. However, Ripple has not confirmed these discussions. Despite the prevailing legal ambiguities, XRP has given impressive results. The cryptocurrency recently spiked to $3.23, coming close to its previous record of $3.40 set in 2018. In the past week alone, XRP has jumped by more than 40%, with higher-value transactions and the number of holders on the rise. Currently, XRP is trading at $3.28, having risen by 2% in the last 24 hours. According to Analytics firm Santiment, there were 2,365 XRP transactions worth more than $100,000 within a day for eight hours. Also, over 500,000 new XRP wallets have been created in the last two months, which speaks about the continuing interest in the token. 📈 XRP has just reached a new 7-year high, crossing a $3.39 market value for the first time since January, 2018.

These programs provide returns in the form of three cryptocurrencies associated with Nova Labs: Helium Network Token (HNT) Helium Mobile Network Token (MOBILE) Helium IoT Network Token (IOT) The SEC alleges that these activities qualify as unregistered securities offerings and violate federal securities regulations that require issuers to disclose important financial and operational details to protect investors.

XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have established themselves as top contenders, but a new player, Lightchain AI, is quickly emerging as a project that could outpace them all. Currently priced at $0.00525 and having raised over $10.6 million during its presale, Lightchain AI, is attracting significant attention from investors looking for high-growth opportunities. XRP strengths and challenges Traditional international transactions often take several days to complete, with high fees due to multiple intermediaries. In contrast, Ripple’s system enables near-instant transfers, reducing wait times to mere seconds. This speed is achieved by using XRP as a bridge currency, simplifying exchanges and eliminating the need for pre-funded accounts. However, challenges remain, particularly around regulatory scrutiny from agencies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has cast uncertainty on XRP’s classification and future role in financial systems. Although Ripple’s network has expanded, its widespread adoption by conventional banks is still a work in progress. Addressing these issues is crucial for Ripple to solidify XRP’s position in transforming global money transfers.

In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 23:50:00

The SEC accused DCG and Genesis of defrauding investors through misrepresentation, resulting in penalties and legal action. DCG agreed to settle the charges by paying a $38 million fine. SEC Reveals Accounting Tricks Behind DCG’s ‘Strong’ Balance Sheet Claims On January 17, the SEC ordered DCG to pay a $38 million civil penalty and issued a cease-and-desist order to prevent future misconduct. The charges extend to DCG and its former CEO, Soichiro “Michael” Moro, who allegedly misled investors about the financial health of Genesis following the collapse of one of its largest borrowers, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), in mid-2022. The U.S. SEC has charged Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its subsidiary Genesis Global Capital for allegedly concealing significant financial risks arising from the default of Three Arrows Capital in 2022 by disseminating false or misleading information. DCG has been fined $38… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 17, 2025 Moro, who served as CEO of Genesis during this period, was accused of approving misleading public statements and tweets that downplayed financial risks. According to the SEC, Moro authorized posts claiming that Genesis had “shed the risk” associated with 3AC’s default and maintained a “strong” balance sheet, despite the company’s precarious position. Additionally, Moro signed a $1.1 billion promissory note on behalf of Genesis, which the SEC described as perpetuating a false narrative about the company’s financial health. As part of the enforcement action, Moro was fined $500,000 and barred from engaging in any negligent conduct that could mislead investors. The SEC indicated that its findings against Moro could support ongoing investor lawsuits and regulatory actions. The SEC also revealed that DCG executives were aware of over $1 billion in losses at Genesis but sought to portray financial stability. DCG issued a $1.1 billion promissory note to Genesis, described by the SEC as an “accounting asset” with no tangible capital transfer. These actions, coupled with undisclosed terms of the note, misled investors about the company’s true financial state. By June 30, 2022, Genesis reported positive equity, but the company’s financial pressures continued to mount. By November 2022, it suspended withdrawals, affecting customers of Gemini Earn and locking up $900 million in user assets. Genesis and DCG Struggle with Fallout from 2022 Collapse The financial troubles of Genesis began with the collapse of 3AC, which triggered liquidity issues, and worsened with the implosion of FTX later that year. In January 2023, Genesis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy , disclosing over $3.5 billion in debts to its top 50 creditors, including major names like Gemini and VanEck. Genesis’ parent company, DCG, borrowed $500 million across four loans in 2022. However, by May 2023, DCG had failed to repay $620 million, including 4,550 Bitcoin, prompting Genesis to file a lawsuit seeking full repayment plus fees. You might also like Genesis Sues Parent Firm DCG Over $600 Million Loan Repayment In November 2023, DCG reached a settlement to repay the loans by April 2024, offering Genesis some relief in its bankruptcy proceedings. By February 2024, Genesis and Gemini had reached a settlement to distribute $1.8 billion to users of Gemini Earn, pending court approval. By May 2024, Genesis had distributed $2.18 billion worth of cryptocurrency to approximately 232,000 users, advancing its bankruptcy process. Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is pursuing penalties and corrective measures against Gemini Trust, with its trial now set for January 21, 2025. This legal battle adds to the ongoing scrutiny faced by companies tied to DCG and Genesis.

In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, Filbfilb shared insights on Bitcoin’s trajectory amid a recovering market and incoming political changes in the U.S. Trump Administration and Bitcoin Market Dynamics After rebounding from two-month lows, Bitcoin is trading above $100,000 as of Jan. 17, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView data. Filbfilb believes the Trump administration’s pro-Bitcoin stance could boost the market. However, potential trade wars could disrupt the broader risk-asset rally. Despite these uncertainties, Filbfilb predicts Bitcoin will maintain its leadership in the crypto market, possibly achieving record dominance. He remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s ability to outperform equities if favorable policies are enacted quickly. Short-Term Expectations and Market Reactions In response to potential unmet expectations regarding executive orders, Filbfilb said, “I had anticipated a bumpy open to the year with a recovery in the second part of the month, which is what we have seen so far.” While Bitcoin’s current price reflects cautious optimism, he noted, “If something like this is ruled out, I’m sure there would be a dip, but probably an overreaction and perhaps an opportunity.” MicroStrategy and Bitcoin Correlation Discussing MicroStrategy’s stock performance, Filbfilb dismissed claims of it being a “ponzi scheme” but acknowledged its risks. “At present, the premium over net asset value (NAV) is around 2, similar to levels seen when Bitcoin consolidated around $60,000-$70,000,” he explained. If Bitcoin surpasses $100,000, he expects MicroStrategy’s stock to surge, driven by increased interest in Bitcoin. “Short term, I’m not too concerned about a major retracement for MSTR, unless there is a big pullback in Bitcoin,” he added. Long-term concerns about MicroStrategy’s debt servicing are noted but remain a topic for the future.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 23:59:00

For savvy investors, now is the time to stay ahead of the curve. Indeed, there has been news about the Dogecoin price reaching new heights. However, altcoins like WallitIQ (WLTQ) , Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Myro (MYRO) have entered the market with the life-changing potential of turning your $550 into $550,000. Keep reading to understand why these four altcoins are set to skyrocket before the Dogecoin price hits $1. Stock Market Genius Confirms That WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Rise By 1,000x And Dominate The Crypto Market In 2025 WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) upcoming 1,000x rise proves one thing — it is a financial revolution, not just another altcoin. This crypto uses artificial intelligence to make your trading experience convenient. You can trade up to 1,000 cryptocurrencies from one wallet. Priced at just $0.0420 , buying as little as $550 worth of the token now will bring you a whopping $550,000 in returns shortly. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) intuitive Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App has been designed to streamline your wallet and transaction management. There are display QR codes for wallet addresses to receive payments easily. You get access to live market data because of the CoinGecko API integration. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) transaction features include simulated crypto transfers for day-to-day purchases like Starbucks coffee subscriptions.

With its staking rewards of up to 180% APY , you can earn passive income by simply holding WallitIQ (WLTQ). Even the Dogecoin price that stands above WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) $0.0420 cannot compete with this feature. Safety is paramount to crypto investment, and this altcoin delivers. SolidProof has completed WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) smart contract audit to secure your investment. This altcoin’s robust security and growing community contributed to it crossing the one-million-dollar mark just weeks after the presale started. Timing is everything in the crypto world.

Pepe (PEPE) recently broke out of an ascending triangle pattern, which signals a further upside. Pepe’s (PEPE) RSI points to buying pressure, and experts speculate Pepe (PEPE) might achieve exponential gains before the Dogecoin price hits $1. Bonk (BONK) Signals A Potential Breakout Following Its Recent Rally Following its rally that peaked in Q4 last year, Bonk (BONK) has entered a corrective phase. If Bonk (BONK) holds this support and breaks above the wedge resistance, it might experience a breakout. Thus, speculative upward movement in Bonk (BONK) is expected to outpace the Dogecoin price to $1. However, failure to hold this support could lead to a deeper correction for Bonk (BONK). Experts Say Myro (MYRO) Can Deliver 30x Returns In 2025 Currently trading between $0.0618 and $0.0966, Myro (MYRO) shows resilience despite its 13% dip last month. Myro (MYRO) has had a solid 14% growth in the past six months, and it positioned close to its 10-day simple moving average of $0.1491, showing a 55% surge in Myro (MYRO). If Myro (MYRO) maintains this trajectory, it can surpass the Dogecoin price to deliver 30x returns this year. Conclusion Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Myro (MYRO) are showing signs of impressive growth. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is set to dominate all of them with its 1,000x rally. As such, it is understandable that a stock market genius is lauding its potential and credibility. Time is ticking, and the presale is the only chance you have to secure this altcoin at just $0.0420 . Do not waste one more second!

According to insights from Dom (@traderview2), an experienced overflow, volume, and profile trader, this rally diverges from the typical behavior observed in Bitcoin and other assets. It signals genuine demand for the token rather than speculative trading, offering a promising outlook for XRP and the broader market. This demand has been reflected in XRP’s price, as the digital asset recently climbed to $3.39, its highest price since 2018. In a series of analyses supported by technical charts, Dom emphasizes the importance of the spot premium and funding rates remaining unchanged despite the recent upward price movement. “This rally continues to be driven entirely by spot buying,” Dom stated, highlighting the uniqueness of this XRP movement compared to Bitcoin’s often futures-led price surges. It’s absolutely insane to see that $XRP funding rates and spot premium still haven’t moved This rally continues to be driven entirely by spot buying (see 2nd pic), this proves real demand for actual coins This isn’t just another perp-led rally like we always see with $BTC … https://t.co/cMpxOisv76 pic.twitter.com/7bUzGC2eo8 — Dom (@traderview2) January 15, 2025 Real Demand Fuels XRP Growth The charts highlight robust buying pressure on XRP’s spot market, which indicates real demand for the cryptocurrency. This is a notable departure from the behavior of perpetual swaps or leveraged trading, where funding rates typically spike as traders speculate on price movements. In XRP’s case, the absence of significant changes in funding rates reinforces the notion that this rally is backed by buyers seeking actual tokens rather than short-term profits. The significance of this development also extends beyond XRP. XRP has been displaying unusual signs in its price surges, and a market rally driven by spot purchases often reflects increased confidence in the asset, signaling a broader shift in sentiment among investors. Such trends are critical in fostering long-term growth and stability for cryptocurrencies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What’s Next For the Market and XRP XRP’s spot-led rally marks a pivotal moment for the token and the cryptocurrency industry. It serves as an indicator of shifting market dynamics, where speculative futures trading plays a lesser role in driving asset value. This move may attract more institutional and retail investors, offering them confidence in XRP’s utility and resilience. For XRP specifically, this momentum could be linked to the shift in the U.S. political landscape after Donald Trump’s election victory in November, and the excitement surrounding the upcoming resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Increasing adoption and utility in cross-border payments and blockchain solutions also play a significant role, as the token’s role in facilitating efficient and cost-effective transactions has been a key value proposition for years. Dom concludes that this trend could signify much higher price levels for XRP. “If I saw this with BTC, I would simply say we are going much higher,” Dom noted, suggesting that the rally may be far from over.

Its trading volume is also up by 10.58%, reflecting strong market interest. Launched in November 2023, this dog-inspired coin built on Solana has achieved impressive growth in a short time.

It is now trading above $103,000. This marks an 8% gain over the past week, driven by growing interest from large investors and a shift in market dynamics. According to the latest insights from CryptoQuant Analysts, some underlying whale activity factors might be influencing Bitcoin’s current trajectory. Related Reading: Rising Bitcoin Prices Defy Exchange Inflows: What Investors Need to Know Bitcoin Price Rebounds Amid Growing Whale Activity CryptoQuant QuickTake Platform contributor Joao Wedson has recently highlighted a noteworthy trend in whale behavior on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. In a recent analysis, Wedson examined the Exchange Whale Ratio, which measures the share of Bitcoin’s largest inflow transactions relative to the total exchange volume. This metric, according to the analyst has now reached historical highs, signaling that large holders—often referred to as whales—are transferring significant amounts of Bitcoin to the exchange. The increased movement of Bitcoin by whales may indicate that they are preparing for substantial buy or sell actions, potentially amplifying market volatility. Wedson added: Stay alert! Intense movements by major players can bring volatility risks but also unique opportunities for those closely monitoring the market. Understanding New Whale Movements and Market Cycles In addition to whale activity on Binance, another CryptoQuant contributor, KriptoBaykusV2, provided insights into the emergence of new large investors in the market. According to KriptoBaykusV2, the “New Whales” indicator highlights the influx of previously inactive large investors acquiring Bitcoin. Over the past three years, this metric has grown steadily, suggesting heightened interest in the cryptocurrency market. However, the entry and exit of new whales often coincide with price swings, making it a key factor for understanding market cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Target $145,000 To $249,000 Under Trump Administration: Report Historical data shows that peaks in new whale activity often align with periods of price volatility. For example, during 2021 and 2023, sharp increases in the number of new large investors were followed by significant price corrections.

39115457,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=645890,1737161574,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/39115457.jpeg,Study reveals social media influence on cryptocurrency investment behavior,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/social-media-influence-on-cryptocurrency/,"A recent study from the University of Georgia shows a high correlation between social media use and crypto investment. The study, published in the International Journal of Bank Marketing, aims to analyze the influence of social media on investors’ behaviour towards cryptocurrencies. The research done by Kyoung Tae Kim and Lu Fan investigates the connection between time spent on social media and the propensity of people to invest in cryptocurrencies. The study shows that social media significantly influences investment decisions, including risky ones such as cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies remain rather popular, even though they are characterized by high fluctuations. This study demonstrates that social media is one of the key determinants of investors’ perceptions and behaviour. The study also shows that investors who gain their information through social media are likely to invest in cryptocurrencies and view future investment in this area positively. The role of social media platforms One of the key insights of the research is the differential effect of different social media platforms on cryptocurrency investment behaviour. The study revealed that the probability of people investing in cryptocurrency grows with the number of platforms used. Some platforms seem to promote a higher level of confidence when it comes to investing, as conversations regarding cryptocurrency are often enough to sway users. According to one of the researchers, Lu Fan, the discussion surrounding cryptocurrencies has been on the rise, especially with the celebrities on social networks. He notes that many people are motivated by the desire to imitate their friends and relatives or even celebrities who also invest in the same business. Youth and financial literacy The study also shows that there is one significant pattern among young people. This study showed that the younger population is not only the main consumer of social media but also the main investor in cryptocurrencies. However, this group might not be well informed on financial matters, which may make them very sensitive to social media influence. Fan underscores the need for young adults, especially those who lack sufficient experience in handling money, to be well-guided in making the right investment decisions. He points out that while information on social media can be useful, it can also lead to investment decisions made based on hype rather than knowledge of the financial markets. The number of young adults investing in cryptocurrencies is on the rise every day across the globe. According to Bappebti, Indonesia’s commodity futures trading regulatory agency, 62% of Indonesia’s crypto investors were between 18 and 30 years old as of October 2024. This trend is in line with young people from Indonesia investing in cryptocurrencies, with 26.9% of investors being 18-24 years old and 35.1% being 25-30 years old. According to a study from Bitget Research, Generation Z and the Millennial generation are becoming more interested in cryptocurrencies. The research further found that 20% of Gen Z is the most targeted group of crypto scams. However, this group is still interested in crypto and its opportunities, especially as a means of payment. Cryptocurrency adoption This is not a trend that is limited to Asia only, as more and more young people are using cryptocurrencies. Telegram-based crypto communities in Africa expanded by 189% from the beginning of 2023 to 2024, and over 56% of its users are below 25 years old. Young people in Europe are also participating, with 32% of Millennials and 29% of Gen Z investing in cryptocurrencies, according to a 2024 study by Bitpanda and YouGov. Cryptocurrency adoption is also increasing at a faster rate than both mobile phones and the internet worldwide. According to BlackRock’s Jay Jacobs, mobile phones took 21 years and the internet 15 years to garner 300 million users, while cryptocurrencies reached the same number in just 12 years. Bitcoin stands out with a $2 trillion market cap and still leads the industry as the demand for decentralized assets grows in a digital economy.
