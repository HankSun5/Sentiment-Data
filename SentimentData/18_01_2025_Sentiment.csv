Whales Purchase Over $1 Billion in ETH appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The overall cryptocurrency market has shown strong bullish potential ahead of President-elect and pro-crypto advocate Donald Trump’s inauguration, scheduled for January 20, 2025. However, one thing that has been capturing the massive attention of crypto enthusiasts is the recent activity of crypto giants over the past week. Whales Purchase Over $1 Billion in ETH Recently, a prominent crypto expert posted on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that whales have purchased over a billion dollars worth of Ethereum (ETH) in the past week. The expert stated that more than 330,000 ETH, valued at over $1 billion, has been acquired by these crypto whales. Whales have accumulated over 330,000 #Ethereum $ETH in the past week, valued at more than $1 billion! pic.twitter.com/aNuP9HFwEh — Ali (@ali_charts) January 17, 2025 This large accumulation of ETH by whales suggests a strategic move to capitalize on Trump’s inauguration, which is expected to have a positive impact on the crypto market. However, experts and analysts are already speculating that the crypto market could experience a significant surge following the inauguration day. In the meantime, there is also a possibility of profit booking as the market has been rising over the past few days. However, only time will tell where the market will head after this upcoming political event. Current Price Momentum and Rising Participation Currently, ETH has crossed the $3,500 mark and is trading near $3,515. It has experienced a price surge of over 5.5% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, it has attracted significant traders and investors, resulting in an 11% jump in trading volume. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action and Key Levels With the impressive price surge, ETH has once again reached the crucial resistance level of $3,500, where it previously experienced a price reversal. According to expert technical analysis, if ETH breaches this resistance level and closes a daily candle above $3,550, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 15% to reach the $4,100 mark in the coming days.

Wyoming took its first bold step toward a strategic bitcoin reserve! Thank you Rep. Wasserburger for introducing legislation to allow permanent funds to diversify into Bitcoin. This forward-thinking approach will benefit our state as we lead the nation in financial innovation! — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) January 17, 2025 Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the first to highlight the proposal, emphasized its potential benefits to the state’s financial strategy. “This forward-thinking approach will benefit our state as we lead the nation in financial innovation,” Lummis remarked . Wyoming’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Proposal: Will It Inspire Others? As states explore the potential of integrating Bitcoin into public financial strategies, Wyoming’s latest proposal sets a precedent that could influence others, including Massachusetts. According to Wasserburger, the bill’s sponsor, the proposal aligns with Wyoming’s history of pioneering firsts. “Wyoming has always been a pioneer—from women’s suffrage to the first national park; from the invention of the LLC to the frontier of digital assets.,” Wasserburger said. Source: wyoleg.gov HB0201 authorizes the state treasurer to invest portions of Wyoming’s general fund, permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund, and permanent land fund in Bitcoin, with investments capped at 3% of these funds to balance potential gains with prudent risk management. To address security concerns, the bill requires robust custody solutions for Bitcoin holdings, emphasizing the protection of private keys and adherence to strict security standards. The proposal leverages Wyoming’s comprehensive legislative framework, including the Wyoming Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) model, which has gained widespread recognition in the digital asset space. Since 2018, Wyoming has established itself as a pioneer in Bitcoin-friendly legislation, passing more than two dozen laws supporting digital assets. These initiatives include recognizing Bitcoin as property and providing regulatory clarity for blockchain companies, solidifying the state’s reputation as a hub for digital innovation. Alongside Wyoming, Massachusetts has also proposed a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Source: Bitcoin Magazine / X State Senator Peter Durant, who filed the bill, expressed enthusiasm about advancing legislation that could shape the state’s financial future. Excited to get to work on this legislation! https://t.co/zT6W3JeGZh — State Senator Peter Durant (@senpeterdurant) January 17, 2025 The Economic Case for a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bitcoin , often referred to as “digital gold,” has demonstrated substantial appreciation and resilience over the past decade. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply align with principles of fiscal independence and economic stability. As a result, many institutions, companies, and countries have begun incorporating Bitcoin into their investment portfolios. Wasserburger emphasized the urgency of adopting such measures, stating, “We can’t afford to sit on the sidelines while other states move forward with their own Bitcoin reserve bills.” Establishing a Bitcoin reserve could help Wyoming mitigate risks associated with inflation and economic volatility while ensuring long-term financial security for its citizens. The proposal also aligns with Senator Cynthia Lummis’ advocacy for a United States Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Lummis’ 2024 draft of the Bitcoin Act, which proposed creating a federal Bitcoin reserve to reinforce America’s financial standing, has laid the groundwork for current legislative efforts. Elsewhere, momentum for Bitcoin reserves continues to grow. On January 16, Texas Senator Charles Schwertner filed Senate Bill 778 (SB 778) to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Internationally, the Czech Republic’s central bank is also exploring Bitcoin as a reserve asset , as governments and institutions continue to evaluate the digital asset’s potential.

The crypto exchange’s update follows a joint statement from the U.S., Japan, and South Korea that was published this week. The statement attributed the attacks to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, or North Korea), including the infamous Lazarus Group. According to the firm, the freezing was the first significant step in a long and intricate recovery procedure that involved numerous jurisdictions and court cases. WazirX initiates recovery efforts after losing $230 million WazirX’s July 2024 resulted in the loss of nearly 45% of the platform’s total cryptocurrency assets, or more than $230 million. The firm’s hack ranks third among the largest crypto hacks and exploits recorded in 2024, following PlayDapp’s $290 million and DMM Bitcoin’s $308 million in losses. The attack that wiped out most of the platform’s assets left WazirX with more than $546.5 million in liabilities. Multiple layers of security, including six signatories and whitelisted destination addresses, protected the compromised wallet, which relied on Liminal’s digital asset custody infrastructure. However, the hackers took advantage of a significant flaw, a difference between the data shown on Liminal’s interface and the real transaction details. The scammers could reverse-engineer the system and take control of the wallet. After the incident, WazirX parted ways with Liminal Custody. In August 2024, the company has since followed up with a restructuring filing with a Singapore court. WazirX, an exchange founded and currently owned by Zettai in Singapore, has been working with lawyers, forensic experts, and the police to try to recover the stolen funds. WazirX vows to resume trading by February 2025 In November 2024, cofounder Nischal Shetty assured users at a town hall meeting that recovery was underway and said trading could reopen in February 2025. Freezing some of the swiped stablecoins presents a breakthrough event to regain confidence and pay off affected users. Earlier U.N. reports estimated that North Korea stole $3 billion in crypto between 2017 and 2023 to fund its sanctioned nuclear weapons programs. Recent data from Chainalysis showed North Korean hackers were responsible for 61% of all cryptocurrency stolen in 2024, totaling $1.34 billion.

When a company files in such a manner, it means that it has submitted its initial registration statement with the SEC but is yet to make it public. This initial filing will help it gather feedback from the agency and make necessary adjustments before officially announcing its IPO plans. eToro to Go Public in New York According to a report by the Financial Times, which cited people with knowledge of the matter, the Israeli-based crypto and stock trading platform could go public in New York as early as Q2 2025—if successful. It targets a valuation of $5 billion, up from a $3.5 billion market cap in 2023. The report revealed that eToro has partnered with Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and UBS to carry out its plans. This means that these investment banks will guide eToro through the IPO process. Not the First This is not the first time eToro has attempted to go public in the US. In 2021, it entered a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) deal with FinTech Acquisition Corp. V. at a valuation of $10.4 billion. However, the plan fell through due to the bear market of 2022. The SEC did not approve that plan. Multiple crypto-related companies have also attempted to go public through a SPAC deal but have been unsuccessful. In July 2021, USDC issuer Circle filed for an IPO with the SEC through a SPAC deal but later abandoned the plan because it did not meet the SEC’s qualifications at the time. This deal could have given Circle a $9 billion valuation. Crypto miner Prime Blockchain also canceled plans to go public through a SPAC deal in 2022. If successful, eToro will join crypto companies like Coinbase and Bakkt to go public in the US. Several Bitcoin miners, including Marathon Digital, are also listed in the US.

Based on CryptoQuant’s analysis, the surge suggests an increase in institutional investors utilizing OTC channels to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC). Institutional BTC Preference Triggers OTC Trading From the data provided by analysts at CryptoQuant, the spike in inflows resembles a similar trend seen on December 17. Noteworthy, that was the day that Bitcoin hit its all-time high (ATH) of over $108,000. According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, such a significant surge in inflows on the Coinbase platform usually indicates that multiple OTC trades are occurring. It also reflects institutions’ preferences to accumulate bitcoin through OTC trading. Julio Moreno, the head of research at CryptoQuant, highlighted that the inflows represent the BTC sourced from Coinbase for institutional clients. Furthermore, he noted that OTC flows recently reached $14 billion, equivalent to 142,000 Bitcoin on the American centralized exchange. Growing Institutional Adoption of BTC With Pro-crypto Government Generally, the digital asset landscape has registered some improvements in the months that followed the United States 2024 presidential elections. Republican politician Donald Trump, known for his pro-crypto stance, won the race , uplifting the ecosystem’s spirit. He is finally coming into power by January 20. One of the moves he intends to make today is ousting Gary Gensler, the current United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman. Former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins has been nominated to replace him. This move is expected to bring more favorable policies to the crypto industry. Bitcoin price will likely register more rally, to the point of oven hitting a new ATH. BTC Price Performance and Potential At this time, Bitcoin traded at $104,951.39, corresponding with a 5.58% increase within 24 hours. While this is a lofty price level, it is still significantly lower than the coin’s ATH of over $108,000. With several nations, including the US, vying to add the flagship cryptocurrency to their strategic reserve, BTC will likely register more gains. The potential growth in Bitcoin ETF inflows could also contribute to the price rally.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Exploring Cardano, Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and Remittix as standout cryptos for 2025. Table of Contents Cardano eyes RLUSD Solana ready for the next ETF surge XRP rides the bullish wave Dogecoin: Meme to payment option Remittix: The PayFi contender Remittix takes center stage Building a well-rounded crypto lineup for the future is on every investor’s mind. On that note, Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and the rising star Remittix have gained attention so far in 2025. Cardano eyes RLUSD Cardano recently made headlines when its founder Charles Hoskinson revealed talks to integrate Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD. The Cardano team sees RLUSD as a perfect fit to strengthen its stablecoin offerings, which already include tokens like USDM and Djed. If this integration works out, Cardano could boost its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, drawing more liquidity and user adoption. Investors still recall that Cardano’s ADA token hit a two-year high before volatile market conditions triggered a decline. Long-term holders believe that stablecoin collaborations could help ADA stabilize and even push it upward in 2025. Solana ready for the next ETF surge Solana currently trades at around $219, showing a 17% increase over the past seven days. Banking giants hint that a spot-based SOL exchange-traded fund could bring in billions in new investments. If approvals materialize in the coming months, Solana might see another massive climb, especially if Donald Trump’s administration leans more crypto-friendly. The Solana network’s main attraction is its high-speed transactions, perfect for NFTs and DeFi. However, critics note the occasional outages that undermine user trust. If Solana solves its downtime issues and secures an ETF listing, many experts think it might become the major DeFi powerhouse in 2025. You might also like: Remittix tipped for greater long-term growth than Shiba Inu and Dogecoin XRP rides the bullish wave The XRP price has surged over 40% in the last week and past 30 days. A court ruling clarified that XRP isn’t a security in secondary markets, fueling confidence. There’s also growing speculation that a spot-based XRP ETF could appear soon, with executives like Ripple President Monica Long feeling upbeat. While regulatory uncertainties hang overhead, optimism remains. Ripple aims to expand XRP’s use in remittances and corporate payments, and a bullish run could continue if ETFs or big partners jump on board. Dogecoin: Meme to payment option Priced around $0.41 dollars, Dogecoin is up 24.71% in the last week. Major whale moves have rattled watchers, but some interpret these big transactions as signs of renewed interest. Tesla’s decision to accept DOGE for select payments hints at mainstream acceptance. While Dogecoin has soared in the past on celebrity endorsements and community zeal, it needs lasting adoption to stay relevant. If its developers deliver more on the utility front, DOGE could maintain its standing as an iconic crypto. Nonetheless, some see it as a gateway token for newbies, which might keep the coin rising through 2025. You might also like: Solana, Sui investors flock to new viral altcoin Remittix Remittix: The PayFi contender Despite not being a legacy token, Remittix is attracting big buzz for its PayFi approach — mixing crypto innovation with traditional banking. In just three weeks, Remittix raised over $3 million in its presale, pushing the token price up from $0.0199 to $0.0207. Analysts suggest that Remittix could hit a 1-dollar milestone if enough users adopt it for cross-border payments. Unlike meme or purely DeFi tokens, Remittix focuses on everyday transactions. By enabling fast crypto-to-fiat settlements with zero hidden fees, Remittix appeals to businesses and individuals alike. Its Pay API will help merchants accept crypto payments, converting them to fiat in under 24 hours. Remittix takes center stage Cardano might soon integrate RLUSD, Solana could see an ETF windfall, XRP edges closer to regulatory clarification, and Dogecoin remains an entertaining fan favorite. However, Remittix is the big story — its PayFi model sets it apart as an easy-to-use altcoin for cross-border transactions. To learn more about Remittix, visit their website or social media channels.

Elon Bromance (ELOBRO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOBRO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Bromance by entering its contract address – FY7aYv7K3yEE9Z8hzgURj5z7biTE8Z6BpunBPAnCEpxj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOBRO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 22:33:00

However, since the company has a European regional headquarters in Paris, it is more probable that the approval was given by the French financial authorities. According to Eric Anziani, Crypto.com’s president and COO, MiCA is crucial because it helps build trust in the crypto sector. “We have always been fully supportive of MiCA and strongly believe it will bring clarity, transparency, and establish a more streamlined sentiment towards the regulation of our industry across the EU.” Eric Anziani In 2021, Crypto.com was also issued a Class 3 Virtual Financial Assets (VFA) License by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), which enabled it to place orders, offer custody services, and operate on its own account. The MFSA also granted the company in-principle approval of the Financial Institution License. Impact of MiCA on the crypto industry MiCA sets out comprehensive regulations for crypto assets, service providers, and jurisdictional governance. It is meant to harmonize operations while ensuring compliance with EU-wide standards. The framework also outlines a set of tough rules for stablecoins. Earlier this week, Dutch regulators granted MiCA licenses to four crypto companies, including MoonPay. Circle, the creator of USDC stablecoin and a cryptocurrency firm, also secured the EU’s inaugural MiCA greenlight last year. As a result, in July 2024, Circle became an e-money institution (EMI) in France, which allowed the company to function under the stringent EU regulation of cryptocurrencies. Boerse Stuttgart Digital has been among the earliest ones to secure a MiCA license in Germany. The license was issued by the German regulator BaFin and enables Boerse Stuttgart Digital to provide all of its services across the EU member states. MiCA could also set a precedent for regulating crypto outside of Europe. According to Cryptopolitan, it provides a unified framework that other nations may follow. Cryptopolitan further stated , “MiCA’s structured approach may influence global regulators, especially in the US, where enforcement often outweighs clear rulemaking.” The in-principle MiCA approval is part of Crypto.com’s larger plan to grow its footprint in the world. Launched in 2016, the exchange now has more than 100 million users. The firm has obtained licenses in key jurisdictions such as Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom.

The lawsuit names former CEO Gregory Becker, ex-CFO Daniel Beck, and 15 others. The FDIC, acting as SVB’s receiver, says the defendants ignored basic banking principles and internal risk policies. Instead, they allegedly chased profits and a higher stock price, exposing the bank to “catastrophic risks,” according to the court documents. Risky bets and a $294 million dividend At the heart of the FDIC’s allegations is a series of poor decisions tied to interest rates and liquidity management. Silicon Valley Bank was heavily reliant on long-term government bonds, including U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, which were sensitive to rising interest rates. When the Federal Reserve began hiking rates in response to inflation, these assets plummeted in value, slashing SVB’s ability to cover liabilities. The FDIC also criticized a “grossly imprudent” $294 million dividend payment made to SVB’s parent company in December 2022. By draining the bank’s capital just three months before its collapse, the payment left SVB vulnerable at a time when it desperately needed cash to stay afloat. Defendants fight back Lawyers for Laura Izurieta, SVB’s former Chief Risk Officer, pushed back hard against the allegations. Izurieta left the bank in April 2022, nearly a year before the meltdown. Her legal team called her inclusion in the suit “outrageous,” claiming she provided sound advice on risk management before her departure. Other defendants, including Becker, have not publicly commented, though Reuters reports that Becker’s legal team said he was traveling and unavailable. Silicon Valley Bank’s downfall began on March 8, 2023, when the bank announced it had sold $21 billion worth of securities at a staggering $1.8 billion loss. It also shared plans to raise $2.25 billion through a stock sale to cover the hole in its balance sheet. That announcement set off a chain reaction of panic. By March 9, venture capital firms and tech startups were withdrawing deposits at an alarming rate. Founders Fund, led by Peter Thiel, reportedly pulled all its deposits, and by the end of the day, SVB faced $42 billion in withdrawal requests—equal to a quarter of its total deposits. The bank ended the day with a negative cash balance of nearly $1 billion, making regulatory intervention inevitable. On March 10, regulators seized SVB. The collapse stunned Silicon Valley, as SVB had long been the go-to bank. Its demise also rattled financial markets including crypto, as an unusually high percentage of the bank’s deposits—over 90%—were uninsured. Aftermath and acquisition by First Citizens The FDIC claims it tried to act quickly and stabilize the situation, telling depositors that all funds, including those above the $250,000 insurance limit, would be accessible by March 13, 2023. But the damage was already done. And SVB’s collapse triggered a domino effect, with Signature Bank and First Republic Bank also going under in the weeks that followed. On March 26, North Carolina-based First Citizens BancShares stepped in to acquire most of SVB’s assets and deposits in a deal brokered by the FDIC. First Citizens took over tens of billions in loans but left $90 billion worth of securities under FDIC receivership. At the time of its collapse, SVB had $209 billion in assets, making it the 16th largest bank in the United States. Its failure now sits alongside infamous banking disasters like Washington Mutual’s 2008 collapse.

The allure of RCO Finance stems not only from its innovative features but also from the promise of massive returns, post-presale, drawing in investors who are looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto space. Cardano and Solana Struggle to Regain Momentum Cardano (ADA) has demonstrated resilience, with its price currently around $1.05, up 4% over the past week. This price gain comes amidst Cardano’s efforts to enhance its scalability through Hydra, its layer-2 scaling solution, which recently allowed it to process over 2 billion transactions in just four hours, surpassing Solana in transaction speed. This technological leap has sparked renewed investor interest, positioning Cardano as a strong contender in the DeFi space despite upcoming token unlocks that are expected to have minimal market impact. On the other hand, Solana has been on an upward trajectory, trading at approximately $189.22, despite a 4.2% decline over the past week. Over the year, it has seen a modest 99% price increase. This rise in SOL’s price can be attributed to growing speculation around a potential Solana ETF approval and substantial network activity, including the listing of new memecoins like ACT and PNUT on Binance. Additionally, Solana’s open interest has crossed $5 billion, reflecting a significant increase in capital inflows, which suggests robust market participation and confidence in its continued bullish momentum. However, Solana still faces challenges like network congestion, which it is actively working to resolve through technological updates like its v1.16 release, introducing features such as ‘confidential transfers’ for enhanced privacy. These developments have led investors from both Cardano and Solana ecosystems to explore new opportunities, with RCO Finance (RCOF) emerging as a cryptocurrency with potentially higher returns through its innovative use of AI and broad asset access. Investors Eye RCO Finance (RCOF) for Lucrative Returns The presale of RCO Finance’s native token, RCOF, has captured the attention of those looking to diversify from Cardano and Solana. Currently, in its fourth presale stage , the RCOF token’s price has surged by 509% to $0.07770 from its initial offering, signaling strong market interest. As the presale progresses to its final round, the price is expected to jump another 175% to $0.21420, offering early investors significant gains even before the token hits public exchanges. Upon listing, RCOF is projected to debut between $0.4 and $0.6, but the real excitement revolves around what happens post-launch. With the official rollout of the RCO Finance platform, the value of RCOF could soar by as much as 43,000%, offering early investors a chance to see their investments multiply immensely. This expectation is not just based on hype but on the robust features and utility that RCO Finance is set to introduce to the DeFi landscape. RCO Finance: Revolutionizing DeFi with AI and Accessibility RCO Finance stands out with its AI-powered Robo Advisor , which dynamically crafts investment strategies tailored to individual financial goals, risk profiles, and market conditions. This AI tool will analyze vast amounts of data in real time, adjusting portfolios to maximize returns, a feature that democratizes access to sophisticated financial strategies without the need for intermediaries. Moreover, RCO Finance will offer trading across over 120,000 assets, including tokenized real-world assets like real estate, which were previously out of reach for many retail investors. This wide asset selection supports diversification, which is key in managing investment risks. The platform shall also operate within a KYC-free ecosystem, focusing on user privacy and ease of access, allowing users to engage with DeFi without cumbersome identity verifications. Security is not compromised, as evidenced by the smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof, which ensures the integrity and safety of investments on the platform. The tokenomics of RCOF further enhances its appeal, with a significant portion of tokens allocated for public sale, ensuring community involvement in governance and decision-making. This model, combined with a deflationary mechanism where unsold tokens are burned, supportsthe long-term value appreciation of RCOF. Given these features, RCO Finance is poised to revolutionize how investments are made in the DeFi sector, potentially leading to a tremendous growth trajectory for its native token, RCOF. With its AI-driven platform, broad asset access, and commitment to privacy and security, RCO Finance could indeed witness an exponential surge in its token’s value, making it a focal point for Cardano and Solana traders looking for the next big move in cryptocurrency investment.

This impressive rebound has sparked renewed optimism among investors, who are now eyeing the potential for a bullish continuation in the weeks ahead. The rapid price increase has positioned Solana as one of the top-performing assets in the crypto market, signaling a potential shift in momentum. Related Reading: Ondo Finance Funding Rate Signals Greed Among Investors – Sign Of Strength? Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared a detailed technical analysis, highlighting that Solana has broken out of its prolonged downtrend. According to Jelle, SOL has successfully reclaimed crucial monthly and weekly support levels, indicating a significant move could be on the horizon. These levels, often considered key benchmarks for long-term stability, suggest that Solana’s recent gains may be more than just a temporary bounce. If Solana can sustain this momentum, it may not only recover from recent losses but also pave the way for further gains, potentially outperforming other major altcoins. As technical indicators align with market enthusiasm, Solana could be gearing up for a breakout rally that captures the spotlight. Solana Set To Enter Price Discovery Phase Solana (SOL) emerged as one of the top market performers in 2024, posting an impressive surge of over 170%. This stellar performance cemented its position as a market leader and highlighted its resilience and growth potential within the crypto space. As 2025 unfolds, optimism surrounding Solana remains high, with many investors anticipating significant gains in the coming months. The momentum appears to be building already, as Solana begins the year with a potential breakout. Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared insights on X, pointing out that SOL has successfully broken out of the downtrend that had restrained it since late November. Moreover, Solana has reclaimed both monthly and weekly support levels—crucial milestones indicating that the asset has regained its bullish footing. According to Jelle, the price action for Solana is “super clean,” suggesting that the cryptocurrency is well-positioned for higher valuations. Jelle’s initial target for SOL is set at $330, a level that would not only mark a significant recovery but could also push Solana into a price discovery phase. This phase typically sees heightened market interest and volatility as traders and investors recalibrate expectations for the asset’s long-term value. With technical indicators and market sentiment aligning, Solana appears poised to capitalize on its upward trajectory.

As anticipation builds for further upside, traders and investors are closely monitoring key levels, knowing that the cryptocurrency’s next big move could redefine its role in the broader crypto ecosystem. SOL Testing Crucial Supply Around $220 Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $218, approaching a critical level that could determine its next major move. The price is on the verge of setting a new local high above $222, a significant resistance point. Breaking through this level would signal a strong bullish continuation, setting the stage for massive price appreciation and the potential to reclaim its all-time high (ATH). Analysts believe that if SOL clears the $222 mark and maintains its momentum, the next key level to watch is $250. Reclaiming and holding $250 as support would pave the way for Solana to enter uncharted territory, pushing its price into a new all-time high and potentially beginning a price discovery phase. This development would further solidify Solana’s position as a market leader and attract increased investor attention.

Such a pause in price action might delay Solana’s rally but could also provide a foundation for renewed momentum in the future. With market participants closely monitoring these levels, Solana’s price movements in the coming days will be pivotal in determining whether the cryptocurrency embarks on its next major leg up or enters a temporary holding pattern.

The study, published in the International Journal of Bank Marketing, aimed to “investigate the associations between social media usage and cryptocurrency investment behavior.” “Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity among investors despite their high risk and volatility. Social media wields substantial influence over investors’ attitudes, judgments and decisions related to investment.” The study, conducted by researchers Kyoung Tae Kim and Lu Fan, claims to be one of the first of its kind. “This study is one of the initial attempts to examine the role of social media platforms in cryptocurrency investment. The findings offer unique and important theoretical and practical insights for policymakers, researchers and practitioners, which can benefit consumer well-being.” According to the researchers, the study concluded that social media users are more likely to invest in cryptocurrency. “Investors who used social media for investment information were more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies and consider investing in cryptocurrencies in the future. The likelihood increased with the number of social media platforms used. Different social media platforms exhibited distinct associations with cryptocurrency investment experiences and future considerations.” According to researcher Lu Fan , much of the chatter surrounding cryptocurrency originates from and echoes within social media. “A lot of people talk about cryptocurrency on social media and how popular it has become. There are a lot of celebrities talking about this. People are thinking, ‘Because my friends, families and the celebrities I admire all invest in that, maybe I should too.” Fan also highlights a link between youth, social media use, and crypto investments. “Our study showed that the younger adults are more likely to invest in crypto now, and they’re also the majority users of social media. So, when serving those young adults who usually need to gain more financial literacy through life experience and age, there needs to be some guidance as well.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Pepe’s price surges, attention is also shifting to Wall Street Pepe as its presale hits the $50 million mark. Table of Contents PEPE’s next move Wall Street Pepe could be the next PEPE Popular meme coin Pepe (PEPE) witnessed a 12% surge in the past 24 hours, pushing its price to $0.00002028. With a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $1.4 billion, the token is demonstrating significant market activity. The rally comes as the overall crypto market gains momentum, with PEPE securing the 23rd spot by market cap, which now stands at $8.53 billion. Meanwhile, the new frog meme coin Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) hit $50m in what looks to be one of this year’s hottest crypto presales. PEPE’s next move On the technical front, PEPE is trading above its 9-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $0.00001980 and its 9-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $0.00002002. These levels signal short-term bullish momentum as the token continues its recovery from recent lows. The Bollinger Bands indicate narrowing volatility, with the price testing the upper band of $0.00002020. This pattern suggests the potential for another breakout if the bullish sentiment persists. Key support for $PEPE stands at $0.00001950, the mid-point of the Bollinger Bands. A drop below this level could see the token retrace toward $0.00001860, potentially reversing the recent upward trend. On the upside, immediate resistance is at $0.00002060, the upper end of its 24-hour range. A breakout past this level could lead to testing the key psychological mark of $0.00002200. Investor confidence in PEPE remains high, as indicated by its robust volume and sharp price movement. If the current bullish momentum holds, $PEPE could be poised for another leg up, but failure to maintain support levels could signal a short-term correction.

Digesting the SEC chairman’s exit interview,https://crypto.news/gary-genslers-political-testament-exit-interview/,"On Jan. 14, 2025, Gary Gensler had a farewell interview on CNBC. On January 20, he will step down as the chairman of the SEC. What were their conclusive words to the crypto community? At the very start of the interview, the host, Andrew Ross Sorkin, makes a remark that sets the context. He notes that even in the last few days of Gensler’s tenure as the SEC chair and launch of the Trump administration 2.0, Robinhood brokers had to settle $45 million SEC charges associated with violations of ten law provisions. Read more: Robinhood hit with $45m SEC settlement over securities violations At that time, Sorkin didn’t know that after the interview, the SEC would rekindle the case against Ripple. Gary Gensler opens the Ripple case yet again. #BreakingNews #CryptoNews #NewsUpdate #Ripple #Trump #ElonMusk #XRPArmy pic.twitter.com/eSYGdkp1jH — Rexla (@RexlaGlobal) January 17, 2025 Sorkin’s smart tone-setting remark paints Gensler as a soldier relentlessly fighting to protect the prehistoric laws from the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Let’s see what Gary told the CNBC hosts over various topics during an exit interview. Trump 2.0 as pro-crypto administration Admitting that donors from the crypto field were prominent in sponsoring Trump’s campaign, Gensler noted that the election was not about cryptocurrencies. He mentioned that his predecessor, Jay Clayton, who will serve in the new Trump administration, brought up 80 cases during his past tenure. It seems that Gensler is hinting that the new administration is not going to tolerate lawbreakers, no matter how pro-crypto it is. Gensler’s epitome: cryptos are securities. Period Sorkin pointed out that Gensler, during his tenure, has been battling crypto companies, leaning on the existing laws while not working on creating the laws that would have factored the changing reality in. This question is really genuine as Gensler is known as a person who tends to equate most cryptocurrencies to unregistered securities, which is a very uncomfortable way to perceive crypto for crypto companies. Instead of pushing the new rules to efficiently regulate crypto, Gensler was trying to shove crypto into an already existing law configuration, no matter how inadequate it is for crypto. Mostly, these laws were not created with cryptocurrencies in mind and mostly predating their vast presence. Gensler insists that most cryptocurrency projects must adhere to the laws regulating securities, and in many instances, they fail to comply. Despite the initial interest in Bitcoin , the SEC-era Gensler doesn’t see crypto as something that never existed before and sticks to his guns, repeating a “cryptos are nothing but unregistered securities” mantra. Answering Sorkin’s question, he said crypto is mostly traded leaning on the sentiment and not fundamentals, but if (sic!) the fundamentals are there, crypto companies should make disclosures adhering to the securities laws. Bitcoin is not a security, but other cryptocurrencies are dangerous Gensler said that Bitcoin is not a security now (sic!), but other thousands of cryptocurrencies pose a threat to the investing public, and it’s his duty as a law enforcement agent to protect these people from fraud, money laundering and other crimes. “There has been too much of that in this field,” Gensler said. More than that, he is sure that the exchanges are “trading against their customers.” As for Bitcoin, Gensler compared the first cryptocurrency to gold and noted that it is a highly volatile speculative asset, but people want to trade it. However, Gensler said he cannot predict the future of Bitcoin, and he doesn’t know whether it will have any value in 10 or 20 years from now. Sorkin said that Gensler’s attempts to fight Bitcoin were in vain as at the end of Gensler’s era, Bitcoin was as popular as never before. At the same time, Gensler failed to prevent this great bubble from blowing (if it proved to be a bubble). Twice, Gensler dodged to comment on how he feels about his role in both of these scenarios, none of which portrays him as a winner. Listing his main achievements as the SEC chair, he mentioned reforms in the stock market policy and other sectors not related to cryptocurrencies. Afterword It is interesting how Gary Gensler went from a tech-savvy official genuinely intrigued by the potential of blockchain technology to a rigid gatekeeper in just two years. In 2019, he wrote an inspired editorial on the future of Bitcoin for CoinDesk. In 2021, he became the most notorious cryptocurrency foe in SEC history. A person who famously called stablecoins “poker chips” for gambling, he dedicated his time in the SEC to legal battles with Binance, Coinbase, Ripple, and Gemini while overlooking the FTX collapse. Hopefully, now that he is retiring, he will find peace. He says he never owned any cryptocurrencies. Who knows what’s next for Gensler, will he soften his heart to Bitcoin?

Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, commented on the event with a bold statement on social media. Alderoty suggested that starting Saturday, Gensler would no longer hold relevance in discussions surrounding the US SEC. Gary Gensler’s Last Day as US SEC Chair: Ripple CLO Alderoty Comments In a post on X , Stuart Alderoty, Ripple CLO, mocked Gary Gensler’s departure from the SEC. He remarked that the crypto industry would soon ask, “Gary who?” Alderoty’s comments come amidst Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC, which began in 2020. The SEC has alleged that Ripple sold XRP as an unregistered security, a claim the company has denied. Despite the XRP company’s partial court victory in 2023, where the judge ruled that XRP sales to retail investors did not violate securities laws. However, the US SEC appealed the decision prolonging uncertainty for Ripple and the crypto industry. In recent reports on the XRP lawsuit , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an appeal challenging the district court’s 2023 ruling that XRP is not a security. The SEC argues that all XRP transactions, including programmatic sales to retail investors, qualify as investment contracts under the Howey Test. Gary Gensler’s legacy as SEC Chair is marked by an aggressive approach to regulating the crypto industry. Under his leadership, the SEC initiated over 80 lawsuits against crypto companies, including prominent names such as Coinbase, Uniswap, and Ripple. Despite the controversies, Gensler claimed that crypto enforcement accounted for only a small portion of the SEC’s overall activities. Supporters of his tenure highlighted efforts to protect investors and enforce compliance across the financial sector. The former US SEC chair shared a video on X, reflecting on the four years in office. It has been the privilege of a lifetime to work for you as @SECGov Chair.

Analysts noted the formation of a bullish pennant pattern on XRP’s weekly price chart. The pattern, often indicative of strong upward momentum, has led some analysts to forecast a potential short-term target of $10. Source: TradingView The bullish outlook is boosted by improved market sentiment surrounding Ripple’s chances in its legal battle with the SEC. Market participants remain optimistic about the possibility of reduced regulatory pressure under the Trump administration. Additionally, recent price analysis supports the bullish outlook for XRP , with targets of $5, $10, $15, and $20 in sight. The ongoing rally is fueled by strong technical patterns like the “bull flag” and increased open interest, which recently hit $7.51 billion. Whale accumulation has also intensified, indicating growing investor confidence. Anticipation Grows for XRP ETF Approval More so analysts at JPMorgan broke silence on XRP ETF possibilities, forecasting an inflow of $3 billion to $8 billion if approved by the SEC. The prediction is based on adoption rates similar to BTC and Ether ETFs, which captured 6% and 3% of their market caps, respectively, within their early months. The report highlights the potential for XRP and Solana ETFs to boost liquidity and market adoption. At press time, the Ripple token is trading at $3.27, marking a 39.71% gain over the past 7 days. The cryptocurrency’s market cap stands at $188.16 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $13.8 billion.

The San Francisco-based blockchain company Ripple is marking the occasion with enthusiasm. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief legal officer, took to social media, remarking , “Starting tomorrow, ‘Gary who?’ will be the only appropriate response if someone mentions his name. Onward.” Gesler’s aggressive stance The SEC filed its opening brief in the appeal of its ongoing lawsuit with Ripple earlier this week. The case in question was based on the perceived nature of XRP as a security and has been widely discussed in the cryptocurrency industry. Ripple, however, appears unfazed. Alderoty called the latest legal action “noise,” suggesting that the SEC’s new leadership could adopt a new approach. He also noted that the case could be deferred, as there were reports that certain cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions without fraud claims could be suspended. The appeal comes as the SEC, under Gensler, has been accused of being overly aggressive in the legal arena by many industry participants. Ripple’s lawyer, John Deaton, who is actively involved in the case against the SEC, has also slammed Gensler for his leadership.

Deaton, however, said that there may be changes under the new chair, Paul Atkins, who is a nominee of President-elect Donald Trump. Akins is expected to pause some activities against cryptocurrency companies, which will be favourable to Ripple. According to the reports, the SEC under Atkins intends to allow more cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Analysts predict that the probability of the approval of an XRP ETF in 2025 is 66% which could lead to over $8 billion of inflows. Gensler became the SEC chairman in 2021, and there were high hopes that he would be more receptive to cryptocurrencies due to his experience teaching blockchain and crypto at MIT. At first, some people in the industry, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, applauded his appointment. However, his time in the role has been marked by controversy, as the SEC has sued numerous major crypto firms. It has been the privilege of a lifetime to work for you as @SECGov Chair.

He called his four years at the helm of the SEC “the privilege of a lifetime.” Trump administration and XRP surge The regulatory landscape could see a major change under President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to fire Gensler and adopt more lax market rules. Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse has been constantly in touch with the new administration and reportedly had a meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago this month. According to reports, Garlinghouse proposed the concept of a federal crypto reserve that would include XRP and Bitcoin. However, Ripple has not confirmed these discussions. Despite the prevailing legal ambiguities, XRP has given impressive results. The cryptocurrency recently spiked to $3.23, coming close to its previous record of $3.40 set in 2018. In the past week alone, XRP has jumped by more than 40%, with higher-value transactions and the number of holders on the rise. Currently, XRP is trading at $3.28, having risen by 2% in the last 24 hours. According to Analytics firm Santiment, there were 2,365 XRP transactions worth more than $100,000 within a day for eight hours. Also, over 500,000 new XRP wallets have been created in the last two months, which speaks about the continuing interest in the token. 📈 XRP has just reached a new 7-year high, crossing a $3.39 market value for the first time since January, 2018.

These programs provide returns in the form of three cryptocurrencies associated with Nova Labs: Helium Network Token (HNT) Helium Mobile Network Token (MOBILE) Helium IoT Network Token (IOT) The SEC alleges that these activities qualify as unregistered securities offerings and violate federal securities regulations that require issuers to disclose important financial and operational details to protect investors.

XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have established themselves as top contenders, but a new player, Lightchain AI, is quickly emerging as a project that could outpace them all. Currently priced at $0.00525 and having raised over $10.6 million during its presale, Lightchain AI, is attracting significant attention from investors looking for high-growth opportunities. XRP strengths and challenges Traditional international transactions often take several days to complete, with high fees due to multiple intermediaries. In contrast, Ripple’s system enables near-instant transfers, reducing wait times to mere seconds. This speed is achieved by using XRP as a bridge currency, simplifying exchanges and eliminating the need for pre-funded accounts. However, challenges remain, particularly around regulatory scrutiny from agencies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has cast uncertainty on XRP’s classification and future role in financial systems. Although Ripple’s network has expanded, its widespread adoption by conventional banks is still a work in progress. Addressing these issues is crucial for Ripple to solidify XRP’s position in transforming global money transfers.

In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 23:50:00

The SEC accused DCG and Genesis of defrauding investors through misrepresentation, resulting in penalties and legal action. DCG agreed to settle the charges by paying a $38 million fine. SEC Reveals Accounting Tricks Behind DCG’s ‘Strong’ Balance Sheet Claims On January 17, the SEC ordered DCG to pay a $38 million civil penalty and issued a cease-and-desist order to prevent future misconduct. The charges extend to DCG and its former CEO, Soichiro “Michael” Moro, who allegedly misled investors about the financial health of Genesis following the collapse of one of its largest borrowers, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), in mid-2022. The U.S. SEC has charged Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its subsidiary Genesis Global Capital for allegedly concealing significant financial risks arising from the default of Three Arrows Capital in 2022 by disseminating false or misleading information. DCG has been fined $38… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 17, 2025 Moro, who served as CEO of Genesis during this period, was accused of approving misleading public statements and tweets that downplayed financial risks. According to the SEC, Moro authorized posts claiming that Genesis had “shed the risk” associated with 3AC’s default and maintained a “strong” balance sheet, despite the company’s precarious position. Additionally, Moro signed a $1.1 billion promissory note on behalf of Genesis, which the SEC described as perpetuating a false narrative about the company’s financial health. As part of the enforcement action, Moro was fined $500,000 and barred from engaging in any negligent conduct that could mislead investors. The SEC indicated that its findings against Moro could support ongoing investor lawsuits and regulatory actions. The SEC also revealed that DCG executives were aware of over $1 billion in losses at Genesis but sought to portray financial stability. DCG issued a $1.1 billion promissory note to Genesis, described by the SEC as an “accounting asset” with no tangible capital transfer. These actions, coupled with undisclosed terms of the note, misled investors about the company’s true financial state. By June 30, 2022, Genesis reported positive equity, but the company’s financial pressures continued to mount. By November 2022, it suspended withdrawals, affecting customers of Gemini Earn and locking up $900 million in user assets. Genesis and DCG Struggle with Fallout from 2022 Collapse The financial troubles of Genesis began with the collapse of 3AC, which triggered liquidity issues, and worsened with the implosion of FTX later that year. In January 2023, Genesis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy , disclosing over $3.5 billion in debts to its top 50 creditors, including major names like Gemini and VanEck. Genesis’ parent company, DCG, borrowed $500 million across four loans in 2022. However, by May 2023, DCG had failed to repay $620 million, including 4,550 Bitcoin, prompting Genesis to file a lawsuit seeking full repayment plus fees. You might also like Genesis Sues Parent Firm DCG Over $600 Million Loan Repayment In November 2023, DCG reached a settlement to repay the loans by April 2024, offering Genesis some relief in its bankruptcy proceedings. By February 2024, Genesis and Gemini had reached a settlement to distribute $1.8 billion to users of Gemini Earn, pending court approval. By May 2024, Genesis had distributed $2.18 billion worth of cryptocurrency to approximately 232,000 users, advancing its bankruptcy process. Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is pursuing penalties and corrective measures against Gemini Trust, with its trial now set for January 21, 2025. This legal battle adds to the ongoing scrutiny faced by companies tied to DCG and Genesis.

In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, Filbfilb shared insights on Bitcoin’s trajectory amid a recovering market and incoming political changes in the U.S. Trump Administration and Bitcoin Market Dynamics After rebounding from two-month lows, Bitcoin is trading above $100,000 as of Jan. 17, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView data. Filbfilb believes the Trump administration’s pro-Bitcoin stance could boost the market. However, potential trade wars could disrupt the broader risk-asset rally. Despite these uncertainties, Filbfilb predicts Bitcoin will maintain its leadership in the crypto market, possibly achieving record dominance. He remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s ability to outperform equities if favorable policies are enacted quickly. Short-Term Expectations and Market Reactions In response to potential unmet expectations regarding executive orders, Filbfilb said, “I had anticipated a bumpy open to the year with a recovery in the second part of the month, which is what we have seen so far.” While Bitcoin’s current price reflects cautious optimism, he noted, “If something like this is ruled out, I’m sure there would be a dip, but probably an overreaction and perhaps an opportunity.” MicroStrategy and Bitcoin Correlation Discussing MicroStrategy’s stock performance, Filbfilb dismissed claims of it being a “ponzi scheme” but acknowledged its risks. “At present, the premium over net asset value (NAV) is around 2, similar to levels seen when Bitcoin consolidated around $60,000-$70,000,” he explained. If Bitcoin surpasses $100,000, he expects MicroStrategy’s stock to surge, driven by increased interest in Bitcoin. “Short term, I’m not too concerned about a major retracement for MSTR, unless there is a big pullback in Bitcoin,” he added. Long-term concerns about MicroStrategy’s debt servicing are noted but remain a topic for the future.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 23:59:00

For savvy investors, now is the time to stay ahead of the curve. Indeed, there has been news about the Dogecoin price reaching new heights. However, altcoins like WallitIQ (WLTQ) , Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Myro (MYRO) have entered the market with the life-changing potential of turning your $550 into $550,000. Keep reading to understand why these four altcoins are set to skyrocket before the Dogecoin price hits $1. Stock Market Genius Confirms That WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Rise By 1,000x And Dominate The Crypto Market In 2025 WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) upcoming 1,000x rise proves one thing — it is a financial revolution, not just another altcoin. This crypto uses artificial intelligence to make your trading experience convenient. You can trade up to 1,000 cryptocurrencies from one wallet. Priced at just $0.0420 , buying as little as $550 worth of the token now will bring you a whopping $550,000 in returns shortly. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) intuitive Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App has been designed to streamline your wallet and transaction management. There are display QR codes for wallet addresses to receive payments easily. You get access to live market data because of the CoinGecko API integration. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) transaction features include simulated crypto transfers for day-to-day purchases like Starbucks coffee subscriptions.

With its staking rewards of up to 180% APY , you can earn passive income by simply holding WallitIQ (WLTQ). Even the Dogecoin price that stands above WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) $0.0420 cannot compete with this feature. Safety is paramount to crypto investment, and this altcoin delivers. SolidProof has completed WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) smart contract audit to secure your investment. This altcoin’s robust security and growing community contributed to it crossing the one-million-dollar mark just weeks after the presale started. Timing is everything in the crypto world.

Pepe (PEPE) recently broke out of an ascending triangle pattern, which signals a further upside. Pepe’s (PEPE) RSI points to buying pressure, and experts speculate Pepe (PEPE) might achieve exponential gains before the Dogecoin price hits $1. Bonk (BONK) Signals A Potential Breakout Following Its Recent Rally Following its rally that peaked in Q4 last year, Bonk (BONK) has entered a corrective phase. If Bonk (BONK) holds this support and breaks above the wedge resistance, it might experience a breakout. Thus, speculative upward movement in Bonk (BONK) is expected to outpace the Dogecoin price to $1. However, failure to hold this support could lead to a deeper correction for Bonk (BONK). Experts Say Myro (MYRO) Can Deliver 30x Returns In 2025 Currently trading between $0.0618 and $0.0966, Myro (MYRO) shows resilience despite its 13% dip last month. Myro (MYRO) has had a solid 14% growth in the past six months, and it positioned close to its 10-day simple moving average of $0.1491, showing a 55% surge in Myro (MYRO). If Myro (MYRO) maintains this trajectory, it can surpass the Dogecoin price to deliver 30x returns this year. Conclusion Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Myro (MYRO) are showing signs of impressive growth. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is set to dominate all of them with its 1,000x rally. As such, it is understandable that a stock market genius is lauding its potential and credibility. Time is ticking, and the presale is the only chance you have to secure this altcoin at just $0.0420 . Do not waste one more second!

According to insights from Dom (@traderview2), an experienced overflow, volume, and profile trader, this rally diverges from the typical behavior observed in Bitcoin and other assets. It signals genuine demand for the token rather than speculative trading, offering a promising outlook for XRP and the broader market. This demand has been reflected in XRP’s price, as the digital asset recently climbed to $3.39, its highest price since 2018. In a series of analyses supported by technical charts, Dom emphasizes the importance of the spot premium and funding rates remaining unchanged despite the recent upward price movement. “This rally continues to be driven entirely by spot buying,” Dom stated, highlighting the uniqueness of this XRP movement compared to Bitcoin’s often futures-led price surges. It’s absolutely insane to see that $XRP funding rates and spot premium still haven’t moved This rally continues to be driven entirely by spot buying (see 2nd pic), this proves real demand for actual coins This isn’t just another perp-led rally like we always see with $BTC … https://t.co/cMpxOisv76 pic.twitter.com/7bUzGC2eo8 — Dom (@traderview2) January 15, 2025 Real Demand Fuels XRP Growth The charts highlight robust buying pressure on XRP’s spot market, which indicates real demand for the cryptocurrency. This is a notable departure from the behavior of perpetual swaps or leveraged trading, where funding rates typically spike as traders speculate on price movements. In XRP’s case, the absence of significant changes in funding rates reinforces the notion that this rally is backed by buyers seeking actual tokens rather than short-term profits. The significance of this development also extends beyond XRP. XRP has been displaying unusual signs in its price surges, and a market rally driven by spot purchases often reflects increased confidence in the asset, signaling a broader shift in sentiment among investors. Such trends are critical in fostering long-term growth and stability for cryptocurrencies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What’s Next For the Market and XRP XRP’s spot-led rally marks a pivotal moment for the token and the cryptocurrency industry. It serves as an indicator of shifting market dynamics, where speculative futures trading plays a lesser role in driving asset value. This move may attract more institutional and retail investors, offering them confidence in XRP’s utility and resilience. For XRP specifically, this momentum could be linked to the shift in the U.S. political landscape after Donald Trump’s election victory in November, and the excitement surrounding the upcoming resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Increasing adoption and utility in cross-border payments and blockchain solutions also play a significant role, as the token’s role in facilitating efficient and cost-effective transactions has been a key value proposition for years. Dom concludes that this trend could signify much higher price levels for XRP. “If I saw this with BTC, I would simply say we are going much higher,” Dom noted, suggesting that the rally may be far from over.

Its trading volume is also up by 10.58%, reflecting strong market interest. Launched in November 2023, this dog-inspired coin built on Solana has achieved impressive growth in a short time.

It is now trading above $103,000. This marks an 8% gain over the past week, driven by growing interest from large investors and a shift in market dynamics. According to the latest insights from CryptoQuant Analysts, some underlying whale activity factors might be influencing Bitcoin’s current trajectory. Related Reading: Rising Bitcoin Prices Defy Exchange Inflows: What Investors Need to Know Bitcoin Price Rebounds Amid Growing Whale Activity CryptoQuant QuickTake Platform contributor Joao Wedson has recently highlighted a noteworthy trend in whale behavior on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. In a recent analysis, Wedson examined the Exchange Whale Ratio, which measures the share of Bitcoin’s largest inflow transactions relative to the total exchange volume. This metric, according to the analyst has now reached historical highs, signaling that large holders—often referred to as whales—are transferring significant amounts of Bitcoin to the exchange. The increased movement of Bitcoin by whales may indicate that they are preparing for substantial buy or sell actions, potentially amplifying market volatility. Wedson added: Stay alert! Intense movements by major players can bring volatility risks but also unique opportunities for those closely monitoring the market. Understanding New Whale Movements and Market Cycles In addition to whale activity on Binance, another CryptoQuant contributor, KriptoBaykusV2, provided insights into the emergence of new large investors in the market. According to KriptoBaykusV2, the “New Whales” indicator highlights the influx of previously inactive large investors acquiring Bitcoin. Over the past three years, this metric has grown steadily, suggesting heightened interest in the cryptocurrency market. However, the entry and exit of new whales often coincide with price swings, making it a key factor for understanding market cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Target $145,000 To $249,000 Under Trump Administration: Report Historical data shows that peaks in new whale activity often align with periods of price volatility. For example, during 2021 and 2023, sharp increases in the number of new large investors were followed by significant price corrections.

The study, published in the International Journal of Bank Marketing, aims to analyze the influence of social media on investors’ behaviour towards cryptocurrencies. The research done by Kyoung Tae Kim and Lu Fan investigates the connection between time spent on social media and the propensity of people to invest in cryptocurrencies. The study shows that social media significantly influences investment decisions, including risky ones such as cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies remain rather popular, even though they are characterized by high fluctuations. This study demonstrates that social media is one of the key determinants of investors’ perceptions and behaviour. The study also shows that investors who gain their information through social media are likely to invest in cryptocurrencies and view future investment in this area positively. The role of social media platforms One of the key insights of the research is the differential effect of different social media platforms on cryptocurrency investment behaviour. The study revealed that the probability of people investing in cryptocurrency grows with the number of platforms used. Some platforms seem to promote a higher level of confidence when it comes to investing, as conversations regarding cryptocurrency are often enough to sway users. According to one of the researchers, Lu Fan, the discussion surrounding cryptocurrencies has been on the rise, especially with the celebrities on social networks. He notes that many people are motivated by the desire to imitate their friends and relatives or even celebrities who also invest in the same business. Youth and financial literacy The study also shows that there is one significant pattern among young people. This study showed that the younger population is not only the main consumer of social media but also the main investor in cryptocurrencies. However, this group might not be well informed on financial matters, which may make them very sensitive to social media influence. Fan underscores the need for young adults, especially those who lack sufficient experience in handling money, to be well-guided in making the right investment decisions. He points out that while information on social media can be useful, it can also lead to investment decisions made based on hype rather than knowledge of the financial markets. The number of young adults investing in cryptocurrencies is on the rise every day across the globe. According to Bappebti, Indonesia’s commodity futures trading regulatory agency, 62% of Indonesia’s crypto investors were between 18 and 30 years old as of October 2024. This trend is in line with young people from Indonesia investing in cryptocurrencies, with 26.9% of investors being 18-24 years old and 35.1% being 25-30 years old. According to a study from Bitget Research, Generation Z and the Millennial generation are becoming more interested in cryptocurrencies. The research further found that 20% of Gen Z is the most targeted group of crypto scams. However, this group is still interested in crypto and its opportunities, especially as a means of payment. Cryptocurrency adoption This is not a trend that is limited to Asia only, as more and more young people are using cryptocurrencies. Telegram-based crypto communities in Africa expanded by 189% from the beginning of 2023 to 2024, and over 56% of its users are below 25 years old. Young people in Europe are also participating, with 32% of Millennials and 29% of Gen Z investing in cryptocurrencies, according to a 2024 study by Bitpanda and YouGov. Cryptocurrency adoption is also increasing at a faster rate than both mobile phones and the internet worldwide. According to BlackRock’s Jay Jacobs, mobile phones took 21 years and the internet 15 years to garner 300 million users, while cryptocurrencies reached the same number in just 12 years. Bitcoin stands out with a $2 trillion market cap and still leads the industry as the demand for decentralized assets grows in a digital economy.

The New York Post, citing anonymous sources, reports that Trump is “receptive” to the idea of a national strategic reserve with Solana, XRP and the stablecoin USDC . All three assets were developed in association with blockchain projects that are headquartered in the US. Trump met with Ripple’s chief executive Brad Garlinghouse and chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty last week.

As Ethereum struggles, ETH Whales are dumping their ETH and turning to PropiChain (PCHAIN) , an AI altcoin defying the bearish market trend. PCHAIN has surged from $0.004 to $0.011, drawing comparisons with Ethereum’s early rise. Experts believe PropiChain’s innovative DeFi solutions could rival Ethereum, with some predicting a price above $2 by 2025. Ethereum Whales are looking to capitalize on PCHAIN’s growth potential as it gains traction among top AI altcoins. Ethereum Decline Gets Steeper, the Drop Could Continue Ethereum price has dropped 19.16% over the last 30 days, with ETH now testing the $3,000 support level. This marks the first time since November 2024 that Ethereum has fallen this low. While 74.7% of Ethereum addresses belong to long-term holders, signaling commitment, many are eager for a market rebound. Despite the bullish Ethereum price prediction, the charts suggest ETH could see further declines, possibly reaching $2,800 or even $2,569 before any upward movement occurs. Ethereum remains unpredictable, but ETH Whales are hoping things will get better. PropiChain’s Crypto Presale: A Golden Opportunity for ETH Whales PropiChain’s crypto presale is rapidly gaining attention, particularly among ETH whales looking for new opportunities. In its second stage, tokens are priced at $0.011, making it a prime entry point for early investors. The presale has already raised nearly $2 million, with 45.14% of the tokens sold in stage 2, highlighting the growing demand for this emerging AI altcoin. The project has earned additional credibility through a thorough security audit by BlockAudit and a listing on CoinMarketCap . These milestones reinforce PropiChain’s position as a transparent and trustworthy investment. PropiChain is drawing increasing interest as an AI altcoin because of its potential to disrupt the crypto landscape and offer long-term growth opportunities. PropiChain’s Vision: A Blending AI Innovation and RWA Tokenomics PropiChain is revolutionizing the real estate industry by integrating blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI). This innovative approach addresses the challenges of high capital requirements and illiquidity in traditional real estate markets. By blending AI with blockchain, PropiChain enhances property management, trading, and investment processes, offering investors a more efficient and accessible platform. A standout feature of this AI altcoin is its fractional ownership model. Through tokenization, investors can own a portion of high-value properties without substantial upfront capital. This democratizes access to real estate investments, allowing individuals to participate in the market with lower financial barriers. Such a model can transform the real estate sector, making it more inclusive and liquid, thus drawing the Ethereum Whales. In addition to fractional ownership, PropiChain is embracing the metaverse to create immersive digital experiences. Users can virtually explore properties, attend interactive conferences, and connect with other investors in a fully immersive digital space. This metaverse integration enhances user engagement and provides a novel way to interact with real estate assets, aligning with the growing trend of virtual environments in various industries. Furthermore, this AI altcoin’s AI integration offers advanced tools for intelligent decision-making. The platform provides actionable insights, evaluates properties, and identifies emerging market trends, simplifying the complexities of investing. By utilizing AI, this AI altcoin empowers investors with accurate, up-to-date information tailored to their goals, enhancing the overall investment experience. PropiChain Presale: Why ETH Whales are Shifting The recent dip in the Ethereum price has left some ETH Whales cautious, but it has opened up a prime opportunity to invest in emerging AI altcoins like PropiChain. With a presale price of $0.011 and almost $2 million already raised, PCHAIN AI altcoin is demonstrating its real potential in the crypto space. Based on an 800% surge by listing, an investment of $2000 today could yield approximately $376,364 at the projected price of $0.23 in phase 3. As Ethereum faces challenges, PropiChain stands out, showcasing the future of crypto in AI altcoins that emphasize innovation, accessibility, and practical value. Don’t miss out on this chance.

Chicago-based business owner Milan Jackson says it all started when she received a phone call from someone who claimed to work at the bank, reports ABC 7. The man on the phone said someone was trying to take $20,000 from Jackson’s account, warning she needed to act fast to stop the transfer. Jackson says the man’s phone number matched the number on the back of her BofA debit card, which made the call seem legitimate. The imposter told Jackson to protect her money by wiring $20,000 to a different account, and soon after the transaction was sent she began to realize something was wrong. “I get this weird feeling, and so I go into Bank of America, and they confirm that this is a scam. I shut the phone off. I’m hysterically crying… I can’t believe this is my life. How did this happen and how am I going to get this money back?” The FBI calls this type of theft “the phantom hacker,” and special agent Rachel LaRocque says these types of scams are growing more sophisticated. “They may even be able to spoof that bank’s phone number, so the number on your caller ID or cell phone might show that it’s the bank. Scammers do not discriminate against anyone. They want money from anyone they can take it from.” In cases like these, Bank of America says it tries to claw back funds but is not responsible for the theft. The bank says it will never call customers and ask them to send money or a wire transfer.

Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) could become the next viral memecoin. Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) by entering its contract address – GmW5qPRZ4TfoTw6U1KL9Btxn1uqXJJhieMAfeJk4wkbg – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-18 01:12:00

Bitcoin (BTC) still leads the charge, but altcoins are capturing attention. From Ethereum (ETH) to the dynamic BigBossInu, these digital currencies are ready to thrive as market momentum builds. BigBossInu: Leading the Crypto Revolution with Its Explosive Presale BigBossInu is revolutionizing the crypto market, with its presale attracting significant investor interest and generating major excitement. Positioned as a high-reward opportunity, it offers early investors a strategic advantage to secure exceptional rewards. With a visionary roadmap and cutting-edge features, BigBossInu is quickly becoming one of the hottest cryptos to follow, creating waves in the space with ambitious growth plans. BIGBOSSINU celebrates $100,000 raised within minutes! For a l imited time , get a 50% EXTRA BONUS by using the code EXTRA50X . Don’t miss out! >> Ethereum (ETH) : Ethereum’s price has seen gains recently, closely following the U.S. stock market indexes hitting record highs. Despite a sideways consolidation over the past week, ETH is approaching the final phase of a bullish fractal pattern, which could lead to a 40% increase in price if confirmed. Solana (SOL) : Solana is eyeing a long-term price target of $600, potentially riding the broader crypto bull run led by Bitcoin. The network has seen significant growth in its ecosystem, including a new all-time high in liquid staking above $5.7 billion and an increase in average daily transaction volumes for NFTs and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Optimism (OP) : Generally, Optimism’s price is tied to its progress in scaling Ethereum and the adoption of layer-2 solutions, which help in reducing transaction costs and increasing throughput for the Ethereum blockchain. Litecoin (LTC) : Historically, LTC’s performance often moves in tandem with Bitcoin, acting as a “digital silver.” Litecoin is still relevant for payments due to its faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to Bitcoin. >> Conclusion With the crypto market gearing up for a rally, altcoins like BigBossInu, Ethereum, Solana, Optimism, and Litecoin offer significant opportunities for growth by 2025. BigBossInu’s presale, Ethereum’s bullish signals, Solana’s expanding ecosystem, Optimism’s layer-2 adoption, and Litecoin’s payment strength highlight their potential. These assets could help build a substantial portfolio, but thorough research and risk management are essential in navigating the volatile market.

Republican Senator Peter Durant of Worcester County has introduced legislation to create a “Commonwealth Bitcoin Strategic Reserve.” This proposal marks a pivotal shift for a state traditionally known as a Democratic stronghold. Massachusetts Targets BTC Adoption With Strategic Reserve Proposal State Senator Peter Durant has filed a bill advocating for the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve. The proposed “Commonwealth Bitcoin Strategic Reserve” aims to allocate up to 10% of the state’s $9 billion stabilization fund toward Bitcoin and other digital assets. The legislation specifies that funds used for the reserve must be unspent, uncommitted, or unencumbered, ensuring no interference with existing financial obligations. Senator Durant emphasized that the reserve would not replace traditional investments but act as a supplementary strategy. Additionally, the proposed reserve offers flexibility by permitting the state treasury to loan Bitcoin and other assets under its control. This provision will generate additional returns while maintaining a balanced financial risk profile. More so, the Massachusetts bill permits the use of qualified custodians or exchange-traded products (ETPs) to achieve these digital assets. The move is in line with the trend that has been realized in the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a form of conducting business. Bitcoin adoption has been steadily growing, with increasing interest from major companies. Recently, MicroStrategy, one of the biggest institutional Bitcoin investors, unveiled plans to further enhance its Bitcoin strategy . The company suggested raising its Class A share capital to 10.3 billion in order to obtain more BTC. Implications of the Bitcoin Reserve Strategy Massachusetts joins other U.S. states, such as Texas and Pennsylvania, in considering Bitcoin reserves. At the federal level, there are discussions about including digital assets in national reserves under the incoming Trump administration. These initiatives highlight the increasing recognition of Bitcoin’s role in financial strategies across the nation. The Massachusetts bill also reflects a larger trend in cryptocurrency adoption, with countries like Hong Kong and Germany exploring similar reserves. Additionally, a recent report revealed Wyoming’s proposal to invest state funds in Bitcoin through House Bill 0201 (HB0201). This bill will allocate up to 3% of qualifying state funds to Bitcoin investments, including direct purchases and regulated Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs). The proposal builds on Wyoming’s track record of enacting over two dozen blockchain-friendly laws since 2018. Meanwhile, crypto industry leaders are optimistic that Donald Trump will announce a strategic Bitcoin reserve on his inauguration day, January 20. They believe this move could set a precedent, encouraging other nations to explore Bitcoin reserves as part of their financial strategies.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing 5 altcoins with the potential to outshine Bitcoin’s recent rally. Table of Contents XYZ to take the meme coin championship Cardano BNB Ethereum XRP Conclusion Bitcoin’s recent surge is capturing attention, but other cryptocurrencies might offer even greater rewards. Five altcoins are poised to outperform Bitcoin’s rally, and this article uncovers these rising stars. XYZ to take the meme coin championship XYZ is stepping into the crypto ring, delivering KO punches to scam projects, farming flops, and low-value tokens. As the first-ever sports-focused meme coin, it’s blazing through the market like a true champion, setting its sights on a 75x growth. XYZ is redefining the game with XYZVerse by blending sports excitement with meme-driven energy. Packed with entertainment-focused dApps, XYZ is pulling millions of sports fans into the fold, creating a winning combination of sports hype and crypto innovation. XYZ is gearing up to dominate the GameFi scene, potentially delivering even bigger wins to its stakeholders through the perfect fusion of meme power, sports passion, and crypto adoption. Missed out on BOME’s 5,000% rally or WIF’s 1,000% surge? XYZ is primed to leave those gains in the dust. Positioned to surge over 7,400% by TGE, it’s poised to become the GOAT of meme coins. XYZVerse isn’t just a platform — it’s a movement. By empowering its community to steer the project, XYZ will reward active contributors with exclusive airdropped tokens. With string tokenomics, planned CEX/DEX listings, and continuous token burns, XYZ is primed for a championship run, ensuring a positive price trajectory and an engaged, thriving community. Interested investors can join the XYZ presale for its 9,900% knockout opportunity. You might also like: XYZVerse could be the second chance for those who missed Bitcoin Cardano Cardano recently rebounded above $1, signaling renewed bullish momentum as the broader crypto market experiences a surge. The crypto is currently trading at $1.13, with a 24-hour increase of around 3%. Notably, analysts highlight that ADA is currently trading within a pennant pattern. With the pennant’s upper resistance and lower support lines converging, a breakout appears imminent. If ADA breaches the nearest resistance level at $1.50, it could target a price of $1.74, marking a substantial gain from its current levels and further solidifying its position in the market. BNB BNB is trading at $717, confined within an uptrend line and the $745 overhead resistance. Analysts suggest that while bulls may attempt to breach the $745 level, it could act as a strong barrier. A sharp rejection at this resistance might drive the BNB/USDT pair toward its moving averages. However, a strong rebound from the moving averages could enhance the chances of a breakout above $745, potentially propelling the price to $794. A bearish turn with a break below the uptrend line would invalidate this positive outlook and signal further downside risks. You might also like: XYZVerse aims to outpace DOGE and SHIB with 15,000% growth Ethereum Ethereum was trading at $3,466 at the time of writing, denoting an increase of 3.43% in 24 hours and 6.61% in the past week. Ethereum’s recovery to $3,466.67 from the neckline of a head-and-shoulders pattern is encountering resistance in the zone between the moving averages. The 20-day EMA at $3,380 and the RSI near the midpoint indicate a balance between supply and demand. A break and close above $3,745 could shift momentum to buyers, potentially driving the ETH/USDT pair to rally toward $4,094. However, a decline below the neckline may invalidate this bullish outlook, potentially pulling the price down to $2,850, where buyers are expected to reenter. XRP Since the 2024 U.S. election, XRP’s price has surged by 460%, reflecting strong market sentiment. With XRP now gaining significant attention, Messari analyst Sam Ruskin recently suggested it could surpass Ethereum in value soon. This optimism is driven by several factors, including Donald Trump entering office, the buzz around a potential XRP ETF filing, and growing investor interest in “boomer coins” like XRP. Ruskin predicts that these events could lead to a 35-50% price increase for XRP, potentially narrowing the gap with Ethereum’s market capitalization. Conclusion ADA, BNB, ETH, and XRP are promising, but XYZ, the first all-sport meme coin uniting fans, aims for massive growth and could outshine them all.

This burn process involved 9,982,673,247,009.8082 $HTX tokens, with a total value exceeding $22.47 million. The burn was carried out on-chain to ensure transparency, and users can verify the burn details via the transaction hash . For more details on the burn, please read HTX DAO’s official announcement: https://htxdao-1.gitbook.io/announcement-en Achieving Record-Breaking Burn under Updated Mechanism In Q3 2024, HTX DAO made a significant adjustment to its burn mechanism based on feedback from its governance committee and community members. The portion of $HTX tokens previously used for liquidity pledges are now directly burned. This shift is expected to substantially increase burn efficiency and support the long-term value appreciation of $HTX. The latest burn marks the second execution under the updated mechanism. According to statistics, HTX DAO has burned a total of 49.63 trillion $HTX tokens in 2024, with the combined value of pledges and burns reaching approximately $95.22 million. This accomplishment underscores the platform’s dedication to reducing the circulating supply. It also demonstrates HTX DAO’s commitment to fostering stronger community consensus and driving sustainable ecosystem growth. Driving Long-term Growth Through Token Burns As stipulated by the burn mechanism, HTX DAO will burn 50% of HTX’s quarterly revenue in $HTX tokens. This strategy meets the community’s expectations regarding token value management while further solidifying HTX DAO’s credibility and transparency in governance. Regular token burns not only support the development of the $HTX deflationary model but also boosts confidence among community members. By reducing the circulating supply, this mechanism helps balance supply and demand, stabilize market prices, and increase the appeal of holding $HTX for the long term. The HTX DAO Committee has stated that the ongoing implementation of the burn plan will enhance the scarcity of $HTX tokens and, through an improved ecosystem, provide more stable, long-term returns for platform users and investors. Shaping the Future of the Ecosystem Through Community Consensus As platform services continue to improve and the user base grows, the value and impact of HTX DAO’s quarterly burn mechanism will become even more apparent. The next burn is scheduled for April 15, 2025. The burn amount will be determined based on HTX’s revenue in Q1 2025. Since its establishment, HTX DAO has focused on building a user-centric blockchain ecosystem founded on transparency, efficiency, and vitality. Moving forward, HTX DAO will continue engaging with community members to enhance governance mechanisms. Through transparent governance and efficient management, the platform will adopt sustainable growth strategies to create long-term value for users and communities. HTX DAO looks forward to collaborating with ecosystem partners and global users to build a more stable, open, and dynamic blockchain environment.

However, altcoin investors are turning to crypto AI agents like Propichain (PCHAIN) which offers affordable inroads to the housing sector. Read on to see why Propichain might become the next top crypto AI asset. Analysts Say Solana and Ethereum Could Lead the Next Altcoin Season Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) holders are looking forward to a strong recovery after recent expert predictions for the altcoin market. Many top crypto assets have faced price declines over the past few weeks as Bitcoin has struggled to return to the $100k region. While Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have faced similar price corrections, analysts say both tokens could spark the next altcoin boom. Solana currently trades at $187.35 after a 4.93% decline in the past week. Ethereum also sells at $3,244.74, with a 2.63% decline over the same period. Despite this drop, analysts expect Solana and Ethereum to lead the altcoin recovery. Both tokens have strong DeFi ecosystems backed by high trading activity. Furthermore, if Bitcoin returns to $100k before February, this could further propel a strong price increase for Solana and Ethereum. Bitcoin’s price movement often sets the tone for the broader crypto market, impacting altcoin performance, including Solana and Ethereum. Propichain: Using AI Agents to Expand Profit Opportunities in the Housing Sector The altcoin ecosystem is gearing up for another major entry with the upcoming launch of Propichain (PCHAIN). Built on Ethereum, Propichain is a 21st-century answer to problems that have always plagued the housing sector. Propichain pulls together asset tokenization, artificial intelligence, and metaverse technology, creating an ecosystem where investors of all budget sizes can find profitable investing opportunities. Propichain’s (PCHAIN) asset tokenization reduces the financial costs of becoming a real estate investor. Many willing participants are discouraged by the significantly high capital requirements. Propichain’s fractional ownership model reduces capital barriers, empowering users to invest in smaller shares rather than entire properties. Imagine owning a slice of your dream property without breaking the bank, thanks to Propichain’s revolutionary approach to real estate investing. Propichain follows up its reduced investing costs with streamlined investing tools that leverage artificial intelligence technology. These AI-backed tools help investors with market analysis, asset valuation, and trend-setting. This helps investors to save time while receiving quality market data that helps them spot and seize emerging opportunities. Propichain’s AI-powered tools streamline investing via customizable search filters that enable users to identify high-ROI assets efficiently. As a Propichain (PCHAIN) user, you can also explore its automated trading features, closing deals via buy or sell orders that execute based on orders you set. With automated trading, you enjoy higher investing efficiency as you can close deals without a hands-on approach to participating in the housing market. Propichain simplifies investing with AI tools and enhances it with metaverse-powered virtual tours, allowing users to explore properties anywhere in the world. These virtual tours give a 3D view of your desired asset, giving you a clear picture of whether properties meet your taste or not. After exploring properties through immersive virtual tours, users can finalize deals effortlessly using Propichain’s secure smart contracts. These smart contracts can also be used to create specialized contracts for rental and leasing purposes. As a result, investors will enjoy higher efficiency in such housing deals. Finally, investors don’t have to worry about safety as Propichain’s smart contracts have been audited by BlockAudit, showing that its ecosystem has all it takes to keep users safe. Propichain’s Crypto AI Ecosystem Or Solana: Which Offers Better Returns? With these innovative tools revolutionizing housing investments, analysts are already comparing Propichain (PCHAIN) to industry leaders like Solana. Unlike Solana, which focuses on general blockchain scalability, Propichain specifically targets real estate investment barriers, offering tailored tools for property tokenization and immersive exploration. Propichain has also been listed on the prestigious CoinMarketCap, leading analysts to conclude that it could emerge as one of the top altcoin assets of 2025. These analysts also conclude that buying $1,000 worth of PCHAIN could be a great move that could grow to $100,000 by the end of the year. Propichain’s Ongoing Presale: Secure Your Spot Today Given its unique offerings, Propichain’s ongoing presale presents an attractive entry point for early investors to buy its PCHAIN token while the value is still very low. Many investors have rushed to buy PCHAIN before its expected market boom, leading to the sale of over $2 million in its ongoing presale. PCHAIN now sells at $0.011 after growing by 208.17% from its initial value of $0.004. Now in round two of its presale, PCHAIN is gearing up for a 108.93% rise that will take it to $0.023 by round three of its presale. PCHAIN will also grow to $0.032 by the end of its presale, meaning round one buyers will earn 800% ROI. With its groundbreaking approach to real estate investing, Propichain is not just reshaping the housing market—it’s opening doors to a more inclusive and efficient future. Join the revolution today by participating in its presale.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains a pillar, but altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and the emerging BigBossInu are proving to be the next big opportunities. These are the top cryptocurrencies set to rise before the broader rally gains full speed. BigBossInu is quickly emerging as a force in the crypto market, with its presale drawing significant interest from forward-thinking investors. Seen as a high-reward opportunity, those who get in early could see substantial returns. Backed by cutting-edge technology and a bold growth strategy, BigBossInu is setting the stage for impressive growth. BigBossInu is rewriting the rules for meme coins by pairing its appeal with practical utility. Launching at a presale price of $0.000084, it raised $100,000 in minutes, a testament to investor confidence.

Don’t miss out! >> Cardano (ADA): ADA recently hit a critical support at $0.88, showing a strong rebound from this level, indicating robust buying interest. If bulls can push it above $1.2, ADA could target $1.52 next. However, a failure to maintain above $0.88 may lead to further correction towards $0.50. Chainlink (LINK): LINK is currently trading above its 20-day EMA of $23.63 after a recent dip, with buying interest at lower levels. Bulls are targeting a breakout above $27.39 to retest resistance at $23.06. Bears may still be active at $21.39, which could lead to a drop if they defend that level well. Kaspa (KAS): Kaspa has been gaining traction for its unique proof-of-work mechanism aimed at solving scalability issues, making it a notable player in the blockchain space. Analysts are optimistic about its role in the next crypto bull run as interest in scalable blockchain solutions continues to grow. Arbitrum (ARB): ARB’s performance tends to align with broader market trends, especially in the context of layer-2 solutions aiming to enhance Ethereum’s scalability and efficiency. >> Conclusion As bullish sentiment returns to the crypto market, altcoins like BigBossInu, Cardano, Chainlink, Kaspa, and Arbitrum are attracting attention for their growth potential. BigBossInu’s presale is well-positioned for growth, but investors must proceed cautiously and conduct thorough research in this evolving market.

However, some experts argue that such a target is “too low” for BTC, considering its growing adoption and evolving market dynamics. $150,000 Target Too Low For Bitcoin Crypto trader Alex Becker recently took to X to share his thoughts on Bitcoin’s price momentum. The trader said that although the consensus points to BTC peaking at $150,000 this cycle, he believes that the target is “way too low and way too short.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Primed For A Major Rebound Following ‘Final Capitulation,’ Analyst Predicts Becker argued that at $150,000, Bitcoin’s market capitalization would only represent one-sixth of gold’s, leaving significant room for growth. He described the idea of BTC reaching merely one-sixth of gold’s market cap as “silly low.” At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s total market cap stands at $2.06 trillion. In comparison, gold commands a significantly larger market cap of approximately $18.5 trillion. As for why, the trader noted that unlike past market cycles, things are vastly different for BTC during the current cycle. The top cryptocurrency is poised to benefit from favourable regulations under Donald Trump’s administration, alongside increasing adoption by corporations and sovereign nations as a store of value. Becker projects that, driven by these factors, BTC could peak anywhere between $250,000 and $400,000. His outlook aligns with that of crypto analyst Will Clemente. In a recent post on X, Clemente noted that if a nation adopts Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, it could trigger a domino effect, compelling other countries to follow suit. Clemente elaborated: Once a nation adopts BTC as a strategic reserve asset, it becomes inherently nationalist to DCA into said asset. Then apply this to every nation on Earth that wants to keep its purchasing power simultaneously in game theoretic fashion. BTC Supply Crunch Nearing? As more corporations add Bitcoin to their balance sheets and speculation grows about the potential establishment of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve, the active supply of BTC may come under pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Idea Sparks Cautious Response From Japan PM: Report Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher recently pointed out in an X post that Bitcoin balances on crypto exchanges have hit a fresh seven-year low. Historically, reduced exchange supply correlates with sharp, parabolic price increases for the asset. Other projections estimate BTC could reach a peak of around $200,000 by the summer of 2025. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $103,973, up 5.7% in the past 24 hours.

With the market buzzing and new projects emerging, it’s crucial to identify promising cryptocurrencies before they experience significant growth. One standout is Qubetics ($TICS) , a project addressing real-world issues that previous cryptocurrencies have struggled with. By focusing on practical applications and user-friendly solutions, Qubetics aims to bridge gaps in the current crypto landscape. In this article, we’ll explore Qubetics and two other altcoins that are gaining traction. These projects offer unique features and have the potential for substantial growth. By understanding their applications and recent developments, you can make informed decisions about which top coins to join this month . 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Pioneering Decentralized VPN Technology Qubetics is making waves in the crypto space with its innovative approach to internet privacy through its decentralized VPN (dVPN) application. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralized servers, Qubetics’ dVPN leverages blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer network. This ensures users enjoy secure, private, and unrestricted internet access without the vulnerabilities associated with central points of failure. Imagine you’re a freelance journalist working in a region with strict internet censorship. Using Qubetics’ dVPN, you can bypass these restrictions, accessing information freely and communicating securely with sources worldwide. For businesses, this means safeguarding sensitive data during remote operations, ensuring that proprietary information remains confidential. The excitement doesn’t stop there. The best crypto presale is currently in its 17th stage, with the $TICS token priced at $0.0501. The presale has already raised over $9.7 million, attracting more than 14,700 token holders and selling over 421 million $TICS tokens. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, translating into a 398.73% return on investment (ROI). Looking further ahead, projections suggest $TICS could hit $10 after the mainnet launch in Q2 2025, offering an astounding 19,849.33% ROI. To put this into perspective, if you invest $200 at the current price of $0.0501 per $TICS token, you would acquire approximately 3,992 tokens. If $TICS reaches $10 post-mainnet launch, your investment would be worth about $39,920—a significant return on your initial investment. Why this coin made it to this list: Qubetics stands out for its practical solution to internet privacy concerns and its impressive growth potential, making it one of the top coins to join this month. 2. Solana (SOL): Speed and Scalability Unmatched Solana has quickly emerged as one of the most popular blockchains, thanks to its unparalleled speed and scalability. With the ability to process thousands of transactions per second at minimal cost, Solana is attracting decentralized applications (dApps) and developers seeking efficiency. This high throughput is achieved through its unique consensus mechanism, which combines proof of history (PoH) and proof of stake (PoS). Recently, Solana’s ecosystem has expanded with the introduction of innovative projects and partnerships, further solidifying its position in the market. The network’s native token, SOL, has seen substantial growth, reflecting increased adoption and investor confidence. As of January 2025, SOL is trading at $219.13, with a market capitalization of $106.63 billion. Why this coin made it to this list: Solana’s technological advancements and growing ecosystem position it as a top coin to join this month for those looking to invest in high-performance blockchain platforms. 3. Chainlink (LINK): Bridging Smart Contracts with Real-World Data Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to securely interact with real-world data and external APIs. By providing reliable data feeds, Chainlink enhances the functionality of smart contracts across various blockchains, making it an essential component in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. In recent developments, Chainlink has expanded its services to support more blockchain networks, increasing its utility and adoption. The LINK token has experienced steady growth, reflecting its integral role in the blockchain ecosystem. As of January 2025, LINK is trading at $24.14, with a market capitalization of $12.5 billion. Why this coin made it to this list: Chainlink’s ability to connect smart contracts with real-world data makes it a crucial infrastructure project, earning its spot as a top coin to join this month. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, identifying projects with real-world applications and strong growth potential is key to making informed investment decisions. Qubetics, with its innovative decentralized VPN and impressive presale performance, offers a unique opportunity for investors seeking to join a promising project early. Solana’s unmatched speed and scalability make it a compelling choice for those interested in high-performance blockchains. Chainlink’s role in bridging smart contracts with real-world data solidifies its importance in the DeFi space. Don’t miss out on these top coins to join this month. By staying informed and acting promptly, you can position yourself to benefit from the growth and innovation these projects bring to the cryptocurrency landscape.

The attackers accessed 400 laptop and desktop computers at the department including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s computer, reports Bloomberg, citing two people familiar with the matter. An early investigation has found employee usernames and passwords were accessed, along with at least 3,000 unclassified files. The department’s email and classified systems were not breached and on Yellen’s device, less than 50 files were reportedly accessed. The hackers appeared to be looking for information on sanctions and international affairs. They also accessed data on ongoing investigations at the Committee on Foreign Investment, which is an inter-agency body that reviews foreign investments in US businesses to identify potential national security risks. The Treasury Department reportedly discovered the breach after receiving a warning from BeyondTrust Corp. The access management firm notified the Treasury that its network had been exploited on December 8th.

With his pro-crypto stance widely known, many analysts believe Trump’s presidency could usher in a new era of growth for BTC and the broader cryptocurrency market. This optimism is fueling significant interest among investors, who see the potential for explosive market performance in the coming months. Top analyst Axel Adler recently shared his insights, highlighting that Bitcoin’s market dynamics are firmly in a growth phase. Adler emphasized that BTC’s price action reflects heightened confidence, with institutional and retail investors driving demand as regulatory clarity is expected to improve under Trump’s administration. The $102,000 level marks a pivotal milestone for BTC, showcasing its resilience and increasing appeal as a digital asset. As inauguration day approaches, market participants closely monitor Bitcoin’s next moves, with expectations of continued upward momentum. Analysts predict that Trump’s pro-crypto policies could accelerate adoption, solidify Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation, and trigger a broader rally across the crypto market. With the spotlight on BTC, this bullish momentum could set the tone for a transformative period in the digital asset space. Bitcoin Prepares For A Run Bitcoin is approaching a critical juncture as it eyes a breakout above its local high. If this level is successfully cleared, analysts anticipate a massive rally that could propel BTC into price discovery, where new all-time highs may be set in rapid succession. Investors are particularly optimistic, given that the post-halving year has historically delivered the highest returns for BTC, making this phase crucial for long-term growth. Top analyst Axel Adler from CryptoQuant recently provided key insights into Bitcoin’s current market conditions . Sharing his analysis on X, Adler noted that the BTC market remains firmly in a growth phase, supported by the MVRV Z-Score smoothed with a 180-day moving average. This metric, often used to evaluate market conditions, indicates that Bitcoin’s price has not yet reached extreme overbought levels, leaving room for significant upward movement. As Bitcoin inches closer to reclaiming its all-time highs, the broader crypto market is also showing signs of growth, fueled by increasing investor confidence. Many in the space are eagerly awaiting the inauguration of Donald Trump, who is expected to bring pro-crypto policies that could further enhance Bitcoin’s adoption and price performance. With the stars aligning—historical trends, favorable metrics, and supportive policies—Bitcoin appears poised for a breakout. If it clears this local high and enters price discovery, the next rally could mark a transformative moment in the cryptocurrency’s ongoing evolution. Investors are watching closely, knowing this could be the beginning of an unprecedented surge in the digital asset’s history. BTC Testing Critical Supply Zone Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $102,500, testing a key resistance level set on January 6. This local high has become a critical battleground for bulls and bears, with a decisive break above it likely to fuel significant bullish momentum. Analysts agree that reclaiming and holding this level is essential to unlocking further upside potential. The next major hurdle lies at $103,600, a crucial point that must be surpassed to solidify Bitcoin’s path toward its all-time high (ATH). If BTC clears this resistance, it would mark a critical step toward entering price discovery, a phase where the asset explores uncharted territory with no historical ceiling to limit growth. Such a development would likely trigger heightened market enthusiasm and increased investor activity. Market sentiment remains optimistic as BTC maintains its upward trajectory, supported by strong demand and favorable macroeconomic conditions. Many traders are positioning themselves for a breakout, anticipating that Bitcoin’s ability to reclaim these levels will pave the way for a new era of price appreciation. If bulls succeed in conquering the $103,600 mark, BTC could soon embark on a rally that sets new benchmarks and reinforces its dominance in the cryptocurrency market. The coming days will be pivotal for Bitcoin’s next major move.

Elon Bromance (ELOBRO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOBRO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Bromance by entering its contract address – FY7aYv7K3yEE9Z8hzgURj5z7biTE8Z6BpunBPAnCEpxj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOBRO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-18 02:33:00

Bitcoin (BTC) maintains its position, but altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH) and the promising BigBossInu are climbing the ranks. These digital assets are ready for a dramatic surge. BigBossInu Revolutionizes the Market with Its Game-Changing Presale BigBossInu is blazing a trail in the crypto market, with its groundbreaking presale gaining tremendous momentum among investors. It’s a high-reward opportunity for early movers seeking exponential gains. With an ambitious vision and trailblazing features, BigBossInu is primed to make a big impact. BigBossInu isn’t just another meme—it’s a transformative opportunity in the cryptocurrency world. Combining the excitement of meme culture with solid fundamentals, this project offers something that few others in the space do: high potential returns and a well-defined, deflationary tokenomics model. A growing, passionate community and strategic innovation make it a unique and powerful investment. Celebrate the success with BigBossInu: $100,000 raised in minutes! Enjoy a 50% EXTRA BONUS using code EXTRA50X—limited time offer! >> Uniswap (UNI) : UNI surged by 12% following the announcement of a new Ethereum layer-2 project called “Unichain,” focused on improving DeFi and liquidity across chains. This initiative aims to lower transaction costs by up to 95% compared to Ethereum layer-1, enhancing scalability and user experience. Ethereum (ETH) : Ethereum has been experiencing positive momentum, closely following the gains in the U.S. stock market indexes. Despite sideways consolidation, ETH is approaching the final phase of a bullish fractal pattern that could lead to a potential 40% price increase. Tron (TRX) : TRX saw a 9.5% monthly increase, outperforming Ethereum and Solana, despite a significant decline in total value locked (TVL) on the Tron network. Polkadot (DOT) : DOT continues to focus on improving interoperability and scalability, maintaining its position as one of the leading blockchain projects. Its progress is often linked to parachain developments and ecosystem growth. >> Conclusion Crypto investors are gearing up for a potential bull run, with altcoins like BigBossInu, Ethereum, XRP, Uniswap, Tron, and Polkadot set for growth. BigBossInu’s presale gains momentum, Ethereum hints at a breakout, and XRP benefits from legal wins.

If you regret missing out on these opportunities, there’s a new contender in the spotlight – Lightchain AI . This innovative project has already raised over $10.4 million in its presale at a price of $0.00525, positioning itself as the next big thing in the meme coin space—but with an added layer of utility and innovation. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin Icons of the Meme Economy Dogecoin (DOGE), the first of funny coins, got notice for its group-based growth. What began as a jest has turned into a real money type, with support from well-known people and more use for paying and giving tips. Shiba Inu (SHIB) did the same, bringing its own style by adding use through group trade places (ShibaSwap) and holding methods. Its fast climb made many small b͏uys into lots of cash. Pepe Coin (PEPE), inspired by the famous meme, caused a stir in 2023 by giving quick rewards to first users, showing the market’s fondness for meme tokens. But these profits have led many buyers looking for the next big chance. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out as a Meme Coin Revolution Lightchain AI combines the viral appeal of meme coins with the transformative power of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike traditional meme coins, it offers real-world utility and scalability, enabling developers to create intelligent decentralized applications (dApps) on its innovative platform. For investors, Lightchain AI’s presale presents a unique opportunity to capitalize on its potential. For example, an investment of $1,000 could acquire 190,476 LCAI tokens at $0.00525 each. With a projected target price of $1.50 by 2025, this investment could grow to an impressive $285,714. By blending community-driven energy with practical applications, Lightchain AI stands out in the crowded cryptocurrency market as a promising option for both developers and forward-thinking investors. The Future of Meme Coins with Lightchain AI Meme coins have demonstrated their ability to captivate the market’s attention, but Lightchain AI takes the concept further by combining utility with innovation. Envision a platform where creators and developers can seamlessly innovate and monetize their ideas. Lightchain AI’s Memecoin Launchpad makes this vision a reality. By leveraging AI-driven tools, it offers a secure and dynamic environment to foster the creative economy, unlocking new opportunities and driving a robust ecosystem. For those who missed out on Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe Coin, Lightchain AI presents a chance to engage with a platform that merges the excitement of meme coins with the power of cutting-edge blockchain technology. With its presale ongoing , investors can secure their spot in what could be the next big thing in the crypto market. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to join the Lightchain AI community and be a part of the meme coin revolution.

Injective (INJ): Injective has recently reached a record 370 million on-chain transactions, with its price surging over 70% in the past week, achieving an all-time high of $52.62. The rise is partly fueled by interest in AI integration with blockchain and anticipation of new token airdrops.

Likewise, the TON ecosystem has seen enhancements through the integration of Nansen’s analytics tools, providing valuable insights and bolstering its blockchain functionality for both developers and investors. At the same time, Web3Bay (3BAY) is revolutionizing the online shopping experience by incorporating Web3 into e-commerce. This platform diverges from conventional models by granting its community governance rights via the 3BAY token. With over $800K already raised in its ongoing presale, the token gives early holders the chance to influence important platform choices while setting them up for a potential 6,430% return on investment when it launches. Chainlink Whale Activity Prompts Positive Outlook for 2025 Recent activity by Chainlink whales has sparked significant momentum in the market, with LINK experiencing a nearly 5% increase on Tuesday and an overall 18% rise over three days. This upsurge correlates with substantial acquisitions, as large investors have accumulated over 1.40 million LINK tokens, showcasing their confidence in its growth potential. Additionally, this surge in Chainlink whale activity has affected on-chain metrics, indicating a decrease in exchange outflows which suggests a lowering of sell pressure and potential for further price increases. Analysts are now predicting that LINK might reach $40 soon, potentially nearing its all-time high of $52 set in February. This optimistic view highlights Chainlink’s critical role in major projects, suggesting a breakout year might be imminent. TON Ecosystem Enhances Capabilities with Nansen Analytics Partnership The TON ecosystem has advanced significantly through its recent partnership with Nansen, a top on-chain analytics provider. Developed by Telegram, the TON blockchain is designed for fast, scalable, and secure transactions, serving as a robust foundation for cutting-edge decentralized applications. This collaboration has introduced Query and Growth Dashboards, providing the TON ecosystem with sophisticated tools to monitor user activity, transaction volumes, and overall trends. Alex Svanevik, CEO of Nansen, has highlighted their dedication to delivering actionable insights that will support developers, investors, and the wider crypto community in driving innovation and discovering new opportunities within the TON ecosystem. Web3Bay Leads with a Community-Driven E-commerce Platform Web3Bay is at the forefront of integrating Web3 into e-commerce, transitioning control from centralized platforms to its user community. Leveraging blockchain technology, it provides a transparent and secure marketplace that allows users significant input in shaping the platform’s future. 3BAY token holders are pivotal in governance, having the ability to vote on important decisions such as the introduction of new features or adjustments to fee structures. This participatory approach ensures that the platform’s policies align with the needs of its most active users, fostering a culture of fairness and collaborative development. Moreover, Web3Bay extends beyond offering governance rights. Its blockchain infrastructure ensures both security and transparency, affording users full ownership of their data and assets. Sellers receive payments directly into their wallets, circumventing delays typical of intermediary involvement, and buyers maintain autonomy over their personal information. Further enhancing its decentralized ethos, Web3Bay plans to renounce ownership of its smart contracts post-presale, ensuring no single party can alter the platform’s operational framework—a genuine application of Web3 principles in e-commerce. Currently, during its fourth stage of presale, the 3BAY token is priced at $0.0039675 and has amassed over $800,000 in funding. Early investors are positioned to achieve substantial gains, with a potential 6,430% ROI at the projected launch price of $0.1959. Owning 3BAY tokens now means not only securing a say in the platform during its developmental phase but also influencing its trajectory before widespread adoption escalates demand. As the e-commerce sector evolves and decentralization emerges as a crucial advantage, the value of 3BAY tokens is set to increase, presenting a prime investment opportunity in the burgeoning market. Wrapping Up The continued surge in Chainlink whale activity is propelling LINK’s price higher, showcasing robust investor confidence and underscoring its crucial role in advancing blockchain technology. Simultaneously, the TON ecosystem is making significant strides with the aid of Nansen’s analytics, which equips users and developers with essential insights for navigating the blockchain space. Yet, the spotlight is on Web3Bay’s innovative decentralized marketplace, which is transforming the landscape of e-commerce by integrating Web3 capabilities. This shift enables user-driven ownership and governance. The platform’s native 3BAY token not only allows early holders to significantly influence its development but also sets the stage for potentially enormous returns, with a projected ROI of 6,430% at launch. With its central role and the momentum behind its growth, getting involved early in Web3Bay presents a compelling opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the expanding reach of decentralized markets .

Analysts are buzzing about BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a crypto sensation that has already raised $5.2 million in its presale. Whispers of a potential Binance debut are amplifying the hype, drawing comparisons to the explosive rises of Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) and Dogwifhat (WIF) after their own Binance listings. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, 90% staking rewards, and community-driven mission, BTFD Coin isn’t just riding the meme coin wave—it’s redefining it. Let’s unpack why BTFD Coin, WIF, and PENGU are dominating the conversation around the top new meme coins to invest in now. BTFD Coin: A Presale Powerhouse with Binance in Its Sights The phrase “Buy The Dip” has long been a mantra for savvy investors, and BTFD Coin brings that mindset to life. With a presale that’s already raised $5.2 million, this meme coin is turning heads. At $0.000142 per token in Stage 13, the presale is over 97% complete, meaning time is running out to secure your spot before the price jumps to $0.0006 upon listing. What’s Fueling the FOMO? BTFD’s presale performance is more than impressive—it’s a signal of things to come. With over 64 billion tokens sold and 8,500 Bulls already onboard, the community’s energy is palpable. Analysts are predicting a 4,000% surge, which could see the token’s price climb from its presale value to a projected $0.006. To put that into perspective, a $2,500 investment today would buy you approximately 17.6 million BTFD tokens. At the listing price of $0.0006, your investment would already be worth $10,563. But if the projected $0.006 materializes post-listing, you’d be sitting on a jaw-dropping $105,634. Play, Earn, and Stake BTFD Coin is more than just a meme. Its P2E game, launched on January 1, 2025, allows users to earn tokens while gaming, blending entertainment with income.

Solana: The High-Performance Blockchain Powering Scalable Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability and performance. It provides a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps), competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. Solana uses unique architectural choices to enable faster transactions and supports development across multiple programming languages. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of the Solana network. It is used for transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. The potential of Solana lies in its ability to handle high transaction volumes without relying on sharding or second-layer solutions. This makes it attractive for developers looking to build high-activity products and services. SOL underpins the ecosystem and allows users to access various projects on the platform. In the current market cycle, Solana and SOL may appear appealing due to their focus on scalability and performance, which are important factors in blockchain technology.

This upward move represents a 4.9% daily gain and more than a 10% increase over the past week. Analysts have been examining this rally closely, noting that it mirrors patterns observed in past market cycles. Specifically, the role of market pullbacks—often seen as discouraging by short-term investors—has emerged as a critical factor behind Bitcoin’s long-term strength. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Upward Cycle Back? Key Insights Into The Latest Recovery Bitcoin Larger Rally Ahead, Here’s Why According to datascope, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, Bitcoin’s most significant rallies have frequently originated in so-called “bear zones.” These are periods when the market dips sharply, and sentiment turns pessimistic. However, the analyst emphasizes that these pullbacks are more than just periods of loss; they are times when patient investors can position themselves for future gains. The current recovery, as the analyst explains, aligns with a historical pattern where Bitcoin tends to emerge stronger after periods of sharp declines. Datascope wrote in a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTkake platform: When we look at Bitcoin’s pullbacks, a fascinating pattern emerges! What happens in those red-marked zones? The market takes a dive into the “bear zone,” and it feels like all hope is lost. But this is exactly where the magic begins!. By examining past performance, datascope found that Bitcoin’s strongest upward moves have historically followed these bearish periods. Rather than panic-selling, holding steady during these moments has proven advantageous for those looking to capitalize on the eventual market rebound. According to the analyst, “these patterns highlight the importance of market psychology and the power of patience.” Datascope concluded by noting: The takeaway is simple: if you can read Bitcoin’s ups and downs, pullbacks don’t have to be scary—they can be opportunities. While red zones might initially seem discouraging, history proves that the rebounds from these levels are often far more impressive. Patience wins! Coinbase Premium Index Signals Bullish U.S. Sentiment Meanwhile, another reason why Bitcoin’s ongoing recovery could lead to a larger rally is the fact that Coinbase Premium Index (CPI), has returned to positive territory for the first time since early January. This metric reflects the difference between Bitcoin’s prices on Coinbase and other exchanges, often seen as a gauge of US investor sentiment. The recent move into positive territory suggests that American buyers are reclaiming market influence, potentially driving Bitcoin’s recent gains. Related Reading: Crypto Fear And Greed Index Barrels Toward Extreme Greed Again As Bitcoin Price Clears $101,000, Is This Good News? Burak Kesmeci, another contributor to CryptoQuant, observed that US investors are showing renewed interest in Bitcoin as the inauguration of the new administration approaches. Kesmeci noted that the positive CPI readings indicate a market dominated by buyers on both daily and hourly timeframes. This shift in sentiment comes as Bitcoin reclaims the $100,000 milestone and may signal a broader trend of optimism among US investors.

Bitcoin (BTC) may rule the market, but altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and the emerging BigBossInu are shining with incredible profit potential. These picks are expected to take off as the market ignites. BigBossInu: Crypto Innovation at Its Finest, with a Hot Presale BigBossInu is making a splash in the cryptocurrency space with a presale that has investors excited. It’s a lucrative opportunity for early backers, with rewards expected to be substantial. Equipped with innovative features and a dynamic roadmap, BigBossInu is positioned for remarkable growth. BigBossInu is on a growth trajectory far exceeding the modest returns projected for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even Cardano. In just minutes during its presale, BigBossInu raised $100,000, signaling massive interest and strong investor confidence. Its initial listing price of $0.007 already saw a 6,970% return for early buyers, with even greater potential ahead. BigBossInu : $100,000 raised in minutes—celebrate by using code EXTRA50X for an exclusive 50% EXTRA BONUS! >> Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade steadily around $3,463, with its ecosystem growing as decentralized finance (DeFi) and Layer-2 solutions gain traction. Analysts expect ETH to push higher as Ethereum ETFs start gaining traction and broader adoption of Ethereum’s DeFi infrastructure continues to expand​. Uniswap (UNI) saw a significant jump of 12% following the announcement of its new Layer-2 project called Unichain . This development aims to enhance DeFi scalability and lower transaction costs by 95%, making it a crucial move in improving liquidity across Ethereum’s ecosystem. Arbitrum (ARB) is facing a notable event with a token unlock scheduled for October 16, which will release approximately 92.65 million ARB tokens. This could impact ARB’s price and market dynamics as it represents 2.56% of its circulating supply, valued at around $49.4 million​. Sei (SEI) has hit a new all-time high of $1.59 recently, with its price currently hovering at $0.87. The Sei network is rapidly growing, particularly in the decentralized exchange (DEX) space, and the community is bullish about SEI potentially hitting $1 by early 2025 if the ecosystem continues its expansion​. >> Conclusion BigBossInu is making waves in the crypto space with a promising presale, offering substantial rewards for early backers. As Ethereum, Uniswap, and Arbitrum continue their growth, BigBossInu’s dynamic roadmap places it as a contender to surpass Cardano. Investors should consider the potential but be mindful of the inherent risks in this volatile market.

Here’s what we found. This article is written for educational purposes, and doesn’t encourage the use of the darkweb. Table of Contents What is the dark web? What is BreachForums? What we found on the dark web crime hub BreachForums Services found on BreachForums What do dark web criminals do with stolen user data? How to stay safe online What is the dark web? As a quick bit of background information, let’s clarify what we mean by the dark web and cybercrime forums. The dark web is a hidden part of the internet, accessible only through special browsing software like Tor, that focuses on user anonymity. The dark web serves as a hub for both legitimate uses, such as privacy-conscious browsing, and illegal activities, including the sale of stolen data, drugs, weapons, services, and other contraband. Cybercrime forums on the dark web are communities where hackers, fraudsters, and other criminals exchange information, tools, and services, often involving cryptocurrencies to facilitate anonymous transactions. You might also like: Hackers leak El Salvador’s Chivo Bitcoin wallet code What is BreachForums? BreachForums was launched as RaidForums in 2015 by Portuguese hacker Diogo Santos Coelho. RaidForums was started as a community focused on ‘raiding’ websites and online spaces as a form of pranking, trolling, or online disruption. However, as hackers on the site began breaching social media platforms and websites and stealing millions of user credentials, they started to sell these credentials to the highest bidder. RaidForums quickly evolved into one of the most sophisticated and well-established hubs of organized criminal activity on the dark web. Binance users KYC data seems to be on sale on the dark web now alleged github hack leak pic.twitter.com/SPjGQPsIlS — otteroooo (@otteroooo) February 4, 2024 When Binance was breached in February 2024 , BreachedForums was the first place that the user KYC details popped up for sale, and the same was true of the leaked Bitcoin ATM code used in the state of El Salvador, which appeared for sale on BreachForums in April of the same year. The site started to attract cybercriminals looking to buy sensitive information from corporate security breaches and even leaked government documents, causing it to be the focus of international law enforcement efforts. In 2022, Europol and U.S. intelligence agencies collaborated to seize the website and identify and arrest founder Diogo Santos Coelho who is now in UK custody awaiting extradition to the US for charges of cybercrime. FBI banner placed on BreachForums following 2022 seizure RaidForums was quickly re-established as BreachForums by a user called PomPomPurin who was arrested by the FBI in 2023, and the site was taken over by another user called Baphomet. BreachForums was seized by the FBI in May 2024, although cloned versions of the site have since popped up once more. While the site still boasts strong activity, as we’re about to show, many online users have speculated that the website may be a ‘honeypot’ or trap set up by the FBI to monitor cybercriminals and expose them for prosecution. What we found on the dark web crime hub BreachForums Entering BreachForums, we were immediately confronted with a barrage of proposed illegal activity. While some cybercrime forums adopt a more subtle approach of masquerading as communities of IT and cybersecurity enthusiasts, BreachForums has never made any such efforts to hide its true nature, and the home page at the time of our login showed users offering the violent services of the MS13 or La Mara Salvatruca gang for $10,000. Like all dark web postings involving violence, this is more likely to be a scam than a genuine offer, but the illegal activity didn’t stop there. The scrolling chatbox of the website also displayed users discussing, in real-time, the sale of The forum’s marketplace, which is buzzing with sellers offering illegal products such as stolen data , tutorials on bank fraud and credit card fraud, IP tracking, and much more. There was also, of course, a thread of Anime and Manga appreciation because even cybercriminals have hobbies. Anime thread | source: BreachForums All of the posts shown in this article were posted within hours of our initial login, demonstrating strong activity in an online community that is still very active, although one presumes under heavy observation from law enforcement. The above image shows users selling access to everything from online video streaming platforms like Paramount Plus and Netflix to breached OnlyFans accounts. Posts in the leaked data subforum showed users selling data leaks, including bundles of email logins for C-Suite directors of various companies as well as ID documents from the UAE, India, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, as well as a leak of files and images stolen from Saudi Arabian military emails. This last leak featuring military documents appears genuine according to our preliminary investigation but was also shown to be from 2016, indicating that this user is attempting to pass off old leaked information as fresh, one of many examples of the types of scams that take place even among cybercriminals online. One user claimed to have exclusive access to an Australian health insurance MedBank leak, and Australia’s MedBank was indeed breached by Russian cybercriminals in 2022 when the personal information of 9.7m Australians was stolen. Database leaks subforum | source: BreachForums Unlike the hitman-for-hire type posts that the dark web is famous for, these document and identity leaks are sadly very plausible, as the main purpose of BreachForums is indeed to sell stolen data of this nature, and business has been booming for years. However, with the repeated seizures and arrests by law enforcement, it’s possible that some of these posts are also traps by the FBI or other agencies seeking to catch criminals in the act. Services found on BreachForums As well as stolen data, industrious cybercriminals also offer various services for hire on the dark web, invariably taking cryptocurrency as payment . On BreachForums, we immediately found users purporting to offer DDoS services, access to a distributed denial of service attack where criminals leverage a botnet to shut down a website’s operations to either extort money from the victim, target competing businesses or simply spite an enemy. Services subforum | source: BreachForums One online group of cybercriminal developers had an advertisement for HNVC or Hidden Virtual Network Computing services that can be used to gain remote access to a victim’s computer. It was interesting to note that much like an ad for legal online services, the post had a detailed list of features and pricing options available and offered customer support in both Russian and English. Services subforum | source: BreachForums Other services included services to provide phone numbers allowing criminals to receive login codes to activate online accounts without identifying themselves or their own phone number. We found bulk email senders used for illegal mass-marketing campaigns for products, phishing scams, or other malware, and also saw advertisements for email flooders used to clog up the email inbox of an enemy in an effort to make the email unusable or to hide malicious activities such as warnings of attempted logins. One email flooder went to the trouble of creating what appears to be an AI-generated banner ad and logo for their service, the name of which we have censored so as not to advertise their services. AI-generated ad for dark web email flooder | Source: BreachForums We saw entire threads dedicated to services selling access to remote online servers, programming services for web development, and even graphic design services, all of which could be used to create sophisticated scams such as fraudulent landing pages to steal victim’s user data. Of course, while some of these services may be legitimate, many of them are likely fake, and due to the website being seized and reopened multiple times, the accounts here are all under two years old. Cybercrime forums often operate on an escrow basis, or on the basis of trust where a user has a proven track record of ‘honest’ sales, whereas this new website has few measures in place to safeguard against scams. We did see several services advertising that they accept escrow payments, meaning a vetted third party holds funds until both parties are satisfied with payment, as with this developer offering pre-made phishing websites and landing pages. Services subforum | source: BreachForums The willingness to accept escrow indicates that this user may indeed be selling what they claim to sell, although there are likely many scams involving escrow payments on this site as well. In fact, the site has an entire scam thread on the site that shows a log of users reporting on-site scams. User uuu732 reports that their efforts to scam others online backfired due to falling prey to a scam on BreachForums themselves. They paid user PennyTrate-x $300 for software that would allow them to bypass malware detection softwares and send malware-infected PDFs to their unsuspecting victims. Scam Reports subforum | source:crypto.news The seller did not provide the goods, and when the moderator asked them for an explanation, they declined to respond, leading to their account getting banned. Another user reported a dispute with a different seller. In this case, the user spent $500 attempting to purchase database of user credentials breached from a Swiss insurance company and an additional $1,300 trying to purchase the database of a Swiss retail outlet. They reported that they did not receive their illicit data in either transaction. What do dark web criminals do with stolen user data? Cybercriminals buy login data and user data in an effort to hack email and social media accounts to either gain access to a user’s finances and rob them, or to gain access to sensitive information that they can further exploit. For example, a dark net criminal might access a user’s PayPal account and try to make unauthorized purchases or transfer funds directly to another account, or commit identity theft by applying for loans in someone else’s name using their passport information. This information is also commonly used for extortion and blackmail purposes when criminals find sensitive information by logging into their victim’s accounts. How to stay safe online As we can see, the dark web is a dangerous subsection of the internet for many reasons. Even on this website that has been seized and reopened multiple times, we find an open-air bazaar of criminal activity ranging from illegal services and products to scams being perpetrated against other members of the forum. On the clearnet, users can stay safe by implementing two-factor authentication on their devices and online accounts, meaning a second device like their phone is needed to sign in to an account. This can help prevent hacking and phishing attacks. Likewise, taking care to verify URLs online to ensure that they’re correct and not mispelled or fraudulent can help prevent falling prey to an attack. Unsuspecting users visiting the dark web, even purely out of personal interest, will find themselves rubbing shoulders with seasoned scammers and hackers probing for any weakness they can find. Users visiting the dark web should avoid clicking on any unfamiliar links or downloading any files, and while it should go without saying, making a purchase of any kind can open you up to all kinds of trouble from both legal and non-legal actors. In fact, the best way to stay safe from the dark web is simply not to visit it in the first place! Let us do that for you. We aim to visit other corners of the dark web on a regular basis and give regular updates on our findings, keeping you up to date on the underbelly of the global internet. You might also like: FBI traces crypto transfers to dismantle $100m dark web marketplace How to get to the dark web on a Chromebook? People ask this all the time, and the answer is a little complicated. Firstly, we don’t recommend that anyone accesses the dark web! While the space is interesting to explore from a journalistic point of view, it’s also full of scammers and other types of criminals that can be dangerous to come across. To get to the dark web on a Chromebook, people typically install Linux via the Crostini app and simply add the Tor browser repository to gain access to Tor’s hidden serices, AKA the dark web. However, once again, this is not recommended unless done for research or journalism purposes. Why is the dark web so creepy? The dark web has a reputation for being ‘creepy’ partly due to the prevalence of popular YouTube videos which showed YouTubers claiming to open ‘mystery boxes’ from the dark web, as well as the popularity of short stories and ‘creepypastas’ which featured the dark web in horror fiction. In reality, these videos are typically staged, and the dark web is often more businesslike. People usually access it either to share information without being censored or persecuted, such as political whistleblowers, or, of course, to perpetrate cybercrime and deal in contraband. How to check my if my email is on dark web? While breached email addresses are sold on websites like Nulled, you don’t need to access the dark web to see if your email is there. To check if your email is on the dark web, you can use the Have I Been PWNed tool on the clear net instead. Is the dark web real ? Yes, the dark web is very real! Large sums of money are exchanged in the sale of narcotics, breached online accounts, malware, weapons, hacking services for hire, and other forms of contraband. What to do if email is on dark web ? If your email is found to be on the dark web, you should change your password immediately and setting up two-factor authentication (2FA). If you’re finding that people are still trying to access your account, such as with emails in your inbox asking you to confirm logins, you might want to consider changing your email address altogether.",Feature|Exclusive|Crime|darknet,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|BNB,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-18 03:46:00

While projects like Ethereum and Solana could reap the benefits of this bull run, analysts are highlighting Rollblock as a highly lucrative alternative. Rollblock Attracts Investors with Major Presale Win Rollblock is a GambleFi project aiming to revolutionize the $450 billion traditional gambling market through blockchain technology. The Web3 casino features over 7,000 games, live dealers, and sports betting, all operating on-chain. This ensures every outcome is registered and encrypted on Ethereum, eliminating the risk of fraud. The focus on transparency and safety has paid off for Rollblock. In December alone, the protocol recorded $1.75 million in wagers alongside a 600% surge in signups and deposits. Analysts predict these figures could double by the end of January. Rollblock’s success doesn’t stop there. The protocol raised over $8.7 million from more than 40,000 participants during its presale. RBLK, Rollblock’s native token, has already delivered a 330% return for early investors. Currently priced at $0.046, experts believe RBLK could hit $1 by the end of 2025, outperforming Ethereum and Solana by a wide margin. This hype is further fueled by Rollblock’s revenue-sharing model. The GambleFi protocol allocates up to 30% of its revenue to support RBLK’s price growth. Of these tokens, 40% are used to provide some of the highest APYs on the market for RBLK stakers, while the remaining 60% are immediately burned. The entire ecosystem operates under an e-gaming license issued by the Anjouan Authority. Additionally, Rollblock’s smart contracts have successfully passed a SolidProof audit showcasing its dedication to transparency. Traders Eye a Break Above $5k for Ethereum Ethereum is trading at $3,350 as it consolidates following a recent pullback. Growing investor interest and technical indicators suggest the potential for upward momentum. A breakout above the $3,480 resistance could trigger a rally toward $3,800–$3,900, with $4,000 as a critical psychological target for Ethereum. The Relative Strength Index is currently at 27, indicating oversold conditions that often precede price rebounds. Whale activity has also increased, supporting the case for a bullish move. Institutional interest remains a strong driver for Ethereum. December 2024 saw over $2 billion in ETF inflows, with BlackRock’s ETHA fund alone contributing $1.4 billion, highlighting Ethereum’s growing appeal among long-term investors. Can Solana Reach $500 This Cycle? Solana is trading at $217, up 3.01% in the past 24 hours as optimism builds around its long-term potential. With its momentum snowballing, experts believe that Solana could reach $500 by 2025. Key factors supporting this outlook include the anticipated approval of Solana-based ETFs, which could bring billions in investments and position it as a major player in blockchain adoption. FDUSD’s recent launch has also strengthened Solana’s financial infrastructure. On-chain data reveals growing whale activity, with large transaction volumes signaling confidence in Solana’s long-term potential. RSI and trading volumes suggest room for further upside, while breakout patterns on TradingView align with the bullish sentiment. Is $1 a Real Target for Rollblock?

Trump Buys Solana (TRUMPSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 8Ruz6rzYPpKHActX3jo49v8WBhiJ5KsGM6dyCghQj3i – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-18 03:55:00
