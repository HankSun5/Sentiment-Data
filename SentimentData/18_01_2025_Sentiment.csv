Whales Purchase Over $1 Billion in ETH appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The overall cryptocurrency market has shown strong bullish potential ahead of President-elect and pro-crypto advocate Donald Trump’s inauguration, scheduled for January 20, 2025. However, one thing that has been capturing the massive attention of crypto enthusiasts is the recent activity of crypto giants over the past week. Whales Purchase Over $1 Billion in ETH Recently, a prominent crypto expert posted on X (formerly Twitter), revealing that whales have purchased over a billion dollars worth of Ethereum (ETH) in the past week. The expert stated that more than 330,000 ETH, valued at over $1 billion, has been acquired by these crypto whales. Whales have accumulated over 330,000 #Ethereum $ETH in the past week, valued at more than $1 billion! pic.twitter.com/aNuP9HFwEh — Ali (@ali_charts) January 17, 2025 This large accumulation of ETH by whales suggests a strategic move to capitalize on Trump’s inauguration, which is expected to have a positive impact on the crypto market. However, experts and analysts are already speculating that the crypto market could experience a significant surge following the inauguration day. In the meantime, there is also a possibility of profit booking as the market has been rising over the past few days. However, only time will tell where the market will head after this upcoming political event. Current Price Momentum and Rising Participation Currently, ETH has crossed the $3,500 mark and is trading near $3,515. It has experienced a price surge of over 5.5% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, it has attracted significant traders and investors, resulting in an 11% jump in trading volume. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action and Key Levels With the impressive price surge, ETH has once again reached the crucial resistance level of $3,500, where it previously experienced a price reversal. According to expert technical analysis, if ETH breaches this resistance level and closes a daily candle above $3,550, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 15% to reach the $4,100 mark in the coming days.

Wyoming took its first bold step toward a strategic bitcoin reserve! Thank you Rep. Wasserburger for introducing legislation to allow permanent funds to diversify into Bitcoin. This forward-thinking approach will benefit our state as we lead the nation in financial innovation! — Senator Cynthia Lummis (@SenLummis) January 17, 2025 Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, one of the first to highlight the proposal, emphasized its potential benefits to the state’s financial strategy. “This forward-thinking approach will benefit our state as we lead the nation in financial innovation,” Lummis remarked . Wyoming’s Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Proposal: Will It Inspire Others? As states explore the potential of integrating Bitcoin into public financial strategies, Wyoming’s latest proposal sets a precedent that could influence others, including Massachusetts. According to Wasserburger, the bill’s sponsor, the proposal aligns with Wyoming’s history of pioneering firsts. “Wyoming has always been a pioneer—from women’s suffrage to the first national park; from the invention of the LLC to the frontier of digital assets.,” Wasserburger said. Source: wyoleg.gov HB0201 authorizes the state treasurer to invest portions of Wyoming’s general fund, permanent Wyoming mineral trust fund, and permanent land fund in Bitcoin, with investments capped at 3% of these funds to balance potential gains with prudent risk management. To address security concerns, the bill requires robust custody solutions for Bitcoin holdings, emphasizing the protection of private keys and adherence to strict security standards. The proposal leverages Wyoming’s comprehensive legislative framework, including the Wyoming Special Purpose Depository Institution (SPDI) model, which has gained widespread recognition in the digital asset space. Since 2018, Wyoming has established itself as a pioneer in Bitcoin-friendly legislation, passing more than two dozen laws supporting digital assets. These initiatives include recognizing Bitcoin as property and providing regulatory clarity for blockchain companies, solidifying the state’s reputation as a hub for digital innovation. Alongside Wyoming, Massachusetts has also proposed a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Source: Bitcoin Magazine / X State Senator Peter Durant, who filed the bill, expressed enthusiasm about advancing legislation that could shape the state’s financial future. Excited to get to work on this legislation! https://t.co/zT6W3JeGZh — State Senator Peter Durant (@senpeterdurant) January 17, 2025 The Economic Case for a Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Bitcoin , often referred to as “digital gold,” has demonstrated substantial appreciation and resilience over the past decade. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply align with principles of fiscal independence and economic stability. As a result, many institutions, companies, and countries have begun incorporating Bitcoin into their investment portfolios. Wasserburger emphasized the urgency of adopting such measures, stating, “We can’t afford to sit on the sidelines while other states move forward with their own Bitcoin reserve bills.” Establishing a Bitcoin reserve could help Wyoming mitigate risks associated with inflation and economic volatility while ensuring long-term financial security for its citizens. The proposal also aligns with Senator Cynthia Lummis’ advocacy for a United States Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Lummis’ 2024 draft of the Bitcoin Act, which proposed creating a federal Bitcoin reserve to reinforce America’s financial standing, has laid the groundwork for current legislative efforts. Elsewhere, momentum for Bitcoin reserves continues to grow. On January 16, Texas Senator Charles Schwertner filed Senate Bill 778 (SB 778) to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve. Internationally, the Czech Republic’s central bank is also exploring Bitcoin as a reserve asset , as governments and institutions continue to evaluate the digital asset’s potential.

The crypto exchange’s update follows a joint statement from the U.S., Japan, and South Korea that was published this week. The statement attributed the attacks to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK, or North Korea), including the infamous Lazarus Group. According to the firm, the freezing was the first significant step in a long and intricate recovery procedure that involved numerous jurisdictions and court cases. WazirX initiates recovery efforts after losing $230 million WazirX’s July 2024 resulted in the loss of nearly 45% of the platform’s total cryptocurrency assets, or more than $230 million. The firm’s hack ranks third among the largest crypto hacks and exploits recorded in 2024, following PlayDapp’s $290 million and DMM Bitcoin’s $308 million in losses. The attack that wiped out most of the platform’s assets left WazirX with more than $546.5 million in liabilities. Multiple layers of security, including six signatories and whitelisted destination addresses, protected the compromised wallet, which relied on Liminal’s digital asset custody infrastructure. However, the hackers took advantage of a significant flaw, a difference between the data shown on Liminal’s interface and the real transaction details. The scammers could reverse-engineer the system and take control of the wallet. After the incident, WazirX parted ways with Liminal Custody. In August 2024, the company has since followed up with a restructuring filing with a Singapore court. WazirX, an exchange founded and currently owned by Zettai in Singapore, has been working with lawyers, forensic experts, and the police to try to recover the stolen funds. WazirX vows to resume trading by February 2025 In November 2024, cofounder Nischal Shetty assured users at a town hall meeting that recovery was underway and said trading could reopen in February 2025. Freezing some of the swiped stablecoins presents a breakthrough event to regain confidence and pay off affected users. Earlier U.N. reports estimated that North Korea stole $3 billion in crypto between 2017 and 2023 to fund its sanctioned nuclear weapons programs. Recent data from Chainalysis showed North Korean hackers were responsible for 61% of all cryptocurrency stolen in 2024, totaling $1.34 billion.

When a company files in such a manner, it means that it has submitted its initial registration statement with the SEC but is yet to make it public. This initial filing will help it gather feedback from the agency and make necessary adjustments before officially announcing its IPO plans. eToro to Go Public in New York According to a report by the Financial Times, which cited people with knowledge of the matter, the Israeli-based crypto and stock trading platform could go public in New York as early as Q2 2025—if successful. It targets a valuation of $5 billion, up from a $3.5 billion market cap in 2023. The report revealed that eToro has partnered with Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and UBS to carry out its plans. This means that these investment banks will guide eToro through the IPO process. Not the First This is not the first time eToro has attempted to go public in the US. In 2021, it entered a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) deal with FinTech Acquisition Corp. V. at a valuation of $10.4 billion. However, the plan fell through due to the bear market of 2022. The SEC did not approve that plan. Multiple crypto-related companies have also attempted to go public through a SPAC deal but have been unsuccessful. In July 2021, USDC issuer Circle filed for an IPO with the SEC through a SPAC deal but later abandoned the plan because it did not meet the SEC’s qualifications at the time. This deal could have given Circle a $9 billion valuation. Crypto miner Prime Blockchain also canceled plans to go public through a SPAC deal in 2022. If successful, eToro will join crypto companies like Coinbase and Bakkt to go public in the US. Several Bitcoin miners, including Marathon Digital, are also listed in the US.

Based on CryptoQuant’s analysis, the surge suggests an increase in institutional investors utilizing OTC channels to accumulate Bitcoin (BTC). Institutional BTC Preference Triggers OTC Trading From the data provided by analysts at CryptoQuant, the spike in inflows resembles a similar trend seen on December 17. Noteworthy, that was the day that Bitcoin hit its all-time high (ATH) of over $108,000. According to CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, such a significant surge in inflows on the Coinbase platform usually indicates that multiple OTC trades are occurring. It also reflects institutions’ preferences to accumulate bitcoin through OTC trading. Julio Moreno, the head of research at CryptoQuant, highlighted that the inflows represent the BTC sourced from Coinbase for institutional clients. Furthermore, he noted that OTC flows recently reached $14 billion, equivalent to 142,000 Bitcoin on the American centralized exchange. Growing Institutional Adoption of BTC With Pro-crypto Government Generally, the digital asset landscape has registered some improvements in the months that followed the United States 2024 presidential elections. Republican politician Donald Trump, known for his pro-crypto stance, won the race , uplifting the ecosystem’s spirit. He is finally coming into power by January 20. One of the moves he intends to make today is ousting Gary Gensler, the current United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman. Former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins has been nominated to replace him. This move is expected to bring more favorable policies to the crypto industry. Bitcoin price will likely register more rally, to the point of oven hitting a new ATH. BTC Price Performance and Potential At this time, Bitcoin traded at $104,951.39, corresponding with a 5.58% increase within 24 hours. While this is a lofty price level, it is still significantly lower than the coin’s ATH of over $108,000. With several nations, including the US, vying to add the flagship cryptocurrency to their strategic reserve, BTC will likely register more gains. The potential growth in Bitcoin ETF inflows could also contribute to the price rally.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Exploring Cardano, Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, and Remittix as standout cryptos for 2025. Table of Contents Cardano eyes RLUSD Solana ready for the next ETF surge XRP rides the bullish wave Dogecoin: Meme to payment option Remittix: The PayFi contender Remittix takes center stage Building a well-rounded crypto lineup for the future is on every investor’s mind. On that note, Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and the rising star Remittix have gained attention so far in 2025. Cardano eyes RLUSD Cardano recently made headlines when its founder Charles Hoskinson revealed talks to integrate Ripple’s new stablecoin, RLUSD. The Cardano team sees RLUSD as a perfect fit to strengthen its stablecoin offerings, which already include tokens like USDM and Djed. If this integration works out, Cardano could boost its decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, drawing more liquidity and user adoption. Investors still recall that Cardano’s ADA token hit a two-year high before volatile market conditions triggered a decline. Long-term holders believe that stablecoin collaborations could help ADA stabilize and even push it upward in 2025. Solana ready for the next ETF surge Solana currently trades at around $219, showing a 17% increase over the past seven days. Banking giants hint that a spot-based SOL exchange-traded fund could bring in billions in new investments. If approvals materialize in the coming months, Solana might see another massive climb, especially if Donald Trump’s administration leans more crypto-friendly. The Solana network’s main attraction is its high-speed transactions, perfect for NFTs and DeFi. However, critics note the occasional outages that undermine user trust. If Solana solves its downtime issues and secures an ETF listing, many experts think it might become the major DeFi powerhouse in 2025. You might also like: Remittix tipped for greater long-term growth than Shiba Inu and Dogecoin XRP rides the bullish wave The XRP price has surged over 40% in the last week and past 30 days. A court ruling clarified that XRP isn’t a security in secondary markets, fueling confidence. There’s also growing speculation that a spot-based XRP ETF could appear soon, with executives like Ripple President Monica Long feeling upbeat. While regulatory uncertainties hang overhead, optimism remains. Ripple aims to expand XRP’s use in remittances and corporate payments, and a bullish run could continue if ETFs or big partners jump on board. Dogecoin: Meme to payment option Priced around $0.41 dollars, Dogecoin is up 24.71% in the last week. Major whale moves have rattled watchers, but some interpret these big transactions as signs of renewed interest. Tesla’s decision to accept DOGE for select payments hints at mainstream acceptance. While Dogecoin has soared in the past on celebrity endorsements and community zeal, it needs lasting adoption to stay relevant. If its developers deliver more on the utility front, DOGE could maintain its standing as an iconic crypto. Nonetheless, some see it as a gateway token for newbies, which might keep the coin rising through 2025. You might also like: Solana, Sui investors flock to new viral altcoin Remittix Remittix: The PayFi contender Despite not being a legacy token, Remittix is attracting big buzz for its PayFi approach — mixing crypto innovation with traditional banking. In just three weeks, Remittix raised over $3 million in its presale, pushing the token price up from $0.0199 to $0.0207. Analysts suggest that Remittix could hit a 1-dollar milestone if enough users adopt it for cross-border payments. Unlike meme or purely DeFi tokens, Remittix focuses on everyday transactions. By enabling fast crypto-to-fiat settlements with zero hidden fees, Remittix appeals to businesses and individuals alike. Its Pay API will help merchants accept crypto payments, converting them to fiat in under 24 hours. Remittix takes center stage Cardano might soon integrate RLUSD, Solana could see an ETF windfall, XRP edges closer to regulatory clarification, and Dogecoin remains an entertaining fan favorite. However, Remittix is the big story — its PayFi model sets it apart as an easy-to-use altcoin for cross-border transactions. To learn more about Remittix, visit their website or social media channels.

Elon Bromance (ELOBRO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOBRO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Bromance by entering its contract address – FY7aYv7K3yEE9Z8hzgURj5z7biTE8Z6BpunBPAnCEpxj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOBRO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 22:33:00

However, since the company has a European regional headquarters in Paris, it is more probable that the approval was given by the French financial authorities. According to Eric Anziani, Crypto.com’s president and COO, MiCA is crucial because it helps build trust in the crypto sector. “We have always been fully supportive of MiCA and strongly believe it will bring clarity, transparency, and establish a more streamlined sentiment towards the regulation of our industry across the EU.” Eric Anziani In 2021, Crypto.com was also issued a Class 3 Virtual Financial Assets (VFA) License by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA), which enabled it to place orders, offer custody services, and operate on its own account. The MFSA also granted the company in-principle approval of the Financial Institution License. Impact of MiCA on the crypto industry MiCA sets out comprehensive regulations for crypto assets, service providers, and jurisdictional governance. It is meant to harmonize operations while ensuring compliance with EU-wide standards. The framework also outlines a set of tough rules for stablecoins. Earlier this week, Dutch regulators granted MiCA licenses to four crypto companies, including MoonPay. Circle, the creator of USDC stablecoin and a cryptocurrency firm, also secured the EU’s inaugural MiCA greenlight last year. As a result, in July 2024, Circle became an e-money institution (EMI) in France, which allowed the company to function under the stringent EU regulation of cryptocurrencies. Boerse Stuttgart Digital has been among the earliest ones to secure a MiCA license in Germany. The license was issued by the German regulator BaFin and enables Boerse Stuttgart Digital to provide all of its services across the EU member states. MiCA could also set a precedent for regulating crypto outside of Europe. According to Cryptopolitan, it provides a unified framework that other nations may follow. Cryptopolitan further stated , “MiCA’s structured approach may influence global regulators, especially in the US, where enforcement often outweighs clear rulemaking.” The in-principle MiCA approval is part of Crypto.com’s larger plan to grow its footprint in the world. Launched in 2016, the exchange now has more than 100 million users. The firm has obtained licenses in key jurisdictions such as Singapore, Australia, and the United Kingdom.

The lawsuit names former CEO Gregory Becker, ex-CFO Daniel Beck, and 15 others. The FDIC, acting as SVB’s receiver, says the defendants ignored basic banking principles and internal risk policies. Instead, they allegedly chased profits and a higher stock price, exposing the bank to “catastrophic risks,” according to the court documents. Risky bets and a $294 million dividend At the heart of the FDIC’s allegations is a series of poor decisions tied to interest rates and liquidity management. Silicon Valley Bank was heavily reliant on long-term government bonds, including U.S. Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, which were sensitive to rising interest rates. When the Federal Reserve began hiking rates in response to inflation, these assets plummeted in value, slashing SVB’s ability to cover liabilities. The FDIC also criticized a “grossly imprudent” $294 million dividend payment made to SVB’s parent company in December 2022. By draining the bank’s capital just three months before its collapse, the payment left SVB vulnerable at a time when it desperately needed cash to stay afloat. Defendants fight back Lawyers for Laura Izurieta, SVB’s former Chief Risk Officer, pushed back hard against the allegations. Izurieta left the bank in April 2022, nearly a year before the meltdown. Her legal team called her inclusion in the suit “outrageous,” claiming she provided sound advice on risk management before her departure. Other defendants, including Becker, have not publicly commented, though Reuters reports that Becker’s legal team said he was traveling and unavailable. Silicon Valley Bank’s downfall began on March 8, 2023, when the bank announced it had sold $21 billion worth of securities at a staggering $1.8 billion loss. It also shared plans to raise $2.25 billion through a stock sale to cover the hole in its balance sheet. That announcement set off a chain reaction of panic. By March 9, venture capital firms and tech startups were withdrawing deposits at an alarming rate. Founders Fund, led by Peter Thiel, reportedly pulled all its deposits, and by the end of the day, SVB faced $42 billion in withdrawal requests—equal to a quarter of its total deposits. The bank ended the day with a negative cash balance of nearly $1 billion, making regulatory intervention inevitable. On March 10, regulators seized SVB. The collapse stunned Silicon Valley, as SVB had long been the go-to bank. Its demise also rattled financial markets including crypto, as an unusually high percentage of the bank’s deposits—over 90%—were uninsured. Aftermath and acquisition by First Citizens The FDIC claims it tried to act quickly and stabilize the situation, telling depositors that all funds, including those above the $250,000 insurance limit, would be accessible by March 13, 2023. But the damage was already done. And SVB’s collapse triggered a domino effect, with Signature Bank and First Republic Bank also going under in the weeks that followed. On March 26, North Carolina-based First Citizens BancShares stepped in to acquire most of SVB’s assets and deposits in a deal brokered by the FDIC. First Citizens took over tens of billions in loans but left $90 billion worth of securities under FDIC receivership. At the time of its collapse, SVB had $209 billion in assets, making it the 16th largest bank in the United States. Its failure now sits alongside infamous banking disasters like Washington Mutual’s 2008 collapse.

The allure of RCO Finance stems not only from its innovative features but also from the promise of massive returns, post-presale, drawing in investors who are looking for the next big opportunity in the crypto space. Cardano and Solana Struggle to Regain Momentum Cardano (ADA) has demonstrated resilience, with its price currently around $1.05, up 4% over the past week. This price gain comes amidst Cardano’s efforts to enhance its scalability through Hydra, its layer-2 scaling solution, which recently allowed it to process over 2 billion transactions in just four hours, surpassing Solana in transaction speed. This technological leap has sparked renewed investor interest, positioning Cardano as a strong contender in the DeFi space despite upcoming token unlocks that are expected to have minimal market impact. On the other hand, Solana has been on an upward trajectory, trading at approximately $189.22, despite a 4.2% decline over the past week. Over the year, it has seen a modest 99% price increase. This rise in SOL’s price can be attributed to growing speculation around a potential Solana ETF approval and substantial network activity, including the listing of new memecoins like ACT and PNUT on Binance. Additionally, Solana’s open interest has crossed $5 billion, reflecting a significant increase in capital inflows, which suggests robust market participation and confidence in its continued bullish momentum. However, Solana still faces challenges like network congestion, which it is actively working to resolve through technological updates like its v1.16 release, introducing features such as ‘confidential transfers’ for enhanced privacy. These developments have led investors from both Cardano and Solana ecosystems to explore new opportunities, with RCO Finance (RCOF) emerging as a cryptocurrency with potentially higher returns through its innovative use of AI and broad asset access. Investors Eye RCO Finance (RCOF) for Lucrative Returns The presale of RCO Finance’s native token, RCOF, has captured the attention of those looking to diversify from Cardano and Solana. Currently, in its fourth presale stage , the RCOF token’s price has surged by 509% to $0.07770 from its initial offering, signaling strong market interest. As the presale progresses to its final round, the price is expected to jump another 175% to $0.21420, offering early investors significant gains even before the token hits public exchanges. Upon listing, RCOF is projected to debut between $0.4 and $0.6, but the real excitement revolves around what happens post-launch. With the official rollout of the RCO Finance platform, the value of RCOF could soar by as much as 43,000%, offering early investors a chance to see their investments multiply immensely. This expectation is not just based on hype but on the robust features and utility that RCO Finance is set to introduce to the DeFi landscape. RCO Finance: Revolutionizing DeFi with AI and Accessibility RCO Finance stands out with its AI-powered Robo Advisor , which dynamically crafts investment strategies tailored to individual financial goals, risk profiles, and market conditions. This AI tool will analyze vast amounts of data in real time, adjusting portfolios to maximize returns, a feature that democratizes access to sophisticated financial strategies without the need for intermediaries. Moreover, RCO Finance will offer trading across over 120,000 assets, including tokenized real-world assets like real estate, which were previously out of reach for many retail investors. This wide asset selection supports diversification, which is key in managing investment risks. The platform shall also operate within a KYC-free ecosystem, focusing on user privacy and ease of access, allowing users to engage with DeFi without cumbersome identity verifications. Security is not compromised, as evidenced by the smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof, which ensures the integrity and safety of investments on the platform. The tokenomics of RCOF further enhances its appeal, with a significant portion of tokens allocated for public sale, ensuring community involvement in governance and decision-making. This model, combined with a deflationary mechanism where unsold tokens are burned, supportsthe long-term value appreciation of RCOF. Given these features, RCO Finance is poised to revolutionize how investments are made in the DeFi sector, potentially leading to a tremendous growth trajectory for its native token, RCOF. With its AI-driven platform, broad asset access, and commitment to privacy and security, RCO Finance could indeed witness an exponential surge in its token’s value, making it a focal point for Cardano and Solana traders looking for the next big move in cryptocurrency investment.

This impressive rebound has sparked renewed optimism among investors, who are now eyeing the potential for a bullish continuation in the weeks ahead. The rapid price increase has positioned Solana as one of the top-performing assets in the crypto market, signaling a potential shift in momentum. Related Reading: Ondo Finance Funding Rate Signals Greed Among Investors – Sign Of Strength? Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared a detailed technical analysis, highlighting that Solana has broken out of its prolonged downtrend. According to Jelle, SOL has successfully reclaimed crucial monthly and weekly support levels, indicating a significant move could be on the horizon. These levels, often considered key benchmarks for long-term stability, suggest that Solana’s recent gains may be more than just a temporary bounce. If Solana can sustain this momentum, it may not only recover from recent losses but also pave the way for further gains, potentially outperforming other major altcoins. As technical indicators align with market enthusiasm, Solana could be gearing up for a breakout rally that captures the spotlight. Solana Set To Enter Price Discovery Phase Solana (SOL) emerged as one of the top market performers in 2024, posting an impressive surge of over 170%. This stellar performance cemented its position as a market leader and highlighted its resilience and growth potential within the crypto space. As 2025 unfolds, optimism surrounding Solana remains high, with many investors anticipating significant gains in the coming months. The momentum appears to be building already, as Solana begins the year with a potential breakout. Renowned analyst Jelle recently shared insights on X, pointing out that SOL has successfully broken out of the downtrend that had restrained it since late November. Moreover, Solana has reclaimed both monthly and weekly support levels—crucial milestones indicating that the asset has regained its bullish footing. According to Jelle, the price action for Solana is “super clean,” suggesting that the cryptocurrency is well-positioned for higher valuations. Jelle’s initial target for SOL is set at $330, a level that would not only mark a significant recovery but could also push Solana into a price discovery phase. This phase typically sees heightened market interest and volatility as traders and investors recalibrate expectations for the asset’s long-term value. With technical indicators and market sentiment aligning, Solana appears poised to capitalize on its upward trajectory.

As anticipation builds for further upside, traders and investors are closely monitoring key levels, knowing that the cryptocurrency’s next big move could redefine its role in the broader crypto ecosystem. SOL Testing Crucial Supply Around $220 Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $218, approaching a critical level that could determine its next major move. The price is on the verge of setting a new local high above $222, a significant resistance point. Breaking through this level would signal a strong bullish continuation, setting the stage for massive price appreciation and the potential to reclaim its all-time high (ATH). Analysts believe that if SOL clears the $222 mark and maintains its momentum, the next key level to watch is $250. Reclaiming and holding $250 as support would pave the way for Solana to enter uncharted territory, pushing its price into a new all-time high and potentially beginning a price discovery phase. This development would further solidify Solana’s position as a market leader and attract increased investor attention.

Such a pause in price action might delay Solana’s rally but could also provide a foundation for renewed momentum in the future. With market participants closely monitoring these levels, Solana’s price movements in the coming days will be pivotal in determining whether the cryptocurrency embarks on its next major leg up or enters a temporary holding pattern.

The study, published in the International Journal of Bank Marketing, aimed to “investigate the associations between social media usage and cryptocurrency investment behavior.” “Cryptocurrencies have gained popularity among investors despite their high risk and volatility. Social media wields substantial influence over investors’ attitudes, judgments and decisions related to investment.” The study, conducted by researchers Kyoung Tae Kim and Lu Fan, claims to be one of the first of its kind. “This study is one of the initial attempts to examine the role of social media platforms in cryptocurrency investment. The findings offer unique and important theoretical and practical insights for policymakers, researchers and practitioners, which can benefit consumer well-being.” According to the researchers, the study concluded that social media users are more likely to invest in cryptocurrency. “Investors who used social media for investment information were more likely to invest in cryptocurrencies and consider investing in cryptocurrencies in the future. The likelihood increased with the number of social media platforms used. Different social media platforms exhibited distinct associations with cryptocurrency investment experiences and future considerations.” According to researcher Lu Fan , much of the chatter surrounding cryptocurrency originates from and echoes within social media. “A lot of people talk about cryptocurrency on social media and how popular it has become. There are a lot of celebrities talking about this. People are thinking, ‘Because my friends, families and the celebrities I admire all invest in that, maybe I should too.” Fan also highlights a link between youth, social media use, and crypto investments. “Our study showed that the younger adults are more likely to invest in crypto now, and they’re also the majority users of social media. So, when serving those young adults who usually need to gain more financial literacy through life experience and age, there needs to be some guidance as well.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Pepe’s price surges, attention is also shifting to Wall Street Pepe as its presale hits the $50 million mark. Table of Contents PEPE’s next move Wall Street Pepe could be the next PEPE Popular meme coin Pepe (PEPE) witnessed a 12% surge in the past 24 hours, pushing its price to $0.00002028. With a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $1.4 billion, the token is demonstrating significant market activity. The rally comes as the overall crypto market gains momentum, with PEPE securing the 23rd spot by market cap, which now stands at $8.53 billion. Meanwhile, the new frog meme coin Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) hit $50m in what looks to be one of this year’s hottest crypto presales. PEPE’s next move On the technical front, PEPE is trading above its 9-period Simple Moving Average (SMA) of $0.00001980 and its 9-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $0.00002002. These levels signal short-term bullish momentum as the token continues its recovery from recent lows. The Bollinger Bands indicate narrowing volatility, with the price testing the upper band of $0.00002020. This pattern suggests the potential for another breakout if the bullish sentiment persists. Key support for $PEPE stands at $0.00001950, the mid-point of the Bollinger Bands. A drop below this level could see the token retrace toward $0.00001860, potentially reversing the recent upward trend. On the upside, immediate resistance is at $0.00002060, the upper end of its 24-hour range. A breakout past this level could lead to testing the key psychological mark of $0.00002200. Investor confidence in PEPE remains high, as indicated by its robust volume and sharp price movement. If the current bullish momentum holds, $PEPE could be poised for another leg up, but failure to maintain support levels could signal a short-term correction.

Digesting the SEC chairman’s exit interview,https://crypto.news/gary-genslers-political-testament-exit-interview/,"On Jan. 14, 2025, Gary Gensler had a farewell interview on CNBC. On January 20, he will step down as the chairman of the SEC. What were their conclusive words to the crypto community? At the very start of the interview, the host, Andrew Ross Sorkin, makes a remark that sets the context. He notes that even in the last few days of Gensler’s tenure as the SEC chair and launch of the Trump administration 2.0, Robinhood brokers had to settle $45 million SEC charges associated with violations of ten law provisions. Read more: Robinhood hit with $45m SEC settlement over securities violations At that time, Sorkin didn’t know that after the interview, the SEC would rekindle the case against Ripple. Gary Gensler opens the Ripple case yet again. #BreakingNews #CryptoNews #NewsUpdate #Ripple #Trump #ElonMusk #XRPArmy pic.twitter.com/eSYGdkp1jH — Rexla (@RexlaGlobal) January 17, 2025 Sorkin’s smart tone-setting remark paints Gensler as a soldier relentlessly fighting to protect the prehistoric laws from the burgeoning cryptocurrency sector. Let’s see what Gary told the CNBC hosts over various topics during an exit interview. Trump 2.0 as pro-crypto administration Admitting that donors from the crypto field were prominent in sponsoring Trump’s campaign, Gensler noted that the election was not about cryptocurrencies. He mentioned that his predecessor, Jay Clayton, who will serve in the new Trump administration, brought up 80 cases during his past tenure. It seems that Gensler is hinting that the new administration is not going to tolerate lawbreakers, no matter how pro-crypto it is. Gensler’s epitome: cryptos are securities. Period Sorkin pointed out that Gensler, during his tenure, has been battling crypto companies, leaning on the existing laws while not working on creating the laws that would have factored the changing reality in. This question is really genuine as Gensler is known as a person who tends to equate most cryptocurrencies to unregistered securities, which is a very uncomfortable way to perceive crypto for crypto companies. Instead of pushing the new rules to efficiently regulate crypto, Gensler was trying to shove crypto into an already existing law configuration, no matter how inadequate it is for crypto. Mostly, these laws were not created with cryptocurrencies in mind and mostly predating their vast presence. Gensler insists that most cryptocurrency projects must adhere to the laws regulating securities, and in many instances, they fail to comply. Despite the initial interest in Bitcoin , the SEC-era Gensler doesn’t see crypto as something that never existed before and sticks to his guns, repeating a “cryptos are nothing but unregistered securities” mantra. Answering Sorkin’s question, he said crypto is mostly traded leaning on the sentiment and not fundamentals, but if (sic!) the fundamentals are there, crypto companies should make disclosures adhering to the securities laws. Bitcoin is not a security, but other cryptocurrencies are dangerous Gensler said that Bitcoin is not a security now (sic!), but other thousands of cryptocurrencies pose a threat to the investing public, and it’s his duty as a law enforcement agent to protect these people from fraud, money laundering and other crimes. “There has been too much of that in this field,” Gensler said. More than that, he is sure that the exchanges are “trading against their customers.” As for Bitcoin, Gensler compared the first cryptocurrency to gold and noted that it is a highly volatile speculative asset, but people want to trade it. However, Gensler said he cannot predict the future of Bitcoin, and he doesn’t know whether it will have any value in 10 or 20 years from now. Sorkin said that Gensler’s attempts to fight Bitcoin were in vain as at the end of Gensler’s era, Bitcoin was as popular as never before. At the same time, Gensler failed to prevent this great bubble from blowing (if it proved to be a bubble). Twice, Gensler dodged to comment on how he feels about his role in both of these scenarios, none of which portrays him as a winner. Listing his main achievements as the SEC chair, he mentioned reforms in the stock market policy and other sectors not related to cryptocurrencies. Afterword It is interesting how Gary Gensler went from a tech-savvy official genuinely intrigued by the potential of blockchain technology to a rigid gatekeeper in just two years. In 2019, he wrote an inspired editorial on the future of Bitcoin for CoinDesk. In 2021, he became the most notorious cryptocurrency foe in SEC history. A person who famously called stablecoins “poker chips” for gambling, he dedicated his time in the SEC to legal battles with Binance, Coinbase, Ripple, and Gemini while overlooking the FTX collapse. Hopefully, now that he is retiring, he will find peace. He says he never owned any cryptocurrencies. Who knows what’s next for Gensler, will he soften his heart to Bitcoin?

Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, commented on the event with a bold statement on social media. Alderoty suggested that starting Saturday, Gensler would no longer hold relevance in discussions surrounding the US SEC. Gary Gensler’s Last Day as US SEC Chair: Ripple CLO Alderoty Comments In a post on X , Stuart Alderoty, Ripple CLO, mocked Gary Gensler’s departure from the SEC. He remarked that the crypto industry would soon ask, “Gary who?” Alderoty’s comments come amidst Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC, which began in 2020. The SEC has alleged that Ripple sold XRP as an unregistered security, a claim the company has denied. Despite the XRP company’s partial court victory in 2023, where the judge ruled that XRP sales to retail investors did not violate securities laws. However, the US SEC appealed the decision prolonging uncertainty for Ripple and the crypto industry. In recent reports on the XRP lawsuit , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an appeal challenging the district court’s 2023 ruling that XRP is not a security. The SEC argues that all XRP transactions, including programmatic sales to retail investors, qualify as investment contracts under the Howey Test. Gary Gensler’s legacy as SEC Chair is marked by an aggressive approach to regulating the crypto industry. Under his leadership, the SEC initiated over 80 lawsuits against crypto companies, including prominent names such as Coinbase, Uniswap, and Ripple. Despite the controversies, Gensler claimed that crypto enforcement accounted for only a small portion of the SEC’s overall activities. Supporters of his tenure highlighted efforts to protect investors and enforce compliance across the financial sector. The former US SEC chair shared a video on X, reflecting on the four years in office. It has been the privilege of a lifetime to work for you as @SECGov Chair.

Analysts noted the formation of a bullish pennant pattern on XRP’s weekly price chart. The pattern, often indicative of strong upward momentum, has led some analysts to forecast a potential short-term target of $10. Source: TradingView The bullish outlook is boosted by improved market sentiment surrounding Ripple’s chances in its legal battle with the SEC. Market participants remain optimistic about the possibility of reduced regulatory pressure under the Trump administration. Additionally, recent price analysis supports the bullish outlook for XRP , with targets of $5, $10, $15, and $20 in sight. The ongoing rally is fueled by strong technical patterns like the “bull flag” and increased open interest, which recently hit $7.51 billion. Whale accumulation has also intensified, indicating growing investor confidence. Anticipation Grows for XRP ETF Approval More so analysts at JPMorgan broke silence on XRP ETF possibilities, forecasting an inflow of $3 billion to $8 billion if approved by the SEC. The prediction is based on adoption rates similar to BTC and Ether ETFs, which captured 6% and 3% of their market caps, respectively, within their early months. The report highlights the potential for XRP and Solana ETFs to boost liquidity and market adoption. At press time, the Ripple token is trading at $3.27, marking a 39.71% gain over the past 7 days. The cryptocurrency’s market cap stands at $188.16 billion, with a 24-hour trading volume of $13.8 billion.

The San Francisco-based blockchain company Ripple is marking the occasion with enthusiasm. Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s chief legal officer, took to social media, remarking , “Starting tomorrow, ‘Gary who?’ will be the only appropriate response if someone mentions his name. Onward.” Gesler’s aggressive stance The SEC filed its opening brief in the appeal of its ongoing lawsuit with Ripple earlier this week. The case in question was based on the perceived nature of XRP as a security and has been widely discussed in the cryptocurrency industry. Ripple, however, appears unfazed. Alderoty called the latest legal action “noise,” suggesting that the SEC’s new leadership could adopt a new approach. He also noted that the case could be deferred, as there were reports that certain cryptocurrency-related enforcement actions without fraud claims could be suspended. The appeal comes as the SEC, under Gensler, has been accused of being overly aggressive in the legal arena by many industry participants. Ripple’s lawyer, John Deaton, who is actively involved in the case against the SEC, has also slammed Gensler for his leadership.

Deaton, however, said that there may be changes under the new chair, Paul Atkins, who is a nominee of President-elect Donald Trump. Akins is expected to pause some activities against cryptocurrency companies, which will be favourable to Ripple. According to the reports, the SEC under Atkins intends to allow more cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Analysts predict that the probability of the approval of an XRP ETF in 2025 is 66% which could lead to over $8 billion of inflows. Gensler became the SEC chairman in 2021, and there were high hopes that he would be more receptive to cryptocurrencies due to his experience teaching blockchain and crypto at MIT. At first, some people in the industry, including Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, applauded his appointment. However, his time in the role has been marked by controversy, as the SEC has sued numerous major crypto firms. It has been the privilege of a lifetime to work for you as @SECGov Chair.

He called his four years at the helm of the SEC “the privilege of a lifetime.” Trump administration and XRP surge The regulatory landscape could see a major change under President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to fire Gensler and adopt more lax market rules. Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse has been constantly in touch with the new administration and reportedly had a meeting with Trump at Mar-a-Lago this month. According to reports, Garlinghouse proposed the concept of a federal crypto reserve that would include XRP and Bitcoin. However, Ripple has not confirmed these discussions. Despite the prevailing legal ambiguities, XRP has given impressive results. The cryptocurrency recently spiked to $3.23, coming close to its previous record of $3.40 set in 2018. In the past week alone, XRP has jumped by more than 40%, with higher-value transactions and the number of holders on the rise. Currently, XRP is trading at $3.28, having risen by 2% in the last 24 hours. According to Analytics firm Santiment, there were 2,365 XRP transactions worth more than $100,000 within a day for eight hours. Also, over 500,000 new XRP wallets have been created in the last two months, which speaks about the continuing interest in the token. 📈 XRP has just reached a new 7-year high, crossing a $3.39 market value for the first time since January, 2018.

These programs provide returns in the form of three cryptocurrencies associated with Nova Labs: Helium Network Token (HNT) Helium Mobile Network Token (MOBILE) Helium IoT Network Token (IOT) The SEC alleges that these activities qualify as unregistered securities offerings and violate federal securities regulations that require issuers to disclose important financial and operational details to protect investors.

XRP, Cardano (ADA), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have established themselves as top contenders, but a new player, Lightchain AI, is quickly emerging as a project that could outpace them all. Currently priced at $0.00525 and having raised over $10.6 million during its presale, Lightchain AI, is attracting significant attention from investors looking for high-growth opportunities. XRP strengths and challenges Traditional international transactions often take several days to complete, with high fees due to multiple intermediaries. In contrast, Ripple’s system enables near-instant transfers, reducing wait times to mere seconds. This speed is achieved by using XRP as a bridge currency, simplifying exchanges and eliminating the need for pre-funded accounts. However, challenges remain, particularly around regulatory scrutiny from agencies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has cast uncertainty on XRP’s classification and future role in financial systems. Although Ripple’s network has expanded, its widespread adoption by conventional banks is still a work in progress. Addressing these issues is crucial for Ripple to solidify XRP’s position in transforming global money transfers.

In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 23:50:00

The SEC accused DCG and Genesis of defrauding investors through misrepresentation, resulting in penalties and legal action. DCG agreed to settle the charges by paying a $38 million fine. SEC Reveals Accounting Tricks Behind DCG’s ‘Strong’ Balance Sheet Claims On January 17, the SEC ordered DCG to pay a $38 million civil penalty and issued a cease-and-desist order to prevent future misconduct. The charges extend to DCG and its former CEO, Soichiro “Michael” Moro, who allegedly misled investors about the financial health of Genesis following the collapse of one of its largest borrowers, Three Arrows Capital (3AC), in mid-2022. The U.S. SEC has charged Digital Currency Group (DCG) and its subsidiary Genesis Global Capital for allegedly concealing significant financial risks arising from the default of Three Arrows Capital in 2022 by disseminating false or misleading information. DCG has been fined $38… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 17, 2025 Moro, who served as CEO of Genesis during this period, was accused of approving misleading public statements and tweets that downplayed financial risks. According to the SEC, Moro authorized posts claiming that Genesis had “shed the risk” associated with 3AC’s default and maintained a “strong” balance sheet, despite the company’s precarious position. Additionally, Moro signed a $1.1 billion promissory note on behalf of Genesis, which the SEC described as perpetuating a false narrative about the company’s financial health. As part of the enforcement action, Moro was fined $500,000 and barred from engaging in any negligent conduct that could mislead investors. The SEC indicated that its findings against Moro could support ongoing investor lawsuits and regulatory actions. The SEC also revealed that DCG executives were aware of over $1 billion in losses at Genesis but sought to portray financial stability. DCG issued a $1.1 billion promissory note to Genesis, described by the SEC as an “accounting asset” with no tangible capital transfer. These actions, coupled with undisclosed terms of the note, misled investors about the company’s true financial state. By June 30, 2022, Genesis reported positive equity, but the company’s financial pressures continued to mount. By November 2022, it suspended withdrawals, affecting customers of Gemini Earn and locking up $900 million in user assets. Genesis and DCG Struggle with Fallout from 2022 Collapse The financial troubles of Genesis began with the collapse of 3AC, which triggered liquidity issues, and worsened with the implosion of FTX later that year. In January 2023, Genesis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy , disclosing over $3.5 billion in debts to its top 50 creditors, including major names like Gemini and VanEck. Genesis’ parent company, DCG, borrowed $500 million across four loans in 2022. However, by May 2023, DCG had failed to repay $620 million, including 4,550 Bitcoin, prompting Genesis to file a lawsuit seeking full repayment plus fees. You might also like Genesis Sues Parent Firm DCG Over $600 Million Loan Repayment In November 2023, DCG reached a settlement to repay the loans by April 2024, offering Genesis some relief in its bankruptcy proceedings. By February 2024, Genesis and Gemini had reached a settlement to distribute $1.8 billion to users of Gemini Earn, pending court approval. By May 2024, Genesis had distributed $2.18 billion worth of cryptocurrency to approximately 232,000 users, advancing its bankruptcy process. Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is pursuing penalties and corrective measures against Gemini Trust, with its trial now set for January 21, 2025. This legal battle adds to the ongoing scrutiny faced by companies tied to DCG and Genesis.

In a recent interview with Cointelegraph, Filbfilb shared insights on Bitcoin’s trajectory amid a recovering market and incoming political changes in the U.S. Trump Administration and Bitcoin Market Dynamics After rebounding from two-month lows, Bitcoin is trading above $100,000 as of Jan. 17, according to Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView data. Filbfilb believes the Trump administration’s pro-Bitcoin stance could boost the market. However, potential trade wars could disrupt the broader risk-asset rally. Despite these uncertainties, Filbfilb predicts Bitcoin will maintain its leadership in the crypto market, possibly achieving record dominance. He remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s ability to outperform equities if favorable policies are enacted quickly. Short-Term Expectations and Market Reactions In response to potential unmet expectations regarding executive orders, Filbfilb said, “I had anticipated a bumpy open to the year with a recovery in the second part of the month, which is what we have seen so far.” While Bitcoin’s current price reflects cautious optimism, he noted, “If something like this is ruled out, I’m sure there would be a dip, but probably an overreaction and perhaps an opportunity.” MicroStrategy and Bitcoin Correlation Discussing MicroStrategy’s stock performance, Filbfilb dismissed claims of it being a “ponzi scheme” but acknowledged its risks. “At present, the premium over net asset value (NAV) is around 2, similar to levels seen when Bitcoin consolidated around $60,000-$70,000,” he explained. If Bitcoin surpasses $100,000, he expects MicroStrategy’s stock to surge, driven by increased interest in Bitcoin. “Short term, I’m not too concerned about a major retracement for MSTR, unless there is a big pullback in Bitcoin,” he added. Long-term concerns about MicroStrategy’s debt servicing are noted but remain a topic for the future.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-17 23:59:00

For savvy investors, now is the time to stay ahead of the curve. Indeed, there has been news about the Dogecoin price reaching new heights. However, altcoins like WallitIQ (WLTQ) , Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Myro (MYRO) have entered the market with the life-changing potential of turning your $550 into $550,000. Keep reading to understand why these four altcoins are set to skyrocket before the Dogecoin price hits $1. Stock Market Genius Confirms That WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Rise By 1,000x And Dominate The Crypto Market In 2025 WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) upcoming 1,000x rise proves one thing — it is a financial revolution, not just another altcoin. This crypto uses artificial intelligence to make your trading experience convenient. You can trade up to 1,000 cryptocurrencies from one wallet. Priced at just $0.0420 , buying as little as $550 worth of the token now will bring you a whopping $550,000 in returns shortly. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) intuitive Crypto Wallet Management Mobile App has been designed to streamline your wallet and transaction management. There are display QR codes for wallet addresses to receive payments easily. You get access to live market data because of the CoinGecko API integration. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) transaction features include simulated crypto transfers for day-to-day purchases like Starbucks coffee subscriptions.

With its staking rewards of up to 180% APY , you can earn passive income by simply holding WallitIQ (WLTQ). Even the Dogecoin price that stands above WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) $0.0420 cannot compete with this feature. Safety is paramount to crypto investment, and this altcoin delivers. SolidProof has completed WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) smart contract audit to secure your investment. This altcoin’s robust security and growing community contributed to it crossing the one-million-dollar mark just weeks after the presale started. Timing is everything in the crypto world.

Pepe (PEPE) recently broke out of an ascending triangle pattern, which signals a further upside. Pepe’s (PEPE) RSI points to buying pressure, and experts speculate Pepe (PEPE) might achieve exponential gains before the Dogecoin price hits $1. Bonk (BONK) Signals A Potential Breakout Following Its Recent Rally Following its rally that peaked in Q4 last year, Bonk (BONK) has entered a corrective phase. If Bonk (BONK) holds this support and breaks above the wedge resistance, it might experience a breakout. Thus, speculative upward movement in Bonk (BONK) is expected to outpace the Dogecoin price to $1. However, failure to hold this support could lead to a deeper correction for Bonk (BONK). Experts Say Myro (MYRO) Can Deliver 30x Returns In 2025 Currently trading between $0.0618 and $0.0966, Myro (MYRO) shows resilience despite its 13% dip last month. Myro (MYRO) has had a solid 14% growth in the past six months, and it positioned close to its 10-day simple moving average of $0.1491, showing a 55% surge in Myro (MYRO). If Myro (MYRO) maintains this trajectory, it can surpass the Dogecoin price to deliver 30x returns this year. Conclusion Pepe (PEPE), Bonk (BONK), and Myro (MYRO) are showing signs of impressive growth. However, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is set to dominate all of them with its 1,000x rally. As such, it is understandable that a stock market genius is lauding its potential and credibility. Time is ticking, and the presale is the only chance you have to secure this altcoin at just $0.0420 . Do not waste one more second!

According to insights from Dom (@traderview2), an experienced overflow, volume, and profile trader, this rally diverges from the typical behavior observed in Bitcoin and other assets. It signals genuine demand for the token rather than speculative trading, offering a promising outlook for XRP and the broader market. This demand has been reflected in XRP’s price, as the digital asset recently climbed to $3.39, its highest price since 2018. In a series of analyses supported by technical charts, Dom emphasizes the importance of the spot premium and funding rates remaining unchanged despite the recent upward price movement. “This rally continues to be driven entirely by spot buying,” Dom stated, highlighting the uniqueness of this XRP movement compared to Bitcoin’s often futures-led price surges. It’s absolutely insane to see that $XRP funding rates and spot premium still haven’t moved This rally continues to be driven entirely by spot buying (see 2nd pic), this proves real demand for actual coins This isn’t just another perp-led rally like we always see with $BTC … https://t.co/cMpxOisv76 pic.twitter.com/7bUzGC2eo8 — Dom (@traderview2) January 15, 2025 Real Demand Fuels XRP Growth The charts highlight robust buying pressure on XRP’s spot market, which indicates real demand for the cryptocurrency. This is a notable departure from the behavior of perpetual swaps or leveraged trading, where funding rates typically spike as traders speculate on price movements. In XRP’s case, the absence of significant changes in funding rates reinforces the notion that this rally is backed by buyers seeking actual tokens rather than short-term profits. The significance of this development also extends beyond XRP. XRP has been displaying unusual signs in its price surges, and a market rally driven by spot purchases often reflects increased confidence in the asset, signaling a broader shift in sentiment among investors. Such trends are critical in fostering long-term growth and stability for cryptocurrencies. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 What’s Next For the Market and XRP XRP’s spot-led rally marks a pivotal moment for the token and the cryptocurrency industry. It serves as an indicator of shifting market dynamics, where speculative futures trading plays a lesser role in driving asset value. This move may attract more institutional and retail investors, offering them confidence in XRP’s utility and resilience. For XRP specifically, this momentum could be linked to the shift in the U.S. political landscape after Donald Trump’s election victory in November, and the excitement surrounding the upcoming resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Increasing adoption and utility in cross-border payments and blockchain solutions also play a significant role, as the token’s role in facilitating efficient and cost-effective transactions has been a key value proposition for years. Dom concludes that this trend could signify much higher price levels for XRP. “If I saw this with BTC, I would simply say we are going much higher,” Dom noted, suggesting that the rally may be far from over.

Its trading volume is also up by 10.58%, reflecting strong market interest. Launched in November 2023, this dog-inspired coin built on Solana has achieved impressive growth in a short time.

It is now trading above $103,000. This marks an 8% gain over the past week, driven by growing interest from large investors and a shift in market dynamics. According to the latest insights from CryptoQuant Analysts, some underlying whale activity factors might be influencing Bitcoin’s current trajectory. Related Reading: Rising Bitcoin Prices Defy Exchange Inflows: What Investors Need to Know Bitcoin Price Rebounds Amid Growing Whale Activity CryptoQuant QuickTake Platform contributor Joao Wedson has recently highlighted a noteworthy trend in whale behavior on Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange. In a recent analysis, Wedson examined the Exchange Whale Ratio, which measures the share of Bitcoin’s largest inflow transactions relative to the total exchange volume. This metric, according to the analyst has now reached historical highs, signaling that large holders—often referred to as whales—are transferring significant amounts of Bitcoin to the exchange. The increased movement of Bitcoin by whales may indicate that they are preparing for substantial buy or sell actions, potentially amplifying market volatility. Wedson added: Stay alert! Intense movements by major players can bring volatility risks but also unique opportunities for those closely monitoring the market. Understanding New Whale Movements and Market Cycles In addition to whale activity on Binance, another CryptoQuant contributor, KriptoBaykusV2, provided insights into the emergence of new large investors in the market. According to KriptoBaykusV2, the “New Whales” indicator highlights the influx of previously inactive large investors acquiring Bitcoin. Over the past three years, this metric has grown steadily, suggesting heightened interest in the cryptocurrency market. However, the entry and exit of new whales often coincide with price swings, making it a key factor for understanding market cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin May Target $145,000 To $249,000 Under Trump Administration: Report Historical data shows that peaks in new whale activity often align with periods of price volatility. For example, during 2021 and 2023, sharp increases in the number of new large investors were followed by significant price corrections.

The study, published in the International Journal of Bank Marketing, aims to analyze the influence of social media on investors’ behaviour towards cryptocurrencies. The research done by Kyoung Tae Kim and Lu Fan investigates the connection between time spent on social media and the propensity of people to invest in cryptocurrencies. The study shows that social media significantly influences investment decisions, including risky ones such as cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies remain rather popular, even though they are characterized by high fluctuations. This study demonstrates that social media is one of the key determinants of investors’ perceptions and behaviour. The study also shows that investors who gain their information through social media are likely to invest in cryptocurrencies and view future investment in this area positively. The role of social media platforms One of the key insights of the research is the differential effect of different social media platforms on cryptocurrency investment behaviour. The study revealed that the probability of people investing in cryptocurrency grows with the number of platforms used. Some platforms seem to promote a higher level of confidence when it comes to investing, as conversations regarding cryptocurrency are often enough to sway users. According to one of the researchers, Lu Fan, the discussion surrounding cryptocurrencies has been on the rise, especially with the celebrities on social networks. He notes that many people are motivated by the desire to imitate their friends and relatives or even celebrities who also invest in the same business. Youth and financial literacy The study also shows that there is one significant pattern among young people. This study showed that the younger population is not only the main consumer of social media but also the main investor in cryptocurrencies. However, this group might not be well informed on financial matters, which may make them very sensitive to social media influence. Fan underscores the need for young adults, especially those who lack sufficient experience in handling money, to be well-guided in making the right investment decisions. He points out that while information on social media can be useful, it can also lead to investment decisions made based on hype rather than knowledge of the financial markets. The number of young adults investing in cryptocurrencies is on the rise every day across the globe. According to Bappebti, Indonesia’s commodity futures trading regulatory agency, 62% of Indonesia’s crypto investors were between 18 and 30 years old as of October 2024. This trend is in line with young people from Indonesia investing in cryptocurrencies, with 26.9% of investors being 18-24 years old and 35.1% being 25-30 years old. According to a study from Bitget Research, Generation Z and the Millennial generation are becoming more interested in cryptocurrencies. The research further found that 20% of Gen Z is the most targeted group of crypto scams. However, this group is still interested in crypto and its opportunities, especially as a means of payment. Cryptocurrency adoption This is not a trend that is limited to Asia only, as more and more young people are using cryptocurrencies. Telegram-based crypto communities in Africa expanded by 189% from the beginning of 2023 to 2024, and over 56% of its users are below 25 years old. Young people in Europe are also participating, with 32% of Millennials and 29% of Gen Z investing in cryptocurrencies, according to a 2024 study by Bitpanda and YouGov. Cryptocurrency adoption is also increasing at a faster rate than both mobile phones and the internet worldwide. According to BlackRock’s Jay Jacobs, mobile phones took 21 years and the internet 15 years to garner 300 million users, while cryptocurrencies reached the same number in just 12 years. Bitcoin stands out with a $2 trillion market cap and still leads the industry as the demand for decentralized assets grows in a digital economy.

As Ethereum struggles, ETH Whales are dumping their ETH and turning to PropiChain (PCHAIN) , an AI altcoin defying the bearish market trend. PCHAIN has surged from $0.004 to $0.011, drawing comparisons with Ethereum’s early rise. Experts believe PropiChain’s innovative DeFi solutions could rival Ethereum, with some predicting a price above $2 by 2025. Ethereum Whales are looking to capitalize on PCHAIN’s growth potential as it gains traction among top AI altcoins. Ethereum Decline Gets Steeper, the Drop Could Continue Ethereum price has dropped 19.16% over the last 30 days, with ETH now testing the $3,000 support level. This marks the first time since November 2024 that Ethereum has fallen this low. While 74.7% of Ethereum addresses belong to long-term holders, signaling commitment, many are eager for a market rebound. Despite the bullish Ethereum price prediction, the charts suggest ETH could see further declines, possibly reaching $2,800 or even $2,569 before any upward movement occurs. Ethereum remains unpredictable, but ETH Whales are hoping things will get better. PropiChain’s Crypto Presale: A Golden Opportunity for ETH Whales PropiChain’s crypto presale is rapidly gaining attention, particularly among ETH whales looking for new opportunities. In its second stage, tokens are priced at $0.011, making it a prime entry point for early investors. The presale has already raised nearly $2 million, with 45.14% of the tokens sold in stage 2, highlighting the growing demand for this emerging AI altcoin. The project has earned additional credibility through a thorough security audit by BlockAudit and a listing on CoinMarketCap . These milestones reinforce PropiChain’s position as a transparent and trustworthy investment. PropiChain is drawing increasing interest as an AI altcoin because of its potential to disrupt the crypto landscape and offer long-term growth opportunities. PropiChain’s Vision: A Blending AI Innovation and RWA Tokenomics PropiChain is revolutionizing the real estate industry by integrating blockchain technology with artificial intelligence (AI). This innovative approach addresses the challenges of high capital requirements and illiquidity in traditional real estate markets. By blending AI with blockchain, PropiChain enhances property management, trading, and investment processes, offering investors a more efficient and accessible platform. A standout feature of this AI altcoin is its fractional ownership model. Through tokenization, investors can own a portion of high-value properties without substantial upfront capital. This democratizes access to real estate investments, allowing individuals to participate in the market with lower financial barriers. Such a model can transform the real estate sector, making it more inclusive and liquid, thus drawing the Ethereum Whales. In addition to fractional ownership, PropiChain is embracing the metaverse to create immersive digital experiences. Users can virtually explore properties, attend interactive conferences, and connect with other investors in a fully immersive digital space. This metaverse integration enhances user engagement and provides a novel way to interact with real estate assets, aligning with the growing trend of virtual environments in various industries. Furthermore, this AI altcoin’s AI integration offers advanced tools for intelligent decision-making. The platform provides actionable insights, evaluates properties, and identifies emerging market trends, simplifying the complexities of investing. By utilizing AI, this AI altcoin empowers investors with accurate, up-to-date information tailored to their goals, enhancing the overall investment experience.

The New York Post, citing anonymous sources, reports that Trump is “receptive” to the idea of a national strategic reserve with Solana, XRP and the stablecoin USDC . All three assets were developed in association with blockchain projects that are headquartered in the US. Trump met with Ripple’s chief executive Brad Garlinghouse and chief legal officer Stuart Alderoty last week. The New York Post reports that the president-elect also met with the “founders” of Solana and USDC.

Chicago-based business owner Milan Jackson says it all started when she received a phone call from someone who claimed to work at the bank, reports ABC 7. The man on the phone said someone was trying to take $20,000 from Jackson’s account, warning she needed to act fast to stop the transfer. Jackson says the man’s phone number matched the number on the back of her BofA debit card, which made the call seem legitimate. The imposter told Jackson to protect her money by wiring $20,000 to a different account, and soon after the transaction was sent she began to realize something was wrong. “I get this weird feeling, and so I go into Bank of America, and they confirm that this is a scam. I shut the phone off. I’m hysterically crying… I can’t believe this is my life. How did this happen and how am I going to get this money back?” The FBI calls this type of theft “the phantom hacker,” and special agent Rachel LaRocque says these types of scams are growing more sophisticated. “They may even be able to spoof that bank’s phone number, so the number on your caller ID or cell phone might show that it’s the bank. Scammers do not discriminate against anyone. They want money from anyone they can take it from.” In cases like these, Bank of America says it tries to claw back funds but is not responsible for the theft. The bank says it will never call customers and ask them to send money or a wire transfer.

Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) could become the next viral memecoin. Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) by entering its contract address – GmW5qPRZ4TfoTw6U1KL9Btxn1uqXJJhieMAfeJk4wkbg – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPAI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-18 01:12:00

Bitcoin (BTC) still leads the charge, but altcoins are capturing attention. From Ethereum (ETH) to the dynamic BigBossInu, these digital currencies are ready to thrive as market momentum builds. BigBossInu: Leading the Crypto Revolution with Its Explosive Presale BigBossInu is revolutionizing the crypto market, with its presale attracting significant investor interest and generating major excitement. Positioned as a high-reward opportunity, it offers early investors a strategic advantage to secure exceptional rewards. With a visionary roadmap and cutting-edge features, BigBossInu is quickly becoming one of the hottest cryptos to follow, creating waves in the space with ambitious growth plans. BIGBOSSINU celebrates $100,000 raised within minutes! For a l imited time , get a 50% EXTRA BONUS by using the code EXTRA50X . Don’t miss out! >> Ethereum (ETH) : Ethereum’s price has seen gains recently, closely following the U.S. stock market indexes hitting record highs. Despite a sideways consolidation over the past week, ETH is approaching the final phase of a bullish fractal pattern, which could lead to a 40% increase in price if confirmed. Solana (SOL) : Solana is eyeing a long-term price target of $600, potentially riding the broader crypto bull run led by Bitcoin. The network has seen significant growth in its ecosystem, including a new all-time high in liquid staking above $5.7 billion and an increase in average daily transaction volumes for NFTs and decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Optimism (OP) : Generally, Optimism’s price is tied to its progress in scaling Ethereum and the adoption of layer-2 solutions, which help in reducing transaction costs and increasing throughput for the Ethereum blockchain. Litecoin (LTC) : Historically, LTC’s performance often moves in tandem with Bitcoin, acting as a “digital silver.” Litecoin is still relevant for payments due to its faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to Bitcoin. >> Conclusion With the crypto market gearing up for a rally, altcoins like BigBossInu, Ethereum, Solana, Optimism, and Litecoin offer significant opportunities for growth by 2025. BigBossInu’s presale, Ethereum’s bullish signals, Solana’s expanding ecosystem, Optimism’s layer-2 adoption, and Litecoin’s payment strength highlight their potential. These assets could help build a substantial portfolio, but thorough research and risk management are essential in navigating the volatile market.

Republican Senator Peter Durant of Worcester County has introduced legislation to create a “Commonwealth Bitcoin Strategic Reserve.” This proposal marks a pivotal shift for a state traditionally known as a Democratic stronghold. Massachusetts Targets BTC Adoption With Strategic Reserve Proposal State Senator Peter Durant has filed a bill advocating for the establishment of a Bitcoin reserve. The proposed “Commonwealth Bitcoin Strategic Reserve” aims to allocate up to 10% of the state’s $9 billion stabilization fund toward Bitcoin and other digital assets. The legislation specifies that funds used for the reserve must be unspent, uncommitted, or unencumbered, ensuring no interference with existing financial obligations. Senator Durant emphasized that the reserve would not replace traditional investments but act as a supplementary strategy. Additionally, the proposed reserve offers flexibility by permitting the state treasury to loan Bitcoin and other assets under its control. This provision will generate additional returns while maintaining a balanced financial risk profile. More so, the Massachusetts bill permits the use of qualified custodians or exchange-traded products (ETPs) to achieve these digital assets. The move is in line with the trend that has been realized in the acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a form of conducting business. Bitcoin adoption has been steadily growing, with increasing interest from major companies. Recently, MicroStrategy, one of the biggest institutional Bitcoin investors, unveiled plans to further enhance its Bitcoin strategy . The company suggested raising its Class A share capital to 10.3 billion in order to obtain more BTC. Implications of the Bitcoin Reserve Strategy Massachusetts joins other U.S. states, such as Texas and Pennsylvania, in considering Bitcoin reserves. At the federal level, there are discussions about including digital assets in national reserves under the incoming Trump administration. These initiatives highlight the increasing recognition of Bitcoin’s role in financial strategies across the nation. The Massachusetts bill also reflects a larger trend in cryptocurrency adoption, with countries like Hong Kong and Germany exploring similar reserves. Additionally, a recent report revealed Wyoming’s proposal to invest state funds in Bitcoin through House Bill 0201 (HB0201). This bill will allocate up to 3% of qualifying state funds to Bitcoin investments, including direct purchases and regulated Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs). The proposal builds on Wyoming’s track record of enacting over two dozen blockchain-friendly laws since 2018. Meanwhile, crypto industry leaders are optimistic that Donald Trump will announce a strategic Bitcoin reserve on his inauguration day, January 20. They believe this move could set a precedent, encouraging other nations to explore Bitcoin reserves as part of their financial strategies.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Analyzing 5 altcoins with the potential to outshine Bitcoin’s recent rally. Table of Contents XYZ to take the meme coin championship Cardano BNB Ethereum XRP Conclusion Bitcoin’s recent surge is capturing attention, but other cryptocurrencies might offer even greater rewards. Five altcoins are poised to outperform Bitcoin’s rally, and this article uncovers these rising stars. XYZ to take the meme coin championship XYZ is stepping into the crypto ring, delivering KO punches to scam projects, farming flops, and low-value tokens. As the first-ever sports-focused meme coin, it’s blazing through the market like a true champion, setting its sights on a 75x growth. XYZ is redefining the game with XYZVerse by blending sports excitement with meme-driven energy. Packed with entertainment-focused dApps, XYZ is pulling millions of sports fans into the fold, creating a winning combination of sports hype and crypto innovation. XYZ is gearing up to dominate the GameFi scene, potentially delivering even bigger wins to its stakeholders through the perfect fusion of meme power, sports passion, and crypto adoption. Missed out on BOME’s 5,000% rally or WIF’s 1,000% surge? XYZ is primed to leave those gains in the dust. Positioned to surge over 7,400% by TGE, it’s poised to become the GOAT of meme coins. XYZVerse isn’t just a platform — it’s a movement. By empowering its community to steer the project, XYZ will reward active contributors with exclusive airdropped tokens. With string tokenomics, planned CEX/DEX listings, and continuous token burns, XYZ is primed for a championship run, ensuring a positive price trajectory and an engaged, thriving community. Interested investors can join the XYZ presale for its 9,900% knockout opportunity. You might also like: XYZVerse could be the second chance for those who missed Bitcoin Cardano Cardano recently rebounded above $1, signaling renewed bullish momentum as the broader crypto market experiences a surge. The crypto is currently trading at $1.13, with a 24-hour increase of around 3%. Notably, analysts highlight that ADA is currently trading within a pennant pattern. With the pennant’s upper resistance and lower support lines converging, a breakout appears imminent. If ADA breaches the nearest resistance level at $1.50, it could target a price of $1.74, marking a substantial gain from its current levels and further solidifying its position in the market. BNB BNB is trading at $717, confined within an uptrend line and the $745 overhead resistance. Analysts suggest that while bulls may attempt to breach the $745 level, it could act as a strong barrier. A sharp rejection at this resistance might drive the BNB/USDT pair toward its moving averages. However, a strong rebound from the moving averages could enhance the chances of a breakout above $745, potentially propelling the price to $794. A bearish turn with a break below the uptrend line would invalidate this positive outlook and signal further downside risks. You might also like: XYZVerse aims to outpace DOGE and SHIB with 15,000% growth Ethereum Ethereum was trading at $3,466 at the time of writing, denoting an increase of 3.43% in 24 hours and 6.61% in the past week. Ethereum’s recovery to $3,466.67 from the neckline of a head-and-shoulders pattern is encountering resistance in the zone between the moving averages. The 20-day EMA at $3,380 and the RSI near the midpoint indicate a balance between supply and demand. A break and close above $3,745 could shift momentum to buyers, potentially driving the ETH/USDT pair to rally toward $4,094. However, a decline below the neckline may invalidate this bullish outlook, potentially pulling the price down to $2,850, where buyers are expected to reenter. XRP Since the 2024 U.S. election, XRP’s price has surged by 460%, reflecting strong market sentiment. With XRP now gaining significant attention, Messari analyst Sam Ruskin recently suggested it could surpass Ethereum in value soon. This optimism is driven by several factors, including Donald Trump entering office, the buzz around a potential XRP ETF filing, and growing investor interest in “boomer coins” like XRP. Ruskin predicts that these events could lead to a 35-50% price increase for XRP, potentially narrowing the gap with Ethereum’s market capitalization. Conclusion ADA, BNB, ETH, and XRP are promising, but XYZ, the first all-sport meme coin uniting fans, aims for massive growth and could outshine them all.

This burn process involved 9,982,673,247,009.8082 $HTX tokens, with a total value exceeding $22.47 million. The burn was carried out on-chain to ensure transparency, and users can verify the burn details via the transaction hash . For more details on the burn, please read HTX DAO’s official announcement: https://htxdao-1.gitbook.io/announcement-en Achieving Record-Breaking Burn under Updated Mechanism In Q3 2024, HTX DAO made a significant adjustment to its burn mechanism based on feedback from its governance committee and community members. The portion of $HTX tokens previously used for liquidity pledges are now directly burned. This shift is expected to substantially increase burn efficiency and support the long-term value appreciation of $HTX. The latest burn marks the second execution under the updated mechanism. According to statistics, HTX DAO has burned a total of 49.63 trillion $HTX tokens in 2024, with the combined value of pledges and burns reaching approximately $95.22 million. This accomplishment underscores the platform’s dedication to reducing the circulating supply. It also demonstrates HTX DAO’s commitment to fostering stronger community consensus and driving sustainable ecosystem growth. Driving Long-term Growth Through Token Burns As stipulated by the burn mechanism, HTX DAO will burn 50% of HTX’s quarterly revenue in $HTX tokens. This strategy meets the community’s expectations regarding token value management while further solidifying HTX DAO’s credibility and transparency in governance. Regular token burns not only support the development of the $HTX deflationary model but also boosts confidence among community members. By reducing the circulating supply, this mechanism helps balance supply and demand, stabilize market prices, and increase the appeal of holding $HTX for the long term. The HTX DAO Committee has stated that the ongoing implementation of the burn plan will enhance the scarcity of $HTX tokens and, through an improved ecosystem, provide more stable, long-term returns for platform users and investors. Shaping the Future of the Ecosystem Through Community Consensus As platform services continue to improve and the user base grows, the value and impact of HTX DAO’s quarterly burn mechanism will become even more apparent. The next burn is scheduled for April 15, 2025. The burn amount will be determined based on HTX’s revenue in Q1 2025. Since its establishment, HTX DAO has focused on building a user-centric blockchain ecosystem founded on transparency, efficiency, and vitality. Moving forward, HTX DAO will continue engaging with community members to enhance governance mechanisms. Through transparent governance and efficient management, the platform will adopt sustainable growth strategies to create long-term value for users and communities. HTX DAO looks forward to collaborating with ecosystem partners and global users to build a more stable, open, and dynamic blockchain environment.

However, altcoin investors are turning to crypto AI agents like Propichain (PCHAIN) which offers affordable inroads to the housing sector. Read on to see why Propichain might become the next top crypto AI asset. Analysts Say Solana and Ethereum Could Lead the Next Altcoin Season Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) holders are looking forward to a strong recovery after recent expert predictions for the altcoin market. Many top crypto assets have faced price declines over the past few weeks as Bitcoin has struggled to return to the $100k region. While Solana (SOL) and Ethereum (ETH) have faced similar price corrections, analysts say both tokens could spark the next altcoin boom. Solana currently trades at $187.35 after a 4.93% decline in the past week. Ethereum also sells at $3,244.74, with a 2.63% decline over the same period. Despite this drop, analysts expect Solana and Ethereum to lead the altcoin recovery. Both tokens have strong DeFi ecosystems backed by high trading activity. Furthermore, if Bitcoin returns to $100k before February, this could further propel a strong price increase for Solana and Ethereum. Bitcoin’s price movement often sets the tone for the broader crypto market, impacting altcoin performance, including Solana and Ethereum. Propichain: Using AI Agents to Expand Profit Opportunities in the Housing Sector The altcoin ecosystem is gearing up for another major entry with the upcoming launch of Propichain (PCHAIN). Built on Ethereum, Propichain is a 21st-century answer to problems that have always plagued the housing sector. Propichain pulls together asset tokenization, artificial intelligence, and metaverse technology, creating an ecosystem where investors of all budget sizes can find profitable investing opportunities. Propichain’s (PCHAIN) asset tokenization reduces the financial costs of becoming a real estate investor. Many willing participants are discouraged by the significantly high capital requirements. Propichain’s fractional ownership model reduces capital barriers, empowering users to invest in smaller shares rather than entire properties. Imagine owning a slice of your dream property without breaking the bank, thanks to Propichain’s revolutionary approach to real estate investing. Propichain follows up its reduced investing costs with streamlined investing tools that leverage artificial intelligence technology. These AI-backed tools help investors with market analysis, asset valuation, and trend-setting. This helps investors to save time while receiving quality market data that helps them spot and seize emerging opportunities. Propichain’s AI-powered tools streamline investing via customizable search filters that enable users to identify high-ROI assets efficiently. As a Propichain (PCHAIN) user, you can also explore its automated trading features, closing deals via buy or sell orders that execute based on orders you set. With automated trading, you enjoy higher investing efficiency as you can close deals without a hands-on approach to participating in the housing market. Propichain simplifies investing with AI tools and enhances it with metaverse-powered virtual tours, allowing users to explore properties anywhere in the world. These virtual tours give a 3D view of your desired asset, giving you a clear picture of whether properties meet your taste or not. After exploring properties through immersive virtual tours, users can finalize deals effortlessly using Propichain’s secure smart contracts. These smart contracts can also be used to create specialized contracts for rental and leasing purposes. As a result, investors will enjoy higher efficiency in such housing deals. Finally, investors don’t have to worry about safety as Propichain’s smart contracts have been audited by BlockAudit, showing that its ecosystem has all it takes to keep users safe. Propichain’s Crypto AI Ecosystem Or Solana: Which Offers Better Returns? With these innovative tools revolutionizing housing investments, analysts are already comparing Propichain (PCHAIN) to industry leaders like Solana. Unlike Solana, which focuses on general blockchain scalability, Propichain specifically targets real estate investment barriers, offering tailored tools for property tokenization and immersive exploration. Propichain has also been listed on the prestigious CoinMarketCap, leading analysts to conclude that it could emerge as one of the top altcoin assets of 2025. These analysts also conclude that buying $1,000 worth of PCHAIN could be a great move that could grow to $100,000 by the end of the year. Propichain’s Ongoing Presale: Secure Your Spot Today Given its unique offerings, Propichain’s ongoing presale presents an attractive entry point for early investors to buy its PCHAIN token while the value is still very low. Many investors have rushed to buy PCHAIN before its expected market boom, leading to the sale of over $2 million in its ongoing presale. PCHAIN now sells at $0.011 after growing by 208.17% from its initial value of $0.004. Now in round two of its presale, PCHAIN is gearing up for a 108.93% rise that will take it to $0.023 by round three of its presale. PCHAIN will also grow to $0.032 by the end of its presale, meaning round one buyers will earn 800% ROI. With its groundbreaking approach to real estate investing, Propichain is not just reshaping the housing market—it’s opening doors to a more inclusive and efficient future. Join the revolution today by participating in its presale.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains a pillar, but altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and the emerging BigBossInu are proving to be the next big opportunities. These are the top cryptocurrencies set to rise before the broader rally gains full speed. BigBossInu is quickly emerging as a force in the crypto market, with its presale drawing significant interest from forward-thinking investors. Seen as a high-reward opportunity, those who get in early could see substantial returns. Backed by cutting-edge technology and a bold growth strategy, BigBossInu is setting the stage for impressive growth. BigBossInu is rewriting the rules for meme coins by pairing its appeal with practical utility. Launching at a presale price of $0.000084, it raised $100,000 in minutes, a testament to investor confidence.

Don’t miss out! >> Cardano (ADA): ADA recently hit a critical support at $0.88, showing a strong rebound from this level, indicating robust buying interest. If bulls can push it above $1.2, ADA could target $1.52 next. However, a failure to maintain above $0.88 may lead to further correction towards $0.50. Chainlink (LINK): LINK is currently trading above its 20-day EMA of $23.63 after a recent dip, with buying interest at lower levels. Bulls are targeting a breakout above $27.39 to retest resistance at $23.06. Bears may still be active at $21.39, which could lead to a drop if they defend that level well. Kaspa (KAS): Kaspa has been gaining traction for its unique proof-of-work mechanism aimed at solving scalability issues, making it a notable player in the blockchain space. Analysts are optimistic about its role in the next crypto bull run as interest in scalable blockchain solutions continues to grow. Arbitrum (ARB): ARB’s performance tends to align with broader market trends, especially in the context of layer-2 solutions aiming to enhance Ethereum’s scalability and efficiency. >> Conclusion As bullish sentiment returns to the crypto market, altcoins like BigBossInu, Cardano, Chainlink, Kaspa, and Arbitrum are attracting attention for their growth potential. BigBossInu’s presale is well-positioned for growth, but investors must proceed cautiously and conduct thorough research in this evolving market.

However, some experts argue that such a target is “too low” for BTC, considering its growing adoption and evolving market dynamics. $150,000 Target Too Low For Bitcoin Crypto trader Alex Becker recently took to X to share his thoughts on Bitcoin’s price momentum. The trader said that although the consensus points to BTC peaking at $150,000 this cycle, he believes that the target is “way too low and way too short.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Primed For A Major Rebound Following ‘Final Capitulation,’ Analyst Predicts Becker argued that at $150,000, Bitcoin’s market capitalization would only represent one-sixth of gold’s, leaving significant room for growth. He described the idea of BTC reaching merely one-sixth of gold’s market cap as “silly low.” At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s total market cap stands at $2.06 trillion. In comparison, gold commands a significantly larger market cap of approximately $18.5 trillion. As for why, the trader noted that unlike past market cycles, things are vastly different for BTC during the current cycle. The top cryptocurrency is poised to benefit from favourable regulations under Donald Trump’s administration, alongside increasing adoption by corporations and sovereign nations as a store of value. Becker projects that, driven by these factors, BTC could peak anywhere between $250,000 and $400,000. His outlook aligns with that of crypto analyst Will Clemente. In a recent post on X, Clemente noted that if a nation adopts Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset, it could trigger a domino effect, compelling other countries to follow suit. Clemente elaborated: Once a nation adopts BTC as a strategic reserve asset, it becomes inherently nationalist to DCA into said asset. Then apply this to every nation on Earth that wants to keep its purchasing power simultaneously in game theoretic fashion. BTC Supply Crunch Nearing? As more corporations add Bitcoin to their balance sheets and speculation grows about the potential establishment of a US strategic Bitcoin reserve, the active supply of BTC may come under pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Reserve Idea Sparks Cautious Response From Japan PM: Report Crypto analyst Miles Deutscher recently pointed out in an X post that Bitcoin balances on crypto exchanges have hit a fresh seven-year low. Historically, reduced exchange supply correlates with sharp, parabolic price increases for the asset. Other projections estimate BTC could reach a peak of around $200,000 by the summer of 2025. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $103,973, up 5.7% in the past 24 hours.

With the market buzzing and new projects emerging, it’s crucial to identify promising cryptocurrencies before they experience significant growth. One standout is Qubetics ($TICS) , a project addressing real-world issues that previous cryptocurrencies have struggled with. By focusing on practical applications and user-friendly solutions, Qubetics aims to bridge gaps in the current crypto landscape. In this article, we’ll explore Qubetics and two other altcoins that are gaining traction. These projects offer unique features and have the potential for substantial growth. By understanding their applications and recent developments, you can make informed decisions about which top coins to join this month . 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Pioneering Decentralized VPN Technology Qubetics is making waves in the crypto space with its innovative approach to internet privacy through its decentralized VPN (dVPN) application. Unlike traditional VPNs that rely on centralized servers, Qubetics’ dVPN leverages blockchain technology to create a peer-to-peer network. This ensures users enjoy secure, private, and unrestricted internet access without the vulnerabilities associated with central points of failure. Imagine you’re a freelance journalist working in a region with strict internet censorship. Using Qubetics’ dVPN, you can bypass these restrictions, accessing information freely and communicating securely with sources worldwide. For businesses, this means safeguarding sensitive data during remote operations, ensuring that proprietary information remains confidential. The excitement doesn’t stop there. The best crypto presale is currently in its 17th stage, with the $TICS token priced at $0.0501. The presale has already raised over $9.7 million, attracting more than 14,700 token holders and selling over 421 million $TICS tokens. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, translating into a 398.73% return on investment (ROI). Looking further ahead, projections suggest $TICS could hit $10 after the mainnet launch in Q2 2025, offering an astounding 19,849.33% ROI. To put this into perspective, if you invest $200 at the current price of $0.0501 per $TICS token, you would acquire approximately 3,992 tokens. If $TICS reaches $10 post-mainnet launch, your investment would be worth about $39,920—a significant return on your initial investment. Why this coin made it to this list: Qubetics stands out for its practical solution to internet privacy concerns and its impressive growth potential, making it one of the top coins to join this month. 2. Solana (SOL): Speed and Scalability Unmatched Solana has quickly emerged as one of the most popular blockchains, thanks to its unparalleled speed and scalability. With the ability to process thousands of transactions per second at minimal cost, Solana is attracting decentralized applications (dApps) and developers seeking efficiency. This high throughput is achieved through its unique consensus mechanism, which combines proof of history (PoH) and proof of stake (PoS). Recently, Solana’s ecosystem has expanded with the introduction of innovative projects and partnerships, further solidifying its position in the market. The network’s native token, SOL, has seen substantial growth, reflecting increased adoption and investor confidence. As of January 2025, SOL is trading at $219.13, with a market capitalization of $106.63 billion. Why this coin made it to this list: Solana’s technological advancements and growing ecosystem position it as a top coin to join this month for those looking to invest in high-performance blockchain platforms. 3. Chainlink (LINK): Bridging Smart Contracts with Real-World Data Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that enables smart contracts to securely interact with real-world data and external APIs. By providing reliable data feeds, Chainlink enhances the functionality of smart contracts across various blockchains, making it an essential component in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. In recent developments, Chainlink has expanded its services to support more blockchain networks, increasing its utility and adoption. The LINK token has experienced steady growth, reflecting its integral role in the blockchain ecosystem. As of January 2025, LINK is trading at $24.14, with a market capitalization of $12.5 billion. Why this coin made it to this list: Chainlink’s ability to connect smart contracts with real-world data makes it a crucial infrastructure project, earning its spot as a top coin to join this month. Conclusion As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, identifying projects with real-world applications and strong growth potential is key to making informed investment decisions. Qubetics, with its innovative decentralized VPN and impressive presale performance, offers a unique opportunity for investors seeking to join a promising project early. Solana’s unmatched speed and scalability make it a compelling choice for those interested in high-performance blockchains. Chainlink’s role in bridging smart contracts with real-world data solidifies its importance in the DeFi space. Don’t miss out on these top coins to join this month. By staying informed and acting promptly, you can position yourself to benefit from the growth and innovation these projects bring to the cryptocurrency landscape.

The attackers accessed 400 laptop and desktop computers at the department including Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s computer, reports Bloomberg, citing two people familiar with the matter. An early investigation has found employee usernames and passwords were accessed, along with at least 3,000 unclassified files. The department’s email and classified systems were not breached and on Yellen’s device, less than 50 files were reportedly accessed. The hackers appeared to be looking for information on sanctions and international affairs. They also accessed data on ongoing investigations at the Committee on Foreign Investment, which is an inter-agency body that reviews foreign investments in US businesses to identify potential national security risks. The Treasury Department reportedly discovered the breach after receiving a warning from BeyondTrust Corp. The access management firm notified the Treasury that its network had been exploited on December 8th.

Elon Bromance (ELOBRO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOBRO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Bromance by entering its contract address – FY7aYv7K3yEE9Z8hzgURj5z7biTE8Z6BpunBPAnCEpxj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOBRO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-18 02:33:00

Bitcoin (BTC) maintains its position, but altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH) and the promising BigBossInu are climbing the ranks. These digital assets are ready for a dramatic surge. BigBossInu Revolutionizes the Market with Its Game-Changing Presale BigBossInu is blazing a trail in the crypto market, with its groundbreaking presale gaining tremendous momentum among investors. It’s a high-reward opportunity for early movers seeking exponential gains. With an ambitious vision and trailblazing features, BigBossInu is primed to make a big impact. BigBossInu isn’t just another meme—it’s a transformative opportunity in the cryptocurrency world. Combining the excitement of meme culture with solid fundamentals, this project offers something that few others in the space do: high potential returns and a well-defined, deflationary tokenomics model. A growing, passionate community and strategic innovation make it a unique and powerful investment. Celebrate the success with BigBossInu: $100,000 raised in minutes! Enjoy a 50% EXTRA BONUS using code EXTRA50X—limited time offer! >> Uniswap (UNI) : UNI surged by 12% following the announcement of a new Ethereum layer-2 project called “Unichain,” focused on improving DeFi and liquidity across chains. This initiative aims to lower transaction costs by up to 95% compared to Ethereum layer-1, enhancing scalability and user experience. Ethereum (ETH) : Ethereum has been experiencing positive momentum, closely following the gains in the U.S. stock market indexes. Despite sideways consolidation, ETH is approaching the final phase of a bullish fractal pattern that could lead to a potential 40% price increase. Tron (TRX) : TRX saw a 9.5% monthly increase, outperforming Ethereum and Solana, despite a significant decline in total value locked (TVL) on the Tron network. Polkadot (DOT) : DOT continues to focus on improving interoperability and scalability, maintaining its position as one of the leading blockchain projects. Its progress is often linked to parachain developments and ecosystem growth. >> Conclusion Crypto investors are gearing up for a potential bull run, with altcoins like BigBossInu, Ethereum, XRP, Uniswap, Tron, and Polkadot set for growth. BigBossInu’s presale gains momentum, Ethereum hints at a breakout, and XRP benefits from legal wins.

If you regret missing out on these opportunities, there’s a new contender in the spotlight – Lightchain AI . This innovative project has already raised over $10.4 million in its presale at a price of $0.00525, positioning itself as the next big thing in the meme coin space—but with an added layer of utility and innovation. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe Coin Icons of the Meme Economy Dogecoin (DOGE), the first of funny coins, got notice for its group-based growth. What began as a jest has turned into a real money type, with support from well-known people and more use for paying and giving tips. Shiba Inu (SHIB) did the same, bringing its own style by adding use through group trade places (ShibaSwap) and holding methods. Its fast climb made many small b͏uys into lots of cash. Pepe Coin (PEPE), inspired by the famous meme, caused a stir in 2023 by giving quick rewards to first users, showing the market’s fondness for meme tokens. But these profits have led many buyers looking for the next big chance. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out as a Meme Coin Revolution Lightchain AI combines the viral appeal of meme coins with the transformative power of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI). Unlike traditional meme coins, it offers real-world utility and scalability, enabling developers to create intelligent decentralized applications (dApps) on its innovative platform. For investors, Lightchain AI’s presale presents a unique opportunity to capitalize on its potential. For example, an investment of $1,000 could acquire 190,476 LCAI tokens at $0.00525 each. With a projected target price of $1.50 by 2025, this investment could grow to an impressive $285,714. By blending community-driven energy with practical applications, Lightchain AI stands out in the crowded cryptocurrency market as a promising option for both developers and forward-thinking investors. The Future of Meme Coins with Lightchain AI Meme coins have demonstrated their ability to captivate the market’s attention, but Lightchain AI takes the concept further by combining utility with innovation. Envision a platform where creators and developers can seamlessly innovate and monetize their ideas. Lightchain AI’s Memecoin Launchpad makes this vision a reality. By leveraging AI-driven tools, it offers a secure and dynamic environment to foster the creative economy, unlocking new opportunities and driving a robust ecosystem. For those who missed out on Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, or Pepe Coin, Lightchain AI presents a chance to engage with a platform that merges the excitement of meme coins with the power of cutting-edge blockchain technology. With its presale ongoing , investors can secure their spot in what could be the next big thing in the crypto market. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to join the Lightchain AI community and be a part of the meme coin revolution.

Early investors have the chance to capitalize on a high-reward opportunity. Boasting cutting-edge technology and a powerful roadmap, BigBossInu is expected to deliver substantial returns in the months ahead.

However, there are mixed opinions about Solana’s attempt to expand into the hardware space with the new “Seeker” smartphone, designed specifically for the Web3 ecosystem. Chainlink (LINK): Chainlink has been showing bullish signs alongside other altcoins as Bitcoin consolidates. The recent announcement of Chainlink’s continued adoption in decentralized applications and its role in various ecosystem projects has boosted investor confidence. Injective (INJ): Injective has recently reached a record 370 million on-chain transactions, with its price surging over 70% in the past week, achieving an all-time high of $52.62. The rise is partly fueled by interest in AI integration with blockchain and anticipation of new token airdrops. Optimism (OP): Typically, OP’s price movement aligns with the broader adoption of layer-2 solutions to scale Ethereum and reduce transaction costs. Optimism remains a significant player in Ethereum’s scalability landscape. >> Conclusion As the crypto market gears up for a potential bull run, altcoins like BigBossInu, Ethereum, XRP, Uniswap, Tron, and Polkadot are positioned for growth.

LINK Whale Activity Climbs & TON Teams Up with Nansen",https://thecoinrise.com/investors-jump-to-web3bay-for-6430-roi-and-governance-rights-link-whale-activity-climbs-ton-teams-up-with-nansen/,"Recent activity from Chainlink whales has ignited optimism as major investors have started to gather more LINK, leading to considerable price increases and signaling a promising outlook for the asset. Likewise, the TON ecosystem has seen enhancements through the integration of Nansen’s analytics tools, providing valuable insights and bolstering its blockchain functionality for both developers and investors. At the same time, Web3Bay (3BAY) is revolutionizing the online shopping experience by incorporating Web3 into e-commerce. This platform diverges from conventional models by granting its community governance rights via the 3BAY token. With over $800K already raised in its ongoing presale, the token gives early holders the chance to influence important platform choices while setting them up for a potential 6,430% return on investment when it launches. Chainlink Whale Activity Prompts Positive Outlook for 2025 Recent activity by Chainlink whales has sparked significant momentum in the market, with LINK experiencing a nearly 5% increase on Tuesday and an overall 18% rise over three days. This upsurge correlates with substantial acquisitions, as large investors have accumulated over 1.40 million LINK tokens, showcasing their confidence in its growth potential. Additionally, this surge in Chainlink whale activity has affected on-chain metrics, indicating a decrease in exchange outflows which suggests a lowering of sell pressure and potential for further price increases. Analysts are now predicting that LINK might reach $40 soon, potentially nearing its all-time high of $52 set in February. This optimistic view highlights Chainlink’s critical role in major projects, suggesting a breakout year might be imminent. TON Ecosystem Enhances Capabilities with Nansen Analytics Partnership The TON ecosystem has advanced significantly through its recent partnership with Nansen, a top on-chain analytics provider. Developed by Telegram, the TON blockchain is designed for fast, scalable, and secure transactions, serving as a robust foundation for cutting-edge decentralized applications. This collaboration has introduced Query and Growth Dashboards, providing the TON ecosystem with sophisticated tools to monitor user activity, transaction volumes, and overall trends. Alex Svanevik, CEO of Nansen, has highlighted their dedication to delivering actionable insights that will support developers, investors, and the wider crypto community in driving innovation and discovering new opportunities within the TON ecosystem. Web3Bay Leads with a Community-Driven E-commerce Platform Web3Bay is at the forefront of integrating Web3 into e-commerce, transitioning control from centralized platforms to its user community. Leveraging blockchain technology, it provides a transparent and secure marketplace that allows users significant input in shaping the platform’s future. 3BAY token holders are pivotal in governance, having the ability to vote on important decisions such as the introduction of new features or adjustments to fee structures. This participatory approach ensures that the platform’s policies align with the needs of its most active users, fostering a culture of fairness and collaborative development. Moreover, Web3Bay extends beyond offering governance rights. Its blockchain infrastructure ensures both security and transparency, affording users full ownership of their data and assets. Sellers receive payments directly into their wallets, circumventing delays typical of intermediary involvement, and buyers maintain autonomy over their personal information. Further enhancing its decentralized ethos, Web3Bay plans to renounce ownership of its smart contracts post-presale, ensuring no single party can alter the platform’s operational framework—a genuine application of Web3 principles in e-commerce. Currently, during its fourth stage of presale, the 3BAY token is priced at $0.0039675 and has amassed over $800,000 in funding. Early investors are positioned to achieve substantial gains, with a potential 6,430% ROI at the projected launch price of $0.1959. Owning 3BAY tokens now means not only securing a say in the platform during its developmental phase but also influencing its trajectory before widespread adoption escalates demand. As the e-commerce sector evolves and decentralization emerges as a crucial advantage, the value of 3BAY tokens is set to increase, presenting a prime investment opportunity in the burgeoning market. Wrapping Up The continued surge in Chainlink whale activity is propelling LINK’s price higher, showcasing robust investor confidence and underscoring its crucial role in advancing blockchain technology. Simultaneously, the TON ecosystem is making significant strides with the aid of Nansen’s analytics, which equips users and developers with essential insights for navigating the blockchain space. Yet, the spotlight is on Web3Bay’s innovative decentralized marketplace, which is transforming the landscape of e-commerce by integrating Web3 capabilities. This shift enables user-driven ownership and governance. The platform’s native 3BAY token not only allows early holders to significantly influence its development but also sets the stage for potentially enormous returns, with a projected ROI of 6,430% at launch. With its central role and the momentum behind its growth, getting involved early in Web3Bay presents a compelling opportunity for those looking to capitalize on the expanding reach of decentralized markets .

Analysts are buzzing about BTFD Coin (BTFD) , a crypto sensation that has already raised $5.2 million in its presale. Whispers of a potential Binance debut are amplifying the hype, drawing comparisons to the explosive rises of Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) and Dogwifhat (WIF) after their own Binance listings. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, 90% staking rewards, and community-driven mission, BTFD Coin isn’t just riding the meme coin wave—it’s redefining it. Let’s unpack why BTFD Coin, WIF, and PENGU are dominating the conversation around the top new meme coins to invest in now. BTFD Coin: A Presale Powerhouse with Binance in Its Sights The phrase “Buy The Dip” has long been a mantra for savvy investors, and BTFD Coin brings that mindset to life. With a presale that’s already raised $5.2 million, this meme coin is turning heads. At $0.000142 per token in Stage 13, the presale is over 97% complete, meaning time is running out to secure your spot before the price jumps to $0.0006 upon listing. What’s Fueling the FOMO? BTFD’s presale performance is more than impressive—it’s a signal of things to come. With over 64 billion tokens sold and 8,500 Bulls already onboard, the community’s energy is palpable. Analysts are predicting a 4,000% surge, which could see the token’s price climb from its presale value to a projected $0.006. To put that into perspective, a $2,500 investment today would buy you approximately 17.6 million BTFD tokens. At the listing price of $0.0006, your investment would already be worth $10,563. But if the projected $0.006 materializes post-listing, you’d be sitting on a jaw-dropping $105,634. Play, Earn, and Stake BTFD Coin is more than just a meme. Its P2E game, launched on January 1, 2025, allows users to earn tokens while gaming, blending entertainment with income. Add in 90% APY staking rewards, and you’ve got a coin designed to reward long-term holders. Binance Debut Rumors Could BTFD follow in the footsteps of PENGU and WIF? The crypto community is buzzing with speculation that a Binance listing could be on the horizon. A Binance debut would catapult BTFD into the spotlight, offering liquidity, visibility, and, most importantly, the potential for massive gains. Dogwifhat (WIF): Riding the Binance Wave Dogwifhat made its Binance debut on September 7, 2024, and the impact was immediate. The token surged over 250% within 24 hours, jumping from $0.85 to $2.98. This meteoric rise made early adopters wealthy and cemented WIF as one of the top meme coins. Today, WIF is battling through a consolidation phase, but its Binance listing remains a defining moment. The exposure and liquidity provided by the listing continue to support its position in the meme coin market. With technical indicators like the Average Directional Index (ADX) showing strengthening trends, WIF could be poised for another breakout. Pudgy Penguins (PENGU): From Solana to Binance Success Pudgy Penguins’ PENGU token launched on Solana but skyrocketed after its Binance listing on December 21, 2024. Within 24 hours, PENGU’s price surged by over 300%, moving from $0.008 to $0.032. The listing drew in billions in trading volume, rewarding early investors with life-changing gains. Even months later, PENGU continues to capture attention, leveraging its NFT-driven community and viral campaigns. Plans for expansion to Ethereum and Abstract only add to the excitement, keeping PENGU on the radar of meme coin enthusiasts. Buy BTFD Coins Before the Presale Concludes! Connect Your Wallet: Go to the BTFD presale page and link your crypto wallet. Select Tokens: Choose the amount of BTFD you want to buy at the presale price.

Solana: The High-Performance Blockchain Powering Scalable Decentralized Applications Solana is a blockchain platform focused on scalability and performance. It provides a foundation for decentralized applications (dapps), competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano. Solana uses unique architectural choices to enable faster transactions and supports development across multiple programming languages. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of the Solana network. It is used for transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. The potential of Solana lies in its ability to handle high transaction volumes without relying on sharding or second-layer solutions. This makes it attractive for developers looking to build high-activity products and services. SOL underpins the ecosystem and allows users to access various projects on the platform. In the current market cycle, Solana and SOL may appear appealing due to their focus on scalability and performance, which are important factors in blockchain technology. Conclusion Though SOL and other coins have potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out by merging sports enthusiasm with meme culture, aiming for substantial growth through community-driven engagement.

This upward move represents a 4.9% daily gain and more than a 10% increase over the past week. Analysts have been examining this rally closely, noting that it mirrors patterns observed in past market cycles. Specifically, the role of market pullbacks—often seen as discouraging by short-term investors—has emerged as a critical factor behind Bitcoin’s long-term strength. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Upward Cycle Back? Key Insights Into The Latest Recovery Bitcoin Larger Rally Ahead, Here’s Why According to datascope, a contributor to CryptoQuant’s QuickTake platform, Bitcoin’s most significant rallies have frequently originated in so-called “bear zones.” These are periods when the market dips sharply, and sentiment turns pessimistic. However, the analyst emphasizes that these pullbacks are more than just periods of loss; they are times when patient investors can position themselves for future gains. The current recovery, as the analyst explains, aligns with a historical pattern where Bitcoin tends to emerge stronger after periods of sharp declines. Datascope wrote in a post on the CryptoQuant QuickTkake platform: When we look at Bitcoin’s pullbacks, a fascinating pattern emerges! What happens in those red-marked zones? The market takes a dive into the “bear zone,” and it feels like all hope is lost. But this is exactly where the magic begins!. By examining past performance, datascope found that Bitcoin’s strongest upward moves have historically followed these bearish periods. Rather than panic-selling, holding steady during these moments has proven advantageous for those looking to capitalize on the eventual market rebound. According to the analyst, “these patterns highlight the importance of market psychology and the power of patience.” Datascope concluded by noting: The takeaway is simple: if you can read Bitcoin’s ups and downs, pullbacks don’t have to be scary—they can be opportunities. While red zones might initially seem discouraging, history proves that the rebounds from these levels are often far more impressive. Patience wins! Coinbase Premium Index Signals Bullish U.S. Sentiment Meanwhile, another reason why Bitcoin’s ongoing recovery could lead to a larger rally is the fact that Coinbase Premium Index (CPI), has returned to positive territory for the first time since early January. This metric reflects the difference between Bitcoin’s prices on Coinbase and other exchanges, often seen as a gauge of US investor sentiment. The recent move into positive territory suggests that American buyers are reclaiming market influence, potentially driving Bitcoin’s recent gains. Related Reading: Crypto Fear And Greed Index Barrels Toward Extreme Greed Again As Bitcoin Price Clears $101,000, Is This Good News? Burak Kesmeci, another contributor to CryptoQuant, observed that US investors are showing renewed interest in Bitcoin as the inauguration of the new administration approaches. Kesmeci noted that the positive CPI readings indicate a market dominated by buyers on both daily and hourly timeframes. This shift in sentiment comes as Bitcoin reclaims the $100,000 milestone and may signal a broader trend of optimism among US investors.

Bitcoin (BTC) may rule the market, but altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and the emerging BigBossInu are shining with incredible profit potential. These picks are expected to take off as the market ignites. BigBossInu: Crypto Innovation at Its Finest, with a Hot Presale BigBossInu is making a splash in the cryptocurrency space with a presale that has investors excited. It’s a lucrative opportunity for early backers, with rewards expected to be substantial. Equipped with innovative features and a dynamic roadmap, BigBossInu is positioned for remarkable growth. BigBossInu is on a growth trajectory far exceeding the modest returns projected for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and even Cardano. In just minutes during its presale, BigBossInu raised $100,000, signaling massive interest and strong investor confidence. Its initial listing price of $0.007 already saw a 6,970% return for early buyers, with even greater potential ahead. BigBossInu : $100,000 raised in minutes—celebrate by using code EXTRA50X for an exclusive 50% EXTRA BONUS! >> Ethereum (ETH) continues to trade steadily around $3,463, with its ecosystem growing as decentralized finance (DeFi) and Layer-2 solutions gain traction. Analysts expect ETH to push higher as Ethereum ETFs start gaining traction and broader adoption of Ethereum’s DeFi infrastructure continues to expand​. Uniswap (UNI) saw a significant jump of 12% following the announcement of its new Layer-2 project called Unichain . This development aims to enhance DeFi scalability and lower transaction costs by 95%, making it a crucial move in improving liquidity across Ethereum’s ecosystem. Arbitrum (ARB) is facing a notable event with a token unlock scheduled for October 16, which will release approximately 92.65 million ARB tokens. This could impact ARB’s price and market dynamics as it represents 2.56% of its circulating supply, valued at around $49.4 million​. Sei (SEI) has hit a new all-time high of $1.59 recently, with its price currently hovering at $0.87. The Sei network is rapidly growing, particularly in the decentralized exchange (DEX) space, and the community is bullish about SEI potentially hitting $1 by early 2025 if the ecosystem continues its expansion​. >> Conclusion BigBossInu is making waves in the crypto space with a promising presale, offering substantial rewards for early backers. As Ethereum, Uniswap, and Arbitrum continue their growth, BigBossInu’s dynamic roadmap places it as a contender to surpass Cardano. Investors should consider the potential but be mindful of the inherent risks in this volatile market.

Here’s what we found. This article is written for educational purposes, and doesn’t encourage the use of the darkweb. Table of Contents What is the dark web? What is BreachForums? What we found on the dark web crime hub BreachForums Services found on BreachForums What do dark web criminals do with stolen user data? How to stay safe online What is the dark web? As a quick bit of background information, let’s clarify what we mean by the dark web and cybercrime forums. The dark web is a hidden part of the internet, accessible only through special browsing software like Tor, that focuses on user anonymity. The dark web serves as a hub for both legitimate uses, such as privacy-conscious browsing, and illegal activities, including the sale of stolen data, drugs, weapons, services, and other contraband. Cybercrime forums on the dark web are communities where hackers, fraudsters, and other criminals exchange information, tools, and services, often involving cryptocurrencies to facilitate anonymous transactions. You might also like: Hackers leak El Salvador’s Chivo Bitcoin wallet code What is BreachForums? BreachForums was launched as RaidForums in 2015 by Portuguese hacker Diogo Santos Coelho. RaidForums was started as a community focused on ‘raiding’ websites and online spaces as a form of pranking, trolling, or online disruption. However, as hackers on the site began breaching social media platforms and websites and stealing millions of user credentials, they started to sell these credentials to the highest bidder. RaidForums quickly evolved into one of the most sophisticated and well-established hubs of organized criminal activity on the dark web. Binance users KYC data seems to be on sale on the dark web now alleged github hack leak pic.twitter.com/SPjGQPsIlS — otteroooo (@otteroooo) February 4, 2024 When Binance was breached in February 2024 , BreachedForums was the first place that the user KYC details popped up for sale, and the same was true of the leaked Bitcoin ATM code used in the state of El Salvador, which appeared for sale on BreachForums in April of the same year. The site started to attract cybercriminals looking to buy sensitive information from corporate security breaches and even leaked government documents, causing it to be the focus of international law enforcement efforts. In 2022, Europol and U.S. intelligence agencies collaborated to seize the website and identify and arrest founder Diogo Santos Coelho who is now in UK custody awaiting extradition to the US for charges of cybercrime. FBI banner placed on BreachForums following 2022 seizure RaidForums was quickly re-established as BreachForums by a user called PomPomPurin who was arrested by the FBI in 2023, and the site was taken over by another user called Baphomet. BreachForums was seized by the FBI in May 2024, although cloned versions of the site have since popped up once more. While the site still boasts strong activity, as we’re about to show, many online users have speculated that the website may be a ‘honeypot’ or trap set up by the FBI to monitor cybercriminals and expose them for prosecution. What we found on the dark web crime hub BreachForums Entering BreachForums, we were immediately confronted with a barrage of proposed illegal activity. While some cybercrime forums adopt a more subtle approach of masquerading as communities of IT and cybersecurity enthusiasts, BreachForums has never made any such efforts to hide its true nature, and the home page at the time of our login showed users offering the violent services of the MS13 or La Mara Salvatruca gang for $10,000. Like all dark web postings involving violence, this is more likely to be a scam than a genuine offer, but the illegal activity didn’t stop there. The scrolling chatbox of the website also displayed users discussing, in real-time, the sale of The forum’s marketplace, which is buzzing with sellers offering illegal products such as stolen data , tutorials on bank fraud and credit card fraud, IP tracking, and much more. There was also, of course, a thread of Anime and Manga appreciation because even cybercriminals have hobbies. Anime thread | source: BreachForums All of the posts shown in this article were posted within hours of our initial login, demonstrating strong activity in an online community that is still very active, although one presumes under heavy observation from law enforcement. The above image shows users selling access to everything from online video streaming platforms like Paramount Plus and Netflix to breached OnlyFans accounts. Posts in the leaked data subforum showed users selling data leaks, including bundles of email logins for C-Suite directors of various companies as well as ID documents from the UAE, India, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia, as well as a leak of files and images stolen from Saudi Arabian military emails. This last leak featuring military documents appears genuine according to our preliminary investigation but was also shown to be from 2016, indicating that this user is attempting to pass off old leaked information as fresh, one of many examples of the types of scams that take place even among cybercriminals online. One user claimed to have exclusive access to an Australian health insurance MedBank leak, and Australia’s MedBank was indeed breached by Russian cybercriminals in 2022 when the personal information of 9.7m Australians was stolen. Database leaks subforum | source: BreachForums Unlike the hitman-for-hire type posts that the dark web is famous for, these document and identity leaks are sadly very plausible, as the main purpose of BreachForums is indeed to sell stolen data of this nature, and business has been booming for years. However, with the repeated seizures and arrests by law enforcement, it’s possible that some of these posts are also traps by the FBI or other agencies seeking to catch criminals in the act. Services found on BreachForums As well as stolen data, industrious cybercriminals also offer various services for hire on the dark web, invariably taking cryptocurrency as payment . On BreachForums, we immediately found users purporting to offer DDoS services, access to a distributed denial of service attack where criminals leverage a botnet to shut down a website’s operations to either extort money from the victim, target competing businesses or simply spite an enemy. Services subforum | source: BreachForums One online group of cybercriminal developers had an advertisement for HNVC or Hidden Virtual Network Computing services that can be used to gain remote access to a victim’s computer. It was interesting to note that much like an ad for legal online services, the post had a detailed list of features and pricing options available and offered customer support in both Russian and English. Services subforum | source: BreachForums Other services included services to provide phone numbers allowing criminals to receive login codes to activate online accounts without identifying themselves or their own phone number. We found bulk email senders used for illegal mass-marketing campaigns for products, phishing scams, or other malware, and also saw advertisements for email flooders used to clog up the email inbox of an enemy in an effort to make the email unusable or to hide malicious activities such as warnings of attempted logins. One email flooder went to the trouble of creating what appears to be an AI-generated banner ad and logo for their service, the name of which we have censored so as not to advertise their services. AI-generated ad for dark web email flooder | Source: BreachForums We saw entire threads dedicated to services selling access to remote online servers, programming services for web development, and even graphic design services, all of which could be used to create sophisticated scams such as fraudulent landing pages to steal victim’s user data. Of course, while some of these services may be legitimate, many of them are likely fake, and due to the website being seized and reopened multiple times, the accounts here are all under two years old. Cybercrime forums often operate on an escrow basis, or on the basis of trust where a user has a proven track record of ‘honest’ sales, whereas this new website has few measures in place to safeguard against scams. We did see several services advertising that they accept escrow payments, meaning a vetted third party holds funds until both parties are satisfied with payment, as with this developer offering pre-made phishing websites and landing pages. Services subforum | source: BreachForums The willingness to accept escrow indicates that this user may indeed be selling what they claim to sell, although there are likely many scams involving escrow payments on this site as well. In fact, the site has an entire scam thread on the site that shows a log of users reporting on-site scams. User uuu732 reports that their efforts to scam others online backfired due to falling prey to a scam on BreachForums themselves. They paid user PennyTrate-x $300 for software that would allow them to bypass malware detection softwares and send malware-infected PDFs to their unsuspecting victims. Scam Reports subforum | source:crypto.news The seller did not provide the goods, and when the moderator asked them for an explanation, they declined to respond, leading to their account getting banned. Another user reported a dispute with a different seller. In this case, the user spent $500 attempting to purchase database of user credentials breached from a Swiss insurance company and an additional $1,300 trying to purchase the database of a Swiss retail outlet. They reported that they did not receive their illicit data in either transaction. What do dark web criminals do with stolen user data? Cybercriminals buy login data and user data in an effort to hack email and social media accounts to either gain access to a user’s finances and rob them, or to gain access to sensitive information that they can further exploit. For example, a dark net criminal might access a user’s PayPal account and try to make unauthorized purchases or transfer funds directly to another account, or commit identity theft by applying for loans in someone else’s name using their passport information. This information is also commonly used for extortion and blackmail purposes when criminals find sensitive information by logging into their victim’s accounts. How to stay safe online As we can see, the dark web is a dangerous subsection of the internet for many reasons. Even on this website that has been seized and reopened multiple times, we find an open-air bazaar of criminal activity ranging from illegal services and products to scams being perpetrated against other members of the forum. On the clearnet, users can stay safe by implementing two-factor authentication on their devices and online accounts, meaning a second device like their phone is needed to sign in to an account. This can help prevent hacking and phishing attacks. Likewise, taking care to verify URLs online to ensure that they’re correct and not mispelled or fraudulent can help prevent falling prey to an attack. Unsuspecting users visiting the dark web, even purely out of personal interest, will find themselves rubbing shoulders with seasoned scammers and hackers probing for any weakness they can find. Users visiting the dark web should avoid clicking on any unfamiliar links or downloading any files, and while it should go without saying, making a purchase of any kind can open you up to all kinds of trouble from both legal and non-legal actors. In fact, the best way to stay safe from the dark web is simply not to visit it in the first place! Let us do that for you. We aim to visit other corners of the dark web on a regular basis and give regular updates on our findings, keeping you up to date on the underbelly of the global internet. You might also like: FBI traces crypto transfers to dismantle $100m dark web marketplace How to get to the dark web on a Chromebook? People ask this all the time, and the answer is a little complicated. Firstly, we don’t recommend that anyone accesses the dark web! While the space is interesting to explore from a journalistic point of view, it’s also full of scammers and other types of criminals that can be dangerous to come across. To get to the dark web on a Chromebook, people typically install Linux via the Crostini app and simply add the Tor browser repository to gain access to Tor’s hidden serices, AKA the dark web. However, once again, this is not recommended unless done for research or journalism purposes. Why is the dark web so creepy? The dark web has a reputation for being ‘creepy’ partly due to the prevalence of popular YouTube videos which showed YouTubers claiming to open ‘mystery boxes’ from the dark web, as well as the popularity of short stories and ‘creepypastas’ which featured the dark web in horror fiction. In reality, these videos are typically staged, and the dark web is often more businesslike. People usually access it either to share information without being censored or persecuted, such as political whistleblowers, or, of course, to perpetrate cybercrime and deal in contraband. How to check my if my email is on dark web? While breached email addresses are sold on websites like Nulled, you don’t need to access the dark web to see if your email is there. To check if your email is on the dark web, you can use the Have I Been PWNed tool on the clear net instead. Is the dark web real ? Yes, the dark web is very real! Large sums of money are exchanged in the sale of narcotics, breached online accounts, malware, weapons, hacking services for hire, and other forms of contraband. What to do if email is on dark web ? If your email is found to be on the dark web, you should change your password immediately and setting up two-factor authentication (2FA). If you’re finding that people are still trying to access your account, such as with emails in your inbox asking you to confirm logins, you might want to consider changing your email address altogether.",Feature|Exclusive|Crime|darknet,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|BNB,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-18 03:46:00

While projects like Ethereum and Solana could reap the benefits of this bull run, analysts are highlighting Rollblock as a highly lucrative alternative. Rollblock Attracts Investors with Major Presale Win Rollblock is a GambleFi project aiming to revolutionize the $450 billion traditional gambling market through blockchain technology. The Web3 casino features over 7,000 games, live dealers, and sports betting, all operating on-chain. This ensures every outcome is registered and encrypted on Ethereum, eliminating the risk of fraud. The focus on transparency and safety has paid off for Rollblock. In December alone, the protocol recorded $1.75 million in wagers alongside a 600% surge in signups and deposits. Analysts predict these figures could double by the end of January. Rollblock’s success doesn’t stop there. The protocol raised over $8.7 million from more than 40,000 participants during its presale. RBLK, Rollblock’s native token, has already delivered a 330% return for early investors. Currently priced at $0.046, experts believe RBLK could hit $1 by the end of 2025, outperforming Ethereum and Solana by a wide margin. This hype is further fueled by Rollblock’s revenue-sharing model. The GambleFi protocol allocates up to 30% of its revenue to support RBLK’s price growth. Of these tokens, 40% are used to provide some of the highest APYs on the market for RBLK stakers, while the remaining 60% are immediately burned. The entire ecosystem operates under an e-gaming license issued by the Anjouan Authority. Additionally, Rollblock’s smart contracts have successfully passed a SolidProof audit showcasing its dedication to transparency. Traders Eye a Break Above $5k for Ethereum Ethereum is trading at $3,350 as it consolidates following a recent pullback. Growing investor interest and technical indicators suggest the potential for upward momentum. A breakout above the $3,480 resistance could trigger a rally toward $3,800–$3,900, with $4,000 as a critical psychological target for Ethereum. The Relative Strength Index is currently at 27, indicating oversold conditions that often precede price rebounds. Whale activity has also increased, supporting the case for a bullish move. Institutional interest remains a strong driver for Ethereum. December 2024 saw over $2 billion in ETF inflows, with BlackRock’s ETHA fund alone contributing $1.4 billion, highlighting Ethereum’s growing appeal among long-term investors. Can Solana Reach $500 This Cycle? Solana is trading at $217, up 3.01% in the past 24 hours as optimism builds around its long-term potential. With its momentum snowballing, experts believe that Solana could reach $500 by 2025. Key factors supporting this outlook include the anticipated approval of Solana-based ETFs, which could bring billions in investments and position it as a major player in blockchain adoption. FDUSD’s recent launch has also strengthened Solana’s financial infrastructure. On-chain data reveals growing whale activity, with large transaction volumes signaling confidence in Solana’s long-term potential. RSI and trading volumes suggest room for further upside, while breakout patterns on TradingView align with the bullish sentiment. Is $1 a Real Target for Rollblock? Rollblock is currently one of the most successful GambleFi projects on the market. Its momentum is now snowballing, with thousands of investors joining the project each week. Should this trend continue, Rollblock could reach $1 before the end of 2025. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Trump Buys Solana (TRUMPSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 8Ruz6rzYPpKHActX3jo49v8WBhiJ5KsGM6dyCghQj3i – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

While Rollblock continues to turn heads, Fantom is doing a complete rebrand, and SUI looks set to soar again, with signs pointing toward another breakout. These developments are setting the stage for big changes in the crypto world, and Rollblock is at the heart of it all. As Rollblock builds momentum, its presale is attracting more attention, with the price rising steadily. Currently, at $0.046 per token, Rollblock’s presale has already raised over $8.7 million, and experts are predicting massive gains as the presale nears its end. This could be one of the best opportunities for investors from other blockchains, including SUI and Fantom. Rollblock is Setting the Stage for Big Jumps in the Latest Crypto News Rollblock is making waves in the GambleFi world, transforming the online gambling scene with its blockchain-powered crypto casino. By using blockchain technology, Rollblock enhances transparency and security, solving long-standing issues of fraud and trust in the $450 billion iGaming market. This cutting-edge platform іs not only attracting thousands оf active users, but it’s also becoming a go-to choice for gaming and sports betting enthusiasts alike. With an excellent entry price and having raised over $8.7 million during its presale , Rollblock has already seen a 300% price increase since its launch. With such a strong foundation, Rollblock is setting the stage for major gains, and its next milestone could very well see it hitting an all-time high (ATH) as it continues to soar. Fantom Rebrands: Is This a Good Move? Fantom (FTM) has recently caught the market’s attention in the latest crypto news. Coinbase’s decision tо stop trading Fantom (FTM-PERP) starting January 24, combined with regulatory scrutiny and bearish market sentiment, has left the project іn a tough spot. With Coinbase delisting looming, Fantom’s visibility and accessibility are at risk. Despite these challenges, Fantom’s rebranding to Sonic is being viewed as a potential lifeline. The launch of the Sonic Foundation and the airdrop of 190 million S tokens are steps toward restoring liquidity and increasing market confidence. Moreover, technological upgrades like the Sonic upgrade could make the platform more attractive to developers and users alike. Is SUI Ready for Another Jump? SUI made an impressive move during the last bull cycle, jumping from $1.85 to $5.20 – new ATH – in no time. This surge caught the attention of many investors and solidified its position as one of the most promising altcoins in the market. Despite facing challenges, SUI showed incredible resilience, proving its strength in volatile times. Now, SUI is trading at $4.60, holding strong despite the tough crypto conditions in December 2024. The broader market may have been struggling, but SUI has weathered the storm well. With its ability to resist the bearish pressure, it seems like SUI could be gearing up for another big jump. Conclusion With Rollblock continuing to show remarkable growth and innovation, its potential for massive gains remains undeniable. Aside from that, SUI and Fantom also have their things, which is creating a lot of fuss as well.

Bitcoin reclaimed the $101K mark, and several altcoins toe the same line. But the best are always different from the rest! XRP, XLM, RBLK, and BGB are leading the pack as the best crypto projects, drawing massive attention from investors and traders. Ripple’s landmark breakthrough spurred positive sentiment, while hot new crypto casino Rollblock is headlining with its ongoing presale. Rollblock: The hot new crypto casino edges close to $9M raise in presale One of the best crypto projects raising the dust as a top investment for this year is the new cutting-edge Rollblock GambleFi platform. This hot new crypto casino has emerged as an innovative replacement for traditional casinos’ shortfalls. Rollblock is upgrading the Vegas thrill with blockchain technology and AI. Its focus on providing a more transparent, provably fair gaming experience has attracted investors’ attention. Beyond this, its deflationary and income-generating tokenomics offer a unique advantage. Holders can earn passively from staking rewards and revenue-sharing programs. These utility-driven values have created a massive demand for this hot new crypto’s presale , selling at just $0.046. Ripple XRP: Innovative global payment solution seeking bullish sentiment Ripple’s Grass to Grace tale is an absolute inspiration and testament to its innovative focus. As one of the most groundbreaking additions to global payment, Ripple has changed cross-border payments. Thus, analysts assessing it as one of the best crypto projects is no surprise. Weeks after recording an SEC win and launching RLUSD, Ripple climbed to $3.35, just cents shy of its 2018 ATH. Rumors suggesting Donald Trump might back an America First crypto stockpile, including XRP, Solana, and USDC, ignited bullish sentiment, adding a 32% MoM gain to XRP. Stellar: XLM follows in XRP’s trail. Flips SUI with a 24% gain Stellar Lumens is another cross-border remittance solution that’s getting bullish sentiment off XRP’s win. The excitement rippled through XLM, and it surged a whopping 17% MoM, pushed its value close to $0.5, and flipped SUI. The broader market uptrend helped XLM break free of bear pressure. XLM’s ecosystem development also contributed significantly. Token burns and ecosystem growth drove demand. Beyond the price action, XLM’s ecosystem is booming, and experts suggest it could hit $1 soon. Bitget token soars amid ecosystem development. How far can BGB go this month? Bitget’s BGB token has also been at the center of attention. The native and utility token of the leading Bitget centralized exchange had an impressive 2024, surging an astonishing 813% and outpacing seasoned assets. The exchange is expanding with newer innovations, so the outlook is no different this year. BGB’s expansion of its service to El Salvador positions BGB as a powerhouse token. Additionally, the exchange recently burned 800 million BGB tokens, slashing supply by 40% in a move that could drive long-term value. Conclusion: What is the best crypto project to invest in? The recent rally has spotlighted the best crypto projects that could print life-changing gains in 2025. Experts have identified XRP, XLM, RBLK, and BGB as the standouts. However, Rollblock is emerging as the top, high-potential, but undervalued gem that could outperform them all. Its iGaming solution has raked in a whopping $8.8M in months, and it’s becoming analysts’ favorite. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

The letter raised questions about the motivations behind his donation to the incoming president’s inaugural fund. The latest episode pitting Sam Altman against Elizabeth Warren is part of a developing pattern of clashes between lawmakers and the biggest stakeholders in the tech industry. These tensions often come due to increasing concerns about the growing influence of tech leaders on the general populace and the government policies that help their causes. Companies like Sam Altman’s OpenAI, Meta, Apple, Google, and Microsoft have controlling stakes in their respective industries. With this level of control, questions about transparency, accountability, competitive integrity, and the potential for bias are bound to arise. Those queries have only grown with the nature of their relationship with the incoming Trump administration. Sam Altman responds to Democrat scrutiny OpenAI CEO Sam Altman publicly shared and responded to a letter from Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bennet, where they both questioned his personal $1M contribution to President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration fund. The senators expressed concerns that such a substantial donation from a tech leader may come off as an attempt to influence the incoming administration’s policies and potentially circumvent regulatory scrutiny. Sam Altman posted photos of the letter on his X account, adding the caption: “Funny, they never sent me one of these for contributing to democrats.” In a follow-up post, the CEO stated that, as the letter mentioned, the donation was a personal contribution and not on behalf of OpenAI. funny, they never sent me one of these for contributing to democrats… pic.twitter.com/xjpanXSb5D — Sam Altman (@sama) January 17, 2025 Altman’s mention of previous donations to previous Democratic campaigns without similar scrutiny has an undertone of double standard accusations, a criticism that Elizabeth Warren often faces. While the crypto industry is still trying to understand the full extent of “ Operation Chokepoint 2.0 ,” Senator Warren’s involvement as the driving force of the attempt to limit access to banking facilities for US-based crypto is no longer in question. On the other hand, the senators’ questions are not unfounded. OpenAI has legal troubles and is under investigation by several federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The case that started after its decision to convert into a for-profit status is still in court, led by Elon Musk and backed by Mark Zuckerberg. The letter goes on to mention other big tech companies that have made substantial contributions to the president elect’s camp, citing the legal challenges they face and why cozying up to Trump is in their best interest. These companies include Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Warring against big tech The letter to Sam Altman is not Senator Warren’s first bout with tech and political stakeholders. She has been a vocal advocate for increased transparency and accountability within the technology industry. In March 2024, Senators Warren and Bernie Sanders criticized Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg for the company’s poor management of content moderation and the suppression of relevant information concerning Palestinian-related matters. She has also pointed out that the recent pattern of tech leaders engaging with political figures leads to questions about conflicts of interest. Warren previously urged President-elect Trump to establish conflict-of-interest rules for tech figures like Elon Musk, who, after significant contributions to Trump’s campaign, was appointed to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Such relationships raise concerns about the potential for tech leaders to wield undue influence over government policies to benefit their business interests.

January had one more surprise brewing, as profit takers caused a huge bearish spiral in the second week. Now, the market is back in recovery, but these three tokens are well positioned to make new all-time highs in the new year. BNB, Tron, and the new Rollblock token are all set for quite the jump. Rollblock’s presale is on at the moment; the new crypto coins are in their 9th presale stage and selling out fast. Here’s why. Trump’s inauguration sparks new drive on BNB The BNB price has set a new target on its new bullish trend, as news from White House has affected the token price. BNB has always been good to its token holders, and the BNB is eyeing a new ATH at the moment. Donald Trump’s inauguration is only days away, and the entire crypto-verse has been whipped into a frenzy already. The BNB token, especially, has seen more buyers on the platform, a phenomenon that will only increase demand for BNB in the long run. Already, the BNB price is exchanging for about $725, with a 4.22% spike in the past week. The current rebound saw the token surge from $661.75; little wonder traders have set a mental target at $750. Tron makes stablecoin headlines The stablecoin sector has seen a lot of players join Tether, Circle, and Maker in the past few months. Now, Tron has announced plans to launch its USDD 2.0, a new stablecoin yield protocol that’s offering 20% APY to its investors. With passive profits that could get to 20%, and a plan for transparency, Tron CEO Justin Sun is looking to take over stablecoin trading in the crypto market. And the news is already driving the Tron price upward. Tron has bounced from a $0.2184 bottom on Monday to close the week at $0.2459. There’s only a 1.5% spike in that time, but the major recovery started when Sun made the announcement on Wednesday. The BNB and Tron prices are certainly bullish, but they are well past their periods of massive spikes. If you want double-figure gains, here’s some Rollblock for you.

We all love to get a feel of what others think. This article is here to help you out. Here, we’d be covering 2025 crypto price predictions for tokens like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Sui (SUI) and one hidden gem for the year. Ready? Blink and you might just miss it. Let’s get right into it. Ethereum (ETH) Outlook for 2025 Ethereum is no newcomer to crypto traders and it’s one of the safe bets for 2025. However, with the market moving sideways, there’s been mixed signals from the #2 kingpin. However, ETH’s reserves have been at a two month low, which means people are not letting go of their precious Ethereum. At the same time, the estimated leverage ratio jumped 20 percent, meaning traders feel confident enough to borrow more for bigger bets. This mix of reduced selling pressure and more leverage hints that many expect Ethereum to climb. However, transaction fees average around $2.70, which can turn users away if they want cheaper chains. Also, some worry about layer-2 solutions not being fully secure. Still, if Ethereum manages to lower fees and ease network congestion, it could break key resistance near $3,300. Analysts say Ethereum must stay above $3,186 for a shot at $3,600 or higher. If it holds that level and solves fee issues, ETH could possibly reach $3,700 to $3,800 by the end of 2025. If the network fails to address these problems, though, ETH might stay below the $3,500 mark. Solana (SOL) Riding The ETF Hype Solana is trading around $209, up about 11 percent in the past week. A recent report from a major bank predicts that if altcoin ETFs for Solana and others launch soon, SOL might pull in 3 to $6 billion of fresh capital. That influx could push SOL to new highs, especially if Donald Trump’s administration rolls out more crypto friendly policies. Right now, ETF approval is just a possibility but the history of spot Bitcoin ETFs shows how they can inject billions into a token. If these Solana ETFs follow a similar path, SOL might surpass its previous record highs by 2025. On the other hand, if regulators stay strict and the ETFs don’t happen, some analysts believe Solana could hover between $250 and $300. The key is whether the hype leads to real inflows that boost long term liquidity. Sui (SUI) and Its Next-Gen Gaming Ecosystem Sui is trading near $4.71 with a 2 percent rise this month. What makes Sui unique is its recent focus on Web3 gaming and deeper on chain features. A recent collaboration with SEED aims to build a large-scale gaming ecosystem that can handle millions of users. The Sui Foundation supports this plan to merge fun gameplay with true blockchain integration. They want to overcome problems like tricky onboarding steps and short lived games by making them simpler and more connected to on-chain assets. If Sui’s ecosystem breaks through these barriers and onboards major game developers, SUI could see a significant price leap by 2025. Some analysts hint that if the Sui-SEED project takes off, SUI might rise from the current $4.72 to around $6 or $7. However, if onboarding remains too complicated, SUI may stay under $5 for an extended time. The Hidden Gem: Remittix (RTX) While not a mainstream token like ETH, SOL or SUI, Remittix is gaining attention among those looking for real world utility. Its presale token price recently moved from $0.0199 to $0.0207, indicating robust demand. Thanks to its PayFi model, analysts believe Remittix could reach $1 if mass adoption kicks in. This approach merges cryptocurrency with traditional banking systems, allowing faster cross border payments. Many people see that as a crucial use case the crypto market needs. By simplifying how funds move across borders, Remittix (RTX) hopes to solve pain points bigger tokens haven’t addressed. If adoption grows in 2025, some believe RTX could become one of the year’s standout performers. However, failure to attract enough mainstream partners might keep it under the radar. Regardless, it could be worth watching if you think utility wins out over speculation in the next market cycle. A Bet on Remittix and Utility Ethereum, Solana and Sui each show promise for 2025 but face big challenges. Ethereum must fix high fees and prove its layer-2 solutions are secure. Solana rides heavily on ETF hopes, which could bring billions in capital or none at all if regulators stay strict. Sui aims to revamp Web3 gaming, yet needs top developers and millions of users for real success. Remittix, on the other hand, offers a clear use case by targeting cross border payments. This utility driven focus may give it staying power when market hype fades. If you believe the future belongs to projects with practical benefits, RTX might be your best bet among the 2025 crypto price predictions.

The overall expectation remains bullish, as a possible five-wave Elliott Wave pattern suggests higher prices ahead. After completing a fourth wave triangle, XRP has been consolidating, and there are still opportunities for further gains. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.21, down by more than two percent in the last 24 hours. Key Resistance and Support Levels XRP is currently facing resistance at the $3.30 level. The price has been consolidating just below this key point, building strength for a potential breakout. A slight 7% pullback has occurred, but in the volatile world of crypto, this isn’t significant, especially considering a prior 45% rise. Support levels remain important to monitor, especially between $2.52 and $2.94. This range could serve as a base for any pullback, potentially setting the stage for a move higher. Market Structure and Potential for Pullback While the possibility of a pullback is still on the table, there’s no clear evidence of a major top forming. A triangle pattern may still evolve, and the market could continue forming higher highs. However, any pullback, if it occurs, should be relatively shallow. The main invalidation point for the current bullish outlook is at the $2.32-$2.33 level. As long as XRP holds above this mark, the trend remains upward. Next Upside Targets for XRP Looking ahead, the next major upside targets for XRP are at the $4.20 and $5 levels. If these are broken, the price could head toward the $6.61 region. These levels are part of a broader long-term bullish outlook for XRP.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-18 04:25:05

Cardano (ADA) has managed to stay strong with a 15% surge during the last week. The ADA team is fresh off its Hydra scaling upgrade and is solidifying its position in the DeFi space. Meanwhile, Investors are convinced that Remittix , which seeks to blend crypto and fiat, is poised for high returns. Here’s why experts think RTX will finish ahead of ADA in 2025. Cardano’s (ADA) Path to Community Governance Following a 4% decline in the past month, Cardano (ADA) has increased in value by 18% in the last 7 days and is currently trading at $1.07. Cardano is seeing a significant increase in investor attention after Whales purchased over 100 million ADA tokens in the last 48 hours. According to experts, this move could drive up the price of ADA in January. Additionally, the approaching Plomin hard fork is a main force behind Cardano’s progress. With plans to change Cardano’s system of governance, the update will provide ADA holders with direct voting rights on important network decisions. This step strengthens the decentralization of the network by removing the requirement of a central governance. First presented via the Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP-1694), the Plomin hard fork has already attracted significant community interest. With 209 out of 213 votes in support, Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) have committedly supported the idea, with the community anticipating a final decision soon. Moreover, the hard fork marks the end of a significant stage in Cardano’s development. In spite of the governance issue, the network has continued to grow and develop its ecosystem with more total value locked (TVL). All of these reflect the rising demand for Cardano’s use and services. Remittix (RTX): Transforming Fintech with Seamless Solutions Remittix (RTX) stands apart in the Fintech market by tackling challenging issues such as excessive transaction fees and payment delays. By facilitating smooth crypto-to-fiat cross border transfers, it offers itself as a solution for under-banked communities, removing impediments like crypto-to-fiat conversions and slow, expensive banking infrastructure. The platform enables users to exchange over 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and transfer payments straight to bank accounts worldwide. Recipients get payments in their chosen currencies, boosting flexibility. Additionally, its Pay API allows companies to accept cryptocurrency payments, offering a simplified alternative for crypto-to-fiat transfers. Likewise, Businesses benefit from merchant accounts that support over 50 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies, enabling flexibility in managing cash flow. Compared to more established platforms like Stripe, Wise and Coinbase, Remittix provides more flexibility. It supports over 30 fiat currencies and over 50 cryptocurrency pairings, has no hidden fees and ensures lightning fast transactions that take minutes instead of days. Investors are particularly enticed by its staking benefits, with up to 8% APY for regular holders and 18% APY for VIP members with platinum debit cards and voting privileges. The current RTX token presale has witnessed considerable interest, with tokens at $0.0207 and over $3 million raised in the presale. Analysts predict an 800% spike upon launch and 5,000% percent afterward, solidifying Remittix as a leading competitor in the crypto market for 2025.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains a leader, but altcoins like Ethereum (ETH) and the promising BigBossInu are gaining traction. These digital currencies are set to surge as the market enters full bullish momentum. BigBossInu Disrupts Crypto with a Red-Hot Presale BigBossInu’s presale is generating excitement in the crypto market, with investors rushing to grab a share of this high-reward opportunity. The project’s innovative features and future-focused roadmap make it one to watch. With momentum building, BigBossInu is expected to deliver impressive growth. BigBossInu’s growth is driven by a passionate group of supporters who actively engage with the project and contribute to its success.

Analysts are optimistic that if ETH can maintain momentum and break key resistance levels at $3,103, it may rise towards $4,000 in the coming weeks, with potential longer-term targets of $5,000​. XRP is anticipated to surge by up to 30% in October, potentially reaching $2.17, according to analysts. This comes amidst growing optimism in the broader market and Ripple’s continued legal progress with the SEC. Injective (INJ) has broken through its April 2021 high of $20.47, signaling strong bullish momentum. However, its rapid rise has put the asset in overbought territory, which may lead to a short-term correction. INJ’s long-term outlook remains positive, driven by its expanding presence in decentralized finance (DeFi)​. Sei (SEI) continues its upward trend, currently priced around $0.416, with strong growth in its decentralized exchange (DEX) infrastructure. SEI has shown a significant increase of over 23% in the past week, and analysts expect it to remain bullish, with potential gains through the rest of 2024. >> Conclusion As the crypto market gains momentum, undervalued cryptos like Ethereum, Cardano, and BigBossInu are positioned for substantial growth. However, BigBossInu’s presale is sparking investor excitement. This asset, with innovative features and strategic roadmaps, offer attractive opportunities for significant returns.

Big names in crypto, such as Michael Saylor, Brian Armstrong, the Winklevoss brothers and Jesse Powell, and future officials in the incoming administration, most notably Trump's crypto czar pick, David Sacks mixed in the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium. As they drank cocktails and downed truffle tuna tartare, they took in a performance from rapper Snoop Dogg and — maybe more significant for their Washington prospects — a visit from Speaker of the House Mike Johnson . The event marks the dramatic upswing in Washington fortunes for the crypto industry. With red ""Make Bitcoin Great Again"" hats circulated at the event , the attendees count on a close relationship with the new administration and the new session of Congress that could finally cement policy to establish digital assets as a full-fledged part of the regulated U.S. financial sector. U.S. tech firms — with crypto companies included — have used inauguration contributions as another means of showing financial support for the new administration after Trump had already benefited from a number of big-dollar campaign supporters. Crypto businesses, including Coinbase, Ripple, Kraken and Circle, have made major contributions to Trump's inaugural committee, helping bring its total to record levels. Some of the same companies are on the Crypto Ball's sponsor list. The four-hour affair, which was advertised at various advertised prices of $2,500 and $5,000 for the tickets, was billed by a spokesperson as an ""exclusive social event,"" and the outside press was barred from joining the crowd of CEOs and founders. Nestled among the neoclassical buildings that house the Environmental Protection Agency headquarters, the government auditorium is the same historic space that saw the signatures that gave birth to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and also President Bill Clinton's signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (both of which are roundly criticized by the incoming president). On Sunday, the venue will also house the inauguration-eve party hosted by conservative news purveyor Newsmax. By Monday, Trump will be sworn in as president. That ceremony, moved indoors because of forecasts of temperatures even more frigid than the day Barack Obama first took the same oath, is expected by Trump's crypto supporters to be quickly followed by a rain of executive orders and appointments that they're betting will put the industry on firmer footing with the U.S. government.

In a post shared on X, Amelie stated, “When XRP hits $19, it flips BTC. When XRP hits $4, it flips ETH.” While her post reflects the community’s optimism that XRP can secure the top spot in the crypto market, her calculations utilizing the asset’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) complicate her prediction. WOW! WHEN #XRP HITS $19, IT FLIPS BTC. WHEN XRP HITS $4 IT FLIPS ETH. THE TRUE KING IS COMING FOR THE CROWN! pic.twitter.com/aio02E9qOL — 𝓐𝓶𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓮 (@_Crypto_Barbie) January 15, 2025 Understanding the Metrics To evaluate Amelie’s assertion, it is important to distinguish between FDV and circulating market capitalization. FDV considers the total supply of a cryptocurrency—in XRP’s case, approximately 100 billion tokens. However, circulating market capitalization uses the current circulating supply, which for XRP stands at 57.49 billion tokens. Currently, XRP trades at $3.23 with a market capitalization of $186.17 billion, based on its circulating supply, and this is the industry standard for ranking tokens. The FDV for XRP, using the total token supply, is $323.41 billion. Circulating Supply-Based Analysis At the time of Amelie’s analysis, Bitcoin had a market cap of $1.89 trillion, while Ethereum’s was at $383.94 billion. XRP must surpass Ethereum’s market capitalization using its circulating supply to flip Ethereum. Dividing Ethereum’s current market cap by XRP’s circulating supply yields a breakeven price of approximately $6.678. Notably, a prominent analyst recently spotted a pattern on XRP’s chart that could send its market cap to $502 billion , surpassing ETH by a wide margin. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 For XRP to flip Bitcoin, its market cap must exceed Bitcoin’s $1.89 trillion. Using XRP’s circulating supply, this equates to a price of approximately $32.96 per XRP. Again, this is far beyond the $19 price suggested in the post. Can XRP Take the Top Spot? XRP has a long journey ahead, as $32.96 is 940% higher than its current price. Many in the crypto community have speculated that XRP could flip Ethereum. Ben “Bitboy” Armstrong, a strong proponent of XRP, has been a vocal advocate of XRP’s potential to flip Ethereum. Many in the community have also drawn attention to the period in 2014 when XRP was the second-largest cryptocurrency. However, some are more ambitious. Dark Defender, a prominent crypto analyst, has weighed in on this, affirming that XRP can surpass Bitcoin , and take the crown as Amelie stated in her post.

While both projects are expected to see strong returns, they now face strong competition from Rollblock . This innovative project has emerged to be one of the most exciting crypto presales with experts predicting a massive 50x price increase this year. Rollblock (RBLK) Making A Play For GambleFi Dominance As It Locks In Remarkable Q4 Growth Rollblock ( RBLK ) is on track for an incredible 2025 as it seeks to revolutionize the $500 billion online gambling industry. Its blockchain-powered platform has seen remarkable user growth recently, with a 600% surge in December. This is thanks to Rollblock’s comprehensive platform, which features over 7,000 casino classics alongside a sports betting feature that has helped to record over $1.75 million in wagered bets last month. As everything is recorded faithfully onto the Ethereum blockchain, there can be no allegations of bet tampering now that gamers can finally verify their bids for themselves using on-chain analytics. Rollblock’s deflationary tokenomics are groundbreaking, as its revenue-sharing model involves buying back RBLK tokens weekly. 60% of these tokens immediately burned to reduce the RBLK supply. The other 40% is reinvested into Rollblock to fund staking rewards of up to 30% APY. This has led the Rollblock presale to become one of the hottest in all of crypto right now, having raised more than $8.7 million in only a few short months. Stage 9 RBLK tokens are priced at just $0.046 and will face continued demand as Rollblock scales this year. Cardano (ADA) Whales Have Been Smashing The Buy Button Cardano holders have seen the value of their portfolios rise by more than 18% this week. The price of Cardano further rallied 2.6% in just the last day to reach $1.12. Insider analysis has revealed that large Cardano investors have been accumulating in recent days and snagged more than 30 million tokens in just 24 hours. This is a massive sign of confidence in Cardano’s future performance and many analysts feel confident that Cardano could reach $3 in the coming months. Ripple (XRP) Catalysts Line Up For 2025 Ripple rallied an unbelievable 41% in the last week. This has pushed the price of Ripple up to $3.27 which is now very close to its former high of $3.40 from two cycles ago. The following 12 months look bullish for Ripple with the likelihood of a spot Ripple ETF fund being approved. Ripple bulls are confident that Ripple could see a $10 price tag this year with consistent buying pressure. Now Is The Time For Rollblock To Shine Cardano and Ripple are set for significant appreciation this year, although neither of them will be able to match Rollblock (RBLK) for returns. Stage 9 tokens are selling out rapidly as investors continue to pile in, drawn by Rollblock’s potential and scarcity of supply.

Bitcoin dropped to a weekly low around the $90k area on January 13, Bitcoin has managed to surge over 14% to settle around $103,861 as of Friday. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization was hovering around the $3.8 trillion mark following an influx of liquidity that suggests traders had regained some of the confidence that was lost due to unfavorable macroeconomic data released the previous week. Why is Bitcoin going up? Bitcoin’s early week slowdown was reversed after the US Bureau of Labor Statistics released data showing a decline in core inflation, with the core Consumer Price Index dropping from 0.3% in November to 0.2% in December. On an annual basis, core inflation eased from 3.3% to 3.2%. Adding more fuel to the fire, several reports claimed that incoming US President Donald Trump could be signing executive on his first day in office. Crypto proponents are hopeful that Trump’s pro-crypto efforts could help bring fresh liquidity into the market as regulatory pushbacks ease under his pro-crypto administration. The market optimism was reflected among institutional players as well, with inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs returning towards the end of the week, which helped strengthen the upward rally. Following two days of outflows, over $1.38 billion went into the 12-spot ETF offerings, wiping off losses. Meanwhile, on-chain data suggested that buyer demand across the US was increasing. According to CryptoQuant, this was highlighted by Coinbase premium data, which measures US sentiment by comparing the difference between Coinbase’s BTC/USD pair and Binance’s BTC/USDT equivalent. CryptoQuant analysts noted that the Coinbase Premium had flipped positive for the first time since early January, driven by the hype around Trump’s inauguration. A positive premium means US traders are willing to increase BTC exposure. Bitcoin’s open interest had also rebounded after a holiday season dip, according to crypto commentator Miles Deutscher, who wrote “the bulls are back” in a January 17 X post. With momentum back in the market, experts predict the rally could continue over the weekend. According to analysts at Matrixport, a break above $103,000 would confirm that BTC was back in bullish territory. When writing, Bitcoin was priced at around $103,972, up 4.6% on the day. A bullish case for Bitcoin was highlighted by crypto analyst Elija, who noted that BTC often dips a few days before a presidential inauguration, only to surge by the day of the event. Bitcoin’s current price trajectory appears to follow a similar pattern. Well-followed analyst Ali Martinzed, in the meantime, pointed out that Bitcoin had broken out of a multi-month cup and handle pattern, which could push its price as high as $276,400 in the coming weeks. However, traders must be cautious about a possible “sell the news” event on the day of Trump’s inauguration. In such a scenario, Bitcoin’s price could face a temporary pullback as investors capitalize on recent gains, potentially disrupting the ongoing rally. Altcoins regain strength Altcoins had a profitable week as well, fuelled by Bitcoin’s end-of-the-week rally and lighter US CPI data that reignited investor enthusiasm. The altcoin season index went up by 5 points over the past week to hit 50. While this doesn’t confirm the onset of the alt season, it indicates that momentum is returning to the market. The top gainers for the week had all posted double-digit gains. Fartcoin Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) led the highest gains over the past week among the largest 100 crypto assets by market cap. Source: CoinMarketCap The Solana-based meme coin rallied 69.4% over the last 7 days to $1.42 at press time while its market cap has jumped to $1.41 billion. Most of the gains seen over the week came after Bitrue announced the launch of Fartcoin staking on its platform. Further, FARTCOIN’s listing on the crypto exchange SwissBorg and cross-chain swap protocol SWFT Blockchain also brought additional momentum to this week’s rally. XDC Network XDC Network (XDC) took the second spot with recorded gains of 62.7%, lifting its price to a 39-month high of $0.1375 while its market cap stood at $2 billion. Source: CoinMarketCap The altcoins trading volume has increased from $58 million observed on January 10 to over $138 million when writing. XDC’s recent rally came following its integration on PillarX, a multichain dApp platform. Further, crypto exchange OX.FUN also listed the altcoin on its leverage trading platform bringing more exposure to the crypto asset. XRP Ripple (XRP) rose 40.4% over the last week as its market cap soared to over $185 billion, cementing its position as the third-largest crypto asset in the market. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP traders pushed its price on hopes that Trump’s new administration would put an end to the 6-year-old litigation against Ripple brought upon by the US SEC. Adding to the momentum, asset management giant Grayscale Investments reopened its XRP Trust for accredited investors, which is expected to bring in institutional investments.

Bitcoin (BTC) still reigns supreme, but altcoins such as Ethereum (ETH) and the rapidly ascending BigBossInu are drawing attention. These assets are set for substantial growth ahead of the market rally. BigBossInu’s Presale Rises: A Power Play for Investors BigBossInu is storming onto the crypto scene with a high-demand presale that’s capturing investor interest. Early backers are positioned for considerable returns, making this a key opportunity. With pioneering technology and an ambitious roadmap, BigBossInu is poised for substantial gains. Unlike typical memes that thrive solely on their novelty, BigBossInu is building a solid foundation for sustainable growth. Its deflationary model and strategic tokenomics encourage long-term holding, while the dedicated team works on continuous improvements, making it much more than a passing trend in the crypto space. BigBossInu : $100,000 raised in minutes—grab your 50% EXTRA BONUS with code EXTRA50X! Limited time offer. >> Uniswap (UNI) has recently experienced a significant 14.78% gain over the past week, trading around $7.89. This surge follows the debut of Uniswap’s new Layer-2 solution, Unichain , designed to accelerate Ethereum’s scaling roadmap. This development positions UNI well for future growth in the decentralized exchange (DEX) space​. Solana (SOL) continues its bullish trend, trading at approximately $182.67. Analysts predict that if SOL can break the key resistance level of $196, it could rally toward $210 by January, 2025. However, the competition in the Layer-1 space, with rivals like Sui and Sei, could impact SOL’s long-term dominance​. Optimism (OP) has shown strong performance as a leading Layer-2 solution for Ethereum. It’s up around 15% in recent market movements, benefiting from increased demand for Ethereum scaling solutions. OP is expected to continue growing as more projects adopt its platform​. Arbitrum (ARB) , the largest Ethereum Layer-2 network by total value locked (TVL), is projected to see significant growth. Currently trading at around $0.74, ARB could reach $1.3 by the end of 2024, as Ethereum’s Layer-2 solutions gain traction and more users migrate to Layer-2 platforms​. >> Conclusion As the market readies for a bullish surge, Ethereum, Solana, and BigBossInu are among the top altcoin picks. BigBossInu’s presale shows significant promise, Uniswap’s new Layer-2 solution boosts its prospects, and Solana continues a strong bullish trend. These altcoins offer exciting potential, but as always, investors should weigh opportunities against market risks.

39122073,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=677964,1737176418,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Crypto Liquidations Cross $300 Million As Bitcoin Reclaims $102,000",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/crypto-liquidations-320-bitcoin-reclaims-102000/,"Data shows the cryptocurrency derivatives sector has seen a large amount of liquidations in the past day as Bitcoin and others have enjoyed a rally. Both Crypto Long & Short Liquidations Have Been High Today According to data from CoinGlass, a significant amount of liquidations have piled up on the derivatives side of the cryptocurrency sector following the market volatility. “Liquidation” here refers to the forceful closure that any open contract undergoes after it has amassed losses of a certain degree (the exact percentage of which may differ between platforms). Related Reading: Litecoin (LTC) Jumps 19%: What’s Behind The Rally? Below is a table that shows the data for the liquidations that have occurred in the cryptocurrency sector during the last 24 hours. As is visible, liquidations have totaled at almost $306 million in this window. Out of these, $154 million of the contracts involved were long positions, while $151 million were short ones. This remarkably even split suggests no side of the market was affected more than the other, which is interesting considering the context that Bitcoin and others coins have seen their prices rise during the past day. It would appear that the traders have been eager to place bullish positions with a high amount of leverage attached in this recovery rally, which is leading to any pullbacks on the way up catching them out and adding to the long liquidations counter. In terms of the contribution to the derivatives flush by the individual symbols, Bitcoin has once again come out on top with just under $98 million in liquidations. Ethereum (ETH) and XRP (XRP) have rounded out the top three with $37 million and $25 million in liquidations, respectively. This top three also happens to be the top three coins in the market cap list. Number four in liquidations doesn’t match up against the market cap ranking, however, as it’s in fact Dogecoin (DOGE) that has followed XRP with almost $16 million in contracts. The high contribution to the squeeze by the memecoin could be down to the fact that its popularity means speculators get driven to it more than larger altcoins like Solana (SOL). In some other news, the Bitcoin Open Interest has gone down relative to the market cap recently, as analyst James Van Straten has pointed out in an X post. The “Open Interest” refers to a measure of the total amount of Bitcoin-related derivatives positions that are currently open on all centralized exchanges. A high amount of speculative activity generally leads to volatility for the asset, so this metric’s ratio with the market cap should ideally stay low. Related Reading: XRP Surges Past $3.2 As Whale Activity Spikes 81% From the graph, it’s apparent that the ratio shot up to a high of 2.8% in November, but its value as since cooled off to about 2.4%, a healthier level.

Elon Bromance (ELOBRO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOBRO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Bromance by entering its contract address – FY7aYv7K3yEE9Z8hzgURj5z7biTE8Z6BpunBPAnCEpxj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOBRO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|SHIB|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-18 05:20:00

Experts like Eric Balchunas f rom Bloomberg call it a major move, with the ETF industry making a strong statement as Gensler leaves the building. “Gensler wasn’t even out of the building for 5 minutes and the ETF industry unloaded a massive crypto filing frenzy. Half a dozen so far,”Balchunas wrote. Nate Geraci, president of The ETF Store, took to social media and shared a series of new ETF filings that have been made in the past 48 hours. These filings include the VanEck Onchain Economy ETF, the Canary Litecoin ETF (19b-4), the Oasis Capital Digital Asset Debt Strategy ETF, the CoinShares Digital Asset ETF, and the ProShares Leveraged & Inverse XRP ETFs. Additionally, ProShares has also filed for both XRP Futures and Solana Futures ETFs. A Shift in Leadership and the SEC’s Crypto Stance The filing frenzy comes as a shift in leadership is underway. With Gensler stepping down and Paul Atkins likely to step in, the industry is poised for change. Among the most significant filings are those for the XRP and Solana Futures ETFs. This is crucial because the SEC has historically approved futures ETFs before allowing spot market ETFs for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. The filing of these futures ETFs signals the possibility of eventual approval for spot ETFs, setting the stage for major moves in the market.

As per market stats , the token has lost 15% from its price peak to trade at $221. Despite the notable decline of the Solana token , experts are bullish on its growth potential. On the X platform, a popular crypto analyst, Washigorira , projects an intermediate price turn for Solana to be $400. The trader made this statement while showcasing a market chart highlighting Solana’s Cup and Handle pattern, which looks ready to bull. Market dynamics and momentum are on Solana’s side, which could propel it to a significant rally in 2025. For instance, Grayscale has filed for a Solana ETF , while the Solana blockchain ranked number one in DEX transaction volume in 2024. Can Shiba Inu (SHIB) Set A New All-Time High In This Circle? The last time Shiba Inu’s price reached an all-time high was October 2021, when it traded at $0.00008845. While the current price value of the Shiba Inu token is about 69% away from reaching its ATH, investors are confident the meme coin can reach $0.0001 in 2025. According to an analysis from a crypto Twitter account, ShibSpain , once Shiba Inu crypto breaks its consolidation, it could rally to $0.0001. That’s about a 400% price gain from the current price of SHIB. In another Shiba Inu price prediction , Whales HQ , another popular account with over 300k followers, projected the SHIB price to $0.01 in 2025. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu will need to surpass its year-long high of $0.000035 in the coming weeks to show intent on its bullish potential. At the current trajectory, the possibilities are likely to occur. Elluminex (ELX): The Investment Gem Revolutionizing DeFi Transaction On TON Network With over 950 million active users and over a billion transactions so far on the TON network, cross-chain transactions are non-existent. Elluminex (ELX) is here to change all that with the introduction of a DeFi hub equipped with the necessary features to ensure seamless cross-chain transactions. For context, Elluminex helps TON users access over 40 blockchains with thousands of token liquidity for better market options, solving issues of interoperability in DeFi platforms. Elluminex will be the channel through which TON users can trade, stake, and track their portfolios across multiple blockchains. Outside that, Elluminex offers an educational academy that grants users DeFi literacy for better navigation. The Elluminex DEX is designed to offer low slippage, high liquidity, and advanced order types, allowing users to trade seamlessly and earn profits. Given that investing in projects in the early stage is where significant gains are made, the Elluminex over-the-counter platform is designed to grant users early access to new TON projects before their official listing on exchanges. Given these features, the Elluminex native $ELX token is an opportunity to invest in the revolutionary DeFi project and position oneself for profits. With a projection of 500% growth in presale. The 350M limited supply and deflationary mechanism further makes now the best time to invest in it. Best Investment Option For 2025 Both Solana and Shiba Inu are decent investment options ahead of 2025. However, with the Elluminex presale in the nascent stage, investors have the opportunity to triple their investment in the coming months. Given all the robust features and the limited total supply, the ELX token has the potential to lead the DeFi market in 2025.

Ripple (XRP), Shiba Inu And Remittix",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/three-crypto-investments-you-should-make-in-2025-ripple-xrp-shiba-inu-and-remittix/,"According to the latest data from CoinMarketCap, the fear & greed index currently stands at 60, favoring a bullish bias. This marks an important market shift, as the index has recently crossed into the greed zone for the first time in the past 10 days, suggesting a growing confidence among investors. As positive sentiment continues to grow, a swing back into the green is not just likely; it’s imminent. Many top altcoins continue to experience notable gains, allowing investors to narrow the list of promising altcoins to Ripple, Shiba Inu, and Remittix (RTX). Over the past week, Ripple price, Shiba Inu price, and RTX have witnessed significant price jumps and could see more significant rallies in the coming weeks. In the following paragraphs, we will discuss why investors favor these top altcoins for a successful 2025. Ripple Price Is Not Slowing Down Ripple price enjoyed a 10% intra-day price jump on Wednesday, catapulting its market capitalization towards the $200M milestone. XRP now sells at $3.22 , shortly after displacing USDT to become the third-largest cryptocurrency in the market. This surge saw Ripple price cross the $3 threshold for the first time since early 2018. Market experts have traced this breakout to the aggressive accumulation of XRP tokens last December, suggesting the ongoing rally of Ripple price wouldn’t be stopping anytime soon. They also believe that should Ripple resolve its legal issues with the United States Securities and Exchange and get an ETF approval under the new administration, Ripple price could reach up to 500% in Q1. News of this approval could potentially rally Ripple price by 5x, pushing XRP above the $15 price mark. As the legal tussle continues, institutional investors and other industry stakeholders are focused on which side will emerge victorious. Many of them are actively strategizing to position themselves advantageously in anticipation of the final court ruling. Would There Be More Upward Movements for the Shiba Inu Price? Shiba Inu price saw a 3.4% intra-day spike after a month-long consolidation phase. At press time, SHIB buys and sells at $0.00002184 , reflecting a 5.30% over the past week. Shiba Inu price could be one to watch after analysts confirm future price jumps in January, especially if the Shiba Inu price continues on the uptrend and breaks past the $0.00003 level this weekend. They are confident the Shiba Inu price could reach $0.00005 before January’s fall, sending SHIB approximately 131% upwards from the current market price. Moreover, a recent 4100% burn rate boost, steady accumulation, and a significant increase in whale activities would increase the current momentum and push the Shiba Inu price to higher highs. Market metrics also show the Shiba Inu price trajectory could see more upward movements after a recent upside break from its consolidation pattern. Remittix Heads For the Moon Cross-border payments have remained riddled with high transactional charges, slow processing time, and complex regulations. Remittix (RTX) , a PayFi solution, aims to resolve this prevalent issue, lending businesses a platform to facilitate crypto-to-fiat transactions. By enabling seamless transactions without unnecessary fees, Remittix could revolutionize how businesses interact with crypto and fiat currencies. The adoption of Remittix would allow cross-border payments in over 30 fiat currencies and address the needs of underbanked regions. Experts resonate with Remittix’s mission to tackle this long-standing issue, firmly believing that its potential makes it a must-have in 2025. Remittix has seen back-to-back price jumps in the last 30 days. Experts suggest Remittix’s compelling use case and promising potential will position RTX to maintain its upward trajectory. Now selling at $0.0217 per token, investors can join the aggressive accumulation of RTX tokens before Remittix heads for the moon.

The ADA price is headed to $5.00, Chainlink is earmarked to double in value, SUI is predicted to 5x, and the GambleFi token Rollblock’s breakout could reach 100x. Let’s take a closer look and see what the best cryptocurrencies have in store in this bull market. Rollblock (RBLK): A GambleFi Powerhouse Among the Best Cryptocurrencies The online gambling industry is huge, with massive profits to be made, but it’s an industry previously reserved for the millionaires and the moguls. However, Rollblock is opening up this lucrative sector to retail investors. Rollblock has launched their RBLK token to raise liquidity for their online casino and has seen almost $9 million in liquidity raised so far. The reason for Rollblock’s presale success is simple : Rollblock offers all their token holders a slice of the pie. Every week, Rollblock token holders get paid a share of the income generated by their online casino. Rollblock is a rare crypto that delivers a passive income without the need to sell to benefit from the token’s value. Cardano (ADA): ADA price headed to $5.00 on White House support The ADA price is one of the success stories of this bull market. The day before the election, the ADA price was $0.30. A month later, it was at $1.30. Like most other tokens, the ADA price took a beating in December, but now it is back, and headed to $5.00. There are plenty of rumours from Washington that Cardano will play a significant role in the Trump administration’s crypto plans. And why not? Cardano is the perfect solution for governmental work. Should Trump step up with his plans to bring in the first crypto-centric administration in US history, the ADA price might reach the stars. Chainlink (LINK): Cross-chain operability still in demand Many said that with the development of newer chains and their respective technological advancements, Chainlink’s cross-chain operability would become obsolete. Quite the opposite proved true, as Chainlink’s demand is shooting up. Chainlink is ranked 13 by market cap and is up a respectable 18% on YTD figures. The best cryptocurrencies have strong utility, and the use case for Chainlink indicates it will be here for the long run. Sui (SUI): 2024 success story aims even higher Sui was one of the best cryptocurrencies for 2024, rising from $0.80 to over $4.00 in the year, and it reached a new ATH early in January. Sui is the brainchild of the Meta team, and its sights are firmly set on the DeFi market. Sui is just inside the top 20 by market cap, but it is slated to go up the rankings as Coincodex predicts the Sui price will head to the $25.00 mark, returning a 5x return for its token holders. All the signs are here for Sui to continue its stratospheric rise. Conclusion The best cryptocurrencies to invest in will all outpace the market average in the ongoing bull run. The ADA price is due for a breakout, and Sui, and Chainlink will continue their incredible upward momentum. However, the new GambleFi token Rollblock is setting the world alight, proven by its ongoing presale. Rollblock is now available at $0.046.

This year marked significant acceptance, integration, and a secure place in daily commerce, defining a crucial phase in cryptocurrency’s progression. However, 2024 wasn’t solely about price charts and headlines—it was the year cryptocurrencies demonstrated their capacity to revolutionize sectors. A notable development was their entry into decentralized eCommerce, with Web3Bay (3BAY) at the forefront. This Ethereum-based cryptocurrency raised over half a million dollars shortly after its launch, drawing significant attention from the cryptocurrency community. Alongside Web3Bay, function-oriented cryptocurrencies like Chainlink (LINK) and Solana (SOL) are pioneering innovation and gaining momentum, preparing for an even more impactful 2025. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY) Offers 6430% ROI for Early Backers! Web3Bay is transforming eCommerce with its pioneering Web3 blockchain platform, often dubbed the “Amazon Killer.” This revolutionary marketplace addresses longstanding issues such as high fees, opacity, and restricted control in traditional eCommerce systems. By decentralizing operations, Web3Bay returns control to its users, ensuring security, reduced costs, and increased transparency. The platform’s presale has already amassed over $800,000 and sold 220 million tokens, indicating robust initial interest. Currently valued at just $0.004562, 3BAY tokens present a distinctive chance for early investors. With an anticipated listing price of $0.1959, backers could see gains of up to 6430% upon its release. Web3Bay’s aim goes beyond solving eCommerce issues—it’s fostering a community-driven marketplace where users influence its future. Token holders can enjoy a 5% saving on purchases and contribute to shaping the platform’s direction through decentralized governance. The excitement surrounding Web3Bay underscores its potential to disrupt the eCommerce sector and rival giants like Amazon. With tokens rapidly selling out, now is an ideal time to engage with this transformative project and participate in a new era of online shopping. Chainlink Price Prediction: Could LINK Reach $25? Chainlink (LINK) has regained its stride, returning to the $20 mark after a 10% rise in a single day. This resurgence is amid rising market optimism fueled by upcoming pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration, expected ETF approvals, and tax exemptions for US-based blockchain projects. Chainlink’s role in merging off-chain data with on-chain oracle feeds makes it vital in this evolving field. On-chain data shows major investors acquired 1.3 million LINK tokens, spending around $26 million during the recent market low. This whale activity not only shows confidence in Chainlink but also sets the stage for a possible price surge by reducing surplus supply. Now trading at $20.28, Chainlink faces a significant resistance level at $21.5. A solid break above this mark could propel LINK’s price toward $25, driven by positive sentiment and strategic large-scale purchases. Solana Price Analysis: Can SOL Hit $300 in 2025? Solana’s price is on the rise, currently around $200 after recovering from a 22.5% fall earlier in January. Solid fundamentals and interest from large financial institutions, particularly in Solana-based ETFs, bolster optimism. Major firms like Grayscale and VanEck have applied for Solana ETFs, with decisions expected between January 23–25. Analysts believe these ETFs could attract $3–6 billion in assets in their first year. The Solana network continues to outpace, overtaking Ethereum in DEX trade volume with $219.2 billion in Q4 2024. Innovations like Binance’s FDUSD integration and dominance in the AI agent market underscore its growth. Technical analysis indicates support at $175 and $188.15, with resistance at $266. The target price for Solana could reach $300 in Q1 2025, propelled by its dynamic ecosystem, institutional adoption, and continuous advancements in DeFi and AI. The Bottom Line! As crypto cements its role in the global financial system , its potential to transform industries like eCommerce is becoming evident. Platforms such as Web3Bay (3BAY) are not only leading this shift but also redefining decentralized commercial operations. With a substantial $800,000 raised in its presale, Web3Bay exemplifies the increasing demand for function-driven cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, the ascendancy of projects like Chainlink (LINK) and Solana (SOL) highlights the growing role of crypto across various industries.

As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but stepped down to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. At the start of 2025, BNB is trading just above the psychological mark of $700.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-18 06:03:00

Dogecoin (DOGE) trades at about $0.37, up 10% over the past week. Shiba Inu (SHIB) sits near $0.000022, logging a 5% weekly gain. Despite these boosts, a fresh project called Remittix may end up snatching a slice of their market share mainly by tackling real world problems while DOGE and SHIB rely on meme power. Dogecoin (DOGE) Still Rides Meme Culture Dogecoin has held onto meme coin fame for years, powered by viral posts and mentions from influencers. At $0.37, Dogecoin (DOGE) benefits when big holders move tokens around or when Tesla hints at fresh usage. Some watchers think Dogecoin might keep climbing if more businesses accept DOGE, or if devs manage to add cool features. However, critics say Dogecoin relies too heavily on internet buzz. If that hype ever fades, Dogecoin could lose ground to a utility based contender. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Fights to Stay on Top Similarly, Shiba Inu soared on meme hype, attracting a massive following. Now at $0.000022, Shiba Inu (SHIB) tries to shed its meme only image by adding new DeFi tools. While Shiba Inu fans celebrate token burns, the real question is whether SHIB can outlast waves of new tokens hitting the market. If major holders sell off, Shiba Inu might drop, letting a more practical token steal the spotlight. For SHIB to dominate in 2025, it must keep delivering updates that go beyond meme status. Why Remittix (RTX) Could Disrupt the Meme Coin Race While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu each bank on their strong communities, Remittix challenges them with a PayFi spin. In under a month, Remittix (RTX) shot from $0.0199 to $0.0207 with 175 million tokens sold, raising over $3.3 million. Rather than leaning on jokes or celebrity buzz, Remittix focuses on cross-border payments, letting users move crypto to fiat in under 24 hours with no hidden fees. That real-world usefulness sets Remittix apart from meme coins that rely mostly on hype. Meme Power vs. Real Utility Dogecoin (DOGE) soared thanks to memes and brand loyalty. Shiba Inu (SHIB) tries to prove it’s more than just a dog coin, but still leans on social media chatter to hold attention. Meanwhile, Remittix (RTX) has a Pay API that businesses love, enabling them to accept crypto seamlessly. If mainstream adoption grows for cheaper, faster payments, Remittix might overshadow meme coins stuck chasing fleeting trends. Analysts see Remittix’s approach as a direct solution to everyday finance problems, something few meme coins handle well. Which Meme Coin Will Dominate 2025? It’s unclear whether Dogecoin will remain king or if Shiba Inu can leap ahead. Both rely on memes and strong communities to hold their spots. But with a rising star like Remittix, people looking for real solutions might switch from DOGE or SHIB to a more practical token. Even though Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) have millions of fans, that momentum can shift fast if traders see a better altcoin. By attacking real world pain points, Remittix (RTX) could become the coin that truly rises when hype fades. Remittix Already Carving Out a Spot Dogecoin and Shiba Inu remain meme coin giants, likely to keep duking it out for top dog status in 2025. Yet if you crave a token that solves cross border payment hassles, Remittix stands as the utility based choice. With a swift presale climb and over $3 million raised, Remittix (RTX) might attract users who see beyond memes and want tangible benefits. That’s why many think Remittix can seize part of the meme coin market share and keep growing while DOGE and SHIB shuffle through more memes. Eager to see why Remittix might be your next big pick?

Pepe Coin (PEPE) embodied this in 2023, rising by an astonishing 107,099,830.45%. An early PEPE investment of just $340 could have become $30,000, sparking investor excitement. A new cryptocurrency valued at $0.175, Rexas Finance (RXS), is attracting considerable interest in 2025, mainly from PEPE enthusiasts who want to emulate its significant earnings. RXS is set to rally 89x as it targets $15.50 and has attracted Pepe coin investors looking to make $30,000 from a $340 investment like in 2023. RXS: The Rising Star Of 2025 With its strong presale performance and creative ecology, Rexas Finance is making waves . Beginning its presale trip in September 2024 at $0.030 at stage 1 presale, RXS has increased by 485%, reaching $0.175 in stage 11.

The presale has already sold 402,540,943 RXS tokens, raising $37,070,065. The token is becoming increasingly buzzworthy. One PEPE investor has designated RXS as the “next PEPE,” claiming RXS is a token for 100x returns. Why RXS Is Drawing PEPE Investors At the time of writing, RXS is affordable at just $0.175 per token for those seeking high-growth prospects without ample cash. If forecasts are correct, a $340 investment in RXS might yield gains comparable to PEPE’s explosive climb.

Also, Solana continued its ascension over the $200 mark and garnered a lot of cheers when it hit over $200 after a little bit of a slow start in January. Stories began to circulate about the possibility of a new dApp that DTX holders would use in the days to come following a wonderful new trading interface. The DTX Exchange is known for its decentralized and hybrid approach, creating a major blockchain platform under a single roof as a one-stop shop where you can exchange almost every type of financial instrument: stocks, forex, and ETFs. As investors look for the next big opportunity, the DTX seems to be gaining more hype, making it highly tempting for investment. Solana Price Surges Past $200 Amidst Market Optimism The Solana price recently surged past $200, a testament to its strong technical foundation and growing adoption. Currently trading at around $210, SOL has seen an impressive 11% increase over the past day and week, reflecting a bullish sentiment in the market. The market capitalization of Solana stands at approximately $102 billion, solidifying its position as a leading blockchain platform. Analysts predict that SOL could reach $300 in the first quarter of 2025, driven by factors such as potential ETF approvals and increasing institutional interest. The technical indicators for Solana are also promising, with a neutral Relative Strength Index (RSI) and a bullish MACD signal, suggesting potential for further upward momentum. However, the 50-day moving average may act as a short-term resistance level, which could influence price movements in the coming days. BONK Holders Shift Focus to DTX Exchange Amid Market Volatility BONK, a popular meme coin, has experienced significant volatility, with its price currently at $0.00002946. Despite a recent 6% increase over the past day and week, BONK holders are diversifying their portfolios by embracing the DTX Exchange. Indeed, virtual organizations have been forging trails and achieving presale triumphs by collecting $11.9 million and carrying some 300,000 wallet addresses. They are also enticing potential investors who seek beyond traditional cryptocurrency trading in high-leverage trade options plus financial assets variety. The upcoming launch of the live DTX Exchange in Q1 2025 is highly anticipated, with features like tokenized ETF trading set to enhance user experience. The rights to governance and the opportunities for profit sharing associated with investing in DTX go well beyond the normal welfare of those investors who follow the speculative trading patterns that might be characteristic of commodities. DTX Exchange: The Next Big Thing in Crypto Trading Traders and investors now agree that when it comes to a perfect trade, DTX Exchange is the only place to be in. Combining coal and speed, the DTX Exchange revolutionized the scene of classical trading models. Harnessing the VulcanX blockchain meant DTX had created a testing mechanism for speeds of up to 200,000 transactions per second. This scalability, combined with the availability of over 100,000 currency pairs and up to 1000x leverage, positions DTX as a major competitor to established exchanges like Binance and Robinhood. As DTX moves into its 7th stage, the token price is set to increase from $0.14 to $0.16, reflecting growing investor confidence. With its secure custody solution, Phoenix Wallet, and upcoming products like ETF trading, DTX is set to revolutionize the way investors interact with financial markets. The hype around DTX is undeniable, and it’s clear that this platform is one to watch in the coming months. Conclusion Even though Solana continues to hog the limelight on the crypto scene, a different lot of BONK owners have started to embrace DTX Exchange for a variety of their assets. Not only is DTX Exchange bringing a new kind of excitement to the investors but with its innovative offerings and rapid growth, it is being constantly spoken about. Its progress in the DTX Exchange presale and nearing launch is obvious: it is anticipating becoming a field leader.

Qubetics: Leading the Revolution in Real-World Asset Tokenisation And now, let’s talk about the coin that’s making all the headlines—Qubetics ($TICS).

Analyst Says The ‘Final Shakeout’ Is Over,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/altcoins-about-to-take-off-analyst-says-the-final-shakeout-is-over/,"After a red Monday, the crypto market seems to be moving toward a green end of the week, registering an 18.54% increase from this week’s lows. Altcoins have broken out of a bullish formation, fueling investors’ optimism about the upcoming Altseason. Related Reading: XRP Hits Seven-Year High After 16% Surge, Is A New ATH Around The Corner? Altcoins Final Shakeout ‘Completed’ On Friday, the crypto market recovered from its recent correction, with Bitcoin (BTC) reclaiming the $100,000 mark after days of hovering below this resistance level. Similarly, The King of Altcoins, Ethereum (ETH), reclaimed the $3,400 range after dipping below a key support level earlier this week. Other leading altcoins like Solana and XRP have also gained bullish momentum, with the former reclaiming crucial levels and the latter nearing its all-time high (ATH). Notably, the total crypto market capitalization, excluding BTC and ETH, surged 4% in the last 24 hours, hitting its highest point since the December retraces. Altcoins broke out on a three-year downtrend during the November-December rally, surging to $1.1 trillion, its highest market cap since 2021. However, the sector struggled to record significant gains after the end-of-year corrections, dropping around 25% from the post-election highs. Despite the performance, several crypto analysts predicted that Alts would see a bullish start to the year. On Monday, Altcoins fell to its lowest price range in weeks, dipping to a $900 billion market cap, but is now retesting last month’s highs. Amid the current performance, Titan of Crypto suggests that the “final shakeout seems completed.” The analyst previously asserted that the “grand finale” was around the corner, signaling that alts were about to explode. Alts Following Q1 2024 Performance? Recently, the analyst pointed out that a golden cross is “imminent” in the Altcoins chart. According to the post, “It’s only a matter of time before FOMO kicks in,” as 2021’s golden cross, which occurred at the start of that year, kickstarted a massive Altseason. Titan of Crypto added that early 2025 “could echo the explosive Altcoins rally of early 2021,” noting that the crypto market’s performance seemed to resemble its performance from four years ago. Meanwhile, crypto investor Miky Bull noted that Altcoins seems to be repeating its Q1 2024 playbook, which could lead to a “rally déjà vu.” Per the chart, the sector broke out of a multi-month trendline at the end of 2023 before a brief correction period and retest of the new levels. Then, Altcoins exploded at the beginning of Q1 2024, rallying until March, which is “the cogent reason that this Altseason might run till March.” Related Reading: Chainlink ‘Ready To Breakout’: Analyst Eyes $50 Target Amid Whale Accumulation The investor asserted that Altcoins market cap “has just completed its retest Expansion phase in full force loading,” as the crypto market capitalization, excluding the top ten tokens, had broken out of a 42-day accumulation period, which meant that “alts rally will follow.” Similarly, analyst Jelle highlighted that Alts had formed a bullish pennant “right below all-time high resistance,” which could lead to a massive rally once it broke. After the recent surge, Altcoins have broken out of the bullish formation, leaving “price discovery just inches away.” Featured Image from Unsplash.com, Chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|altcoins|altcoins rally|alts|altseason|btc|crypto analyst|crypto market bull run 2025|crypto market cap|crypto market correction|ETH|ETHUSDT|Sol|total2|xrp,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-18 06:30:26

Trump Buys Solana (TRUMPSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Buys Solana by entering its contract address – 8Ruz6rzYPpKHActX3jo49v8WBhiJ5KsGM6dyCghQj3i – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-18 06:45:00

However, it faces growing competition from other meme coins. Dogecoin (DOGE), which seems poised for a good year due to Musk’s involvement in politics , remains its biggest rival. The Necessary Factors The popular meme coin performed quite well in 2024, and at one point, it had secured a position among the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Over the past several months, though, many of its rivals surpassed it. The self-proclaimed Dogecoin killer is currently the 19th-biggest digital asset, and we asked ChatGPT whether it can return to the top 10 club in 2025. The AI-powered chatbot said this is possible but requires several vital factors to be in place. First, it claimed that SHIB could climb the crypto ladder if its ecosystem continued to expand this year. One example is the further progress of the layer-2 scaling solution, Shibarium. The protocol, whose ultimate goal is to foster the development of the meme coin, recently reached a new milestone. As CryptoPotato reported , the total transactions processed on the network exceeded 800 million. Next on ChatGPT’s list is the potential growth of SHIB’s community in the next 12 months. The SHIB Army consists of millions of investors, developers, and proponents, and their collective actions, both positive and negative, can affect the token’s market performance. Third, the chatbot estimated that SHIB’s eventual rally this year would also depend on the overall crypto market conditions. The current bullish environment and the upcoming pro-crypto president of the United States – Donald Trump (according to his presidential campaign) – suggest that the following months could be beneficial to the industry. However, only time will show whether this will be the case. The Competition It is important to note that SHIB’s competitors and other new entrants may challenge SHIB to get a top position. Some examples include Pepe (PEPE), Pudgy Penguins (PENGU), ai16z (AI16Z), and more. Shiba Inu’s bigges t rival remains the largest meme coin in terms of market capitalization – Dogecoin (DOGE). According to many industry participants, the OG meme coin may also experience a great year. After all, Elon Musk – one of its biggest fans – will enter the US political scene. He will lead a designated agency called the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.). Its main goal will be to reduce government spending and solve the problem of “the suffocating massive federal bureaucracy. “ However, many Dogecoin proponents have noticed that the division’s abbreviation is the same as their favorite coin, envisioning good days ahead for the dog-themed token during Musk’s leadership.

Despite its 5% gain on the weekly chart, long term ETH holders have become increasingly frustrated with its sluggish price performance in recent months. As a result, many ETH holders are now turning to Remittix , an emerging low market cap crypto, in search of higher returns. Remittix offers early stage entry with the potential for significant gains. This text explores why Remittix attracts ETH holders and why it might be the next big thing in the crypto market. Remittix presale gains momentum: The low market cap crypto poised for 100x returns In contrast to Ethereum’s slow price movement, this new low market cap crypto, Remittix, is generating excitement due to its innovative use case and early stage investment opportunity. Similar to Ripple’s early days, Remittix seeks to resolve cross border transaction issues with its new PayFi protocol, making global payments easier by removing needless hurdles. With Remittix, more than 40 cryptocurrencies can be converted to fiat and transferred to global bank accounts. In addition, Remittix users enjoy flat-rate fees without hidden charges and variable conversion rates. This transparency sets Remittix apart from traditional financial systems like Stripe and Wise, which often impose layers of fees and leave senders unsure of what their recipients will receive. But that’s not all; businesses, too, stand to benefit from Remittix’s offerings, particularly through the Remittix Pay API. This robust tool lets firms accept payments in cryptocurrency while settling in fiat. This is a real revolution, as Freelancers, online retailers and global service providers can access funds quickly and straightforwardly manage payments. At the center of the Remittix ecosystem sits the powerful $RTX token, engineered for resilience and growth. With a capped supply of 1.5 billion, analysts believe growing adoption could pave the way for significant demand entering the market and catapulting the price of RTX tokens. Is the ETH price poised to set a new ATH in 2025? For all its talk of poor performance, the ETH price seems to have regained momentum alongside the broader crypto market, posting a 5% weekly gain. The ETH price, now at $3,415.82, has rebounded by 60% in the last two weeks following a dip below $3,000 on January 13. This fluctuating performance has prompted market participants to watch ETH’s next possible move closely. The technical indicators indicate a notable shift in market behavior, with the exchange reserves for Ethereum recently dropping to a two month low, suggesting that fewer tokens are being sold and more are being held. This is not a good sign for the ETH price, but in 2025, it could be seen pushing against several resistance levels. First, the ETH price faces strong resistance at around $3,500. Analysts believe that clearing this psychological zone is crucial for any attempt at a sustainable upward trajectory in the ETH price. Conclusion Ethereum remains at the very pinnacle of a bubbling crypto market but its recent price underperformance has not gone unnoticed by investors looking for high reward potential. Remittix presale offers a compelling alternative, with its high growth potential at a low market cap of $0.0207. Take action before it’s too late!

XYZ is currently undervalued , and with major listings on the way, presale participants stand to secure life-changing gains. >>>Be Part of the 2025 Breakout Story—XYZ Is Waiting for You! Terra Classic (LUNC): Reviving Stability in the Crypto World Terra Classic, known by its token LUNC, is shaking up the world of digital money. It uses stablecoins tied to real-world currencies like the U.S. dollar and South Korean won. This means its value stays steady, making it a reliable way to send money globally. Started in 2018 and launched in 2019, Terra aimed to combine the stability of regular money with the speed and security of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. By offering fast and affordable transactions, it became a promising player in the blockchain space. In May 2022, Terra introduced a new chapter by launching a new chain named Terra (LUNA) and rebranding the original as Terra Classic. The original token became LUNA Classic (LUNC). This shift is similar to the Ethereum split in 2017, marking a significant moment in crypto history. Despite past challenges, LUNC holds potential in today’s market. Its focus on stable, fast payments sets it apart from many other coins. As the crypto market seeks reliability amid volatility, Terra Classic’s approach makes it a coin worth watching. Kaspa: The Fast Lane of Cryptocurrency Evolution Kaspa (KAS) is a new cryptocurrency that’s changing the game. It uses a technology called GHOSTDAG, which allows blocks created at the same time to coexist and be ordered together. Unlike traditional blockchains that discard these parallel blocks, Kaspa embraces them. This means its network isn’t just a chain but a web of blocks, making it faster and more efficient. Currently, Kaspa processes one block per second, with goals to reach 10 or even 100 per second. Confirmations are quick, mainly limited by internet speed. It also has cool features like Reachability to explore the network’s structure and data pruning to keep things running smoothly. In today’s crypto market, Kaspa looks promising. Its innovative approach tackles common issues like speed and scalability. While other coins struggle with slow transactions, Kaspa’s design could handle high rates with swift confirmations. This makes it an attractive option compared to other proof-of-work coins. As the market trends toward faster and more efficient cryptocurrencies, Kaspa could gain significant attention. It’s a coin to watch, as it might play a key role in the future of digital money. Stellar Lumens: Connecting the World with Fast and Affordable Payments Stellar Lumens (XLM) is a digital coin that makes sending money around the world easy and cheap. Launched in 2014, Stellar is a network that helps move funds quickly without high costs. It isn’t tied to any one country’s money system. Instead, it works with all kinds of currencies, including dollars, euros, and even other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. People can use Stellar apps to send money globally, and businesses can build tools on the network for payments and currency exchange. The goal is to improve how money moves between people and banks everywhere. Is XLM a good choice in today’s market? With the growing need for fast and low-cost transfers, Stellar stands out. It has processed billions of transactions and teamed up with major companies. Unlike other coins that try to replace banks, Stellar works with them. This makes it attractive to those who want to see blockchain technology enhance the current financial system. In a market where fees and slow transactions are problems, Stellar offers a solution. Compared to some other cryptocurrencies that can be slow or expensive to use, XLM is swift and affordable. This might make it an appealing option for both individuals and businesses right now. Empowering Creators: How TRON’s TRX is Changing the Digital World TRON (TRX) is making a splash in the digital content scene. Launched in 2017 by the Tron Foundation, it started as a token on Ethereum but moved to its own network a year later. TRON’s mission is clear: give full ownership and rewards to digital content creators. Instead of big platforms like YouTube or Facebook taking a hefty cut, TRON lets fans reward creators directly. This means creators get more for their work, and fans support them without middlemen. The platform supports smart contracts and decentralized apps, making it a strong alternative to Ethereum. Using a system similar to Bitcoin, all transactions are public and traceable. TRON aims to build a decentralized internet where anyone can create and share content freely without worrying about high fees. In today’s market, with a growing interest in decentralization, TRX stands out. Its focus on empowering creators and low transaction costs makes it attractive compared to other cryptocurrencies. As more people look for alternatives to traditional platforms, TRON’s approach could make TRX a promising choice in the evolving crypto landscape. Conclusion Although LUNC, KAS, XLM, and TRX have strong potential, XYZVerse (XYZ) uniquely blends sports and memes in a community-driven ecosystem poised for significant growth.

The launch was announced by Donald Trump on X, with others quickly joining the thread to share their speculation and support. The Solana meme coin ecosystem, as a whole, has started gaining traction since this announcement and it is expected that the TRUMP meme coin will require traders and investors to brace up for good times. Donald Trump Launches TRUMP Meme Coin Donald Trump, the US President-elect, has launched a Solana meme coin, TRUMP, and it can be claimed from the official website, as per the announcement. The launch was made public through his official X profile , sharing that the sentiment behind launching TRUMP is to celebrate winning. Anthony Pompliano, the Founder & CEO of Professional Capital Management, has expressed his excitement about the launch of the TRUMP meme coin. He has even asked everyone to ‘buckle up’, saying that the financial markets are not ready for what the Solana meme coin is about to bring. Anthony has further highlighted that it has already achieved a market cap of $8 billion in just 3 hours of its official launch. As per the details, TRUMP meme coin can be bought using a debit card or a cryptocurrency. Having a TRUMP meme coin essentially makes the holder a part of the Trump Meme Community where the culture of success and optimism are encouraged. TRUMP Transactions and Speculation TRUMP transactions have started flowing in with millions being spent and earned by interested investors. The Founder of OxSun Group, 0xsun.sol, has reportedly earned more than $3.7 million on TRUMP. They had bought 999,895 TRUMP tokens by spending 3,000 SOL tokens worth $653k. Later, 0xsun.sol sold them for 3,616 SOL worth $812k. Source: Lookonchain, X Another trader bought 5.97 million TRUMP using $1.1 million USDC, later sold 543k TRUMP tokens for $404k for a profit of almost $20 million, leaving behind 5.43 million yet to be sold. Source: Lookonchain, X That said, the crypto community instantly began speculating that the announcement was either a scam or a joke by someone who gained access to his X account without authorization. Such speculations are being put to rest as reports about more TRUMP transactions continue to surface. For instance, OnChain Lens, on X, shared that a whale spent 2.72 million USDC to buy 6.1 million TRUMP tokens. The whale then sold 5.52 million TRUMP tokens for a price of $6.38 million, leaving behind 575,334 TRUMP meme coins worth $1.88 million while earning profits. Given the pace, TRUMP may soon join the list of top meme coins to buy earlier this year. Performance of the Solana Meme Coin TRUMP price has increased more than 100% in the last 24 hours, with the price currently trading at $12.46. The 24-hour low and high are $6.24 and $15.13, respectively. Some of the top Solana meme coins have recorded significant surges in their values BONK price is up by 9.9% in the last 24 hours and is being traded at $0.00003178.

This development comes just days before he is sworn in for his second term in the White House. The price movement of the TRUMP token is wild. At 12:45 AM ET, the meme coin reached a $10 billion market cap. Three minutes later, its value soared to $11.6 billion. The coin’s market cap is currently at $15 billion. The Truth Social post went out first reading: “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW .” ~ Truth Social A trader secures over $20 million profit from TRUMP meme token sale Almost an hour after the first post, President-elect Donald Trump replicated his message on Truth Social on X, inviting his followers to trade with his meme token. GetTrumpMemes also promised rewards to the first 2,500 people who take up the token, saying they will be eligible for an airdrop. In their post, they added that the Trump Community could be accessed from Telegram and encouraged people to engage with it, saying, “Miss out, or become a winner.” Some have praised Trump’s move to launch the token, while others have resorted to criticism. For starters, AI and crypto commentator Brian Krassenstein believes it’s wrong for Trump to benefit from meme tokens about his presidency. On the contrary, Ross Coin’s Churl Bistros even commended Trump saying, that’s my president. Moreover, meme coin traders are snapping up the coin in large numbers, pushing its price to $13.6 at the time of writing. Lookonchain even said a trader amassed more than $20 million in profit in just one hour. Just 90 seconds after Trump revealed the new token’s launch on Truth Social, he purchased 5.97 million TRUMP tokens. Later, he sold 543000 TRUMP tokens for roughly $404k, earning himself a $20 million profit. Some believe Trump’s Truth Social account was hacked BlockNews cautioned that Trump’s Truth Social account is likely hacked, asking the public not to interact with it. Following the agency’s post, the founder of Tennessee Investors Company, Daniel Evans, questioned the likelihood of an account attack, saying, if the account had indeed been hacked, why was it still running? Tesla investor BlackAppple.eth also believed that Trump’s account was not hacked and called out the rumors. Another X user criticized the news company, saying so many people missed out on a great trading opportunity because of them. Meanwhile, on-chain detectives raised potential red flags, such as the project’s apparent seeding with millions of dollars from Binance and Gate, two exchanges that do not serve U.S. consumers. However, as more research was done and Trump’s social media messages continued to be posted, other apparent worries subsided. Trump is expected to issue a day-one executive order regarding cryptocurrency, which could be the first of many. He is believed to be readying directives that could reshape the American crypto landscape for builders and investors alike.

When the coin lists at $0.0006, your investment jumps to $21,000. With a projected price of $0.006 post-listing, that $5,000 could grow to an eye-watering $210,000—a staggering 4,000% ROI.

The listing in the Innovation Zone immediately boosted its trading volume and liquidity, leading to a 45% price surge within hours.

The rumors originated from an Axios report, which was shared by Degen News on X. The report alleged that Trump criticized an unknown company in a heated exchange with its representatives, accusing the company’s representatives of failing to support him during a crucial time, and abandoning him for Kamala Harris. According to Degen News, unnamed sources linked this interaction to Ripple, sparking speculation about the relationship between the company and Trump. Degen News shared this report even though the Axios report did not name Ripple in its report, and neither the Trump transition team nor Ripple confirmed the claim.

Alderoty and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse met with Donald Trump recently. Garlinghouse described the meeting as a strong start to 2025, reducing the credibility of these dissent claims between Trump and Ripple. Alderoty, addressing these allegations, emphasized the lack of credible evidence and denounced the sources behind the rumors. “Wow, unnamed sources? Here’s a named source: me,” he stated. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 As someone present at the meeting with Trump, he is the right person to set the record straight. He went on to call the story a fabrication by a “third-tier crypto rag” and questioned the motives of those perpetuating the narrative. The rumor gained traction due to the political implications of Ripple’s history. Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen has previously made significant contributions to the Harris campaign, raising questions about the company’s political affiliations. However, no evidence supports the claims that Ripple’s interactions with Trump were anything but cordial. The Importance Of Fighting Misinformation The rise of misinformation has plagued global media for some time now. Alderoty was quick to combat this false narrative, especially with the company’s ongoing legal battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). While the rumor was quickly debunked, it underscores the importance of verifying information. Alderoty’s response has reassured the XRP community, many of whom viewed the rumor as an attempt to sow doubt about Ripple’s leadership and direction. With Donald Trump’s administration about to take control of the White House, many in the crypto world believe the SEC will drop its lawsuit against Ripple , and a good relationship with Ripple could help expedite this process.

A Comprehensive Look at the DeFi Challenger,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/crypto-can-lightchain-ai-disrupt-xrps-dominance/,"The post Crypto- Can Lightchain AI Disrupt XRP’s Dominance? A Comprehensive Look at the DeFi Challenger appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Crypto enthusiasts are buzzing over whether Lightchain AI could disrupt XRP’s dominance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. With its innovative blend of artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology, Lightchain AI presents a groundbreaking approach that has the potential to shake up the market. Plus, the Lightchain AI Presale is now live, offering early adopters a chance to join the platform before it gains even more traction. By utilizing its unique Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain AI aims to power faster, more efficient decentralized applications. As the platform continues to grow, it could redefine the DeFi landscape and emerge as a serious competitor to XRP and other leading cryptocurrencies. The Rise of Lightchain AI and its Ambitions in DeFi Lightchain AI is a pioneering blockchain project that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) with decentralized finance (DeFi) to address scalability, efficiency, and privacy challenges. By introducing the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), Lightchain AI enables real-time AI computations directly on the blockchain, enhancing the performance of decentralized applications (dApps). This integration allows for more intelligent and efficient DeFi solutions, such as optimized lending protocols and yield strategies. With a focus on scalability and interoperability, Lightchain AI aims to revolutionize the DeFi landscape by providing a platform that seamlessly combines AI capabilities with blockchain technology. Comparing Lightchain AI and XRP- Key Differences and Advantages XRP and Lightchain AI (LCAI) are two distinct cryptocurrencies, each with unique features and advantages. XRP- Established Cross-Border Payment Solution XRP, developed by Ripple Labs, is renowned for its efficiency in facilitating cross-border payments. Its consensus mechanism enables transaction validation within 3 to 5 seconds, making it a preferred choice for financial institutions seeking swift and cost-effective international transactions. Lightchain AI- Integrating Blockchain with Artificial Intelligence Lightchain AI is an emerging project that integrates artificial intelligence with blockchain technology. Its innovative approach focuses on optimizing smart contracts, improving liquidity, and enhancing the performance of decentralized applications (dApps). By combining AI with blockchain, Lightchain AI aims to address key limitations in current DeFi systems, such as transaction speed, cost, and inefficiency. Key Differences and Advantages XRP and Lightchain AI offer distinct use cases and technological advantages. XRP is focused on cross-border payments and financial transactions, making it a strong contender for institutional adoption. On the other hand, Lightchain AI combines blockchain and artificial intelligence to address critical challenges across multiple industries. In terms of technology, XRP utilizes a consensus protocol for rapid transaction validation, enabling real-time global payments. Meanwhile, Lightchain AI’s integration of AI with blockchain positions it as a groundbreaking innovation in the blockchain space. While XRP has established itself as a leader in cross-border payments, Lightchain AI’s unique approach has the potential to revolutionize various sectors, highlighting its significant growth potential. In summary, while XRP offers a proven solution for financial transactions, Lightchain AI’s unique combination of AI and blockchain technology presents new opportunities for innovation and growth across diverse industries. The Future of Defi- Will Lightchain AI Overcome XRP’s Stronghold? The decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape is evolving rapidly, with Lightchain AI emerging as a formidable contender to XRP’s established position. XRP has long been recognized for its efficiency in cross-border payments, leveraging its consensus mechanism to facilitate swift international transactions. However, Lightchain AI introduces a novel integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with blockchain technology, aiming to address scalability, efficiency, and privacy challenges within the DeFi sector. By combining AI with blockchain, Lightchain AI seeks to enhance the performance of decentralized applications (dApps), offering solutions that could potentially surpass the capabilities of traditional platforms like XRP. As the DeFi ecosystem continues to expand, Lightchain AI’s innovative approach positions it as a strong challenger, with the potential to redefine industry standards and possibly overtake XRP’s dominance in the future. With its ongoing presale and increasing adoption, only time will tell if Lightchain AI can disrupt XRP’s stronghold in the DeFi space. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-18 07:21:43

Polygon price prediction for 2025 expects the price of POL to surge toward $1.57. By 2031, we expect the POL price to record a maximum price of $13.01. Polygon, an Ethereum side chain and layer two scaling solution, has experienced substantial uptake by enterprises and industries in the last year. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, POL. This raises the question: Can POL’s price reach $10? This forecast for Polygon’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the POL price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Polygon Ticker Symbol POL Rank 12 Price $0.478 Price change 24H -4.2% Market cap $7,240,424,326 Circulating supply 9,899,469,069.28 POL Trading volume 24h $210M All-time high $2.92 All-time low $0.003012 POL price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $0.478 Price Prediction $ 0.581156 (11.48%) Fear & Greed Index 76 (Extreme Greed) Sentiment Bearish Volatility 13.21% Green Days 14/30 (47%) 50-Day SMA $ 0.54237 200-Day SMA $ 0.479584 14-Day RSI 50.75 Polygon technical analysis: POL price faces bearish pressure at $0.52 POL price analysis shows a bearish pressure of around $0.52. Resistance for POL is present at $0.5415. Support for POL/USD is present at $0.463. The POL price analysis for January 18 confirms that POL faces bearish pressure around $0.52. Currently, the bears are aiming for a drop below Fib channels. POL price analysis 1-day chart: Polygon aims for immediate decline POL witnessed a bearish rally after bulls failed to push the altcoin above immediate Fib levels. Over the last 24 hours, the price has been struggling to hold around $0.52. The price of Polygon is now testing the $0.47 support line. The 24-hour volume surged to $25 million, showing increased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.478, falling by over 4.2% in the last 24 hours. POL/USD price chart. Image source: TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has declined from its previous level and currently hovers around 48, showing that bears are slowly gaining price momentum. The SMA-14 level suggests upward volatility in the next few hours. POL/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a hold below EMA trend lines The 4-hour POL price chart suggests POL continues to experience bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. As the price continues to face resistance near the immediate Fib level, bears aim to dominate the chart by holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. POL/USD price chart. Image source: TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.69, hinting that sellers are trying to build pressure near support levels and boost a downward correction. Additionally, the MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, and the indicator aims for a negative momentum, strengthening selling positions. POL technical indicators: Levels and action Daily Simple Moving Average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $ 0.566659 SELL SMA 5 $ 0.550804 SELL SMA 10 $ 0.506696 BUY SMA 21 $ 0.505492 BUY SMA 50 $ 0.54237 SELL SMA 100 $ 0.456986 BUY SMA 200 $ 0.479584 BUY Daily Exponential Moving Average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.506268 BUY EMA 5 $ 0.52523 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.557772 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.573506 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.530917 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.494057 BUY EMA 200 $ 0.517791 BUY What to expect from POL price analysis next? The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the POL price from an immediate surge. However, if POL’s price successfully breaks above $0.5415, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.6285. POL/USDT Chart If bulls cannot initiate a surge, POL’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.463, resulting in a correction to $0.4115. Is POL a good investment? POL token can be a good investment option in the long run as the project develops a roadmap for its Polygon 2.0 version. Polygon collaborates with diverse industries to enhance adoption, focusing on NFT solutions and Ethereum scalability. Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is POL price down today? Following a sell off around $0.5, POL’s price failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a break below immediate Fib channels. Will POL price touch $1? Yes, POL price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2025. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will POL Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and POL gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030. Is POL a good long-term investment? As Polygon continues to expand its offerings, it gains a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, POL can be a good long-term investment option. Recent news/ Opinions on POL The Aave community is considering ending its operations on Polygon due to concerns about an upcoming review of the risk profile for bridged assets. A proposal on Dec. 13 by Aave founder Marc Zeller suggests reassessing risk parameters for Aave v2 and v3 on Polygon. POL price prediction January 2025 Following Donald Trump’s election victory, the crypto market witnessed a robust price surge. As a result, the altcoin market skyrocketed, resulting in a bull run in the Polygon price. However, analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices following a bearish December. We expect POL to record a minimum price of $0.57 and a maximum price of $0.72, with an average of $0.6 in January. POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction January 2025 $0.57 $0.6 $0.72 POL price prediction 2025 Ethereum fees increase dramatically during a bull market, making it too expensive for regular cryptocurrency users. That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $1.34. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year. POL Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high POL Price Prediction 2025 $1.34 $1.39 $1.57 POL Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $2.07 $2.12 $2.39 2027 $3.03 $3.11 $3.60 2028 $4.28 $4.43 $5.36 2029 $6.08 $6.26 $7.41 2030 $8.93 $9.18 $10.51 2031 $11.22 $12.25 $13.01 Pol price forecast for 2026 Polygon has made PolygonzkEVM available to everyone, making it one of the first ZK Rollups to do so. This is a big step forward for Polygon and gives it an advantage. With its growing use by businesses, innovative technology, and past success, Polygon could reach a new all-time high in 2026. According to the forecast and technical analysis, Polygon’s price is expected to hit a minimum of $2.07 in 2026. The maximum price projection is $2.39, with an average value of $2.12.

This initiative strengthens the Trump-backed crypto project’s ties with Justin Sun’s Tron ecosystem. However, there are no confirmations on the amount of tokens Trump’s crypto organization intends to add to its portfolio. Sun, being an advisor at Donald Trump’s crypto organization and the largest holder of the WLFI token, will likely play a crucial role in the project’s TRX investment strategy.

Though it is unclear how much TRX the entity would purchase, it is estimated that a significant portion of its profits would be used for the investment. Since its launch in September, Trump’s crypto organization has spent about $12 million to buy assets like Ethereum (ETH), Aave, and Chainlink (LINK). Further, it’s worth mentioning that the organization has raised almost $90 million by selling its WLFI tokens. Notably, Sun, the single-largest holder of WLFI, acquired tokens worth about $30 million in November.

Meanwhile, the other altcoins continue to soar within a small margin; a couple of them have surged magnificently. Solana’s price surged above $235 in a small timeframe, while Ethereum’s price remains consolidated below $3,300 and the XRP price continues to trade along the gains. On the other hand, newly launched tokens are also making huge noise within the markets, suggesting a massive price action could be on the horizon. In an interesting update, the next President of the U.S., Donald Trump, officially launched a memecoin on Solana, TRUMP. Meanwhile, it was speculated that the account could be compromised but no further update was given even after hours of launch. On the other hand, Solana’s 24-hour DEX trading volume soared to over $7 billion, setting a new all-time high. Meanwhile, TRUMP smashed a $15 billion market cap in just 4 hours, which hints towards huge liquidity sitting on the sidelines ready to be deployed. Therefore, in the coming weeks, this is expected to enter other popular tokens too. Currently, the token has absorbed all the liquidity, which is not believed to prevail for long. Does this hint have to be a good time to accumulate altcoins? Since the launch of TRUMP, the prices have surged along with the SOL price, but the other popular altcoins like BTC, ETH, XRP, and other major tokens have plunged. This could suggest the traders selling their long-term holdings to buy TRUMP. Will this end up being good for the market participants? The TRUMP price has surged by over 120% and entered the top 50 cryptos with a market cap of around $2.86 billion. While the memecoin space was mocked by many as it lacked fundamentals, now it has been validated by one of the most popular men. Besides, it is also a testament to the unstoppable power of memes and community-driven assets in Web 3. While some believed it to be a short-term rally, some consider there is yet more incoming. Therefore, the upcoming weekend could be important to determine the liquidity flow within the markets.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-18 07:43:34

The idea is to consider Layer 2 rollups as enterprises built in cities within the “Ethereum mainnet” state. The controversy surrounding Soneium was the steps taken to safeguard intellectual property by placing restrictions on some contracts within the protocol.

Their mission is nothing short of revolutionary. They want to enshrine Bitcoin’s place in the Swiss Constitution and, in the process, make history. Under Switzerland’s system of direct democracy, these guys have already started gathering the 100,000 signatures they need to force a national vote. If successful, the country’s 8.8 million people will decide whether Bitcoin deserves a seat at the table of one of the world’s most respected central banks. A fight over money in a crypto-friendly country This comes at a time when Switzerland is already ahead of most nations in adopting cryptocurrencies. The country has 11% of its population holding digital assets, according to a 2024 report by Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts. Bitcoin ATMs are as common as bakeries in many small towns, and since 2016, residents have been able to buy Bitcoin directly from train station ticket machines. Lugano, a city in the country, even allows citizens to pay taxes, fines, and other bills with Bitcoin. It’s now become something of a vacation spot for crypto elites. Yves Bennaim, chair of the campaigners committee, insists that Bitcoin could protect Swiss reserves from the influence of foreign powers. “Most of the SNB’s reserves are in euros and dollars,” he explained. “That makes us dependent on the policies of other countries. Bitcoin offers us a way out.” Switzerland’s love of financial privacy could also work in the campaign’s favor. There are parallels between Bitcoin’s decentralization and the country’s tradition of sovereignty. The global winds of change All of this come at a time when the whole world seems to be changing its opinion on Bitcoin. US President Donald Trump has backed the idea of a national Bitcoin reserve, proudly calling himself ‘the crypto president.’ Christian Lindner, Germany’s former finance minister, suggested that the European Central Bank consider holding Bitcoin in December. But Switzerland is miles ahead of these countries. In August 2019, the country became the first ever to issue licenses to crypto banks, and state-owned PostFinance AG began offering crypto services. UBS economist Alessandro Bee cautioned against Bitcoin’s infamous volatility. “If the SNB invests in Bitcoin, there’s a real risk its equity could shrink during market downturns. Over time, this could hurt the bank’s credibility,” he said. Critics argue that the SNB’s credibility, built on its cautious approach, could take a hit if it embraced an asset as unpredictable as Bitcoin. Claude Maurer, chief economist at BAK Economics, believes the public’s trust in the SNB is too high for a campaign like this to succeed. Whether or not the vote succeeds, the campaign is forcing Switzerland to confront its relationship with money in a way it hasn’t in decades. With the clock ticking toward the June 2026 deadline for signature collection, the organizers are betting that Bitcoin’s growing acceptance, both at home and abroad, will push the Swiss public to embrace this digital revolution.

While major accounts and news sources have indicated the possibility of it being real, it has not been verified through official channels. Trump’s own social media posts have created doubts, with some suggesting that these posts could be the result of hacking. Anthony Pompliano wrote on X, “The incoming President of the United States just launched a meme coin days before his inauguration. The market cap is almost $8 billion in less than 3 hours, which nearly doubles Trump’s net worth. Financial markets are not ready for what is ahead — buckle up.” However, Crypto commentator JRNY Crypto expressed doubt. He wrote, “Bro if this $TRUMP coin is real, wtf are his advisors doing. No video, no confirmation or proof it’s real, just a social media post.” The excitement surrounding this development has created a stir in the market, especially as the inauguration day draws near. This launch has also triggered a wider debate in the crypto community. Supporters argue that this could be a sign of a new era for cryptocurrency, with Trump’s involvement signaling mainstream acceptance. On the other hand, critics warn that the launch of a meme coin by a sitting president may be a risky move, questioning its impact on the legitimacy of cryptocurrencies.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-18 07:50:48

Why PEPETO, DOGE, and BONK Are the Tokens to Buy appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency market remains a treasure trove for clever investors who diversify portfolios. Thousands of tokens exist, and the focus is on projects with strong basics, community involvement, and growth chances. PEPETO , DOGE and BONK are top choices for 2025 ‒ attracting different market segments. This article reviews these three tokens and shows why PEPETO offers a very attractive investment chance in its presale phase. Understanding the Tokens PEPETO is a special cryptocurrency. It mixes memecoin culture with a strong, utility-focused system. PEPETO focuses on long-term worth with features like staking rewards, zero-fee exchange, plus a cross-chain bridge for working together.

With famous Shiba Inu branding and strong community support, DOGE has been popular in crypto since its 2013 inception. DOGE’s main attraction lies in its meme value plus community projects but faces criticism for lacking precise use beyond speculation. Despite this issue, its reputation and large market cap make it popular among retail investors. BONK ‒ a different memecoin ‒ is gaining attention as a community-focused project with the fresh energy of cryptocurrency’s playful spirit next to it all through! Using its lively community vibe, BONK positions itself for those seeking quick gains within an unpredictable environment; however ‒ as many other memecoins ‒ it has uncertain sustainability and long-term potential due to limited uses and reliance on market feelings, mainly driving things forward here too! Why PEPETO Excels PEPETO differs from DOGE plus BONK. It is not only a memecoin but a complete project. It serves speculative traders along with long-term investors. The ecosystem provides meaningful utility by tackling common crypto issues like high transaction fees next to interoperability barriers. PEPETO’s staking program shines brightly. Investors gain passive income while supporting the network. This feature aligns with the token’s goal of promoting long-term holding ‒ reducing price volatility associated with memecoins. Its zero-fee exchange enables seamless plus cost-effective transactions ‒ setting it apart in a crowded marketplace. PEPETO plans to launch a zero-fee exchange, along with strategic marketing moves ‒ this sets it up for tremendous growth. Early adopters might see significant returns as the token gains momentum and broaden adoption. Conclusion DOGE plus BONK offer quick profit chances but lacks long-term worth and usefulness. PEPETO delivers these benefits. Its fresh ecosystem, strong presale results, plus dedication to tackling major crypto issues make it a standout option for investors. As the crypto market changes, PEPETO’s mix of memecoin charm and real-world use helps it thrive. To join the current presale or start staking PEPETO ‒ visit PEPETO’s official site. ABOUT PEPETO Pepeto is a daring cryptocurrency project combining the fun of memecoins with a powerful utility-driven system. It has a zero-fee exchange ‒ a cross-chain bridge for easy swaps ‒ plus staking rewards to support new tokens.

XRP News: Expert Reveals SOL, LTC, & XRP ETF Filings Amid Others According to an X post by Nate Geraci on January 18, the crypto sector has witnessed seven filings for digital asset-backed ETFs in the past 48 hours. Notably, filings for XRP, SOL, and LTC ETFs, among others, have primarily stolen the spotlight. As per Geraci, filings for ProShares Leveraged & Inverse XRP ETFs, ProShares XRP Futures ETF, ProShares Solana Futures ETF, and Canary Litecoin ETF (19b-4) have been submitted recently. Further, other filings include VanEck Onchain Economy ETF, Oasis Capital Digital Asset Debt Strategy ETF, and CoinShares Digital Asset ETF. Altogether, these filings ride an optimistic wave as pro-crypto Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration is set for January 20. Gary Gensler’s Farewell Boosts Market Sentiment For ETFs Also, it’s worth mentioning that with Gary Gensler concluding his term as the U.S. SEC Chair on Friday, market sentiments over regulatory uncertainties in the crypto realm have taken a paradigm shift. In the wake of Gensler’s resignation, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty has also conveyed immense optimism, emerging as bullish XRP news for the whole community. Meanwhile, it’s noteworthy that Nate Geraci previously predicted that an XRP and Solana ETF would be approved this year as regulatory winds shift. Particularly in the wake of the new U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins, who was appointed under Trump’s presidency, crypto market participants remain upbeat. Further, JPMorgan analysts remained positive over ETF launches ahead, predicting SOL and XRP-backed products to bring an inflow of approximately $15 billion within a year. Overall, the filings amid these broader developments have gained significant traction across the industry, How Are The Crypto Performing? Simultaneously, it’s worth pointing out that XRP price exchanged hands at $3.15, down 5% from yesterday. Its 24-hour bottom and high were $3.09 and $3.34, respectively. On the other hand, SOL price witnessed an 11% uptick to reach $236.41. Its intraday low and high were $212.44 and $237.66, respectively. Given that the XRP and Solana ETF filings could get approved ahead, market watchers remain highly bullish on future price movements. Also, traders and investors are currently rejoicing that pro-crypto Trump is set to take office shortly, which is another bullish news for XRP, SOL, LTC, and other cryptocurrencies.

According to data from CoinMarketCap, Ethereum gained by 7.25% spurring a return to the $3,500 price zone. Interestingly, more market developments are pointing to a long-term bullish future for the altcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Is Forming A 1-Hour Symmetrical Triangle – Bullish Breakout Or Deeper Correction? Ethereum Merge Sparks Mega Increase In Whale Holdings In a recent X post by crypto analytics firm IntoTheBlock, the Ethereum network has recorded a massive rise in whales’ reserves over the past two years. Generally, whales are wallet addresses that hold a substantial amount of a token, typically over 10,000 ETH for the Ethereum network. Whales are important due to their large holdings which could allow them to influence market trends. According to IntoTheBlock, the Ethereum whales‘ balance has surged from 22% of the coin’s supply in early 2023 to a current value of 43%, indicating about a 100% gain in 24 months. So far, the blockchain analytics firm has linked this accumulation spree to the Ethereum Merge that occurred in September 2022. For context, the Merge, considered a historic event, allowed the Ethereum mainnet to integrate with the Beacon Chain transforming it into a fully functional proof-of-stake blockchain. The Merge offers many benefits in terms of potential for sharding to ease network traffic, environmental friendliness, and importantly staking, as it allowed long-term Ethereum investors to finally withdraw their staked rewards. IntoTheBlock postulated that in particular, whales found this upgraded staking feature attractive resulting in the accumulation surge since 2023. In backing this notion, data from beaconcha.in shows that staked ETH has grown from 15,804,310 ETH in January 2023 to 33,898,981 ETH in January 2025 indicating a 114.49% gain in the same period during which a surge in whale accumulation has occurred. In terms of their ability to influence market trends, whale transactions are viewed as trading signals by smaller, retail investors. Thus, a strong accumulation pattern by ETH whales, as currently reported, is a robust bullish signal supporting the altcoin’s long-term profitability.

If it surpasses this, it may rise further to around $4,000. With a market cap of $422.34 billion, Ethereum remains the second-largest cryptocurrency and altcoin in the world.

The charges, announced on January 17, culminated in a settlement of $38.5 million in civil penalties. DCG is responsible for the lion’s share, agreeing to pay $38 million, while Moro faces a $500,000 fine. Notably, both parties settled without admitting to or denying violations of the Securities Act of 1933, marking a critical chapter in the unraveling of the 3AC saga that shook the crypto world to its core. Genesis Bankruptcy Genesis filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January 2023, tracing its financial woes back to 3AC’s disastrous collapse. The hedge fund’s failure stemmed from its ill-fated $570 million purchase of locked LUNA tokens—a position that was nearly obliterated following the Terra ecosystem’s implosion in May 2022. When 3AC defaulted on its loans in June 2022, the fallout was swift. Unable to meet margin calls, the hedge fund faced court-ordered liquidation in the British Virgin Islands on June 27, 2022, the same day Voyager Digital declared 3AC in default over unpaid debts totaling 15,250 Bitcoin. In the midst of this chaos, then-Genesis CEO Moro issued reassurances to investors, claiming that DCG and Genesis had taken steps to “mitigate losses” linked to 3AC’s default. However, the SEC’s investigation revealed discrepancies between these public statements and the actual financial health of the companies. The Ripple Effects The collapse of 3AC had far-reaching implications, impacting multiple firms with exposure to the hedge fund’s risky positions. Genesis, a major crypto lender, was one of the hardest hit, with its bankruptcy marking a significant blow to DCG’s reputation. The SEC’s charges underscore the agency’s intent to hold key players accountable in a market still reeling from 2022’s high-profile failures. While DCG and Moro’s settlement closes one chapter, it serves as a stark reminder of the lasting consequences of misinformation in the volatile crypto sector.

This lackluster performance from ETH has been a theme throughout 2024 and has not changed so far in 2025. This situation exacerbated after a new Solana meme coin announced on President-elect Donald Trump’s X page has outperformed Ethereum’s 4-year gains in just 90 minutes.

TRUMP Coin Outperforms Ethereum’s 4-Year Gains in 90 Minutes The TRUMP coin soared by 766% in just 1 hour and 31 minutes today, as seen below. Since its inception, the token has raked 8,110% and continues to rally higher. Ethereum, on the other hand, has managed to shoot up 420% in the last four years. While some speculate that this could be the work of scammers who took control of Trump’s X account, others believe it is a promotion from the to-be 47th president of the United States of America. So far, no official comments have been made from Trump or his team. Still, many suggest TRUMP Solana meme coin was launched by Donald Trump . TRUMP/USDT 1-minute chart Whales Buy 330,000 ETH Last Week According to Santimen, Ethereum whales holding between 1,000 to 10,000 ETH have scooped up 330,000 tokens in the past week. At present, the value of these tokens is roughly $1 billion. Despite this buying spree, the price of ETH continues to linger at around $3,300, with no signs of a breakout rally. ETH Whales Accumulate Roughly $1 Billion Tokens On-chain metrics showcase a bullish outlook. Supporting it is the technical analysis of ETH, which also shows a similar scenario with a massive bottom reversal pattern forming on the weekly chart. Ethereum Price Analysis Ethereum price’s weekly chart shows a cup and handle setup, which is a bullish reversal pattern. This technical formation forecasts a 72% rally to $6,172, obtained by adding the cup’s depth to the neckline at $4,000. However, for a decisive breakout, Ethereum price needs to overcome the $3,800 to $4,100 resistance zone. A weekly candlestick close above this zone that flips it into a support level will confirm a resolution of the cup and handle setup. In such a case, Ethereum price forecasts the next target at $6,000. Cup and handle pattern observed on ETH/USDT 1-week chart While Ethereum price performance has been lackluster, it hasn’t crashed and is holding its ground, showing resilience. On the other hand, many altcoins continue to crash with no bottom in sight. Investors should disregard the short-term noise and pay attention to the long-term outlook, which is promising, considering the crypto bull market has a long way to go before it tops. The growing fundamentals and on-chain metrics add credence to a better performance in the near future.

The analyst and trader pseudonymously known as Bluntz tells his 309,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin has witnessed “savage price action” after falling to around $89,200 and then quickly recovering. According to the analyst, Bitcoin is primed to rally by at least 17% from the current level. “Take the lows, make everyone capitulate and then up only with no dips forcing sidelined traders and investors to chase price higher. This next leg up should be the one that takes us to $120,000+ in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X Based on a chart by the pseudonymous analyst who regularly applies the Elliott Wave theory in his technical analysis, Bitcoin is in the last part of a five-wave pattern that started in September of 2024. The Elliott Wave theory states that the main trend of the price of an asset moves in a five-wave pattern while a correction occurs in a three-wave pattern. Bitcoin is trading at $102,580 at time of writing. The analyst also offers his take on the memecoin FLOKI ( FLOKI ). According to Bluntz, FLOKI is forming a double-bottom pattern on the three-day time frame. A double-bottom pattern is typically considered a bullish reversal pattern.

How High Can It Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The memecoin market has experienced a strong bullish reversal as Bitcoin price today successfully holds its value above the $100k mark. While top meme coins like DOGE price and SHIB price experience stable growth, the Bonk memecoin has recorded double-digit growth. Considering the present market sentiments, will this Solana-based crypto outrun the Dogecoin price during the coming altcoin season? CoinPedia’s expert panel has uncovered the possible short-term market sentiments, price analysis, and possible price targets of the Bonk (BONK) memecoin. Bonk Memecoin Retests Its Important Resistance Level! The Bonk price has jumped 11.83% in 24 hours with a trading volume of $602.84 million, a change of +171.82%. Moreover, with a weekly surge of ~16%, this memecoin has successfully reclaimed the $0.000030 mark, highlighting increased positive influence. Bonk Price Analysis 18-01-2025 Moreover, this altcoin has soared ~7% in the last 30 days and has a Year-to-Date (YTD) return of 5.66%. With a market capitalization of $2.467 billion, the BONK meme coin has secured the 51st position in the global crypto market list. Bonk Technical Sentiments The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) displays a constant rise in the green histogram with its averages recording a bullish convergence in the daily time frame. This suggests a positive outlook for the 03rd largest meme coin in the market. On the other hand, the SMA indicator constantly supports the Bonk price chart in the 1D time frame. This suggests that this memecoin could continue gaining value during the coming week. Will BONK Price Hit $0.000050 This Month? If the bullish sentiment is sustained, the Bonk coin price will reclaim its resistance of $0.00003390. Maintaining the price at that level could set the stage for it to head toward its upper resistance level of $0.00004050 this month. Conversely, a bearish reversal could pull the price toward its support level of $0.000030. Furthermore, if the bearish sentiment intensifies at that point, it could plunge toward its low of $0.0000270. Wondering about the long-term price prospects of this memecoin?

Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPAI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) could become the next viral memecoin. Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump AI Coin (TRUMPAI) by entering its contract address – GmW5qPRZ4TfoTw6U1KL9Btxn1uqXJJhieMAfeJk4wkbg – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPAI.

And this time, meme coins seem to be leading the charge in a bullish rally. Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Yeti Ouro (YETIO) are grabbing headlines as investors rally to find the next big meme coin. Let us see why these meme coins have been the talk of the town. Shiba Inu Coin Price Prediction: Can SHIB Target A 50% Gain? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has rebounded strongly after a brief price dip, SHIB price gaining 8.29% in the past 24 hours to reach $0.000024 . SHIB’s price action and metrics signal bullish momentum, with analysts predicting a potential 50% rally in the coming weeks. There has been a notable increase in Shiba Inu whale activity. Even when SHIB dipped a little, the activity was over 2000%, involving nearly $750M in SHIB tokens. Whale activity is known to significantly influence price movement. There has also been an increase of 85.33% in the volume in the last 24 hours. Dogecoin Price Prediction: DOGE To The Moon? Whale Alert revealed that over 400 million DOGE, worth $154 million, were transferred between unknown wallets on Friday, indicating large-scale accumulation. Earlier in the week, whales had already purchased 470 million DOGE within 48 hours, reinforcing expectations of a major breakout. Analysts are predicting a 2021-style rally for DOGE after seeing the recent surge in whale activity. Adding fuel to the fire are rumors of Tesla accepting DOGE as payment and its potential integration into Elon Musk’s X Money platform. Rumors surrounding these updates, along with optimism for a more crypto-friendly regulatory landscape under the Trump administration, are boosting market confidence. Current DOGE price is $0.417081 with an increase of 8.81% in the last 24 hours. YETIO’s Successful Presale While legendary meme coins like SHIB and DOGE make the big headlines, YETIO is positioning itself as the next big thing in the meme coin world. YETIO’s ongoing presale has been successful so far. YETIO surpasses the typical meme coin hype by combining community-driven momentum with real-world utility. YETIO integrates real-world utility through its Play-to-Earn gaming platform, Yeti Go. The team shared a video showcasing the first glance at the Level 1 map at a distance. This is a larger area of the map that uses the same deathmatch style game play. Players have a large surface area to avoid attackers and collect power-ups to help them defeat opponents. There is so much detail yet to be shown, with garages for vehicle repairs and upgrades as well as hidden tunnels and harsh terrains to get through. Conclusion The crypto market is set for another significant bull run and meme coins continue to make the most waves.

Gensler has been active in the crypto industry, especially for its legal connection with the Ripple token through the SEC Vs Ripple case. With his resignation, investors anticipate a significant change in the XRP price performance, especially with the political and regulatory shift with soon-to-be 47th US President Donald Trump. Gary Gensler Farewell Speech & What To Expect? Gensler is the 33rd chairman of the US SEC. He began his tenure on April 17, 2021, and announced his resignation soon after Donald Trump’s win in the US election. Gensler will step down from the position on January 20 at 12:00 p.m. Notably, Trump has picked Paul Atkins as the SEC Chair candidate, but the senators voting will decide. Subject to sharing their public remarks, the Gary Gensler farewell speech might happen before the resignation. Interestingly, even before this, Gensler thanked his peers and colleagues open-heartedly. To many, it already felt like a farewell speech. He recently shared a long thread post highlighting some SEC achievements under his guidance , such as taking on 2700 cases, returning $2.7B to the public, completing 46 rule finalizations, and much more. I deeply believe in capital mkts, competition, & common-sense rules of the road that benefit investors & issuers alike. That’s why our staff & this agency play a critical role in overseeing the mkts & ensuring for compliance w/ US securities laws’ common-sense rules of the road. The Farewell speech will present a similar discussion covering Gar Gensler’s journey. Experts believe he might again share his views on XRP and attribute it to Security. Is Gensler’s Resignation The Push XRP Needs? Ripple faced a massive downtrend with the SEC’s allegation that XRP is a security and has failed on many regulatory measures. At prime, this token value was $3.8 but declined to an average price of $0.5 under the constant SEC vs. Ripple battle, in which Gary Gnesler had a significant role. Surprisingly, things changed with Trump’s win in the US election, as the XRP price hit a 7-year high at $3.38. More importantly, the nearing Trump’s inauguration and Gary Gensler’s resignation significantly boosted investor sentiments. This recovery and investors’ hate with the current SEC Chair hints at the better performance of the Ripple token in Gensler’s absence. Today marks Gensler’s last full day. Starting tomorrow, ‘Gary who?’ will be the only appropriate response if someone mentions his name. Onward, says Stuart Alderoty, Ripple Chief Legal Officer. Moreover, Paul Atkins is in discussion for the SEC Chairman position, rising investor demand for better regulations. Next is the Ripple ETF approval , whose odds have increased to 66% on Polymarket. As JPMorgan added, the XRP ETF would bring around $4-$8M in inflows in the first year, price will likely boom. XRP Price Targets $20, But With Consolidations Due to his strict regulatory stance on the crypto market, crypto enthusiasts and XRP holders have waited for Gary Gensler’s resignation for years. Ever since the announcement in November 2024, the XRP price has constantly moved upward with investors’ enthusiasm. This week, the Ripple token created a seven-year high before consolidating significantly today. At present, XRP trades at $3.15 after a 6% price consolidation. This happened as the investor’s activity decreased with mixed sentiments in the market. However, in the broader market, the bullish trend is still visible. Crypto analyst Andrew Griffiths’s Ripple prediction hints at the formation of consolidation, with the $2.80-$2.90 area being a potential trend reversal zone. According to him, Wave 3 (from Elliot’s wave theory) is near completion, with Wave 4 bringing the corrective phase. However, Griffith advises investors to wait on the market, as Wave 5 can resume the bullish trend, pushing the Ripple price back to $3.30. In the long term, the XRP price might hit $20 with Ripple ETF approval and support of bullish factors. Will XRP Price Hike With Gary Gensler Farewell? Under the current conditions, the Ripple token will likely rise with Gary Gensler’s farewell speech. However, the outcome will mainly depend on investors’ sentiments. If the selling activity increases, random declines may happen. Market uncertainty is high during such macroeconomic events, especially as analysts’ earlier prediction shows Bitcoin price consolidation near Donald Trump’s inauguration. Regardless, the bullish outlook is consistent for the long-term phase, where the XRP can surge to $20 with Donald Trump’s presidency, ETF approval, and regulatory certainty.

The move comes as Donald Trump launched TRUMP meme coin on Solana, taking the liquidity from other tokens in the crypto market today. Binance Halts Solana (SOL) Withdrawals Temporarily Binance’s customer support on X said that the platform was replenishing the hot wallet for SOL withdrawal through the BSC Network. The incident came to light after a Binance user posted their question on X, asking the platform why it was not allowing SOL withdrawals. Source: Binance SOL withdrawals in high volume could be a culmination of enthusiasm around the meme coin and a surge of 11.23% in its token value over the past 24 hours. An increased enthusiasm around SOL is likely the result of the launch of TRUMP meme coin which is now live on Solana. It can be bought using a debit card or a cryptocurrency. Meanwhile, Binance has asked users to register to receive notifications when SOL withdrawals resume. The platform has not given a timeline but the withdrawal function should resume soon. SOL price is now at $236.38, which also reflects an uptick of 26.90% in the last 7 days and an increase of 12.39% in the last 1 month.

While PEPE stands out among meme coins for its explosive rallies, FXGuys is emerging as a DeFi coin with real utility and income opportunities. FXGuys offers unique features that appeal to investors seeking long-term gains. Users can stake $FXG tokens to earn passive income and participate in a revenue-sharing program from broker trading activities. Its Trader Funding Program, which provides accounts up to $500,000 without KYC checks, has gained widespread attention. Could FXGuys be the top choice for traders aiming to maximize gains in 2025? Read on to find out! >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE PEPE’s Volatile Ride: Whale Activity Sparks Interest and Concern Around Meme Coins Pepe whales are making big moves with the frog-themed meme coin . They buy huge amounts of PEPE, and some even withdraw their tokens from exchanges. This has led many to wonder if PEPE is the best crypto to buy right now. Two massive transactions have stood out. One investor withdrew 280 billion PEPE tokens from Binance, worth about $5 million. Another spent 3.72 million USDC to grab 200.4 billion tokens. In the past week, the value of PEPE dropped recently. The coin declined by 2.08% from last week to trade at $0.0000175. Moving forward, some experts anticipate an uptrend for meme coins like PEPE due to recent whale activity. Thus, PEPE’s price could rise to $0.0000270 in a few weeks. On the flip side, investors are wary about investing in PEPE, as its RSI is pointing to a potential downtrend. Hence, PEPE could drop to $0.0000140. This bearish forecast is pushing PEPE enthusiasts towards FX Guys, which they say is a better project with strong utility. Binance’s Partnership With Circle Triggers Bullish Forecasts For the BNB DeFi Coin Binance recently partnered with Circle to challenge Tether’s dominance in the market. Circle’s stablecoin $USDC will be integrated into Binance’s ecosystem. This partnership is expected to bring a lot of new liquidity to Binance’s ecosystem. It could also help BNB’s price reach $700 again soon. Some DeFi coin experts think this partnership will make the first quarter of 2025 very positive for BNB. If you’re looking at DeFi coin prices and wondering which one might have the most potential, BNB is a name that would pop up. Meanwhile, its value has increased slightly recently. BNB is currently valued at $698.62 , a marginal 0.44% decline from last week. Concerning price predictions, some experts are skeptical about investing in BNB due to the decline in its trading volume. They fear that this could cause its value to drop to $620 soon. Amid this price uncertainty, experts expect DeFi coins like the $FXG token to overtake BNB. This is primarily due to the FX Guys platform’s staking rewards program, which gives users passive income for holding the tokens. Why FXGuys Leads the Way in the Crypto Trading and DeFi Arena FXGuys is gaining traction as a top contender for crypto trading gains in 2025. The platform allows users to stake $FXG tokens and earn impressive returns. It also offers revenue-sharing opportunities from its broker trading activities, adding value to its growing use cases. Investors are drawn to the FX Guys platform because it offers extra income opportunities. Through its Trade2Earn program, traders earn $FXG tokens for each trade, regardless of profit or loss. This feature rewards trading activity and builds engagement on the platform. The FXGuys platform has removed all buy and sell taxes for $FXG transactions, making it more appealing. By cutting out transaction fees, traders can keep more of their earnings. Additionally, the Trader Funding Program is gaining popularity, offering funded accounts of up to $500,000 to traders worldwide. Another standout feature is the ability to participate in trading challenges without KYC requirements. Traders can win funded accounts based on their performance and keep up to 80% of the profits. This has sparked interest among crypto trading experts and global investors looking for flexibility and opportunities in the DeFi token market. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE Experts Share Insights on Why $FXG is the Best Crypto to Buy $FXG is in Stage 2 of its public presale, with each token priced at $0.04. Over 250 million tokens have already been sold. This shows growing trust from investors who see potential in the coin. Analysts predict a launch price of $0.10 for $FXG , which could mean a 150% return on investment for Stage 2 investors. Some even suggest the DeFi coin price might skyrocket 100 times its current value after launch. These projections make $FXG stand out as a promising choice. PEPE and BNB also show strong market presence, but $FXG’s unique momentum has many keeping a close eye. Is this the next big thing in crypto, or just another risk? $FXG’s potential rewards outweigh the uncertainties of the market, so why not dive in?

Starting the year at $2 , the steady climb of XRP’s DeFi coin price to $3 has sparked optimism. Experts believe this price movement reflects XRP’s growing potential within the market. A crypto analyst, Egragcrypto, recently highlighted XRP’s rare “Megaphone Pattern.” This formation, characterized by higher highs and lower lows, has a success rate exceeding 70%. According to Egragcrypto , the pattern suggests that XRP is on track for a significant breakout. Many view this as a key indicator behind the $120 price prediction for XRP, cementing its position as a major force. The Megaphone Pattern outlines a future where Ripple achieves double-digit prices. Analysts believe that XRP’s DeFi coin price current movement signals long-term growth, with a realistic path to the $120 mark. As Ripple attracts more institutional interest, this ambitious price prediction for XRP seems increasingly attainable. Timing the market and observing sustained volume remain critical for validating this bullish outlook. While XRP’s surge dominates headlines, another DeFi player, FXGuys, is gaining traction.

Accompanying his commentary was a long-term chart that has garnered significant attention in the cryptocurrency community. Carlasare stated, “It’s hard to say this long-term chart of XRP/BTC is bearish. You can make an argument for [an] all-time high against BTC.” This statement highlights a shift in sentiment for XRP’s performance relative to Bitcoin. While Bitcoin bulls often dominate the discourse, the shared chart reveals structural strength in XRP’s long-term pairing with Bitcoin. It reflects a potential breakout scenario, especially with XRP’s exceptional performance over the past few months. I’m a bitcoin bull, but it’s hard to say this long term chart of XRPBTC is bearish. You can make an argument for all time high against btc It is what it is. pic.twitter.com/hzOjfVPbMb — Joe Carlasare (@JoeCarlasare) January 16, 2025 Bullish Outlook For XRP The XRP/BTC pair has seen notable developments recently. After years of declining performance, the pair has reversed its downtrend, showing a significant rally this month. It started the year at 0.000022 BTC and has risen significantly over the past few weeks, currently at 0.00003132 BTC, after reaching a multi-year high of $0.00003309. Notably, a well-respected analyst recently showed that XRP has kept parity with Bitcoin. At the start of the year, 1 BTC could buy 43,000 XRP, the same amount of XRP as in 2014. Although XRP’s price seemed to lag behind Bitcoin at certain points in its history, it always caught up. With XRP’s recent rise, 1 BTC now buys about 33,300 XRP. This could further decline as XRP’s price rises. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Analysts Predict Higher Targets Alongside Carlasare’s observation, other prominent analysts have echoed bullish projections for XRP. One analyst recently predicted a rally to $4 for XRP, contingent on the XRP/BTC pair clearing a crucial technical level. XRP has cleared this level and sustained the bullish momentum. The asset is trading at $3.28 and is making a run for the $4 target. If it continues climbing, it could surpass $4 and reach $8 in the short term, more than double its current all-time high of $3.84. EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), another well-respected analyst, anticipates an even more aggressive target of $13 to $15 by March 10 , provided XRP surpasses the key resistance level at $4. These predictions align with the chart’s signals, reinforcing expectations for a continuation of the uptrend. Historical patterns in the XRP/BTC pair suggest that XRP breaking major resistance levels can lead to sustained price increases over time.

This article highlights five digital coins priced under five cents that could experience significant growth. Uncover these hidden gems that have the potential to transform a modest investment into a substantial gain in the coming years. From sports fans to crypto champions: Inside the XYZVerse movement In sports, greatness transcends limits. Athletes embody resilience, determination, and the relentless pursuit of success. The same spirit fuels the crypto world — and it’s the driving force behind XYZVerse , a game-changing meme coin project that combines the electrifying energy of sports with the playful charm of memes. XYZVerse is where football fanatics, basketball devotees, MMA enthusiasts, and esports grinders come together as crypto warriors on a mission for massive rewards. Unbeatable early-stage opportunity Launched at just $0.0001, the XYZ token has already skyrocketed to Stage 10 of its presale, now priced at $0.002. With a listing target of $0.10, early investors have secured discounts of up to 99%, making this a rare opportunity to get in ahead of the game. Built for the long haul: Solid tokenomics and deflationary strategy XYZVerse is more than a quick profit scheme; it’s a project built for lasting success. The tokenomics are carefully structured, with 15% allocated to liquidity and 10% for community rewards like bonuses and airdrops, fostering a strong and loyal ecosystem. A planned deflationary burn of 17.13% of tokens will further reduce supply, creating scarcity and boosting long-term value. Bridging sports and crypto with star power With a focus on mass adoption, XYZVerse plans to collaborate with top sports personalities, building bridges between traditional sports fans and the crypto world. These partnerships will amplify the project’s reach, merging entertainment and finance into a seamless experience. With an unstoppable vision and a thriving community, XYZVerse is redefining the meme coin universe — one milestone at a time. You might also like: Why analysts are choosing XYZVerse instead of PEPE and SHIB BONK: The Shiba Inu meme coin taking the Solana community by storm BONK, a meme coin built on the Solana blockchain with a charming Shiba Inu mascot, is capturing the attention of crypto enthusiasts. Aimed at empowering the Solana community, BONK sets itself apart by redistributing power from traditional venture capital tokens back to the users. Following its surge of over 100% after a listing on Coinbase, BONK has solidified its status as a “community coin.” Impressively, it airdropped 50% of its total supply to participants in Solana’s NFT and DeFi spaces, which has spurred widespread adoption and engagement. By mid-December 2023, BONK had climbed to become the third-largest memecoin by market capitalization and emerged as one of the year’s top gainers with an astounding year-to-date increase of over 10,000%. While BONK’s rapid growth and deep integration into the Solana ecosystem are promising, it faces challenges typical of memecoins, such as high total supply and market volatility. Nevertheless, its involvement in an expanding array of decentralized applications, including the launch of its own decentralized exchange called BonkSwap, positions it as a noteworthy contender in the crypto space. Compared to other meme coins, BONK’s active development and utility within a fast-growing blockchain ecosystem make it particularly intriguing in the current market cycle. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, BONK’s community-driven approach and technological advancements could offer it a competitive edge. Prospective buyers should, however, conduct thorough research and remain mindful of the inherent risks associated with trading meme coins. Shiba Inu: The meme token with big ambitions Shiba Inu , or SHIB, began as a playful nod to Dogecoin but has quickly made a name for itself. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous Ryoshi, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, joining one of the largest crypto ecosystems. From an initial supply of one quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. His donation to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the “burning” of 40% of SHIB’s supply boosted the token’s global profile. What sets SHIB apart is its Ethereum integration, allowing for more than meme status. The creation of ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, shows SHIB’s move towards real utility. Plans for an NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system point to a roadmap for growth. In today’s market, where utility and community matter, SHIB’s place in Ethereum’s ecosystem could make it appealing to those interested in emerging crypto projects. Compared to other meme coins, SHIB’s technological goals and active development might give it an edge in the evolving crypto space. PEPE coin: From internet meme to crypto sensation PEPE Coin is the latest buzz in the crypto world. Inspired by Matt Furie’s iconic Pepe the Frog meme from the early 2000s, this deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum has captured the imagination of investors and meme enthusiasts alike. By adopting a no-tax policy and embracing its identity purely as a meme coin without pretense of utility, PEPE aligns itself with other popular meme-based cryptocurrencies like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. In late April to May 2023, PEPE experienced an explosive surge, with its market cap soaring to $1.6 billion. Early holders saw remarkable gains, and the coin’s rise contributed to what some call a “meme coin season,” where newly launched tokens experienced rapid pumps and dumps. PEPE’s potential lies in its strong community and viral momentum. Its roadmap outlines goals like getting listed on major exchanges and aiming for a “meme takeover.” In the current market cycle, the rise of PEPE reflects a growing interest in meme coins within the broader cryptocurrency landscape. While some are drawn to its simplicity and cultural resonance, others remain cautious due to its lack of inherent utility. As the crypto community looks ahead to the upcoming Bitcoin halving and speculates about a Bull Run, PEPE stands as a testament to the unpredictable and dynamic nature of crypto trends. Turbo Token: The AI-crafted meme coin shaking up crypto Turbo Token is the first meme coin born entirely from artificial intelligence. In a bold experiment, its founder asked GPT-4 to create the next great meme coin. The result is Turbo—a coin made by AI for the people. It combines the viral charm of memes with the cutting-edge capabilities of AI, offering something fresh in the crowded crypto landscape. Its potential lies in this unique origin. As markets look for innovation, Turbo stands out by showcasing what AI can achieve in cryptocurrency creation. In the current market cycle, where investors seek the next big thing, Turbo’s blend of technology and community appeal makes it an attractive option. Compared to other meme coins that rely solely on hype, Turbo brings a new level of creativity. It could mark the start of more AI-designed tokens in the future, setting a trend that’s worth watching. Conclusion BONK, SHIB, PEPE, and TURBO have promise, but XYZVerse stands out. It unites sports fans in a meme coin aiming for 20,000% growth, blending memes and sports in a community-driven ecosystem. For more information on XYZVerse, visit their website , Telegram , or X .

According to reports, the victim, a 61-year-old accountant, lost about RM460,888 to the bad actors after making a bad investment decision. According to the police report, the Malaysian accountant was enticed by the returns of a Bitcoin investment scheme. Police chief ACP Mohd Sohaimi Ishak of the Seri Alam district revealed that the elderly woman lodged a report at the police station after discovering the scam. In her report, she claimed she was introduced to an investment platform called PFOU. The victim also added that she joined the platform in July 2024 after several advertisements on Facebook convinced her beyond every reasonable doubt. Malaysian accountant loses RM460,888 to scammers According to her report, after she signified interest in joining the investment group, she was sent a link that would lead her to the general group. While she was in the general group, the bad actors deployed several individuals to explain how the investment worked. They gave her the scoops, convincing her further about the platform’s legitimacy. She highlighted that their explanations were mainly about the returns she would get from her investment. The victim, after taking months to deliberate on the investment opportunity, decided to invest in December. According to her, she was nearing retirement, and what better way to tie funds to an investment that would see you recoup massive returns. In her statement, the Malaysian accountant claimed that the scammers directed her to download an application called UVKXE. The application was used to monitor investments and profits in real-time. The Malaysian accountant was asked to make several payments, with her statement detailing that she made three, which totaled RM460,888. The victim made these payments to two different bank accounts, making the payments between December 30 and January 16. After paying, she was able to view her investments and profits from the UVKXE application as the scammers said. She saw her investment and profits of about 1,219,907 in USDT (RM5.5 million). Police promise to apprehend the criminals According to the statement, things started to go south after the Malaysian accountant notified the scammers about her plans to withdraw her profits. She was asked to pay RM550,152 as management fees. Sohaimi said that the victim, realizing she had been scammed, chose not to pay the fee, and subsequently filed a report with the police. According to Sohaimi, the authorities will do everything in their power to apprehend the criminals and make them face the full wrath of the law. The case has also been filed under Section 420 of the Penal Code for cheating. If the criminals are found guilty, they will be sentenced to prison for 10 years, caned, and asked to pay a fine after conviction. The investigation will also include money mule accounts, which translates into a fine of RM 100,000 and imprisonment. “The investigations will also cover the involvement of money mule accounts under Section 424 of the Penal Code, which provides for a maximum fine of RM100,000, imprisonment of up to seven years, or both,” Sohaimi added. Mohd Sohaimi also urged the general public to be alert to the rising trends of fake investment scams . The criminals usually feed on their victims’ ignorance, by promising them very high returns. Once the victims see the returns, they do not bother to do background checks and begin to send funds to the criminals. With crypto gaining mainstream attention, there will be an increase in cases like this, but he urged the public to be cautious and ask experts about these investments before they dabble into it.

According to a Jan. 17 report by the Financial Times, the company has filed confidential documents with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to prepare for an initial public offering (IPO) in New York. They’re targeting a valuation of $5 billion and it could happen as early as the second quarter of this year, according to the report. Why eToro chose New York over London eToro’s largest market is in the UK, but it’s turning its back on London, a market its CEO Yoni Assia says no longer serves the company’s global ambitions. In his own words: “Very few of our global clients would trade UK shares. Something in the US market creates a pool of both deep liquidity and deep awareness for those assets that are trading in the US” Back in 2021, the company tried a $10.4 billion merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), but it ultimately fell apart in 2022. Assia explained the reasoning at the time, saying, “The markets aren’t there.” That SPAC boom, which promised quick and easy access to public markets, had already imploded by then. In 2023, the company raised $250 million in a funding round led by big names like SoftBank and Ion Group. That round valued the company at $3.5 billion. Now with Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, and UBS backing it, eToro is going to Wall Street. An IPO process starts when the company decides it’s time to go public, and it usually comes down to needing money for expansion or giving early stakeholders a way to turn their equity into actual dollars. Once that decision is locked in, the next step is bringing in underwriters (that’s Goldman Sachs and the rest). These banks will figure out the company’s worth, guide the share pricing, and manage how the stock is introduced to the market. Then the company’s financials are picked apart and put under a microscope. Everything—balance sheets, operations, risks—gets thrown into a registration document, typically an S-1 form, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Could Holding New Coin Elluminex Give You 1000% ROI The crypto market has experienced a notable movement as Solana (SOL) rebounds above the $203 mark amid narrowing losses. This rebound is significant for traders as it suggests a possible shift in market sentiment as SOL attempts to recover from its recent downturn. Market pundits will likely view this price movement as a sign of resilience. However, market trends continue to influence its trajectory. Meanwhile, Elluminex aims to be the first comprehensive DeFi hub on the TON blockchain, designed to redefine the DeFi market as we know it. Its state-of-the-art cross-chain protocol unifies isolated blockchains and brings all the best opportunities together in one place. Moreover, users can reap substantial returns from engaging with the platform and its advanced staking and farming model. Elluminex (ELX) To Reinvent The DeFi Landscape Elluminex is leading the crypto presale hype due to its ecosystem’s flagship feature. Through the upcoming innovative Cross-Chain Bridge, Elluminex (ELX) connects isolated blockchains, allowing users to effortlessly swap assets while enjoying high transaction speeds at the lowest possible prices. This has enhanced liquidity as the platform sources liquidity across multiple blockchains, resulting in low slippage, even in high-volume situations. Its intuitive and lean interface will ensure trading is seamless and stress-free. To reduce barriers to entry and improve privacy, Elluminex has eliminated KYC verification requirements. Users will only need to connect their self-custodial wallets to get started. But that’s not all. Thanks to its exclusive Elluminex portfolio tracker, users can keep track of their assets and manage them most effectively. It will allow users to access real-time analytics, keep up with the latest market updates, and make informed decisions based on raw data. Notably, the project’s intriguing premarket feature will grant early access to TON-based tokens before they hit the market. Elluminex understands that the primary reason hindering DeFi adoption is the market’s inherently complex nature. The platform aims to demystify DeFi by fostering an inclusive and educational academy that enables users to understand core concepts and assists them in making informed decisions. Based on these fundamentals, Elluminex could experience widespread adoption that could increase ELX’s valuation exponentially. Solana Bull Flag Signals A Breakout To $300 Solana (SOL) is at a critical point as it tests demand at previous price levels that acted as resistance. Since late November, SOL’s price has declined, dampening the hype surrounding the altcoin. The prolonged downturn has sparked concerns about whether SOL can regain its bullish momentum. Top analyst Jelle indicated that Solana had formed a falling wedge pattern, a classic bullish formation into a zone once a critical resistance level. Notably, Solana’s price has validated this level as support, offering a foundation for a significant rally in the near term. If this support holds, it could fuel a bullish sentiment, positioning the altcoin for another strong run. However, if the price of Solana fails to sustain this level, it could signal a downside trajectory, potentially eroding confidence in its long-term trajectory. SOL coin must maintain a foothold at the $210 level to trigger a rally that could push its value toward the $250 mark. This recovery could allow the altcoin to regain its bullish momentum and steer it to challenge its ATH. While this case appears ambitious, SOL price performance has demonstrated a capacity for rapid upward movement during similar conditions. A stronghold above the $210 level could validate the recovery and attract fresh buying interest, creating a basis for the next leg of its rally. Can Elluminex Mirror SOL’s Bullish Performance? With bullish momentum on the horizon, the coming days will be critical in determining whether the SOL price will make history and aim for unprecedented price levels. Meanwhile, Elluminex features have positioned itself to garner considerable interest. Once the presale is live, users can invest in a project that could reinvent DeFi.

BlockDAG ’s affiliate program rewards users and their friends with 10% cashback in USDT on all purchases, enhancing community ties and providing instant benefits. Ethereum is making strides toward a $3,500 target, powered by solid technical indicators, while XRP has reached the $3 mark for the first time in six years despite potential legal hurdles and market corrections. Unlike Ethereum and XRP, which depend on market trends, BlockDAG offers concrete advantages through its affiliate program and strong presale performance, establishing it as a solid candidate for both immediate and future financial gains. Earn Big with BlockDAG: 10% Cashback Ends Soon! BlockDAG has introduced a 10-day affiliate program where users can gain 10% cashback in USDT on each referral and purchase, ensuring mutual benefits—both the referrer and the referred get 10% back. This makes for an appealing way to boost your crypto holdings. How It Works: Register for the affiliate program on BlockDAG’s website. Share your unique referral link with friends.

Example Scenarios: Refer 5 friends who each buy $1,000 in BDAG coins, and you get $500 USDT, with your friends also collecting $500 USDT.

BlockDAG is currently conducting its 27th presale batch at $0.0248 per coin, having already gathered over $181 million with more than 17.9 billion coins sold. Ethereum Poised for Growth: Bulls Aim for $3,500 Ethereum’s upward momentum is building, as it rises past $3,240 and stabilizes above $3,320, supported by the 100-hour Simple Moving Average. A breakout at $3,300 on the hourly chart has added strength to the bullish outlook. Recently, Ethereum touched $3,473 before facing resistance near $3,480. Despite a slight pullback, support at $3,350 has held strong, leaving room for further growth. Breaking past $3,500 could pave the way for Ethereum to reach $3,550 or even higher levels. The signs are encouraging. The MACD is gaining strength in the bullish zone, and the RSI remains above 50, showing steady buyer confidence. With solid support levels in place, Ethereum is in a strong position to continue its climb. The future looks bright as it eyes the $3,500 mark and beyond. XRP Hits $3 After Six Years: Is More Growth Ahead? XRP has made an impressive comeback, climbing to $3 for the first time in six years with a 25% gain in just a week. Investors are optimistic, anticipating pro-crypto regulatory changes under the incoming Trump administration, which could pave the way for further growth. While technical indicators like the RSI suggest a potential overbought scenario and hint at a possible 20% correction toward $2.52, this is often part of a healthy market cycle. Corrections can create opportunities for new investors to join the rally. Although the SEC’s renewed focus on XRP as an unregistered security poses challenges, Ripple’s resilience in the face of legal battles could position XRP for long-term success. With its recent surge, the future of XRP looks promising for both short-term and long-term investors. Final Thoughts Ethereum’s ascent toward $3,500 illustrates its potential driven by solid technicals, while XRP’s climb to $3 indicates a blend of optimism and regulatory challenges. BlockDAG, however, offers more than just speculative potential—its affiliate program delivers immediate 10% cash-back rewards, promoting active community involvement. With a successful presale exceeding $181 million, BlockDAG presents itself as a prudent choice for buyers looking for both quick returns and long-term prospects. Through its innovative approach, BlockDAG provides opportunities that go beyond following market fluctuations, appealing to those who value both stability and growth potential.

The price increase represents a 5.2% increase over the past 24 hours and marks a sharp recovery from the start of the week when Bitcoin fell below $90,000 amid a broad market sell-off. The rally, which has seen BTC surge 17%, began as investor concerns eased following Wednesday’s US CPI inflation report. Speculation about Trump’s potential actions regarding cryptocurrency policy, such as easing regulations and creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve, further fueled the bullish trend as the Jan. 20 inauguration approaches. Bitcoin has successfully broken out of a multi-week downtrend, surpassing last week’s high of $102,000, with analysts now eyeing key resistance levels. Related News: Big Day in Bitcoin on Monday, Analyst Says: ""It's Definitely Coming"" “Near-term target resistance is now $108,000. There are many reasons for bullishness,” Alex Thorn, Galaxy’s research manager, said on X (formerly Twitter). Similarly, John Glover, Chief Investment Officer of crypto lender Ledn, described Bitcoin’s technical setup as “very constructive” as Biden enters the final week of his presidency. “The only risk to a corrective move would be if Trump fails to act on his plans to ease regulatory policies for digital assets or create BTC treasury holdings,” Glover wrote in a note to clients, drawing on recent headlines suggesting Trump is determined to make crypto a priority in his first 100 days. Using wave theory, Glover predicted that Bitcoin could reach $128,000 in the coming months, completing a larger third wave in the uptrend. According to this theory, market trends occur in five waves, three of which are in line with the main trend while two represent pullbacks. Breaking above the all-time high of $108,000 is critical to sustaining the current bullish momentum. While Glover acknowledged that the likelihood of BTC revisiting its recent low of $90,000 is low, he noted that this scenario is becoming increasingly less likely as momentum builds. *This is not investment advice.

In a January 17 blog post centered on “economic freedom,” Armstrong positioned Bitcoin as a cornerstone of a new digital economy, urging policymakers to embrace cryptocurrencies as a hedge against inflation and a tool for national security. Labeling cryptocurrencies as “the next chapter of capitalism,” Armstrong suggested that the global arms race of the 21st century would center around digital assets rather than traditional frontiers like space exploration. “Bitcoin could become as essential to the global economy as gold,” Armstrong predicted, adding that the accumulation of Bitcoin reserves by nations could redefine power dynamics in the digital age. Coinbase CEO Calls for a Bitcoin-Backed Future Armstrong’s proposal comes at a time of shifting priorities in U.S. economic and regulatory policy. President-elect Donald Trump has hinted at making cryptocurrency a national priority in 2025, potentially including plans for a federal Bitcoin reserve. While details remain speculative, the idea aligns with Armstrong’s call for crypto-friendly laws, government efficiency, and special economic zones designed to integrate digital assets into mainstream financial systems. Coinbase has deepened its influence in Washington, D.C., contributing over $45 million to the Fairshake political action committee during the 2024 election cycle and donating $1 million to President-elect Trump’s inauguration fund. Armstrong himself reportedly met with Trump in November to discuss personnel appointments, underscoring the company’s growing role in shaping U.S. crypto policy . Despite Coinbase’s optimism, vice president of U.S. policy Kara Calvert remained cautious, stating the company was “eager to work” with the incoming administration but refraining from commenting on specific plans for a national Bitcoin stockpile. Regulatory Challenges Loom While Armstrong’s forward-looking proposals signal hope for crypto adoption, Coinbase continues to grapple with significant legal challenges. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has accused the exchange of operating as an unregistered securities platform, a case currently pending appellate court rulings. In addition, Coinbase has been embroiled in lawsuits against the SEC and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, alleging attempts to “debank” crypto firms. The company has also pressed the SEC to clarify which digital assets qualify as securities, a debate central to the evolving regulatory landscape.

Let’s explore what sets this Floki competitor apart and why it could be poised for an 8000x rally.

With its strong presale performance, raising $10.6 million, Lightchain AI demonstrates significant market interest and confidence in its potential. This momentum positions it as a project with substantial growth opportunities, rivaling even established meme coins like Floki. Why Lightchain AI could lead the next altcoin rally The total crypto market cap has just broken through a key resistance level, signaling a bullish phase for altcoins — and it’s creating the perfect storm for projects like Lightchain AI to thrive. Analysts are buzzing about Lightchain AI’s growth potential, and here’s why. First, it’s not just another hype-driven coin. Lightchain AI delivers real-world solutions to industry challenges, standing out in a sea of meme coins. Second, its ongoing presale is a golden opportunity for early investors to get in before the project gains mainstream traction. And third, with a strong focus on sustainability, Lightchain AI aligns perfectly with the global shift toward eco-conscious practices.

Introducing the $TRUMP Meme Coin Trump’s official X (formerly Twitter) and Truth Social accounts shared news of a Solana-based memecoin, $TRUMP. “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW,” the post read, linking to a website. Within hours, $TRUMP’s market cap surged to nearly $7.5 trillion. Trading volume approached $1 billion, and the coin’s value soared more than 300%, jumping from $0.18 to $7.1. https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1880446012168249386 The coin launched with 200 million tokens out of a total supply of 1 billion, which will be gradually released over the next three years. How to Buy $TRUMP To buy $TRUMP, users need to use a Solana-based exchange like Jupiter and a non-custodial wallet, such as Phantom. The coin’s contract address is available on CoinMarketCap and SolScan. It’s essential to verify the address, as fake versions of the coin are already circulating. Purchases can be made in SOL or other SOL-compatible tokens. When buying $TRUMP, users also gain access to the Trump Meme Community, which promotes success and optimism. Is $TRUMP Legit? Experts Weigh In Blockchain engineer Cygaar suggests that the new meme coin is likely created by the same team behind Trump’s previous NFT project, as the websites share several technical similarities. Additionally, Slorg, a member of Jupiter’s Core Working Group, confirmed that $TRUMP has been verified and listed on the Jupiter Exchange. The Story Behind $TRUMP According to The Trump Meme website, the coin’s assets are minted through the Solana blockchain. The website features a meme of President Trump with his fist raised and signature, marking the coin as a “piece of history.” The description highlights that on July 13, 2024, President Trump “faced death and came up fighting,” adding a personal touch to the meme. The website also states that the coin is apolitical and not associated with any political campaign or office. Despite this, Trump and his family have been promoting a wide range of products during the 2024 campaign and as his inauguration approaches. These include a version of the holy book, a Les Paul-style guitar from “Trump Guitars,” gold Trump sneakers, assassination attempt cologne, and $100,000 watches. Trump’s Growing Crypto Presence In September, Trump announced that he and his family are launching a crypto business called World Liberty Financial. While $TRUMP has generated attention, its long-term value and potential remain uncertain. Is $TRUMP here to stay?

Chainlink Ecosystem Thrives & SUI Predictions Hint Growth The Chainlink ecosystem is gaining momentum with whale investors and major institutions leveraging its technology for Web3 advancements, driving confidence in LINK’s long-term growth. Meanwhile, analysts remain optimistic about the SUI price prediction, with bullish patterns and growing market interest hinting at potential gains in 2025. Adding to the excitement, BlockDAG (BDAG) has launched one of the market’s most lucrative affiliate programs — a 10% instant USDT cashback to both referrers and buyers of the BDAG coin! With this limited-time offer running for just 10 days, the rush is on to secure what’s widely seen as the top crypto for 2025, all while earning extra USDT. Whale Investors Boost Confidence in Chainlink Ecosystem The Chainlink ecosystem continues to draw attention as it becomes a cornerstone for blockchain and Web3 adoption. Recent data reveals that whale investors, holding balances between 100,000 and 1 million LINK coins, acquired 1.35 million tokens in the past 24 hours. This uptick in activity coincides with the Chainlink CCIP v1.5 upgrade, enabling cross-chain token transfers across 20+ blockchains. Additionally, institutions like BNY Mellon and JPMorgan have adopted Chainlink’s framework to facilitate tokenisation and financial operations. As the Chainlink ecosystem expands through institutional integration and technological upgrades, it demonstrates increasing utility and relevance within the blockchain industry. SUI Price Prediction Highlights Bullish Signs for 2025 The SUI price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential bullish shift as the coin forms a rounding bottom pattern on its weekly technical chart. Currently priced at $4.66 with a market cap of $14.04 billion, SUI is attracting renewed investor interest. Analysts anticipate the coin may challenge its all-time high resistance of $5, indicating a possible trend reversal. Predictions for 2025 estimate the average trading price to be $4.77, with a range from $4.74 to $4.80. While market sentiment remains mixed, the technical outlook provides cautious optimism for traders monitoring SUI price prediction trends. BlockDAG’s 10-Day Offer: 10% USDT Cashback for Buyers & Referrers The new BlockDAG Affiliate Program presents an exciting chance for participants to maximize their crypto earnings with minimal effort. For the next 10 days, both referrers and referees can claim an instant 10% USDT cashback on every BDAG coin purchase. For example, if a buyer purchases $1,000 worth of BDAG coins using a referral link, they instantly receive $100 in USDT cashback, while the referrer also earns $100 in USDT. The process is designed to be seamless and rewarding. Wallets connected to the BlockDAG dashboard generate a unique referral link, which can be shared with friends, communities, or networks. Each successful purchase through the link triggers a 10% cashback payout in USDT (BEP-20) to both the referrer and the buyer, which is credited instantly! As BDAG’s presale gains momentum, participants have a unique window to amplify their earnings while introducing others to one of the top cryptos for 2025. The affiliate program is not just about the immediate 10% cashback—it also provides an entry point into one of the most successful crypto presales in history. With BlockDAG’s presale already raising over $181.5 million and rapidly surging toward its $600 million target, participating now means getting in at a crucial moment before the presale closes. BDAG’s value has surged by 2380%, climbing from $0.001 to $0.0248 as demand continues to rise. With billions of coins already sold, this moment offers a fleeting chance to acquire BDAG at its current price. Long-term projections position BDAG among the top cryptos for 2025, making this a win-win situation for buyers — a short-term opportunity and a strategic holding of a promising crypto. Key Insights As the Chainlink ecosystem continues to attract whale investors and institutional adoption, its role in advancing Web3 technology solidifies its market relevance. Similarly, the SUI price prediction shows promise, with bullish technical patterns suggesting notable growth potential in 2025. However, BlockDAG is stealing the spotlight with its limited-time affiliate program, offering 10% instant USDT cashback to both referrers and buyers—a true win-win for participants. With over $181.5 million already raised and the $600 million presale target approaching at a record pace, BDAG’s momentum is undeniable. As BDAG’s value continues to rise, this limited opportunity for buyers to secure the top crypto for 2025 while making extra USDT is slipping away.

The market maker Wintermute called for an upcoming ETF based on a meme token, and made a bet on DOGE. Wintermute, one of the top meme token market makers, suggested a Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF may be in the making for 2025. The rise of meme tokens replaced the more established altcoins. As institutions moved in, Wintermute expected memes to be taken seriously enough to build an ETF around one of the top assets, as outlined in its 2025 outlook report. Wintermute predicted a DOGE ETF for 2025. | Source: Wintermute 2025 outlook The potential for more DOGE exposure and mainstream investment boosted the coin after the latest market rally. DOGE broke out above $0.41, near the highest range for the past month. The memecoin renewed the expectations for a rally back to $1 as crypto adoption widens in 2025. For Wintermute, DOGE was the most probable answer, due to the coin’s legacy status and liquidity. DOGE is still lumped together with newer memes, and makes up more than 53% of the ecosystem. While ShibaInu (SHIB) is also influential, Wintermute believed DOGE would be the asset picked for a new fund. Wintermute has been bullish on memes, becoming the market maker for both prominent tokens and those just starting out. However, the known wallet of Wintermute is not holding any DOGE. Wintermute predicted that in 2025, mainstream finance would discover more tools to tap crypto earnings, while limiting volatility. The market maker expects more ETF products to roll out in 2025, providing more exposure for mainstream investors. After the success of single-coin ETFs, focused on BTC and ETH, Wintermute predicts multi-asset products for broader baskets of crypto coins and tokens. Some of the ETF products may start tracking trends in the market, including memes. DOGE is already an asset under consideration by Grayscale, which does not limit the fund issuer to a specific deadline for creating products. While DOGE is widely available for mainstream buyers, an ETF may increase new investments dramatically. Grayscale also pointed to DOGE in its recent report on the top 10 appreciating assets for the past week. DOGE was right behind XRP and Cardano (ADA), as buyers accumulated tokens considered on the verge of a bigger breakout. DOGE may have a higher chance for an ETF, if Litecoin (LTC) also gets onboarded to a mainstream fund. DOGE is still mined through Litecoin blocks, making it one of the most secure meme coins. Whales move in during Dogecoin rally In the short term, DOGE is rising on renewed interest from whales. In the past, large-scale buyers have moved in to scoop up more DOGE, due to the asset’s ability to appreciate. 🚨 🚨 80,452,117 #DOGE (33,127,063 USD) transferred from #Robinhood to unknown wallet https://t.co/FV4f1wCkh1 — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 17, 2025 Whales poured $200M into the market during the rapid rally of DOGE. Exchange wallets also increased their balances. Notable whale transactions moved 600M DOGE in a few hours, extending the period of accumulation. The wave of buying arrived with technical predictions of a bigger price breakout, as DOGE consolidated close to $0.40. The XRP rally also helped DOGE, which has been predicted to go as high as $1. DOGE continues to grow its supply each day, with 10,000 new coins created every two minutes. Miners are among the big holders of DOGE, due to co-mining with LTC. Compared to newer top memes like WIF and PEPE, DOGE is still more liquid and has accrued listing and users. DOGE is held in 143,872 wallets, though over 30% of the coins are held by whales.

That was the question plaguing crypto traders from U.S. to Asia alike as an “official” memecoin linked to Republican Donald Trump was issued in early Asian hours Saturday from his verified X and Truth Social accounts. Prices ran from few cents to $14 in less than six hours amid widespread confusion on whether the token was actually backed by Trump or was a possible hack of Trump’s account with a fake token issued by the attacker to fleece unsuspecting buyers. CoinDesk could not independently confirm if the token was legit or not as of early European hours Saturday. The token — which is viewed with scepticism among some traders — has attracted $3 billion in trading volumes hours after going live and commands a $2 billion market capitalization at current prices. It has netted early buyers over $70 million in paper gains, and smaller traders as much as $1 million, onchain data shows. The apparent move comes days before Trump takes office on Jan.20, and is the first time a sitting president will give their liking to a memecoin. It’s the latest in a long list of crypto-related businesses and products linked to Trump — with the Republican having previously issued multiple NFTs and the relatively new decentralized finance platform World Liberty Financial. “My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!,” an X post from the @realDonaldTrump account reads. “Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW. Go to http://gettrumpmemes.com — Have Fun!” The X post went up on 2:44 UTC Saturday and has stayed up until after 8:15 UTC. It was initially perceived to be The token was first posted on Trump’s Truth Social, where it ran from a fully diluted valuation of $200 million to over $1.3 billion in just over an hour. It gained traction and interest from crypto traders after the X post. A disclaimer on the meme’s website stated that the Trump meme token were intended to function as an “expression of support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol $TRUMP” and are not “intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.” The reasoning is in line with how memecoin markets have shaped up since late 2024, moving away from mere tokens related to pictures (such as dogecoin) to cult tokens where holders believe in a shared vision or idea that the brand implies (such as SPX6900 flipping the U.S. stock market, or MOG representing “tokenized winning.”) Meanwhile, some previously-issued memecoins themed after Trump took a hit early Saturday, dropping as much as 50% as their value proposition fell.",Markets,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|MOG,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-18 09:31:25

If 2021 was the year of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, this January feels like meme coin season on steroids. New projects are dropping left and right, and the hype is real. But let’s cut through the noise, here are 6 meme coins you need to know about, including the one that’s already redefining the landscape of presales. 1. Doge Uprising ($DUP) Let’s start with the headliner. Doge Uprising is building a whole new narrative. Imagine a dystopian future where Doge Mechas take on Elon Musk’s NeuroChain. Sounds like a sci-fi movie, right? Well, $DUP brings it to life with manga-inspired NFTs, staking rewards with 50% APY, and a presale that’s already raised $125,000 in its first week. Why is this one worth watching? Early adopters are already locking in their positions, and you could be one of them. If you missed Dogecoin at $0.001, maybe don’t sit this one out. 2. PEPE Ah, PEPE. The meme coin that took 2023 by storm, hitting a $1.6 billion market cap at its peak. Sure, it’s down 33% from its ATH now, but it’s still the reigning king of the frog coin world. PEPE’s sheer virality makes it interesting. This coin has become a cultural phenomenon, proving that memes are more than just jokes. PEPE’s no longer a moonshot, but it’s far from dead. With its massive community and ongoing updates, it’s staying relevant in a space that moves faster than Twitter drama. 3. BONK Solana’s first major meme coin is still near the top of the charts. BONK launched in 2023 and quickly became the face of Solana’s resurgence. Its community-first tokenomics and low entry price have kept it buzzing, even after a 50% dip from its all-time high. What’s the play here? BONK remains a bet on Solana’s ecosystem. If Solana keeps gaining traction, BONK will surely rise with it. 4. Wall Street Pepe (WEPE) If PEPE is the king of meme coins, Wall Street Pepe is the rebel prince. Born in the chaos of the bull run in 2024, WEPE taps into the retail investor movement, combining meme culture with a not-so-subtle jab at Wall Street greed. Almost $50 million in its presale proves it’s doing a pretty good job. WEPE is a disruptor; think GameStop, but with frogs. 5. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) Pudgy Penguins isn’t just a meme coin; it’s an empire. After first making a splash in the NFT space, $PENGU launched in 2024, and the community went wild. With over 50 billion views online and partnerships with major brands, Pudgy Penguins has become a cultural icon. The coin itself benefits from the project’s expansive ecosystem, which includes NFTs, merch, and even TV appearances. For fans of meme coins with real-world reach, $PENGU is a solid pick. 6. FLOKI FLOKI has been around for a while, but it’s still holding strong. Inspired by Elon Musk’s Shiba Inu, this meme coin has consistently reinvented itself with DeFi integrations, NFTs, and even a play-to-earn game. It’s not the flashiest coin on the list, but FLOKI’s steady community and development make it an underdog player in the meme coin space. The Final Verdict Meme coins are the Wild West of crypto. They’re unpredictable, volatile, and can be wildly profitable if you get in early. For those looking for the next big thing, Doge Uprising is the breakout star to watch. Its combination of early presale buzz and strong community could make it the 2025 meme coin of the year. But hey, don’t sleep on the veterans like PEPE and FLOKI or the rising stars like WEPE and BONK. Meme coins thrive on hype, community, and timing. So, which one’s going in your wallet?

XRP rallied from $2.3 to $3.4 in the past seven days, marking a price surge of 47%. The XRP token is expected to benefit significantly under the Trump administration. XRP faces a potential correction to the $3 level after a sharp rally, fueled by rumors that President-elect Donald Trump may consider XRP for inclusion in the U.S. national reserve. Ripple, the U.S.-based company behind XRP, has since brought on discussions about its potential influence on national financial policies. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.14, down 5.25% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap data . The digital currency recently hit a seven-year high of $3.40 before dropping to a daily low of $3.09 as sellers gained momentum. Currently, XRP is 18.42% below its all-time high of $3.84, recorded in January 2018. XRP appears to have established support at the $3 level, with resistance looming above $3.40. The token, which failed to breach a $200 billion market cap, is now valued at approximately $180.91 billion.

Table of Contents Solana consolidates, forming a bullish cup-and-handle pattern Uniswap is ready to retest its all-time high Elluminex looks set for an explosive 2025 rally In Conclusion While many top crypto coins have skyrocketed in value in this bull market, there are a handful that have remained at attractive prices. According to speculators, Solana (SOL) , Uniswap (UNI), and Elluminex (ELX) are some underpriced cryptos that could explode soon. While many speculators believe SOL could rally to $1,000 soon, UNI could retest $50 over the next few weeks. However, savvy market participants have identified ELX as the best cryptocurrency to buy now as it looks to tap a market with around 1 billion users.

CoinMarketCap’s data shows that the Solana crypto has consolidated between $200 and $240 throughout December 2024. However, technical analyses from both Ali Martinez and CryptoBoss show that a cup and handle pattern has been formed on the 1m Solana price chart. The CryptoBoss believes that SOL could hit $400 by end of January 2025 because of this long-term bullish continuation pattern. Martinez has set an even higher target for the Solana coin. The technical analyst believes that SOL is more undervalued and could pump to $4,013 if this pattern plays out completely. A rally from its current range to $4,013 represents an increase of over 1,860%, making Solana one of the best altcoins to buy now. Uniswap is ready to retest its all-time high Despite Uniswap’s reputation and massive share in the DEX market, its performance in the bull market does not reflect its capabilities. The Uniswap crypto is still trading 61% lower than its all-time high of $45, per data from CoinMarketCap. Due to months of consolidation, market speculators now believe UNI is cheap and could record a huge pump. The Uniswap price chart shared by Crypto Tigers shows that UNI has broken out and retested its area of consolidation, prepping the altcoin price for a bounce toward $50. Cryptobud believes that this could happen in 2025, saying that Uniswap is ready to attack its ATH. According to Cryptobud, the upcoming 2025 launch of Unichain, which will process faster transactions, is one of the reasons the Uniswap token will rally. He also explained that there has been an increase in trading volume on the DEX in anticipation of favorable government regulations in 2025. Elluminex looks set for an explosive 2025 rally Ethereum has Uniswap, BNB has PancakeSwap, Solana has Jupiter, and now Toncoin has Elluminex . DeFi market speculators believe Elluminex could be the next phenomenon in the market because of the huge impact it could have on the future of DeFi even beyond the Toncoin network. Unlike other top DeFi projects, Elluminex is a DeFi hub with several products designed to unlock the full potential of DeFi on the fastest-growing blockchain platform, TON. There is a next-gen cross-chain platform that will improve the interoperability of the Toncoin blockchain. This opens up traders to diverse trading and maximizes asset utility across multiple chains. In Conclusion The current bull market might be at its peak, but there are still several opportunities out there. Traders looking to double their portfolio could look to buy into Solana and Uniswap. However, savvy market participants looking for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, are buying into the Elluminex vision. To learn more about Elluminex, visit the website , Twitter and Telegram .

The altcoins have finally started to retreat after the recent gains, aside from SOL, which has emerged as today’s top gainer. BTC Stopped at $105K The highly volatile trading week began with a massive price drop for the largest cryptocurrency that pushed it from $96,000 to a multi-month low of $89,200 (on Bitstamp). After losing so much value within a day, the bulls finally intercepted the asset’s freefall at this point and reversed its trajectory. Within 24 hours, BTC had regained more than seven grand and stood at around $97,000. The US CPI numbers that were announced on Wednesday brought even more gains, somewhat surprisingly, and bitcoin jumped to $98,500 and then kept climbing toward $100,000. After a minor rejection there, the cryptocurrency flew past that coveted level. The culmination transpired yesterday when the asset jumped to its highest levels since the all-time high in mid-December of $106,000. However, it couldn’t continue toward the peak of over $108,000 and started to lose value. As of now, BTC trades at $103,000, which has pushed its market cap to almost $2.050 trillion on CG. Its dominance over the alts is also on the rise, close to 55%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView SOL Defies the Odds Many altcoins charted notable gains in the past few days but have gone into a retracement mode today. XRP has been at the forefront, coming 1% away from a new all-time high at $3.4 . However, it was stopped there and now struggles at $3.1. Ethereum has dropped below $3,300, BNB is at $700, DOGE is under $0.4, and ADA has lost the $1.1 level. More losses come from AVAX, XLM, SHIB, HBAR, DOT, and others. In contrast, SOL has soared by 10% and has tapped its highest level since early December of almost $240. The total crypto market cap has declined slightly since yesterday’s peak, but it is still above $3.7 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Price-action in bitcoin (BTC) and most majors, such as dogecoin (DOGE) and BNB Chain’s BNB, remained muted as the TRUMP token shifted sentiment for XRP and ETH. Traders perceived the Trump memecoin’s choice of issuing the token on Solana as bearish for Ethereum. An “official” memecoin linked to Trump was issued in early Asian hours Saturday from his verified X and Truth Social accounts. Prices ran from a few cents to $14 in less than six hours amid widespread confusion on whether the token was backed by Trump, as reported . Some fund managers consider the move to be bullish for memecoins: “The incoming President just gave everyone license to launch a memecoin - $SOL is getting the message, buckle up,” Placeholder VC partner Chris Burniske wrote on X. Elsewhere, XRP slumped as much as 5% to pare gains from a 40% gain over the past 7 days. Demand for XRP has surged since early November when Republican Trump won the U.S. presidential elections and promised to make the country a hotbed for local crypto businesses — improving sentiment for tokens linked to U.S. companies (XRP is closely related to New York-based Ripple Labs.) XRP broke the $3 mark for the first time since 2018 on Friday ahead of Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20. The speculative move came on unconfirmed reports that Trump was open to an “America-first strategic reserve that would prioritize digital coins founded in the U.S., like Solana, USD Coin and Ripple.” Talks of any strategic reserve have so far only included plans for bitcoin holdings. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse had at least one meeting with the President-elect in early January, bumping speculation that Ripple could potentially have a direct channel to influence the incoming administration, causing heightened interest in XRP.",Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-18 09:57:31

A new bill , titled “State Funds-Investment in Bitcoin,” was introduced on January 17, just days before President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. If passed, the bill would authorize Wyoming to invest a portion of its state funds in Bitcoin, reinforcing its reputation as a pioneer in financial innovation. The proposal allows the Wyoming state treasurer to allocate up to 3% of funds from the general fund, the Permanent Wyoming Mineral Trust Fund, and the Permanent Land Fund into Bitcoin. Notably, the bill stipulates that if Bitcoin’s market value exceeds this 3% threshold, the state treasurer will not be required to liquidate holdings to meet the limit, signaling a long-term commitment to the asset. Wyoming Proposes Bold Bitcoin Investment Plan Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis, a staunch Bitcoin advocate, lauded the initiative on social media, calling it a “bold step toward a strategic Bitcoin reserve.” Lummis, who also introduced a similar bill at the federal level in July 2024, commended Wyoming Representative Jacob Wasserburger for championing the legislation, emphasizing its potential to position the state as a leader in financial innovation. “This forward-thinking approach will benefit our state as we lead the nation in financial innovation,” Lummis stated, underscoring the importance of diversification and Bitcoin’s growing role in modern finance. The bill’s introduction aligns with a broader trend of state-level interest in Bitcoin reserves. Wyoming joins a growing list of states, including Pennsylvania, Texas, and Ohio, that have proposed similar legislation, reflecting a collective recognition of Bitcoin as a strategic asset. Nationwide Momentum Builds The push for state-level Bitcoin reserves coincides with mounting speculation about the Trump administration’s potential plans to establish a national Bitcoin reserve . Betting platforms Kalshi and Polymarket have seen a surge in odds favoring the move, amplifying interest in state initiatives. Wyoming’s proposal also comes amid rising scrutiny of the U.S. government’s handling of its own Bitcoin holdings. On January 15, Lummis penned a letter to the U.S. Marshals Service questioning plans to liquidate 69,370 Bitcoin seized from the Silk Road asset forfeiture. She described the potential sale as politically motivated and urged for greater transparency.

Elon Bromance (ELOBRO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOBRO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Bromance by entering its contract address – FY7aYv7K3yEE9Z8hzgURj5z7biTE8Z6BpunBPAnCEpxj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner.

Bitcoin climbed back above $100,000 following bullish speculations by renowned cryptocurrency stakeholders, including Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Michael Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Investment Partners.

National Vote To Decide,https://coingape.com/will-switzerland-adopt-bitcoin-reserve-national-vote-to-decide/,"Switzerland is gearing up to adopt the Bitcoin reserve amidst growing cryptocurrency acceptance fueled by Donald Trump’s progressive policies. Cryptocurrency advocates nationwide propose considering BTC as a reserve asset along with the dollar, euro, and gold. This initiative tends to provide Bitcoin legal recognition in the European country. As per a recent report , the campaigners have begun collecting 100,000 signatures, triggering a national vote on Bitcoin adoption. This move could potentially pressure the Swiss National Bank (SNB) to reconsider its pessimistic approach to the flagship cryptocurrency. Switzerland To Vote For Bitcoin Reserve The Swiss Federal Chancellery kicked off the Bitcoin reserve proposal on December 31, 2024, following a failed attempt in October 2021. The motion gained increased attention when Donald Trump, who hails himself the “crypto President,” won the 2024 US election. The country launched the BTC proposal to amend the Swiss Federal Constitution, facilitating the addition of Bitcoin to the SNB portfolio. The deadline to gather the required signatures is June 30, 2026. After fulfilling the signature count, the proposal would reach the Federal Assembly and then for a public vote. Commenting on the Swiss public’s positive sentiment towards BTC reserve, crypto enthusiast Rino Borini cited, People here certainly show more interest and openness for Bitcoin as a store of value than in neighboring countries. It’s like with cash. The Swiss like it for its security and privacy. BTC To Overpower Centralized Assets While most of the reserve assets of the central bank are foreign, Switzerland is often dependent on other governments. With the adoption of a BTC reserve, many believe that the decentralized crypto asset could make the country’s financial ecosystem independent. Nonetheless, the traditionally conservative SNB has expressed skepticism over the Bitcoin reserve proposal despite growing public support for its adoption. Addressing the high volatility of BTC, SNB Chair Martin Schlegel raised concerns over the viability of crypto as payment. He dismissed the proposal in November, describing cryptocurrency as a “niche phenomenon.” In addition, the largest crypto by market cap constantly shows an unpredictable nature, which remains a major barrier for many to consider it a legitimate asset. UBS economist Alessandro Bee warned that Bitcoin’s high volatility poses risks of SNB’s equity shrinking with market fall. He added, “Over a longer period of time, the SNB’s credibility could suffer.” Swiss Economy Embraces Future of Finance Switzerland has been at the forefront of crypto adoption and blockchain advancements. The favorable regulatory framework and advanced technologies of the country have contributed to the growth of the Swiss crypto ecosystem. Also, the nation’s “crypto valley” and blockchain-focused education solidify its position as a global hub for cryptocurrency. Given that the Swiss accept the Bitcoin reserve proposal, it could potentially push the country to become a global leader. The post Will Switzerland Adopt Bitcoin Reserve?

This time, it’s because he has evidently launched a meme coin that has already soared in value and is among the top 40 largest altcoins by market cap. Trump’s Official Meme Coin It’s safe to say that the crypto community has seen a lot of strange things in the past decade, especially when it comes down to meme coins. After all, there are some based on dogs, cats, famous frog characters, dead squirrels, and so on. However, it’s not every day that you see the promotion of a meme coin made by the president-elect of the world’s largest economy. Donald J. Trump, through his official accounts on Truth Social and X, announced yesterday that he has a new ‘official’ meme coin and urged his almost 100 million followers to ‘join my very special Trump Community.’ My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It’s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW. Go to https://t.co/GX3ZxT5xyq — Have Fun! pic.twitter.com/flIKYyfBrC — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025 A lot of people questioned the legitimacy of the project and guessed that his account was hacked. However, that doesn’t seem likely at the moment. The meme coin’s website resembles those made for Trump’s official NFT collections in the past, credited to the same licensee – CIC Digital. It shows that the current circulating supply is 200 million, but it could go up to as high as a billion within the next three years. Somewhat alarmingly, the groups that will own the biggest shares are ‘creators and CIC Digital,’ with a total percentage of 72%. While others praised the move and officially welcomed Trump to the cryptocurrency space, even though he already has such a project called World Liberty , some, such as ZachXBT, were a lot more skeptical . Welcome to Top 40 OFFICIAL TRUMP (TRUMP) is obviously today’s top gainer, and its value has skyrocketed by triple digits. According to data from CMC and CG, its market cap has soared to over $4 billion. Although the two platforms have slightly different valuations ($4.3 billion vs $4.05 billion) at press time, TRUMP has entered the top 40 largest alts by market cap on both. Moreover, TRUMP’s gains come amid a massive retracement from all other meme coins based on his presidential campaign and upcoming presidency.

When Do Experts Expect Approval?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-latest-on-solana-etfs-when-do-experts-expect-approval/,"As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office, the crypto industry is abuzz with optimism about the potential for groundbreaking policy changes under the new administration. With Trump widely considered the most openly pro-crypto president in U.S. history, many expect a regulatory environment that encourages cooperation rather than enforcement. One of the most hotly debated questions is whether the new administration will make it easier to approve spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Solana (SOL). Solana received significant attention in November after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) hinted that it would look into S-1 ETF filings. But under its current leadership, the SEC has rejected filings from leading issuers including VanEck, 21Shares, Bitwise, WisdomTree and Canary Capital. “The SEC essentially refused to accept the latest Solana ETF filings,” according to Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart. Although applicants have filed the necessary 19b-4 forms to propose rule changes, sources claim the SEC has requested that all applications be withdrawn. These forms were critical to the approval of spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs last year, supporting market optimism. Related News: Veteran Analyst Reveals the Scenario He Expects in Bitcoin This Weekend With the SEC leadership changing under Trump, analysts and industry leaders are cautiously optimistic. ETF Store President Nate Geraci suggested that Solana ETFs could receive approval by the end of 2025. However, regulatory timelines are quite strict. “The earliest approval is probably 240 days after new applications are filed,” said a senior executive at a company planning to issue the Solana ETF. “I would be very surprised if it’s earlier.” The executive noted that 240 days represents the statutory deadline for SEC responses after applications are filed. Steven McClurg, chief investment officer at Canary Capital, noted potential delays due to leadership transitions. “The optimistic estimate is by the end of 2025. It’s possible, but it’s very optimistic,” he said. “Crypto is not a top priority for the SEC, it’s a top priority for us, but not for them,” he added. Similarly, Vivian Fang, a finance professor at Indiana University, noted that while Trump’s administration has become more crypto-friendly, regulatory changes take time. “Even with a new SEC chair, many of the staff in the Division of Trading and Markets remain the same,” she said, cautioning against expecting immediate transformation. *This is not investment advice.

In this period, the token formed multiple rallies but failed to surpass the ATH set four years ago. However, the current technical setup presents a LINK uptrend with a price targeting $50. Let’s discuss how these ambitious Chainlink price predictions will take place. Chainlink Price To Hit $50 Per Bull Flag Pattern After its bullish performance, the LINK token has gained investors’ attention. A crypto analyst, Michael van de Poppe, has called Chainlink a blue chip while highlighting its long-term growth potential. Others have predicted that this token will hit $32, $35, and even $50. At present, it is among the top cryptos of the market , trading at $24.30 with $15.5B in market capitalization. Interestingly, at this point, crypto analyst Ali Martinez identified the formation of the bull flag pattern, with which Chainlink price could target $50 in the long run. According to Ali LINK prediction , the four-hour price chart showcases the formation of a falling wedge pattern, which usually results in a breakout. The current level presents the token near the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, acting as a launchpad for a bullish rally. The price breakdown will be confirmed at $24.47, from where it will initially target $27.18 and $30.36. According to him, the continuity of the uptrend will result in Chainlink price hitting $37.61, $41.80, $50.93, and eventually $58.63 at the extreme. However, in contrast, the price can decline to $20.45 before finding support at that level. Although the bullish flag represents an upcoming uptrend, additional factors cater to this bullishness. Other Factors Favoring LINK’s Bullish Momentum The rumor of the Chainlink and BlackRock partnership is swinging investors’ sentiments towards the token. If this happened, the LINK price could hit new ATH, per a CoinGape article. Moreover, whale activity is at its peak for the crypto token, showing strong confidence in a bullish trajectory. A recent IntoTheBlock report mentioned the rise of large investors’ transaction volume from $35.6M to $185M within a week. It reached a peak transaction count of 613, which represents the increased interest of the large buyers, which drives the price rally. This demand and user confidence are also visible in Chainlink’s trading volume, which is maintaining a peak of around $1B. Such high trading volume often leads to further price uptrends. There are other factors, like Chainlink’s CCIP v1.5 upgrade and partnership with BTguru and many others, that help with its adoption. Key Points To Remember Despite the constant failures to achieve the ATH, the LINK token price is constantly rising with its growing adoption and investor interest. Multiple crypto analysts have presented a bullish outlook for the token, where Ali Martinez predicts Chainlink price will soon achieve the $50 and higher target. Ali’s prediction is based on the appearance of the bull flag pattern, indicating growth from the current level towards the new ATH. However, this analysis is based on current stats, so investors must run their own research and analysis, as market unpredictability could change the price trajectory.

With its presale raising an impressive $10.6 million at a token price of $0.00525, Lightchain AI is emerging as a transformative force in the cryptocurrency market, offering both innovation and massive growth potential. Lightchain AI Disrupting Blockchain Norms Lightchain AI is revolutionizing the blockchain landscape by seamlessly integrating artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance scalability, privacy, and decentralization. Its innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism rewards nodes for executing meaningful AI tasks, promoting energy efficiency and network security. Central to its architecture is the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), designed to handle complex AI computations, enabling developers to create advanced, data-driven decentralized applications (dApps). Currently in its presale phase, Lightchain AI has garnered significant attention, raising over $10.6 million with tokens priced at $0.00525. This strong investor interest underscores confidence in its potential to become a leading player in the AI-blockchain integration space. Why Shiba Inu Is Losing Steam Shiba Inu (SHIB) has gone down a lot, falling ͏around 90% since it peak in late October 2021. Why the sharp fall? It comes to a few main problems. First, SHIB’s big token amount of almost 589 trillion makes the wish of reaching $1 for each token very unlikely—it would need a crazy market value of $589 trillion! Second, its actual use is small, with less than 100 shops taking it as a payment keeping it stuck in the area of guesswork. To make things worse, new meme coins and fresh projects are taking the show, leaving SHIB having a hard time to stay important. With troubles like these its clear SHIB has a tough fight to keep its speed and market place. Mathematical Potential Why Lightchain AI Buzz Is Justified Lightchain AI has the potential to transform modest investments into significant returns. For example, an initial investment of $500 at a token price of $0.00525 would secure approximately 95,238 LCAI tokens. If the price grows moderately to $0.50, that investment could increase to $47,619. With a more ambitious target of $1 per token, the same $500 could grow to an impressive $95,238. This combination of affordability and strong growth potential has positioned Lightchain AI as a standout investment opportunity for 2025 and beyond. As interest continues to grow, it’s clear why many are buzzing about the potential of Lightchain AI to deliver life-changing financial returns.

During this price rally, Santiment reports a significant network development with bullish indications for the largest cryptocurrency. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Forecast Of $150,000 ‘Too Low’ Amid Rising Adoption, Crypto Trader Says Ash Tiwari 1 hour ago Bitcoin Whale Wallets Heading For 18,000 In a new post on X, prominent blockchain analytics firm Santiment provided a live update on the Bitcoin market amid the current uptrend. Notably, Bitcoin produced another robust positive trading week making a near full-price rebound from its correction in late December. The BTC market was particularly bullish on Friday as prices surged by over 7% to trade as high as $105,970. Interstingly, Santiment reports that the number of whale wallets holding at least 100 BTC had increased to 17,799 right before Bitcoin hit this one-month high price milestone. This development is particularly important as an increase in Bitcoin whales signals accumulation which is a common bullish signal. Considering that this accumulation is occurring in price zones near Bitcoin’s current all-time of 108,268, it can be inferred that large BTC holders are highly expectant of significant price gains leading to a new price discovery. Interestingly, this trend supports the presently strong bullish sentiments around Bitcoin driven by multiple factors most notably expectations of US pro-crypto policies. With the inauguration of Donald Trump less than three days away, investors are hopeful the Republican will implement his promises to the crypto community which include but are not limited to the national Bitcoin reserve, and the overturn of the SAB 121 policy among others. In addition, BTC investors are also bullish on the performances of the Spot Bitcoin ETFs following an impressive debut year during which they recorded $37.10 billion in net cumulative total net inflow. For 2025, the President of the ETF Store, Nate Geraci predicts the Spot Bitcoin ETFs will permanently accumulate more net assets than physical gold ETFs, which would translate to significant gains for the premier cryptocurrency in terms of price and adoption. BTC Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $104,174 following a 3.19% price increase in the past 24 hours. On the same positive note, the asset’s daily trading volume currently stands at $65.88 billion following its 16.27% gain. Investors should note that Bitcoin’s relative strength index is currently at 69.16 heading for the overbought zone. Therefore, there is potential for a reversal soon. With a market cap of 2.06 trillion, Bitcoin remains the largest digital asset accounting for 56.4% of the total crypto market cap.

Is Ripple positioning the $XRP Ledger to take on BlackRock? With over $10 trillion dollars under management, the world's largest asset manager is beginning to focus on Ripple's latest expansion: tokenization. Here is a strategic breakdown of this next phase for $XRP : pic.twitter.com/L9cdUt0hDx — Austin King (@0xASK) January 18, 2025 He highlighted that the world’s largest asset manager blackrock blackrock - Fintech Solution Advisory Investment platform is focusing on tokenization, and Ripple is positioned to lead this charge. He also shared a strategic breakdown of this next phase for XRP. Notably, crypto giants like coinbase coinbase - support@coinbase.com Wallet Centralised Exchange and binance binance - binance@miceneurol.com Centralised Exchange are losing ground as $7B in trading volume moved onchain in the past 24 hours. The main challenge? A lack of quality assets from traditional finance. This is where Ripple and Omni come in. Ripple is already making strides with RLUSD , a tokenized dollar, and Omni’s role is to enable seamless expansion of these tokenized assets across the onchain economy. Omni is designed for connecting chains, something $XRP Ledger currently lacks. What is the problem with the onchain economy today? He remarked that the primary roadblock is the lack of quality assets from the traditional financial system. And this is the key opportunity for Ripple to introduce high-quality tokenized assets into this open and global financial system. However, he noted that the missing piece in the XRP Ledger is the ability to connect with other blockchain networks. While XRP Ledger is optimized for payments and tokenization, it lacks cross-chain interoperability. On the other hand, he pointed out that OMNI is designed specifically to enable seamless connections between different blockchains. Combining XRP Ledger’s strengths with OMNI’s cross-chain capabilities could overhaul the entire onchain economy, allowing for more fluid interactions between different blockchain ecosystems. He noted that Ripple has taken the first step by tokenizing the dollar with RLUSD. Omni’s next move is enabling the seamless, permissionless spread of RLUSD across the onchain economy. It is already achieved internally and will soon be available to the public. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : XRP Price Prediction For January 18 , The Ultimate Goal? The goal is to tokenize the multi-trillion-dollar securities market, bringing massive value into the digital space. RLUSD is just the first step, and as Ripple tokenizes more assets, OmniNetwork will help distribute them throughout the onchain economy. This partnership between Ripple and OmniNetwork will lay the foundation for a completely new digital financial system. He noted that what we’re seeing today with billions in on-chain volume will be nothing compared to what’s coming. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Rexas Finance (RXS) is rising as a notable contender, drawing investor interest with its creative strategy and impressive presale performance. With the presale now in its eleventh stage, a question emerges: Can RXS achieve the explosive growth of Shiba Inu (SHIB) and provide investors with 10,000% returns? Here’s how even a small investment today could significantly increase in value. Revolutionizing Asset Ownership with Blockchain Rexas Finance (RXS) is reshaping how real-world assets integrate with blockchain technology. The platform’s core innovation lies in tokenizing tangible assets like real estate and gold, providing global access and unprecedented ownership opportunities. With Rexas Finance, investors can purchase fractional or full ownership of assets worldwide with just a click, enabling passive income opportunities. Imagine an investor in Asia earning returns from a stake in a European property. This seamless experience is made possible through features like the Rexas Token Builder, which allows users to transform their assets into tradable tokens effortlessly. Additionally, the Rexas Launchpad offers a powerful avenue for fundraising, enabling users to secure investments for tokenized projects, from business ventures to real estate. The ecosystem doesn’t stop there. Rexas Estate provides a marketplace for tokenized properties, while advanced tools such as Rexas Quickmint Bot, GenAI, and AI Shield enhance accessibility and security. By bridging blockchain with tangible assets, Rexas Finance is breaking down traditional barriers and revolutionizing ownership and trading. Could Rexas Finance Mirror the Success of Shiba Inu? Much like Shiba Inu, which rose to become one of the top meme coins to buy and meme-inspired appeal, Rexas Finance is positioned to surprise the market. Its presale success is already comparable to SHIB’s early momentum, offering a chance for early investors to secure tokens at a low price with the potential for significant returns. Could RXS balloon to a 10,000% increase like Shiba Inu did in its heyday? The possibility is very real, and here’s why: RXS, the native token of Rexas Finance, is built on the reliable ERC-20 standard. Its total supply is capped at 1 billion tokens, with a carefully structured allocation plan to ensure sustainability: 42.5% for presale 22.5% for staking 15% for liquidity The remainder is distributed strategically across marketing, giveaways, and team allocations. The presale of the RWA tokens has already proven to be a game-changer. By prioritizing public involvement over venture capital, Rexas Finance has raised $37,377,857 to date, with $33,125,000 generated from the first ten presale stages alone. Currently priced at $0.175, the eleventh stage continues to gain momentum. A $1 million giveaway further boosts community engagement, offering 20 winners $50,000 each in USDT. Rexas Finance Tokenomics Building Credibility and Trust Like Shiba Inu RXS’s visibility and credibility are bolstered by listings on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, ensuring access to millions of potential investors. A CertiK audit further reinforces trust in the token’s smart contracts, addressing investor concerns about security. The upcoming launch on three Tier-1 exchanges promises to elevate RXS’s market presence significantly. With projections indicating that RXS could reach double-digit figures by early 2025, the urgency to invest at presale prices is palpable. Its innovative ecosystem, strong fundamentals, and growing community support position Rexas Finance as a standout in the crypto space. Could Rexas Finance’s Growth Outpace Shiba Inu? While Shiba Inu earned its fame through a strong community and viral status, Rexas Finance offers a combination of viral presale success and real-world utility. The growing excitement around the project suggests that the early-stage cryptocurrency could provide even more value to early investors. With the potential for RXS to mirror Shiba Inu’s rise or surpass it, investors should be paying close attention. Final Thoughts Rexas Finance (RXS) is intriguing to both experienced investors and beginners. Its presale achievements, innovative features, and practical uses distinguish it in a growing competitive market. Although comparisons to Shiba Inu emphasize its remarkable potential, RXS provides more than mere hype; it is supported by genuine utility and innovation. For investors seeking the next cryptocurrencies to buy , RXS presents a compelling case. Even a small investment today could lead to extraordinary returns as Rexas Finance continues its journey toward becoming a dominant player in the cryptocurrency market.

The Recent XRP Price Glitches On January 16, 2025, X user “The ISO GOAT” shared an image from their Edge Wallet showing XRP priced at $81.91, reflecting a 2811.5% increase. The user remarked, “It’s a hiccup that got corrected quickly, but it was glorious for a minute.” Shortly after, another user, Jeremy Swans, shared a screenshot from a crypto portfolio tracker showing XRP at $95.57, up 3334.93%. These price anomalies have fueled speculation about potential market shifts. Others in the community also confirmed the glitch. One user shared a screenshot showing the glitch affecting all the top cryptocurrencies, with Ethereum at $38,312 and Solana at $6,071. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Price glitches like these have occurred periodically for XRP, particularly in 2024. They were mostly attributed to errors in data feeds or wallet systems. However, given XRP’s bullish trajectory in late 2024 and early 2025, many people think such glitches are a precursor to further gains. XRP’s price surge during this period pushed it as high as $3.39, its highest level since 2018, and the surge is set to continue, as one notable analyst has predicted that the asset can hit $15 by March 10. Community members are often divided over these anomalies. Many dismiss them as technical errors that should be ignored as they do not affect the asset. One user commented, “Are just that, glitches. Don’t overthink them.” However, others suggest they may reflect underlying liquidity trends, system tests by exchanges, or XRP’s “real price” that will soon be revealed. The timing of these glitches, occurring during a period of heightened market activity for XRP, has only added to the speculation. As one commenter put it, “It’s not a glitch, it’s a glimpse into what’s coming for XRP in the near future!” With Donald Trump about to become U.S. President again, many in the community are convinced that the digital asset could hit targets as high as these glitches and even more.

He allegedly orchestrated a rug pull scheme that defrauded investors in the Game Coin token (GME). Zhu will pay nearly $823K if the court approves the commission’s motion for final judgment. The SEC claims that Zhu misappropriated $553K from GME investors by using his role as the project’s blockchain engineer for personal gain. The agency suggests that GME was sold as a security via liquidity pools. Eric Zhu could be one of the last cases the SEC handles in Gary Gensler’s term as the commission’s chair. GME developer to pay $823K in SEC settlement According to the release , Eric Zhu is an experienced blockchain engineer and was hired to perform coding work for GME. The token was offered and sold to the public through liquidity pools for trading crypto assets. If the court approves the settlement, Zhu will pay $553K in restitution, $120K in prejudgment interest, and a $150K civil penalty without admitting guilt. A person who deposits a crypto asset token pair into a liquidity pool receives liquidity provider tokens (LP tokens). In the case of a rug pull, liquidity providers suddenly withdraw their funds, which destabilizes the token’s value and causes losses for investors. The SEC alleges that was the scheme Zhu ran with GME tokens. The SEC mentioned that Game Coin and its founders depicted that liquidity was locked in a social media post. It suggested that LP tokens were “locked” and could not be used by the issuers or other insiders. The commission found that certain LP tokens were moved to a blockchain address under Zhu’s control. The blockchain engineer kept those tokens unlocked and later used them to perform a rug pull. The SEC added that Zhu sold $553,000 worth of tokens, which caused a 12% decline in GME price. The final act for top SEC officials The resolution of Eric Zhu’s case could be one of the last wins for the watchdog in the Gary Gensler regime. However, the outgoing chair has advised the commission to intensify its regulation of the crypto sector, mainly on altcoins. Donald Trump’s historic win in the US presidential elections proved to be a game changer for the digital assets industry. Trump has nominated Paul Atkins, who is sympathetic to the crypto cause, to be the new SEC Chairman. BTC price has surged by over 50% in the last 90 days, hitting the $108k mark. The commission has also announced that the Acting Director of the Division of Enforcement, Sanjay Wadhwa, will also depart from the agency by January 31, 2025.

The altcoin will turn bullish in the next two or three weeks, claims analyst Ali Martinez. ADA can skyrocket to $6, Martinez said, while highlighting previous market movements. ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, has dropped 5.11% in the past 24 hours, trading at $1.07 at the time of writing. Despite its decline, ADA remains the ninth-largest digital asset with a market capitalization of $37.74 billion, although it is still down 65.63% from its all-time high of $3.10. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that ADA reached a daily high of $1.16, attempting to flip the $1.10 resistance into a support level. However, the attempt failed, resulting in a bearish breakout. If the $1 level does not hold, the next significant support lies at $0.90. Analyst Predicts ADA Rally to $6 While ADA’s short-term outlook appears challenging, analyst Ali Martinez suggests a potential rally to $6 could be on the horizon.

Specifically, Solana has broken out of the bullish cup-and-handle pattern , signaling a potential target of $4,700 based on the formation’s historical implications, according to a projection shared by cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez in an X post on January 18. SOL price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Ali_charts The cup-and-handle pattern resembles a rounded “cup” followed by a smaller “handle” dip. It signifies a period of consolidation before a breakout, reflecting growing buying pressure after a prolonged correction. When the price breaks above the resistance level at the “rim” of the cup, it often leads to a strong upward move. In Solana’s case, the breakout occurred after the asset reclaimed the $220 mark, validating the bullish setup. Notably, although Solana has the potential to rally, the price target can be considered ambitious. It would elevate SOL’s market cap to $2.29 trillion, making it the top digital asset—provided Bitcoin ( BTC ) sees minimal growth. The breakout projection comes when Solana is witnessing increased short-term bullish momentum, which aligns with the broader cryptocurrency market. These positive sentiments have been heightened by optimism surrounding Donald Trump’s upcoming inauguration on January 20. Reports indicate that, once in office, Trump will likely issue an executive order related to cryptocurrencies . SOL short-term price target For short-term analysis, pseudonymous cryptocurrency trading expert Sheldon The Sniper highlighted in an X post on January 18 that Solana could hit a record high within the $500 to $600 range. The analysis noted that SOL’s first major target lies at $324, corresponding to the 1.618 Fibonacci extension. A sustained move beyond this level could push SOL toward $416, aligning with the 2.618 Fibonacci extension. The next significant level for those eyeing higher gains is $504, marked by the 3.618 extension. Beyond these targets, the analyst suggested Solana could climb into the $500 to $600 range or even higher. SOL price analysis chart. Source: TradingView In line with possible high targets for Solana, as reported by Finbold, trading expert Alan Santana projected the token could hit $300 in the coming months based on its bullish technical setup. Notably, market attention has shifted to Solana after Trump unveiled the TRUMP meme coin built on its network. To this end, due to high withdrawal volumes, Binance temporarily halted SOL withdrawals through the Solana network after the TRUMP launch diverted liquidity from other tokens.

However, top altcoins such as Ethereum and XRP have recorded a bearish action during this period, highlighting a mixed action in the crypto space. Considering the present market sentiments, is this the right time to invest in these crypto tokens?

On January 18, Trump’s official social media accounts, including X and Truth Social, announced a Solana-based memecoin dubbed the “Official Trump (TRUMP) Memecoin.” The posts, encouraging followers to “celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!” raised eyebrows, with the crypto community debating whether the accounts were compromised or if the posts were genuine. Within hours of the announcement, TRUMP soared to a staggering $9 billion market cap, surpassing well-known memecoins like Pepe and Bonk. At the time of publication, the token was trading at $8.41, and Solana’s price experienced a 4.12% surge, reaching $228. Hack or Hype? Industry Divided The legitimacy of the posts has sparked a heated debate. Some crypto experts speculate that Trump’s accounts may have been hacked, warning of potential fallout for the crypto market. Max Schwartman, CEO of BecauseBitcoin, cautioned that if the posts were unauthorized, it could dampen Trump’s crypto-friendly stance just as he prepares to take office. However, Schwartman added, “If it’s legitimate, things are about to get absolutely out of control this quarter.” Other commentators expressed skepticism about the lack of official confirmation. JRNY Crypto questioned why Trump’s advisors haven’t verified the project, suggesting the absence of such assurances adds to the confusion. Meanwhile, Edward Morra, a crypto trader, predicted a potential market sell-off tied to the uncertainty, stating the situation “will end bad in one way or another.” Solana Surges Amid TRUMP Memecoin Mania While doubts persist, some in the crypto space sense the posts are genuine but remain cautious. Crypto commentator “Daniel Got Hits” admitted having a “gut feeling” that the posts were legitimate but stated , “I’m not touching this thing with a ten-foot pole.” Market dynamics reflect the frenzy. Analyst Will Clemente noted an unusual surge in Solana’s price, describing how investors are panic-selling other assets to capitalize on the TRUMP memecoin hype. “I’ve never seen anything like this,” Clemente said, calling the market’s reaction unprecedented. The timing of the posts adds to the intrigue, with Trump expected to sign an executive order designating cryptocurrency as a national priority shortly after taking office.

As reported by ETF Store President Nate Geraci, the proposed ETFs include leveraged, inverse, and futures options. According to the January 17 filing , ProShares is seeking approval for investment products under the tickers Short XRP ETF, Ultra XRP ETF, and UltraShort XRP ETF. The submissions come just days before SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s departure from office on January 20. Industry stakeholders believe new chair Paul Atkins, supported by Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies, will approve more ETFs. Companies to explore new XRP, SOL investment options Earlier today, Nate Geraci posted on his X account that several entities have filed for crypto ETFs in the last 48 hours, including VanEck, Canary, CoinShares, Oasis, and ProShares. While most of the companies submitted one request each, the latter applied for four investment vehicles, three of which are tied to Ripple’s XRP. A futures XRP ETF will allow investors to speculate on the coin’s price movements without owning the cryptocurrency directly, while leveraged ETFs will amplify XRP’s daily returns, potentially doubling or tripling their gains. Inverse ETFs will offer investors opportunities to profit from XRP’s price declines, via derivatives trading. Geraci also revealed that ProShares has applied for Solana futures ETFs. ETF analyst James Seyffart questioned the feasibility of the filing, pointing out that Coinbase had limited liquidity on its SOL futures market. “It’s interesting because there aren’t CME futures yet, and I’m not sure if Coinbase SOL futures are liquid enough,” Seyffart remarked. XRP ETF applications submitted so far ProShares’ filings follow earlier efforts to launch XRP ETFs, dating back to the end of last year. In October 2024, Bitwise Asset Management submitted a Form S-1 to the SEC for a spot XRP ETF. This was then followed by 21Shares in November, which proposed its Core XRP Trust, and another from WisdomTree in December. However, financial regulators have yet to greenlight any of the applications. The applications arrive during a period of heightened positivity within the crypto industry fueled by Gary Gensler’s resignation from the SEC. Gensler wasn’t even out of the building for 5 minutes and the ETF industry unloaded a massive crypto filing frenzy. Half a dozen so far. https://t.co/YyNik32CWp — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 17, 2025 If approved by the US Senate, industry experts predict that incoming SEC chair Paul Atkins’ leadership could create a more favorable regulatory environment, potentially expediting the approval process for cryptocurrency ETFs. XRP shows signals of upward momentum XRP’s price has been setting up a bullish trend in the past few days, fueled by rumors that the US is considering adding the coin to its reserves. Since the beginning of December 2024, XRP has been consolidating between the $2-$2.5 levels, but market activity this week pushed its price beyond the $3 mark. The cryptocurrency recorded a 30.78% rise over the past week, a 28.28% gain over the past month, and an impressive 446.24% increase over the past year, per Coingecko data . On the daily trading chart, XRP has exhibited a consolidation phase around the $3.10 level, with subdued trading volumes that have gone down by almost 45% in the last 24 hours. Analysts note potential retracements to support zones at $2.8 and $3, which could present buying opportunities for traders.

Recovery Signs for Aptos & Bullish Sentiment for DOGE,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-welcomes-cardano-exec-marius-bock-recovery-signs-for-aptos-bullish-sentiment-for-doge/,"Choosing the best cryptocurrency to purchase in 2025 is tricky, yet three particular coins demonstrate promising signs. Current Aptos (APT) market trends hint at a possible rebound, despite a recent 9% decrease in its value over the last week, finding support at the 0.618 Fibonacci level. Similarly, the robust Dogecoin bullish sentiment is evident, with 81.05% of Binance traders opting to maintain their long positions. In the meantime, BlockDAG (BDAG) has enhanced its leadership by recruiting Marius Bock as its new Lead Project Manager. Boasting over 25 years of experience in blockchain and prior involvement with Cardano, Bock’s addition is poised to significantly benefit the team. With BlockDAG approaching its mainnet launch and its presale nearly hitting $600 million, the anticipated $1 value for BDAG seems increasingly attainable. Latest Aptos (APT) Market Trends Recently, Aptos has undergone substantial losses, decreasing by 9% this past week and 36% in the last month, paralleling Bitcoin’s performance. Nonetheless, the latest Aptos market trends suggest a resurgence might be on the horizon. The support at the 0.618 Fibonacci level provides a strong base, with crucial resistance points at $13, $19, and $28. Should market conditions improve, Aptos could experience an upward trajectory. The broader crypto market’s revival might also contribute to boosting APT’s value, making it vital to keep a close eye on the Aptos market trends. Dogecoin (DOGE) Bullish Sentiment in Debate A majority of traders on Binance remain upbeat about Dogecoin, with 81.05% holding long positions, reflecting a solid Dogecoin bullish sentiment. Conversely, only 18.95% are speculating on a price drop. The long-to-short ratio stands at 4.28, signaling a growing confidence. Despite a slight 1% decrease in Dogecoin’s price following a 10% rise a few days earlier, the positive funding rate indicates that traders anticipate an increase in value. Although it encountered a minor setback, the prevailing Dogecoin bullish sentiment suggests that more traders betting against DOGE are facing losses. BlockDAG Gains Momentum as Marius Bock Joins the Team BlockDAG has enhanced its project management with the addition of Marius Bock as Lead Project Manager. Bringing over 25 years of experience in fintech and blockchain, Marius is well-equipped to propel BlockDAG forward as it approaches its anticipated mainnet launch in 2025. His extensive background with prominent figures in the cryptocurrency industry aligns perfectly with BlockDAG’s goals to innovate blockchain scalability and functionality. Marius’s significant roles include spearheading wallet enhancements for Cardano and contributing to projects at Fundamo (a Visa subsidiary), IBM, Naspers, and ACI Worldwide. With the presale crossing the $181.5 million mark, BlockDAG is drawing attention. This success, combined with solid foundational work, has led experts to foresee BDAG reaching $1 soon. Currently priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, this opportunity is ripe for those looking to get involved early. Those who joined during batch 1 have already seen their holdings increase by 2380%! As BlockDAG gears up for its mainnet launch, its robust leadership and Marius Bock’s expertise are sure to achieve significant milestones. The mix of cutting-edge technology, a seasoned team, and the potential for strong returns positions BlockDAG as the top crypto to buy in 2025. With batch 27 nearing completion and only a few more available, acting now is crucial before BDAG’s value skyrockets. Final Thoughts on the Top Crypto to Buy in 2025 APT may be set for a comeback if it maintains key support, with the Aptos (APT) market trends indicating a potential rise. Concurrently, the enduring Dogecoin bullish sentiment suggests traders anticipate an increase in its value. Yet, for those targeting the top crypto to buy in 2025, BlockDAG emerges as the front-runner as it edges closer to the $1 mark each day.

Notably, the BitMEX co-founder spotlighted the TRUMP token launch, calling it the start of a “political memecoin market.” As a result, market participants are now thoroughly monitoring the newly launched token, as its remarkable growth promptly post-launch aided it in securing the 4th spot in terms of global meme coins’ market cap. BitMEX’s Arthur Hayes Sparks Buzz With “Political Memecoin Market” Comment In an X post dated January 18, Arthur Hayes reiterated the 47th U.S. president’s TRUMP token announcement, saying, “This is the launch of the political memecoin market.” Further, the American co-founder goes on to add, “any politician who isn’t afraid of knowing what the people think in real-time will launch their own memecoin.” These statements underscore the beginning of a new era and segment of cryptocurrencies, ‘political memecoin.’ However, Hayes says that “these tokenomics are fugazi,” hinting that these coins may be extremely unreliable. But, the chances of these coins hitting a $100 billion market cap prevail amid the current market trends, per the BitMEX co-founder. Overall, these statements amid the launch of a new meme token on Solana have gained significant traction across the crypto industry. TRUMP Token: Talk Of The Crypto Town In a riveting turn of events, President-elect Donald Trump recently announced the launch of TRUMP meme coin , a token on Solana. Promptly after its inception into the crypto realm, the token has claimed 4th rank, standing right after Pepe Coin in terms of market cap. Notably, CoinGape reported that the newly launched token even aided traders in making millions within a day of its launch. Also, accumulations for the same have been on a constant spike, indicating that further price gains for the token may be imminent. Moreover, in light of Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration, which is set to take place on January 20, market sentiments surrounding the new Solana meme crypto’s future action remain highly bullish. It’s also worth mentioning that Binance had to suspend SOL withdrawals amid the new token’s launch on the network, which further sparked market discussions over the coin’s rising popularity. At the time of reporting, the Official TRUMP crypto exchanged hands at $22.15, witnessing a staggering 241% uptick intraday. The cryptocurrency’s 24-hour low and high were $6.24 and $24.50, respectively. In conclusion, Arthur Hayes’ statements on a “political memecoin market’ may be true, as seen by the new Republican-backed coin’s recent rising dominance across the broader sector.

Why is BTC suddenly crashing today? This bearish development comes when the crypto market is confused about the recently launched TRUMP meme coin . Why is Bitcoin Price Crashing Today? Bitcoin price today trades at No data found for bitcoin on 10 minutes ago after dropping No data found for bitcoin on 10 minutes ago%. This short-term pullback comes after BTC registered a 19% gain since the January 13 low. Due to this sudden surge, investors who bought the dip are likely offloading or booking profits, which explains the small retracement. As a result of the recent uptrend drop, Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) also registered No data found for ethereum on 10 minutes ago% and 17.83% gains, respectively. Solana (SOL), on the other hand, rose 10% today due to Trump’s meme coin. *bitcoin price updated as of No data found for bitcoin on 10 minutes ago Short-Term Holders Rush to Book Profits Santiment shows that the 7-day MVRV indicator hovers around the danger zone, which short-term investors often book profits. The 7-day Moving Average (MA) of this indicator drowns the noise and provides a good data point to identify where Bitcoin price could reverse. During consolidations, when the 7-day MA of this indicator reaches 3%, a reversal happens. Currently, BTC’s recent 18% rally has generated a similar top signal, hinting that BTC is primed for another correction. Bitcoin Price vs. 7-day MVRV chart During uptrends, these corrections are short-lived and are often reversed due to the buying pressure. Let’s take a look at the technical analysis and what it forecasts for BTC in the mid-to-long-term. BTC Price Analysis: What’s Next For Bitcoin? The four-hour chart shows Bitcoin has overcome the volume profile’s range high at $99.8K and set up a top at a key resistance level of $105.7K. Typically, when the price moves out of a range, it tends to trigger an impulsive move until it creates another consolidative range. Hence, Bitcoin price forecast notes that the recent breakout above $99.8K will lead to a leg up to a new all-time high. Due to the weekend, profit-taking might lead to a pullback into the buy zone, extending from $100.4K to $99.1K. If buyers defend this retracement, BTC’s value could inflate, targeting a new all-time high (ATH). BTC/USDT 4-hour chart Fibonacci Tool Forecasts Key Levels To Sell BTC In the past two months, Bitcoin created a high of $108,421 and a low of $89,100. Using the Fibonacci tool to these two swing points reveals a target of $120,362.3. However, investors should watch for a bounce around the $100K level for an impulsive move to the upside. The key levels to book profits or sell BTC are $100K, $115K & $120K. These areas are where investors should watch for strong reversals or exhaustion that leads to reversal. Conclusion In conclusion, Bitcoin’s sudden crash comes as no surprise, given the recent surge and short-term holders’ eagerness to book profits. While the 7-day MVRV indicator suggests a potential reversal, the Fibonacci tool forecast and technical analysis indicate a bullish outlook for Bitcoin in the mid-to-long term. As the market navigates the current volatility, investors should keep a close eye on key levels, including $100K, $115K, and $120K, to capitalize on potential reversals or impulsive moves to the upside.

According to authorities, the scheme started in 2017 after Parker discovered a loophole that allowed him to steal money from the cryptocurrency trading website. He allegedly used the stolen funds to support his lavish lifestyle. Parker, alongside other co-conspirators, used the loophole to siphon money from the website, stealing funds worth £20 million in credits over the next three months. Authorities claimed that the funds from the illicit act were laundered by Parker’s corrupt financial advisor Stephen Boys, who worked with the Winster Court in Clayton-le-Moors. Parker, who discovered the glitch, went on to include others who were integral to the affairs of the gang. Lancashire police investigation uncovers Bitcoin fraud ring According to authorities , the Bitcoin fraud ring spent the money from its affairs lavishly. For instance, people in the streets were gifted £5,000 gift cards, and Parker, who is originally from Blackpool, gave new cars to people he met at the pub. During the investigations, the police recovered 445 BTC, worth £22 million at the time. Other than the BTC, the police also seized luxury watches, houses, exotic cars, and several designer goods, including a wine cooler worth £600 from the group. They also recovered more than £1 million in several bank accounts. Lancashire police said it worked with several international law enforcement, including authorities in Australia, Finland, and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to apprehend the criminals. According to the police, Parker died in 2021 before prosecution, while his co-conspirators were sentenced in January 2023. During the trial, Parker’s financial advisor, Boys revealed that he took £1 million in a suitcase to purchase a villa from some Russians he met in the back office of an estate agent. Boys also said he had paid some corrupt officials funds totaling £60,000 to carry on his laundering activities. Boys was sent to prison for six years for money laundering. Bitcoin fraud ring members sentenced to jail Other members of the group were also sentenced for their role in the criminal operation. Jordan Robinson of Fleetwood was sentenced to eight and a half years in prison. He was guilty of three counts of conspiracy to commit fraud, acquisition of criminal property, and converting criminal property. Another member of the group, Kelly Caton of Blackpool, was also jailed for eight and half years on several counts. She was guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud, acquisition of criminal property, and converting criminal property. Meanwhile, James Austin-Beddoes of Lytham received a suspended sentence on the same charges. In the Proceeds of Crime Act hearing at Preston Crown Court on Friday, the police economic crime unit revealed that it seized assets worth £4 million from Robinson, £8 million from Caton, £1,100 from Austin-Beddoes, and £8 million from Parker. The victim lost about £24.5 million to the gang, and the police noted that they have been compensated in full. Due to the surge in the price of the stolen Bitcoins , the seized amount was more than the stolen amount by about £3 million. The proceeds will be split between the courts, Lancashire police, and the Home Office. DS Dave Wainwright of the economic crime unit highlighted the challenges of the investigation. “This has been an extremely challenging investigation which has tested our use of the Proceeds of Crime Act,” he said. He also expressed his happiness at compensating the victim in full, noting that the criminals were unable to benefit from their theft. “I would like to thank colleagues from across the police and CPS who contributed to this outstanding result,” he added.

Cardano (ADA) remains a market favorite, and a new entrant, IntelMarkets (INTL) , has steadily clawed its way to the top. Incorporating artificial intelligence into decentralized finance, the IntelMarkets platform is of growing interest among traders and analysts. INTL is expected to climb by 21,000%, making it the most popular altcoin of the year, surpassing the Cardano price. IntelMarkets (INTL): The Disruptive Force in Crypto Trading In the existing difficult conditions within the crypto market, IntelMarkets (INTL) takes its place as an innovative financial leader. INTL is an innovative trading mechanism based on AI, blockchain, and DeFi that sets itself apart from traditional trading platforms. This synergy of two technologies has encouraged the investors and analysts, which contributed to IntelMarkets’ position as the most searched altcoin of 2025. The platform is based on self-learning trading robots, which are capable of analyzing large amounts of data from different sources in real-time. These sophisticated features enable its users to search and trade on arbitrage across various assets. With this breakthrough, INTL is set to bring the next wave of change. With the presale completing in weeks, the project has garnered over $6.7M at $0.082 per token and achieved several significant milestones that speak of trust imposed by the crypto community. Analysts have estimated that INTL has a 21,000% upside potential after becoming listed on Tier-1 exchanges. Another critical element that helped IntelMarkets to achieve success is its development team’s strong background. A team of experts from OpenAI and MIT gives the project credibility and the vital knowledge required to execute the project. ADA-XRP Partnership, Cardano Price Prediction Cardano (ADA) has been particularly popular among the crypto community for its first proof-of-stake blockchain and for its readiness for scaling and permanence. Currently, as of January 2025, ADA is changing hands at $1.12, with the Cardano price increasing by 6.42% in the last 24 hours. Still, it continues to rank in the top ten with a total market capitalization of about $36.51 billion. Nonetheless, ADA has not been able to replicate the Cardano price highs of its peak of $3.10 in September 2021. Recent developments have seen ADA expand with the Hydra update, as over 35% of Cardano SPOs voted in favor of the Plomin Hard Fork. Additionally, the announced partnership with Ripple has had a positive impact on the Cardano price. Analysts are very optimistic about the future of ADA and its developing ecosystem, with some predictions claiming the Cardno price will reach $2. Final Thoughts The crypto market is very dynamic, and with that comes new ways of grabbing a hold of your exponential returns. However, having created a worthy competitor within the sphere, Cardano has demonstrated its worth today, and now the focus is on IntelMarkets as the next breakout star. Led by its AI platform and with a potential 21,000% upside, INTL is ready to revolutionize the field of cryptocurrency trading and provide investors with astounding profit margins. Due to the presales creating much attention now is the time to invest at the lowest price IntelMarkets will ever be.

The SUI target recently moved past the $5 threshold, and observers are focusing on $5.89 as the upcoming checkpoint. This consistent rise prompts traders to consider its capacity for further expansion. In parallel, the Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate has increased 300%, igniting lively debate about supply constraints and the asset’s potential worth. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) has taken a bold step by bringing on Marius Bock, a Cardano project supervisor, in the position of Lead Project Manager. His direction might elevate BlockDAG’s forthcoming mainnet rollout and its $181.5 million presale to fresh peaks. SUI Target: Plotting Fresh Boundaries Above $5 The SUI target has intrigued traders since it broke past $5 on January 10 and 11, then settled near $4.60, marking a 4% uptick for the month. Recent market action suggests the SUI target may push toward the $5.89 range, prompting widespread interest among crypto observers. Charts show ongoing buy momentum and solid support lines, driving talk about where the next SUI target might head. According to some analysts, the token’s repeated pushbacks near $4.50 effectively established a firm foundation for its ongoing climb. Buyers remain optimistic about SUI’s steady trajectory, and many now wonder if the SUI target will stay on track should wider market influences begin to drag. Indicators like the RSI strongly suggest the SUI target can still gain ample ground ahead, assuming the asset continues holding above this crucial threshold. Shiba Inu Burn Rate: Bigger Reductions Ahead? Shiba Inu’s burn rate has shot up by roughly 300% in a short span, triggering mixed opinions within the community. Some contend that a higher Shiba Inu burn rate might trim overall supply and raise value, while others ask if the SHIB Army could refine its process. Official sources point out that developers alone can’t alter the circulating supply, so improving Shibarium’s features remains central. That approach aims to boost the Shiba Inu burn rate using gas fee mechanisms tied to BONE tokens. A recent poll on social platforms shows participants favor a large burn, though specifics vary. Many supporters hope an increased Shiba Inu burn rate may benefit the broader market outlook. BlockDAG Welcomes Marius Bock: A Key Step Forward BlockDAG just stirred excitement by naming Marius Bock as Lead Project Manager, and the buzz is undeniable! Bock, recognized for his Cardano wallet work and stint at Input Output, brings over 25 years of know-how in blockchain, fintech, and enterprise software. His arrival lines up with BlockDAG’s mainnet preparations, and many foresee major steps forward under his watch. The coin, currently priced at $0.0248, is attracting attention as the presale moves into batch 27. Over $181.5 million has been gathered, with 17.9 billion coins sold, giving early backers a noteworthy 2,380% ROI. The team believes Bock’s presence will enhance plans to propel the project to new levels as the mainnet launch draws near. BlockDAG keeps forging collaborations, engaging with its community, and offering buyer incentives for loyalty. Readers eyeing which crypto to buy today may find BlockDAG’s trajectory appealing, buoyed by promising tech strides and an active user base. Bock’s prior roles at IBM and Visa demonstrate his ability to handle large-scale initiatives. His comfort with Agile and Waterfall frameworks fits with BlockDAG’s approach to regular updates and stable advancement. This crypto presale period remains an enticing entry point for seekers of potential returns. Meanwhile, BlockDAG’s commitment to transparency underlines its plan to deliver effective blockchain solutions. Online chatter suggests a growing eagerness for this presale-led campaign. Which Crypto To Buy Today? Plenty of fresh prospects are emerging in the market. The SUI target is in the spotlight following its move beyond $5, with possible progress toward $5.89. Technical signals hint there could be more to come. Concurrently, Shiba Inu’s burn rate has jumped 300%, stirring debate about supply oversight and worth among stakeholders. Still, few projects are grabbing as much attention as BlockDAG right now. The addition of seasoned blockchain professional Marius Bock, known for his Cardano background, has pushed its presale momentum forward. Priced at $0.0248, the project has already secured more than $181.5 million while selling 17.9 billion coins, yielding a hefty 2,380% ROI for early participants.

Earlier this week, the SEC postponed its decision on whether to approve Bitwise’s crypto index ETF until March 3. Bitwise, a leading asset manager for crypto-backed investment funds, seeks to have its Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund (BITW) on the NYSE Arca. The fund tracks the performance of the 10 largest digital assets based on market capitalization and has been trading on the QTCQX Best Market since 2017. You might also like: Crypto will come of age in 2025 | Opinion With a new, crypto-friendly administration in DC taking office on Monday, the decision may rest in the hands of incoming SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins . President-elect Donald Trump wrote about his SEC pick on his Truth Social platform: “ He recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before .” This bodes well for the approval of Bitwise’s index fund. However, a decision in favor of Bitwise won’t come without its opponents. For example, Bartlett Naylor , a financial policy advocate at Public Citizen, expressed concern over the implications of the industry pouring an unprecedented $119 million into political campaigns. He believes these donations come with strings attached and that an overtly pro-crypto SEC would undermine investor protections. “Crypto companies’ unprecedented political spending apparently just bought them control of the nation’s investor protection police,” said Naylor last month. His concerns shouldn’t be discredited outright due to the industry’s well-documented history of scams and sketchy risk management practices. However, a quick dive into Naylor’s views reveals someone ideologically opposed to crypto to his core. Therefore, he is unable to recognize that the crypto industry is vastly different from what it was in 2021. In May, he “strongly urged” members of Congress to vote against President Biden’s Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act simply because the “bill would legitimize cryptocurrency.” Note that this bill, which passed in Congress and is waiting to be voted on in the Senate, would provide a robust regulatory framework with strict registration and compliance requirements. It includes consumer protection safeguards that demand regulators have access to source code, transaction history, economic models, and more. It’s unclear if this legislative act will provide the incoming administration with a template to add and subtract from, as speculation continues regarding what Trump’s policy may look like, and when it will be revealed. However, any regulation that prioritizes integrating digital assets into the mainstream while supporting innovation and providing consumer protections should be broadly welcomed. Although the industry is certainly optimistic about the positive impacts of Trump’s presidency and continues trending upward, crypto will remain volatile until it becomes better integrated with mainstream finance. Progress is being made on bridging digital and traditional financial ecosystems, and as the industry gradually onboards new adopters, crypto indexes like Bitwise will remain beneficial. It would make sense to see crypto indexes garner more interest from retail investors and new users, regardless of how the SEC rules on the Bitwise case in March. While not as popular as many decentralized platforms or centralized exchanges, crypto indexes can cater to both retail and institutional users. They can also simplify the onboarding process for non-crypto natives while providing an effective tool to mitigate risk for a volatile asset class. Take J’JO Finance for example. The platform helps onboard investors with its J’JO35 Index, which automates investing in the top 35 digital assets based on market capitalization, readjusting every month as the tokens fluctuate. This provides investors with reliable assets at minimal risk, a diverse basket of assets, and the freedom and flexibility to not have to worry about studying, analyzing, and monitoring market trends. Since J’JO aims to onboard investors while prioritizing user satisfaction, its product can be accessed for free. Despite those who are still dedicated to spoiling crypto normalization, the industry is powering forward. As it does, new and old users are benefiting from an abundance of investing tools and services that will help expand the industry’s impact and challenge mainstream financial markets. With regulatory clarity expected, crypto indexes have a chance to play an important role in the next chapter of digital assets.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $6.09 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $9.89. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $100 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos recover to its all-time high soon?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $1.32 Market cap $1,360,746,450.08 Trading volume $46,925,282.63 Circulating supply 1,025,381,449.41 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $1.31 24-hour high $1.43 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction (February 17) $1.689 (26.96%) Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.64% 50-day SMA $1.422 14-Day RSI 55.72 Sentiment Bullish Fear & Greed Index 77 (Extreme Greed) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-day SMA $0.900 Tezos price analysis: XTZ falls into the red zone after a bull market – buying opportunity? TL; DR Breakdown XTZ has seen a 5.50% decline in the last 24 hours. The coin’s support is $1.21, and resistance is $1.47. Tezos (XTZ) is currently rangebound between $1.2 – $1.5. On January 18, Tezos (XTZ) is trading at $1.32, with resistance at $1.47 and support at $1.21. Holding above $1.21 is key to avoiding further decline, while a rebound in buying could push the price above $1.50. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ faces rejection as it attempts to break higher levels The XTZ 1-day price analysis shows that the coin trading around $1.33 with resistance near $1.50 and immediate support level established at $1.26 and $1.257. The price faces rejection as it attempts to break higher levels. XTZ faces rejection as it attempts to break higher levels The MACD indicates growing bullish momentum, as the MACD line is crossing above the signal line, suggesting buyers are attempting to regain control. The RSI sits at 49.18, reflecting a balanced market with no clear bias toward buying or selling. This neutrality hints at potential sideways movement or a gradual recovery, depending on market participation. If the price breaks above $1.50, it could signal a bullish shift, while a drop below $1.20 may open the door for further declines. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: Sellers take control of the market The XTZ four-hour price chart shows a bearish reversal after a sustained upside, depicting some rejection close to the upper bollinger band at $1.47. The pullback emphasizes weakening bullish momentum with more sellers entering the market. The Balance of Power (BOP) indicator at -0.77 supports the trend reversal, highlighting prevailing selling pressure. Sellers take control of the market Similarly, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) also indicated weak capital inflow and diminishing buyer interest. Therefore, resistance around the upper bollinger band ($1.47) could hold strong if sellers continue to dominate the market, leading to a decline towards support at $1.21. A breakout above $1.47 is needed to confirm a bullish reversal. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $1.353 SELL SMA 5 $1.326 BUY SMA 10 $1.326 BUY SMA 21 $1.351 SELL SMA 50 $1.422 SELL SMA 100 $1.098 BUY SMA 200 $0.900 BUY Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $1.270 BUY EMA 5 $1.281 BUY EMA 10 $1.308 BUY EMA 21 $1.338 SELL EMA 50 $1.300 BUY EMA 100 $1.162 BUY EMA 200 $1.029 BUY What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? The price analysis shows a market struggling to sustain a bullish momentum, with sellers taking profit at the top. If the sell pressure persists, support at $1.21 then becomes critical in determing the next move for XTZ. A break below this level could result in further decline. On the flip side, renewed buyer interest could push XTZ above $1.47 and we might just see higher highs. For now, the coin remains rangebound between $1.2 – $1.5. Is Tezos a good long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos down? Tezos (XTZ) is down today, falling from $1.42 to $1.32, a 7.02% price drop – a move spurred by seller diposing of their coins and taking profit. XTZ price history Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2.5 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Already, RTX’s value has risen to $0.0217 in its ongoing ICO, with over $3.3 million raised in just three weeks, making it one of the best coins to buy now for a massive rally in 2025. Here’s why smart money investors turn their gaze to RTX over Shiba Inu.

SHIB trades at about $0.00002261 surging over 6% within the past seven days due to bullish sentiment. However, smart money is moving from SHIB to RTX, one of the best coins to buy now, due to its immense utility.

Fortunately, traders won’t have to search for long. This article takes a deep dive into four top cryptos—BlockDAG, Cardano, Hedera, and Dogecoin—analyzing their use cases and growth potential for 2025 to help investors decide which offers the strongest value this year. 1. BlockDAG: Fastest-Growing Crypto with 3932% ROI Potential! The BlockDAG (DAG) Network’s impressive presale performance, raising $181.5 million with 17.9 billion coins sold so far, positions it as one of the best crypto coins to buy in 2025. This success can be attributed to its innovative technology, strong leadership, and strategic partnerships. The network’s unique directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure delivers exceptional speed and scalability. Currently processing 10 blocks per second, BlockDAG aims to surpass 100 blocks per second, offering significantly greater efficiency than traditional blockchains. Its Layer 1 technology also supports smart contracts and secure mining, adding greater value to the platform. BlockDAG has also formed key collaborations, including a recent partnership with HackerEarth , which aims to host global hackathons and build over 200 high-quality dApps across its ecosystem. This partnership highlights the project’s commitment to advancing Web3 innovation. On a foundational front, BlockDAG recently welcomed Marius Bock, former Cardano leader, to the team as Lead Project Manager, further strengthening its leadership. Given its strong fundamentals and the fast-approaching mainnet launch, analysts predict BlockDAG could reach $1 in 2025. The coin has already delivered a 2380% ROI to early buyers. Now, with its current price of $0.0248 in batch 27, this signals a potential 3932% ROI for those who join the presale now! 2. Cardano: Scalability Meets Community Governance Cardano (ADA) stands out as a top layer-1 blockchain, known for its focus on scalability and sustainability. While its price hasn't yet surpassed the 2021 peak, it saw major gains in 2024, hinting at strong potential for 2025. A key factor driving this momentum is the innovative CIP-1694 governance model, which gives Cardano's community control over future developments, with a massive treasury for funding key initiatives. On the tech front, upgrades like Ouroboros Leios and Hydra aim to address scalability challenges, ensuring Cardano remains competitive as blockchain adoption continues to grow. 3. Hedera: Blending Speed, Scalability, & Enterprise Adoption Hedera (HBAR) is a promising cryptocurrency with a near 200% price increase last year, currently priced around $0.29. Known for its unique hashgraph consensus algorithm, Hedera stands out for its speed, scalability, and energy efficiency. It is also governed by a decentralized council, including major players like Google and IBM, providing stability. Hedera's growing developer ecosystem, partnerships with giants like Nvidia and Intel, and collaborations with ServiceNow position it for continued enterprise adoption and innovation, making it one of the best crypto coins to buy in 2025. 4. Dogecoin: Memecoin Ready for Strong 2025 Comeback Wrapping up this roundup of the best crypto coins to buy in 2025 is Dogecoin (DOGE). DOGE could see a strong comeback in 2025, partly thanks to the U.S. government’s D.O.G.E. initiative. While not directly tied to Dogecoin, the initiative’s backing by crypto advocates like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy could create a favorable environment for DOGE. This, combined with growing investor interest and its status as a long-standing memecoin leader, makes DOGE an intriguing option for those looking to capitalize on a potential market rebound in 2025. The Bottom Line All the projects in this list show strong growth potential, making them some of the best crypto coins to buy in 2025 . Cardano’s emphasis on scalability and community governance could fuel significant growth. Hedera’s unique consensus model and expanding partnerships position it for enterprise adoption. Meanwhile, Dogecoin, supported by influential figures and growing investor interest, could see a strong rebound. However, none match BlockDAG’s comprehensive ecosystem and profit potential. With a historic $181.5 million presale and a 2380 ROI already delivered to early holders, BlockDAG remains the hottest presale crypto of the decade. Ultimately, the decision comes down to individual preferences, but focusing on projects with real-world use and steady growth can be a smart way to build a solid crypto portfolio.

Cardano: Balancing Scalability and Community Governance Cardano (ADA) shines as a leading layer-1 blockchain, celebrated for its focus on scalability and environmental sustainability.

Dogecoin: Memecoin Set for a Resilient 2025 Return Completing this list of top crypto coins for 2025 is Dogecoin (DOGE). DOGE may see a robust resurgence in 2025, partly due to the U.S. government’s D.O.G.E. initiative. Though not directly linked to Dogecoin, the initiative's support from crypto enthusiasts like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy could create a favorable climate for DOGE. Coupled with increasing investor interest and its reputation as a leading memecoin, DOGE presents an intriguing opportunity for those looking to leverage a potential market recovery in 2025. Final Thoughts Each project on this list demonstrates significant growth potential, making them some of the best crypto coins to invest in for 2025 . Cardano's focus on scalability and community-driven governance may lead to substantial growth. Hedera's distinctive consensus model and expanding partnerships set it up for enterprise adoption.

However, for more cautious investors seeking stable 2-5x gains, a well-established choice like Solana is almost certain to deliver unless an unforeseen black swan event derails its progress. For those aiming for transformative, skyrocketing returns, Remittix has emerged as a promising utility cryptocurrency ready for significant growth in this bull cycle. Keep reading to understand why analysts are proclaiming Remittix as “the next XRP,” with a potential for 100x returns during its presale. Promising Future for Solana Solidified by Recent Insights Despite recent hurdles for Solana, such as the substantial transfer of 149,999 SOL to Binance that stirred worries about possible selling pressure, Solana remains a foundational element of the layer-1 blockchain landscape. Interest from institutional investors in Solana is on the rise, with firms like Grayscale and 21 Shares filing for Solana ETFs. JPMorgan forecasts that these could draw in $3 billion to $6 billion in capital in their first year if they get the green light. Analysts also point to Solana’s scalability advancements, like the proposed ""lattice based homomorphic hashing function,"" which could further boost its network efficiency as competition among layer-1s intensifies. Adding to the optimistic outlook, reports indicate that President-elect Trump is contemplating including Solana in a US-focused crypto reserve strategy, potentially enhancing its adoption along with Bitcoin. Additionally, the new administration’s plans to deregulate the sector and encourage crypto initiatives further position Solana for long-term success, with the possibility of surpassing Ethereum in the coming years. Solana’s meme ecosystem is also poised for a significant resurgence. As excitement builds around memes like Dogwifhat, Goatseus Maximus, and Chillguy in the weeks ahead, Solana could experience exponential growth from new retail investors entering the market.

However, 2025 has seen the platform face challenges, including dwindling trading volumes and increased competition from rival platforms. As Uniswap grapples with its price woes, traders and investors are shifting focus to innovative projects like Lightchain AI and Hedera (HBAR). Both emerging as potential game-changers, these projects are stealing the spotlight with their groundbreaking technology and real-world applications. Uniswap’s Struggles Case of Growing Pains? Uniswap changed the crypto world with its self-run market maker model, making trading without middlemen possible. But its deep need for the wider DeFi world has linked its success to market trends. The drop in DeFi growth and more contests from Layer 2 answers and rival shops have added to Uniswap's fading charm. Big ga͏s costs and crowded networks on Ethereum, Uniswap's main chain, stay big hurdles for traders. So, buyers are more and more searching for platforms that give not only growth but also different jobs which brings Lightchain AI and Hedera (HBAR) into talk. Lightchain AI Bridging Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence Lightchain AI is redefining the blockchain space by integrating artificial intelligence into decentralized technology. Unlike Uniswap, which focuses solely on DeFi, Lightchain AI targets a broader spectrum of industries, including logistics, renewable energy, and data-driven applications. Its ability to execute AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) positions it as a forward-thinking solution for enterprises and developers. The project’s presale has already raised $11.3 million, reflecting strong investor confidence. Lightchain AI’s unique selling point lies in its emphasis on privacy-first solutions and seamless integration with existing blockchain networks. This flexibility makes it an attractive option for those seeking utility beyond traditional financial applications. Hedera (HBAR) Green and Scalable Blockchain Contender Hedera (HBAR) is another platform catching the attention of Uniswap investors. Known for its energy-efficient Hashgraph consensus algorithm, Hedera offers fast, secure, and scalable solutions for enterprises. Its network boasts near-instant transaction speeds and minimal environmental impact, making it an appealing choice in a market increasingly focused on sustainability. Hedera’s partnerships with global corporations have added credibility to its ecosystem, further fueling its adoption. For investors disillusioned with Uniswap’s struggles, HBAR offers a compelling alternative that combines scalability with enterprise-grade technology. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Yet, 2025 has brought hurdles for the platform, such as reduced trading volumes and heightened competition from other platforms. As Uniswap contends with its pricing difficulties, traders and investors are turning their attention to cutting-edge projects like Lightchain AI and Hedera (HBAR). These initiatives, emerging as potential innovators, are capturing attention due to their revolutionary technology and practical applications. Uniswap's Challenges: A Sign of Growing Pains? Uniswap revolutionized the crypto sphere with its automated market maker model, enabling trades without intermediaries. However, its reliance on the broader DeFi ecosystem has tied its fortunes to market trends. The slowdown in DeFi expansion and rising competition from Layer 2 solutions and alternate exchanges have contributed to Uniswap's waning allure. High gas fees and congested networks on Ethereum, Uniswap's primary blockchain, remain significant obstacles for users. Consequently, traders are increasingly seeking platforms that offer not just growth but also varied functionalities, bringing Lightchain AI and Hedera (HBAR) into the conversation. Lightchain AI: Merging AI with Blockchain Lightchain AI is reshaping the blockchain domain by incorporating artificial intelligence into decentralized systems. Unlike Uniswap's exclusive focus on DeFi, Lightchain AI aims at a wider array of sectors, such as logistics, renewable energy, and data-centric applications. Its capacity to run AI-driven decentralized applications (dApps) positions it as an innovative choice for businesses and developers. The project's presale has already garnered $11.3 million, indicating robust investor trust. Lightchain AI's distinct advantage lies in its focus on privacy-first solutions and smooth integration with existing blockchain ecosystems. This adaptability makes it appealing for those looking for utility beyond traditional financial purposes. Hedera (HBAR): A Sustainable and Scalable Blockchain Option Hedera (HBAR) is another platform gaining interest among Uniswap investors. Its Hashgraph consensus algorithm, known for energy efficiency, offers rapid, secure, and scalable enterprise solutions. The network's nearly instantaneous transaction speeds and low environmental footprint make it a desirable option in a market increasingly concerned with sustainability. Hedera's collaborations with global businesses have enhanced its ecosystem's credibility, further boosting its adoption.

Ripple,https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-lawyer-reveals-how-trump-memecoin-launch-affect-sec-v-ripple/,"Donald Trump’s TRUMP memecoin, which gained $8 billion within hours of launch, has sparked criticism from the Ripple community. Experts analyze the potential impact of TRUMP memecoin’s launch on the XRP lawsuit. XRP lawyer Bill Morgan criticized Donald Trump for his memecoin launch that recently made ripples in the crypto market. While the XRP community awaits the imminent conclusion of the XRP lawsuit, Trump’s involvement in memecoin launch has drawn controversies. TRUMP Memecoin To Impact XRP Lawsuit, Says Lawyer In a recent X post, XRP attorney Bill Morgan raised concerns over the impact of Trump’s TRUMP meme token on the SEC v. Ripple battle. As per Morgan, though Trump holds “presidential immunity,” his involvement in the launch and promotion of a speculative token highlights the need for clear regulations in the crypto space. Hard to see how the SEC v Ripple appeal continues when the soon to be inaugurated President issues and promotes his own speculative meme coin. Then again he will have presidential immunity. https://t.co/oZOgZqqxVp — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) January 18, 2025 Notably, the incoming President’s promotion of the memecoin is unprecedented and has sparked widespread concern among crypto enthusiasts. Addressing the potential implications of Trump’s move, the lawyer stated, “Hard to see how the SEC v Ripple appeal continues when the soon to be inaugurated President issues and promotes his own speculative meme coin.” Will the Ripple-SEC Legal War End Under the Trump Admin? The XRP community has been anticipating the end of the 4-year legal war between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Trump’s crypto policies and the appointment of crypto-friendly candidates to the key administrative roles have sparked optimism within the community. SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation and Paul Atkin’s succession in particular have further fueled excitement, invoking speculations of a new regulatory era. Recently, the topic of XRP lawsuit settlement got worsened as rumors spread around a clash between Ripple and Trump. Reports stated that Trump criticized Ripple for supporting Kamala Harris during the election campaigns. However, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty dismissed the rumors and wrote on X, “The rumors published by this 3rd-tier crypto rag are pure fiction.” TRUMP Token Boosts XRP Rally Following Trump’s re-election in November, XRP surged from its lows, triggered by anticipations of regulatory amendments and XRP lawsuit settlement. For the first time since 2018, XRP broke past the crucial $3 point on Friday, ahead of Trump’s inauguration on Monday. As of press time, XRP is trading at $3.17, marking a monthly rise of 31%. Despite a marginal fall of 3% over the last 24 hours, the token has seen a notable surge of 31% in a week. The post XRP Lawsuit: Lawyer Reveals How Trump’s Memecoin Launch Affect SEC v.

Remittix: Revolutionizing Global Remittances with Innovation and Accessibility The global remittance market is vast, handling trillions of dollars annually.

Ronin Network Launches $10 Million Developer Grant Amid Ethereum’s Bearish Struggles Ethereum continues to face bearish pressures but the growing adoption of blockchain technology paints a promising future. Numerous firms are investing heavily in advancing digital ledger systems and Ronin Network, an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), has taken a bold step with a $10 million grant program aimed at empowering its community developers. Announced on January 16 via Ronin’s official X handle, the initiative underscores a commitment to enhancing blockchain capabilities and attracting talented developers to the ecosystem. The $10 million fund will be strategically allocated among developers and waypoints, fueling innovation within the Ronin ecosystem. This announcement comes amidst past challenges for Ronin. In August 2024, the network suffered a major breach when hackers exploited a vulnerability in its bridge validation mechanism, siphoning $9.33 million worth of Ethereum (ETH). Despite this setback, Ronin is doubling down on security and development, aiming to rebuild trust and expand its reach. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market shows mixed signals. With a total capitalization of $3.49 trillion and a trading volume surge of 30.32% to $160.68 billion, altcoins like XRP are thriving, while Ethereum struggles at $3,315. However, analysts remain optimistic, predicting a potential rally to $4,500 as investor interest in ETH grows. RTX Coin: A Top Altcoin with Massive Growth Potential The RTX token, priced at $0.0207 during its presale, presents a compelling investment opportunity. With forecasts predicting a 10x growth during the presale and a potential 5,000% increase post-launch, it’s gaining traction as a top altcoin, driven by the rising demand for innovative cross border payment solutions.

Analysts reported the TRUMP coin price achieved $7.5B market capitalization in the early hours; a surge to $8M would make it the third biggest meme-themed cryptocurrency, surpassing Pepe Coin. TRUMP Challenge Pepe Coin For Third Spot Pepe Coin, a famous frog-themed meme coin, was launched in 2023 and has dominated the crypto market ever since. Similar to the massive rally of the TRUMP memecoin, the PEPE entered the market with a considerable uptrend. At that time, the PEPE price surged from $0.00000000001898 to $0.000000378 within a few days, building a lifetime image and demand in investors’ eyes. The surges and profitable behaviors do not end there, as in 2024, the token created multiple all-time highs, making it among the most bullish meme coins . It hit its prime in December 2024, reaching a peak of $0.00002825, but has consolidated 33% since then, currently trading at $0.00001888 with $7.94B in market capitalization and $1.62B in trading volume. Like these surges, the token faces a massive downtrend as traders sold their holdings for profits. The same is feared for the TRUMP crypto coin. It is because there are doubts about its credibility and whether Donald TRUMP launched this memecoin or not. Regardless of the situation, many traders made millions from a few bucks, making shocking returns with this token. With such a performance, it is challenging PEPE for the third spot. Can TRUMP Memecoin Overtake Pepe Coin Next? Considering Trump’s hype in the market and its connection with President-elect Trump, the token will likely continue its uptrend. This Donald Trump crypto coin may also witness significant consolidation over the doubts of its backing, viability, and legitimacy. Still, with a 3000% surge in 20 hours, it is setting a firm foot in the market. If the hype and demand for the token continue, TRUMP memecoin can overtake Pepe Coin, becoming the third biggest cryptocurrency. However, the PEPE is also advancing in the market with Binance support, giving this newly launched crypto a tough battle. Overall, continuity of momentum, community trust, and market condition are a must for TRUMP crypto price to hit $40 and overtake PEPE with a $8B market cap.

Trump’s Cryptocurrency Project WLFI Allegedly Considering Buying This Surprise Altcoin,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/watch-out-trumps-cryptocurrency-project-wlfi-allegedly-considering-buying-this-surprise-altcoin/,"World Liberty Financial (WLFI), the cryptocurrency project backed by the family of US President-elect Donald Trump, is reportedly planning to add Tron (TRX) tokens to its treasury, according to a source familiar with the matter. The move would further solidify the project’s growing ties to the Tron ecosystem. Tron founder Justin Sun already plays a prominent role as an advisor to World Liberty Financial. Sun is also the largest individual holder of WLFI tokens, having purchased $30 million worth of WLFI tokens in November. While the exact amount of TRX that will be purchased by World Liberty Financial remains unclear, the project has a history of strategically allocating its funds. Having raised $90 million from the WLFI token sale, World Liberty has previously aligned itself with partnerships in the crypto space by investing seven-figure sums in AAVE and LINK tokens. Related News: Onchain Data Shows: Whales Focus on This Altcoin After Binance's Announcement Donald Trump, who serves as WLFI’s “crypto advocate in chief,” has positioned the project as a gateway to bringing crypto-financial services to a broader audience. Trump’s impending return to the White House is seen by many as a potential turning point for the crypto industry. Tron appears to be deeply involved in the project’s expansion.

Despite its viral fame and endorsements from influential figures like Elon Musk, DOGE has yet to deliver on the lofty expectations of its supporters. Meanwhile, the crypto market is increasingly turning its attention to utility-driven projects with real-world applications, and one such rising star is DTX Exchange (DTX). As DOGE holders wait for a breakthrough, DTX is blazing a trail with groundbreaking technology, real-world asset tokenization, and ambitious growth potential. Investors are now faced with a choice: cling to the speculative hope of DOGE or seize the tangible opportunities offered by DTX. Dogecoin Stalls at $0.33: Can Musk Mania Revive Momentum? Dogecoin has been a market staple, thanks to its meme appeal and Elon Musk’s repeated endorsements. Currently trading at $0.33, DOGE has stabilized after a 20% decline earlier in January, finding support at $0.32 despite a broader market sell-off. Source: Tradingview Musk’s rumored plan to acquire Liverpool FC has reignited interest in DOGE, with traders anticipating a potential price resurgence driven by renewed retail enthusiasm. The Open Interest for Dogecoin futures remains strong at $3.4 billion, signaling that many traders are holding their positions in anticipation of a bullish rebound. Technically, DOGE shows signs of resilience, with support at $0.30 and a crucial resistance level at $0.35. Analysts predict that a short squeeze could push DOGE toward its next major resistance at $0.40, but breaking above the $1 milestone remains a long-term challenge, given its inflationary supply and reliance on speculative momentum. DTX Exchange: Redefining Trading With 14,800% Growth Potential While Dogecoin’s growth remains reliant on Musk-driven hype and meme appeal, DTX Exchange is carving out its own path by prioritizing utility and scalability. Powered by the layer-1 VulcanX blockchain, DTX Exchange recently achieved an impressive 200,000 TPS during its testnet upgrade, surpassing established blockchains like Solana and Ethereum in speed and performance. What sets DTX apart is its unified trading platform, which aims to enable users to trade stocks, forex, bonds, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies all in one place, eliminating the need to juggle multiple platforms. Beyond traditional assets, the exchange also supports Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization, enabling users to trade tokenized versions of real estate, commodities, and more. In addition, DTX offers the Phoenix Wallet, a user-friendly and secure decentralized wallet for multi-asset trading, which has already surpassed 50,000 downloads. With the DTX Token in presale at a price of $0.14, raising over $11.5 million, the project is quickly gaining traction as a high-growth investment. Analysts are forecasting a potential 14,800% return as adoption scales. Dogecoin vs. DTX Exchange The key difference between Dogecoin and DTX lies in their growth drivers. DOGE relies heavily on speculative interest and community sentiment, with limited scalability and utility to support its long-term growth. In contrast, DTX focuses on solving real-world problems, offering a comprehensive trading ecosystem that appeals to retail and institutional investors alike. With its technological edge and utility-driven model, DTX presents a clear alternative to the speculative waiting game that DOGE represents. Market Outlook: Speculation vs. Utility in 2025 The crypto market is at a crossroads, with speculative tokens like Dogecoin continuing to capture attention while utility-driven projects such as DTX Exchange gain traction. As DOGE steadies around $0.33, driven by Elon Musk’s influence and strong community support, its long-awaited rise to $1 remains uncertain. On the other hand, DTX’s transformative approach, combining 200,000 TPS scalability with real-world applications like RWA tokenization, sets it apart as a high-growth contender. For investors, the market signals a shift toward utility-focused platforms, making DTX an exciting opportunity in 2025’s evolving landscape.

Dogecoin: From Meme to Market Marvel – Is the Doge Still Woofing? In 2013, Dogecoin (DOGE) entered the crypto world as a lighthearted alternative to serious cryptocurrencies. Featuring a cute Shiba Inu dog as its logo, it embraced fun over formality. Unlike Bitcoin’s limited supply, Dogecoin was made to be abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum limit. What began as a joke by creators Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer quickly caught fire. In 2021, Dogecoin’s value soared, landing it among the top ten cryptocurrencies with a market cap over $50 billion. This surge was driven by social media buzz, especially from Elon Musk, showing how online communities can shape financial markets. Dogecoin’s strength lies in its simplicity and the passionate community behind it. Transactions are fast and fees are low, making it accessible to many. In today’s market, where innovation is key, Dogecoin stands out for its widespread recognition rather than cutting-edge technology. Other coins like Ethereum offer advanced features like smart contracts, attracting attention from developers and investors. Yet, Dogecoin’s charm and the loyalty of its fans keep it in the spotlight. While it doesn’t have the scarcity of Bitcoin, its cultural impact is significant. For those considering it, the Doge still has a playful bark in the bustling crypto kennel. Shiba Inu (SHIB): The Meme Token with Big Ambitions Shiba Inu, or SHIB, began as a playful nod to Dogecoin but has quickly made a name for itself. Launched in August 2020 by the anonymous Ryoshi, SHIB operates on the Ethereum blockchain, joining one of the largest crypto ecosystems. From an initial supply of one quadrillion tokens, half were sent to Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. His donation to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the “burning” of 40% of SHIB’s supply boosted the token’s global profile. What sets SHIB apart is its Ethereum integration, allowing for more than meme status. The creation of ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, shows SHIB’s move towards real utility. Plans for an NFT platform and a DAO-based governance system point to a roadmap for growth. In today’s market, where utility and community matter, SHIB’s place in Ethereum’s ecosystem could make it appealing to those interested in emerging crypto projects. Compared to other memecoins, SHIB’s technological goals and active development might give it an edge in the evolving crypto space. Conclusion While DOGE and SHIB paved the way, XYZVerse stands out by uniting sports and meme culture, aiming for 20,000% growth and becoming the G.O.A.T of all memecoins.

He also issued a statement on X, formerly Twitter. Phantom, the non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet backed by Sequoia and Andreessen Horowitz, verified that it’s real. Still, Findeisen wishes it weren’t true. “I hope to everything that I will wake up and find I’ve been deep faked,” he said. My NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025 The YouTube sleuth, known for his scathing exposé videos aimed at alleged crypto scams (i.e. Hawk Tuah Girl and Andrew Tate ), fears that the latest crypto project from Trump is aimed solely at enriching insiders while exploiting the President-elect’s MAGA supporters just less than two days before the inauguration. Below are the key takeaways from Findeisen’s breakdown: Launch of Trump Meme Coin : Trump — who already launched the World Liberty Financial (WLFI) toekn with his sons last year — unveiled a new meme coin, dubbed “Trump Coin.” Findeisen criticizes the timing, suggesting it was a cynical attempt to profit off the political hype ahead of the swearing-in ceremony on Jan. 20. Market Cap & Fees : The meme coin currently boasts a market cap of $13 billion. Despite this, Findeisen points out that its intrinsic value is zero. Additionally, over $12 million has been made in fees just from trading volume, highlighting the coin’s speculative nature. Source: CoinGecko Lack of Transparency : 80% of the coin is owned by Trump’s camp, Findeisen points out. Only 20% of ‘Official Trump’ is available to the public. Of that 20%, 10% went to the liquidity pool, and another 10% went to public allocation. The allocation breakdown for the remaining 80% is notably vague, with obscure labels like “CIC Digital 1, 2, 3, etc.” Lock-up Periods : The 80% owned by insiders will gradually be unlocked over a three-year period, with different groups experiencing varying lock-up durations of three to 12 months. This unlock will coincide with Trump’s presidency, which he believes adds a layer of exploitation. Losses Likely : The real money will be made by insiders who knew about the launch in advance and got in at the ground level, Findeisen explains. The remaining public will likely lose money. You might also like: MrBeast, Andrew Tate and 8 other celebrities with messy crypto promotions Criticism of insider profits Findeisen calls out the hypocrisy of using the presidency to promote a meme coin, stating that it’s an unprecedented conflict of interest. “To say it’s a conflict of interest is like insulting all the people who’ve had conflicts of interest before,” Findeisen says. “It’s so crazy to use the presidency in this manner to pump a meme coin to enrich yourself, insiders, and basically everyone but your standard base.” Findeisen also speculates that the Trump camp might backtrack or downplay their involvement once the backlash grows. Watch the full video below. Even before the launch of Trump’s meme coin, the Trump family’s involvement in the crypto world has already raised ethical questions, according to the New York Times . The family helped launch WLFI, a crypto platform for borrowing and lending, last fall . Though they aren’t owners or officers, the Trump family has a deal to be paid for promoting it. The company gained traction after crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun joined the venture as an advisor and purchased $30 million in tokens. The company claims to have 20,000 token holders, but the tokens are not resellable, meaning they hold no immediate value. Despite this, purchases made by unpublicized investors should generate millions of dollars in payments to the Trump family. Trump, Bitcoin and Ethereum Trump has already shown his influence in the crypto market, notably claiming credit when Bitcoin ( BTC ) surpassed $100,000 after he nominated Paul Atkins as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Trump also owns up to $5 million in Ethereum ( ETH ), which has also surged in value since the election, the New York Times reported. Under Atkins, the SEC will likely to introduce rules that could boost the value of cryptocurrencies in general, specifically tokens related to World Liberty Financial and Trump’s official meme coin. These changes could potentially lead to hundreds of millions in additional payouts for Trump and his family.

Dogecoin has a strong potential for growth due to its high adoption and strong community. However, DOGE is considered a highly volatile coin, and its unlimited supply raises questions about its future price. Social media news and trends also highly affect the meme coin, so diversification is advised. However, the coin is expected to touch the $0.899 level by 2026. Why is DOGE down? DOGE’s price increased to $0.397 over the last 24 hours. Side by side, the presence of strong resistance at the $0.416 mark is yet to be overcome by DOGE. Will DOGE reach $0.450? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It’s expected that the coin will touch this level by August 2025. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin’s current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support for this meme coin can push it to $1. Will DOGE reach $5? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE could not reach the $5 level in the foreseeable future. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it’s trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is following a downward pattern since it peaked at $0.468 on December 8, 2024, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $2.51 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

As Trump gears up for leadership, these cryptocurrencies demonstrate robust fundamentals and significant market promise. Here’s an insightful look at what distinguishes them and why they could be valuable additions to your portfolio before the next big wave. 1.

Cardano (ADA): Enhancing Blockchain Governance & Functionality Cardano is actively improving its blockchain framework, most notably through the Plomin hard fork focused on governance enhancements. Despite ADA’s recent drop to $0.97, significant investor interest is evident, with a substantial accumulation of over 10 million ADA in a single day. Cardano’s emphasis on scalability and smart contract functionality sets it up for enduring success. 6.

Amid these developments, BlockDAG emerges as a key player to watch. Preparing for a significant leap, BlockDAG is set to list on 10 major centralized exchanges (CEXs), a move anticipated to significantly boost its market presence and appeal. Presently, in the latter stages of its presale, BlockDAG (BDAG) introduces a compelling edge with an exclusive affiliate program. This initiative offers participants a 10% cashback in USDT (BEP-20) for each referral and purchase, a strategic advantage as financial analysts suggest BDAG could hit the $1 mark by 2025, making it a timely opportunity for buyers to secure assets before an expected rise in value. BlockDAG’s Affiliate Program: Leverage BDAG for Potential Rewards As BlockDAG’s presale draws to a close, having already accumulated over $181.5 million and distributed more than 17.9 billion BDAG coins, the surge in its current price to $0.0234 from just $0.001 at launch speaks volumes about its market demand. With listings on 10 major CEXs imminent, BlockDAG is gearing up to compete at the upper echelons of the crypto world. Enhancing its appeal, BlockDAG’s limited-time affiliate program offers a 10% cashback in USDT (BEP-20) on referrals and purchases. Consider a scenario where a participant purchases $5000 worth of BDAG through a referral link; both the referrer and the purchaser instantly benefit from $500 in USDT cashback, optimizing the stake’s value significantly. This option to repeatedly use referral links over the program’s 10-day duration opens up extensive benefits for all involved. This cashback initiative aligns perfectly with the presale’s concluding phase, allowing buyers to stock up on BDAG before its value potentially escalates following its upcoming listings. With predictions of BDAG reaching $1 by 2025, these early holdings might result in substantial financial gains. BlockDAG’s focus on scalability, advanced technology, and user-centric incentives solidifies its standing as a top contender in the layer 1 crypto space, offering a unique opportunity for significant growth. Toncoin Ecosystem: Evolution & Key Achievements Toncoin’s ecosystem has experienced notable growth, particularly with the milestone of issuing over $1 billion in USDT on the TON blockchain, ranking it as the fifth-largest network for Tether transactions. This achievement highlights TON’s expanding role in the stablecoin and decentralized finance (DeFi) sectors. Moreover, as TON’s decentralized applications gain momentum, the platform is proving integral for developers seeking scalable solutions. With its current market price at $5.34 and a valuation surpassing $13.5 billion, TON’s trajectory suggests it is positioning itself as a formidable project within the Layer 1 category. Solana Price Forecast 2025: Key Drivers of Interest The anticipation surrounding Solana’s price for 2025 is fueled by its demonstrated ecosystem growth, notably its dominance in AI-driven decentralized app activity, accounting for 70% of such transactions. This showcases its scalability and efficiency, attributes highly valued by developers. With Solana currently trading around $203 and facing a critical resistance level at $240, surpassing this threshold could set the stage for reaching heights well beyond $1,000 by the end of 2025. Solana’s ongoing expansion in DeFi and NFT sectors continues to attract significant attention, underscoring its potential as a leading player among Layer 1 blockchains. Final Thoughts With Toncoin’s ecosystem flourishing through significant milestones and Solana’s projected growth drawing attention, BlockDAG sets itself apart with upcoming major exchange listings and a limited-time 10% USDT cashback offer. With expert forecasts suggesting BDAG could reach $1 by 2025, this presents a strategic opportunity to establish a position in a promising top layer 1 crypto.

Dogwifhat (WIF): A Rising Meme Coin on the Solana Blockchain Dogwifhat (WIF) is a meme coin gaining attention on the Solana blockchain. It draws inspiration from the viral Dogwifhat meme. Meme coins like WIF are part of a trend that uses internet culture to build community-based cryptocurrencies. These coins often emphasize community and entertainment. Dog-themed coins are particularly popular in the crypto world. WIF and similar coins stand out because of their fun aspect, although they are known for large supplies and volatile prices. The coin’s appeal lies in engaging community participation. Its success depends on meme-driven popularity. In the current market, meme coins attract those interested in trends rather than traditional investment stability.

As Solana (SOL) ascends past $200, indicating a bullish trend, and Dogecoin (DOGE) maintains stability at $0.07, BlockDAG introduces a unique affiliate program to involve its community actively. With a 10% cashback in USDT for referrals and purchases, alongside significant presale growth surpassing $181.5 million, BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing attention with real benefits for its users. BlockDAG Enhances Community Involvement with New Affiliate Rewards BlockDAG recently unveiled a fresh affiliate program aimed at boosting community engagement and expanding its user base. For the upcoming 10 days, members can gain 10% cashback in USDT on each referral and purchase, presenting a direct advantage for participants in the ecosystem. This dual-reward mechanism promotes shared success and teamwork among users. This initiative arrives as BlockDAG approaches the $200 million milestone in its presale. With over 170,000 unique holders and BDAG coin prices rising from $0.001 to $0.0248, the presale reflects a substantial growth of 2,380%. These achievements emphasize the project’s progress and increasing attractiveness. The financial advantages of this program are considerable. Using BlockDAG’s ROI Calculator, participants can estimate their potential earnings. For example, a user referring five friends, each purchasing $2,000 in BDAG coins, would earn $1,000 in USDT, with each friend also gaining $200 in USDT instantly. If a more ambitious user refers ten friends, each purchasing $5,000, they could secure a significant $5,000 in USDT. By offering instant rewards and a clear earning model, BlockDAG strengthens its commitment to its community while promoting its presale activities. Those seeking growth-focused opportunities should consider participating soon to optimize their benefits. Solana’s Surge Above $200: Will the Rise Continue? Solana (SOL) recently broke the $200 mark, suggesting a potential uptrend. After securing support above $175, SOL’s price climbed, surpassing resistance at $180 and $185, and hitting a high of $206 before stabilizing. Current resistance stands at $205, with further challenges expected at $212 and $220. If it crosses $220, the value might climb towards $232 and possibly $245. If it fails to stay above $205, a decrease might occur. Important support levels are found at $196 and $190, with a drop below $190 potentially lowering the price to around $185 or even $172. Technical analysis shows varying signals. The hourly MACD indicates decreasing upward momentum, but the RSI remains over 50, showing ongoing interest from buyers. Dogecoin’s Market Position: Stability and Breakout Possibilities Dogecoin (DOGE) maintains its position, trading at $0.07 with a trading volume of $200 million, reflecting a slight increase of 2%. Critical support is noted at $0.065 and $0.060, with resistance at $0.075 and $0.080. Breaking past $0.075 might spark a rise, aiming for $0.080. However, falling below $0.065 could lead to declines towards $0.060. Market sentiment is tentatively positive as traders look for more definitive trends. The broader market dynamics and the sentiment around meme coins will likely influence DOGE’s short-term path. Given DOGE’s tendency for rapid price changes influenced by online trends and market conditions, these levels are crucial for traders. Participants are advised to keep a close watch and practice careful risk management in this unpredictable market. The Bottom Line Solana’s ascent above $200 points to potential continued upward momentum, while Dogecoin’s steadiness suggests traders are cautiously optimistic. However, BlockDAG distinguishes itself with a focus on community engagement, highlighted by its attractive 10% cashback affiliate program and a crypto presale that is close to reaching $200 million. For those looking for immediate benefits and prospective growth, BlockDAG’s approach combines community involvement with tangible progress, making it a noteworthy contender in a market where timing and tangible value are key.

However, another actor will shortly replace Ripple and leave it behind as the cryptocurrency market grows. With its innovative technology, practical uses, and opportunity for exceptional profits, Rexas Finance (RXS) is quickly becoming the hidden weapon of every astute investor. Rexas Finance (RXS): Tokenizing Real-World Assets By utilizing its creative environment, Rexas Finance (RXS) distinguishes itself from many other rivals, including Ripple. Emphasizing tokenizing actual assets, the platform provides a flawless means for investors to purchase, sell, and trade blockchain-based properties. By accomplishing this, Rexas Finance (RXS) changes conventional real estate markets and brings blockchain openness, efficiency, and accessibility. This tokenization technique removes many obstacles related to property transactions, such as exorbitant expenses and protracted delays. Instead, investors can access a worldwide market with reduced transaction costs and enhanced security for less expense. Rexas Finance (RXS) is positioned as a game-changer in both the blockchain and conventional finance sectors because it has the potential to transform real estate markets. Starting stage 11 of its presale, Rexas Finance (RXS) sells tokens for $0.175. This presale has already succeeded, raising over $37.2 million and selling over 403.6 million tokens. Since its first stage, when tokens were sold for just $0.03, the presale price has skyrocketed by an incredible 483%. These benchmarks highlight rising investor faith in RXS's power to upend established markets and even its crypto rivals. The tremendous presale performance of Rexas Finance (RXS) shows unequivocally its growing appeal. The creative approach of the initiative and openness appeal to investors more and more. Increasing over $37.2 million shows the financial support and the faith of a developing community of followers. Moreover, Rexas Finance (RXS) has maintained its credibility through calculated actions. Investors can easily monitor the token's development since it is published on credible sites like Coin Market Cap and CoinGecko. Certik, one of the most reputable blockchain security companies, has thoroughly audited Rexas Finance. This audit supports the project's dedication to openness and security, which are essential for winning and preserving investor confidence. How to Join the RXS Presale The continuous presale offers a great chance to get Rexas Finance tokens before prices soar. Investors may join by visiting the official Rexas Finance (RXS) website to guarantee a safe purchase and prevent fraud. Connect a compatible cryptocurrency wallet to the Rexas platform, use Ethereum (ETH) or USDT to buy RXS tokens safely, and then safely keep the tokens in the wallet. Tracking the presale's development helps investors keep current with pricing adjustments and innovations. This straightforward and safe approach guarantees that early adoption will be freely accessible to even individuals unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies, benefiting them. While Rexas Finance (RXS) targets a new and quite profitable market—real estate—Ripple concentrates on enabling cross-border payments and transactions for financial institutions. While Rexas Finance's approach appeals to institutional and daily investors, Ripple's reliance on relationships with banks has hindered its acceptance by ordinary consumers. Rexas Finance (RXS) provides easier access through its presale system since early adopters may lock in tokens at reduced rates. This runs counter to Ripple, which has already become rather successful and has little space for the rapid expansion potential RXS presents. Conclusion Ripple is having difficulty keeping up with the competition in a robust market. Rexas Finance (RXS) is quickly becoming a strong competitor with a better value offer. Its successful pre-sale, new ecosystem, and useful real-world uses make it a strong candidate to lead the next stage of blockchain usage. People looking for the next big business chance will love Rexas Finance (RXS) because it has openness, new ideas, and room to grow. Rexas Finance (RXS) is breaking down barriers in the real estate market and turning real-world assets into tokens. What this means for cryptocurrency is a big step forward. Do not wait past the due date. Act now to get in on the Rexas Finance (RXS) pre-sale. This hidden tool could revolutionize the cryptocurrency industry and surpass Ripple. Your investment will skyrocket.

By 2028, BSV may potentially achieve a peak price of $265.28 with an average price of $248.70. In 2031, the target price for BSV is between $397.93 and $431.09, with an average price of $414.51. Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision (BSV), a cryptocurrency that emerged from a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash in November 2018, which itself was a fork of the original Bitcoin network, represents a unique facet of the evolving landscape of digital currencies. BSV’s approach to scalability, a critical aspect of blockchain technology, is primarily focused on increasing block size. This method, similar to that of Bitcoin Cash, allows for more transactions per block, theoretically enhancing transaction throughput. The recent rallying of Bitcoin forks, including BCH, BSV, and XEC, raised questions about the sustainability and organic nature of these gains. Nevertheless, BSV continues to find support within a segment of the cryptocurrency community, particularly among those who value its adherence to Nakamoto’s original vision and its focus on scalability. Is BSV the token of the future? Would it be profitable to buy Bitcoin SV? Let’s get into the details. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Satoshi’s Vision Token BSV Price $55.57 Market Cap $1,093,033,976 Trading Volume $75,909,978 Circulating Supply 19,812,878 BSV All-time High $489.75 Apr 16, 2021 All-time Low $21.43 Jun 10, 2023 24-hour High $59.89 24-hour Low $54.88 BSV price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 3.90% 50-Day SMA 61.60 100-Day SMA 51.48 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed 77 (Extreme Greed) Green Days 15/30 (50%) BSV price analysis: BSV slips to $55.57 amidst upside TL;DR Breakdown Bitcoin SV price analysis confirmed a bearish trend at $55.57.

The red candlestick on the one-day price chart marks an intensifying downward spell. Technical indicators and price charts support the sellers for the day. Is BSV a good investment? Investing in BSV necessitates an evaluation of the Bitcoin SV market and its emphasis on scalability, which seeks to optimize transaction processing and minimize associated fees. Despite the potential utility and adoption benefits that BSV presents, investors are advised to exercise caution on account of regulatory uncertainties and market volatility. Earnings from BSV require long-term investment decisions, whether holding or trading, but in this dynamic market, risk management is primarily achieved through diversification and keeping abreast of developments. However, it is expected that BSV/USD will reach $431.09 by 2031. Why is BSV down? The BSV/USD crypto pair price has dipped today as the selling influx has abruptly taken over the market, dropping the price to the $55 range. The bears are targeting the support of 54.7 next, but overall, the coin’s value has decreased significantly over the past week, especially since the December 4 depreciation has impacted the coin’s value negatively. Will BSV recover? Bitcoin SV is dipping over the short term; nevertheless, the decrease in price levels is gradual, with bullish periods in between. The price action is nothing unusual in the crypto market, and there are equal chances of a price reversal in the upward direction. Will BSV reach $100? BSV will have to surpass quite a few crucial resistance levels to reach $100. With a prolonged bearish trend and BSV’s current price action, it is not easy but still possible for BSV to reclaim the $100 mark by the start of 2026. Will BSV reach $200? Per Cryptopolitan price prediction, BSV has chances of reaching $200 in the next three years. It is expected that the Bitcoin SV will reach $200 by the end of 2027. Will BSV reach $500? To reach $500, BSV’s value will have to increase ninefold. Though not impossible, market analysts expect a lower chance of reaching this level within the next five years. Does BSV have a good long-term future? BSV is expected to increase in value gradually over the coming years. Currently, the coin is trading at the lowest level of the last nine months; however, it is expected to reach $431.09 by 2031, which makes it a valuable asset for multiple gains.

It initially traded below $100 before reaching an all-time high of around $255 in June 2019. However, BSV experienced a significant decline to around $80 by December 2019. In 2020, it recovered to reach levels above $300 in February but faced a drop due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout 2021, BSV fluctuated between $150 and $300 for the most part but also reached an all-time high (ATH) of $491.64 on April 16. BSV has been on a downward trend since the start of 2022, going from $125.49 to $39.80 in December 2022. In 2023, Bitcoin SV (BSV) primarily traded between $40 and $50. However, it experienced a significant rise, reaching $94 on December 31. Bitcoin SV’s price started 2024 at $95, surged to $115 on March 4, and plunged to $71 on March 21. On April 1, 2024, BSV was priced at $95 again, but it came down to $60 by the end of the month. For most of May, BSV traded above $60. BSV started a new wave of decline at the start of June and came down to the $40 range by mid-year. However, the token started a gradual recovery by August 2024, which continued till November, after which BSV started making waves again. In December 2024, BSV peaked at $83.44, but it dropped to $50.26 at the end of the year.

Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has announced “major changes” to the leadership structure of the Ethereum Foundation (EF) following increasing criticism from the community. In a detailed statement, Buterin outlined ongoing reforms aimed at improving the foundation’s effectiveness and alignment with the ecosystem it serves: “We are currently in the process of major changes to the EF leadership structure that have been ongoing for close to a year. Some of these have already been implemented and made public, while others are still ongoing.” According to Buterin, leadership changes are aimed at achieving several key goals: Increasing technical expertise under the leadership of the Ethereum Foundation. Strengthening communication and collaboration between EF leadership and ecosystem stakeholders, including users, developers, wallets, and Layer 2 (L2) projects. Hiring new talent to increase execution speed and organizational agility. Providing more active support to application developers while preserving core Ethereum values such as privacy, open source, and censorship resistance. Leveraging the Ethereum blockchain for treasury management and payments, as well as increasing the use of decentralized and privacy-preserving technologies. Buterin also addressed concerns about potential shifts in the foundation’s mission by emphasizing what the changes were not intended to accomplish. He rejected the idea of veering toward ideological extremes or becoming a centralized entity, saying: “We will not make an ideological turn or adopt extreme mentalities.” “We will not engage aggressively in lobbying regulators or political figures, especially in powerful countries.” “The EF will not become an arena for vested interests or a highly centralised organisation.” Buterin reiterated that the Ethereum Foundation's role is to remain a neutral and decentralized platform and ensure that it continues to serve the global ecosystem. *This is not investment advice.

Solana ( SOL ) rose to a high of $245 on Saturday, up by 42% from its lowest point this month, bringing its valuation to $117 billion. It has become the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Tether. Source: CoinGecko Here are some top reasons why SOL spiked and why that rally will likely continue. Solana’s ecosystem growth Solana has jumped because of the ongoing ecosystem growth. Its meme coins have grown and accumulated over $22 billion in market cap. Official Trump ( TRUMP ), which President-elect Donald Trump unveiled on Jan. 17, has a valuation of $4.4 billion. The other popular meme coins in the ecosystem are Bonk ( BONK ), Dogwifhat ( WIF ), and Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ). Solana is also a big player in the non-fungible token industry. According to CryptoSlam , Solana’s NFTs had over $81 million in sales in the last 30 days, making it the third-biggest player after Ethereum and Bitcoin. Solana’s ecosystem may continue growing because of its faster transaction speeds, lower costs, and the popularity of its Decentralized Exchange networks. Data shows that Solana’s DEX networks handled $32.2 billion in the last seven days, higher than Ethereum’s $9.2 billion. This growth has led to higher network fees, which totaled $820 million in the last 365 days and $77 million this year. Some of these funds flow to Solana stakers; they’re receiving a 7% yield. Solana revenue and fees | Source: TokenTerminal SOL ETF hopes are steady Solana price has also rallied as investors anticipate the potential ETF approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission. A Polymarket poll places those odds at 77%, meaning that the agency under Paul Atkins may be more open to approval. A Solana ETF would likely lead to more demand for the coin from institutional investors. This demand would be higher if the agency was open to allowing these tokens to be staked. In a note this week, JPMorgan anticipated that a Solana ETF would attract between $3 billion and $6 billion in the first year. You might also like: Solana ETF approval by July 2025? Polymarket odds spike Solana price technicals are supportive SOL price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the SOL token rebounded after forming a double-bottom pattern at $175.42. It has now moved above the pattern’s neckline at $222.95, its highest swing on Jan. 6. Solana, founded in 2020 by engineer Anatoly Yakovenko, remains above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swings since January 23 last year. It has remained above the 50-day moving average, while the Relative Strength Index has tilted upwards. Therefore, the Solana price will likely continue rising, a move that will be confirmed if the token rises above the key resistance at $264.15, its highest point in 2024. Solana up until now Yakovenko envisioned a blockchain capable of scaling to millions of transactions per second, providing a solution to what critics said were Ethereum’s slow transaction speeds and high fees. The network is designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and cryptocurrency transactions. Solana touts faster transaction processing and a higher throughput than many of its competitors. After its mainnet launch in 2020, Solana quickly gained attention for its speed and low-cost transactions, attracting developers and investors. Throughout 2021, the network grew with numerous decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and non-fungible tokens on its platform. Solana, currently backed by big-name venture firms like Andreessen Horowitz, continues to enjoy rapid development via efficient blockchain solutions in the ever-growing crypto space.

Trump first announced the launch of the memecoin in his statement on his social media platform Truth Social and shared the contract address. The new memecoin operates on the Solana network. At first, it was suspected that Donald Trump’s account might have been hacked and the shared altcoin might be a scam. However, recent information suggests that this memecoin was actually created by Trump. 80% of the memecoin’s total supply is locked in the founder’s multisig wallet. Having passed the $1 billion market cap mark just minutes after its launch, memecoin has a market cap of over $4 billion at the time of writing. Related News: BREAKING: Binance Listed the Most Talked Memecoin of the Last Hours on Futures With a fully diluted market value of around $22 billion, the altcoin has already surpassed Trump’s personal fortune of $6.8 billion.

Elon Bromance (ELOBRO), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because ELOBRO is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Elon Bromance can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Elon Bromance could become the next viral memecoin. Elon Bromance launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Elon Bromance on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Elon Bromance by entering its contract address – FY7aYv7K3yEE9Z8hzgURj5z7biTE8Z6BpunBPAnCEpxj – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like ELOBRO. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-18 15:27:00

The uptick made USDC the fastest-growing fiat-pegged crypto asset by market capitalization in the last 12 months. Regulatory Compliance According to the report , the supply of USDC went from a low of $24.4 billion in early 2024 to $43.9 billion by January 1, 2025. This growth is in stark contrast to 2023, when the stablecoin shrank by 45% to $33.2 billion following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). The Santa Clara-based financial institution had held about $3.3 billion of Circle’s cash reserves. Its failure triggered a massive sell-off that caused USDC to briefly depeg from the U.S. dollar. Fast-forward to the present, the virtual asset now operates across 16 blockchains and has facilitated fiat currency transfers worth more than $850 billion. Moreover, in November 2024, its monthly transaction volume broke past the $1 trillion mark, pushing its historical transaction total to more than $18 trillion. Circle Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte credited USDC’s recent progress to his company’s proactive engagement with regulators. This was exemplified by its becoming the first stablecoin issuer to secure a license under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework. Headquartered in Boston, Circle was also one of the few crypto firms that met Canada’s stringent VRCA listing standards. Those requirements led several companies, including Kraken , Bitstamp, and Bybit , to halt operations in the country. Tether Still Dominant However, it has not all been smooth sailing for the organization. Toward the end of last year, Circle was reportedly forced to slash its workforce by more than 6% following what it called a routine operational assessment. Also, despite the growth recorded in the past year, USDC still trails USDT. The number one stablecoin ended 2024 with its market cap at an eye-watering $137.5 billion. This amount represents 66% of the entire stablecoin sector, which is worth nearly $208 billion. Furthermore, since 2021, USDT’s value has increased by more than 74%, while USDC’s has improved by a less remarkable 8.8%. Data from CoinGecko shows that Tether was capped at $78.3 billion in 2021, while the now-rebranded USD Coin stood at $42 billion. Tether also recently announced that it is moving its operations to El Salvador and building its first physical headquarters after being licensed as a digital service provider in the country. The company, which expanded its BTC reserves by $700 million on the last day of 2024, reported net profits of $7.7 billion in the first three quarters of that year.

Bank of America’s unrealized losses on mostly US agency mortgage-backed securities could jump to $111 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of 29% from the previous quarter, reports Barron’s . Bank of America’s held-to-maturity assets stood at $568 billion as of the third quarter of 2024, according to a regulatory filing , including an unrealized loss of $86 billion at the time. The bank’s unrealized losses continue to widen as the yield on 10-year US treasuries nears 5%. And most of Bank of America’s held-to-maturity debt securities are comprised of agency mortgage-backed securities, which are witnessing similarly rising yields. BofA’s unrealized bond losses are the highest in the industry. By comparison, the nation’s largest bank JPMorgan Chase has about $20 billion in unrealized losses as of Q3 2024. In its Quarterly Banking Profile report issued in December, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) said the number of US lenders on its “Problem Bank List” rose to 68 in Q3, with total unrealized losses at all major banks standing at $364 billion.

Historical Data Says ADA Is Ready To Take Off,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-price-to-6-historical-data-says-ada-is-ready-to-take-off/,"With the bearish pressure in the cryptocurrency market dissipating, large-cap altcoins are showing good signs of recovery. Cardano, specifically, has quickly established itself as one of the best-performing assets in the crypto market in 2025. After the downside pressure over the past few weeks, the Cardano price finally reclaimed and held above the $1 mark in the past week. The question now is — what’s the next move for the ADA token? Is A 400% Rally On The Cards For ADA Price? In a recent post on social media platform X, popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared the next step for the Cardano price after the latest downturn. The crypto pundit revealed the price fractals that could see the ADA token move to as high as $6. Related Reading: Crypto Fear And Greed Index Barrels Toward Extreme Greed Again As Bitcoin Price Clears $101,000, Is This Good News? In technical analysis, fractals refer to recurring patterns on a price chart. Typically, the patterns provide insight into historical price movements and can be used to predict the future trajectory of a cryptocurrency. After a 44% correction, #Cardano $ADA began its second leg up during the week of February 1, 2021. Now, #ADA has already undergone a 43% correction, suggesting the next leg up could be just two to three weeks away. $6 next! pic.twitter.com/xyvwZxdOFf — Ali (@ali_charts) January 17, 2025 Martinez revealed that the price of Cardano is currently at a point similar to where it was four years ago. After breaking out of the consolidation range in late 2020, the altcoin surged to around $0.4 before February 2021. However, the ADA price hit a roadblock around $0.4, falling by more than 40% before continuing its upward trend. The price of Cardano eventually soared to above $3 — the current all-time high — in this cycle. Martinez explained that the ADA token, having just experienced an almost identical 40%, might be on the verge of a bullish breakout. The analyst said that the next move up for the altcoin could be “just two to three weeks away.” Using the historical price data, Martinez predicted that the price of Cardano could push to as high as $6, setting a new record high. This would represent an impressive 400% surge from the current price point. Cardano Price At A Glance As of this writing, the Cardano token is valued at $1.15, reflecting an almost 5% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the ADA price is up by more than 20% in the last seven days.

WazirX says the freeze represents an “important milestone” in recovering user assets. “Why This Matters: » Rapid Action: Freezing the funds stops them from being moved and helps with the recovery process. » Focus on Recovery: Every measure is being taken to address the cyberattack’s impact and recover additional funds. » Commitment to Users: Every amount frozen & recovered strengthens our mission to safeguard the assets and rebuild trust.” A hacker plundered more than $230 million worth of assets from the exchange last July and has been laundering some of the stolen crypto through the mixing platform Tornado Cash. In August, WazirX announced it was going to roll back all trades and restore all associated account balances to what they were before the withdrawal stoppage on July 18th, but the exchange also noted it wasn’t possible to resume crypto withdrawals yet. “Due to the cyberattack and loss of a significant balance of ERC-20 tokens as a result of the theft, there are insufficient token assets available to meet the liabilities arising from the token balances owing to users of the platform. The nature of the cyberattack means that there will likely always be a mix of users who support and oppose various outcomes. The key to being able to resume cryptocurrency withdrawals in an equitable way is to do so as part of a legally binding solution agreed to and approved by users in line with legally defined voting thresholds.” Zettai Pte Ltd, the company that operates WazirX, filed an application with the Singapore High Court last month for permission to convene a meeting of its creditors and vote on a recovery plan. Crypto sleuth ZachXBT has reported the hack appears to be traceable to the Lazarus Group, a notorious digital asset hacking organization based in North Korea.

Amid this, Solana-based altcoins are gaining significant attention from crypto enthusiasts due to their impressive price surges, including Solana’s native token, SOL. Source: Coinglass Solana (SOL) Performance and Current Price Momentum With a price surge of over 12% in the past 24 hours, SOL is currently trading near $243 and is once again approaching its all-time high. Notably, SOL has gained over 35% in just four days. Amid this bullish trend, participation from traders and investors has skyrocketed, leading to a 170% increase in trading volume. Reason Behind SOL’s Rally SOL’s impressive momentum can be attributed to a recent breakout and market optimism surrounding the pro-crypto stance of President-elect Donald Trump, whose inauguration is approaching. Solana (SOL) Price Prediction According to expert technical analysis, SOL has broken out from a bullish double-bottom price action pattern formed on the daily time frame and has approached a mild resistance level at $245. Considering the current market sentiment, it seems likely that SOL could soon overcome this hurdle and reach a new all-time high. Source: Trading View Despite the significant upside momentum, SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains below the overbought zone, indicating that the altcoin has sufficient room to continue its upward trajectory. Solana-Based Tokens Performance SOL’s bullish trend appears to be influencing other altcoins built on the Solana blockchain, as they are currently leading the market trend. Tokens such as Official Trump (TRUMP), Jupiter (JUP), Raydium (RAY), and Bonk (BONK) have experienced price surges of over 331%, 22%, 14%, and 8%, respectively. These significant gains come at a time when other major assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and XRP seem to be struggling to gain momentum. Meanwhile, other popular Solana-based tokens, such as Dogewithhat (WIF) and Popcat (POPCAT), appear to be struggling. This highlights that simply being built on the Solana blockchain is not enough to gain attention, a token also needs bullish price action, along with significant trader interest and confidence.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-18 15:36:32

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Dogecoin and Pepe hit ATHs in 2024 but now lose steam as investors shift to PayFi project Remittix for profits. The meme coin sector was at its best in 2024, as several tokens rose to new heights among the top meme coins. Following the rise in Bitcoin, the prices of the Dogecoin and Pepe currency skyrocketed to their ATHs in November, hence fueling the mounting hope in their local communities. Now, though, the tides have shifted as even the top altcoins currencies show losses on their charts. In search of profit, Dogecoin and Pepe investors have switched to the new PayFi project, Remittix (RMX). You might also like: Remittix tipped for greater long-term growth than Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Dogecoin price hits 16% monthly loss After its explosive surge in November, the value of the Dogecoin dropped greatly. The price of Dogecoin jumped to almost $0.48 then consolidated around $0.43. From there, other price swings have seen the token hit minor declines; still, the purchasers kept Dogecoin at roughly $0.38 for some time. DOGE has suffered additional strikes during last week when the whole crypto market started to crash. According to Santiment records, the losses for Dogecoin have come from more traders closing their long positions and an increase in pessimistic short-term traders. Additionally declining is the Open Interest, which lessens Dogecoin’s investor presence. The token is trading at $0.32, at the time of writing, while the Dogecoin price dropped 16% over the past month. Now, Remittix is the main focus of the trader buzz. Pepe Coin price chart forms bearish patterns amid monthly lows Trading at $0.00001595, the Pepe coin price has dropped below its monthly lows, same like other meme coins. The reason is not far-fetched; the stock and crypto indices are declining significantly and there is great worry that the Federal interest rates will stay high. Worse still for PEPE is that the token price has been showing a bearish trend during last week. PEPE’s monthly losses come to almost 30.28%; it has dropped nearly 10% in the past 24 hours. Given the PEPE coin price already below its 50 and 100-day EMAs, analysis indicates a breach below the $0.0000146 level would signal bearish domination. More negative movements might perhaps see PEPE at $0.000010 settled. Remittix set to go viral in 2025 Remittix (RTX) is redefining global payments by integrating blockchain technology with fiat transactions, offering fast and cost-efficient cross-border solutions. With support for over 40 cryptocurrencies, including Cardano, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Ethereum, the platform provides instant conversions into fiat currencies like USD and GBP, enabling seamless deposits into recipients’ bank accounts. As a bridge between crypto and fiat, Remittix is the superior counterpart to traditional payment providers such as Stripe and Wise and crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase Wallet. Supporting 30+ fiat currencies and over 50 crypto pairs, Remittix ensures accessibility and inclusivity for businesses and individuals, simplifying global commerce with its extensive range of options. Furthermore notable is the platform’s open flat-fee approach, which offers savings and transparency over exorbitant costs and inadequate exchange rates of conventional banks. This approach guarantees that the full amount sent reaches the recipient, making Remittix a game-changer in the payments industry, where shady practices are unfortunately all too common. Currently priced at $0.0207 during its presale, the RTX token offers a compelling investment opportunity. Forecasts predict significant growth, with a 25x multiplier expected in the presale phase and over 1,500% gains after launch, as demand for unique cross-border payment solutions continues to rise. Remittix offers investors a chance to interact with a project with high growth potential at an earlier stage as the bitcoin market develops. RTX might not only equal the success of other top altcoins but also alter the benchmarks for blockchain-based financial solutions with increasing acceptance, a solid basis, and evident market demand.

However, a supply spike may make things worse for some specific crypto, generating the need to sell before Monday. Why? Let us discuss that in this blog. 3 Altcoins to Sell As Exchange Supply Spikes The ongoing week will witness billions worth of tokens entering the market with unlocks and transfers. This will create the worst scenario for a holder who is carrying those tokens already, as the supply spike usually generates massive selling pressure, resulting in crypto price crashes. This is due to the availability of millions of tokens in the market and rising liquidation, which drops the demand for tokens and the price itself. Sentiment report claims many teams are unlocking and transferring billions of tokens for three altcoins, SPX, LDO, and WLD, which will cause their price to crash. Selling these tokens can save investors from liquidation. 1. SPX 6900 (SPX) Around $3.6M worth of SPX6900 was unlocked on January 17 before being deposited into Bitvavo. These $3.6m tokens are equivalent to 0.32% of the total SPX supply, decreasing the worth of tokens. After adequately analyzing the price trajectory, investors may sell this token before Monday. 2. Lido DAO (LDO) LDO is a prominent player in the Ethereum staking ecosystem and is often in demand among investors. Around $4.1M worth of these tokens were also unlocked recently, which is 0.23% of the total supply. These tokens are sent to the Coinbase Prime on January 16. 3. Worldcoin (WLD) This week, a $4.3M WLD supply entered the market on January 16, resulting in a 4% price drop in the last 24 hours. A 0.21% of the total supply has been sent to the popular cryptocurrency exchange Binance. With increased liquidity and volatility, the Worldcoin price may decline further. Additional altcoins, such as FDUSD, XCN, STRK, and many others, have unlocked more than $1M tokens this week. Why Investors Are Selling This Crypto? ONDO, the 37th biggest cryptocurrency in the market, will unlock 1.94 billion tokens, equivalent to $2.1M at the current market price. This unlock is set to happen on January 18, in which around 134% of its total supply will enter the market. This long-awaited unlock will occur through Cliff Unlock. More importantly, it will be the biggest unlock since November 2024, so the impact may be higher. The 1.94 billion supply exceeds its daily trading volume, leading to investors selling this altcoin. As a result, ONDO trades at $1.23 and has been facing liquidation for weeks. This selling is eventually to recover any gains before the price drops once the liquidity drops the value. Bottom Line The crypto market’s unpredictability is known to every investor, where sudden changes often affect the asset’s prices. The supply spikes are one such factor that results in high liquidity and price drops. Because of this, three popular altcoins , LDO, SPX, and WLD, are at risk of a downtrend with their significant token unlocks. The investor must analyze their performance before trading with them before Monday.

The service, unavailable to residents of New York, lets U.S. account holders access up to $100,000 in USD Coin (USDC), using Bitcoin stored on Coinbase as collateral. The exchange partnered with decentralized finance protocol Morpho Labs to manage the lending process on Base, Coinbase's Ethereum layer-2 network. Max Branzburg, Coinbase's vice president, emphasized the company’s commitment to “economic freedom,” stating the service empowers customers to do more with their Bitcoin holdings on-chain. A Coinbase representative clarified that the company offers users access to the loan market but does not directly issue the loans. Customers can benefit from competitive interest rates, flexible repayment terms, and no Coinbase fees or credit checks. This marks Coinbase’s second venture into Bitcoin lending. The company previously ran a Borrow program, which allowed cash loans backed by BTC holdings, but it was discontinued in November 2023. Bitcoin-backed loans offer an advantage to holders by providing liquidity without requiring them to sell their Bitcoin, helping them avoid hefty tax bills. Wealthy investors have long used asset-leveraged loans as a way to maintain their financial standing, a strategy sometimes referred to as “borrow, borrow, die.” As Bitcoin's value rises, the demand for these loans has surged, creating significant market growth potential. The market for Bitcoin-backed loans is expected to expand from $8.5 billion in 2024 to $45 billion by 2030, according to HFT Market Intelligence. This growing demand is attracting traditional financial institutions to the crypto lending space. Bitcoin-backed lending platform Ledn noted that major players are moving beyond exchange-traded funds to explore crypto lending opportunities. With Bitcoin adoption increasing, Coinbase’s return to this market underscores the broader trend of integrating digital assets into mainstream financial products. The company’s collaboration with Morpho Labs signals a step toward innovative, decentralized financial solutions that cater to a growing segment of crypto-savvy investors. This move aligns with the rising need for flexible, blockchain-driven financial options.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-18 15:41:55

With the CEO already enlisted to co-run the agency alongside Vivek Ramaswamy, the new role adds to the billionaire’s roles with Tesla and the microblogging platform, X. According to a recent Business Insider survey of Tesla shareholders, most of them do not see the need to be worried. Most Tesla investors believe Musk is a capable multitasker. The issue of the time he spends at Tesla caused a stir when it became a topic of interest at the last annual shareholders meeting. Presently, aside from Tesla and X, Musk is involved with The Boring Company, SpaceX, xAI, and Neuralink. Stakeholders believe Tesla could benefit from Musk’s work at DOGE Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been efficient with starting their work at DOGE: slashing the United States federal budget and eliminating wasteful spending. They also have plans to increase efficiency by merging some agencies, while cutting others off totally. However, the job at hand is no small task and would need their full concentration. Tesla shareholders believe that Musk’s work in the Trump administration will help Tesla. They feel that regulations that the company must navigate will greatly reduce, opening the path to technological advancements. For instance, Long Island-based Tesla shareholder Anthony Gurino believes Musk’s work could help reduce the red tape around autonomous driving. Currently, states have discretionary authority to approve the technology. However, Musk has promised to push for a national approval process for autonomous vehicles. Other investors also echoed the same sentiment, with most of them hoping that the new administration translates into goodwill for the company due to Musk’s affiliation with incoming President Donald Trump. Decline in car sales highlights Tesla’s underwhelming year According to one of Tesla’s shareholders from Denmark, Philip Engberg, there were lots of challenges under the Biden administration. He noted that the company’s technologies faced political hurdles. His comments stemmed from Tesla’s snub at President Joe Biden’s EV Summit in 2021, despite being one of the top EV sellers in the country. Tesla, on the other hand, wrapped up an underwhelming year in 2024 after battling increased competition and stagnating growth in the EV market. These challenges caused the company to witness its first car sales decline, according to its January report. Notably, the decline spread across the EV market. Still, Tesla ended the year outselling Audi globally for the first time. Wall Street is also optimistic about Tesla’s chances under the Trump administration, with its shares up by 70% since the election. Analysts from various firms are confident in its ability to rise even further, with Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas raising its target to $430. Others, like Roth Capital’s managing director and senior analyst Craig Irwin, also changed his Tesla buy status from neutral to buy. Debates about Musk’s multitasking ability During the second shareholder vote, Musk’s pay package was approved, with some shareholders noting that it reaffirmed support for him as their leader. Some of the shareholders were also confident in his ability to multitask. While others were worried that his involvement with the government could eventually impact his job at the company, they are still confident he can get the job done. Meanwhile, not all shareholders are convinced about Musk’s affiliation with Trump leading to a positive spell for the company. According to shareholder John VonBokel, who voted against Musk’s second pay package, he is at a loss on why the share price has risen that much. VonBokel talked about the company’s Full-Self-Driving beta software, which requires drivers to be ready to take over driving at any moment. “Certainly, Trump is not going to go in there and write code to make FSD better,” VonBokel said. One shareholder, Charlie Redmond, also went as far as predicting that Musk’s relationship with Trump will not last more than six months. He highlighted that the only benefit that the company could enjoy is Musk eventually convincing Trump to keep the EV tax break, which Trump has said he will remove. Another shareholder noted that when the relationship eventually falls apart, it could affect the stock, even though it could recover in the long term.

The premier cryptocurrency didn’t stay more than a day above this level the last time it surpassed a six-figure valuation. However, the price of Bitcoin has returned to as high as $105,000 this time around, its highest level so far in 2025. Interestingly, it appears that this might only be the beginning of an even bigger rally for the Bitcoin price over the next 12 months. Is 2025 The Peak Year For Bitcoin Price? In its latest weekly report, blockchain intelligence firm CryptoQuant revealed its target for the Bitcoin price in the year 2025. The on-chain analytics platform sheds light on the potential trajectory of the flagship cryptocurrency over the year. CryptoQuant projected the price of Bitcoin to reach as high as $249,000 — or at least $145,000 — in the new year. This represents somewhere between a 45% to 150% positive yearly performance for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The market intelligence expects the Bitcoin price rally to be catalyzed by institutional capital flows, in the context of a favorable regulatory environment, accommodative monetary policy in the United States , and historical cyclical patterns. For instance, the imminent inauguration and administration of pro-crypto Donald Trump is expected to see crypto-friendly regulators take office and implement positive executive actions. Hence, CryptoQuant anticipates a Bitcoin demand rise when President Trump returns to the Oval Office. Furthermore, optimistic macroeconomic conditions are also expected to play a significant role in the Bitcoin price performance in 2025. “The projected interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve could provide a favorable environment for capital to flow into risk assets like Bitcoin,” the report read. Additionally, 2025 is the last year in Bitcoin’s 4-year cycle, which has been historically correlated with significant price surges. The price of Bitcoin reached a new record high of over $67,000 in the final year of the previous cycle. While this historical perspective suggests that the market leader could reach a new all-time high price this year, it also signals the likelihood of a Bitcoin price top in 2025. As of this writing, the Bitcoin price stands at around 104,450, reflecting an over 4% increase in the past day. How Much Capital Will Flow Into Bitcoin In 2025? According to CryptoQuant , roughly $520 billion could flow into the flagship cryptocurrency this year, especially considering favorable regulatory, monetary, and cyclical conditions. This projection was calculated based on the realized capitalization metric, which is the sum value (in US dollars) of each Bitcoin when it last moved on-chain. CryptoQuant noted: A total of $86 billion flowed into Bitcoin from 2015 to 2018, then $384 billion from 2019 to 2021, and $440 billion from the end of 2022 to 2025. The realized cap increases particularly quickly in the last year of each Bitcoin cycle, 2017 and 2021, which would suggest Bitcoin could experience a similar inflow of capital in 2025.",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|MNT|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-18 16:00:05

Find out what has made analysts so bullish as to predict 50x gains for Rollblock in the coming months. Rollblock leads the way in casino innovation Rollblock is not just yet another entry in the crowded casino market but a totally new model for how web3 gaming can operate. Rollblock offers its gamers a choice from over 7,000 casino classics, including poker and roulette, as well as a growing sports betting feature that has proven especially popular in recent weeks. The entire platform is underpinned by Rollblock blockchain transparency, reshaping how gamers can verify their transactions using the Ethereum blockchain. No longer will users run the risk of their bets being fixed or manipulated in an industry often criticized for its shady goings-on. Rollblock recently saw a huge rise in new registrations, which spiked by 600% in December alongside $1.75 million in wagered bets placed on the platform. Rollblock’s revenue-sharing model is a standout feature as 30% of daily profits are used for RBLK buybacks. 60% of these tokens are burned to increase the scarcity of its supply, and 40% is allocated to staking rewards so that gamers can enjoy up to 30% APY on their holdings. This will escalate the value of RBLK as investors are much more likely to hold long-term.

In the last 24 hours, Ripple has gained 7% to reach $3.26, meaning this token is now just 4% away from its all-time high from 2018. Ripple has seen an astonishing 41% pump in the last 15 days and led the entire crypto top 10 with its recent rally. Ripple is also outperforming Bitcoin in Google trends as search volume has been on the rise for weeks. As soon as Ripple enters price discovery, it looks ready for a parabolic breakout that could target $10 during Q1 of 2025. Cardano makes inroads into Argentinian infrastructure Cardano has also enjoyed an incredible day of trading, as the price of Cardano is up by 7.9% today to hit $1.12. Cardano is leading the way, incorporating smart contract technology into Argentinian government services, as Cardano will play a part in recording the country’s social security benefits system as well as union records and a new student identity tracking system. This major development has yet to be priced in, as Cardano could easily reach $5 in Q1 based on this adoption. Cardano support looks well established at $0.77 and should bounce from this level in the event of a crash. Rollblock will change the massive GambleFi sector this year Rollblock is in a far more bullish position than Ripple and Cardano thanks to its tiny market cap and massive recent growth. It also looks set to outpace Solana in the coming bull run as it overturns the $500 billion gaming industry.

Donald Trump the Bull (DONBULL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONBULL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Trump the Bull can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Trump the Bull could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Trump the Bull launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Trump the Bull on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Donald Trump the Bull by entering its contract address – AmgaL1uuQ97qJoXfUUxdHipLJmVd3toChivEBiSFn7MW – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONBULL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-18 16:05:00

Ripple’s potential use in U.S. national debt repayment has sparked heated discussions among investors. With growing adoption and market interest, the question remains could XRP realistically achieve the ambitious $1,000 price target? Here’s Why XRP Price Could Reach $1,000 The potential for XRP, the cryptocurrency developed by Ripple Labs, to reach extraordinary price levels has sparked countless debates among analysts and enthusiasts. While such predictions remain speculative, exploring hypothetical scenarios can offer insight into what could drive XRP’s value to $1,000 or beyond. Below are five key scenarios that outline possible paths for XRP’s future growth. Massive Adoption as the Global Payments Standard If XRP becomes the go-to solution for cross-border transactions, it could revolutionize the financial system. Its speed, efficiency, and low transaction costs make it attractive for banks, corporations, and even governments. If XRP price achieve this level of adoption, experts believe its price could rise to between $10 and $50. Recognition as a Global Reserve Currency A more ambitious scenario envisions XRP being recognized as a global reserve currency, held by central banks alongside traditional assets like the U.S. dollar or gold. Such status would dramatically increase demand for XRP, with its price potentially soaring to $50-$200. This transformation would require widespread trust in XRP’s stability and Ripple’s ecosystem. XRP Powers CBDCs Globally Central banks around the world adopting XRP as the foundation for their central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could drive unprecedented demand. Ripple’s ongoing partnerships with financial institutions and regulators position XRP as a contender for this role. In such a case, analysts speculate that XRP could reach a valuation between $200 and $1,000. Market Cap Matches Bitcoin’s Current Level If XRP’s market capitalization were to reach the Bitcoin current valuation of around $1 trillion, its price could climb to $500-$2,000. Achieving this milestone would depend on shifting investor sentiment and significant growth in adoption by institutional and retail markets. XRP as a Digital Store of Value XRP price could also transition into a widely accepted store of value, similar to gold. In this role, it would serve as a hedge against economic uncertainty, driving its price to between $1,000 and $5,000. However, achieving this requires a fundamental shift in perception about XRP’s utility and long-term potential. Ripple Price Analysis As of Saturday, the value of XRP is trading at $3.19, reflecting a 4% decrease over the last 24-hours. The cryptocurrency has been consolidating above the crucial $3.00 support level after a recent rally. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) reads 57, signaling that XRP remains in neutral territory but closer to overbought levels. XRP has a target of $3.50 if the bulls regain momentum. A break above $3.50 could open the path toward $3.84, a critical resistance level near the all-time high (ATH). Conversely, a failure to maintain the $3.00 support could lead to a pullback toward $2.80. XRP Price Chart: TradingView While the above scenarios present exciting possibilities for XRP, they are purely speculative and intended for entertainment purposes. Market dynamics, adoption rates, and regulatory developments will ultimately shape XRP’s future.

For early investors, the returns have been life-changing. A modest $10,000 investment at launch is now worth an incredible $1.2 million, highlighting the massive potential of this viral asset. As the TRUMP coin continues to dominate headlines, speculation is growing about whether this is a short-lived hype or the start of a new trend in the crypto space. With such explosive growth, all eyes are on this unprecedented meme coin’s next move. TRUMP Becomes The Biggest Meme Coin In History At 9:44 PM ET on an otherwise quiet Friday night, President-elect Donald Trump made history by launching the $TRUMP meme coin, which has already become the biggest meme coin phenomenon the market has ever seen. According to The Kobbeissi Letter, a trusted voice in global capital markets commentary, TRUMP is up a staggering 9,500%, with $2.2 billion in trading volume within just 12 hours of its launch. Initially met with skepticism, the announcement of $TRUMP’s launch seemed so implausible that many traders assumed Trump’s account had been hacked. However, with no official statement refuting the coin’s legitimacy, confidence grew—and so did the price. Related Reading: Ondo Finance Funding Rate Signals Greed Among Investors – Sign Of Strength? By 12:45 AM ET, TRUMP had broken above $10, accelerating into a parabolic rally. In the early hours, traders witnessed unprecedented returns. One investor reportedly turned $50,000 into nearly $1.1 million in just two hours. Remarkably, TRUMP outperformed the S&P 500’s 30-year cumulative return within that same short window. A key factor driving the coin’s explosive price action is its limited circulating supply. Only 20% of the maximum supply—200 million coins—is currently on the market. Over the next 36 months, the remaining 800 million coins will gradually be released. Speculation is rife that Trump himself holds this undistributed portion, potentially giving him substantial control over the asset. With $TRUMP already establishing itself as a phenomenon, the coin’s trajectory remains a captivating spectacle. This unprecedented rally and intrigue surrounding its supply mechanics have cemented it as one of the most extraordinary stories in crypto history. Price Action And Market Cap Details The explosive rise of the TRUMP coin has prompted questions about its Market Cap and Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV). With a total supply of 1 billion coins, the FDV—if all tokens were circulating—would stand at approximately $21 billion based on current prices. However, since only 200 million coins (20% of the total supply) are currently in circulation, the market cap is approximately $4.2 billion. This significant disparity highlights the impact of circulating supply on valuation metrics.

There is little data to conduct meaningful technical analysis. The TRUMP chart essentially consists of a parabolic green candle, reflecting its meteoric rise in an hype-dominated environment. This leaves the market with one critical question: can demand sustain current levels as the remaining 80% of the supply gradually enters circulation? The TRUMP emission schedule outlines how the maximum supply will be reached over the next 36 months. Skeptics argue that this influx of supply could lead to oversaturation, ultimately sending the coin’s price plummeting to $0. On the other hand, bulls believe the schedule’s gradual nature allows demand to keep pace. This could mitigate the risk of significant price dilution. For now, the debate continues.
