On-chain metrics show increasing whale accumulation, showcasing faith in the direction of XRP in the near term. But before XRP is basking in the spotlight, investors are eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi utility token currently at just $0.035. With its Stage 6 presale more than 60% complete with over 16,770 holders, Mutuum Finance is slowly but surely emerging as the next crypto to explode, with early-stage expansion potential being derived from a well-founded fundamentals platform which most feel has the potential to outperform even top altcoins this quarter. XRP at Crossroads as Bulls and Bears Wage War for Control XRP is closely banded at writing in the $3 level, with traders watching how long the bulls will hold. A breakdown of this level can unlock a $500 million long squeeze that can move the price as low as $2.89–$2.73 levels. In the other case if the bullish pressure continues, XRP can see stop-run rallies test levels of $3.20–$3.40 as buyers sustain important support levels. During this risky liquidity war, interest is shifting to newer altcoins with more well-structured growth potential, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one such utility-driven entrant that is gaining growing interest from investors. Mutuum Finance Presale Frenzy Suggests Market Confidence Boost Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is giving early investors a special opportunity to buy tokens at a discounted rate before public listing. Phase 6 tokens at $0.035 have already seen high demand, raising more than $16.9 million from more than 16,770 buyers. Such high participation indicates increased global faith in the long-term potential of the project and DeFi vision. As a token of appreciation to its early adopters, Mutuum Finance is offering $100,000 giveaway in a competition in which 10 lucky winners will receive $10,000 MUTM tokens each. It also incentivizes early adoption, participation, and loyalty from the community. Mutuum Finance places utmost priority on security. With the help of CertiK, the project has initiated a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. White-hat hackers, developers, and security experts are invited to report vulnerabilities, which are ranked in severity: critical, major, minor, and low, and rewarded in proportion. Even small errors are fixed in real-time to provide the optimal platform security. Next-Generation Lending and Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance will launch its revolutionary lending and borrowing protocol , solidifying its position in DeFi even more. Version 1 (V1) will be released on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, and its key components will include a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. The protocol will also provide ETH and USDT lending, borrowing, and collateralization from day one. The platform is designed for usability, scalability, and speed and aims to provide secure DeFi to retail and institutional clients. Mutuum Finance applies dynamic Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and liquidation levels in real-time, automatically calibrating against market conditions in order to be shielded from volatility. Reserve multipliers ranging from 10% on low-risk assets to 35% on high-risk assets also offer a level of protection. Collateral management is designed to maximize borrowing power and matched collateral for lending and borrowing efficiency. Remediation charges and undercollateralized position charges in real-time stabilize the platform, reduce systemic risk, and ensure a safe, stable, and resilient DeFi environment. Ripple (XRP) vs Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Comparison As Ripple (XRP) tees up for a solid Uptober, tightrope walking between support levels at $3 and potential rallies toward $5, investors are searching increasingly for early-stage, high-utility substitutes within the DeFi space. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is at a low of only $0.035 and over 60% of Stage 6 presale sold, is a strong play. Its dual lending protocol, next-gen borrowing/lending platform, adaptive Loan-to-Value ratios, and strong collateral management provide security with scalability and will be ideal for retail as well as institutional players. With bug bounty programs, community incentives, and a clear-cut presale, MUTM blends prospective early adoption with real-world DeFi use cases to make it one of the best under-$1 cryptos to watch this quarter.

Recent analysis from crypto researchers reveals that the token is not waiting for a direct partnership with SWIFT. Instead, Ripple’s technology is making inroads through a network of third-party fintech providers that already connect to SWIFT, offering multiple entry points or backdoor routes to the network’s 11,000 financial institutions. Fintech Providers To Enable XRP To Flow Through SWIFT According to crypto enthusiast Peter Bourg, a recent thread by market researcher “@SMQKEDQG” on X social media outlined how seven prominent fintech firms are serving as active bridges between XRP and SWIFT. These companies—ACI, EastNets, Finastra, TAS, Temenos, Volange, and CGI—already support ISO 20022 -compliant cross-border payment systems. This means they can handle data-rich financial messages that enable faster, more transparent, and standardized settlement. Bourg added that Thunes , another fintech network with significant global reach, can now be added to the list, reinforcing XRP’s growing access to SWIFT’s ecosystem. He stated that with this collective fintech framework, there would be no need for a direct XRP-SWIFT collaboration . Instead, the cryptocurrency would leverage existing SWIFT-connected infrastructure that already has compliance and certification under the global telecommunications network’s evolving payment standards. Based on Bourg’s post, partnerships such as Ripple’s alliance with Finastra since 2019 and its integration with Temenos for real-time settlements are tangible examples of how the altcoin can easily move within SWIFT’s system. He says that these integrations provide verified “entry points” that adhere to CBPR+ standards for blockchain and interoperability , into SWIFT’s 11,000 institutions. The crypto enthusiast also highlighted SWIFT’s recent shift toward an API-based messaging structure through its new Transaction Management Platform (TMP), noting that the move further supports XRP’s role in faster settlements. He added that this transformation challenges the narrative of unproven competitors while underscoring the strength of SWIFT’s existing infrastructure . Interestingly, a member of the XRP community questioned whether these seven fintech firms could represent the 14% of SWIFT’s volume that Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, mentioned months ago. Bourg responded, cautioning that the true value of the firms does not lie in percentages but in adoption. How ISO 20022 And CBPR+ Are Powering The Token’s Entry Into SWIFT Going back to Bourg’s referenced analysis by crypto expert SMQKE on X, the post elaborated that XRP’s pathway into SWIFT’s network is already operational through the previously mentioned third-party fintech providers. He noted that the integrated strategy hinges on Ripple aligning with global standards , specifically ISO 20022 and CBPR+. ISO 20022 provides a universal language for electronic payments, while CBPR+ extends this to cross-border transactions, ensuring compatibility between blockchain and traditional financial systems. SMQKE explained that Ripple’s fintech partners provide the technological backbone that allows the XRP Ledger to process and settle international payments with speed and transparency, without breaching SWIFT’s compliance rules or requiring explicit endorsement. Through these connections, XRP can also move across borders more efficiently, serving as a bridge currency between fiat pairs.",XRP|ACI|Brad Garlinghouse|CBPR+|CGI|EastNets|Finastra|Peter Bourg|ripple|SMQKE|SWIFT|TAS|Temenos|TMP|Transaction Management Platform|Volange|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-07 22:00:25

This comes as the flagship crypto continues to hit new all-time highs (ATHs), with the $130,000 target now in sight. Bitcoin Supply On Exchanges Hit Six-Year Low Glassnode data shows that the Bitcoin supply on exchanges has fallen to a six-year low of around 2.8 million BTC. The last time the BTC balance on exchanges was this low was in June 2019, when the flagship crypto was trading at around $8,745. This development confirms that investors are accumulating Bitcoin at an unprecedented pace. CryptoQuant data also confirms this development, with the Bitcoin exchange reserve currently at 2.5 million BTC, even lower than what is shown on Glassnode’s dashboard. This is bullish for the BTC price, as such massive demand usually precedes a major supply squeeze. Notably, this comes amid an increased demand from institutional investors, with the BTC ETFs recording $3.2 billion in weekly inflows last week, their second-largest since their launch last year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Still On Track To Hit $165,000, JPMorgan Analysts Reveal Timeline This comes as institutional investors move to Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset as part of the debasement trade during this period of uncertainty caused by the U.S. government shutdown. Thanks to the increased demand, BTC is already up 9% to start this month and rallied to multiple all-time highs amid the ‘Uptober’ rally. The Bitcoin price topped $126,000 for the first time ever yesterday and now looks on course to test the $130,000 milestone. With the massive demand from the BTC ETFs, there is the belief that the flagship crypto could hit this milestone this month. SoSo Value data shows that these funds took in $1.19 billion in net inflows yesterday, their highest daily inflow this year. BTC Could Break Above $130,000 Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has suggested that Bitcoin is on track to make a new all-time high (ATH) above $130,000. He noted that BTC is testing the same trendline that rejected it a few weeks ago. However, this time around, the weekly MACD is crossing bullish, which could spark the rally above $130,000. His accompanying chart showed that a rally to as high as $140,000 was a possibility if the flagship crypto flips $130,000 into support. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s 2021 Playbook Shows The Final Price Target For This Bull Cycle Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also noted that Bitcoin is currently facing resistance around its current price level, making it a key level to watch. He added that a meaningful breakout above this level will send BTC to between $136,000 and $150,000. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $124,500, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The rally follows growing optimism around a newly propose blockchain. APT’s resurgence comes at a time when the broader market is recovering from short-term volatility, with Bitcoin consolidating near $122,000 and Ethereum climbing above $4,500. The combination of institutional attention and improved network activity has pushed Aptos back into the spotlight as traders look for the next breakout asset. At the same time, retail investors seeking even higher upside are turning toward early-stage opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-rising presale project that analysts believe could deliver up to 50x returns after listing. Aptos-linked ETF filing in Europe, which has reignited interest in the high-performance Layer- ETF Filing Sparks Renewed Optimism The Aptos ETF proposal submitted by a European asset management firm is being viewed as a major step toward broader institutional adoption of emerging blockchain networks. The filing, which aims to offer regulated exposure to APT, has already started shifting sentiment across the market. Unlike past cycles, this move highlights a growing willingness among financial institutions to back alternatives to Ethereum. Analysts note that if the ETF gains approval, the issuer would need to purchase APT directly, reducing circulating supply and potentially fueling further price appreciation. On-chain data supports this renewed optimism. Daily active addresses on the Aptos network have risen by 20 percent in the last month, and total transaction volume has reached a six-month high. Developer activity is also climbing as more decentralized applications begin integrating with the network’s Move-based smart contract system. Technical indicators suggest that if APT can hold above $5.40, the next target lies near the $6.20 zone. A clean breakout above that level could open the path to $7 and beyond, potentially marking a full recovery to its early-year highs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Next 50x Prospect While Aptos is seeing strong institutional interest, retail traders are chasing even higher potential returns – and MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the most talked-about presale project in that category. The token has already raised over $15.5 million, breaking multiple participation records in the process. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growing reputation is based on a combination of solid fundamentals and well-managed excitement. The project has been fully audited by HashEx and CertiK, providing investors with assurance that its code and tokenomics are secure. This emphasis on transparency has built confidence among small and mid-size investors who want exposure to early opportunities without excessive risk. What’s truly fueling the buzz, however, is the forecasted 50x upside potential . Analysts point to its low initial valuation, strong community backing, and limited supply as key reasons why MAGACOIN could outperform established tokens once it lists on major exchanges. Unlike speculative meme coins, MAGACOIN’s development roadmap focuses on long-term ecosystem growth and community governance. The project’s commitment to continuous progress, rather than short-term marketing, is helping it stand out as one of the few presales that balance ambition with accountability. Institutional Momentum and Market Rotation The Aptos ETF filing is also part of a broader trend of renewed institutional engagement with altcoins. After the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, large funds are diversifying into new blockchain ecosystems. Analysts believe that as institutional exposure widens, confidence in the altcoin sector will grow, paving the way for fresh capital inflows. Meanwhile, retail investors are taking advantage of this momentum by moving into smaller, high-upside assets. The ongoing market rotation is shifting liquidity from large caps into emerging tokens and presales. This pattern often precedes major altcoin rallies, as smaller projects gain traction ahead of widespread recognition. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s strong presale performance fits perfectly within this trend. With early investors securing low entry prices and the project gaining international attention, it has become a leading example of where the market’s most active retail segment is placing its bets. Outlook for Aptos and the Wider Market Aptos has regained its reputation as one of the fastest-growing Layer-1 ecosystems thanks to a mix of strong fundamentals, new institutional exposure, and rising developer engagement. If the ETF filing advances smoothly, it could further strengthen Aptos’ position as one of the top-performing networks of 2025. At the same time, the explosive demand for presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE shows that the appetite for early-stage growth remains alive and well. With projections of up to 50x returns, it is capturing the same kind of enthusiasm that once surrounded now-established tokens like Solana and Avalanche during their formative years. Conclusion Aptos’ 30% weekly surge has reminded investors that strong narratives and institutional moves still drive market momentum. The ETF filing has brought new energy to the project and positioned APT as a key player in the next stage of the bull market. But while Aptos appeals to institutions, retail investors are gravitating toward the early growth phase of MAGACOIN FINANCE – a project designed to combine long-term structure with the potential for exponential returns. Together, they reflect the two sides of crypto’s future: institutional maturity and retail innovation.

The altcoin has been pressing against the level since the weekend, sitting at a critical crossroads between a breakout and a rejection.

Source: TradingView. Flipping this level to support would confirm the move, targeting a retest of the $3.68 high and a potential 80% move to $5.25 . However, momentum indicators caution a rejection. The RSI has plummeted below the neutral line with today’s XRP price drawdown, suggesting mounting sell pressure. It appears enough to affect the wider trend, with the MACD en route to cross below the signal line in a potential death cross—often a marker of local tops for the XRP price. In this scenario, $2.70 is the key XRP price floor to maintain the pattern’s structure. Losing it could open the door to a steeper 30% decline toward June lows at $1.90.

According to data from Farside Investors, Bitcoin ETFs attracted $1.19 billion in net inflows on Monday, the highest single-day total since July 10, when inflows reached $1.18 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated the surge, accounting for more than 81% of total inflows with $970 million added in a single day. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) followed with $112.3 million, while Bitwise’s BITB recorded $60.1 million. BlackRock’s IBIT Leads Record $6B Crypto ETF Inflows The renewed appetite for Bitcoin exposure coincides with a major milestone for BlackRock’s IBIT, which has now overtaken some of the firm’s legacy funds to become its highest-revenue-generating ETF. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that IBIT is now “a hair away from $100 billion” in assets under management (AUM), just 21 months after launch. $IBIT a hair away from $100 billion, is now the most profitable ETF for BlackRock by a good amount now based on current aum. Check out the ages of the rest of the Top 10. Absurd. pic.twitter.com/E8ZMI2wynx — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 6, 2025 The fund currently manages $98.47 billion across 1.38 billion shares with a 0.25% fee, generating roughly $244 million in annual revenue for the world’s largest asset manager. Monday’s inflows also capped off a record week for Bitcoin-linked investment products. Data from CoinShares showed that digital asset funds globally attracted $5.95 billion last week, the largest weekly inflow on record. Source: CoinShares Bitcoin accounted for $3.55 billion of that figure, while Ethereum saw $1.48 billion, followed by Solana and XRP with $706.5 million and $219.4 million, respectively. Bitcoin itself has been trading just below all-time highs, hovering around $124,500 on Tuesday after briefly crossing $126,000 earlier in the week. The latest surge came as institutional traders piled in over the weekend, sending Bitcoin past $125,000 for the first time since August. October has historically been one of Bitcoin’s stronger months, and the token is already up more than 10% since the start of the month. Data from SoSoValue shows that as of October 6, total cumulative net inflows into U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs reached $61.26 billion, with total assets under management now at $169.54 billion, representing about 6.8% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Source: SoSoValue Meanwhile, Ethereum spot ETFs have also benefited from the broader crypto rebound. As of October 6, they recorded $181.7 million in daily inflows and $14.6 billion in cumulative inflows, with total net assets now sitting at $32 billion, about 5.6% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Bitcoin Faces Short-Term Correction After Record Rally, Analysts Eye Key Support Levels Bitcoin slipped 4.2% on Tuesday to around $122,000 after hitting an all-time high of $126,219 the previous day, pausing a week-long 12.5% surge. While the pullback sparked concerns of a deeper correction, derivatives data and institutional flows suggest the broader uptrend remains intact. Bitcoin monthly futures continue to trade at an 8% annualized premium over spot prices, a level that reflects steady optimism without signs of speculative overheating. Analysts say this moderation helps reduce liquidation risk if prices fall further. The rally that began after Bitcoin’s $109,000 retest in late September appears supported by genuine inflows, with bulls defending the $120,000 zone. Exchange data reinforces that narrative. Glassnode reports Bitcoin balances on trading platforms have dropped to a five-year low of 2.38 million BTC, down from 2.99 million a month earlier, indicating ongoing accumulation. The firm also identifies strong support near $117,000, where around 190,000 BTC last changed hands. Open interest in Bitcoin futures stands at $72 billion, slightly lower on the day but still showing deep market participation. Meanwhile, VanEck analysts project Bitcoin could eventually capture half of gold’s market capitalization, potentially reaching $644,000 per coin. Technically, Bitcoin is testing key support near its 200-day exponential moving average around $122,900. Analyst Ted Pillow noted that momentum has weakened after the failure to hold above $125,000. As said yesterday, $BTC is losing steam. Bitcoin is testing key support around the 200 EMA (~$122,900). Showing weakening short-term momentum after failing to hold recent highs.

Short-term charts show Bitcoin consolidating between a seller zone at $123,000–$125,000 and a strong buyer zone near $112,000–$114,000. Multiple rejections around the upper band suggest short-term exhaustion, though the broader structure remains bullish. Market analysts say a correction toward $118,000 would be a “healthy retracement” within Bitcoin’s larger uptrend, a phase that could reset leverage and prepare the market for another leg higher.

The token is up 21% year-to-date, making it the weakest performer in the top five, while Ethereum and BNB Coin have already hit new all-time highs with gains of 41% and 85% respectively. But that could be about to change. In September, Solana validators approved the Alpenglow upgrade – a major technical enhancement that will reduce block times from 12 seconds to just 150 milliseconds, bringing Solana closer than ever to real-time speed. The network already ranks third in total value locked for real-world assets, with $14.7 billion in stablecoins and tokenized assets – double that of BNB Chain, though still behind Ethereum’s $183 billion. Still, with Wall Street increasingly moving into tokenization, Alpenglow could position Solana at the center of the next wave of institutional crypto adoption. And if momentum builds, the road to $1,000 SOL might arrive sooner than expected. Solana Price Prediction: Big Upside Potential If SOL Breaks Through $300 Solana has found firm support at the $200 psychological level during the latest market dip, and now looks primed to make a move toward new all-time highs. With altcoin season heating up , SOL may soon start catching up to top performers like BNB Coin (BNB) and Ethereum (ETH) . The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has just flashed a buy signal, crossing above its 14-day moving average while gaining strength near the mid-line. If momentum pushes SOL beyond $300 , it could trigger the next leg of the rally – and open the door for a longer-term move toward $1,000 . Alongside major altcoins, top crypto presales are gaining serious attention, offering early access to potential breakout projects. One project that is currently gaining attention is SUBBD ($SUBBD) , a decentralized content platform built for the AI era. It’s gaining traction fast as investors look for early access to the next breakout presale. SUBBD ($SUBBD) Gives Creators the Chance to Monetize AI-Generated Content SUBBD ($SUBBD) is reshaping how creators make, share, and monetize their work by merging AI tools with blockchain technology in one seamless platform.

Bitcoin price outlook: BTC near $122k with upside potential to $140k by year-end—read analyst insights and key signals to watch. Learn more. What is the Bitcoin price outlook? Bitcoin price outlook shows continued upside potential after a recent pullback from record highs. Short-term volatility is expected, but macro factors—rising fiscal deficits, lower real rates, and ETF inflows—support further appreciation as investors seek hedges against dollar weakness. Could Bitcoin reach $140,000 by year-end? Analysts cited by COINOTAG believe BTC could surpass $140,000 by year-end if institutional demand and the so-called debasement trade persist. Bitcoin recently traded at $122,071, down 3.1% from a $126,080 peak, according to CoinGecko. Hashdex highlighted BTC’s narrative as a borderless store-of-value, while Pepperstone noted rising ETF holdings and inflows as validation. How can investors assess Bitcoin’s outlook? Track capital flows: Monitor ETF inflows and institutional position reports to gauge demand trends. Watch macro signals: Rising U.S. fiscal deficits, falling real rates, and dollar weakness typically support the debasement trade. Compare safe-haven assets: Evaluate correlations with gold and other hedges to confirm flight-to-quality behavior. Consider volatility: Expect pullbacks; use position sizing and risk management when reacting to headlines. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin price outlook: Analysts say BTC could top $140,000 as ETF inflows and debasement trade drive demand"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": """" } }, ""description"": ""Bitcoin price outlook: BTC near $122k after record highs.

Watch ETF flows, institutional inflows, on-chain accumulation, and key macro releases (inflation, interest rate guidance). Short-term liquidity and news-driven volatility can cause rapid moves. Why are analysts comparing Bitcoin to gold? Analysts say Bitcoin and gold share hedge characteristics against currency debasement. Rising ETF holdings and institutional adoption strengthen Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative similar to gold. Key Takeaways Macro support : Fiscal deficits and falling real rates underpin interest in hedges like BTC and gold. Institutional demand : ETF inflows and rising holdings signal growing professional adoption. Risk management : Expect volatility; use disciplined sizing and monitor macro updates. Conclusion The Bitcoin price outlook remains constructive despite short-term retracements.

52815721,https://cryptonews.com/?p=434239,1759876200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52815721.jpeg,"Best Crypto to Buy Now 7 October – XRP, Plasma, Bittensor",https://cryptonews.com/news/best-crypto-to-buy-now-7-october-xrp-plasma-bittensor/,"Just yesterday, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high (ATH) of $126,080 just hours after it previously hit a new high watermark of $125,506. These were its significant first movements since it clocked new high ATHs in August and July. Despite BTC commanding the spotlight, an increasing flow of strategic capital is moving toward altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have already achieved fresh record levels this year. Washington is also preparing an accommodating regulatory landscape for crypto. First, President Trump’s GENIUS Act, the nation’s inaugural legislative framework recognizing and regulating stablecoins, has provided long-awaited clarity for both issuers and users. Soon after, the SEC introduced its Project Crypto initiative, representing a bold step toward modernizing securities laws for digital assets. Together, these developments signal a decisive leap forward for institutional participation in crypto markets. With confidence building, coins such as XRP, Plasma, and Bittensor are quickly emerging as standout contenders for traders hunting the next explosive move. Ripple ($XRP): Best Cross-Border Payment Crypto and Standout Altcoin of 2025 The core advantage of Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) lies in its fast, low-cost settlement system designed for international money transfers, posing a challenge to long-standing systems like SWIFT. It’s so good at what it does that the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House are watching. Ripple’s growing influence was further highlighted when CEO Brad Garlinghouse participated in a closed-door White House crypto policy roundtable earlier this year. The company’s rollout of RLUSD, a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin, emphasizes Ripple’s ambition to secure a major foothold in the rapidly expanding and vital stablecoin sector. Over the last year, XRP has surged 456%, rocketing to its first new peak in seven years, hitting $3.65 on July 18 before easing roughly 18% to around $2.99. Still, it has outperformed Bitcoin’s 96% gain over the same period by nearly fivefold. Currently, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 53, reflecting gradually strengthening buying pressure as investors wait for a definitive bullish breakout signal. While catalysts like interest rate cuts and the approval of the first spot XRP ETF, both last month, did not spark an immediate rally (likely due to being priced in), traders remain optimistic. The formation of two bull flags over the summer hints at an upcoming breakout. With additional spot ETF decisions expected by the US SEC by mid-October, analysts project potential price targets between $5 and $10, with upside beyond that if momentum holds. Plasma ($XPL): Touting Itself as the Best Stablecoin Rails, This Crypto Could Blow Sky High Plasma (XPL) is a high-speed Layer 1 blockchain designed for fast, cost-free stablecoin payments, particularly with USDT. Its unique Paymaster system eliminates fees for basic transactions, making global transfers instant and affordable. The team essentially touts it as Money 2.0. If Bill Gates’s vision with Microsoft was simple: to put a computer in every home, then Plasma echoes that. They want everyone in the world, banked or otherwise, to have equal and permissionless access to the greenback in digital form. The XPL token secures the proof-of-stake network, supports staking, and will play a role in future governance. With a circulating supply of 1.8 billion tokens and a market cap of over $1.7 billion, XPL trades at roughly $0.99 and ranks among the top 100 cryptocurrencies. In the last 24 hours, Plasma blew up 13%, so now its RSI is downtrending from 51 as traders do a sport of recent profittaking. Considering the rest of the market is entering a bull cycle, this is not likely to bottom out very far, but should the selloff pickup pace, Plasma will quickly find support at $0.83. Ultimately, bull will be eyeing the $2 price target through Uptober. It’s possible, but substantial movements will likely be contingent on a positive news cycle for stablecoins. Additionally, they’re likely to find some resistance at $1.68, which is XPL’s ATH, set three days after launch. Bittensor ($TAO) Best Performing AI Crypto in Line for Further Substantial Gains Bittensor (TAO) is a crypto that merges blockchain with machine learning, enabling collaborative AI model training where participants earn rewards based on the value their contributions provide to the collective. This open-source protocol creates a permissionless marketplace for artificial intelligence, fostering innovation in a trustless environment. Fully compatible with Ethereum tools, Bittensor supports staking for network security and uses a proof-of-intelligence consensus to validate contributions. It also offers privacy-focused mechanisms for data handling. The TAO token has a circulating supply of about 10 million tokens and a market cap of over $3.3 billion, and currently trades at roughly $347 after rising 7% and posting the largest intraday gain among the top twenty AI coins . Any adverse market movements are likely to bottom out at $300, where TAO has solid psychological support. However, the appearance of a bullish flag across its support and resistance lines through August and September hints at the possibility of a strong end-of-year surge. Should that materialise, TAO could come close to challenging its ATH of $757.60 set in March last year. It would also result in the coin’s first substantial price peak in around a year. It last traded at $713 in December last year. TAO’s RSI is climbing up from 39 at a sharp angle. This means there could be more room for further gains by the weekend, but the token is fast approaching overbought and may dip to consolidate recent gains before next week. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): Meme-Powered Bitcoin Layer-2 and One of 2025’s Hottest Presales Elsewhere, in the presale arena, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is generating significant attention as one of the most anticipated crypto launches of 2025. The project blends Bitcoin’s unmatched security with Layer-2 scalability, while tapping into meme culture and community-driven governance for rapid growth. HYPER’s mission is to enhance Bitcoin’s utility, enabling faster payments, smart contracts, and decentralized governance through its next-generation Layer-2 infrastructure. So far, the presale has raised over $22.2 million, with market analysts forecasting potential 10× or greater returns upon its official release. Built on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER provides low-cost smart contracts, a Canonical Bridge for instant Bitcoin transfers, dApp integration, and smooth meme token and payment app compatibility. A recent Coinsult audit found no vulnerabilities, further boosting investor confidence. The HYPER token underpins staking, network fees, and governance throughout the ecosystem. Early participants can currently earn up to 53% APY through staking while gaining DAO voting privileges.

52815786,https://cryptonews.com/?p=434289,1759876200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52815786.jpeg,"Leading AI Claude Predicts the Price for XRP, Pepe and Pi Coin by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/leading-ai-claude-predicts-the-price-for-xrp-pepe-and-pi-coin-by-the-end-of-2025/,"Claude AI, Anthropic’s counterpart to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has issued a bullish forecast suggesting that XRP, Pepe, and Pi Network may all be positioning for unexpected new highs before the year is out. Bitcoin, the $2.5 trillion market heavyweight of the crypto sector, currently trades just 1% below its recent record of $126,080, set yesterday. Meanwhile, the rest of the digital asset market, now valued at $4.36 trillion, grew a modest 0.6% as several coins also clocked fresh new highs. Historically, October (aka “Uptober”) has been a strong month for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies overall, commonly serving as the launchpad for broader market rallies. New policy developments in the United States are helping cultivate the bullish sentiment. In July, President Trump enacted the GENIUS Act, America’s first federal law requiring full-reserve backing for stablecoins. Shortly afterward, the SEC unveiled its Project Crypto program, aimed at updating securities regulations for the digital asset era. With clearer rules emerging, the next altcoin cycle will surpass the unregulated frenzy of crypto’s historic 2021 bull run. If Claude’s analysis proves accurate, XRP, Pepe, and Pi Network may lead the next leg of the bull run. XRP (Ripple): Claude AI Projects EOY Price Range Comfortably Above $5 According to Claude AI’s latest projections, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb to as high as $6, which would represent an easy doubling from its current price near $2.98. XRP has already shown significant strength this year. After the SEC’s five-year lawsuit against Ripple concluded in Ripple’s favour, investors drove XRP’s price to $3.65 on July 18, its highest level since its 2018 peak of $3.40. Ripple continues to expand its payment network and drive institutional adoption across multiple markets. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund highlighted XRP as an efficient, low-cost remittance tool for developing nations. Ripple was also one of several crypto companies that appeared in the White House’s Digital Asset report. Claude AI suggests that if XRP can decisively break through its July high, it could achieve prices above $5 before year-end. However, many analysts, both human and machine, have higher targets, suggesting a run-up to $10 is not inconceivable with the right tailwinds. Over the past year, XRP has appreciated 456%, making it the top performer among the major unbacked cryptocurrencies. For comparison, Bitcoin rose 96%, while Ethereum added 92%. Technical charts show three bullish flag formations appearing throughout 2025, two of which formed during the summer, indicating strong breakout potential heading into the final quarter of the year. Although last month’s Federal Reserve rate cuts and the approval of the first spot XRP ETF didn’t immediately drive prices higher, analysts believe that Uptober’s seasonal momentum, additional US ETF greenlights this month, and new U.S. crypto legislation expected before year-end could act as powerful catalysts. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin With 10× Upside Potential, According to Claude AI Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) has rapidly become a top-three meme cryptocurrency, boasting a market cap of $4.2 billion, the largest among non-dog-themed meme tokens. Its unique cultural angle draws inspiration from Matt Furie’s Boy’s Club comics. Despite facing tough competition, Pepe’s robust liquidity and strong community support have helped sustain its popularity. Elon Musk has even referenced owning Pepe alongside Dogecoin on X, giving the token an additional visibility boost. Currently trading around $0.00001, Pepe has pulled back 64.5% from an ATH of $0.00002803, set on December 9, 2024, but continues to maintain critical support levels. A breakout above $0.000018 could clear the path towards $0.000023 by late November. Claude AI’s optimistic scenario envisions Pepe potentially topping at $0.000028, a near 3× gain from current levels. While Pepe’s already large valuation might limit growth, the token could still easily outperform Claude’s predictions in the next market surge. Pepe currently has a very neutral RSI of 50, which suggests it’s neither overbought nor oversold, giving it plenty of headroom to go either way. Should recent crypto market strength persist over the week, Pepe is more likely to enter the weekend above $0.000012. With improving regulatory clarity in the U.S., Pepe has the potential for even greater upside as investor confidence builds in the market as a whole, which is, of course, historically a big catalyst for meme coins. Pi Network ($PI): Claude AI Predicts Mobile Mining Innovator Could Hit $1 Pi Network ($PI) pioneered the “tap-to-mine” concept, enabling users to earn tokens directly from their smartphones by simply logging in daily and tapping the app. Now trading near $0.2623, Claude AI outlines a potential 4x surge to $1 before the year ends. It says in an ultra-bullish scenario, $PI could even hit $520, a 2000× gain from current prices. However, given the realities of its price performance over the year, this is extremely unlikely. However, the good news is that the project’s continuous ecosystem development and forthcoming milestones could support Claude’s sober bullish case. The team has been releasing steady updates, moving from version 19 to 23, with a mainnet debut on the immediate horizon, events that could serve as significant price drivers. Since its February 2025 debut, Pi has experienced heavy volatility, including a 171% jump in May. Its current RSI of around 31 indicates heavy selling and possible undervaluation. It also implies a rebound might be imminent, making this an attractive entry point for long-term believers. Retesting February’s high of $2.99 remains an ambitious goal but not an impossible one. Even if that level isn’t reached, crypto’s traditional October strength could lift Pi more than halfway towards the $1 mark by November, setting the stage for a festive-season rally. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin Fueled by Community Hype While Claude AI’s data-centric forecast focuses mainly on major altcoins, one new project gaining traction is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , Dogecoin’s long-lost degen cousin. The team is marketing it with a pulse-pounding, gym-bro twist to appeal to speculative traders drawn to high-upside potential plays and community-driven excitement. Unlike Dogecoin, which has matured into a large-cap asset, Maxi Doge fully embraces its high-risk, high-reward ethos. Since launching only a couple of months ago, the project has raised more than $2.8 million. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI promotes engagement through Telegram and Discord communities, competitive trading events, and upcoming brand collaborations. Of the total 150.24 billion tokens, 25% goes to the “Maxi Fund” for marketing and partnerships. Staking is already live, offering yields up to 121% APY, though this is variable, which means returns decrease as more stakers join the pool. Currently, presale tokens are $0.000261, with nominal increases every few days as the presale passes through its funding levels. Investors can participate through the Maxi Doge website using MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

BNB memecoins show high retail profitability Approximately 100,000 wallets engaged; 70% are profitable per on-chain data (Bubblemaps). Top performers PALU and 4 recorded market caps of roughly $90M and $239M and produced multiple million-dollar traders. BNB memecoins surge: PALU and 4 lead gains with 70% of traders profitable — explore on-chain data and expert insight on COINOTAG today. What is driving the BNB memecoin surge? BNB memecoins are surging because concentrated whale clustering, strong secondary-market liquidity and intense retail interest have combined to lift several tokens rapidly. Short-term momentum, social amplification and low entry costs created a rapid price cascade that produced outsized profits for many traders. How many traders are profiting and what does the data show? On-chain analytics provider Bubblemaps reports that over 100,000 traders have entered the BNB memecoin wave, with about 70% currently holding unrealized gains. The dataset also highlighted roughly 40 wallets with >$1 million gains and about 900 wallets with six-figure profits, underscoring concentrated but broad retail participation. Source: X (as reported in on-chain analytics commentary) Which tokens are leading the rally? Two BNB-chain memecoins stand out for market cap and trader participation: PALU and 4 . Clustered accumulation patterns and high secondary turnover drove rapid market-cap expansion and notable retail returns. Token Approx. Market Cap Notable on-chain metrics PALU $90 million ~40,000 interacting traders; ~70% profitable 4 $239 million Largest BNB memecoin by value; 21+ million-dollar winners; 6,000+ profitable wallets These metrics suggest coordinated accumulation among top wallets and strong retail momentum. Concentrated activity can amplify price moves but also increases vulnerability when liquidity tightens. How concentrated are the gains? Profit concentration is notable: a relatively small subset of wallets captured the largest windfalls, while a much broader retail base booked smaller but meaningful gains. This mix reflects both coordinated whale activity and active retail trading. Source: X (on-chain visuals and trader maps) How does BNB’s memecoin cycle compare to Solana’s earlier rally? BNB’s current memecoin surge resembles Solana’s previous memecoin mania in social intensity and rapid token creation. However, early indicators differ: BNB retail participants appear more frequently in profit, while Solana later saw a high attrition rate among projects and traders. Market analyst Luke Martin noted that Solana experienced hundreds of thousands of launches with a small survival rate, whereas BNB’s current wave so far produced a higher proportion of profitable outcomes. As he summarized: “Binance szn continues until this gap closes.” Source: X Frequently Asked Questions Are BNB memecoins a safe investment right now? Memecoin rallies are high-risk and highly volatile. While many BNB traders are currently profitable, sudden liquidity withdrawals and concentrated whale activity can reverse gains quickly. Treat positions as speculative and size risk accordingly. How can I verify on-chain trader profits? Use on-chain analytics tools (plain text mention: Bubblemaps) to inspect wallet interactions, profit/loss heatmaps and concentration metrics. Look for sustained secondary-market trading and liquidity depth before assuming durability. Will the BNB memecoin rally sustain long term? Historically, memecoin rallies tend to be short-lived unless supported by persistent liquidity and broader ecosystem adoption. Present data show strong short-term gains; long-term sustainability remains uncertain and depends on liquidity and market structure. Key Takeaways Retail profitability: ~70% of on-chain BNB memecoin traders are in profit, indicating broad short-term gains. Concentration risk: Major gains are concentrated among a subset of wallets, suggesting coordinated accumulation. Volatility warning: Rapid exits or liquidity drying can erase gains; monitor liquidity and on-chain metrics closely. Conclusion BNB memecoins, led by PALU and 4, have produced substantial short-term gains for many traders, backed by concentrated accumulation and vibrant secondary-market activity. BNB memecoins remain highly speculative; readers should combine on-chain data with risk management and continued monitoring.

The meeting, which had been billed as a chance to reset relations, ended with smiles, quotes for the cameras, and no relief from the tariffs choking Canadian industries. Trump called Carney “a world-class leader” and “a tough negotiator,” but the Canadian leader went home empty-handed. Trump said, “We’ve come a long way over the last few months, actually, in terms of that relationship. I think they’re going to walk away very happy.” Carney, who praised Trump’s role in foreign policy during the meeting, heard the president respond, “We have great love for each other. We have a natural conflict.” The exchange summed up the odd balance of flattery and tension that has defined their dealings since Trump returned to the White House. Trump cracks jokes while Canada fails to get tariff relief Reporters pressed Trump on why Canada still had no deal while the European Union had already reached an agreement. Trump deflected, saying, “Because I want to be a great man, too,” drawing laughter in the room. The comments were lighthearted, but they left the fundamental question unanswered. Carney risked political backlash at home by attending without winning any concessions, as the tariffs remain on Canadian steel, aluminum, autos, copper, and softwood lumber. Canada’s 25 percent countertariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum are also still in place. The White House reception matched what Carney’s office had predicted in advance: a session designed to create progress rather than close an agreement. But the domestic cost is rising. Carney won the April election on promises to face down Trump and protect Canada’s economy from the tariff fight. Months later, Canada is still the only member of the G7 that hasn’t secured a deal to ease the duties. Ontario Premier Doug Ford told reporters in Toronto, “We need to hit back hard. You sure don’t sit back and get beat up by a bully every single day. It’s like a kid going in the school yard and getting punched in the face every day.” Ford added, “Maybe Prime Minister Carney knows something I don’t know. And if that’s the case, he should sit down with the premiers and explain that.” Canada’s United Steelworkers union director Marty Warren issued his own warning, saying, “We need urgent action — not more concessions. Canada’s softwood lumber industry is on the brink of collapse.” Carney turns to USMCA review while Trump revives old lines Carney has shifted some focus toward the 2026 mandatory review of the United States‑Mexico‑Canada Agreement. About 85 percent of Canadian exports are tariff‑exempt under the current arrangement, giving him another path to press his case. Trump indicated he may consider a bilateral arrangement with Canada, saying, “We’re allowed to do different deals if we want. I want to make whatever the best deal is for this country, and also very much with Canada in mind.” Despite months of friendlier exchanges, Trump has not abandoned his jabs. Just last week, he again called Canada the “51st state” while speaking to U.S. generals. And when Carney tried to praise Trump’s efforts in foreign conflicts, including India and Pakistan, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and Gaza, Trump interrupted him with, “The merger of Canada and the United States?” Carney shot back, “No! That wasn’t where I was going,” before laughing off the moment. It was not the first time they had confronted the subject. Back in May, during their first Oval Office meeting, Carney told Trump bluntly, “Canada is not for sale. Won’t be for sale, ever.” Trump responded, “Never say never,” but let it slide. Carney has managed to avoid the outbursts that marked Justin Trudeau’s clashes with Trump during the last administration. Trudeau had called the tariffs “very dumb” and accused Trump of siding with Vladimir Putin. Carney, by contrast, has kept steady contact through calls and text messages, keeping tensions from boiling over. Still, with tariffs biting and no breakthrough in Washington, the relationship looks weaker than ever. Trump closed the meeting by predicting, “I think the people of Canada, they will love us again.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

With $12.5 trillion in assets under management, the world’s biggest money manager is going hard on Bitcoin, AI, and European corporate credit. They’re pushing deep into sectors that others are still figuring out, locking down infrastructure, loading up on energy, and snapping up the kind of private assets that come with sky-high fees and low public oversight. At the center of this aggressive push is a deal by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), BlackRock’s recently acquired infrastructure arm, to buy Aligned Data Centers. This would rank as one of the largest data infrastructure buys of the year. GIP is also pushing to finalize the acquisition of Allete Inc., a utility firm based in Minnesota.Regulators are close to approving the deal, which would give BlackRock a direct connection to energy that can feed the growing data center demand. On top of that, they’ve been holding talks with AES Corp., a renewable power and utility giant with a $38 billion valuation. If that deal closes, it would become one of the largest utility takeovers ever recorded. BlackRock pours billions into AI power and crypto ETFs The timing isn’t random. AI needs insane levels of compute, and that compute runs on energy. BlackRock saw the writing on the wall when it shelled out $12.5 billion to buy GIP last year. CEO Larry Fink called it the start of a “golden age” for infrastructure. He wasn’t joking. This year, GIP joined forces with Microsoft, MGX, and later Nvidia and xAI, to raise $30 billion for AI and energy infrastructure. With leverage, they expect that pool to support $100 billion worth of projects. But AI isn’t the only game BlackRock is cornering. The firm’s Bitcoin ETF, known as IBIT, is about to smash the $100 billion asset mark. The fund, launched less than two years ago, charges a 0.25% fee and is already raking in over $240 million annually. Analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart from Bloomberg Intelligence say it’s the most profitable ETF in BlackRock’s entire lineup, and that’s out of more than 1,000 funds. What’s crazy is how fast it got there. IBIT is on track to hit $100 billion five times faster than any ETF in history. It’s now shorthand for the entire crypto ETF category, pulling in both retail and institutional flows like a vacuum. Private assets now make up only 5% of BlackRock’s total book, around $600 billion. But those assets bring in higher fees and are exactly what large strategic clients are after. Buying Aligned is a clear signal: BlackRock isn’t messing around with AI or data infrastructure. They want full ownership, control, and return. BlackRock shifts focus to European bonds and trims projections While crypto and AI dominate headlines, BlackRock is betting hard on European credit. In their latest fixed income report, they called European corporate bonds one of the “most compelling” options for global investors. With yields close to 3%, the firm sees them as one of the few places left offering steady income without taking major risk. “Companies still look in quite good shape overall,” said James Turner, co-head of global fixed income in EMEA. “There’s not many opportunities to find relatively safe yield at the moment.” Inflation forecasts are aligned with the ECB’s 2% target, growth is trending up, and credit markets continue pulling in capital. BlackRock favors banks, utilities, tech, media, and telecoms; sectors they say are shielded from tariffs. But not everything is pointing up. BofA Securities just dropped its price target for BlackRock stock (BLK) from $1,396 to $1,394, even though they kept their Buy rating. The company’s market cap sits at $182.6 billion. The stock is up 45.7% in the last six months, now hovering near its 52-week high of $1,184.12. Still, InvestingPro says it looks overvalued, with earnings expectations having been revised down across multiple periods. For Q3 2025, EPS was slashed from $12.41 to $11.17. Full-year 2025 projections fell to $47.38 from $48.59. Even with 15.45% revenue growth and a P/E ratio of 28.45x, analysts are starting to question the stock’s current price.

Bitcoin was trading near a fresh high at the time, which helped the comment spread quickly. Context Around The Claim Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $126,080 on Oct 7, 2025. At the same time, data cited by several outlets put global Bitcoin fund assets under management at about $200 billion. Those two figures were used by many market watchers to give the $1 trillion remark context: higher prices + rising fund flows = a much larger market for managed Bitcoin products. $1 trillion inbound…. https://t.co/6qTb3cOqg9 — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) October 6, 2025 Hougan’s post was not a detailed forecast. It was short and informal. According to coverage, many crypto sites simply reposted the message and tied it to recent ETF inflows and renewed institutional interest. The post did not include a timetable or the assumptions required to get from roughly $200 billion to $1 trillion, and the lack of detail left room for analysts to disagree. Market Reactions And Caution Several mainstream outlets treated the remark as bullish but urged caution. Reuters and other outlets pointed out that institutional adoption is still limited when compared to traditional asset classes. According to some analysts, getting to $1 trillion in Bitcoin fund AUM would mean a big, sustained shift by large investors such as pension plans and big wealth managers, not only short-term retail buying or a single strong month of inflows. Simple Math, Big Gaps If global fund AUM is about $200 billion now, reaching $1 trillion would mean a growth of five times that level. That implies adding roughly $800 billion in assets to crypto funds. Those are not small sums. They would require consistent flows over many months or years, plus choices by big institutions to allocate meaningful portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin. Related Reading: 2%–4% In Crypto? Morgan Stanley Thinks That’s The Smart Move Now What Needs To Happen Analysts say several things would have to happen for that scenario to play out. Based on reports, regulators would need to stay predictable, more large money managers would have to offer and scale Bitcoin products, and major institutional investors would have to shift part of their capital toward these funds. Hougan’s short message has, at minimum, renewed a public conversation about how big Bitcoin investment products might become.

With the company’s national bank charter decision expected soon, the timing of this reveal is drawing more attention. Ripple Executives Sign OCC Certification In June 2025 According to Xaif Crypto, the document shared on X shows an official OCC certification signed by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, and Timothy Keaney, dated June 30, 2025. The accreditation confirms that Ripple applied in accordance with U.S. federal banking regulations, a step required for forming a new financial institution. The document clearly states that all information provided in the filing was scrutinized, complete, and accurate as of the date of submission. The OCC certification document includes a declaration acknowledging that the OCC, the U.S. federal banking regulator, is responsible for approving the application. By signing the certification, Ripple’s top executives demonstrated the company’s clear intention to operate in accordance with U.S. banking laws and gain formal recognition as a trusted financial institution. XRP Community Reacts As National Bank Charter Decision Nears After Xaif Crypto shared the signed OCC document on X, the XRP community quickly began reacting. The post, which reads, “Docs signed by Stuart Alderoty & Timothy Keaney (June 30, 2025), Now all eyes on October,” is drawing strong attention and excitement, as Ripple’s national bank charter decision is pending this month. The timing of the OCC certification signed by Ripple executives has generated even more excitement across the crypto community, as many now believe U.S. regulators could soon recognize the crypto firm as a regulated financial institution. Ripple’s move toward regulatory certification from the OCC advances the fintech company’s plan to integrate XRP with traditional finance and gain recognition in the global market. By following this regulatory route, the fintech company could strengthen relationships with banks, payment firms, and large investors. This momentum could in turn increase market confidence in XRP and support the broader adoption of the digital asset in global markets. Ripple is steadily solidifying XRP’s place as a bridge currency between blockchain innovation and traditional finance . The OCC document shows Ripple’s growing commitment to meeting U.S. banking standards, hinting that the company may be preparing to launch an “XRP Bank” as early as October. As the October decision approaches, the crypto world is closely watching the OCC’s decision. Whether the OCC approves or not, the appearance of the signed certification has already made clear that Ripple is serious about its role in the U.S. financial system. For now, all eyes remain on what happens next as the company waits for the final charter decision this month.",Ripple|ripple|ripple news|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|FIAT|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-07 23:00:22

Some alts have enjoyed double-digit percentage gains within the last seven days, while the market as a whole has a reached a record total capitalization of $4.36 trillion. This is a reflection of rising institutional interest in crypto, and with a large number of altcoin ETFs set to launch by the end of the year, we could see even more big rallies very soon. It’s in this context that we provide a crypto price prediction for XRP, Solana and Shiba Inu, examining their technicals and fundamentals to predict where they could be by January. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Oversold Technicals and Incoming ETFs Are Recipe for Big Rally XRP has dipped a little today, although its drop to $2.97 also marks a 4% gain in a week and a 5% gain in a month. What’s bullish about XRP right now is that it has been in a fairly oversold position for too long now, and should really rebound strongly, especially given its fundamentals. As we see with its chart below, its relative strength index (yellow) has been seesawing around the 50 level since late July. Source: TradingView Its price has also been trading within a pennant, which appears to be converging towards a point where XRP should make a big move. And given that more than ten XRP ETFs are likely to launch in the next few weeks, this big move could be very positive. It could hit $3.50 by the end of the month, before climbing above $10 by the end of the year . Crypto Price Prediction: Solana ($SOL) – Altcoin Ready for New ATHs as ETFs Prepare to Launch Solana has dropped by 1% in the past 24 hours, yet its current price of $230 puts it up by 10% in a week and by 13% in a month. And SOL is in a great position to post more gains on top of these, especially when it’s also looking forward to the launch of several Solana ETFs. Bloomberg analysts have given these ETFs a ‘100%’ chance of approval , largely because the SEC has updated its policy on how to process crypto ETF applications. The coin’s chart also suggests that it’s close to exploding, with its two main indicators – the RSI and MACD (orange, blue) – rising up from oversold positions. Source: TradingView In view of these factors, and in view of Solana’s dominant position as a layer-one network , the crypto price prediction for SOL is very good. It could reach $300 at some point in November, before ending 2025 close to $500. Crypto Price Prediction: Shiba Inu ($SHIB) – Meme Token Poised to Outperform Market This Winter At $0.00001267, SHIB has risen by 8% in a week and by 2% in a month, whereas it remains down by 31% in the past year. This is a disappointing percentage, but it suggests that SHIB could rise quickly as and when a market-wide end-of-year rally gets into full swing. Indeed, SHIB is down by 85% in relation to its 2021 ATH of $0.00008616, meaning that it has plenty of catching up to do. Its chart shows that it has begun to recover from an undervalued position, with its RSI and MACD both rising again after being in negative territory. Source: TradingView This suggests that SHIB’s low price is beginning to entice buyers again, although its volume remains modest at $220 million today. Its price is likely to rise in parallel with the market, with an end-of-year bull rally helping to push it back towards $0.000030 in November, and then towards $0.000050 by January. $1.7 Million Raised in Presale: Is PEPENODE Going to Be the Big New Meme Coin of 2026? The coins above have good prospects in the short- and long-term, yet many investors would also do well to consider diversifying their portfolios into small-cap tokens as well. Such tokens can post disproportionate, exponential gains, seeing as how they start from low levels and can rise quickly once they gain new listings. One token hoping to do this soon is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), a new ERC-20 cryptocurrency that recently launched its presale. Building a Server Room AND Virtual Mining?! Yes Please. Let the $PEPENODE flow https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/jN00FsQ3UQ — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 7, 2025 It has now raised $1.7 million in its sale, which is attracting more investors with each passing week. PEPENODE has been intriguing investors because of its claim to be the market’s first mine-to-earn token. What this means is that users will have the ability to earn rewards by building their own virtual mining rigs. They can add virtual nodes to their rigs by buying them with PEPENODE, something which could drive demand for the new token. And the more nodes a user has, the more they’ll earn in rewards, which PEPENODE will pay out in third-party tokens, such as Fartcoin and Pepe. Holders will also be able to stake PEPENODE, making it a potentially very lucrative token. Its sale will end a little later in the year, but investors can join now by heading over to the PEPENODE website . It’s currently selling for $0.0010918, a price that will continue to rise until the sale closes. Buy PEPENODE Here.

With Bitcoin holding steady and DeFi projects reviving momentum, investors are hunting for the next breakout. If you’re asking: “Which token could let me turn $500 into $50,000 this quarter?”. You’ll want to balance safety, growth potential, and smash-through narratives. In that case, a new DeFi project is attracting whale attention due to its real-world utility. Cardano Price: Can ADA Still Be the Play? Cardano remains a key player among layer-1 projects. The Cardano price prediction reports are split. Some see ADA revisiting $1.50, while others warn of possible dips. ADA is stuck below key resistance near $0.85, with analysts saying a breakout could send it toward $1.50. But others caution that if it fails, it may slip toward $0.70. In recent forecasts, Cardano is projected to average around $0.95. Early buyers of ADA in past cycles are already up big but scaling a $500 position into $50,000 in one quarter using ADA alone demands a 100× move. That’s unlikely for a large, fairly liquid token like ADA unless there’s a shock catalyst. Still, ADA’s stability and adoption make it a contender if markets tip toward risk assets again. Remittix (RTX): The Breakout Bet You Can’t Ignore Remittix is emerging not just as “another altcoin,” but as a real use-case powerhouse with momentum that’s hard to ignore. It is positioning itself as a cross-chain PayFi platform built to bridge crypto and fiat flows. If Cardano gives you stability, Remittix gives you explosive upside. Remittix isn’t just hype , it’s backing that up with utility, momentum, and verified credentials. If current trajectories hold, early RTX buyers could see returns that dwarf what ADA or XRP might deliver this quarter. Why Remittix Might Outpace the Pack ● Global Reach to Banks: Users can send crypto to traditional bank accounts in 30+ countries directly.● Real-World Utility: Not just speculation; built for payments, borderless flows, and everyday use.● Security First: Fully audited and CertiK-verified, ranked #1 among prelaunch tokens.● Wallet Launch & FX Power: The mobile wallet is on track, with real-time FX conversion built in.● Impressive Fundraising: Over $27.1 million raised, and already 675 million+ RTX sold in the presale. Compared with ADA or even mature altcoins, Remittix offers a leap: a smaller token with room to burst, a community that’s growing fast, and a roadmap tied to real payments. Early holders may reap outsized gains if the platform captures adoption. Remittix $250,000 Giveaway & Referral Blitz Remittix just kicked off a $250,000 giveaway to reward early supporters. But that’s not all — they launched a new referral program that lets every user earn 15% of any new buyer’s purchase in USDT, claimable every 24 hours through their dashboard. What does that mean for you? Your investment doesn’t just sit — it works. You refer your network, you earn. This could turn referrals into a serious side income in days. The presale has already soared past $27.1 million raised, and 675 million RTX tokens sold so far. Over 25,000 holders have joined, and the Gleam page for the giveaway is flooded with 300,000+ entries. Exchanges like BitMart and LBank are first up in confirming listing plans — momentum is building fast.

These metrics, alongside a recovering NVT Golden Cross and positive funding rates, indicate measured, institution-led demand driving upside momentum. Institutions continue to accumulate on spot markets, shown by a sustained Coinbase Premium. Spot Taker CVD and Funding Rates point to buyer dominance and controlled optimism among leveraged traders. NVT Golden Cross recovery (+38%) signals valuation aligning with rising on‑chain activity. Bitcoin institutional inflows lead market strength — read the latest data-driven analysis and what investors should watch next. What are the latest signs that institutional inflows are driving Bitcoin? Bitcoin institutional inflows are evident from a persistently positive Coinbase Premium Index and taker-buy dominance in spot markets. These indicators show sustained accumulation by professional investors, supporting a bullish structure where spot demand underpins price action rather than short-lived leverage-driven rallies. How does the Coinbase Premium Index confirm accumulation? The Coinbase Premium Index staying positive means more buying pressure on Coinbase Pro versus other venues. This pattern typically reflects larger, U.S.-based institutional orders and suggests that deep-pocketed participants are steadily building positions during consolidation phases. How are buyers controlling market momentum? The 90-day Spot Taker CVD has been taker-buy dominant, indicating aggressive buys that lift offers and absorb sell-side liquidity. This behavior demonstrates persistent demand absorption and confidence in price continuation. Spot-driven accumulation reduces reliance on leveraged speculation and points to a structural buyer base that can sustain rallies with lower volatility risk. Source: CryptoQuant (plain text) What does the NVT Golden Cross recovery mean for Bitcoin’s fundamentals? The NVT Golden Cross recovering ~38% shows improving alignment between Bitcoin’s market cap and transaction activity. A rising NVT Golden Cross implies that price moves are increasingly supported by on‑chain usage rather than speculative flows. This trend historically correlates with higher-quality appreciation and suggests a shift toward sustainable growth momentum. Source: CryptoQuant (plain text) Why do positive funding rates matter now? Moderately positive Funding Rates (averaging ~0.01% on major venues) show that longs slightly dominate derivatives positioning. This level of positivity indicates confidence among leveraged traders without excessive crowding, which reduces tail-risk from forced deleveraging events. Combined with spot accumulation, positive funding suggests the market is structurally constructive rather than overheated. Source: Santiment (plain text) Are institutions setting the tone for Bitcoin’s next rally? The alignment of institutional accumulation, taker-buy dominance in spot, a recovering NVT Golden Cross, and balanced positive funding rates forms a coherent bullish narrative. These signals together increase the probability that any next leg up will be supported by active demand rather than speculative excess. Institutional conviction appears to be the stabilizing factor that could attract incremental retail participation over time. Frequently Asked Questions How can investors track institutional accumulation? Investors can monitor the Coinbase Premium Index, Spot Taker CVD, and on‑chain NVT metrics. Consistently positive premium and taker-buy dominance indicate ongoing institutional accumulation and stronger market structure. Does a positive funding rate always mean a rally is imminent? No. A modestly positive funding rate shows long-side preference but must be interpreted with spot and on‑chain data; when combined with spot accumulation and improved NVT, it adds conviction for sustained upside. What should traders watch next? Watch changes in Coinbase Premium, Spot Taker CVD momentum, NVT trajectory, and funding-rate spikes. Divergences between these indicators and price action can signal shifts in market risk or reduced institutional demand. Key Takeaways Institutional accumulation is persistent : Coinbase Premium and taker-buy CVD show steady buying by professional investors. Fundamentals are improving : A ~38% NVT Golden Cross recovery points to valuation aligning with on‑chain activity. Balanced bullishness : Positive but modest funding rates suggest controlled leverage and lower blow-off risk; monitor these metrics for continued alignment. Conclusion Data-driven indicators — including the Coinbase Premium Index , 90-day Spot Taker CVD, NVT Golden Cross recovery, and steady funding rates — collectively point to institution-led strength in Bitcoin. Continued alignment of spot accumulation and on‑chain fundamentals would support a sustainable upward trajectory; investors should monitor these signals for confirmation. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-institutional-inflows-analysis-2025-10-07"" }, ""headline"": ""Institutional Inflows and Buyer Dominance Support Bitcoin’s Bullish Structure"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bitcoin-Spot-Taker-CVDCumulative-Volume-Delta-90-day-7.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-07T10:23:35Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T10:23:35Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Institutional inflows tracked by Coinbase Premium and spot taker CVD support Bitcoin’s bullish structure; NVT recovery and positive funding rates add conviction.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How do institutional inflows show up in market data?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Institutional inflows appear as a sustained positive Coinbase Premium, taker-buy dominant Spot CVD, and steady accumulation on large spot venues, indicating professional demand."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What does a recovering NVT Golden Cross indicate?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A recovering NVT Golden Cross suggests valuation is aligning with rising on-chain transaction activity, implying more fundamental support for price moves."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Bitcoin market signals for institutional accumulation"", ""description"": ""A short guide to reading Coinbase Premium, Spot Taker CVD, NVT Golden Cross, and funding rates to assess institutional demand."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Check Coinbase Premium"", ""text"": ""Confirm whether the Coinbase Premium Index is persistently positive to detect U.S. spot accumulation."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Review Spot Taker CVD"", ""text"": ""Assess the 90-day Spot Taker CVD for taker-buy dominance, which signals aggressive buying and liquidity absorption."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Analyze NVT and Funding"", ""text"": ""Combine NVT Golden Cross trends with Funding Rates to judge whether price moves are fundamental or leverage-driven."" } ]} Published: 2025-10-07 | Updated: 2025-10-07 | Author: COINOTAG",Bitcoin|News|BTC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-07 23:11:41

Grayscale launches staking for its Ethereum ETFs with 32,000 ETH staked as ETH price climbs above $4,700. What is Grayscale staking for its Ethereum ETFs? Grayscale staking for its Ethereum ETFs is a program that enabled Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH funds to stake pooled ETH on the Ethereum proof-of-stake network, earning protocol staking rewards. Both funds staked a combined 32,000 ETH (~$150 million) on launch day, aiming to enhance fund returns for investors. How does Grayscale distribute staking rewards for ETHE and ETH? Grayscale uses a dual reward strategy. ETHE will pay staking rewards as periodic cash distributions to shareholders. ETH will retain staking rewards within the fund, increasing net asset value over time. Arkham Intelligence provided the initial staking tally of 32,000 ETH as the on-chain reference.

Staking can increase ETF performance by adding protocol rewards to returns. ETHE distributes rewards as cash, which benefits income-focused investors, while ETH compounds returns by reinvesting rewards into NAV. Is staking secure for institutional investors? Security depends on custody arrangements and validator selection. Institutional-grade custody and transparent validator processes reduce operational risk.

The Russian media outlet RBC reported that the facility operators used power grid know-how to manipulate meter data. Russian law enforcement officers break into a container housing hundreds of crypto mining rigs during a raid. (Source: Ministry of Interior/Telegram) 2,700 Crypto Mining Rigs Confiscated Irina Volk, a spokesperson for the Russian Interior Ministry, explained that “over seven years ago,” three unnamed St. Petersburg residents “signed a contract to connect a commercial property to the power grid.” However, earlier this year, energy grid investigators began to suspect something was amiss with the property’s power consumption. They followed up with a probe, which revealed a discrepancy between meter readings at the facility and actual usage figures. The Interior Ministry and police joined the investigation, eventually raiding the facility. Volk released a video on the ministry’s Telegram channel, showing officers conducting the raid. The video shows officers forcing a man to the floor inside a building. Other officers then force open a locked shipping container with a crowbar. Inside, the container appears to be housing thousands of operational crypto mining rigs. Officers said they found several of these containers at the site. Fans and other cooling equipment also appear to be functioning inside the container. Officers then force open the door to another building, which also houses banks of hundreds of rigs. Russian law enforcement officers find thousands of crypto mining rigs during a raid. (Source: Ministry of Interior/Telegram) Officers Confiscate Transformers and Cooling Equipment Volk said ministry officials believe that the suspects used advanced electrical knowledge to manipulate the meter. The meter then provided low readings to the power provider, allowing the suspects to pay for a tiny fraction of the power they had consumed. The crypto mining “farm” operated unhindered between March 2018 and August 2025, the spokesperson confirmed. Officers said they confiscated all of the mining rigs, in addition to two transformers and cooling equipment.

The ministry did not reveal how much electricity they believe the suspects had stolen from the grid, nor its monetary worth or the type of coins the trio mined. However, illegal crypto mining appears to be on the rise in Russia and Russia-controlled territories. In mid-September, Russian police unearthed a small network of illegal mining centers in what Moscow calls the Donetsk People’s Republic.

The network’s operators caused damages worth 14 million rubles ($170,633), officials said. Illegal crypto mining is particularly rife in traditional Russian Bitcoin mining hotspots like the North Caucasus and Southern Siberia. Last year, power providers in Dagestan announced they had discovered subterranean crypto mining centers, apparently built to avoid detection from energy officials . Some illegal miners have also begun using mobile units housed in large trucks and vans to help them relocate if they learn that energy companies have become aware of their activities.

According to Karoline, the president plan to redirect millions of dollars collected through tariffs to temporarily fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, better known as WIC, before it collapses from a lack of federal money. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that “the Trump White House will not allow impoverished mothers and their babies to go hungry because of the Democrats’ political games.” WIC, which helps families buy formula, fruits, vegetables, baby food, yogurt, bread, cheese, and more, was expected to run out of money this week. In past shutdowns, the program leaned on emergency reserves to stay afloat, but this time around, things are far more fragile. Some states had already started planning to use their own funds to cover the program temporarily, with the hope of getting reimbursed later once Congress gets its act together. States face delays as White House rushes to plug the gap Now WIC supports around 7 million people across the country, though only half of those who qualify are actually enrolled. And while the program has enjoyed strong bipartisan support since it was created, cracks have started to show. The White House’s 2026 budget plan includes cuts to the popular fruit and vegetable benefits, and House Republicans’ agriculture bill has floated similar reductions. Even as Trump moves to hold the line with tariff cash, Georgia Machell, who heads the National WIC Association, said the situation is full of holes. “Families need long-term stability, not short-term uncertainty. We still don’t know how much funding this measure provides, how quickly states will receive it, or how long it will sustain operations,” Georgia said in a public statement on Tuesday. Some states were already preparing for the worst before the Trump announcement. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had informed them last week that they wouldn’t receive their regular quarterly allocation of WIC funds for fiscal year 2026. In the meantime, the USDA said it could release up to $150 million in contingency funds to states with critical shortfalls, and told states to also use infant formula rebates or local dollars to fill any gaps. Critics question legality of tariff plan But not everyone is sold on the legality of Trump’s plans. Chris Towner, a budget policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told CNN that:- “The problem isn’t that they don’t have the money, it’s that Congress hasn’t told them they can spend it.” That comment raises bigger questions about whether the administration can keep WIC running on tariff funds alone without breaking spending laws. Meanwhile, more families are joining WIC every year as states and the federal government have made it easier to enroll and recertify, and improved the overall shopping experience. On top of that, inflation, especially around food prices, has been crushing low-income households. Surging costs of groceries and other essentials have pushed more American families to depend on government aid like WIC just to survive, but that .

Although known for his support of Ethereum, Leshka has recently turned his analytical focus toward XRP, presenting an unexpected yet confident prediction about its short-term potential. According to Leshka, XRP could rise to as high as $8.5 before the end of Q4 2025. His assessment arrives at a time when XRP continues to lag behind other leading digital assets, struggling to sustain momentum despite a modest recovery across the broader crypto market. XRP’s Current Market Position At the time of analysis, XRP is trading around $2.89 , reflecting a modest 1.9% increase over the past week. However, data shows that XRP remains one of the weakest performers among the top ten cryptocurrencies. In comparison, Bitcoin (BTC) has climbed 7.69% in the same period, while Ethereum (ETH) has seen an even stronger 10% rise. The underwhelming performance of XRP is largely attributed to selling pressure near the $3 psychological resistance level, which has repeatedly limited its upward movement. Despite this, Leshka maintains a positive outlook, asserting that XRP has the potential to deliver outsized gains by year-end. $XRP just broke out of 6-month triangle exactly like 2017 same pattern, same RSI sequence, same setup 2017 gave us 20x to $3.33 2025 targeting $8.50 by EOY the fractal is identical history doesn't repeat but it rhymes $XRP army is about to leave the cuck chair and join the… https://t.co/lsod6KZ2P5 pic.twitter.com/1JVcXJdkt5 — Leshka.eth (@leshka_eth) July 27, 2025 Leshka’s Q4 2025 Forecast for XRP The analyst predicts that XRP will trade within a range of $8 to $9 in the fourth quarter of 2025. From current levels, this target represents an increase of approximately 176% to 211%. His projection is based on technical analysis that compares XRP’s present price action to historical patterns observed in previous market cycles. Leshka previously highlighted that XRP had completed a breakout from a six-month consolidation structure similar to the one preceding its 2017 bull run . During that period, XRP surged twentyfold, peaking at around $3.30. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Drawing parallels between the two market conditions, he believes XRP is following a comparable trajectory, only this time, with a higher potential ceiling. Based on these similarities, Leshka anticipates that XRP could approach $8.5 by the end of 2025, which closely aligns with his latest $8–$9 estimate. Comparative Forecasts for Bitcoin and Ethereum Beyond XRP, Leshka has also provided projections for other major cryptocurrencies. He expects Bitcoin to trade between $225,000 and $240,000 by the close of 2025. From its current price of $122,177, this range implies potential growth of 84% to 96%. For Ethereum, Leshka anticipates a price range of $11,000 to $13,000, up from its current level of $4,506. This projection translates to a potential gain 144% to 189%, indicating that the analyst maintains strong confidence in Ethereum’s performance. However, his forecast also suggests that XRP could outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum in percentage growth terms within the same period. Leshka’s projections reflect a bullish stance on XRP despite its current struggles with market resistance and underperformance relative to peers. His analysis, rooted in historical price structures and technical patterns, envisions substantial upward potential by the end of 2025. If the forecast materializes, XRP could not only recover from its present stagnation but also become one of the strongest performers among major digital assets in the coming months.

The meme coin has outperformed XRP over the past week, gaining 12% and surpassing $4 billion in 24-hour trading volume. Yet, both altcoins find themselves similarly positioned, with several issuers facing their final spot ETF decision deadline on October 17. XRP and Dogecoin ETF decision deadlines. As qualifying assets under the SEC generic listing standards, they land on the fast track for approval, making S-1 filings the last barrier for a green light. But with markets anticipating another 50 bps in U.S. interest rate cuts before year-end, the macro backdrop continues to drive capital rotation into higher-risk assets like meme coins. Dogecoin Price Analysis: This Could be the Start of $1 DOGE These stacking catalysts for demand position DOGE to realise a cup-and-handle pattern forming since the start of the year. Dogecoin now approaches the neckline at $0.29, the key threshold for a breakout, with momentum indicators firmly bullish. DOGE / USD 1-day chart, 10-month cup-and-handle pattern nears breakout. Source: TradingView. The RSI has established a strong footing above the neutral line, suggesting buyers are maintaining control of the current move. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram continues to widen its gap above the signal line, reinforcing the view that the uptrend has staying power. A successful flip of the neckline to support would confirm the breakout, eyeing a retest of all-time highs at $0.49 and a potential 150% move $0.65. And as the bull market matures, continued rate cuts and deeper TradFi exposure via ETFs, corporate treasuries, and even potential 401(k) inclusion could drive DOGE further. The $1 milestone could be in focus , making for a 285% gain.

That surge came right after the company locked in a major deal with OpenAI, the same day Jefferies slapped a massive upgrade on the stock. The brokerage firm hiked AMD’s price target from $170 to $300, a bold 82% increase, and moved the rating from “hold” to “buy.” That $300 call represents almost a 50% jump from where AMD closed on Monday, which was $203.71. The Jefferies call wasn’t just some surface-level optimism. Analysts there laid out an even bigger upside case, $400 per share, if the AI server market goes even faster and AMD eats more of Nvidia’s lunch. If that scenario plays out, AMD shares would nearly double from where they’re sitting now. The stock’s Monday surge alone dragged the Nasdaq Composite to a new all-time high. AMD soared, and in a twist, Nvidia dropped. That role reversal didn’t go unnoticed on the street. OpenAI takes 10% stake as AMD commits massive GPU power The big trigger behind this price explosion is AMD’s newly announced deal with OpenAI. The company behind ChatGPT is giving AMD a vote of confidence, and up to a 10% stake, in exchange for years’ worth of GPU rollout. The plan is to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs over several years, which is a serious buildout (measured in gigawatts, not just chips), proving just how massive the AI infrastructure race has become. Blayne Curtis, analyst at Jefferies, called it a “multi-generational opportunity” in a note to clients Monday night. He admitted the upgrade wasn’t even on the table before the announcement, but the deal “forced his hand.” His note said, “AMD will still have to hit milestones, but this is a strong validation of AMD’s AI roadmap and the level of AI demand in general.” Blayne added that OpenAI has already been “on a spending spree,” cutting non-binding deals with Nvidia, Oracle, and Samsung/Hynix, all pointing to a massive land grab for compute capacity and energy-hungry data centers. The agreement isn’t signed in blood, but the size and ambition show that OpenAI sees this as a long-haul investment in compute. And if the numbers hold up, AMD may find itself stealing even more share from Nvidia, especially as AI players look to diversify supplier exposure amid surging demand. Investors split on AI profits while bubble fears grow On CNBC’s “Halftime Report” Tuesday, Josh Brown from Ritholtz Wealth Management said he’s not blind to the bubble, but said people need to get over the idea that everything is hype. “Of course, there’s a bubble,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean there aren’t real projects that are going to have world-transforming outcomes.” He warned against throwing all AI bets into the “speculative” bucket, saying investors should still take some of them seriously. At the same time, Brown didn’t deny things are getting frothy. “Anytime you have an environment where there’s this much enthusiasm for a new technology, and there are literally trillions of dollars being spent, not all of that spending is going to have a nice ROI at the end of the rainbow,” he said. Tuesday’s broader market action reflected some of that tension. The Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.7%, even though it had just touched a fresh high the day before. Oracle led a wave of pullbacks in other AI-related names, like Nvidia, Western Digital, and SanDisk. That move came after The Information reported that Oracle’s cloud business saw slimmer-than-expected profit margins on Nvidia sales for the quarter ending in August. That triggered fresh fears that while AI stocks might look unstoppable on the surface, revenue might not keep up. Brown added that when this bubble finally gives, it might just be a fizzle, not a crash. “Most of the time, you’ll just see certain names blow up, you’ll see valuations contract [and] you’ll see a couple of years of sluggish share price growth as we digest some of the excess,” he said. “It doesn’t always have to be the Nasdaq down 85%.” And with OpenAI onboard and analysts gunning for $300 to $400 targets, traders aren’t easing off the gas.

The plan was revealed during a Futures and Derivatives Law Report event hosted by the law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP in New York. SEC pushes ahead with crypto exemption despite government shutdown The SEC Chair explained that many people who build with digital assets relocate their work to other countries due to unclear or stringent regulations by the SEC. He wants to give people a fair chance to work on new technologies without worrying that the SEC will suddenly take action against them. Atkins said that the SEC expects to propose the official rulemaking process for the innovation exemption no later than the end of 2025 or early 2026, depending on how long this government shutdown is going to have to go.” The agency can still perform some crucial jobs, but the shutdown has halted rulemaking and made it difficult to adhere to planned schedules. He also discussed how the SEC drove many talented developers, engineers, and business leaders out of the United States in search of better opportunities, largely due to strict and unclear rules that instilled fear. “We’ve had four years of repression in that industry, and it pushed innovation abroad rather than keeping it here,” he said. “My goal now is to make people feel they can build in the United States without fearing unclear regulations.” Atkins added that the new exemption rule won’t remove oversight or allow unsafe practices. Instead, it will balance between safety and progress to open doors for entrepreneurs and developers who want to build responsibly but need clear rules to do so. Lawmakers push for new crypto bills in Congress The SEC Chair commended Congress for its efforts in shaping policies that support innovation and referred to the GENIUS Act as a big first step toward building a full national framework for digital assets. He said that the GENIUS Act helps create a more predictable and secure environment for developers, investors, and businesses who have long requested clear rules. He added that the coordination between the SEC and Congress will make it easier for new companies to understand the rules that apply to them and how they can comply. It will also prevent any confusion and overlapping rules that have previously made it difficult for startups to operate. Summer Mersinger, CEO of the Blockchain Association and a former commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), also shared her views on the progress of crypto legislation in Congress. She said that there is a 50% chance that Congress will be able to pass a broader “market structure” bill before the end of 2025, as it still faces numerous political and regulatory challenges. Other speakers, including Greg Xethalis, a lawyer and general counsel at Multicoin Capital, and Chris Perkins, president of CoinFund, noted that progress is still being made, even if it is slow. Xethalis stated that developers are preparing to utilize stablecoins in everyday financial applications, citing Visa’s integration of USDC as an example. Perkins said that the new rules from the GENIUS Act and the stablecoin proposals by the Treasury Department make developers more confident in building in the United States without fear. Mersinger added that stablecoins will also be useful in larger financial processes, such as fund transfers, collateral management, and settlement in complex contracts.

Institutional inflows via Bitcoin ETFs have created durable demand for crypto markets. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold more than $169 billion, roughly 6.8% of Bitcoin’s market value (SoSoValue). Custody solutions and wealth manager adoption are enabling large-scale, long-term allocations. Institutional crypto inflows are stabilizing markets and driving BTC gains; learn how ETFs and wealth managers are reshaping allocation strategies — read more from COINOTAG. What are institutional crypto inflows and why do they matter? Institutional crypto inflows refer to capital moving into crypto assets from institutions such as wealth managers, family offices, and ETF vehicles. These inflows matter because they provide steady, long-term demand that can reduce volatility and support price discovery. How are Bitcoin ETFs changing market dynamics? Spot Bitcoin ETFs have shifted the investor mix from retail traders to professional allocators. The first year of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw about $30 billion in inflows, followed by roughly $20 billion this year, with quarterly inflows of $5–$10 billion. These flows now represent over $169 billion in ETF-held Bitcoin, according to SoSoValue, helping to smooth trading and encourage institutional participation. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/crypto/institutional-inflows-bitcoin-etfs"" }, ""headline"": ""Institutional Capital Drives Crypto: ETFs and Wealth Managers Bring Stability"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/coinotag-logo.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Institutional crypto inflows via Bitcoin ETFs and wealth managers are providing steady demand, reducing volatility, and contributing to Bitcoin's recent record highs.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are institutional inflows reducing crypto volatility?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Family offices and high-net-worth clients view crypto as a long-term allocation and inflation hedge. Elliot Andrews, CEO of Aspen Digital, said clients seek consistent, risk-adjusted performance rather than speculative 100x bets, so crypto is becoming a small but meaningful part of diversified portfolios. What infrastructure improvements enabled this shift? Custody has largely been solved for institutions, with providers such as Coinbase, Anchorage, and Fidelity offering secure custody. Regulatory clarifications—like recognizing state-chartered trusts as custodians—have further lowered barriers for institutional participation. Frequently Asked Questions How do ETFs change liquidity in the Bitcoin market? ETFs concentrate demand into regulated accounts and create predictable inflows, improving liquidity and dampening abrupt price swings caused by retail trading patterns. Can institutional inflows cause higher prices long term? Yes. Sustained institutional buying increases demand relative to supply, which can support higher price discovery over extended periods without guaranteeing short-term gains. Key Takeaways Institutional inflows: are shifting crypto from retail-driven cycles to steady, professional demand. Bitcoin ETFs: have collected substantial assets—about $50 billion across two measured periods—helping stabilize markets. Operational readiness: custody solutions and regulatory clarity now allow wealth managers to allocate with confidence. Conclusion Institutional crypto inflows, driven by spot Bitcoin ETFs and wealth managers, are reshaping market structure by adding durable demand and reducing speculative volatility. COINOTAG reports that custody maturity and regulatory steps have made crypto a viable long-term allocation for institutions, signaling a more stable phase for the market and continued professional participation.",News|BTC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-07 23:58:37

The leading cryptocurrency traded around $125,800–$126,200 on October 7, 2025. The surge reinforces Bitcoin’s status as a global macro asset on the backs of all-time high ETF inflows, institutional accumulation and a sweeping sentiment shift. Simultaneously, early-stage investors eye MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rapidly growing project labelled one of the most promising altcoins for 2025. Having raised over $15.5 million, and analysts expecting a 50x upside, the project is becoming a major topic of discussion among retail and institutional investors alike. ETF Inflows and Macroeconomic Drivers Power Bitcoin’s Record Run Bitcoin’s new uptrend fits a seasonal pattern called “Uptober,” which usually produces big gains for cryptocurrencies in the past years. The combined effect of the favorable macro environment, steeper institutional inflows, and on-chain supply constraints has propelled the momentum this year. Evidence of inflows into spot Bitcoin funds of over $1.6 billion was reported last week. Funds led by BlackRock IBIT and Fidelity FBTC have gained global exposure without custody. Bitcoin is also seeing its exchange reserves drop to a six-year low, with close to 170,000 BTC (over $21 billion) withdrawn into cold wallets in the last month – a clear sign of confidence from the long-term holders. Macro trends also favor continued upside. A weaker US dollar, forecasts for interest rate cuts and concern about the sustainability of government debt have bolstered Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against Monetray Risk. We are witnessing the trend of institutional adoption moving beyond financial firms, with sovereign wealth funds reportedly buying up BTC. Analyst Targets: $130K to $135K in Sight Bitcoin looks set for a move towards the next resistance zone of $130,000-$135,000. According to some technical models — including Fibonacci extensions and historical breakout cycles — there is room for price discovery if momentum carries me higher. Traders who trade for short periods of time are waiting to see if key supports between $115,000 and $120,000 result in profitable pullbacks. Moreover, derivative markets have seen rising open interest without funding spikes. In other words, this is not a sign of leverage speculation. Instead, it is a strength that looks more spot led than leverage. If the pace of inflows into ETFs continues, we can expect Bitcoin to move towards $150,000 before the end of this year. This is due to liquidity rotating from traditional assets into the crypto realm via regulated exposure. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 50x Presale Prospect While Bitcoin has been in the news frequently, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become the focus of discussion. Across large trading desks and retail communities, analysts are identifying it as one of the only credible projects that could do 50x going into the next bull cycle. Strong comparisons are being drawn between the project’s early-stage fundamentals and the pre-listing tokens. Because of its emphasis on verifiable, compliant fundraising and its scarcity-driven model, it has gained traction among serious investors. Experts refer to it as a hidden treasure — one that strikes a balance between meme narrative zeal and disciplined tokenomics. As capital flows out of high-cap assets like Bitcoin, this could support investor rotation into undervalued presales, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Market commentators suggest that it’s the top early-stage opportunity of 2025, akin to Solana and Avalanche at the beginning of their own rise in previous cycles. Outlook: Two Sides of the Same Market Story Bitcoin’s latest record-breaking move above $126,000 demonstrates how much the asset has matured from a speculative investment to a macroeconomic asset class. Analysts say that ongoing uptake of ETFs and favourable macroeconomic conditions might see further upside until end-Q4 2025. On the other hand, MAGACOIN FINANCE symbolises the other end of the market spectrum, namely, the high upside innovation frontier, capturing the retail FOMO and further exponential growth potential that still defines the DNA of crypto. Its characteristics of being hard-capped, verifiably secured, and rapidly community-driven give an appealing proposition for 2025. The combination of institutional maturity and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage momentum represent both strength and opportunity within the new cycle of Bitcoin.

If ADA breaches $0.96 with rising volume, targets range from $1.28 up to approximately $1.90 on measured moves. What Is Happening with Cardano’s Price? Cardano price has been compressing into a symmetrical triangle since late 2024, closing the range near $0.857. The pattern’s converging trendlines imply reduced volatility and a higher-probability breakout as the price approaches the apex. Market participants are watching for a breakout accompanied by expanding volume. Source: Ali Charts Via X How Are Fibonacci Levels Influencing ADA? ADA has repeatedly reacted to key Fibonacci retracement zones at $0.76, $0.96 and $1.87. These levels act as technical reference points where price often stalls or reverses. Historically, bounces and rejections at these levels have influenced short-term structure and trader positioning. Why Does Volume Matter for the Next Move? Volume confirms conviction. On October 4, ADA briefly dipped to roughly $0.83 before buyers pushed the price above $0.87 on October 5. That uptick came with steady volume, indicating broad participation rather than a single large trade. A true breakout will likely require volume expansion to validate follow-through. Source: CoinGecko What Could Happen Next? If ADA holds near $0.75–$0.76 support and breaks above $0.96, the measured move from the triangle projects initial targets at $1.28 and extended resistance near $1.87–$1.90. Conversely, a decisive breakdown below $0.75 risks further downside and a retest of lower support bands. Cardano remains a widely traded Layer 1 blockchain known for low fees and active development. With a market capitalization above $30 billion and daily volumes often exceeding $1 billion, ADA retains strong liquidity, which matters when large directional moves occur. How Should Traders Monitor the Breakout? Watch for a daily close above $0.96 with increasing volume for bullish confirmation. Use $0.75–$0.76 as the key invalidation zone for this bullish scenario. Scale risk using position sizing and stop-losses below support to manage downside exposure.

Fibonacci retracements at $0.76, $0.96, and $1.87 are significant. Traders often use these zones for entries, stop placement, and profit targets because ADA has historically reacted at these levels. How should I manage risk around the triangle breakout? Use a stop-loss beneath $0.75 to limit losses. Adopt position sizing that keeps downside risk acceptable. Consider scaling into positions after confirmation of a breakout with higher-than-average volume. Key Takeaways Consolidation: ADA trades near $0.86 inside a symmetrical triangle, signaling a likely imminent move. Breakout level: A clear daily close above $0.96 with rising volume would validate bullish targets to $1.90. Risk management: A breakdown below $0.75 negates the bullish thesis; use stops and position sizing to manage risk. Conclusion This analysis shows Cardano price consolidating at $0.86 within a symmetrical triangle. Monitoring $0.96 for a breakout and $0.75 as the key invalidation level provides a clear framework.

The broader macro backdrop adds complexity to this moment—gold continues to rise, signaling mounting stress across traditional financial systems and renewed interest in hard assets. Historically, such moves in gold have preceded similar reactions in Bitcoin, often serving as a leading indicator of capital rotation into digital stores of value. Amid this setup, on-chain data from CryptoQuant reveals an important dynamic among short-term participants. The Short-Term Holder Unrealized Profit metric has started to rise, showing that recent buyers are sitting on growing paper gains. This behavior often serves as an early signal of market tension—either preceding a wave of profit-taking or marking the beginning of an accelerated bullish phase. Analysts are divided: some see parallels with previous pre-breakout periods when BTC consolidated before massive upside expansions, while others warn that excessive unrealized profits could trigger a short-term correction. In either case, the data points to an increasingly active market structure, where both macro catalysts and onchain sentiment align for what could be Bitcoin’s most decisive moment since its last all-time high. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Signal $131K Target Analyst Axel Adler shared onchain insights suggesting that Bitcoin may be on the verge of another major move. According to Adler, Short-Term Holders’ (STH) unrealized profit has now risen to 10%, reflecting growing optimism among recent market participants. This level of profitability has historically coincided with heightened volatility, as traders begin to decide between locking in gains or riding the trend higher. Adler highlighted that earlier this year, when unrealized profits reached 15%, the market experienced a wave of selling pressure — triggering a temporary correction before resuming the uptrend. Adler’s analysis places the next critical threshold around $131.8K per BTC, where short-term holders may again be incentivized to take profits. However, this level also marks a potential acceleration point if demand from institutions and ETFs continues to absorb supply efficiently. The market’s structure suggests that BTC could be preparing for a large breakout after weeks of consolidation near the $125K region. While caution remains warranted due to elevated unrealized gains, the broader macro backdrop — including rising gold prices and liquidity rotation into risk assets — supports the view that Bitcoin’s bullish cycle remains intact. Many analysts expect a strong push toward new highs in the coming weeks if momentum persists and short-term selling remains limited. Bulls Hold Ground Near All-Time High Bitcoin is currently trading around $124,316, consolidating just below its all-time high near $126,000 after a strong multi-week rally from the $109,000 region. The chart shows BTC holding above key support at $117,500, a level that acted as major resistance throughout August and September. Its successful breakout and subsequent retest confirm a shift in market structure toward a sustained bullish trend. The 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages are now trending upward, reinforcing the positive outlook. Price action shows tightening candles near resistance, a sign of equilibrium between buyers and short-term profit-takers. If BTC manages to close decisively above $125,000, it could trigger an acceleration toward $130,000–$132,000, aligning with the next key Fibonacci extension levels. However, momentum appears to be cooling slightly after an extended run, suggesting a potential short-term consolidation phase before another impulse. As long as the price remains above $120,000, the broader bullish structure remains intact. The ongoing strength in gold and renewed inflows from ETFs provide a supportive macro backdrop, hinting that Bitcoin could soon enter price discovery if bulls maintain control and short-term holders resist the urge to realize profits prematurely.

The analyst believes the digital asset will ultimately prove to be one of the greatest assets of our lifetime, reinforcing his consistent optimism about its value and role in the evolving financial ecosystem. A Conviction Shaped by the 2020 SEC Lawsuit In his latest commentary, Coach JV reflected on the origins of his commitment to XRP, which began during one of the most turbulent periods in its history, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020. At the time, the market reacted sharply, with widespread panic among investors and a steep decline in XRP’s price to around $0.17. Rather than follow the sell-off, Coach JV stated that he chose to increase his holdings, guided by his belief in XRP’s long-term utility and the importance of staying disciplined amid uncertainty. He attributes this decision to a combination of intuition, patience, and adherence to fundamental investment principles. Today, with XRP trading near $3 , the token has appreciated by more than 1,600% since the lawsuit was first announced, an outcome that Coach JV cites as validation of his early confidence in the asset. XRP will be one of the greatest assets of our lifetime. From the moment I was introduced to it, I felt it deep in my gut. I remember December 2020 when the SEC launched their case against Ripple. While the crowd panicked, my instinct said the opposite… go all in. And I did.… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) October 4, 2025 Longstanding Advocacy for XRP Investment Coach JV has consistently encouraged investors to focus on long-term potential rather than short-term market movements. In multiple public statements, he has argued that XRP represents a generational opportunity within the cryptocurrency space. In July 2025, he emphasized that overlooking XRP could become the greatest missed opportunity for investors. He has frequently advised his audience to practice financial discipline, cautioning against prioritizing short-term lifestyle spending over strategic accumulation of digital assets. That same month, he warned that dismissing XRP’s potential could result in missing one of the largest wealth shifts in modern history. His rationale rests on the idea that Ripple’s underlying technology is not merely competing with existing financial systems but aims to modernize and replace outdated infrastructure. By August 2025, Coach JV expanded his predictions further, suggesting that XRP could surpass both Bitcoin and Ethereum by 2030, citing Ripple’s strengthened position following its legal success against the SEC and its growing consumer offerings, including the Gemini XRP Credit Card. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Response and Broader Context Coach JV’s latest remarks have resonated with many XRP holders who share a similar long-term outlook. Community members have expressed optimism about XRP’s future and the potential for significant financial gains over time. One investor, Alex Fifer, mentioned that he continues to accumulate XRP alongside other assets such as XLM and HBAR, viewing them as part of a broader strategy toward early retirement and financial independence. Another community member, Lady Catherine, who has held XRP since 2020, voiced agreement with Coach JV’s forecast but questioned when a major breakout might occur, speculating whether it could take five years or two decades. Additionally, crypto analyst Christopher Greene offered a wider perspective, noting that XRP frequently appears in discussions among major global institutions, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He suggested that this recurring presence underscores XRP’s growing relevance in conversations about the future of cross-border finance. Despite differing opinions within the cryptocurrency community, Coach JV is confident in his belief that XRP’s long-term potential remains undervalued. His consistent message, emphasizing patience, independent analysis, and emotional discipline, continues to attract attention from investors who view XRP as a long-term opportunity rather than a speculative trade.

52818840,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=834007,1759881655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52818840.jpeg,Social Media Turns Bearish On XRP: Is This A Buy Signal?,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/social-media-turns-bearish-on-xrp-buy-signal/,"Data shows users on social media are the most bearish toward XRP in six months, a potential setup for a contrarian move in the asset. XRP Positive/Negative Sentiment Has Plunged Recently According to data from analytics firm Santiment, social media FUD around XRP has seen a spike recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “Positive/Negative Sentiment,” which tells us about how the bullish and bearish sentiments related to the coin compare on the major social media platforms. The metric works by first going through posts/messages/threads on these platforms to separate those that contain mentions of the asset. It then puts them through a machine-learning model to divide between positive and negative comments. Finally, it takes the ratio between the counts of each category to find the net situation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot Volume Rebounds As Price Hits ATH, But Still Far Below Late-2024 Highs Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Positive/Negative Sentiment for XRP over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Positive/Negative Sentiment fell to a low of 0.74 a couple of days back, implying bearish comments were notably outpacing bullish ones. The metric followed up with some recovery, but it lasted only briefly as the latest value has again indicated a dominant negative sentiment, with the ratio standing at 0.86. This latest wave of FUD around the asset on social media is the strongest since six months ago, when Donald Trump’s tariffs shook the market. If history is anything to go by, though, the bearish sentiment among retail traders could actually turn out to be a positive for the cryptocurrency. Digital assets have often tended to move in a way that goes contrary to the expectations of the crowd. This means that when the investors are overly bearish, a bottom can become probable. Given that social media users have been fearful toward XRP for two out of the last three days, it’s possible that a contrarian signal could once again be brewing for it. It now remains to be seen how the asset’s trajectory will look in the coming days, and whether social media sentiment will play a part. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum Lead Record $5.95 Billion Inflows Into Crypto Funds In the scenario that XRP does rebound from here, a technical challenge could be waiting for it, as explained by analyst Ali Martinez in an X post. As is visible in the chart shared by Martinez, XRP has potentially been stuck inside a Parallel Channel on the 4-hour timeframe during the last couple of months. The upper boundary of the channel lies at $3.15, which has proven to be a resistance barrier for the coin in this period. “A breakout here could trigger a rally to $3.60!” says the analyst. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.97, up over 4% in the last seven days.

Bitcoin to $140,000 has an estimated 50% probability for October, according to simulations using daily price data from 2015 onward. The model measures historical volatility and repetitive price rhythms to produce probability ranges, indicating a meaningful chance but not a certainty. How did the simulation calculate the 50% probability? The simulation runs hundreds of scenarios using Bitcoin’s historical daily returns (2015–present). It reproduces observed volatility patterns and draws forward paths to estimate end-of-month price distributions. Economist Timothy Peterson summarized the method as “data-driven” and based on real price behavior rather than sentiment. Inputs included starting price, historical intramonth return distributions, and observed October seasonality. The model output shows a median outcome near current levels and tails that allow for a ~50% probability above $140,000. Why does Bitcoin need ~14.7% to hit $140,000 from current levels? At the reported price of $122,032, Bitcoin requires roughly a 14.7% gain to reach $140,000. This calculation is simple: (140,000 / 122,032) − 1 ≈ 0.147. The figure is front-loaded into simulations to show how plausible that move is within a single month given historical October performance. What historical seasonality supports the projection? October has been historically strong for Bitcoin. Since 2013, October ranks as the second-best month on average, with average gains around 20.75% according to CoinGlass. November historically performs best, averaging roughly 46.02% gains since 2013, which underlines the seasonal strength in late-year months. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is the $140,000 forecast certain?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""No. The 50% probability indicates equal likelihood of finishing above or below $140,000; it is a probabilistic outcome derived from historical simulations, not a guarantee."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What data did the simulation use?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The simulation used Bitcoin daily price data from 2015 onwards, modeled historical volatility patterns and intramonth returns to generate hundreds of potential October outcomes."" } } ]} Prediction described as “not human emotion or biased opinion” — why? Timothy Peterson emphasized that the forecast is based on quantitative simulations rather than trader sentiment. Each projection follows consistent statistical rules that match Bitcoin’s historical volatility and rhythmic price changes. This approach aims to remove short-term emotional bias from the projection. That said, the model cannot capture future macro shocks or regulatory events. Historical fidelity improves probabilistic estimates but does not eliminate unforeseen risks. Since 2013, November has been Bitcoin’s best-performing month, averaging gains of 46.02%. Source: CoinGlass How does market sentiment compare with the model? Market commentary remains broadly bullish after Bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high near $126,200 and later cooled. Analysts such as Jelle and Matthew Hyland (X posts) noted technical retests of highs and growing bullish pressure. These views complement the simulation but are opinion-based rather than probabilistic. CoinMarketCap reporting indicates the recent all-time highs and intraday moves that feed into simulation starting points. Analysts often overlay sentiment and on-chain metrics onto model outputs for a fuller view. Frequently Asked Questions How should traders use a 50% probability forecast? Use it as a probabilistic input to risk management, not a trading signal. A 50% chance reflects mid-range uncertainty; position sizing and stop-loss rules should reflect individual risk tolerance and portfolio objectives. Can seasonality guarantee price moves? No. Seasonality provides a historical tendency. It raises the probability of certain outcomes but cannot guarantee future performance, especially when extraordinary events occur. Key Takeaways Probability-based outlook : Quantitative simulations assign ~50% chance Bitcoin surpasses $140,000 in October. Data inputs : Model uses daily price data since 2015 and historical volatility patterns to create hundreds of scenarios. Actionable insight : Traders should combine probabilistic models with risk controls and consider seasonal trends when sizing positions. Conclusion The Bitcoin to $140,000 projection is a data-driven probability, not a certainty. Historical October seasonality and simulated outcomes support a meaningful chance of a mid-month rally, but investors must weigh model results against macro risks and market dynamics.

Speaking with Cointelegraph at Token2049 in Singapore last week, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said that Solana may gain an edge over Ethereum in the staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, citing its design as more favorable for investors. The company offers a fund called the Bitwise Physical Solana ETP that provides investors with exposure to SOL through a fully backed, physically held structure with institutional-grade custody. Interest in this area has been muted compared to BTC or Ether-based ETFs, with just $30 million in assets under management, according to Bitwise. The firm also has a spot Solana ETF waiting in the SEC approval queue with the final decision due on Oct. 16. SOL prices were trading down 2% on the day at $227 at the time of writing. The asset remains down more than 22% from its January 2025 all-time high. He said that Solana’s unstaking period is much faster than Ethereum’s, which is important because “ETFs need to be able to return assets on a very short time frame. So this is a huge challenge.” Avalanche: Treasury Company Sparks Price Surge The price of AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain, jumped after a newly formed company announced its plans to go public in the US and purchase over $1 billion worth of the token. The company, Avalanche Treasury Co., said on Wednesday that it would merge with the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp. in a deal valued at over $675 million. The merged company anticipates listing on the Nasdaq in the first quarter of 2026 under the ticker symbol “AVAT,” pending regulatory and shareholder approval. Emin Gün Sirer, the founder and CEO of the Avalanche blockchain development firm Ava Labs, will join the company as an adviser. The business will be the second so-called treasury company focused on Avalanche, joining a herd of companies going public or pivoting to buying and holding cryptocurrencies this year. Avalanche Treasury Co. said it has an “exclusive relationship” with the Avalanche Foundation, an organization that supports the blockchain, which had reportedly planned to sell millions of Avalanche tokens at a discounted price to treasury companies. The treasury company said it plans to own more than $1 billion worth of AVAX after it goes public next year, and its initial capital raise “will result in approximately $460 million in treasury assets funded.” Kaspa: High-Throughput Layer-1 Blockchain Kaspa is trading at approximately $0.075 to $0.08, with fluctuations mirroring those of the broader market. Recently, prices have fallen under pressure. It was predicted that the price could drop to about $0.058 in the near term. The price may receive support if it holds near $0.072 to $0.075. If the support holds and buyers step in, it may rebound to around $0.09 or $0.10. The volume of trade has increased now, with the market price at a neutral RSI. Kaspa is receiving popularity because the Layer-1 blockchain uses the GHOSTDAG protocol, which ensures scaling through parallel block creation. The project is highly recognized for strong developer growth and community governance (no VC and no pre-mining). Also, its claim to fame is high throughput. So, it is a strong project for 2025, but very high risk. An Early-Phase High-Upside Growth Opportunity While SOL , AVAX , and KAS are prominent altcoins for investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being noticed as a project that could be tipped as one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025. The project has a clear roadmap , a rapidly expanding community, and a growing adoption rate. Investors looking for high-upside growth opportunities are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE closely.

While Ueda faces a tough choice, the central bank has demonstrated its readiness for its first interest rate increase since January. This interest rate hike is expected to occur later this month. However, following Takaichi’s victory, if Ueda decides to proceed with the hike, he might upset a senior official who may desire more influence over the Bank of Japan’s future decisions. Ueda faces a difficult situation in deciding on interest rate hikes During the latter part of his term, Ueda is likely to be judged by individuals not only on how much he can increase interest rates but also on how effectively he can maintain the central bank’s independence . Concerning the situation, reports from reliable sources have highlighted that if the BOJ’s governor decides not to increase rates, as Takaichi’s economic advisers had suggested earlier, analysts speculate that he supports Takaichi’s critical approach to interest rate hikes. Consequently, this could further diminish the yen’s value, posing a significant challenge for both Ueda and Takaichi regarding currency matters as they await the next policy meeting scheduled for the next two months. In a statement, Tsuyoshi Ueno, a chief economist at the NLI Research Institute, pointed out that he has noticed an emerging prospect of an interest rate hike in October, following strong signals from the BOJ and reports on economic progress. However, Ueno also raised concerns that the increasing rates would become more difficult due to Takaichi’s victory. In the meantime, Ueda has showcased his dedication to addressing the leftover impacts of the BOJ’s large stimulus program as the country adapts to increasing inflation . Interestingly, he has already exceeded expectations by implementing strategies such as ending the bank’s influence on bond yields, reducing its large purchases, and ceasing other risky assets. Additionally, he plans to sell off exchange-traded funds before hitting the midpoint of his term. Many believe that increasing rates slowly from negative levels makes sense because inflation is still occurring. Takaichi’s victory raises concerns about interest rate hikes When the Bank of Japan moved to hike interest rates last year, Takaichi referred to the plan as “stupid,” leading investors to think she would halt rate rises if she became prime minister. This comes when she is expected to be elected as premier in a parliamentary vote in mid-October. “Ueda has done well in the first half of his term, but I think Takaichi is going to be harsher on him,” Ueno said. He made this remark in reference to her tendency to get involved in the BOJ’s plans whenever they consider making amendments to the policy settings. Responding to the situation, investors have drastically decreased their expectations for the BOJ’s move this month. On the other hand, Overnight swaps a week ago signaled a 68% probability of a hike in October, following two board members’ endorsement of an increase in September, and one typically dovish member sounded more hawkish. Later, that likelihood had fallen to just over 20%. Takaichi’s economic adviser greatly supported this shift on Monday this week. This was after Etsuro Honda told reporters it may be too early for a hike this month. Get seen where it counts.

The Dell Technologies chief explained that demand for computing power is “tremendous,” but the nonstop building of artificial intelligence data centers cannot continue forever. “I’m sure at some point there’ll be too many of these things built, but we don’t see any signs of that,” Michael said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” For now, the surge is still alive, and his company is right in the middle of it. The numbers back it up. The server networking business inside Dell jumped 58% in the past year and then another 69% in the last quarter alone, according to Michael. Growth has been fueled by large language models that now stretch beyond text into multimodal and multi-agent systems, each one pulling more power from chips and infrastructure. That hunger is what keeps orders flowing. Dell expands sales with Nvidia chips and big customers Michael explained that the company’s AI servers are powered by Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra chips.Those machines are then sold to heavy hitters like CoreWeave, a cloud service provider, and xAI, the startup run by Elon Musk.The stock market reacted quickly to this boom. Dell shares rose more than 3% on Tuesday, right after the company raised its long-term growth outlook in front of analysts. Michael lifted the company’s expected annual revenue growth to a range of 7% to 9%, up from the earlier 3% to 4% forecast.Diluted earnings per share are now expected to grow 15%, almost double the 8% previously targeted. This followed strong second-quarter earnings in August. Looking further ahead, Michael said the company plans to ship $20 billion worth of AI servers in fiscal 2026, which is double last year’s figure. But while sales are exploding, there’s a problem no one can ignore: power. “It’s the clear constraint that we hear about from our customers, including OpenAI,” Michael said. “Many customers, in fact, will tell us, ‘Well, don’t deliver it until this day because we won’t have power in the building to support it.’” Power supply questions loom over AI buildout The scale of these projects is staggering. In September, OpenAI announced a partnership with Nvidia to build at least 10 gigawatts of data centers. That equals the annual energy use of about 8 million U.S. households, based on analysis from CNBC using data from the Energy Information Administration. The largest tech names (Microsoft, Google, and Amazon) have also committed billions of dollars to new AI facilities. Michael pointed out that while Dell can design servers to be as energy-efficient as possible, the reality is that these new projects will consume staggering amounts of electricity. The concern is whether that energy even exists yet. Government data shows the U.S. grid is expected to add 63 gigawatts of capacity in 2025. The 10 gigawatts linked to OpenAI and Nvidia would eat up almost 16% of that total increase. “At the end of the day, if you’re going to generate tens of trillions of tokens, and you’re going to create intelligence and drive the economy forward, you’re going to need computing power and energy,” Michael said.

52820971,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=830478,1759884862,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52820971.jpeg,Thailand set for fourth rate cut under new BOT chief,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/thailand-set-for-fourth-rate-cut/,"New Bank of Thailand Governor Vitai Ratanakorn is expected to lead the country’s fourth interest rate cut this year as policymakers try to support an economy hurt by a strong currency, falling prices, and weak demand. The decision will test Vitai’s leadership and demonstrate his commitment to maintaining a loose monetary policy to support economic growth. The Bank of Thailand’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to reduce the one-day repurchase rate by 0.25 percentage points to 1.25% when it convenes on Wednesday. Most economists expect additional rate cuts in the coming months, as economic growth remains weak and inflation remains very low. BOT signals policy shift as inflation stays weak Vitai Ratanakorn said he wants to follow a friendly and flexible monetary policy that helps the economy grow steadily while also keeping the BOT free from political interference. His first Monetary Policy Committee meeting will reveal how he plans to steer the economy and the kind of message he wants to convey about Thailand’s future growth direction. The BOT lowered its main interest rate by a full percentage point since October 2024 to support the economy after a slow recovery from the pandemic. Some investors now believe there will be at least two more quarter-point cuts in the next six months. However, economists say the bank still needs to do more to help because the economy has not gained much momentum despite the rate cuts. Experts say prices have already been falling for several months, so cutting rates again won’t risk inflation. Economist at ANZ Group Holdings Ltd., Krystal Tan, said the “combination of subdued growth and absent price pressures supports the case for further policy easing.” He added that the policy rate in Thailand could drop to 1% by early next year if the current situation persists. People also don’t know what to expect from the next policy meeting because three of the seven members of the MPC are new, including Governor Vitai himself. The new entries might bring different opinions about how far the bank should go with rate cuts. Economists now have differing opinions, as some from Standard Chartered Bank suggest that the central bank might cut rates by 50 basis points, while analysts at Citigroup expect a smaller 25-basis-point cut. However, they warn that the central bank could be forced to make deeper cuts later this year if the global economy slows further or if exports weaken more sharply. The low level of inflation in Thailand could also lead to another rate cut, as it has remained below zero since April. The prices of goods and services have either stopped rising or have been falling because the current inflation rate is lower than the Bank of Thailand’s target range of 1% to 3%. Exports rose by 5.8% in August, but the increase was the smallest in nearly a year, and economists attribute this slowdown partly to U.S. tariffs. Markets are bracing for a softer baht and new economic support The strength of the Thai baht is also a concern for policymakers. The baht is now the third-best-performing currency in Asia, having gained more than 5% over the past six months. This growth has hurt the country’s exports because Thai goods are now more expensive for foreign buyers. It has also made Thailand a more expensive destination for tourists, who bring in valuable foreign currency. On the brighter side, the strong currency reduced the cost of imports, such as oil and machinery, but the benefit is far smaller than the losses faced by exporters and the tourism industry. The weaker U.S. dollar is one of the factors pushing the baht higher in recent months. Foreign investors are also showing interest in Thailand’s stock and bond markets because of expectations that Thailand’s new government will launch larger spending programs to boost growth. Their investments have increased the demand for the baht, but some of them worry that higher public debt may affect Thailand’s credit quality. These changes have sparked considerable interest among investors in what Governor Vitai Ratanakorn and the Bank of Thailand (BOT) will announce at the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. The MPC will announce its decision at 2 p.m. Bangkok time, and financial markets are tense but remain hopeful.

XRP, Hyperliquid (HYPE), and Avalanche (AVAX) have all entered watchlists thanks to technical patterns, support zones, and momentum signals. In addition to these, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly gaining mentions in analyst circles as one of the altcoins to keep an eye on. While the focus today is on the three above, many investors are using this moment to diversify into promising names that could outperform during early bull phases. XRP: Weakening support may invite pressure XRP turned down from the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($2.78) on Sunday and surged to the solid resistance at $2.89 on Monday. The repeated retest of a support level tends to weaken it. If the price breaks and closes below $2.69, the XRP/USDT pair will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern. That increases the risk of a fall toward $2.20. Any relief rally is expected to face selling at the moving averages and then at the downtrend line. The bulls will have to thrust and maintain the price above the downtrend line to indicate a comeback. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Can buyers defend $40? Hyperliquid (HYPE) continued its correction and reached the $40 support on Thursday, where the bulls are mounting a strong defense. The relief rally is expected to face selling at the moving averages. If the price turns down sharply from the moving averages, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the HYPE/USDT pair below $40. If they can pull it off, the Hyperliquid price could plummet to $35.50. On the contrary, if the price continues higher and breaks above $49.88, it suggests that the corrective phase may be over. The pair may then rally toward $59. Avalanche (AVAX): Testing key support after drop Avalanche recently turned down sharply and plunged below the 20-day EMA ($30.09), indicating that the bears are rushing to the exit. The AVAX/USDT pair has declined to the 50-day SMA ($26.62), which is likely to attract buyers. If the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA and rises above the 20-day EMA, it suggests buying at lower levels. The Avalanche price could then consolidate between $26.50 and $36.17 for some time. Instead, if sellers sink the price below the 50-day SMA, the pair could descend to $22.50. That brings the large $15.27 to $36.17 range into play. Analyst notes: Emerging altcoin getting quiet mentions In the backdrop of attention focused on XRP, HYPE, and AVAX, some analysts are also quietly flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as an interesting altcoin to monitor. Its growing community, capped token supply, and whales backing have drawn early interest. While it doesn’t dominate the headlines now, it’s being mentioned as a potential breakout name behind the scenes, especially by those looking for new opportunities beyond the familiar. This makes MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the best altcoins to buy this week for long term gains. Conclusion This week’s altcoin stories include XRP facing key support and resistance levels, HYPE battling to defend $40, and AVAX testing lower bands after sharp declines. Each shows signs of potential inflexion points, either for recovery or further correction. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly entering the conversation as a lesser-known altcoin with growing backing and structural advantages. For investors looking to balance safer names and promising newcomers, it’s worth keeping on the radar as well.

They all show key technical levels being tested — support zones, moving averages, and momentum signals that could clue in short-term direction. Q2: What happens if XRP falls below $2.69? That could complete a bearish triangle pattern and push price toward $2.20 based on the setup. Q3: For HYPE, is $40 a make-or-break level? Yes. If HYPE fails to hold $40, it could drop toward $35.50. A break above $49.88 would suggest the correction may be over. Q4: Why is MAGACOIN FINANCE being mentioned in this article? Because some analysts see it as one of the altcoins to watch behind today’s spotlight names. Its fundamentals and growing interest make it a possible breakout candidate beyond just this week.

The DeFi protocol oriented around utility, available for at $0.035 in presale, has become one of the most quickly developing tokens in Q4 because of its double lending architecture. With over 60% of its Stage 6 presale already sold and whale accounts hoarding increasingly more, Mutuum Finance could offer significantly more upside potential than titanic-cap tokens such as Solana. Solana Rally Continues Amidst Uncertainty Solana (SOL) threw some recent bullishness aside with its 19% gain and breach of the $230 level, technicals pointing to potential to continue to move higher to $253.4 if it can hold the support zone of $210.3–$217.1. Beneath that bullish trend, however, there are warning signs that are increasing. A few of the original investors are selling out, and this is a sign of increasing skepticism that the network is sustainable in the long term. At the same time, falling new address creation is evidence of falling adoption, something that can sap the strength of the existing rally and curtail upside beyond short-term rebounds. And even as Solana’s price action remains in the minds of traders, there are investors switching to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the upstart DeFi coin, which most experts think might have even more growth potential for it in the years ahead. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Phase 6 Tokens are priced at $0.035, 16.17% over the previous phase as Mutuum Finance explodes in presale stage 6. Investor investment is on the high side, with over 16,770 investors putting in over $16.9 million, a sign of confidence in long-term sustainability and prospects of the project in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). As a measure to promote adoption at an early stage, Mutuum Finance is conducting a $100,000 giveaway to reward $10,000 MUTM tokens to 10 winners. Mutuum Finance is dedicated to security. With CertiK, the platform holds a Bug Bounty Program with a $50,000 USDT reward. The program looks to compensate white-hat hackers and security researchers for identifying bugs within the codebase. Bugs are scored in terms of severity as critical, major, minor, and low, and the rewards are paid proportionate for actively securing and maintaining platform integrity. Deploying a Next-Generation Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has set a roadmap for building a next-gen lending and borrowing protocol with Version 1 (V1) live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. will be the key features. ETH and USDT will be the launchpad support for lending, borrowing, and collaterals, providing a safe, fast, and easy DeFi experience to users. Collateral efficiency is offered by accurately calculated Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, particularly in collateral-heavy loans. A buffer reserve is kept within the protocol to mitigate market uncertainty, and excess reserves are wisely reinvested in risk assets to absorb shock without negatively affecting system health as a whole. Such moves deliver a stable, resilient, and sustainable DeFi platform to all. Mutuum Finance is a High-Potential Alternative to SOL As Solana (SOL) eyes the $300 level, profit-taking by early birds and falling adoption ring bells for large-cap investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), at $0.035 with over 60% of Stage 6 presale sold out and 16,770+ investors on board, presents a strong alternative for DeFi exposure. With its dual lending mechanism, next-generation borrowing and lending protocol, dynamic Loan-to-Value ratios, and efficient collateral management, MUTM delivers security and scalable utility. Supported by a $50,000 USDT bug bounty fund and community initiatives like a $100,000 giveaway, Mutuum Finance is one of the most powerful under-$1 cryptos to watch out for in Q4 2025, with development-stage growth potential augmented by a nicely developed utility-driven strategy.

Solana is praised for its speed and ultra-low fees, making it ideal for high-frequency DeFi and gaming applications. At the same time, Ethereum continues to dominate in DeFi, developer activity, and institutional adoption. Alongside these two established networks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a high-upside altcoin to watch , potentially offering early investors exposure to exponential growth opportunities in the crypto space. Solana vs Ethereum: Comparing Speed, Fees, and Growth Potential Into the 2025 Rally Solana is significantly faster than Ethereum. It can handle about 870 transactions per second (TPS) on average, while it is capable of reaching peak rates of as high as 65,000 TPS and has a block time of approximately 0.39 seconds. The fast speed helps in high frequency defi applications and gaming. Ethereum’s base layer handles about 15 to 30 TPS. Layer-2 Solutions (rollups) are essential for scaling as they offer greater throughput without compromising security and decentralization. Fee comparisons Solana has incredibly low fees, at $0.000025, making it very cheap to send micropayments and transact often. The fees (gas costs) charged on Ethereum’s blockchain are higher and more volatile than Bitcoin’s. They range from $1 to over $30 during congestion. However, Layer-2 scaling on Ethereum is already starting to reduce costs. Growth and Market Outlook Due to its speed and low fees, Solana has strong price momentum and is well-positioned for quick adoption. Traders and applications that require high throughput will be attracted to this. Ethereum is the long-term leader in DeFi, developer activity, and institutional adoption. Significant upgrades (e.g. danksharding) will help with scaling and fee issues. Solana 7-day Price Chart: Source CMC The price of Solana is predicted to be around $232 by the end of 2025, with a possible maximum value of $482 by the end of the same year. Some analysts forecast that it will surpass $1,500 by 2030. Similarly, Ethereum recently broke the $4,000 level. Bullish analysts are forecasting that it will continue rising up to 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: High-Upside Altcoin Potential While Solana and Ethereum dominate discussions on speed, scalability, and adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly emerging as a high-upside growth altcoin . Investors seeking exposure to early-stage opportunities may consider MAGACOIN FINANCE for its structured roadmap , rapidly growing community, and potential for huge ROI , particularly through the promo code PATRIOT50X, which offers extra tokens. Community engagement and wallet activity continue to rise, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most notable altcoin opportunities emerging from Q4 2025. This positions MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential candidate for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolio with promising altcoins beyond the established layer-1 networks. Conclusion Comparing Solana and Ethereum , Solana’s speed and low fees offer strong adoption potential for DeFi and gaming, while Ethereum maintains dominance in institutional adoption and DeFi ecosystems . Following a comprehensive Hashex audit , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a 100% verified and trusted crypto presale, earning confidence from both retail investors and leading analysts. Combining established blockchain networks with early-stage altcoins enables a diversified approach that provides exposure to both proven projects and potential for exponential growth.

He also alluded to the Fed Master application as one of the interesting aspects amid the crypto firm’s move to obtain a national trust charter. Why Ripple Won’t Be A Regular Retail-Style Bank Vincent Van Code stated that Ripple won’t be a regular retail-style bank following the revelation that the crypto firm was a member of the American Bankers Association (ABA) . He stated that it was big news, but opined that Ripple’s application for a Fed Master account is more interesting. The software engineer added that it is surprising how the whole market is oblivious to these advancements and that the XRP price is still hovering around $3. Ripple had, through its subsidiary Standard Custody & Trust Company, applied for a Fed Master account at the same time it applied for a national banking license. The firm’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse , had explained back then that this would enable them to custody their RLUSD reserves directly with the Federal Reserve, further adding another layer of security for the stablecoin. Meanwhile, Crypto pundit unknowDLT was the one who pointed out that Ripple was a member of the ABA, while USDC issuer Circle, which has applied for a national banking license, is not. The pundit further remarked that this means that only one crypto company can be considered a bank. UnknowDLT indicated that big things are in store for Ripple and XRP , declaring that the crypto firm will become the world’s largest bank. UnknowDLT also echoed Vincent Van Code’s sentiment that the market is oblivious to the advancements that are on the horizon for Ripple and XRP. The crypto pundit claimed that retail investors are distracted by memes and Bitcoin. The pundit further remarked that people think that Ripple is dumping XRP on retail investors while the firm continues to build the infrastructure for the new financial system. UnknowDLT added that people have not realized the great potential for appreciation that the XRP will have. The Firm’s Application Open For Public Review XRP influencer Pumpius revealed that Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking license from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is now open for public review. He remarked that the crypto firm is becoming a bank and that the same company the SEC fought for years is now positioning itself as the “bank of banks” built not on legacy rails but on the XRP Ledger . Pumpius added that Ripple’s shift from a crypto company to a liquidity institution is almost complete. It is worth mentioning that the crypto firm is one of many firms that have applied for a national banking license, including Paxos and Circle. Crypto exchange Coinbase also filed for a national trust charter last week.",Ripple|ABA|American Bankers Association|bitcoin|Brad Garlinghouse|Circle|coinbase|Fed Master|OCC|Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Paxos|Pumpius|ripple|ripple news|RLUSD|stablecoin|Standard Custody & Trust Company|UnknowDLT|US SEC|USDC|Vincent Van Code|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|XRP|EXCHANGE|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-08 01:00:22

With the cryptocurrency currently trading around $0.26 after crashing severely in the past few months, the report of new upgrades raises the question of whether these developments could trigger a strong enough comeback to spark a 900% rally back to $2.98. Could Pi Network’s New DeFi Upgrades Spark A Rally? Pi Network’s price faced a devastating correction over the course of eight months, plunging from its February peak of $2.98 to just around $0.26 today. The decline erased more than $18 billion in value in just six months, sparking rugpull accusations as heavy sell-offs from whales and rapidly shifting sentiment drove the market into a downward spiral. Related Reading: Pi Network Price Crashes 88% Since Launch, New Developments Say Further Decline Is Coming At current levels, the cryptocurrency would need a near tenfold rally to revisit its all-time high. Such a rebound is theoretically possible in crypto markets, where significant developments often drive exponential gains. However, with the PI price down more than 85% from peak levels, a surge of that scale remains uncertain. Despite its decline, optimism has resurfaced following Pi Network’s latest ecosystem updates, which could signal a shift from speculation toward sustainable utility. According to the Pi Core Team on X social media, the launch of the Pi DEX, AMM liquidity pools, and token creation tools on Testnet marks the beginning of the cryptocurrency’s new DeFi era. These tools allow Pioneers to swap tokens, provide liquidity, mint test tokens, and explore DeFi mechanics in a safe testing environment. The team noted that the rollout is designed to educate and prepare the community for a full-scale Mainnet DeFi launch where real PI tokens could power transactions and liquidity. They also stated that Pi Network’s vision is to fuel long-term, sustainable Web3 growth through its system designed for utility, apps, and real-world use cases. They added that this vision of steady value appreciation is supported by PI’s infrastructure, KYC-verified global community, Pi wallet and ecosystem apps, .pi Domains, Oi Ad Network, staking, and more. A Deeper Dive Into Pi Network’s DeFi Revolution Pi network’s DeFi expansion, unveiled by founder Dr Chengdiao Fan at the TOKEN2049 global conference in Singapore, represents a strategic pivot toward creating tangible value within its blockchain ecosystem. According to the network’s official blog post, the launch of the Pi DEX and AMM pool will enable the community to build their own DEX and AMM interfaces in a secure testing space. The team noted that this function remains restricted on the Mainnet at this time and is invalid for use or any other purposes. Related Reading: Pi Network Price Crashes To All-Time Low After Latest Announcement — Details Token creation capabilities on the network will also enable developers to mint test tokens on Pi Testnet, simulating app-level economies, community reward systems, and service-based tokens. When the feature transitions to Mainnet, the blog post highlights that strict guidelines will ensure only utility-driven tokens, not empty incentive mechanisms such as meme coins, are approved. This reduces speculative risks and encourages sustainable growth.

Jensen explained the deal on Tuesday during the CNBC Investing Club’s Monthly Meeting at the New York Stock Exchange, adding that OpenAI will now buy Nvidia systems straight from the company instead of through cloud providers. “This is a partnership that, for the first time, OpenAI is going to buy directly from us,” Jensen said. “Usually…a cloud service provider buys from us, and they rent from a cloud service provider. And so now it’s going to be a direct partnership.” The deal is backed by numbers that show just how large it is.Nvidia announced in September that it plans to invest up to $100 billion into OpenAI to build out artificial intelligence data centers.Both companies said the systems will require 10 gigawatts of power. Jensen told CNBC that this amount of energy is the same as running between 4 million and 5 million GPUs. That puts OpenAI on track to run its own computing infrastructure rather than relying on someone else’s servers. Nvidia signs direct AI infrastructure deal The partnership comes as both Nvidia and OpenAI are driving the current AI boom. Demand for Nvidia’s chips began three years ago when OpenAI first released ChatGPT, which introduced generative AI to millions of users. Since then, Nvidia’s market cap has more than tripled, reaching over $4 trillion and making it the most valuable company on the market. Jensen told Cramer that the OpenAI deal is “incremental” compared to Nvidia’s earlier partnerships with Oracle and CoreWeave, because this time OpenAI will run its own data centers. “We’re going to help them build an AI infrastructure that they operate themselves … and really set them up for, you know, five years out, when they’re going to operate their own cloud anyhow,” Jensen said. During the conversation, Jensen and Cramer also talked about China, global trade, and competition with rivals like AMD and Intel. The focus stayed on the scale of the OpenAI agreement, which changes how these massive AI operations are set up. Intel, facing its own challenges, is preparing to show technical details about its next laptop chip called Panther Lake. Four people briefed on the matter allegedly told Reuters that the company will release the information on Thursday. Panther Lake is the first Intel chip built fully with its 18A manufacturing process, a technology the company has spent billions on. It will power high-end laptops and is part of Intel’s push to recover ground lost to AMD. Intel prepares Panther Lake rollout Intel ran hours of technical briefings and factory tours in Arizona last week to present the new Panther Lake microarchitecture to analysts and journalists. The briefings included details about redesigned graphics cores, processor cores, and a new AI engine. Panther Lake will be the first large-scale Intel product made with 18A. The previous generation, called Lunar Lake, was made mostly by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel said Panther Lake will be available in early 2026, and it will use 30% less energy while delivering a 50% boost in certain data-processing tasks. The pressure on Intel is heavy. The company reported a $2.9 billion loss in the second quarter. It also said it could suspend its planned 14A process if it failed to secure a customer. In August, President Donald Trump called for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign. That sparked new investment into the company. Intel secured money from SoftBank Group and Nvidia, while the White House agreed to convert a CHIPS Act grant into a 9.9% equity stake in Intel after Tan met with Trump and officials.

52821717,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=830486,1759886087,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52821717.jpeg,Canary Capital’s HBAR ETF nears SEC approval,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/canary-capitals-hbar-etf-nears-sec-approval/,"A recent filing by Canary Capital has brought the market one step closer to a key milestone, the potential approval of a spot ETF tracking Hedera Hashgraph’s (HBAR) native token. The submission has fueled optimism among investors and analysts, many of whom believe the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could finally break its streak of delays and grant long-awaited approval. On Tuesday, Canary Capital filed an amended registration statement for its proposed Canary HBAR ETF with the ticker symbol of HBR and a sponsor’s fee of 0.95%. The firm is also verifying an equivalent Litecoin ETF pending under ticker LTCC, with the same fee structure. These last-minute details, tickers, and sponsor fees are typically the final steps before an ETF receives regulators’ blessing. Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas drove that point home in a post on X, where he wrote that “those are the last things to get filled in before go-time.” The 0.95% fee is “pricey compared with Bitcoin ETFs,” says Blockforce Capital founder and crypto asset manager Eric Ervin, but not for newer and more niche products entering the ETF space as a way to gain exposure to cryptos in an already crowded market. The HBAR and Litecoin ETFs are on the 1-yard line, Bloomberg Intelligence’s James Seyffart said, suggesting that a green light will come as soon as the SEC is fully functioning again. This positive new optimism is also backed by HBAR, Solana, and XRP ETFs, which have been listed on the Depository Trust, a technical step that precedes trading approval. The Nasdaq has also filed a Form 19b-4, the regulatory filing form required for the listing and trading of shares of the HBAR ETF once it has been greenlighted. This frenetic blur of activity paints a picture of an ETF that is well past the drawing board phase and is just waiting for the ultimate say-so from one last regulator. SEC delay slows momentum However, in a surprising turn of events, the SEC has delayed its decision on Canary’s HBAR ETF. The next review date has now been extended to November 8, 2025, providing the agency with additional time to conduct its administrative reviews and internal assessments. Industry watchers said that at first glance, the Canary’s HBAR ETF delay seemed more procedural than negative. It was not a rejection, but rather the same process, one market analyst said, with the SEC methodically considering all the proposed crypto ETF applications in its docket after being overwhelmed with new product submissions this year. The delay also comes at a time when the US government is shut down, cutting off some of the SEC’s operations. Its contingency plan permits only a handful of employees to address “emergencies.” That includes some procedures, such as ETF approvals, which have been temporarily halted. Nonetheless, the momentum for crypto ETFs was strong as news reportedly broke that the SEC had recently approved new listing rules designed to streamline the process of approving digital asset ETFs. Crypto ETF market expands rapidly The filing by Canary Capital is part of a wave of broader crypto ETF activity. On that same day, global investment firm GraniteShares applied for a suite of leveraged ETFs linked to Solana, XRP, and Ethereum. Last week, at least 70 other asset managers also filed similar applications, indicating a sharp rise in institutional demand for regulated crypto exposure. The world’s crypto ETFs are setting a new record for total inflows. Worldwide crypto ETFs have attracted almost $5.95 billion in new investments just this month as Bitcoin hits new highs, according to Reuters. Some analysts believe this excitement is also fueled by speculation that the SEC will, at some point in time, greenlight more altcoin ETFs (like HBAR and Litecoin). The approval of the Canary HBAR ETF would be a major win for the Hedera network, which touts itself as a faster, more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional blockchains. The ETF listing will also open up a larger market of institutional HBAR investors who prefer regulated investments. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

As digital assets go mainstream, opportunities once reserved for institutions are now within reach for everyday investors. According to a recent report from Bitget Research, over 580 million people worldwide now own some form of cryptocurrency , up 35% year-over-year, a clear signal that crypto has become a core component of global finance. This shift isn’t just about adoption; it’s about access. Crypto is transforming from a speculative frontier into a generational wealth machine. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), payment integrations, and cross-border infrastructure are making it easier than ever for individuals to build portfolios that would’ve been impossible a decade ago. As major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and JPMorgan deepen their presence in blockchain-based assets, analysts argue the next crypto bull market could create the largest wave of new millionaires in history. But while established coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to anchor institutional portfolios, it’s the emerging altcoins , with asymmetric upside potential, that could define who rises next. The Mainstream Explosion: Crypto’s Institutional Validation The current market cycle is unlike any before. In just the last quarter, global crypto ETFs saw more than $7.6 billion in inflows , the fastest institutional accumulation since Bitcoin’s inception. This surge in regulated participation has legitimized crypto in the eyes of traditional investors, paving the way for retail adoption on an unprecedented scale. From corporate balance sheets to pension funds, digital assets are evolving into a standard allocation. PayPal’s blockchain integration, Visa’s stablecoin settlement expansion, and the SEC’s wave of ETF approvals have collectively created a “no-turning-back” moment. Analyst Michael van de Poppe summarized it best: “Crypto isn’t the future anymore, it’s the present. Every day you wait, you’re letting institutional players front-run your chance at exponential growth.” Yet while Bitcoin remains the safest store of value, the real generational wealth often stems from identifying the next breakout narrative early, something that projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are now embodying. Crypto’s rapid march into the mainstream is redefining what’s possible for investors. As institutional adoption rises and retail participation explodes, new-generation altcoins are becoming the engines of exponential wealth creation. Analysts now highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top contender for the next 50×–70× cycle multiplier , citing its viral momentum and disciplined tokenomics. The presale’s current price of $0.00051213 and planned listing at $0.007 encode a built-in 13.6× appreciation window , even before secondary markets open. Verified by CertiK and HashEx , MAGACOIN FINANCE combines meme-style community energy with credible structure, a blend that’s rare in this sector. For investors chasing the next phase of mass adoption, it offers the perfect convergence of accessibility, scarcity, and early-stage upside. As crypto goes fully mainstream, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE aren’t just part of the trend, they’re leading it. The New Path to Wealth: From Accumulation to Acceleration Becoming a crypto millionaire isn’t about luck, it’s about understanding timing, conviction, and diversification. Historically, bull markets follow a predictable rhythm: Bitcoin leads – drawing institutional liquidity. Ethereum follows – reinforcing trust and technical momentum. Altcoins explode – delivering the exponential gains that change lives. In 2021, tokens like Solana, Shiba Inu, and Polygon all produced returns ranging from 40× to 120× in less than a year. Analysts now believe the 2025 setup mirrors that same dynamic, but with even greater capital inflows and global participation. For those entering the market today, the combination of institutional validation and retail enthusiasm makes this cycle uniquely fertile. The difference between a 2× gain and a 50× windfall will come down to early identification of breakout assets, a pattern MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be repeating. Global Momentum: Crypto Adoption and Generational Opportunity Countries across Asia, Latin America, and Europe are embracing crypto as both payment infrastructure and investment vehicle. From El Salvador’s Bitcoin bonds to Japan’s Web3 development incentives, governments are fueling the mainstream wave. According to Chainalysis, emerging markets now account for over 50% of all crypto activity , highlighting a paradigm shift in global finance. At the same time, corporate adoption continues to rise. Nasdaq-listed firms are integrating crypto into treasury strategies, and fintech platforms are offering blockchain exposure to millions of users worldwide. These signals suggest a single conclusion: the window for early positioning is closing. The next 12–18 months could produce life-changing outcomes for those who align early with narrative-driven, transparent projects. Conclusion: The Era of Accessible Wealth For decades, wealth generation was gated behind institutional privilege. Today, crypto has dismantled that barrier. Becoming a millionaire has never been more accessible, but it requires foresight and disciplined speculation. Bitcoin may define the standard, but projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE represent the frontier, where community, scarcity, and structure converge. As digital assets solidify their role in global finance, those who identify credible early movers could stand among the next generation of crypto millionaires. The next wave isn’t coming. It’s already here, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is riding at the front of it.

Strategy holds 640,031 BTC (~$80B at peak): Its BTC stash briefly approached the cash positions of Amazon, Google and Microsoft (each ~ $95–97B). Strategy’s average buy price was $73,981, delivering roughly a 65% unrealized gain (~$30.4B).

What is Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury and how large is it? Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury is a corporate reserve composed of 640,031 BTC purchased at an average price of $73,981. At Bitcoin’s recent record high near $126,080 the stash briefly topped $80 billion in market value, elevating Strategy into the top tier of corporate treasury valuations. Strategy’s approach combines regular purchases with long-term holding, creating a prominent BTC-based component of its corporate balance sheet. Source: Strategy How does Strategy’s Bitcoin stash compare to major tech cash positions? Strategy’s Bitcoin value, near $80 billion at peak, sits close to the cash or cash-equivalent holdings reported by Amazon, Google and Microsoft (each roughly $95–97 billion). Berkshire Hathaway remains the largest corporate cash holder at about $344 billion. Tesla also appears among top corporate treasuries and holds 11,509 BTC, worth roughly $1.4 billion — a small share of its overall cash position (~$37 billion). Why did Microsoft and Meta reject Bitcoin proposals? Microsoft and Meta shareholders voted against proposals to explore Bitcoin as a treasury asset primarily due to concerns about volatility and risk management. The proposals were submitted by a conservative think tank representative advocating for Bitcoin as a hedge against currency debasement. Decision factors cited by shareholders included price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and fiduciary duty to protect short-term capital. When did corporate Bitcoin adoption accelerate in 2025? Corporate Bitcoin adoption surged in 2025, with over 200 public companies holding BTC — up from fewer than 100 at the start of the year. Rising prices and institutional familiarity drove many firms to adopt or increase allocations to Bitcoin. Strategy’s purchases have been a major driver of market attention, with its average buy price and subsequent unrealized gain frequently reported in corporate finance updates. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/strategy-bitcoin-treasury"" }, ""headline"": ""Strategy’s $80B Bitcoin Treasury Nears Tech Cash Giants"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199c164-5564-7fc7-b09d-9eddb48ad0d1.png""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-08T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-08T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Strategy’s 640,031 BTC treasury briefly reached about $80 billion, bringing its Bitcoin holdings close to the cash positions of major tech companies.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How many Bitcoins does Strategy hold?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Strategy holds 640,031 BTC purchased at an average price of $73,981, which briefly reached an approximate market value of $80 billion at recent highs."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Did major tech companies miss gains by not adding Bitcoin to treasury?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes; Microsoft and Meta rejected proposals to explore Bitcoin when BTC was trading substantially lower, missing double-digit gains as Bitcoin rose to record highs."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How many public companies hold Bitcoin in 2025?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Over 200 public companies held Bitcoin in 2025, up from fewer than 100 at the start of the year, reflecting rapid corporate adoption."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How companies can evaluate adding Bitcoin to the corporate treasury"", ""description"": ""A concise 4-step approach for corporate finance teams to assess Bitcoin as a treasury asset."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199c164-5564-7fc7-b09d-9eddb48ad0d1.png"", ""totalTime"": ""PT14D"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess strategic objectives"", ""text"": ""Define why Bitcoin would be added (e.g., inflation hedge, diversification) and set target allocation limits (commonly 0.5–5%)."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Run risk and liquidity analysis"", ""text"": ""Model volatility impact, liquidity needs, and scenario-based stress tests to ensure treasury stability."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Establish custody and controls"", ""text"": ""Select institutional custody, multi-signature governance, and audit trails to meet fiduciary standards."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Implement phased allocation"", ""text"": ""Start with a small, monitored allocation and scale based on governance, compliance and market conditions."" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How much gain has Strategy realized on its Bitcoin holdings? Strategy’s average purchase price was $73,981 per BTC. With Bitcoin trading near recent highs, the position shows about a 65% unrealized gain — approximately $30.4 billion in market uplift. What risks do companies cite when rejecting Bitcoin for treasuries? Shareholder concerns commonly include high volatility, regulatory uncertainty, accounting treatment, and potential fiduciary risks tied to short-term valuation swings. Key Takeaways Scale: Strategy’s 640,031 BTC briefly reached ~ $80B, rivaling large tech cash positions. Performance: Average buy price of $73,981 implies ~65% unrealized gains on the position. Adoption trend: Corporate Bitcoin holdings expanded rapidly in 2025, with 200+ public companies holding BTC. Conclusion Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury has emerged as one of the largest corporate Bitcoin reserves, bringing BTC into direct comparison with major tech cash piles. As corporate adoption grows, the debate over Bitcoin’s role as an inflation hedge and treasury asset will continue to shape boardroom and shareholder decisions. For treasury teams, measured governance and robust risk controls remain essential.

The new round is larger than originally expected and is tied to xAI’s plan to use Nvidia processors for Colossus 2, its biggest data center located in Memphis. The total package mixes equity and debt. Reports show that about $7.5 billion is equity while as much as $12.5 billion comes in debt. The deal is structured through a special purpose vehicle that buys Nvidia GPUs and rents them back to xAI for five years, giving financiers a path to recover their money without exposing themselves to company-level risk. Nvidia has not commented on the transaction, while xAI also declined to respond. Elon himself wrote on X in September that the company was “not raising any capital right now,” though this financing proves otherwise. Nvidia invests while Wall Street funds the debt Nvidia is investing equity as a strategy to push its chips deeper into customer systems. The company’s Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told a Goldman Sachs conference in September that while Nvidia will continue to repurchase shares and pursue strategic deals, its main use of cash is to help other companies adopt AI more quickly. Other financiers are backing the debt. Apollo Global Management is participating alongside Diameter Capital Partners. Valor Capital is leading the equity portion, with Apollo also investing. None of these firms gave public comment when contacted. The raise is more than double the earlier $10 billion figure reported earlier this year, showing the scale of demand for hardware and financing in the AI race. The debt itself is unusual because it is backed by Nvidia’s processors instead of the company. By renting chips for a set period, xAI provides investors with predictable returns while keeping corporate liabilities separate. The arrangement is being seen as a potential model for other tech firms aiming to secure capital without stacking too much debt directly on their books. AI giants secure record amounts for infrastructure The deal comes in the middle of unprecedented capital raising across the AI sector. OpenAI announced a multi‑year partnership to run its systems on Advanced Micro Devices chips. Meta has agreed to a financing deal worth $29 billion for data center expansion. Oracle pulled together $38 billion in debt for its infrastructure. Altogether, tech companies in U.S. bond markets have secured $157 billion so far this year, a 70% increase compared with last year. For Elon, this capital is critical. Bloomberg reported that xAI has already burned through $1 billion per month while building its infrastructure. Earlier this year, the company raised about $10 billion in a mix of debt and equity. Elon has also drawn on his other companies, with SpaceX already investing in xAI. Later this year, Tesla investors will vote on whether to put money into the startup as well. Data center capacity remains a central issue in AI development, as training large models requires huge computing power. While some in the industry debate how much more power will actually improve results, few argue against the need to secure hardware at scale. Elon has positioned AI at the center of his product vision, describing it as the foundation for self‑driving vehicles and fully autonomous robots. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

While the region remains resilient for now, supported by strong public investment, the impact of rising trade tensions is expected to emerge next year. Growth in South Asia is forecast to decelerate from 6.6% in 2025 to 5.8% in the following year, the World Bank said in its latest South Asia Development Update released on Tuesday. The report includes India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and the Maldives. The downgrade reflects the anticipated drag from higher tariffs on Indian goods when exported to U.S. markets, as well as weaker overall export performance. U.S. taxes Indian exports and labour-intensive industries The slowdown is largely attributed to trade tensions between the United States and India. U.S. President Donald Trump had earlier this year announced a 50% “import tariff” on nearly half of all Indian exports, one of the most aggressive tariffs ever levied on any US trade partner. The move covers trade in approximately $50 billion worth of exports, and India’s labor-intensive sectors are likely to be hit the hardest. Sectors like textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods, and shrimp are particularly feeling the heat. Exporters in these sectors tend to be small and medium-sized enterprises that depend heavily on the U.S. market, which accounts for approximately one-fifth of India’s total exports. About three-quarters of Indian goods sold to the United States are now being levied these tariffs. The World Bank stated that while the Indian economy is currently bolstered by government spending and domestic demand, these tariffs will have a gradual negative impact on growth from the middle of this year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has been making aggressive strides to alleviate the pressure. Last month, officials announced the largest tax overhaul since 2017, slashing duties on many goods — from shampoos to automobile parts — to spur domestic consumption and business sentiment. While doing so, India has continued to increase spending on infrastructure – including roads, railways, and energy projects – in the hope of spurring economic growth and private investment. These steps are part of a larger plan to strengthen India’s growth foundation amid a global slowdown. The World Bank has raised its projection for India’s growth in the current fiscal year (through March 2026) to 6.5%, from 6.3%. However, it reduced its forecast for the next fiscal year to 6.3%, partly due to the expected drag from tariffs and softer global demand. South Asia’s regional ripple effects India’s economic slide seems certain to wash across its neighbors as well. As the largest economy in South Asia, India accounts for more than 75% of the GDP in this subregion; as such, trade and investment linkages carry significant implications for countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Bangladesh, for example, whose textile and garment exports end up in goods sold around the world, may see less demand for the intermediate goods it ships to India. Sri Lanka, which is dealing with a financial crisis of its own, heavily relies on tourism and trade links with India, which could fade if growth outpaces the need for exports. Remittances and export earnings could also fall for Nepal and Bhutan, destination countries with economies closely connected to India’s. The World Bank report stated that the slowdown in Indian exports would have a ripple effect throughout the region, affecting its industrial supply chains, transportation, and trade services. Trade diversification for South Asia is a key long-term lesson to draw from its current situation. Economists advise, among other things, increasing exports to emerging markets in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, as well as investing more in value-added industries, to reduce dependence on just one or two key trade partners. The World Bank also highlighted the importance of regional cooperation, including in technology, green energy, and digital trade. Greater regional integration of South Asian economies could help reduce external shocks and open new markets. India’s Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, stated that the government would continue to increase its capital spending and support industries through credit and innovation.

Related Reading: Here’s The Best Time To Buy Bitcoin As Impulse Wave Sets Path To $150,000 While near-term momentum has flipped bearish, several on-chain and market-structure cues still point to a potential rebound toward $55–$60 if buyers can quickly stabilize the price above key supports. Derivatives Tilt Bearish, but Spot Holds the Line Futures positioning has swung defensively, and according to Coinglass, the long-to-short ratio slipped to 0.80, its lowest in over a month, signaling traders are leaning short into weakness. Momentum indicators echo the caution, daily RSI near 45 sits below the neutral 50 line, and MACD registered a bearish cross, both consistent with cooling trend strength. Technically, HYPE failed a back-test of a broken ascending trendline and bled nearly 7% from Friday to Monday, with charts flagging $39–$40 as the next major support if selling accelerates. On the upside, $51–$52 is first resistance, where bulls likely meet clustered supply from recent breakdown levels. Why Hyperliquid (HYPE) Bulls Still See $55–$60 on the Table Despite the red prints, spot activity remains constructive. Hyperliquid has been defending the mid-$40s repeatedly, and prior consolidations above $45–$47 have preceded strong continuation moves. HYPE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: HYPEUSD on Tradingview Under the hood, token staking north of 660,000 HYPE ($30million) plus systematic buybacks are reducing circulating supply, creating a supportive backdrop when demand returns. Meanwhile, protocol fee revenue around $3million/day underscores durable usage even as new perp-DEX competitors court volume with incentives. Community and analyst “fair-value” chatter continues to cluster around $55–$60, suggesting sentiment will likely flip quickly if price reclaims the short-term breakdown area. Price Levels and Trade Map for the Week The immediate trading point sits in $44–$49. A daily close back above $49 would neutralize the breakdown and open $52, then $55–$60 as momentum targets. Failure to hold $46–$47 invites a retest of $44, with a deeper flush risking the $39–$40 demand zone where dip-buyers may step in.

One such debate gaining traction revolves around Tron (TRX) – a veteran of the crypto scene – and MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-emerging altcoin that has captured massive investor attention following its record-breaking presale and multiple audit approvals. While Tron continues to hold a strong position in the market with its established user base and DeFi presence, many analysts now believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver far greater upside potential in the coming years. Here’s how the two stack up in terms of fundamentals, growth prospects, and long-term investment appeal. Tron’s Established Ecosystem and Strong Network Activity Launched in 2017, Tron has built a solid reputation as one of the most active smart contract platforms in the blockchain space. The network’s low transaction fees and high throughput have made it a preferred option for decentralized applications (dApps) and stablecoin transfers. One of Tron’s biggest strengths lies in its dominance in stablecoin circulation , particularly with USDT. Data from DeFiLlama shows that a majority of Tether’s on-chain supply flows through the Tron network, accounting for billions of dollars in daily transactions. This widespread usage has given Tron a steady stream of network revenue and consistent demand for TRX tokens. Additionally, Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, has actively pursued partnerships and cross-chain integrations, helping sustain visibility even during bearish periods. However, critics argue that Tron’s growth has plateaued in recent years, with limited innovation beyond its existing DeFi and payments ecosystem. While Tron remains a dependable blockchain with high utility, its upside potential may be constrained compared to newer entrants that are still in early growth stages. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Power Player on the Rise MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the most talked-about projects of 2025. Following its HashEX and CertiK audits, investor confidence has skyrocketed, with the token’s presale phases selling out faster than anticipated. Analysts now project that MAGACOIN FINANCE could outperform Tron in long-term growth and even secure a position among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap within the next cycle. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its strategic blend of transparency, community focus, and real development momentum. Early investors have already seen returns exceeding 7,800% during the presale period, and many believe that’s just the beginning. The project’s tokenomics are structured to reward long-term holders through deflationary mechanisms and a growing ecosystem that continues to attract attention from retail and institutional investors alike. In addition, MAGACOIN FINANCE benefits from being early in its lifecycle. Historically, coins entering the market with strong fundamentals, visible audits, and an active community tend to outperform older assets once listings begin. With upcoming exchange launches and ecosystem expansion on the roadmap, analysts see enormous potential for sustained upward movement. Many in the community are already drawing parallels between MAGACOIN FINANCE and the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin , both of which delivered life-changing gains for early participants. However, unlike those meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE aims to combine viral community strength with real technological development – a mix that could position it for lasting relevance. Comparing the Two: Growth vs. Stability When comparing Tron and MAGACOIN FINANCE, the decision often comes down to an investor’s risk tolerance and time horizon. Tron offers stability, predictable growth, and a proven network that consistently processes billions in stablecoin volume. It’s a reliable asset for those seeking long-term exposure to an established blockchain. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, represents aggressive growth potential. It’s a project still in its expansion phase, meaning early entrants could benefit from exponential upside if it continues to deliver on its roadmap and secure large-scale listings. The token’s audited security, rapid adoption, and viral traction all point to a project that’s moving with momentum rarely seen since the early bull runs of 2021. For many investors, the strategy may not be to choose one or the other, but rather to balance between the established strength of Tron and the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Yet, those who favor higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities are increasingly leaning toward the latter. Conclusion Tron remains a respected, functional, and active network that continues to serve as a backbone for stablecoin transfers and DeFi activity. However, in terms of future growth potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the more dynamic contender. With full audit verifications, rapid presale sellouts, and a roadmap geared toward innovation and community expansion, it’s no surprise that analysts expect it to outperform Tron and potentially enter the top 100 cryptos by market cap in the next cycle. For investors seeking the next big opportunity with strong fundamentals and explosive upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the standout pick for the long term.

Coinbase Premium Gap Is Positive Right Now In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap . This indicator measures the difference between the BTC price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). The former cryptocurrency exchange is the primary hub for US-based investors, particularly large institutional entities, while the latter is utilized by traders worldwide. As such, the Coinbase Premium Gap essentially represents the difference in behavior between American whales and global ones. When the value of the metric is positive, it means the price of the asset listed on Coinbase is higher than that on Binance. Such a trend implies users of the former are applying a higher buying pressure (or lower selling pressure) than those of the latter. On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark implies Binance users are the ones participating in a higher amount of accumulation, as they have pushed the asset to a higher price on the platform. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past week: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has remained at mostly positive levels for the past few days, suggesting that buyers on Coinbase have been more aggressive at buying the cryptocurrency than Binance users during this rally . The metric reached its high on October 3rd, when BTC traded at a premium of $140 on Coinbase. During the weekend, the indicator saw some cooldown, with it even briefly turning red during the all-time high (ATH) break on Saturday, but it has surged again in the new week and recovered to a notable positive level of $105. Thus, it seems that despite Bitcoin now entering ATH exploration mode, US-based institutions are only continuing to accumulate more of the cryptocurrency. These investors have been one of the main drivers in the market since last year, so if the Coinbase Premium Gap continues to remain green, the rally could potentially sustain for longer. Speaking of institutional demand, another metric that can correspond to buying/selling from the cohort is the netflow for the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . These investment vehicles saw massive net inflows during the past week, providing further evidence of institutional accumulation. As the above chart shared by cycle analyst Root shows, the latest week of spot ETF inflows was 8.8 times the new Bitcoin supply that miners minted in the period. BTC Price Bitcoin breached above $126,000 on Monday to set another new ATH, but it has since cooled off a bit, with its price coming back to $124,300.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap|Bitcoin Institutional Buying|btc|BTCUSDT|coinbase,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BTC|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-08 02:00:55

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. A7A5’s appearance at the recent Token2049 conference wasn’t in contravention of Singaporean law, despite being backed by a sanctioned Russian bank, highlighting the limits of the city-state’s sanctions regime, which applies only to licensed financial firms. A7A5's ruble-based stablecoin is backed by Russia’s state-owned Promsvyazbank (PSB), an entity sanctioned by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) as well as financial authorities in the U.S., U.K., and most Western jurisdictions . Bloomberg recently reported that the E.U., as a bloc, is considering sanctions against A7A5 too . Indeed, an audit prepared for Old Vector LLC, the parent company behind A7A5, warns of possible ""redemption and regulatory issues"" regarding use of the tokens considering the breadth of the sanctions. Given A7A5 was a sponsor at Token2049, complete with booths and branded massage rooms , one has to wonder if this contravened Singaporean rules given the exchange of funds. The answer, according to MAS, is no. ""Singapore financial institutions (FI) are not permitted to facilitate transactions (whether directly or indirectly) for designated persons in contravention of our financial measures,"" a MAS Spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email. ""An entity that is not an FI regulated by the MAS is not subject to the financial measures."" Under Singapore’s sanctions framework, financial measures targeting Russia’s Promsvyazbank and related entities bind banks, insurers, capital-markets intermediaries, and digital payment token providers. But, according to MAS' own guidance , non-financial companies and individuals are only obligated to comply with United Nations-mandated sanctions, which have never been applied to Russia as the country would veto them as a member of the U.N. security council. Furthermore, Token2049 is organized by Hong Kong registered BOB Group . Hong Kong, as part of China, does not have any financial sanctions on Russia which makes recieving funds from A7A5 legal in the territory. Singapore's sanctions are a bit different from what's been imposed in the U.S. where the company behind A7A5 is Specially Designated National (SDN) under U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) meaning U.S. persons are prohibited from interacting with them in any way. It may seem like an edge case, but Foundation for Global Political Exchange v. U.S. Treasury shows just how far those restrictions can go. OFAC initially denied the Foundation for Global Political Exchange, a U.S. nonprofit, permission to host members of Hezbollah – understandably sanctioned individuals – at a forum they organized in Beiruit about peace in the middle east, ruling that simply offering a platform or audience constituted a prohibited service under U.S. sanctions law. Only after a first amendment challenge did OFAC reverse its position, narrowly allowing participation under strict conditions: no payments, no lodging, no coordination, and no affiliation with the event’s host. By that standard, even in the U.S., hosting A7A5 could be legal if no money or material support changed hands. In Singapore, where sanctions bind financial institutions but not conference organizers, it’s an even easier call. Washington regulates who you can pay; Singapore regulates who can move the money.

Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Wednesday, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 hovered around 48,120 — buoyed by optimism over pro-growth policies under new LDP leadership and a tech-fueled global rally, even as concerns about stimulus durability and valuation risks linger.

Resistance sits at $3.05–$3.12; support ranges are $2.85–$2.90 and $2.20–$2.40. Futures open interest and volume spikes on Oct 3–4 signal increased conviction and potential volatility. XRP price testing $3.10 resistance; watch volume and futures open interest to confirm a breakout — read on for levels, data, and trade signals. (155 characters) What is driving the recent XRP price move? XRP price surged after a wave of high-leverage long liquidations cleared crowded positions, enabling fresh buying interest. Strong volume spikes on October 3–4 and rising futures open interest suggest traders are increasing exposure, making the move higher dependent on sustained buyer conviction. How are futures traders influencing XRP price? Futures data shows accumulation: open interest and average position sizes have increased, which amplifies both breakout potential and downside risk. When open interest rises with volume, momentum is confirmed; if price stalls at resistance, the same leverage can accelerate liquidations. Source: on-chain data and exchange futures metrics (plain text). $XRP heats up near $3.10 resistance as futures traders load up. Will the breakout hold? $XRP price climbs after high leverage long liquidations, signaling fresh buying interest. Resistance lies between $3.05 and $3.12; while support zones hold between $2.85 and $2.20. Futures traders accumulate more, increasing the stakes for a breakout. $XRP bounced back hard after high-leverage liquidations shook the market. Now testing $3.10 resistance, its next move depends on strong volume and trader momentum as it eyes further gains amid growing buying pressure. Why did liquidations spark fresh momentum? The recent price jump in XRP price follows a wave of high-leverage long liquidations that removed crowded positions and triggered short-term capitulation. That selling created liquidity pools that larger buyers and market makers filled, producing a strong rebound. Heatmap and candlestick clusters show heavy volume around $2.90–$3.20, indicating active order zones. Source: CW Via X Price action between October 2 and 5 shows XRP fluctuating mostly between $2.85 and $3.20. A decisive close above $3.12 with follow-through volume would mark a technical breakout. Conversely, failure to sustain above $3.05–$3.12 increases the odds of a retest of $2.85 support. What are the immediate resistance and support levels? $XRP is encountering resistance at $3.05–$3.12 ; buyers have consistently defended $2.85–$2.90 and deeper support near $2.20–$2.40. A clean breakout needs sustained volume above resistance and reduced selling pressure at the highs. Key Levels — XRP Level Range Role Immediate Resistance $3.05–$3.12 Decision zone for breakout Near-term Support $2.85–$2.90 Buy-the-dip zone Secondary Support $2.20–$2.40 Lower boundary for buyers How should traders read volume and open interest? Volume surge accompanied by rising open interest typically confirms trend conviction. On October 3 a volume spike coincided with price strength, suggesting buyers were initiating fresh positions. If open interest falls while price rises, that can indicate short covering rather than new buyer conviction, weakening the breakout thesis. Source: CW Via X With futures trading picking up steam, XRP’s fate hinges on the resistance near $3.10 and support around $2.85. Traders must monitor volume, open interest, and liquidity clusters to anticipate whether the XRP breakout will sustain or reverse. Frequently Asked Questions What is the most likely XRP breakout scenario? If volume and open interest continue rising, the most likely scenario is a confirmed breakout above $3.12 with extension toward $3.40; failure to maintain momentum would see a pullback to $2.85–$2.90. (45 words) How quickly can liquidations change market direction? Liquidations can reverse short-term direction within hours, especially when leverage is high. A cascade of forced sells or covers can amplify moves; monitor leverage metrics and exchange funding rates to anticipate rapid swings. Key Takeaways Momentum source : Liquidations cleared positions and enabled buyers to push price higher. Decision zone : $3.05–$3.12 is the key resistance range to watch for an XRP breakout. Trade signal : Confirm breakout with rising volume and open interest; otherwise expect a retest of $2.85 support. Conclusion In summary, XRP price is testing a critical resistance area around $3.10 after a rebound from $2.85, driven by liquidations and increased futures activity. Monitor volume and open interest for confirmation of an XRP breakout, and prepare for higher volatility as traders size positions.

Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the UK’s Bank of England plans to grant waivers to certain firms, such as crypto exchanges that may need to hold large amounts of stablecoins for liquidity and settlement. The bank also intends to permit the use of stablecoins as settlement assets in its Digital Securities Sandbox, offering a controlled environment for testing blockchain-based issuance and trading. Britain’s Tougher Stance On Stablecoins Contrasts With US Rules The decision comes as industry voices raise concerns that the UK risks losing ground to the US , where the Trump administration’s GENIUS Act has already established rules around dollar-backed stablecoins. Market participants argue that Britain’s tougher posture could divert liquidity and innovation to New York instead of London. The Bank of England plans to grant exemptions to proposed limits on stablecoin holdings by businesses, indicating a softening stance toward cryptoassets amid growing competition from the US https://t.co/rCaBh2rYA4 — Bloomberg (@business) October 7, 2025 At the heart of the debate are ownership caps the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority have floated. Officials suggested limits of up to £20,000 for individuals and £10m for businesses on systemic stablecoins, those widely used for payments. A consultation paper expected by the end of the year will detail the proposed rules. Bailey’s Recent Comments Mark Shift From Earlier Skepticism Toward Stablecoins Governor Andrew Bailey has long been skeptical of stablecoins, warning earlier this year that they could erode public trust in money. He has spoken more favorably about tokenized bank deposits as a safer path. Yet, in recent weeks, Bailey has acknowledged that stablecoins may drive innovation and could co-exist with the traditional financial system. The shift matters because stablecoins are increasingly seen by banks and fintech firms as a faster, cheaper alternative to traditional payment rails. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates they could be used for more than $50 trillion in payments by 2030. Global circulation already exceeds $300b, but sterling-pegged tokens remain negligible at just $581,000, compared with $468m in euro-linked stablecoins, according to DefiLlama data. Industry executives say this imbalance shows the UK is falling behind. Industry Pressure Prompts Softer Approach To Stablecoin Regulation In Britain The Bank of England has acknowledged the pushback and is revising earlier plans. Officials are reportedly considering allowing systemic stablecoins to back some of their reserves with high-quality assets such as short-term government bonds. That would bring the rules closer to frameworks in the US and EU, easing some of the industry’s concerns. The Digital Securities Sandbox will also play a role in shaping the final approach. The pilot environment will permit firms to use regulated stablecoins tied to non-sterling currencies for settlement, giving regulators a chance to study their effectiveness in real-world use cases before finalizing wholesale rules. Stablecoins remain a small part of the UK market today, but their rapid global growth and the competition from overseas frameworks are forcing regulators to move faster. For the Bank of England, carving out exemptions may be the first step in balancing oversight with innovation.

BNB rally fueled by real on‑chain growth and Chainlink data integration Daily transactions climbed to 10–17 million, signalling organic adoption beyond speculation. Technical indicators (ADX 57, +DI above −DI) and social metrics (Social Dominance 2.67%) back continued momentum. BNB rally heats up: Binance Coin surges on-chain activity and Chainlink utility—read the latest analysis and short-term outlook. What is driving BNB’s recent rally to record highs? BNB rally is being driven by a sustained increase in BNB Chain on‑chain activity and the recent Chainlink integration that publishes official U.S. economic data on‑chain. This combination increased utility for DeFi and risk‑management apps and raised investor conviction, not just speculative flows. How strong is the on‑chain growth behind Binance Coin’s surge? Daily transactions on BNB Chain ranged between 10 and 17 million , marking one of the network’s most persistent growth windows. Developer activity and new smart‑contract deployments rose in tandem, indicating usage by real applications rather than short‑term trading bots. Chainlink integration propels BNB toward utility BNB Chain’s adoption of Chainlink’s data standard has enabled official U.S. economic feeds—GDP and the PCE Price Index—on the blockchain. That bridged macro data with smart contracts and opened new use cases in DeFi, prediction markets, and risk management. The integration enhances BNB Chain credibility and supports durable demand from projects requiring verifiable macro data. Sources: Chainlink data feeds (plain text), official metrics reported publicly (plain text). Will BNB bulls maintain control above support levels? BNB is trading above the $1,240 support zone and the 4‑hour structure shows ascending price action with consistent buying pressure. Technical indicators reinforced the bullish thesis: the DMI showed +DI above −DI , and the ADX at 57 signalled a strong directional trend. If momentum persists, a test of the $1,360 resistance becomes likely in the short term. Source: TradingView Rising optimism in sentiment and social buzz for BNB Santiment data recorded Binance Coin’s Social Dominance at 2.67% and Weighted Sentiment at 1.81 , the highest levels in months. The social uptick aligned with both the Chainlink announcement and higher BSC activity. Historically, sentiment spikes of this magnitude often precede extended rallies; combined with on‑chain growth, the data point toward sustained bullish bias. Source: Santiment Can network growth sustain this rally? Yes — current evidence points to sustainable drivers: organic transaction growth, developer engagement, and new on‑chain utility from Chainlink data feeds. These foundations reduce the risk that the rally is solely speculative. However, macro liquidity and broader crypto market trends remain relevant. Continued monitoring of on‑chain metrics and sentiment is necessary to confirm a multi‑month uptrend. How should traders and investors assess risk? Check on‑chain activity: sustained daily transactions and active addresses signal adoption. Monitor technical support: maintain stops below the $1,240 zone and track ADX and DMI for trend health. Watch sentiment and macro data: social dominance and Chainlink feed adoption indicate utility demand.

Official Chainlink economic data feeds and sustained network transaction growth triggered renewed demand, lifting BNB to fresh highs as utility use cases expanded. How should I set risk controls for BNB trades? Use a stop below the $1,240 support zone, size positions to account for volatility, and reassess stops if ADX and volume diverge from price action. Key Takeaways On‑chain growth matters : Persistent daily transactions (10–17M) point to real usage, not only speculation. Chainlink adds utility : Official macro feeds increase DeFi and risk‑management use cases on BNB Chain. Monitor technicals and sentiment : ADX, DMI, and social metrics should guide risk management and timing decisions. Conclusion BNB’s rally reflects a shift toward utility‑driven demand, supported by on‑chain adoption and Chainlink’s data integration. Continued monitoring of transaction volumes, technical indicators, and sentiment will determine whether this breakout matures into a longer‑term uptrend.

Canary filed final amendments adding 0.95% fees and tickers LTCC and HBR. Approval timing is uncertain due to the US government shutdown and limited SEC staffing. Fees exceed spot Bitcoin ETF averages (0.15–0.25%), but are typical for niche or newly ETF-ed assets. Canary Capital Litecoin and HBAR spot ETFs appear finalized but delayed by the US government shutdown — read fees and timing now. What is the current status of Canary Capital’s Litecoin and HBAR spot ETFs? Canary Capital Litecoin and HBAR spot ETFs show final amendments adding a 0.95% fee and the tickers LTCC and HBR, signals that filings are near completion. Approval is likely paused while the US government shutdown limits Securities and Exchange Commission operations, leaving precise launch timing unknown. How were the filings updated and what do the changes mean? Canary filed amendments on Tuesday that added a management fee of 0.95% and assigned tickers LTCC (Litecoin) and HBR (Hedera). Market analysts, including Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, view these changes as typical final updates prior to launch. Those amendments usually indicate readiness to list, but actual approval depends on the SEC resuming normal review processes. Publication and approval timelines are therefore in limbo while staffing and deadlines remain affected by the shutdown. Source: James Seyffart Why are the fees for these ETFs higher than spot Bitcoin ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs generally charge between 0.15% and 0.25% (source: Ledger). Canary’s 0.95% fee is higher, reflecting the premium often applied to newer, niche or less liquid assets when packaged as ETFs. Analyst Eric Balchunas noted that higher fees are “pretty normal” for emerging ETF product categories. If significant investor flows occur, competitors may introduce lower-fee alternatives to capture market share. How could the government shutdown affect ETF approvals? The US government shutdown, effective Oct. 1, reduced SEC staffing and left many pending ETF decisions unaddressed. The SEC indicated it would operate with a skeleton crew, but major approval actions are likely delayed until full operations resume. 16 crypto ETF decisions were anticipated in October; those deadlines now face uncertainty. New listing standards announced in September could accelerate approvals once the SEC can fully engage, but the immediate effect is a pause in final rulings. Are other issuers still filing ETFs during the shutdown? Yes. Analysts report numerous filings for leveraged and 3x offerings despite the shutdown. Issuers such as Tuttle Capital, GraniteShares, and ProShares (reportedly active in filings) have submitted batches of applications, some proposing 3x leverage via swaps and options. Source: Eric Balchunas What could ETF approvals mean for altcoins like LTC and HBAR? Analysts from Bitfinex predicted that altcoin-linked ETFs could broaden investor access and spur renewed rallies in the underlying tokens. ETF listings typically lower barriers for institutional and retail buyers, potentially increasing liquidity and visibility for Litecoin and Hedera. However, actual market impact depends on product uptake, fee levels, and competing issuer strategies. If flows are limited, price effects may be muted compared with the potential outcome of significant inflows.

Once the SEC returns to full staffing, approvals could proceed if filings remain unchanged. Analysts view Canary’s amendments as a sign of readiness, though final decisions depend on regulatory review and any further comments from the SEC. How do 3x ETF filings affect the market during a shutdown? Issuers continue filing 3x ETF applications because such products can be profitable; however, regulatory scrutiny over leverage and investor protection remains a major hurdle and approvals may be slower during reduced operations. Key Takeaways Filings near completion : Canary added 0.95% fees and tickers LTCC and HBR, typical final amendments. Approval delayed : The US government shutdown has paused many SEC actions, leaving launch timing uncertain. Market impact conditional : ETF listings could boost LTC and HBAR liquidity, but fees and investor flows will shape outcomes.

On one side are tokens leveraging artificial intelligence to power automation, analytics, and decentralized decision-making. On the other, memecoins, born from culture and community, are surging on sheer viral momentum. Both are attracting capital, attention, and speculation at record pace. Recent data from CoinMarketCap reveals that AI tokens have collectively reached over $34.4 billion in market cap this quarter, fueled by partnerships between AI firms and blockchain projects. Meanwhile, memecoins such as Dogecoin, Bonk, and Brett have posted double-digit weekly gains as social media sentiment spikes. The question for investors isn’t which narrative is louder, it’s which one will deliver the bigger returns as 2025 unfolds. And according to analysts, one project is bridging both narratives in real time, MAGACOIN FINANCE , a rising star that merges the cultural power of memes with the credibility of advanced blockchain design. The Rise of AI Cryptos AI cryptos have surged back into focus as generative intelligence reshapes global technology markets. Projects like ChainOpera AI , Fetch.ai , and SingularityNET are demonstrating how machine learning models can enhance on-chain data processing, predictive trading, and decentralized governance. ChainOpera AI, for instance, jumped over 600% in 24 hours after its listing on OrangeX, propelled by its dual appeal to tech developers and traders chasing the next data-driven edge. The momentum reflects a broader theme, investors are looking for tokens tied to real-world innovation rather than pure speculation. As more AI networks expand into DeFi, analytics, and gaming, these tokens are becoming the intellectual backbone of crypto, logical, scalable, and grounded in measurable performance. But logic doesn’t always drive markets, emotiondoes. And that’s where memecoins continue to win. The Power of Memecoins: Culture as Currency Memecoins remain the heartbeat of retail speculation. From Dogecoin’s Twitter-fueled rallies to Shiba Inu’s multi-billion-dollar rise, these assets have proven that cultural connection can outperform utility. Traders chase relatability, humor, community, and rebellion, more than whitepapers. This year alone, memecoin trading volumes have surpassed $24 billion , according to Kaiko Analytics, with Solana-based coins like Bonk and WIF leading the charge. Their simplicity and community-driven marketing make them easy to adopt and impossible to ignore. But with thousands of copycat projects flooding the market, differentiation is now the key to survival. Investors are searching for memecoins that combine viral power with actual structure – and MAGACOIN FINANCE has stepped in to define that category. The crypto market’s next defining clash is underway, artificial intelligence tokens versus meme-powered communities. AI cryptos are surging on real-world innovation and utility, but memecoins continue to dominate retail attention through pure viral energy. Between these two extremes, analysts say one project is bridging both worlds: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Combining cultural identity with a disciplined, data-backed structure, it’s carving a middle path between hype and fundamentals. Audited by CertiK and HashEx , MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers the credibility missing from most meme projects while maintaining the emotional resonance that fuels mass participation. Traders argue that while AI coins may bring long-term adoption, memecoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE can still deliver faster and larger ROI within each cycle. As narratives collide in 2025, the outcome may not be AI versus memes, but rather which project captures both intelligence and imagination in one unstoppable trend. How AI and Memecoins Represent Two Sides of the Same Market At first glance, AI cryptos and memecoins seem opposites: logic versus emotion, data versus memes, innovation versus chaos. But at their core, both express the same investor desire, participation in narratives that feel alive. AI projects offer intellectual engagement, investors buy into the idea of future technology disrupting finance. Memecoins offer emotional engagement, investors buy into communities that represent freedom and humor. Together, they form the yin and yang of crypto’s speculative psychology. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE prove that the next generation of winners won’t choose between structure and story. They’ll blend them. Its audited framework ensures it passes the legitimacy test, while its cultural branding ensures it captures public imagination. Market Outlook: Where the Next 50× Opportunities Lie Analysts from 10x Research and CryptoQuant agree: altcoin season 2025 will not be led by a single category . Instead, capital will oscillate between AI-driven projects, yield-based DeFi, and community-led memecoins. Liquidity from Bitcoin’s ETF boom will spill over into smaller tokens that can absorb volatility and amplify returns. For investors seeking 50× potential, the winning formula will include: Timing – entering before exchange listings. Credibility – verified audits and transparent tokenomics. Community – consistent, authentic engagement. By these standards, MAGACOIN FINANCE currently checks every box. It represents both sides of the market’s psychology, technical discipline for institutions and meme-driven hype for retail. The Final Word: Intelligence Meets Hype The 2025 crypto bull run won’t be a battle between AI and memes, it will be a convergence. The biggest winners will blend intelligence, humor, scarcity, and scale. As Bitcoin stabilizes and ETF liquidity expands, traders are migrating to assets that can deliver exponential returns while holding structural integrity. MAGACOIN FINANCE sits squarely in that crossfire, the first major project to channel both AI precision and meme virality into one movement. Whether 2025 becomes the year of AI or the year of memes, one thing is certain: projects capable of merging both will define the era. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading that charge.

Watch the $2.60–$3.15 range for decisive moves. Brandt warns a drop to $2.22 if XRP closes under $2.687. Descending triangle shows lower highs and horizontal support near $2.60.

Brandt sees XRP falling to $2.22 if it closes beneath $2.68743 and breaks triangle support. Descending triangle forms with lower highs and horizontal support near $2.60, signaling weakening demand. Analysts highlight resistance at $3.15 and a potential rally toward $3.60 if support holds. Veteran trader Peter Brandt released a fresh analysis on XRP that signals a possible steep decline. He states that XRP may fall to $2.22163 if it closes below $2.68743 . Brandt highlights a descending triangle pattern forming on the charts that suggests weakening demand. Brandt’s chart shows a series of lower highs paired with horizontal support near $2.60 . That structure hints that buyers are losing strength. He notes that XRP has repeatedly failed to hold above $3 despite multiple retests. The analyst’s warning arises from the risk that the support line breaks and accelerates selling pressure. What caused XRP to lose the No.3 market-cap spot? XRP’s market-cap drop followed a strong rally in BNB, which pushed Binance Coin above $1,300 and lifted its market capitalization to roughly $178 billion versus XRP’s $177 billion. The short-term shift reflects differential momentum between the tokens rather than a fundamental collapse in XRP’s network metrics. On the left is a classic descending triangle from Edwards and Magee, showing what descending triangles are supposed to do. On the right is a developing descending triangle. ONLY IF it closes below 2.68743 (then I’ll be a hater), then it should drop to 2.22163. $XRP pic.twitter.com/3GI7nT1TaW — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 7, 2025 Analyst CasiTrades offers a contrasting view. She observes that XRP has held the near-$3 region for several days and that momentum might build from here. She interprets the current consolidation as a setup for a strong upward wave. Her resistance targets are cited near $4 and $4.50 . How do on-chain signals and sentiment affect XRP’s outlook? Santiment reports a spike in FUD sentiment for XRP, which often precedes counterintuitive price moves. On-chain metrics show mixed signals: transfers and active addresses have not surged to match previous run-ups. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez says a breakout above $3.15 would likely trigger a rally toward $3.60 , making $3.15 a key test. Brandt’s outlook hinges on a close below $2.687 . A confirmed break would validate the descending triangle and increase the probability of a move to $2.22163 . Conversely, a rebound and clean break above resistance levels would shift market psychology back toward buyers. What are the practical trade levels and risk controls? Front-load risk levels: immediate support cluster sits between $2.60–$2.69 . Critical downside target: $2.22 . Key resistance levels: $3.15 , $3.60 , and psychological $4.00. Use stop-losses beneath $2.60 on long exposure and reduce size if price breaks and holds under $2.60. Frequently Asked Questions What is the probability of XRP falling to $2.22? Probability depends on a confirmed close below $2.687. If a daily close under that level occurs and the descending triangle momentum accelerates, downside toward $2.22 becomes likely; absent that close, odds favor range-bound behavior or a push to resistance. How should traders set stops around the triangle? Traders commonly place stops just below the triangle’s horizontal support—around $2.58–$2.60—using position sizing to limit loss to a defined percentage of capital. Confirm breakout direction before increasing exposure. Key Takeaways Immediate risk: A daily close below $2.687 could validate a descending triangle and target $2.22. Upside trigger: A clean breakout above $3.15 would likely push toward $3.60 and higher resistance zones. Market context: BNB’s recent surge shifted market-cap rankings; on-chain sentiment shows higher FUD for XRP. Conclusion This analysis shows clear bifurcated outcomes for XRP: a confirmed close under $2.687 makes a fall to $2.22 the most probable technical scenario, while a break above $3.15 would favor a rally toward $3.60 . Monitor the $2.60–$3.15 range and apply disciplined risk controls.

52824950,600542,1759892405,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Ethereum (ETH) Rises With Global Liquidity Expansion: Is $5,000 the Next Major Target?",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-eth-rises-global-liquidity-expansion-5000/,"Ethereum (ETH) continues to strengthen its bullish trajectory, rising above $4,700 as expanding global liquidity and institutional demand fuel optimism for a breakout toward $5,000. The world’s second-largest crypto asset is increasingly correlated with global M2 money supply growth, suggesting that macroeconomic liquidity injections are directly influencing crypto market performance. Ethereum Mirrors Global Liquidity Growth Recent analyses highlight Ethereum’s close relationship with global liquidity expansion, often measured by M2 money supply. As major central banks ease financial conditions and inject liquidity into markets, risk assets, including cryptocurrencies, have seen inflows. Ethereum , in particular, appears to benefit from this macro trend, reflecting a rise in investor confidence and institutional participation. Currently trading around $4,688, ETH has gained nearly 3% in the last 24 hours, showing resilience amid broader market volatility. Analysts point out that Ethereum’s ongoing accumulation phase between $4,300 and $4,700 suggests a re-accumulation setup ahead of a possible breakout. A decisive move above the $4,750–$4,800 resistance range could trigger a rally toward the $5,000–$5,500 zone. Institutional Confidence and Expanding Utility Ethereum’s fundamentals have strengthened alongside regulatory and institutional milestones. Grayscale recently secured approval for the first U.S.-listed spot staking ETPs, giving institutional investors access to Ethereum’s staking rewards through regulated products. Meanwhile, investment firm BitMine added $820 million worth of ETH to its treasury, a move analysts view as a major vote of confidence in Ethereum’s long-term potential. Nasdaq-listed SharpLink Gaming also announced $900 million in unrealized gains from its Ethereum-based financial strategy, confirming the token’s growing role as a productive asset rather than mere speculation. This wave of corporate and institutional participation reinforces Ethereum’s credibility as a yield-generating digital commodity, particularly as decentralized finance (DeFi) and Layer-2 ecosystems continue to expand. Technical Outlook: Eyes on $5,000 and Beyond Ethereum’s technical indicators support a bullish continuation, with the asset forming higher lows and holding above the 50-day moving average at $4,550. Analysts note that a clean breakout above $4,800 could open the path toward $5,000, with extended Fibonacci projections hinting at a possible move toward $7,300–$8,000 if global liquidity continues rising. However, traders remain cautious of mild overbought signals, as the RSI shows slight divergence. Short-term pullbacks toward $4,300–$4,050 would likely serve as re-accumulation zones before the next leg higher. Overall, Ethereum’s alignment with liquidity expansion, combined with record institutional interest, positions it as one of Q4’s strongest contenders to break the $5,000 mark.

Moreover, the early week prices for BTC reached an all-time high of around $125,800. Buying from institutions, inflows into exchange-traded funds, and macroeconomic uncertainty, including the US government shutdown, are contributing to the current momentum. According to the analysis, BTC may rise toward the $130,000 to $140,000 region and possibly $160,000 in the coming weeks. Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing strong momentum. The altcoin trades at $4,300–$4,540 and could soon break above $5,000. Away from these two blue-chip coins, Investors have identified MAGACOIN FINANCE as an alternative asset that yields high returns. Similar to BTC and ETH, factors such as adoption growth, community sentiment, and market dynamics are driving the robust outlook of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Bitcoin (BTC): Historic Highs and Institutional Support BTC’s recent all-time high at $125,800 is supported by: Institutional inflows and ETF-driven investment Macroeconomic uncertainty, including the US government shutdown Breakout from a descending channel fueling bullish momentum Analysts anticipate that BTC may reach $130K–$140K in the near term, with some forecasts extending to $160K within 12 weeks if momentum persists. Ethereum (ETH): Technical Momentum and Institutional Interest ETH trades near $4,300–$4,540 , with a breakout above $5,000 possible in October 2025. Key drivers include: Fusaka network upgrade Layer-2 adoption growth Institutional investment from major players like BlackRock Technical analysis shows a symmetrical triangle , suggesting consolidation before a potential rally. Price targets over the next 6–12 months range from $5,000 to $5,500 , highlighting ETH’s continued role as a leading innovative contract platform and central hub for DeFi and NFT ecosystems. MAGACOIN FINANCE: High-Up Potential While Bitcoin dominates headlines, the conversation around MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly intensifying. Analysts across major trading desks and retail communities are identifying it as one of the few projects with credible 50x potential going into the next bull cycle. Its scarcity-driven model and focus on verifiable, compliant fundraising have given it significant traction among serious investors. Analysts describe it as one of the top altcoins to buy today . As capital flows from high-cap assets like Bitcoin into undervalued presales, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are positioned to capture investor rotation. Many market commentators view it as the top early-stage opportunity of 2025 , much like Solana and Avalanche did in their own previous cycles. Market Outlook According to new reports, Q4 2025 is expected to favour long-standing cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH, as well as higher-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Institutional inflows, technical setups and adoption metrics drive rotation strategies. Investors aiming for accessibility and high growth potential are in all likelihood, positioning across these assets. This quarter of the year presents an opportunity for well-rounded exposure to a variety of altcoins, as BTC reaches all-time highs, ETH undergoes technical consolidation, and MAGACOIN FINANCE experiences rapid adoption. Conclusion Bitcoin consolidates around $125,500 and may rise to $ 130K–$140K. The technical strength of Ethereum, currently around $ 4,300-$ 4,540, will trigger a push above US$5,000, according to analysts. Furthermore, the new cryptocurrency MAGACOIN FINANCE shows potential for a high upside. With verified smart contracts publicly available on Hashex.org , MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to earn a reputation as a safe and legitimate presale trusted by analysts. The strong fundamentals indicate that it can achieve significant momentum through adoption and community engagement. Combining these assets yields a strong portfolio of top market performers and emerging high-growth altcoins for Q4 2025.

The altcoin has consistently failed to breach its nearest resistance level at $3, resulting in a retracement to crucial support levels that are vital for preventing a significant correction and further declines. XRP Price Struggles As Bitcoin Hits New High While Bitcoin (BTC) recently celebrated a new all-time high above $126,000, Ethereum (ETH) is inching closer to its own record of $4,900, and Binance Coin (BNB) mirrors Bitcoin’s ascent with prices rising above $1,300, XRP has faced a nearly 4% drop. Related Reading: Is A $10,000 Ethereum Price Within Reach? Here’s What Experts Are Forecasting Next Market expert Lark Davis expressed his concern on social media site X (formerly Twitter), stating that the XRP price has been unable to find its footing, repeatedly getting pushed down in its attempts to break the descending resistance line. He emphasized that a successful break above the orange line just above the current trading price could open the door to a target of $4, which would mean a new all-time high for the XRP price. However, Davis cautioned that failure to achieve this could necessitate reliance on the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2.94. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.92, just below this critical level, further accentuating the lack of bullish momentum. A sustained drop below this point could lead to further declines toward nearby support levels, with $2.77 emerging as a significant threshold on the daily chart. The $2.60 mark also becomes increasingly important. Should this level be tested, it could prevent a major collapse toward $2.22, a pivotal consolidation point since June that preceded XRP’s surge to over $3.60 in July. On the contrary, if this support breaks, the $2 mark could be in jeopardy for the remainder of the year. Can Consolidation Lead To A Breakout? Despite these challenges, some analysts remain optimistic about the XRP price prospects. Egrag Crypto, a market analyst recognized for bullish forecasts on the altcoin, shared an encouraging outlook on social media. He highlighted the potential for an October breakout, based on mathematical projections and historical breakout percentages. Egrag pointed out that an ascending triangle typically breaks out around the 70-80% mark of its formation. According to his analysis, if the XRP price continues to consolidate within this triangle pattern between $2.6 and $3.6, traders can anticipate a breakout as it approaches 70% to 80% of its formation.

Currently, XRP has slipped to the fourth spot, having been overtaken by Binance Coin. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether the XRP price can overcome its challenges and regain momentum in this competitive landscape.

Bill Zanker, a longtime Trump associate and promoter, is leading the effort through Fight Fight Fight LLC. Funding ambitions could reportedly climb to as much as $1b, although the effort remains ongoing and may not ultimately be completed. Zanker’s latest attempt to shore up the Trump coin comes after its steep drop from $44 in January to about $8 today. Clash With World Liberty Financial Derailed Wallet Initiative Plans for the digital-asset treasury, or DAT, follow a wave of similar vehicles launched this year. PitchBook data shows more than 80 companies have entered the space in 2025, many of which saw valuations slip after an early burst of excitement. According to Bloomberg, Fight Fight Fight LLC, issuer of the TRUMP token, plans to raise at least $200 million to establish a Digital Asset Treasury (DAT) for accumulating the struggling “Trump memecoin.” The company is run by Donald Trump’s longtime associate Bill Zanker, and… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) October 8, 2025 Trump himself has lent visibility to the project. In May, he attended a dinner with top holders of the meme coin . Before the event, Fight Fight Fight promoted a contest on social media. A scoreboard tracked leading investors who would qualify for a seat at the table. Later in the summer, Zanker’s plan for a Trump-branded wallet collapsed. The setback followed a clash with another Trump-linked crypto venture, World Liberty Financial. Meanwhile, that firm’s WLFI token has already drawn interest from ALT5 Sigma, a separate digital-asset treasury company. Majority Of Tokens Held By Trump-Linked Entities Unlocking Gradually The Trump token’s supply remains tightly controlled. According to Messari, only about 35% is unlocked, giving the token a circulating market value of roughly $1.5b. Meanwhile, the rest, mostly held by Trump-linked entities, continues to unlock gradually. The total supply is capped at 1b tokens, with 800m locked at launch. In addition, crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun ranks among the largest holders. Sun, who also advises World Liberty Financial, attended the May dinner and received a watch. Struggling Token Spurs Zanker To Seek Fresh Investor Support Zanker’s fundraising drive comes as the Trump family expands its involvement in digital assets. Over the past year, it has launched ventures in Bitcoin mining, a stablecoin project, a treasury strategy, and exchange-traded funds tied to the world’s largest cryptocurrency. For Zanker, the treasury plan is an attempt to revive momentum in a token that has struggled to keep investor confidence.

ETH is now consolidating and might struggle to rise above $4,600 in the short term. Ethereum started a downside correction below $4,620 and $4,600. The price is trading below $4,600 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $4,560 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could continue to move down if it trades below $4,420. Ethereum Price Corrects Gains Ethereum price extended gains above $4,600 and $4,620, like Bitcoin . ETH price even tested the $4,750 resistance zone before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $4,759 and the price corrected some gains. There was a move below the $4,620 and $4,600 levels. Besides, there was a break below a key bullish trend line with support at $4,560 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The pair even tested the $4,440 zone and is currently consolidating losses. Ethereum price is now trading below $4,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $4,520 level and the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,759 swing high to the $4,435 low. The next key resistance is near the $4,550 level. The first major resistance is near the $4,600 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $4,759 swing high to the $4,435 low. A clear move above the $4,600 resistance might send the price toward the $4,650 resistance. An upside break above the $4,650 region might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $4,720 resistance zone or even $4,750 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $4,600 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $4,440 level. The first major support sits near the $4,420 zone. A clear move below the $4,420 support might push the price toward the $4,320 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $4,250 region in the near term.

The crypto market cooled after last week’s rally, with top coins experiencing sharp but mostly orderly pullbacks. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana each slipped from historic peaks as traders booked profits, while technical resistance and ETF-driven buying remained focal points. The mood, however, remains constructive, with analysts noting strong inflows into ETFs, high institutional demand, and solid support at new, higher bases. Bitcoin dips below $121K BTC hit a new all-time high above $126,000 before settling near $121,991—a roughly 2% daily loss on the session shown. This pullback follows a week fueled by spot ETF inflows ($3.2B last week alone) and hedging around US government shutdown risks, both cited as key rally drivers. According to industry analysts, some cooling was inevitable as the rally “got overheated” and momentum traders locked in gains. Yet, institutional demand remains strong, and observers believe structural support—like spot ETF participation—should limit further downside. Ethereum (ETH) below $4,500 Ethereum traded at about $4,477, off 4.5% for the day and underperforming BTC in the pullback, although it posted an impressive 7.8% gain over the past week. ETH shadowed BTC’s trajectory, lifting on ETF inflows and institutional treasury demand before profit-taking set in. Ethereum investment products attracted $1.48 billion in net inflows last week, pushing total inflows for 2025 to $13.7 billion — nearly three times last year’s tally, according to CoinShares. The surge was largely driven by US spot Ethereum ETFs, which accounted for $1.3 billion of the total. ETH briefly touched a three-week high of $4,755 before easing in early Asian trade on Tuesday, though profit-taking remained limited compared with earlier rallies. The restrained selling suggests traders remain confident about the continuation of the broader uptrend. Technically, the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) around $4,100 is the immediate level to watch. A sustained break below it could expose the 100-day SMA, a key support zone that cushioned major pullbacks in June and September. Solana (SOL) down 5% Solana drifted down to $221.66 after a stellar run up to $240 this week, losing about 5% on the day but still outpacing the broader crypto market over the past month. Solana’s pullback comes after robust revenue generation ($2.85B over 12 months) and structural network improvements, including plans for a major speed-boosting overhaul. October’s ETF spotlight may give SOL the momentum it needs to enter price discovery, as key deadlines for spot Solana ETF applications approach this week. XRP crashes 4% XRP traded at $2.87, down nearly 4% on the day but up over 1% this week. XRP climbed above $3 earlier before stalling at the resistance $3.07, encountering heavy profit-taking by institutional wallets. XRP’s volatility is closely tied to ongoing ETF application headlines, with several spot ETF decisions scheduled for mid- to late October. Analysts say a sustained break above $3.10–$3.30 could trigger a move to $4.00–$4.20 if ETF catalysts deliver as expected. Fundamental sentiment remains split, with bearish retail traders but continued accumulation near $3, suggesting a contrarian setup. Top gainers and losers Among the day’s outperformers, PancakeSwap (CAKE) led the rally with a 14% surge, supported by rising trading volumes and renewed activity in decentralised exchanges. Sonic (S) advanced 9%, extending its recent momentum, while BNB gained 5% to emerge as the strongest performer among the major cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, DoubleZero (ZZ) slumped 17%, marking the steepest decline of the session. Plasma (XPL) dropped 13%, extending its recent slide, while Zcash (ZEC), MYX Finance (MYX), and Ethena (ENA) also traded sharply lower as investors rotated out of smaller, higher-risk tokens amid fading appetite for speculative trades.

Many of those early buyers made over 1000% profits when ETH moved from a few dollars to four figures. Now, those same traders are looking for a new project that can repeat such a breakout. The market is full of options, but only a few have real utility and clear growth logic. One of those projects now turning heads is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . From early ETH wins to the next DeFi target The presale is in Phase 6, and momentum is building fast. The current price is $0.035, and over 60% of the tokens in this phase have already been sold. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised about $16.88 million, and the next phase will increase the token price by 15% to $0.040. With more than 16,800 holders, the community is growing quickly. The total supply is 4 billion tokens, setting a solid foundation for long-term scalability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up as a strong contender for the next DeFi boom. It is building a complete lending and borrowing network that connects liquidity providers and borrowers directly on-chain. Users will be able to deposit stablecoins or popular assets like ETH and receive mtTokens in return. These mtTokens will represent their share in liquidity pools and will earn rewards over time. Borrowers will use supported assets as collateral to access instant loans with clear limits and automatic liquidation rules. This system will make lending safer and more predictable, which is why experienced investors are watching closely. The project’s focus on transparency and control gives it an edge in today’s volatile market. Why smart money is moving toward MUTM, road to $3 Analysts studying the crypto fear and greed index believe traders are shifting from large caps like Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) toward newer DeFi tokens with stronger utility. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) fits that strategy perfectly. It combines working token mechanics with long-term reward systems that build value for both users and holders. One of the key drivers will be the buy-and-distribute system. The platform will use a share of its protocol revenue to buy MUTM tokens from the open market. These tokens will then be distributed to mtToken stakers as rewards. This means every new transaction on the platform will help create real demand for the token. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also plans to launch a beta version before its exchange debut. This version will allow users to test the main features, such as lending, borrowing, and reward tracking. It will give early adopters hands-on experience and help the project gain real community traction before listing. The platform’s roadmap shows clear plans for listings on major exchanges like KuCoin and MEXC. These listings will make the token easier to trade and increase liquidity once the project goes live. More access means more visibility — and that usually means more volume from both retail and institutional buyers. An early investor from Phase 2, who joined at $0.015, is already up 130% on paper. Analysts expect that value to grow even more as the project reaches its expected listing price of $0.06 and later targets $3 by 2026. For many traders, that represents an opportunity larger than Solana (SOL)’s last major run. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also include automatic buybacks using platform revenue, which means continued buying pressure long after launch. Combined with a growing user base and institutional interest, this creates a natural upward cycle. The project’s CertiK audit confirms its technical reliability. With a $50,000 bug bounty and a $100,000 giveaway, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is showing that it values community safety and engagement. These programs will build more confidence before the mainnet goes live. This approach feels familiar to investors who are already used to investing in BTC, but it’s smarter. It has the same benefits as loan protocols like AAVE or COMP, but its mtToken mechanism gives users more power and aligns rewards. Long-term investors of Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL) are secretly buying MUTM while the price is still low, under one dollar. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also benefits from the larger market cycle. When BTC stabilizes and big currencies slow down, liquidity generally transfers toward smaller, potential initiatives. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is ready to take advantage of that flow thanks to how it works, how it rewards users, and how it is available on exchanges. The presale is now more than halfway over, so anyone who wants to get in early doesn’t have much time. When Phase 7 starts, the cost of entry will go up again, and demand will be considerably higher.

This massive accumulation cements BitMine as one of the largest corporate Ethereum holders on record and signals a decisive institutional shift toward altcoins. According to the company’s latest investor update, BitMine’s crypto strategy now represents more than 2% of Ethereum’s circulating supply , with ambitions to reach 5% over the coming years. The firm’s statement called this phase the “Alchemy of 5%,” underscoring its intention to mirror Bitcoin-style corporate accumulation, but within the Ethereum ecosystem. The move has sparked intense discussion across the industry. If Bitcoin was the first institutional gateway, analysts now believe Ethereum’s growing corporate demand could trigger a new multi-trillion-dollar phase of altcoin adoption. Institutional Ethereum Accumulation Reaches Historic Scale BitMine’s $13 billion portfolio is the latest proof that Ethereum’s investment narrative has shifted from speculative to structural. Unlike early-cycle buyers chasing momentum, institutional entities like BitMine are accumulating ETH as long-term strategic assets, hedging against monetary debasement and positioning for blockchain’s infrastructure future. The company’s portfolio includes unencumbered cash of $456 million and diversified crypto holdings across multiple ecosystems, signaling deep liquidity management. Daily trading volumes of $2.5 billion in BitMine’s BMNR stock make it one of the most active equity proxies for crypto exposure in U.S. markets. Market strategists at Bloomberg Intelligence argue that BitMine’s accumulation could reshape on-chain liquidity dynamics. With such a large portion of Ethereum held off-exchange, available supply is tightening. Historically, such scarcity precedes multi-quarter rallies, particularly when paired with rising institutional interest. This development could spark the same “ETF-style” ripple effect we saw in Bitcoin earlier this year, but this time, it’s altcoins that may capture the overflow. Altcoin Market Implications: Liquidity Flows and Scarcity Effects Ethereum sits at the heart of the broader altcoin ecosystem. When institutional confidence in ETH increases, it cascades across the entire market, from Layer 2 scaling solutions to DeFi and AI-integrated projects. According to CoinShares, Ethereum-based products have recorded five consecutive weeks of positive inflows , reversing last year’s trend of outflows. As ETH regains its leadership role in decentralized infrastructure, capital is likely to flow into correlated assets such as Solana, Polygon, and Avalanche. But the real beneficiaries could be emerging tokens , projects that offer narrative strength and verifiable structure. Analysts are already naming MAGACOIN FINANCE among those poised to capitalize. With a proven presale track record and strong audit credentials, it’s positioned to absorb speculative inflows as Ethereum’s rally matures. BitMine’s staggering $13 billion Ethereum holdings highlight how institutions are solidifying long-term positions in large-cap cryptos. But retail investors are increasingly seeking asymmetric setups, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as their chosen high-beta counterpart. Its current presale price of $0.00051213 and $0.007 listing target signal a 13.6× upside gap before trading begins, offering a clear entry point for those seeking pre-market acceleration. Audited by CertiK and HashEx , the project has quickly built a reputation for reliability amid the meme-token sector’s volatility. Analysts forecast 35×–45× growth potential through 2026 if listing liquidity aligns with current participation trends. While institutional whales accumulate stability, retail traders are turning to precision-engineered volatility – and MAGACOIN FINANCE has positioned itself at the very heart of that movement. The New Altcoin Cycle: Institutional Meets Retail The crypto market is now defined by a rare alignment of forces. Institutions like BitMine are anchoring long-term liquidity into Ethereum, while retail traders are chasing new opportunities outside the top ten. Together, they’re constructing a layered ecosystem of conviction and speculation that drives exponential value creation. Ethereum’s growing role as an institutional reserve asset may lead to a domino effect: Increased staking demand tightens available float. Layer 2 expansion enhances on-chain scalability and usability. Altcoin spillover accelerates as liquidity rotates outward. This multi-tier structure is what analysts call the “Wealth Cascade”, a cycle where capital trickles down from institutional holdings into retail speculation, multiplying market capitalization across all layers of the ecosystem. In that model, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE occupy the exact sweet spot between retail excitement and credible structure. Risks and Timing Considerations While the bullish case is strong, investors must remain mindful of short-term volatility. If Ethereum’s price consolidates following BitMine’s disclosure, the market could experience a temporary cooldown. Historically, such pauses have provided ideal accumulation windows before secondary rallies. Key metrics to watch include: Exchange outflows : Rising ETH withdrawals suggest continued accumulation. Staking deposits : Growth indicates strengthening long-term conviction. Altcoin total market cap dominance : Increases confirm rotation into smaller assets. For speculative plays like MAGACOIN FINANCE, early entry remains critical. Once exchange listings begin and liquidity floods in, the potential for exponential returns typically diminishes. Conclusion: The Start of a New Institutional Altcoin Era BitMine’s $13 billion Ethereum position is more than a corporate milestone – it’s a statement of intent. It marks the institutional arrival of Ethereum as a core financial asset and sets the stage for altcoins to thrive in its orbit. As on-chain liquidity tightens, the ripple effect will be felt across every sector of the market. For investors seeking strategic exposure, Ethereum offers the foundation. But for those looking for asymmetric upside, the kind that defines new wealth cycle, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as the breakout candidate. It represents the next evolutionary layer of this market: transparent, deflationary, and fueled by social conviction. The institutional era of altcoins has begun, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is already writing its first chapter.

Analysts whisper that a new DeFi project is pulling smart money away from older coins and into something fresh with real utility. With rising attention on crypto prices today and talks of new crypto ETF approvals, investors are looking for the next early-stage gem before the next wave of market enthusiasm hits. Insiders are already calling Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the top name to watch—an emerging DeFi platform that blends lending, stablecoins, and staking into one smart ecosystem. Many believe this is the last entry window before the next 15% jump. A presale that’s moving fast The presale of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in full swing, and the numbers are getting attention across the market. Phase 6 is live at $0.035 per token, with more than $16.88 million raised so far and over 16,800 holders. Around 60% of the 170 million tokens in this round are already claimed, leaving only 40% still available before the price rises to $0.04 in Phase 7. That next phase marks a 15% increase, creating what traders are calling the FOMO moment of 2025. This rapid progress has also positioned Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as one of the most discussed upcoming DeFi launches this year. Investors are finding confidence in its transparent approach, smart audit partnerships, and a growing reputation for designing a stable yet high-yield platform. The future of DeFi lending is forming Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a two-way lending system designed to work for both safe and adventurous investors. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system allows lenders to supply liquidity to audited pools in major tokens like ETH and USDT. Yields adjust automatically depending on how much of the pool is being used—higher utilization means higher returns. For those seeking more flexibility, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending will let users create direct agreements around riskier or newer assets. Each loan remains over-collateralized, and borrowers receive mtTokens that represent their deposits and track their earnings. When market prices shift, an automatic liquidation system will protect liquidity by selling collateral before losses build up. This structure will make borrowing simple while keeping lenders safe. At the center of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its stablecoin innovation, which will link the ecosystem together. The platform is creating a stablecoin pegged to $1, governed by the protocol itself. It will only be minted when users borrow against their assets and will be burned when those loans are repaid. Every loan will be over-collateralized, and the system will use a flexible interest policy to keep the peg steady—raising rates when the price falls below $1 and lowering them when it goes above. Arbitrage between the stablecoin and other markets will keep everything in balance. This innovation is expected to make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) one of the most sustainable and liquid DeFi systems in development. It aims to attract both everyday traders and professional liquidity providers looking for steady returns in an industry often known for volatility. Chainlink oracles Accurate price tracking will be critical to this model, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is integrating Chainlink oracles to guarantee reliable valuations. Backup feeds and time-weighted price averages from decentralized exchanges will add more data points, ensuring fairness in every loan and liquidation. This multi-layered system will protect against manipulation and improve transparency across the platform. To reward users even more, the protocol will feature mtToken staking. Users of mtTokens—earned by lending into pools—can stake them to receive MUTM rewards. Platform revenue will be used for open-market buybacks of MUTM tokens, which will then be distributed to stakers. This buy-and-reward loop is expected to keep user participation high and create a consistent reward cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has followed a clear roadmap from the start. Its development phases outline everything from early presale stages to final launch: building the smart contracts, creating the dashboard, and preparing for audits. Security remains central to Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s credibility. The project’s CertiK audit reported a TokenScan Score of 90 and a Skynet Score of 79, both reflecting high technical quality. Alongside this, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched a $50,000 bug bounty program with rewards up to $2,000 for critical findings, and a $100,000 community giveaway to reward early supporters. These incentives show a clear focus on both safety and community growth. The countdown to phase 7 There is just 40% of Phase 6’s allocation left, and investors are rushing to get their portion before the price goes up. People are saying that the present level of $0.035 is only a brief stop before the 15% rise to $0.04. For people who buy early, this brief window offers not only a discount, but also a chance to get in on what analysts think will be a top DeFi project in 2026. Today, crypto prices are going up and down between fear and recovery. The interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) illustrates that investors still want businesses with genuine systems and long-term profitability. As the next presale phase gets closer and enthusiasm grows, experts say that the smart money is already moving, and MUTM is the name that is leading the way.

U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $1.18 billion in inflows on Monday — the second-largest daily inflow since launch. The surge in demand came as BTC touched a new all-time high near $126,000, reflecting renewed investor enthusiasm and institutional confidence. So far this month, inflows have totaled $3.47 billion in just the first four trading days of October, pushing total assets across U.S. Bitcoin ETFs close to $60 billion.

Gold Rally Strengthens Long-Term Outlook As gold prices surpassed $4,000 per ounce, analysts at VanEck projected Bitcoin could eventually hit $644,000 if it captures even half of gold’s market value by the 2028 halving. The comparison reflects a deepening belief that Bitcoin now functions as a digital version of gold — scarce, portable, and increasingly used as a hedge against inflation. JUST IN: $130 billion VanEck’s Matthew Sigel says, “ #Bitcoin should reach half of gold’s market cap after the next halving.” That’s “$644,000 per BTC” pic.twitter.com/cgsgYkrHTG — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 7, 2025 Rising tariffs, a weakening U.S. dollar, and global uncertainty continue to drive capital into hard assets like gold and Bitcoin. Many younger investors, particularly in emerging markets, now view Bitcoin as the superior store of value, signaling a generational shift away from traditional safe havens. This growing alignment between gold and Bitcoin suggests that as institutional adoption accelerates, both assets could rise in tandem, reinforcing BTC’s reputation as a digital counterpart to precious metals. Bitcoin Technical Analysis: Bullish Setup Holds On the technical front , Bitcoin remains in a strong uptrend despite short-term pullbacks. Price action is supported by both the 50-day simple moving average (around $120,462) and the 100-day SMA ($116,215), confirming that the structure remains intact. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview The chart shows a Bearish Butterfly harmonic pattern nearing its Potential Reversal Zone (PRZ) between $128,000 and $130,000, where temporary resistance may appear. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has cooled to around 48, suggesting healthy consolidation after prior overbought readings. If Bitcoin maintains support above $121,700, it could retest $126,200 and move toward $130,000. A confirmed breakout above this range would invalidate the bearish setup and potentially open a path to $160,000 in the coming months. Record $1.18B ETF inflows spark renewed momentum as BTC consolidates near $122K. Structure remains bullish with targets at $128K–$130K, and a breakout could open a path toward $160K. Institutional demand shows no signs of slowing. #BTC #Crypto pic.twitter.com/SKbX9DgiBh — Arslan Ali (@forex_arslan) October 8, 2025 Overall, Bitcoin’s price action points to strength, not fatigue. With record ETF inflows, institutional participation, and macro tailwinds converging, BTC’s current consolidation may simply be the calm before its next major rally.

A volume spike almost seven times the daily average confirmed liquidation flows, with price stabilizing only after touching $2.878 support. Traders now eye whether the $2.85–$2.87 band can hold ahead of Ripple’s banking charter review deadline. News Background Ripple’s push for a U.S. national banking charter has drawn scrutiny from regulators, with the Oct. 7 OCC deadline marking a key moment in the review. Global macro remains a drag: trade disputes and diverging central bank policy continue to sap FX and crypto liquidity, a headwind for enterprise-facing tokens like XRP. On Binance, custody reserves rose ~19% over the week, suggesting distribution pressure even as some whale accumulation continues on-chain. Price Action Summary Resistance: $2.993 confirmed as ceiling after repeated rejections on high volume. Breakdown: The heaviest decline occurred between 13:00–15:00 UTC, as volumes exploded to 586.9M and price collapsed to $2.878. Range: 24-hour span covered $0.144 (4.8%) — wider than recent sessions, underscoring fragile order books. Recovery: Final hour bounce from $2.858 to $2.881 (+0.8%) reflected short-term stabilization as algos exploited thin liquidity. Technical Analysis Resistance: $2.99–$3.00 remains firm ceiling. Support: $2.85–$2.87 band is key; failure opens path toward $2.70. Volume: 7x daily average on liquidation flows highlights institutional exit pressure. Trend: Lower highs under $3.00 — bearish bias until reversal signals emerge. Momentum: Small recovery late in session suggests short-term stabilization, but broader setup stays fragile.

This historic surge has not only reaffirmed investor trust in Bitcoin but also reignited interest in the broader DeFi sector. As liquidity floods back into the market, attention is shifting from Bitcoin’s dominance to smaller, high-upside tokens that can outperform in the coming months. Among these rising projects, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has become the quiet star analysts are calling “the next-generation DeFi lender.” While Bitcoin’s ETF news dominates headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting smart investors looking for something beyond Bitcoin’s slower gains — a DeFi opportunity with a clear structure, real utility, and measurable growth targets. BTC ETFs record Spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded a record $5 billion trading volume in a single day, signaling surging institutional activity. In that same session, net ETF inflows hit about $676 million, with BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust pulling in $405 million and Fidelity acquiring 1,570 BTC (~$179 million). Bitcoin’s price jumped past $120,000 as the inflows fueled momentum. The spike underscores how heavily institutional demand now influences BTC’s price action, with ETF volume becoming a major driver. Investors eye MUTM as presale nears phase 7 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Presale Phase 6 at a price of $0.035 per token. With over $16.88 million raised, 16,800 holders, and around 60% of this phase already sold, demand is climbing quickly. Only about 40% of Phase 6 tokens remain before the price automatically jumps 15% to $0.04 in Phase 7. The presale has a clear design for steady growth — from $0.01 in Phase 1 to $0.06 in Phase 11, offering consistent gains to early buyers. As one analyst put it, “early participants are buying at a discount before the testnet launch news drops.” The project’s growth path, paired with its DeFi fundamentals, makes this stage look like a rare early entry point. Dual lending architecture brings DeFi to everyone The first reason analysts call Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the crypto of the week lies in its dual lending architecture, which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. The P2C model will let users deposit assets such as USDT or BTC into smart contracts that automatically lend to approved borrowers. The system adjusts interest rates based on liquidity use — when most funds are lent out, rates rise to attract more deposits. In contrast, the P2P option will serve users who prefer direct deals on less liquid tokens, offering higher returns for taking on more risk. Every lender receives mtTokens, digital receipts that represent their share in the pool and track both the principal and earned interest. This creates a transparent and efficient way to measure earnings while keeping funds flexible. The result is a lending ecosystem built for both large investors and everyday users — all while maintaining decentralized transparency. Stablecoin framework designed for long-term stability Another core strength of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its stablecoin framework, which focuses on maintaining a strong $1 peg even during market volatility. Each stablecoin will be minted only when users borrow against collateral, and every loan will remain overcollateralized. This ensures that every issued unit of the stablecoin is backed by more value than it represents. The system’s design prevents oversupply by allowing only approved issuers to mint new tokens within defined caps. When borrowers repay their loans, the borrowed stablecoins are automatically burned, reducing supply. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s governance model will control the stablecoin’s interest rates to keep its value steady, raising rates when prices fall below $1 and lowering them when prices rise above. Arbitrage traders will help maintain the peg by buying or selling the stablecoin whenever small deviations occur. This entire process creates a self-balancing system that keeps the ecosystem stable. It’s a structure that builds confidence among lenders, borrowers, and future DeFi partners who may integrate with Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s lending pools. Reward system that encourages holding Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also introduces a staking and buyback system that rewards users and supports long-term token value. When users stake their mtTokens, they will earn MUTM rewards funded by the platform’s operational revenue. Meanwhile, part of that revenue will be used for open-market buybacks of MUTM, creating steady demand and supporting price growth. The team is also developing an interactive dashboard where users will track their earnings, holdings, and projected ROI. A Top 50 leaderboard will recognize the biggest contributors with bonus MUTM rewards, giving the ecosystem a fun, gamified layer that encourages community engagement and friendly competition. The real story behind the headlines Bitcoin’s $5 billion crypto ETF volume has gotten people excited all over again, but the next big news story might not be about BTC itself. It might be Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi project that has actual mechanics and a good roadmap that is getting a lot of interest from investors. The countdown has officially begun, and there are just 40% of the Phase 6 tokens left before the price goes up to $0.04. Analysts think that this week might be the time when Mutuum Finance (MUTM) advances from an early-stage presale to the next big name in crypto news. This is because money is still moving from BTC to DeFi.

What it does: Creates a supervised, time‑limited testing regime for on‑chain projects. Why it matters: Aims to replace ad hoc enforcement with clear, predictable rules and bring more innovation onshore. Timing and scope: Chair Paul Atkins said the proposal could be finalized before year‑end; scope includes DeFi, tokenization, and payments. Meta description: SEC innovation exemption could let crypto projects test on-chain products under supervision — learn what it means and how to prepare. What is the SEC innovation exemption? The SEC innovation exemption is a conditional exemptive relief framework proposed to allow crypto and fintech startups to pilot products on‑chain under formal regulatory supervision for a limited time. It aims to provide a clear, temporary path for compliant experimentation while comprehensive rulemaking is developed. How would the innovation exemption work in practice? The framework would permit eligible projects to request conditional relief that defines operational limits, disclosure requirements, investor protections, and reporting to SEC staff. Projects accepted into the program would operate under supervision—allowing regulators to observe live deployments and collect data, while firms test use cases without immediate enforcement risk. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""SEC Innovation Exemption Could Let Crypto Projects Test On‑Chain Under Supervision"", ""description"": ""The SEC is developing a conditional relief framework—an innovation exemption—to let crypto and fintech projects operate temporarily under agency supervision while broader rulemaking is finalized."", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/images/logo.png"" } }, ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-08T09:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-08T09:00:00Z"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/sec-innovation-exemption"" }, ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/images/sec-innovation-exemption.jpg"", ""wordCount"": ""714""} Why is the SEC proposing an innovation exemption? Chair Paul Atkins framed the innovation exemption as a corrective to years of what industry figures called “regulation by enforcement,” which pushed activity offshore. The goal is to strike a balance between investor protection and technological progress by giving regulators a chance to see real‑world implementations before finalizing rules. Who supports and who warns about the plan? Industry leaders like Jakob Kronbichler (Clearpool) and Wendy Fu (Momentum Finance) welcomed a supervised testing option, saying it lowers the barrier to responsible experimentation. Critics caution the exemption will only be meaningful if conditions reflect how distributed systems actually operate and remain affordable for startups. When could projects expect the framework to be available? Atkins indicated staff direction and rule design are underway and suggested the proposal could be finalized before year‑end. Implementation timelines will depend on internal drafting, stakeholder feedback, and any resource or legal considerations inside the SEC. How can crypto projects prepare to participate? Document design and risks : Prepare technical and compliance documentation that explains token mechanics, governance, and risk mitigation. Define limited pilot scope : Draft a time‑limited test plan with participant limits, caps, and clear success metrics. Plan disclosures and reporting : Establish investor protections, transparent disclosures, and reporting cadence to regulator staff. Engage legal and compliance early : Allocate counsel resources to map how the pilot intersects with existing securities and commodities rules. Collect operational data : Build monitoring and audit trails to share empirical results with supervisors during the pilot. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to prepare a crypto pilot for the SEC innovation exemption"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step guidance for projects preparing to apply for conditional exemptive relief under the SEC innovation exemption framework."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Document design and risks"", ""text"": ""Prepare technical and compliance documentation describing token mechanics, governance, and risk controls."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Define limited pilot scope"", ""text"": ""Create a time-limited test plan with user caps, transaction limits, and clear success metrics."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Plan disclosures and reporting"", ""text"": ""Set up investor disclosures and a reporting cadence to provide transparency to supervising staff."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Engage legal and compliance early"", ""text"": ""Work with counsel to map regulatory intersections and draft conditional relief requests."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Collect operational data"", ""text"": ""Implement monitoring, logging, and audit trails to support evaluation."" } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What types of projects could qualify for the innovation exemption?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Eligible projects are likely to include on‑chain DeFi protocols, tokenization pilots, payment innovations, and other fintech experiments that meet defined investor protection and reporting standards."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will the innovation exemption prevent future enforcement?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Conditional relief is meant to protect approved pilots operating within defined terms; projects that violate those terms could still face enforcement actions."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How long will supervised pilots last?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The SEC has indicated pilots will be time‑limited, but exact durations will be set in the exemption terms and may vary by program and risk profile."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How does the innovation exemption affect DeFi builders? The exemption could allow DeFi teams to test protocols in limited, supervised environments without immediate threat of retroactive enforcement, provided they meet disclosure and reporting requirements set by the SEC staff. Will this bring crypto firms back to the U.S.? Proponents say clearer supervised pathways could lower the incentive to leave the U.S. by offering defined, compliant routes for experimentation that preserve investor protections. Key Takeaways Defined testing path : The innovation exemption aims to replace ad hoc enforcement with a predictable pilot framework. Supervised experimentation : Projects would operate temporarily under SEC oversight with specific disclosure and reporting obligations. Preparation is essential : Teams should document design, define pilot scope, and build reporting and monitoring before applying. Conclusion The SEC innovation exemption represents a significant shift toward engagement: a conditional relief framework designed to let crypto projects test innovations under supervision while the agency finalizes broader rules. If implemented with realistic conditions that reflect on‑chain mechanics, the exemption could foster responsible U.S. innovation and stronger regulatory data.

Prices are volatile, and traders are cautious. The crypto fear and greed index shows mixed emotions, with many waiting for a new opportunity. Analysts are now turning their focus to DeFi tokens still trading under $1. Among these, one project is gaining strong attention for its structure and timing — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . A DeFi project building real utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a lending and borrowing system that blends flexibility and safety. It offers two options for users. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model will let lenders deposit into audited smart contracts. In return, they will receive mtTokens that track their share of the pool. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model will connect users directly, allowing them to set their own loan terms. This dual design will help Mutuum Finance (MUTM) grow across DeFi networks. It will also allow users to use mtTokens as collateral or stake them for extra rewards. Every action — lending, borrowing, or staking — will generate activity that supports the MUTM token. Analysts see this as a strong base for long-term growth. The presale is now in Phase 6, with a token price of $0.035. Over 60% of tokens from this phase are already sold. The next stage, Phase 7, will start at $0.040, a 15% increase. So far, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised around $16.88 million and attracted more than 16,800 holders. The total supply stands at 4 billion tokens, showing both scale and scarcity. Why analysts expect a breakout Analysts point to three reasons for Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s growing appeal. First is its buy-and-distribute system. The platform will use part of its revenue to buy MUTM tokens from the market. These tokens will then go to the mtToken stakers as rewards. This process will create constant buying pressure. The second reason is the beta launch before exchange listings. Users will test the main features early, such as lending, borrowing, and staking. This will help build trust and attract new users ahead of trading. It also gives Mutuum Finance (MUTM) real activity before launch, something few presale tokens achieve. Third is its focus on liquidity and security. The project has completed a CertiK audit, scoring high on both TokenScan and Skynet evaluations. It has also set up a $50,000 bug bounty and a $100,000 giveaway to engage the community and reward participants. These steps show a serious commitment to safety and transparency — two things investors value when investing in crypto. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also expected to pursue listings on top exchanges like Binance and MEXC after launch. These listings will expand global access, boost liquidity, and strengthen investor confidence. An early investor who joined in Phase 3 at $0.02 already sees about 70% paper gains at the current presale price. With a planned listing target of $0.06, many expect this growth trend to continue as the platform launches and new buyers enter the market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also plans to introduce Enhanced Collateral Efficiency, a feature that allows users to borrow more safely with correlated assets. This will increase borrowing capacity and transaction volume without adding extra risk. Combined with its restricted collateral mode, the project will maintain stability even as it grows. These functions are part of a larger goal: to build a self-sustaining DeFi system that rewards activity and keeps liquidity flowing. Analysts believe this combination of steady revenue, staker rewards, and reserve growth will help MUTM outperform most tokens trading under $1 today. Retail traders are now paying close attention. Many see Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a safer way to enter DeFi while prices remain low. In a market where large coins like Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) often move slowly, smaller tokens with strong fundamentals are where investors expect faster returns. The timing adds to the excitement. With over half of Phase 6 tokens already sold and the next price jump ahead, this presale phase is becoming a short window for early buyers. Once the project lists, liquidity and visibility will likely grow sharply, bringing in a wave of new participants. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines working DeFi mechanics, an audited structure, and a transparent presale. For traders watching the crypto fear and greed index and waiting for their next move, this project offers a rare mix of safety and opportunity. As analysts continue to study the top undervalued assets, many agree that the next crypto to explode will come from DeFi — and right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands at the front of that conversation.

While many investors study new crypto charts and explore bold crypto predictions for 2025, one project is standing out — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Analysts believe that this Ethereum-based DeFi platform has the structure and mechanics to repeat, and even surpass, the early bull runs once seen with ADA and XRP. A smarter dual-lending system Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Presale Phase 6 is already in motion. The total supply is set at 4B MUTM tokens. The current price is $0.035, with more than 60% of the 170 million Phase 6 tokens already sold and over 16,800 holders joining the community. The project has raised around $16.88 million, and the next phase price is locked at $0.040, a 15% increase. This stage marks the final window before the price rises again. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building a decentralized lending system with two distinct layers. The first is Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending. Here, users deposit stablecoins and blue-chip tokens into smart contracts that automatically manage borrowing and lending. These pools are audited and provide predictable rates, making them ideal for stable yield generation. Depositors receive mtTokens — yield-bearing tokens that represent their share in the pool and can be reused as collateral. The second layer is Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, a flexible zone for negotiated loans involving higher-risk tokens. These loans operate separately from the main pools to protect the platform’s total liquidity value. This separation allows Mutuum Finance (MUTM) to maintain consistent performance while still offering room for higher returns. The mix of automation and flexibility sets it apart from most DeFi projects that rely on a single lending structure. How MUTM targets 33× growth Analysts are calling Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a model of sustainable growth. The prediction of a 33× return is not based on hype but on solid infrastructure and careful economic design. The first pillar behind this forecast is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s robust oracle system. It will use Chainlink as the primary data source, backed by multiple fallback oracles and aggregated price feeds. This setup ensures reliable pricing during volatility, reducing false liquidations and attracting larger-scale institutional users. The second major driver is controlled risk through deposit and borrow caps. By setting defined ceilings for both, the platform protects against overexposure while offering consistent returns to lenders. This structure appeals to conservative investors, including treasury managers and funds that typically avoid DeFi because of its volatility. The third factor is Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE). This feature allows correlated assets, such as stablecoins or major crypto pairs, to be used more effectively. It means users can borrow more without reducing safety. For the platform, this translates into higher protocol revenue and greater staking rewards for MUTM holders. To put this in perspective, an early investor who purchased $3,500 worth of MUTM during Phase 3 at $0.020 would already be seeing value appreciation by Phase 6. Based on the projected 33× increase, the same stake could reach more than $115,000 as the project matures and listings go live. These numbers highlight why many traders studying crypto charts expect MUTM to outperform typical altcoins once the market recovers. Trust, transparency, and growth Security is one of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s strongest suits. The project has completed a CertiK audit, which includes both manual review and static analysis. The audit scored 90.00 on TokenScan and 79.00 on CertiK Skynet, reinforcing investor trust. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also running a 50,000 USDT bug bounty program, where ethical hackers can earn rewards from $200 to $2,000 depending on the severity of their findings. Alongside this, there is an ongoing $100,000 giveaway , rewarding ten winners with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. The team will launch its Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, introducing the platform’s first live features. This phase will allow early users to experience live borrowing, staking, and liquidation mechanics for ETH and USDT. After that, the Layer-2 upgrade will improve transaction speed and reduce gas fees, making the protocol ready for mainstream adoption. With over 60% of Phase 6 already sold, the presale window is closing fast. Once Phase 7 begins, the token price will climb to $0.040, signaling the final discount before the listing target of $0.060.

Capital favors liquidity: Bitcoin and Ethereum absorb institutional flows and ETF-related demand. Altcoin performance is mixed: a few top assets show YTD gains while many top-10 tokens lag. The percentage of coins above their 200-day MA fell from 78% to ~55%, signaling narrower market breadth (MacroMicro data). altcoin rally outlook: Bitcoin and Ethereum draw capital as altcoins lag; future gains will be selective and utility-driven — read expert analysis and prepare. What is causing altcoins to lag behind Bitcoin and Ethereum? Altcoin rally momentum has paused because institutional capital, ETFs, and corporate treasuries concentrate on Bitcoin and Ethereum , which offer superior liquidity and clearer market narratives. Market breadth metrics and trading flows show a structural shift toward top-layer assets as market participants adopt stricter selection criteria. How are market breadth indicators validating the divergence? Short-term breadth measures show weakness: the share of coins trading above their 200-day moving average dropped to ~55% from a 78% peak on September 13 (MacroMicro). Performance data from CoinGecko highlights that while some tokens have double-digit YTD gains, many top-10 assets show flat or negative returns. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Experts: Altcoins Lag as Capital Favors Bitcoin and Ethereum; Future Rallies Will Be Selective"", ""description"": ""Altcoin rally outlook: capital concentrates in Bitcoin and Ethereum due to liquidity and institutional flows; any future altcoin gains will be selective and utility-driven."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-08T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-08T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }} Why are institutions favoring Bitcoin and Ethereum? Institutions prefer assets with deep order books and regulated exposure routes. ETFs, corporate allocations, and custody solutions have funneled capital into Bitcoin and Ethereum , increasing their market share. Experts at HashKey Group and Presto Research note the market’s maturation and the reduced impact of retail-driven “vibe” rallies. How selective will any future altcoin rally be? Experts expect rallies to be targeted. Tokens anchored to real-world utility—payments, tokenized assets, robust DeFi primitives, or clear enterprise use cases—are more likely to attract capital. Narrative-only tokens with low circulating supply and weak liquidity will likely remain sidelined. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Will altcoins see a broad rally soon?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A broad altcoin rally is unlikely in the near term.

Institutional flows concentrate capital into assets with regulated access and custody, notably Bitcoin and Ethereum. This reduces available capital for smaller-cap altcoins and raises the liquidity premium for top-layer tokens. What does a drop from 78% to ~55% above the 200-day MA imply? It signals weakening market breadth: fewer assets are in long-term uptrends, indicating leadership is narrowing to a handful of tokens and that any broad-based advance is less probable without renewed breadth. Can retail-driven rallies still occur? Yes—pockets of retail-driven strength remain possible in niche sectors. These rallies tend to be short-lived and localized rather than market-wide, as institutional flows exert dominant influence. Key Takeaways Market concentration : Institutional and ETF flows favor Bitcoin and Ethereum, reducing capital for many altcoins. Selectivity : Future altcoin rallies will reward utility, liquidity, and clear value creation over narrative-only stories. Action : Monitor on-chain liquidity, trading depth, and real-world use cases when evaluating altcoin opportunities. Conclusion The current market shows a clear tilt toward Bitcoin and Ethereum as capital prioritizes liquidity and institutional accessibility. While some altcoins may outperform, any altcoin rally is likely to be selective and utility-driven, signaling a maturing market that rewards demonstrable value.

Had he held, the position would be worth roughly $188 million today, highlighting the trade-off between realized gains and long-term opportunity cost in crypto. David Schwartz bought 40,000 ETH at $0.311 and sold when ETH reached $1. His sale generated an early profit but forfeited a position now estimated at about $188 million. Schwartz used the proceeds to install solar panels, underscoring a practical, sustainability-focused choice. David Schwartz sold 40,000 ETH early; the missed opportunity is now ~ $188M — read why he chose solar panels and what it means for crypto investors. Learn more. Ripple CTO David Schwartz’s early Ethereum sell-off—used to buy solar panels—remains a defining “what if” story in crypto, blending technical vision with practical lifestyle choices. What happened when David Schwartz sold his Ethereum early? David Schwartz sold his 40,000 ETH position after Ethereum rose from $0.311 to $1, realizing an early profit. He then used the proceeds to install solar panels, choosing a tangible, sustainable investment over holding for potential future gains. How large was the missed opportunity in dollar terms? Based on current market estimates, Schwartz’s 40,000 ETH would be worth approximately $188 million today. That figure reflects a total return of roughly 1,521,498% from the original ICO price, illustrating how early exits can forgo extreme long-term upside. Why did Schwartz choose solar panels instead of holding? Schwartz prioritized immediate, practical benefits: energy independence, reduced utility costs, and environmental impact. The decision aligns with broader tech-community interest in renewable energy and reflects a preference for converting speculative gains into lasting infrastructure. Frequently Asked Questions Did David Schwartz buy Ethereum during the 2015 ICO? Yes. Schwartz purchased 40,000 ETH during Ethereum’s 2015 token offering at about $0.311 per token and sold when the price reached $1, securing an early profit. How much profit did he make from that sale? He realized a roughly 321.5% return on that position when selling at $1, turning the initial investment into a substantial—but ultimately smaller—sum than it would be today. Is the $188 million figure exact? The $188 million estimate is an approximate valuation based on current market prices for ETH and the stated 40,000-token position. Market prices fluctuate and valuations are estimates, not audited figures. Context and Analysis David Schwartz’s choice illustrates a common trade-off in crypto: realized gains versus long-term hold value. Many early investors have similar stories where practical needs or risk tolerance guided sales. The episode underscores timing risk and personal priorities in volatile markets. Schwartz remains a prominent engineer and contributor to the XRP Ledger. His public anecdotes carry weight in the crypto community, not because of market outcomes alone but due to his technical influence and ongoing role in blockchain development. How should investors interpret stories like this? Use such stories as perspective, not prescription. They highlight behavioral finance principles: lock-in bias, regret aversion, and opportunity cost. Investors should align decisions with objectives, risk tolerance, and time horizon rather than anecdotal outcomes. Summary Table: Original Position vs. Current Estimate Metric Value ETH purchased 40,000 Purchase price (per ETH) $0.311 Sale price used $1.00 Approx. current position value ~$188,000,000 Reported realized gain at sale ~321.5% Approx. total upside to date ~1,521,498% Key Takeaways Practical choice: Schwartz converted crypto gains into a sustainable home improvement. Opportunity cost: Early sales can forgo large future returns, but also reduce exposure to volatility. Investor lesson: Align exits with personal goals—short-term needs may justify realized gains. Conclusion David Schwartz’s sale of 40,000 ETH and purchase of solar panels is a clear example of how personal priorities shape financial decisions. The episode connects themes of early cryptocurrency investment, renewable energy, and risk management. For investors, the core lesson is to define objectives and manage opportunity cost deliberately. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""David Schwartz’s Early ETH Sale and the $188M Missed Opportunity"", ""description"": ""David Schwartz sold 40,000 ETH early and used the proceeds to buy solar panels.

This year’s bull run is shaping up to be the most spectacular in crypto history, and retail traders are scrambling to identify which assets can deliver the biggest returns before the cycle peaks. Ethereum Leads the Market as Whales Accumulate Ethereum has once again taken center stage, rallying sharply over the past week and inching closer to the $5,000 mark. The surge is largely driven by increased whale accumulation and renewed optimism surrounding the potential approval of a spot Ethereum ETF in major markets. According to on-chain data, large holders have added more than 280,000 ETH to their wallets in just ten days, signaling strong institutional interest. In addition, Ethereum’s fundamentals remain solid. The network continues to dominate decentralized finance (DeFi), NFT activity, and real-world asset tokenization – all areas expected to thrive under the growing altcoin ETF narrative. Analysts believe that a successful breakout above $5,000 could trigger a wave of momentum that pushes ETH toward $5,500 or higher in the coming weeks. With staking participation at record highs and more than 33 million ETH locked, supply on exchanges continues to tighten, adding further bullish pressure. Ethereum’s long-term outlook remains one of the strongest in the market, but while it leads the rally, not every major altcoin is sharing the same success story. Cardano (ADA) Faces Growing Pressure Cardano, which entered the year with high expectations, has struggled to keep pace with the broader market rally. The token, currently trading around $0.83, has seen weak follow-through from investors despite ongoing network developments. While the Voltaire governance phase and Hydra scaling updates remain in progress, ADA’s price has lagged as traders rotate into faster-moving assets. Some analysts suggest that Cardano’s underperformance may stem from liquidity moving toward higher-volatility plays – particularly meme coins and early-stage presales that have shown massive short-term potential. Despite this, long-term holders remain optimistic that Cardano’s slow and methodical development approach will eventually pay off, especially as regulatory clarity improves and more institutional funds enter the proof-of-stake ecosystem. Still, the contrast between Ethereum’s strong momentum and Cardano’s stagnation highlights a clear trend in 2025: the market is rewarding speed, innovation, and community hype. That’s exactly where MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as the biggest new name in crypto. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Breakout Altcoin Taking Over 2025 In a year defined by explosive rallies, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the most exciting and widely discussed projects in the entire market. The token has dominated social media discussions and trending lists on X, with investors calling it the next potential 50x altcoin of this bull cycle. Following full audits by HashEX and CertiK, MAGACOIN FINANCE has proven to be one of the most secure and transparent early-stage projects of the year. The presale success has been nothing short of extraordinary – selling out multiple stages in record time and attracting tens of thousands of investors eager to capture early exposure before major exchange listings. Analysts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE’s combination of strong fundamentals, innovative ecosystem plans, and viral community momentum as reasons for its massive growth Unlike most meme-inspired tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE focuses on building real value for holders through ecosystem expansion, reward-based participation, and long-term scalability. Its early adoption curve resembles the breakout patterns seen during the initial runs of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, but analysts argue MAGACOIN FINANCE’s transparency and roadmap make it a more sustainable play. With the current market hype surrounding presale tokens, it’s no surprise that retail traders are flocking to MAGACOIN FINANCE. Many see it as the ultimate opportunity to catch a high-growth asset before it becomes mainstream – the type of chance that only comes once per cycle. Market Outlook: Momentum Remains Strong Across the Board The crypto market as a whole remains in bullish territory, with total market capitalization pushing toward record highs. Institutional inflows continue to pour into Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, but retail money is rotating toward altcoins with high upside potential. BNB, Solana, and XRP are holding steady, while meme and presale tokens are driving some of the highest percentage gains of the year. The overall sentiment suggests that 2025 could mark one of the most profitable cycles in crypto history – particularly for investors who identify emerging projects early. Conclusion Ethereum’s rally underscores the growing institutional appetite for high-cap assets, while Cardano’s muted performance highlights the challenges facing slower-moving blockchains in this fast-paced environment. But as the market continues to evolve, MAGACOIN FINANCE is taking charge as the standout new opportunity of the year. With a verified audit trail, massive presale success, and analysts predicting up to 50x returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents the next major wave of early-stage crypto growth – and could soon join the ranks of 2025’s top-performing assets.

This silent evolution is redefining how value, contracts, and trust can operate on the leading secure blockchain. How Layer-2s Are Turning Bitcoin Into A Dynamic Ecosystem Bitcoin’s new all-time high (ATH) is dominating the timeline, but it’s not the real story. Under the surface of price charts and speculation, a quiet technological revolution is taking shape and could redefine BTC’s utility in the ecosystem. In an X post, High Tower revealed the real ATH is in the code, and the movement centers on BitVM2, an evolution of the original BitVM model. While some are watching the price, projects such as Fiamma are turning this concept into working code. Related Reading: Here’s Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed After Hitting $125,700 All-Time High At its core, BitVM was a concept that enabled complex computations to run off-chain using BTC only as the final arbiter. However, the system came with a catch, and it relied on a single verifier that had to stay online 24/7 to detect fraud, acting as a single point of oversight. If the verifier went offline or missed a dishonest move, the integrity of the system was compromised. BitVM2 fundamentally flips this model. Instead of depending on the verifier, it shifts the burden of honesty onto the prover. The prover doing the computation must continuously prove they are honest. If they cheat, that collateral can be claimed by anyone monitoring the chain. For the first time, on-chain proofs are not dependent on a single constantly online watchdog. This change unlocks the door to truly trust-minimized bridges and Layer-2 solutions on BTC that don’t rely on federations or wrapped assets. Instead, the system relies on economic incentives and on-chain fraud proofs. Thus, using native BTC in DeFi, not wrapped versions like wBTC, could soon move freely across DeFi systems, which is where projects like Fiamma Labs come in. Fiamma is building the first EVM-compatible layer on top of BitVM2, enabling smart contracts to run directly with BTC’s native security. Tower added that it’s too early to call this the endgame for Layer-2s, but architecturally, it’s a major leap forward. Where Bitcoin Could Catch Its Breath Bitcoin’s climb to new all-time highs has once again captured market attention. Crypto trader Lennaert Snyder has mentioned that the move isn’t as one-sided as it looks. While momentum remains strong, Bitcoin’s chart reveals significant liquidity pools to the downside. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bear Trap Over? Pundit Reveals Where The Market Is At Right Now According to Snyder, BTC’s recent breakout has left behind multiple support zones, represented as boxes on his chart, and two paths are likely from here. Either BTC holds these highs and continues to run, or BTC flushes out longs before a sharp reversal upward. The trader specifically highlights the $113,500 to $114,800 range as a key liquidity flush.

Based on reports, the remark has sparked a rush of headlines that frame the move as a major step toward crypto payments in real estate, but company announcements with full details are not yet available. Executive Signals On Social Media According to posts on X, Kaz Nejatian , who recently took over as CEO, answered a user who asked whether Opendoor would take Bitcoin. Nejatian wrote, “We will. Just need to prioritize it.” That short reply was picked up by several crypto outlets, and the coverage carried headlines saying a roughly $6 billion real estate firm is preparing to accept crypto as a form of payment. Reports have disclosed that some stories interpret Nejatian’s answer as a firm plan, while others treat it as an exploratory signal rather than a finished program. We will. Just need to prioritize it. — Kaz Nejatian (@CanadaKaz) October 6, 2025 Board Moves And Company Size Opendoor is a large consumer real estate platform that buys homes, renovates them, and resells them. Based on reports, recent leadership changes include Nejatian’s appointment as CEO and the return of co-founders Keith Rabois and Eric Wu to the board. The company’s profile and scale — often reported around $6 billion in value in coverage of the story — help explain why the hint drew quick attention from investors and crypto watchers. Legal And Financial Context Recent reports note Opendoor still faces outstanding legal and investor issues, including a $39 million settlement tied to earlier claims about its pricing practices. That matter remains separate from the crypto signal, but it adds context for readers: Opendoor is a capital-heavy business that operates in tight markets and under regulatory scrutiny. Any move to accept Bitcoin would have to fit into mortgage rules, closing procedures, money-transmission laws, and tax reporting obligations, all of which have been flagged by analysts as likely complicating factors. How Crypto Payments Might Work Based on the reporting so far, one plausible approach would be for buyers to pay in Bitcoin while Opendoor or a partner immediately converts proceeds into dollars for settlement, shielding sellers from crypto price swings and custody responsibilities. Such arrangements have been used in other industries where firms accept crypto for high-value transactions. No confirmation has been published about which cryptocurrencies would be allowed, whether partial payments would be possible, or which partners might handle conversion and custody.

The price is now consolidating losses and might continue to move down if it trades below $2.850. XRP price is slowly moving lower below the $2.920 pivot zone. The price is now trading below $2.950 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a key declining channel with support at $2.90 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it settles below $2.850. XRP Price Dips Again XRP price failed to stay above $3.020 and started a fresh decline, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price declined below $3.00 and $2.950 to enter a short-term bearish zone. Besides, there was a break below a key declining channel with support at $2.90 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price tested the $2.850 zone and is currently consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.049 swing high to the $2.850 swing low. The price is now trading below $2.920 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.90 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.950 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.049 swing high to the $2.850 swing low. A clear move above the $2.950 resistance might send the price toward the $3.00 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $3.020 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $3.050. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $3.00 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.850 level. The next major support is near the $2.80 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.80 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.7250. The next major support sits near the $2.650 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.60.

The leading cryptocurrency by market value has dropped 2.4% to $121,340, after failing to break through key resistance above $126,000 early this week, according to CoinDesk data. The Coindesk 20 Index has declined over 4% to 4,186 points. The decline comes as the dollar index, which tracks the greenback's exchange rate against a basket of fiat currencies, rose to 98.90, the highest level since Aug. 5. Strength in the DXY typically weighs on USD-denominated assets, such as BTC and gold. BTC's price chart suggests scope for a deeper decline to $118,000. BTC hit record high over $126,000 early this week, as U.S.-listed spot ETFs pulled in over $3 billion in the week ended Friday. Gold driven higher by ETF inflows While BTC's rally has stalled, gold is showing no signs of slowing down, as its per-ounce price has surged past $4,000 for the first time in its history. According to ING, the recent rally is catalyzed by a surge in inflows into gold-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ""Investors are adding gold ETFs at a rapid pace. Last week, gold-backed exchange-traded funds expanded again, taking the total gold ETF holdings to the highest level since September 2022. There is still room for further additions, given the current total remains shy of the peak hit in 2020. More inflows could push gold even higher,"" ING's analysts said. Prices have doubled in two years, spurred by central banks buying the yellow metal to diversify away from the U.S. dollar. President Donald Trump's aggressive trade policy and conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine have added to the bullish momentum. Gold-backed tokens such as PAXG (PAXG) Tether Gold (XAUT) have also risen above $4,000.

52828705,https://invezz.com/?p=2915459,1759897399,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Crypto market crash: Why are Bitcoin and altcoins going down today?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/08/crypto-market-crash-why-are-bitcoin-and-altcoins-going-down-today/,"A crypto market crash is happening, with Bitcoin plunging below the important support level at $121,000 and the total market capitalization of all coins falling to $4.15 trillion. Some of the top laggards in the crypto industry were coins like DoubleZero, World Liberty Financial (WLFI), Pi Network, Zcash, and Pi Network, which all plunged by over 10% in the last 24 hours. Crypto market crash triggered by high liquidations The first main reason why the crypto market crash happened is that liquidations surged in the last 24 hours, forcefully closing positions. Over 180,000 traders who were long cryptocurrencies were liquidated. Most of the liquidations happened with Ethereum whose positions worth over $170 million were closed. Bitcoin positions worth $160 million were liquidated, while Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin positions worth $48 million, $25 million, and $20 million were closed. The crypto market normally crashes when long positions are closed forcefully by exchanges, as this usually means more selling among investors. Crypto liquidations | Source: CoinGlass Crypto crash is happening because of profit-taking The other main reason why the crypto crash is happening is that investors are booking profits after a recent rally. Bitcoin price plunged to $120,000, a few days after it soared to a record high of over $126,000. Other cryptocurrencies also plunged after the recent rally because of profit-taking among investors. It is highly common for this profit-taking to happen after the crypto or stock market experiences a strong rally over time. Stock market crash amid AI jitters The crypto market crash is also happening because of the jitters in the stock market, where some investors are concerned about the AI bubble . One reason for this was a 2.52% crash in Oracle shares , which led to more downside among companies in the AI industry like Nebius and CoreWeave. The crash happened after a report by The Information warned that Oracle was struggling to profit from the ongoing AI boom despite the massive backlog. Investors are also concerned about the circular nature of the AI industry, where companies like Nvidia and AMD have announced massive deals with clients like OpenAI and Anthropic. For example, Nvidia announced a $100 billion deal with OpenAI that will see the latter buy its chips and possibly create to illusion of demand. The same is true with the latest deal between AMD and OpenAI. Altogether, OpenAI has announced deals worth over $1 trillion and analysts are questioning how it will ever generate a return on investment. Some analysts and investors, including Thoma Bravo, have started to warn of a potential bubble in the AI industry. Bubbles often pop at once as happened in 2000 or over an extended period. US government shutdown ending odds The other main reason why the crypto market is crashing is that investors now expect that the government shutdown will take a long period to end. Odds that it will happen on October 15 or later rose by 6% in the last 24 hours to $75%. Those between October 10 and 14 dropped to 23%. The government shutdown has implications on the crypto market. On the positive side, it is leading to more demand for Bitcoin, which is seen as a safe haven like gold. It is also a positive one as it is affecting the economy, which will push the Fed to cut interest rates. On the other hand, a prolonged shutdown means altcoin ETFs like XRP and Solana will take longer to be approved.

Currently trading around $0.83 , ADA is holding firm above key support levels but struggling to break past resistance near $0.90. The sideways movement comes as traders weigh the next phase of the bull market and assess where capital could flow next. While ADA remains a solid long-term contender, attention in recent days has shifted toward faster-moving assets such as TRON (TRX) and early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE, a presale project that analysts say could become one of the best-performing altcoins of 2025. Cardano Consolidates Ahead of Major Move After surging nearly 20 percent in late September, Cardano’s price has flattened, leaving investors wondering whether a breakout or correction is next. The consolidation follows a period of heavy accumulation, with on-chain data showing steady increases in wallet addresses and staking participation. Cardano’s total value locked (TVL) remains strong, sitting near $425 million, reflecting growing activity within its DeFi ecosystem. Developers continue to expand partnerships and improve interoperability, with recent progress in cross-chain integration via Hydra and Mithril. These updates aim to enhance speed and scalability, which could help ADA regain momentum once market conditions align. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic. If ADA can maintain support at $0.80, a push toward $1 looks likely in the short term. However, a drop below $0.78 could invite short-term selling pressure before any rebound occurs. TRON Gains Ground While Cardano holds steady, TRON (TRX) has been gaining quiet strength. Trading at $0.34 , TRX has climbed steadily over the past few weeks, benefiting from consistent network activity and strong USDT transaction volumes. TRON’s stablecoin ecosystem continues to expand rapidly, now accounting for nearly half of all USDT transfers across the crypto market. This dominance has provided a steady source of transaction fees and revenue for the network, keeping it profitable even in volatile market conditions. Analysts attribute TRON’s steady rise to its resilience and consistent growth strategy. While other projects chase new narratives, TRON has focused on real-world utility and maintaining one of the most active blockchain user bases globally. If this momentum continues, TRX could test $0.40 by November, marking one of its best performances since 2021. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Emerging Leader for 2025 Amid the steady moves of established altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE has captured the spotlight as one of the most promising early-stage projects in the market. The presale has already raised more than $15.5 million, drawing massive attention from investors looking for the next big opportunity before listings begin. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out is the level of preparation behind it. The project has undergone full audits by HashEx and CertiK, ensuring maximum transparency and security for early participants. Analysts highlight this as one of the key reasons why retail investors are calling it one of the best altcoin picks for 2025. Unlike typical presales that rely on hype alone, MAGACOIN has built a strong foundation around real community involvement and structured tokenomics. The development team has prioritized building long-term sustainability rather than short-term speculation, creating confidence that the project can maintain momentum once it goes live on exchanges. The community-driven model has also attracted attention from smaller investors who missed earlier runs in major coins like Solana or Cardano. By offering low initial entry points and verified legitimacy, MAGACOIN FINANCE gives newcomers a credible chance to be part of a high-growth project before the broader market catches on. Market Rotation and Investor Behavior The current stage of the bull market is seeing a clear rotation of capital. Large-cap coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are consolidating after massive gains, and that often opens the door for mid- and low-cap assets to outperform. Historically, this rotation marks the beginning of “altcoin season,” when traders shift their profits from major assets into smaller tokens with greater upside potential. TRON’s steady rise fits perfectly into this trend, while MAGACOIN FINANCE’s explosive presale growth suggests that new investors are actively seeking fresh opportunities rather than waiting for top coins to move again. Social data also supports this trend. Mentions of presale projects and new altcoin investments have surged on X (formerly Twitter) and Telegram, while large exchange inflows are declining – a sign that traders are holding and accumulating instead of cashing out. Cardano’s Long-Term Outlook Despite the short-term slowdown, analysts remain positive on Cardano’s long-term trajectory. The network continues to evolve, with strong community backing and an active developer ecosystem. Once market conditions improve and liquidity flows back into Layer-1 platforms, ADA could easily revisit the $1.20 to $1.30 range seen in prior bull phases. Still, traders are diversifying. With TRON gaining momentum and MAGACOIN FINANCE setting presale records, investors are looking beyond the traditional top 10 coins to maximize returns before the next market surge. Conclusion Cardano’s consolidation around $0.83 suggests that the market is waiting for its next catalyst, while TRON quietly builds strength and expands its user base. At the same time, the spotlight is shifting toward presales, where investors are chasing early access to projects with strong fundamentals. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the top contenders for 2025, combining verified audits, structured growth, and strong community participation. For traders positioning for the next leg of the bull market, it represents the kind of opportunity that could define the next wave of high-performance altcoins.

A billion-token liquidation wave marked the day’s lows, but late-session prints showed smart money stepping back, hinting at a possible base. News Background Macro headwinds remain central to the picture. Traders are pricing in nearly 98% odds of global monetary easing by year-end, a backdrop that has fueled volatility across FX and crypto alike. Meme-coins like DOGE tend to trade as high-beta plays on liquidity, meaning they can swing harder in both directions when global conditions shift. On the structural side, ETF filings from firms such as Grayscale and Bitwise keep DOGE in the conversation around broader institutional flows, even if the immediate focus has been on bitcoin and ether. That narrative gives DOGE liquidity profile a longer tail than retail hype alone. Mining investment has quietly expanded through 2025, supporting accumulation trends among whales. Infrastructure flows matter because they underpin supply distribution, and continued capital inflow into DOGE mining signals confidence in the asset’s longer-term viability. Price Action Summary Resistance at $0.27 was reinforced after rejection on heavy 632.9 million volume, setting a clear ceiling for traders to watch. The steepest decline unfolded during the 13:00–15:00 UTC window, when DOGE fell 5% in just two hours as over a billion tokens exchanged hands. Support at $0.25 proved resilient. That level triggered both whale accumulation and short covering, preventing a deeper slide into the $0.24 range. The final 60 minutes of trade saw DOGE rebound roughly 1% from its lows, breaking intraday resistance levels around $0.25 on steady prints of 30 million DOGE at a time. A double-bottom pattern between 23:49 and 00:00 reinforced the idea of a technical base. The 24-hour trading range stretched $0.144, or about 4.8%, making it one of the wider sessions in recent weeks and highlighting fragile order books. Technical View Resistance: $0.27 remains the immediate ceiling after repeated failures; sustained closes above it would be required to flip trend bias higher. Support: $0.25 is the key structural floor for now, defended by whales; if broken, the next downside target sits near $0.24. Volume: Daily averages around 500 million were dwarfed by liquidation spikes over 1 billion, signaling institutional distribution pressure at highs. Pattern: Symmetrical triangle structure points to a breakout range of $0.30–$0.47 once momentum resolves. Momentum: The late-session bounce confirms near-term accumulation, but overall trend remains capped below $0.27. What Traders Are Watching Whether $0.25 continues to hold as structural support or gives way to a deeper test at $0.24. If whale accumulation of 30 million DOGE marks the cycle bottom or represents opportunistic entry before further volatility. How pending SEC rulings on DOGE-linked ETF filings shape liquidity and institutional positioning. Macro drivers: the balance between easing bets and renewed inflation risks, and how they impact risk appetite for high-beta tokens like DOGE.

The financial institution added that Bitcoin had risen to over $125,000 in October 2025 as gold approached $4,000 per ounce. This price spike highlights the important shift towards central bank views as the dollar weakens. Deutsche Bank says Bitcoin is becoming more like gold Deutsche Bank analysts Marion Laboure and Camilla Siazon stated that Bitcoin is becoming a more stable and trusted asset, similar to gold, as its price continues to rise and its volatility is currently at the lowest level in history. They said that central banks will one day hold Bitcoin as part of their official reserves, as its behaviour starts to resemble that of gold. Laboure and Siazon said that “a strategic Bitcoin allocation could emerge as a modern cornerstone of financial security , echoing gold’s role in the 20th century.” They explained that both Bitcoin and gold were similar in terms of scarcity, liquidity, and the ability to hold value when major currencies lose strength. Both are also independent from governments, and their worth is not tied to any one country’s economy. The researchers noted that these qualities make both Bitcoin and gold highly appealing, especially now that people are losing trust in traditional currencies, such as the U.S. dollar. Deutsche Bank expects both assets to appear on central bank balance sheets by 2030. Global reserves shift as central banks diversify from the U.S. dollar Countries have relied heavily on the U.S. dollar as their main reserve currency for decades. Still, many governments in markets such as China, India, Brazil, and Turkey are today rethinking their dependence on the dollar. These markets are concerned that U.S. political decisions, economic sanctions, and changes in interest rates will have a significant impact on their economies. Many central banks have been quietly acquiring more gold each year to bolster their reserves and safeguard themselves against the declining value of the dollar. In 2025, gold prices have risen by more than 50%, and analysts from Goldman Sachs have recently raised their target price for the asset to $4,900 per ounce. They said its demand is very strong and doesn’t seem to be slowing down. Bitcoin is also quietly becoming part of this trend. Many large companies and investors have begun holding Bitcoin in their long-term portfolios and building Bitcoin treasuries over the past few years. Deutsche Bank stated that Bitcoin is gaining credibility as more institutions are beginning to trust it. Bitcoin also operates on a decentralized network, so central banks in countries seeking to reduce their exposure to U.S. financial policies can purchase the coin to obtain the protection that gold alone cannot provide. However, many people still argue that Bitcoin is too risky for official reserves because it lacks intrinsic value, has no physical form, and is not backed by a government guarantee. Deutsche Bank’s analysts argue that the criticism is justified, but they also note the significant decline in the coin’s volatility, while its trading volumes and liquidity continue to increase. According to them, these improvements make Bitcoin a more stable and usable asset than it was a few years ago. The financial institution believes that Bitcoin will become a realistic option for central banks seeking to diversify their reserves if it continues to mature and behave more like a traditional store of value, such as gold.

Cardano trades near $0.85, consolidating ahead of the SEC’s ADA ETF ruling expected to influence short-term and institutional sentiment. A confirmed breakout above $0.95 could trigger a 50% rally toward $1.30, supported by tightening technical indicators and increased ETF demand. The SEC decision date (Grayscale ADA ETF ruling set for Oct 26) and new ETF filings by REX Shares and Osprey Funds have intensified market positioning and liquidity expectations. Cardano ETF decision: ADA trades near $0.85 ahead of the SEC ruling—monitor $0.95 for breakout toward $1.30. Read the full market outlook. Cardano trades near $0.85 as anticipation grows for the SEC’s ADA ETF decision, which could trigger a breakout toward $1.3. Cardano’s price action is currently consolidating in a narrowing range around $0.85 as traders position for the SEC’s ADA ETF decision. Low volatility and tightening ranges often precede larger moves, making the coming sessions critical for determining the medium-term trend for ADA price . What is the SEC Cardano ETF decision and how could it affect ADA price? The Cardano ETF decision refers to the SEC’s ruling on applications for exchange-traded funds that would hold ADA. Approval typically increases institutional access and liquidity, which can materially lift ADA price; denial or delay can keep ADA rangebound or push it lower in the short term. How likely is a breakout to $1.30 if ADA clears $0.95? Technically, a verified close above $0.95 would invalidate the current short-term resistance and could open a measured move of roughly 50%, targeting approximately $1.30. Indicators showing lower volatility, contracting Bollinger Bands, and rising relative strength on higher timeframe charts support a scenario where a breakout leads to accelerated upside. Conversely, failure to clear $0.95 may see ADA retrace to support near $0.75. Trading volume and ETF-related flows will be the main drivers; historical ETF approvals in the market (plain text references: previous crypto ETF approvals and filings) show increased institutional buying that materially changes market structure. Cardano has been attempting to escape a multi-week descending channel. A sustained breakout would shift momentum in favor of buyers and attract liquidity from spot and institutional desks. Analysts note that confirmation requires follow-through buying and expanding volume on higher timeframes. Source: TradingView The SEC decision on Grayscale’s ADA ETF, scheduled for October 26, has become the focal point for market participants. Several asset managers, including REX Shares and Osprey Funds, have also filed single-asset crypto ETF applications that include ADA, highlighting growing institutional interest in Cardano as a network and an investable asset. Why do ETF filings reinforce market confidence for Cardano? ETF filings increase accessibility for large institutional investors who prefer regulated investment vehicles. Inclusion of ADA in filings from multiple issuers signals broader industry intent to offer Cardano exposure to institutional clients. That shift can increase demand, narrow bid-ask spreads, and deepen liquidity, all of which are positive for price discovery. Market participants point to filings and official SEC documentation (plain text: SEC filings and Grayscale application documents) as evidence of a maturing institutional backdrop for crypto. These references, combined with technical patterns, form the basis for the current market outlook. Frequently Asked Questions Will an SEC approval immediately send ADA to $1.30? An SEC approval typically triggers an immediate liquidity-driven rally, but a move to $1.30 would require sustained buying and volume. Short-term spikes are possible; confirmation needs follow-through on higher timeframes and expanded market participation. What price levels should traders watch around the decision? Key levels: support near $0.75, current consolidation near $0.85, resistance at $0.95 for breakout confirmation, and $1.30 as the first major upside target if breakout holds. How can investors manage risk ahead of the decision? Maintain position sizing discipline, monitor volume for breakout confirmation, and consider stop levels below $0.75. Institutional flows and news around ETF filings should be tracked via official filings and reputable market-data platforms (plain text references). Key Takeaways Decision-driven volatility : The SEC ruling (Grayscale ADA ETF decision on Oct 26) is the primary catalyst for near-term ADA moves. Technical breakout target : A close above $0.95 could target ~$1.30, implying roughly 50% upside from current levels. Downside risk : Failure to break resistance could lead to a pullback toward $0.75; monitor volume and ETF flow signals. Conclusion Cardano is at an inflection point as the SEC’s ADA ETF decision approaches.

RFIA could allow 401(k)s and pensions to hold crypto, increasing workers’ exposure. Union leaders say the bill lacks meaningful oversight for bank custody and tokenized securities. Comparisons made to the 2008 crisis highlight systemic risk if banks engage in crypto trading. Responsible Financial Innovation Act risks retirement funds and systemic stability — read AFL-CIO concerns and next steps. Learn more from COINOTAG. What is the Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA)? The Responsible Financial Innovation Act (RFIA) is a Senate discussion draft intended to create a federal framework for digital assets. The bill aims to define regulatory roles and market rules, but labor leaders say it falls short on worker protections and oversight for custody and tokenization. How does the RFIA affect retirement funds and pensions? The AFL-CIO argues the RFIA would increase retirement plans’ exposure by allowing 401(k)s and pensions broader access to crypto custody and digital asset holdings. AFL-CIO director Jody Calemine warned this could place pension assets at higher risk without strict safeguards. The letter to the Senate Banking Committee, authored by AFL-CIO leadership, states the draft bill “provides the facade of regulation” and lacks measures to shield workers from volatility. The concern centers on three mechanisms: bank custody of crypto, eased access for retirement plans, and explicit pathways for tokenized securities. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""AFL-CIO Says RFIA Exposes Retirement Funds to Crypto Risks"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/images/2025-10/0199c20a-1ea7-7ef2-92b8-2062096c1bcb.jpg""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-08T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-08T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/logo-coinotag.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/rfia-afl-cio-retirement-risks-2025-10-08"" }, ""description"": ""The AFL-CIO says the Senate RFIA draft could expose retirement funds to crypto risk by broadening custody and tokenization without meaningful worker protections.""} Why do labor leaders oppose the bill? AFL-CIO leaders say the bill lacks safeguards that would protect workers’ retirement savings and could place public protections like the Deposit Insurance Fund at higher risk if banks custody crypto. They highlight tokenization provisions that may allow private companies to create parallel, lightly regulated public markets. Calemine compared potential outcomes to practices that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis, noting: “Banks engaging in crypto-based hedge fund trading activity, which would be allowed under this regime, could be even riskier than some of the dangerous financial activities conducted before the 2008 financial crisis.” The RFIA was originally introduced in 2022 by Senators Cynthia Lummis and Kirsten Gillibrand and has been revised since. The Senate Banking Committee is reviewing the draft as an alternative regulatory approach to other market-structure proposals. AFL-CIO headquarters in Washington, DC. Source: AFL-CIO When could these rules change retirement plan practices? As a discussion draft, the RFIA is not yet formally introduced.

Labor leaders warn that expanded bank custody of crypto could increase pressure on taxpayer-backed Deposit Insurance Funds if banks assume higher trading or custody risks linked to volatile digital assets. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What does the AFL-CIO say about the RFIA?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The AFL-CIO says the RFIA provides a facade of regulation that would increase worker exposure by allowing retirement plans and banks to hold and custody crypto without meaningful protections."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is the RFIA law yet?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""No. The RFIA is a discussion draft under consideration by the Senate Banking Committee and has not been formally enacted."" } } ]} Key Takeaways Worker risk: AFL-CIO argues RFIA would raise pension and 401(k) exposure to crypto volatility. Systemic concern: Bank custody and tokenization could introduce new financial-stability risks. Next steps: Senate Banking Committee deliberations and amendments will shape protections; trustees should begin risk reviews now. Conclusion The AFL-CIO’s critique of the Responsible Financial Innovation Act centers on worker protections, custody standards, and tokenization risks. As the Senate Banking Committee weighs revisions, trustees and policymakers must prioritize fiduciary safeguards and systemic stability to prevent unintended exposure of pensions and deposit insurance to crypto volatility.

Bitcoin funds drew $3.24 billion across five straight “green” sessions, helping BTC notch a new all-time high near $126,200. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) led the charge, capturing $1.82 billion for the week and $970 million in a single day, while Fidelity’s FBTC, ARK 21Shares’ ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL added hundreds of millions more. Trading activity was equally torrid as Bitcoin ETF volume topped $26 billion for the week and net assets jumped to $164.5 billion, underscoring that flows, not leverage, are driving this leg higher. Ether ETFs Gain Traction as Diversification Builds Ether ETFs added $1.30 billion over the same stretch, also logging five straight days of inflows. BlackRock’s ETHA dominated with $691.7 million, followed by Fidelity’s FETH ($305.3 million), while Bitwise and Grayscale mini trusts contributed steady additions. ETH ETF volumes reached $9.9 billion and net assets climbed to $30.57 billion, signaling that institutional allocators are broadening beyond BTC, often pairing a Bitcoin core position with an Ethereum “growth” sleeve tied to staking yield, Layer-2 expansion, and smart-contract dominance. Technically, ETH is holding above key supports as it eyes $4,750–$4,800; a decisive break could magnet $5,000, adding fresh fuel to ETF demand and year-end portfolio rebalancing. Are Altcoin Funds Next After Bitcoin and Ethereum? With Bitcoin and Ether cementing their ETF beachhead, attention is shifting to potential altcoin products. Markets are tracking deadline windows and updated S-1s for large-cap names, commonly cited: Solana (SOL), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC), as issuers push to expand the investable crypto toolkit. Any green lights here would unlock fresh mandate-driven flows, deepen liquidity, and extend the rotation now visible across large caps. What to watch in Q4: Sustained ETF inflows (pace and breadth across issuers). AUM milestones (IBIT eyeing over $100 billion), a key sentiment catalyst for institutions on the sidelines. Altcoin ETF headlines that could kick off the next leg of diversification. BlackRock’s leadership in spot Bitcoin ETF inflows capped a blockbuster week that pushed BTC to records and lifted total crypto AUM. With Ether ETFs surging and altcoin funds on the horizon, the Q4 playbook increasingly favors accumulation on dips as long-only capital turns crypto into a core allocation, not a trade.

CleanCore holds 710M+ DOGE, targeting 1B Dogecoin. Holdings valued near $174M at DOGE ≈ $0.245; unrealized gains exceed $20M. Strategy emphasizes transparent, sustainable treasury growth and shareholder value. CleanCore Dogecoin holdings: 710M+ DOGE, targeting 1B; read how the company plans to scale its treasury responsibly and what it means for investors. CleanCore Solutions says it wants to scale its treasury “responsibly with transparency and resilience” as it aims to accumulate 1 billion Dogecoin tokens. What are CleanCore’s Dogecoin holdings and target? CleanCore Dogecoin holdings currently exceed 710 million DOGE, with a stated target of 1 billion Dogecoin. The company reports over $20 million in unrealized gains and cash reserves to continue accruing DOGE while pursuing a long‑term strategy to strengthen mNAV relative to market capitalization. How much is CleanCore’s DOGE stake worth and what data supports that valuation? At Dogecoin trading around $0.245 (24.5 cents), CleanCore’s holdings are valued at approximately $173.92 million. The company also disclosed raising about $175 million before expenses via a private placement on Sept. 5. Price and market-cap data referenced from CoinMarketCap and market exchanges are cited as plain text. ZONE closed the trading day on Tuesday down 8.44%. Source: Google Finance Why is CleanCore focused on mNAV and shareholder value? The company says its approach goes beyond accumulation: it plans to grow its treasury to bolster long‑term market capitalization relative to net asset value ( mNAV ) while maintaining transparency and sustainability. CEO Clayton Adams stated this aligns with insider and community visions to expand utility and demand for Dogecoin as a global digital asset. What are the risks and industry views on mNAV? Some industry analysts caution that mNAV can be misleading for firms with operating businesses beyond treasury holdings. Greg Cipolaro, global head of research at NYDIG, noted the metric may overlook operational revenue and convertible debt. Standard Chartered warns smaller firms risk overexposure if mNAVs remain depressed, potentially prompting consolidation in the sector. How could market and sector dynamics affect CleanCore’s plan? Macro and sector trends matter: the recent launch of a Dogecoin ETF in the U.S. (REX‑Osprey DOGE ETF, ticker DOJE) and varying altcoin performance influence liquidity and institutional appetite. Larger firms with diversified operations may be positioned to acquire weaker treasury-focused rivals if mNAV pressures persist. How is CleanCore funding further DOGE accumulation? CleanCore reported having sufficient cash to continue purchases and noted partnership support from Bitstamp by Robinhood. The company raised capital in a Sept. 5 private placement and claims liquidity to support ongoing accumulation without compromising balance‑sheet stability. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""CleanCore Eyes 1 Billion Dogecoin — 710M+ Held, $20M Unrealized Gains"", ""description"": ""CleanCore Dogecoin holdings: 710M+ DOGE and a target of 1 billion; company outlines a transparent, sustainable treasury growth plan to boost shareholder value."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/cleancore-doge-710m.jpg"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/images/logo.png"" } }, ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-08T00:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-08T00:00:00Z"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/cleancore-dogecoin-710m"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How many Dogecoin does CleanCore hold?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""CleanCore reports holding over 710 million Dogecoin and has publicly stated a target of accumulating 1 billion DOGE."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is mNAV and why does CleanCore mention it?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""mNAV compares market capitalization to net asset value.

52829100,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=834146,1759899623,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52829100.jpeg,"Trump Will Send Bitcoin To $250,000 By EOY With This Secret Weapon: Arthur Hayes",https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/trump-bitcoin-250000-by-eoy-arthur-hayes/,"Arthur Hayes believes Bitcoin can double into year-end—and he says the catalyst is a White House blueprint to capture the levers of US monetary policy. In an appearance on The Rollup, the BitMEX co-founder sketched a path to $250,000 per coin predicated on what he calls a “secret weapon”: a rapid consolidation of control over the Federal Reserve (Fed) that would clear the way for aggressive credit creation, yield-curve engineering, and an eventual flood of fiat liquidity into digital assets. Trump’s Fed Plan Could Catapult Bitcoin To $250,000 Hayes’ $250,000 year-end Bitcoin call rests on a narrow but explosive thesis: Donald Trump can seize functional control of the Federal Reserve within months, trigger yield-curve control by executive-pressure and personnel power, and unleash a credit impulse that spills straight into crypto via stablecoins. The BitMEX co-founder framed the pathway not as conjecture but as institutional mechanics. “It just is math. I love math,” he said. At the center is the Fed’s architecture—two bodies, two vote thresholds, one choke point. Hayes recited the plumbing crisply. “There’s a Fed Board of Governors. There’s seven members on this board. All are presidential appointees confirmed by the Senate and simple majority wins. So you need four votes out of seven to control that board.” With that majority, the White House gains three levers at once: the interest rate paid on reserve balances and terms at the discount window; supervisory stance over bank regulation; and decisive influence over who runs the 12 regional Reserve Banks—because those presidents must be approved by the governors. Related Reading: Bitcoin STH Whale Profits Hit $10.1 Billion, Highest For The Cycle The second body, the FOMC, has 12 votes; seven governors and five district presidents. Stack sympathetic leaders at the districts and the tally follows. “By having four in the governors and seven of the FOMC you’re effectively controlling the central bank,” Hayes argued. Why, then, is Governor Lisa Cook “the final domino”? Hayes ties the timing to Stephen Miran’s recent dissent on rate policy among sitting governors. He contends Trump already has two aligned votes and a plausible third; Cook is the hinge for a fourth. In his formulation, mounting legal and political pressure could force her departure on a compressed calendar. “I think it’s before the end of the year,” he said, describing an “imminent” court determination related to a mortgage- or bank-fraud matter and the likelihood of a negotiated exit irrespective of guilt or innocence: “This is all politics… what is she going to get promised in the back end to step down and exit stage left?” If Cook leaves and a replacement sails through while the Senate math still favors confirmations, the Board majority flips. With four of seven, the administration can then approve or block district-president selections coming up on the two- and four-year rotation—“in every year that ended in a one and a five… all 12 district bank presidents are up for reelection,” he noted—giving a path to seven of 12 on the FOMC. Yield Curve Control And Liquidity The policy intent is explicit: steepen the curve and run the economy hot via regional banks—what Hayes calls “QE for poor people.” The operational tools start on the short end. A governor-aligned Board can cut the rate paid on excess reserves to pull down front-end benchmarks, cheapen funding for banks, and reopen the discount window with friendlier terms. Supervision can be eased to encourage loan growth outside the money-center complex. In parallel, an FOMC majority can direct the System Open Market Account to expand—classic balance-sheet policy—while rhetorically committing to pins on the curve. The template, Hayes says, is the 1940s. “A politician can declare exigent circumstances… there are so many things that [they] could use as an excuse… and therefore the Fed is justified in combining with the Treasury and fixing the money supply.” The effect is curve management, not just cuts: “They’re going to steepen the yield curve. And so steepening the yield curve is going to bring the near end down,” while longer maturities reprice around higher nominal growth and inflation expectations. Even if long rates fall from peak levels as policy eases, the slope widens, repairing bank net-interest margins and pushing credit creation into the “heart of America.” Related Reading: 99% Of Bitcoin Supply In Profit – What This Means For Price This is the bridge to Bitcoin. A steepened curve and looser supervision channel new lending through regional banks, raising the money multiplier and nominal GDP, and pushing inflation. “When the regional bank is lending… they’re creating this new loan… they need to hire more workers… and obviously inflation grows along with it,” Hayes said. Liquidity then leaks into Bitcoin through stablecoins he expects to proliferate under a dollar-hegemony strategy. First comes T-bill carry in tokenized dollars; next comes on-chain yield; finally comes speculation. “Once you have a stablecoin… now you’ve got a dollar bank account… I can make 10–15%… I’m still broke… I’m going to speculate,” he said, pointing to perpetuals venues as the ultimate release valve for global retail leverage. The price call follows from the plumbing. Hayes reiterated a “double into the end of the year” toward $250,000 if the personnel puzzle clicks—Cook exits, replacements are confirmed, district appointments swing, and the Fed’s balance sheet plus short-end levers are brought to heel. He also flagged the political clock: razor-thin Senate margins and the risk that a post-2026 Congress could block confirmations. “If Trump has anyone who needs to be approved… it better happen before then,” he warned, adding that Powell’s chair term ending in May 2026 could compound the realignment if the earlier pieces are in place. Hayes’ macro coda is stark: the debt arithmetic forces either inflation or explicit restructuring, and both are bullish for scarce assets. He even entertained revaluing US gold to book a trillion-dollar gain—an admission of dollar devaluation that he said would carry unknowable Treasury-market consequences. Either route, he insists, is hostile to bonds and supportive of Bitcoin. “At the end of the day, you don’t want to own bonds… you want to be selling dollars and owning a hard asset like Bitcoin or gold.” At press time, BTC traded at $124.468.

What is the Kazakhstan crypto crackdown and why was it launched? Kazakhstan crypto crackdown refers to a national enforcement campaign by the Financial Monitoring Agency that terminated 130 unlicensed crypto platforms and confiscated $16.7 million in digital assets to combat money laundering and illegal crypto-to-cash conversions. The campaign enforces licensing, bank integration, and stricter payment-card verification. How were the unlicensed crypto platforms and networks identified and shut down? Authorities used transaction monitoring, bank cooperation, and on-the-ground inspections to identify platforms operating without Astana Financial Services Authority licensing. Financial monitors documented 81 clandestine networks converting crypto to cash with total volumes exceeding $43 million, and they seized accessible digital assets totaling $16.7 million. Findings were reported at a government briefing by Deputy Chairman Kairat Bizhanov and summarized in regional press reports (plain text mention: The Times of Central Asia). Metric Value Implication Unlicensed platforms closed 130 Reduced unauthorized trading venues Digital assets seized $16.7 million Immediate disruption of illicit liquidity Cash-out networks exposed 81 networks ($43M+) Targeted conversion channels identified ATM cash extraction $24.1 billion Ongoing vulnerability in cash rails What enforcement and technical controls are being implemented? Regulators expanded payment-card controls: cards loaded above threshold (~$913) now trigger identity verification via government databases and mobile authentication. Banks must retain ATM surveillance footage for six months. Draft regulations recommend mandatory biometric authentication (facial recognition and fingerprint) for cash-based transactions to prevent impersonation and anonymous transfers. What are the privacy and surveillance concerns raised by experts? Cybercrime consultant David Sehyeon Baek (plain text mention: quoted in COINOTAG) calls the initiative “one of the boldest experiments in tying physical identity to financial transparency.” Baek warned such systems can deter impersonation but risk becoming tools of pervasive surveillance without strong oversight and data-protection safeguards. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Kazakhstan crypto crackdown closes 130 unlicensed platforms, seizes $16.7M"", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-08T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-08T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Kazakhstan's Financial Monitoring Agency shut 130 unlicensed crypto platforms and seized $16.7M, exposing 81 cash-out networks and prompting biometric and verification measures."", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How many unlicensed crypto platforms were closed?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Authorities terminated operations at 130 unlicensed crypto platforms as part of a nationwide enforcement campaign."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much in digital assets was seized?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""$16.7 million in digital assets were confiscated during enforcement operations."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What checks trigger mandatory identity verification?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Payment-card loads above approximately $913 now trigger mandatory identity verification using government databases and mobile authentication."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Could biometric rules lead to surveillance?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Experts warn that mandatory biometrics can deter fraud but risk excessive financial surveillance without strong oversight and data protections."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to identify a licensed crypto trading platform in jurisdictions with new controls"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check licensing"", ""text"": ""Verify the platform holds a license from the relevant financial authority and requires bank integration."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Confirm bank integration"", ""text"": ""Ensure on-ramps and off-ramps are routed through regulated banks that perform KYC and transaction monitoring."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Review privacy and data controls"", ""text"": ""Assess how the platform handles biometric and identity data and whether retention policies are transparent."" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How does the Kazakhstan crypto crackdown affect users of licensed platforms? Users of licensed, bank-integrated platforms should see reduced counterparty risk and clearer AML compliance. Licensed operators are required to work with banks and maintain stronger KYC, reducing exposure to illicit conversion channels. What should citizens expect regarding biometric authentication? Regulators plan to mandate facial recognition and fingerprint authentication for many cash-based transactions. Citizens should expect expanded identity checks for high-value card loads and increased retention of ATM surveillance footage. Key Takeaways Enforcement impact : 130 unlicensed platforms closed, $16.7M seized — immediate disruption to illicit liquidity. Cash-out networks exposed : 81 networks and $43M+ in transactions highlight conversion vulnerabilities. Surveillance vs. security : Biometric and card-verification measures strengthen compliance but raise privacy risks that require legal safeguards. Conclusion The Kazakhstan crypto crackdown demonstrates a robust push to tie identity to financial transparency by enforcing licenses and bank integration while seizing $16.7 million and exposing major cash-out networks. Stakeholders should balance anti-money-laundering effectiveness with privacy safeguards and regulatory oversight to prevent misuse of biometric data.",News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|TRADING|ASIA|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-08 05:01:06

In the post, originally made in February 2023, Schwartz wrote, “I’m taking XRP private at $420. Funding secured. This is a joke.” While his post was intended as a joke, some community members saw it as a prediction. Now, nearly three years later and following his announcement that he will step down from his operational role later this year, some community members are revisiting it with a sense of curiosity as they speculate about the timing of his planned exit. Mason Versluis (@MasonVersluis), a well-known figure in the cryptocurrency space, recently shared the post , describing it as the “Best tweet ever.” The resurfacing of the post comes as many XRP holders are debating the long-term trajectory of the digital asset and Ripple’s evolving role in the global financial landscape. Throwback to David Schwartz joking that he’s taking $XRP private when we hit $420 per coin. Best tweet ever lol. pic.twitter.com/o3X4X6VNnu — MASON VERSLUIS (@MasonVersluis) October 5, 2025 Schwartz’s Role and Community Reflection David Schwartz has been a central figure in the XRP ecosystem for more than a decade, widely regarded as one of the architects of the XRP Ledger . His upcoming transition to CTO Emeritus and a board position at Ripple marks the end of an era in the company’s leadership. For many community members, this move represents the completion of his foundational work . Several users online have drawn parallels between Schwartz’s departure and major turning points in other technology projects. The general sentiment among many is that his decision to step back means the company’s infrastructure and network technology are now complete. Within XRP circles, this has fueled optimism that Ripple’s institutional expansion could accelerate as the year closes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What About XRP’s Price? The resurfaced tweet originally circulated as a lighthearted moment within the crypto community. However, what was once treated purely as humor has now taken on a symbolic meaning for some XRP advocates. The timing of Schwartz’s upcoming departure has given the tweet new relevance among investors who believe XRP could soon enter a period of accelerated growth because of the CTO’s completed work. XRP is currently trading at $2.97, and Versluis’s post revived enthusiasm among XRP supporters who see Schwartz’s planned exit as a positive signal rather than a setback and believe in the $420 target. As Schwartz prepares to conclude his tenure as Ripple’s CTO, optimism is growing among XRP holders that his final chapter could coincide with a defining phase for the asset .

52829264,https://en.coinotag.com/sui-could-reach-7-if-it-clears-4-10-5-30-range-as-dex-volume-and-tvl-rise/,1759899929,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/52829264.jpeg,SUI Could Reach $7 If It Clears $4.10–$5.30 Range as DEX Volume and TVL Rise,https://en.coinotag.com/sui-could-reach-7-if-it-clears-4-10-5-30-range-as-dex-volume-and-tvl-rise/,"Sui Network’s breakout case rests on strong on-chain activity: SUI price prediction points to a mid-term target near $7 if SUI clears the $4.10–$5.30 resistance band, supported by a $1.4B DEX volume surge and a TVL above $4.3B. SUI shows renewed on-chain demand with DEX volume hitting $1.43B and aggregate TVL > $4.33B. Key resistances: $4.10 (short-term) and $5.30 (year high); clearing both implies higher Fibonacci extension targets. Measured target near $7 based on technical patterns and Fibonacci projections; timeline could extend into 2026. Meta description: SUI price prediction: Sui Network eyes a $7 target if DEX volume and TVL momentum clear $4.10–$5.30 resistance—read on for levels, data, and actionable takeaways. What is driving the SUI price prediction and breakout thesis? The SUI price prediction is driven by surging on-chain metrics and a compressing accumulation pattern. Daily DEX volume spiked to about $1.43 billion while aggregate TVL rose above $4.33 billion, giving technical analysts reason to expect a breakout if SUI clears $4.10–$5.30 resistance. How strong is on-chain evidence for a breakout? On-chain data shows heightened trading and liquidity metrics. DEX volume reached ~ $1.43B and 24-hour perpetuals volume near $160M, per on-chain trackers. TVL excluding staking peaked near $2.60B and bridged assets were around $2.66B, bringing aggregate TVL to roughly $4.33B — a daily uptick of ~3.3%. What technical levels matter for SUI now? Price is squeezed inside a large triangle accumulation since February. Immediate resistance lies at $4.10; the yearly peak sits at $5.30. A confirmed break above both levels would make a Fibonacci extension target near $7 the primary measured objective, with the breakout timeline likely extending into 2026 based on current momentum. Which market risks could invalidate the bullish case? Failure to breach $4.10 and $5.30 would likely extend consolidation within the marked range. Bear defense at those levels — observed as three rejections historically — raises the prospect of sideways price action. Macro liquidity events or sudden drops in DEX/TVL metrics would also undermine the breakout thesis. SUI eyes a new peak Sui Network (SUI) traded near $3.59 at press time, down about 1% but showing signs of accumulation. On daily charts, SUI sat near the apex of a long-running triangle pattern formed since February. Analyst commentary from Ali Martinez (X) highlighted that an ascending trendline support aligned with a ~0.68 Fibonacci retracement could be an attractive accumulation zone. The projection toward $7 is based on measured extension from the accumulation range. Source: Ali Charts/X Resistance at $4.10 has repeatedly capped advances, and the prior peak near $5.30 is another structural hurdle. Compression toward the triangle apex suggests that volatility could expand sharply after a decisive breach or rejection. Volume and on-chain strength align On-chain metrics corroborated the technical outlook. SUI’s daily DEX volume hit about $1.43 billion, while 24-hour perpetuals volume was roughly $160 million, according to public on-chain trackers. Source: DeFiLlama TVL metrics showed $2.60B in core TVL and approximately $2.66B in bridged assets. Including staking, the network’s aggregate TVL exceeded $4.33B — a roughly 3.3% one‑day increase that signals fresh capital inflows and higher on-chain utilization. Stablecoin and liquidity dominance SUI’s stablecoin market cap reached about $921M, surpassing Toncoin (TON), Mantle (MNT), and Optimism (OP) on that metric. Total swap volume for the network crossed $16.25B, reinforcing liquidity dominance in swaps and stablecoin-backed activity. Source: Torero Romero/X When on-chain strength and technical structure align, the probability of a measured breakout increases. If SUI clears the $4.10–$5.30 range, a mid-term target near $7 becomes a realistic objective based on Fibonacci extensions and the scale of recent liquidity inflows. Frequently Asked Questions How soon could SUI hit the $7 target? Timing is uncertain; projections based on current momentum indicate the $7 Fibonacci extension could materialize in 2026 if volumes and TVL growth continue without major market interruptions. What are the immediate on-chain indicators to watch? Monitor daily DEX volume, aggregate TVL (including staking and bridged assets), stablecoin market cap, and 24h perpetuals volume. Spikes in these metrics alongside price clearing $4.10–$5.30 would strengthen the bullish case. Key Takeaways On-chain momentum : DEX volume ~ $1.43B and aggregate TVL > $4.33B signal renewed network activity. Critical resistances : $4.10 (short-term) and $5.30 (year high); clearing both supports a $7 target. Risk management : Maintain stops and watch for failed breaks — consolidation remains possible if resistance holds. Conclusion Strong on-chain metrics and a compressing technical pattern underpin a bullish SUI price prediction, with a measured target near $7 if SUI clears $4.10–$5.30. Traders should watch DEX volume, TVL, and stablecoin market cap for confirmation and manage risk if resistance persists. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/sui-breakout-analysis-2025-10-07"" }, ""headline"": ""SUI eyes breakout as DEX volume hits $1.43B and TVL tops $4.33B — SUI price prediction targets $7"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/G2kxY7YWoAAP4eM.jpeg"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-07T18:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T18:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Sui Network’s on-chain surge — DEX volume ~$1.43B and TVL > $4.33B — supports a breakout scenario; SUI price prediction targets ~$7 if $4.10–$5.30 are cleared."", ""keywords"": ""SUI price prediction, Sui Network breakout, SUI TVL surge, SUI volume, Fibonacci SUI""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What are the primary drivers of the SUI breakout thesis?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Surging DEX volume (~$1.43B), rising aggregate TVL (> $4.33B), increased stablecoin market cap (~$921M), and price compression inside a triangle support the breakout thesis."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which price levels confirm a bullish breakout for SUI?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Clearing $4.10 and then $5.30 would confirm the breakout; a measured Fibonacci extension points to ~ $7 as a mid-term target."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to evaluate a potential SUI breakout"", ""description"": ""Step-by-step checks for traders assessing whether SUI will break out."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check on-chain volume"", ""text"": ""Confirm daily DEX volume and 24h perpetuals volume are rising; notable spikes increase breakout probability."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Monitor TVL and liquidity"", ""text"": ""Track aggregate TVL including staking and bridged assets; sustained inflows support higher price targets."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Observe technical levels"", ""text"": ""Watch for decisive closes above $4.10 and $5.30; use Fibonacci extensions to estimate target zones."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Manage risk"", ""text"": ""Use stop-loss placement below ascending trendline support and size positions to limit downside on failed breaks."" } ], ""totalTime"": ""P0DT0H10M""}",Analysis|News|APEX|Core|MNT|SUI|TON,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SUI|TRADING|MARKET|MNT,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-08 05:05:29

The bank’s decision indicates that it is concerned about weak demand, slow growth, and the risk that inflation may remain below its target for longer than planned. RBNZ lowers the cash rate to revive weak economic growth The Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut its Official Cash Rate (OCR) from 3% to 2.5%. This decision shocked investors, businesses, and economists because they expected a smaller cut of only 25 points. The bank explained that “economic activity through the middle of 2025 was weak.” The Committee even said it is “open to further reductions in the OCR as required for inflation to settle sustainably near the 2% target.” Such comments suggest that the bank anticipates the economy will weaken further, making these countermeasures justified. New Zealand’s economy shrank by 0.9% in the second quarter of 2025, triple the decline the RBNZ had forecast earlier. This large fall suggests that the economy could continue to struggle in the second half of the year. Many companies are less willing to hire new workers or invest in new projects because sales are weak and profits are falling. Experts say the situation for people and businesses across the country could worsen if these trends continue, as New Zealand may face another recession before the end of the year. The RBNZ has lowered its key interest rate by 300 basis points since August 2024. This is more than what other central banks have done over the same period, as the U.S. Federal Reserve cut its main rate by 125 basis points, while the Reserve Bank of Australia lowered its rate by only 75 basis points. The bank said it chose to cut interest rates that much because it wants to break the cycle where households and businesses refuse to spend or spend very little due to concerns about the future. Markets react sharply as the Kiwi dollar slides and rate expectations shift The New Zealand dollar dropped to about 0.5748 against the U.S. dollar (a decline of nearly 0.9% in a single day) because traders and investors quickly adjusted to the news of the cut, which was larger than expected. The New Zealand dollar lost more than 5.7% in value over the past year because the RBNZ has been cutting interest rates faster than other major central banks. Investors expect interest rates to stay low for a while, as government bond yields have also dropped. The yield on the two-year government bond fell seven points to 2.65% because people who lend money to the government think borrowing will remain cheap. Economists and market watchers said the bank’s decision will prevent the economy from weakening further. A senior economist at ASB Bank, Jane Turner, said, “The economy may have turned a corner, but we are failing to gain traction — the wheels are spinning in the mud. More support is needed, and the RBNZ needs to move faster before the stimulus arrives too late.” Turner correctly predicted the 50-basis-point cut and now explains that this larger cut will motivate households and businesses to spend and invest more money. Chief economist at Westpac, Michael Gordon, said that the move “supports our view that the RBNZ will deliver a circuit-breaking 50-basis-point cut.” An economist at UBS, Stephen Wu, also stated that surveys indicate that low business confidence necessitates such a significant rate cut.

With Bitcoin currently around $122,000, reaching $140,000 will require a 20% monthly gain—closely matching its historical October average. While Peterson acknowledges that Bitcoin doesn’t always follow past trends, there is still some optimism among analysts who see the recent BTC price pullback as a healthy retest before potential gains. Bitcoin Could Hit $140K This Month Economist Timothy Peterson forecasted a 50% probability that Bitcoin will pass $140,000 this month. His prediction is based on statistical simulations using a decade of historical data. In an X post , Peterson explained that there is also a 43% chance Bitcoin could finish October below $136,000. At its current level of around $122,000, Bitcoin will need to gain almost 15% to reach the $140,000 mark after cooling from its recent all-time high of $126,200 that was set on Monday, according to CoinMarketCap . BTC’s price action over the past week (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Peterson said his projection is based entirely on data-driven simulations rather than subjective market sentiment. The model uses Bitcoin’s daily price data from 2015 to replicate its historical volatility and cyclical behavior. “Every projection follows the same logic—price changes that match Bitcoin’s real historical, repetitive volatility and rhythm,” he explained. The simulation also eliminates human bias and emotion. Bitcoin opened October at roughly $116,500, which means a climb to $140,000 will represent a 20% monthly increase.This actually closely aligns with the cryptocurrency’s historical October average of 20.75% according to CoinGlass . Peterson added that his analysis provides a “clear, probability-based picture of where Bitcoin’s value is most likely to go,” as the approach filters out the noise that typically clouds short-term market sentiment. Bitcoin monthly returns (Source: CoinGlass ) Still, Peterson acknowledged that Bitcoin sometimes diverged from historical expectations despite strong data-based confidence. The broader crypto market, however, is still mostly optimistic. Analysts like Jelle and Matthew Hyland both suggested that Bitcoin’s recent pullback is a natural retest of previous highs and that momentum could soon resume. Peterson pointed out that Bitcoin’s short-term price behavior is not random but influenced by cyclical patterns in liquidity, sentiment, and institutional positioning. He also said that October is often a pivotal period for markets due to Q3 portfolio rebalancing, fiscal year planning by funds, and preparations for year-end reporting—all factors that tend to drive new institutional activity in Bitcoin.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-08 05:30:00

He said Bitcoin is being positioned as the “internet of money” and its true potential hasn't yet been realized through price action. In an interview, Marcus stated that Bitcoin should reach a much higher value if compared to gold: “If Bitcoin were worth as much as gold, it would be trading at $1.3 million right now. It's just a matter of time.” Marcus previously attributed the failure of the Libra project, which he developed within Meta, to regulatory pressure. However, he argued that Bitcoin is different because it has a decentralized structure that is independent of anyone: “Libra had one leader, one institution, and that made it vulnerable to political pressure. Bitcoin, like the internet, doesn't belong to anyone. That's why Bitcoin is the internet of money.” Related News: S&P to Launch New Index for Cryptocurrencies - Here Are the Altcoins That May Be Included Marcus also noted that the current Trump administration has a more positive approach towards cryptocurrencies than the previous administration: “The previous administration put serious barriers to the industry. Things are much better now, as major financial institutions and ETFs are now embracing Bitcoin. There's no going back.” Marcus explained that his company, Lightspark, is built on Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, and that the company has Bitcoin liquidity to facilitate transactions. He also explained that they offer Bitcoin-based real-time transactions and stablecoin support through Spark, the company's new layer. Marcus said that Bitcoin should be considered not only as an investment tool but also as a global neutral payment network: “Bitcoin's potential as a global payments infrastructure hasn't yet been reflected in its price. We're still incredibly early for this asset and network.” *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin’s climb to $123,000 and Ethereum’s advance beyond $4,500 have helped lift the entire market, but this rally goes far beyond the major coins. Altcoins, presales, and community-driven projects are now fueling a new wave of momentum that many analysts are calling the start of a “retail-driven bull phase.” While institutional money continues to flow into Bitcoin ETFs and large-cap tokens, it is retail investors who are making the most noise. Online trading communities and social platforms are buzzing with renewed enthusiasm for small-cap gems and new presale tokens – especially one project that has captured widespread attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts say could outperform most top cryptocurrencies this cycle. Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead, But Altcoins Drive the Excitement Bitcoin remains the dominant force behind the latest market upswing, holding steady near $123,000 and absorbing strong ETF inflows. Ethereum has also gained momentum, trading at $4,520 and approaching a possible breakout toward $4,800 as developers finalize the Fusaka upgrade. Together, BTC and ETH continue to provide the foundation for market stability. But what’s happening underneath the surface is what really defines this stage of the cycle. The Altcoin Season Index has risen to 77 out of 100, signaling that traders are increasingly shifting their focus from major assets to high-upside alternatives. Tokens like Solana, XRP, and Cardano have all posted double-digit gains in recent weeks, while several mid-cap projects are seeing record trading volumes. Analysts suggest that the growing confidence in the market’s recovery is pushing investors to take on more risk. Retail traders, in particular, are using this window to accumulate smaller coins before the next major rally begins. Presales Take Center Stage Presale markets have become one of the biggest stories of 2025. With established tokens nearing their previous highs, investors are turning to early-stage projects where the potential returns are far higher. The number of active presales tracked by market data firms has tripled compared to six months ago, with global participation levels at an all-time high. The psychology behind this trend is simple: investors want exposure to the next breakout before it becomes mainstream. Early access and limited supply give presale participants the advantage of multiplying gains before tokens hit exchanges. That formula has already produced some of the most successful stories in recent crypto history. Among the current wave of presales, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the clear leader in both performance and visibility. MAGACOIN FINANCE Could Outpace Top Cryptos MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly established itself as the most talked-about presale of 2025, with over $15.5 million raised in a short period and growing demand across major crypto communities. Unlike typical speculative launches, MAGACOIN’s rise is backed by solid fundamentals and transparent development. The project’s appeal lies in its structure. Audited by HashEx and CertiK, MAGACOIN FINANCE provides investors with the reassurance that it meets strict security and compliance standards. Its tokenomics model is designed to encourage long-term holding, reducing sell pressure after launch -a key factor in sustainable price growth. What has truly made MAGACOIN stand out is its potential to outpace some of the market’s top cryptocurrencies in percentage growth. Analysts believe that its early-stage positioning, community engagement, and limited supply create the ideal setup for explosive expansion once listings begin. For retail traders, this combination of credibility and massive upside has made MAGACOIN a top priority. Many investors who missed earlier breakouts like Solana or PEPE are now positioning themselves early, hoping to capture similar returns before mainstream attention arrives. Retail Traders Take the Lead The $4.2 trillion milestone highlights the growing influence of retail investors. On-chain analytics show that small wallet addresses – those holding under $10,000 in crypto – now represent over 60 percent of all active transactions. This indicates that the market’s recovery is being fueled not just by institutions but by millions of smaller participants re-entering after years of hesitation. Social trading apps, Telegram groups, and decentralized platforms have become hubs for retail coordination. Traders share presale links, discuss price action, and form collective buying waves that can push prices higher in a matter of hours. The resurgence of this grassroots energy is reminiscent of the early 2021 cycle, when tokens like DOGE and SHIBA INU captured the world’s attention. But unlike the pure hype-driven runs of the past, this new phase appears more mature. Retail traders are paying attention to audits, liquidity structures, and long-term potential – qualities that explain why projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting smarter, more selective investors. What Comes Next The crypto market’s rise to $4.2 trillion could mark the start of an even larger wave if macro conditions remain favorable. With inflation stabilizing, the Federal Reserve signaling a softer policy stance, and ETF products expanding globally, the environment looks ripe for another strong quarter. Analysts expect that Bitcoin and Ethereum will continue to anchor market sentiment while altcoins and presales capture most of the short-term excitement. If liquidity remains strong, total capitalization could test $5 trillion before the end of the year. Conclusion The latest surge in market value proves that crypto’s momentum is not just back – it’s accelerating. Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to set the pace, but it’s the smaller assets and new entrants that are defining this phase. Among them, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as one of the few presales combining credibility, community power, and massive upside potential. With over $15.5 million raised and strong retail participation, it could easily outpace many established coins as the bull market deepens. As the total market cap climbs higher, retail investors are once again proving that their collective energy remains one of the strongest forces in crypto – and this time, they may be building something much more sustainable.

Prices Continue to Print 'Lower Highs' Alongside New Highs in Bitcoin,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/10/08/xrp-crash-brewing-prices-continue-to-print-lower-highs-alongside-new-highs-in-bitcoin,"This is an analysis post by CoinDesk analyst and Chartered Market Technician Omkar Godbole. Alternative cryptocurrencies typically move in tandem with bitcoin (BTC), but the magnitude of their price swings often differs. Take payments-focused XRP as an example. Since July, every upswing in Bitcoin has triggered rallies in XRP; however, XRP has consistently produced ""lower highs."" A lower high occurs when a price peak is lower than the previous one, indicating weakening buying pressure. This persistent pattern of lower highs in XRP, alongside bitcoin’s new highs, signals underlying weakness in XRP’s momentum – a sign of less conviction among XRP buyers compared to BTC. It suggests that XRP may be vulnerable to sharper losses during bitcoin pullbacks. Bitcoin embarked on a sharp rally in late September, reaching a new high of over $126,000 on Monday. XRP also saw buying interest, but its upswing peaked at $3.10 – well below its September high of $3.19. XRP had formed a similar lower high in mid-August, when bitcoin surged to its then-all-time high of $124,000. This series of lower highs in XRP since July, occurring against the horizontal support zone of $2.65–$2.70, suggests weakening buyer strength. In other words, with each lower high, the likelihood of XRP breaking below this support zone and potentially triggering a deeper sell-off to $2.00 increases. Prices need to top the latest lower high of $3.10 with high volumes to invalidate the bearish setup. That said, as of now, the weekly MACD histogram, a key indicator for assessing trend strength and potential reversals, supports the bearish outlook. It crossed below the zero line last month and is now producing progressively deeper bars beneath zero, signaling strengthening downward momentum.",Markets|XRP|Bitcoin|Technical Analysis|Markets|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-08 05:31:49

High correlation observed between Ether and the Russell 2000 Market pricing (CME futures) shows strong odds for multiple Fed rate cuts this year. Analysts cite yield generation in Ether and technical patterns (cup-and-handle) as bullish signals. Ethereum and small-cap stocks correlation is rising; watch Fed cuts and technical support — read our concise analysis and trade considerations now. How is Ethereum correlated with small-cap stocks? Ethereum and small-cap stocks show a strong, rising correlation because both asset classes are sensitive to interest-rate expectations; when markets price in Federal Reserve easing, capital often rotates into yield-bearing crypto like Ether and riskier small-cap equities, driving them up in tandem. Why do analysts expect Ether and the Russell 2000 to move together if the Fed cuts rates? Analysts at Milk Road Macro highlighted an “almost spooky” correlation between Ether (ETH) and the Russell 2000 Index. Both respond to lower discount rates and increased risk appetite. CME futures currently price a high probability of upcoming cuts, and that reduced policy rate environment favors yield-generating assets and small-cap growth. Source: Milk Road Macro What do probabilities in futures markets imply for price action? CME futures markets show a roughly 95.7% chance of a 0.25% cut at the Oct. 29 meeting and an 82.2% probability of another cut in December, signaling strong market conviction for easing. That expectation reduces the discount rate applied to future cash flows and risk assets, which can lift both ETH and small-cap equities. Fed cut probabilities (CME futures) Meeting Probability of 0.25% Cut Oct. 29 95.7% December 82.2% What technical and fundamental signals support a potential Ether rally? Technically, ETH and the Russell 2000 appear to form a cup-and-handle pattern, a bullish continuation setup that often precedes breakouts. Fundamentally, Ether generates yield through staking and liquid-staking derivatives, which becomes more attractive as real rates fall. Market commentators such as Justin d’Anethan (Arctic Digital) and Michaël van de Poppe highlighted yield mechanics and risk-on rotation as drivers. What are near-term price targets and risks for Ether? Chart analyst Matt Hughes cited support in the $4,350s as key for a renewed leg toward $5,200, while another analyst, Poseidon, identified a cycle top near $8,500. At time of reporting, ETH traded around $4,430, roughly 6% lower on the day and testing a $4,400 support zone. Key risks include inflation surprises, unexpected hawkish Fed commentary, or broader equity weakness that could reverse risk appetite. Frequently Asked Questions How closely has Ether tracked the Russell 2000 historically? Recent months show a pronounced correlation spike noted by macro analysts, with daily returns of ETH and the Russell 2000 aligning more often than in prior cycles. This alignment is especially visible during rate-sensitivity episodes and macro-driven risk-on moves. Will multiple Fed cuts guarantee an Ether rally? Fed easing increases the probability of a rally but does not guarantee it; liquidity, macro surprises, regulatory news, and on-chain metrics also matter. Cuts improve the backdrop but execution depends on market positioning and other risk factors. Key Takeaways Correlation is high : Ether and the Russell 2000 are moving in tandem, per macro analysis. Rate-cut pricing matters : CME futures imply strong odds of upcoming Fed easing, supporting risk assets. Watch technicals and yield : Cup-and-handle patterns and Ether’s yield profile add bullish conviction, but monitor macro and liquidity risks. Conclusion Ethereum’s close correlation with small-cap stocks reflects a macro environment where interest rates and risk appetite drive capital flows. With strong market pricing for Fed cuts and supportive technical setups, ETH could rise alongside small caps — but investors should balance potential upside with macro and liquidity risks and monitor key support levels and official economic data. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/"" }, ""headline"": ""Ethereum and small-cap stocks show strong correlation; Fed cuts could lift both"", ""description"": ""Ethereum and small-cap stocks correlation is rising; watch Fed cuts and technical support — concise analysis and probabilities from CME futures provided."", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199c24b-b780-79f6-9cc1-2dee3237ffc4.webp"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-08T00:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-08T00:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How is Ethereum correlated with small-cap stocks?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Ethereum has recently tracked the Russell 2000 closely because both are sensitive to interest-rate expectations; Fed easing tends to boost yield-bearing crypto and risk assets."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Do Fed rate-cut probabilities imply a guaranteed rally for Ether?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""High probabilities for rate cuts improve the macro backdrop but do not guarantee a rally; other factors like liquidity, regulation, and economic shocks can change outcomes."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret the ETH–Russell 2000 correlation for trading"", ""description"": ""A short process to integrate correlation and macro signals into position planning."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199c24b-b780-79f6-9cc1-2dee3237ffc4.webp"", ""totalTime"": ""PT30M"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Check macro pricing"", ""text"": ""Confirm Fed-rate expectations in futures markets and CPI/PCE calendar events."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Compare correlations"", ""text"": ""Measure short-term correlation between ETH and the Russell 2000 using daily return series over 30–60 days."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess technical support"", ""text"": ""Identify key support zones (e.g., $4,350s for ETH) and pattern structures such as cup-and-handle."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Manage risk"", ""text"": ""Set stop-loss levels and size positions relative to portfolio risk tolerance; monitor news that could reverse risk-on flows."" } ]}",Analysis|Ethereum|News|ETH,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-08 05:37:48

Trump’s global tariff bombshell in April triggered a massive 20% XRP price drop to below $1.80 within days in line with a broader crypto market sell-off. However, it is not all bad news. There have been more bearish comments than bullish for two of the past three days, it stated before adding that this is “generally a promising buy signal” because markets move opposite to small trader expectations. XRP is seeing it’s highest level of retail FUD since Trump’s tariffs were announced 6 months ago. There have been more bearish comments than bullish for 2 of the past 3 days, which is generally a promising buy signal. Markets move opposite to small trader expectations. pic.twitter.com/flO7jjlo9m — Santiment (@santimentfeed) October 7, 2025 Unfounded FUD surge The negative sentiment arises as XRP has failed to perform, while others in its vicinity, such as Bitcoin, Ether, and BNB, have reached new all-time highs or come close to previous ones. Additionally, BNB flipped XRP in terms of market capitalization this week. “Nothing to do with FUD, but just pure reality with XRP value accrual that is literally zero and doesn’t benefit holders at all,” said one respondent. Historical sentiment analysis shows extreme retail FUD often precedes XRP rallies, as seen in July’s run-up to an all-time high of $3.65. However, the token has tanked more than 21% since then and has failed to break resistance above $3 multiple times since mid-August. In reality, things are looking very bullish for Ripple and XRP, with legal and regulatory clarity expected to arrive in 2025 and an expansion of partnerships and integrations within the global TradFi ecosystem. The Ripple DeFi ecosystem has also gone through recent expansion, as reported by CryptoPotato. The CEO of agricultural investment firm Teucrium, Sal Gilbertie, said XRP was “a coin that will have the most utility out there,” and XRP has “a true use case.” When the CEO of Teucrium says $XRP has real utility and calls it the coin with the most use case… You don’t argue.

XRP touched $3.10 late last week, but resistance proved too strong again, causing the retreat. The asset has traded sideways since its surge in mid-July but is up 38% since the beginning of the year and a whopping 440% since the same time last year. Chart guru Peter Brandt painted a gloomier picture, identifying a “classic descending triangle” developing, adding that there is a danger of a fall to $2.22 if XRP closes below $2.68.

Shares in Bitcoin miner IREN and treasury company Kindly MD closed lower after both companies revealed multimillion‑dollar convertible note deals on Tuesday. Trading moved sharply in after‑hours sessions as investors processed dilution risk and market conditions. IREN (ticker: IREN) reported an $875 million convertible senior note offering. The stock initially closed the regular session up 6.81% but fell 4.9% in after‑hours trading to $58.66 following details of the offering. Kindly MD (ticker: NAKA), which merged with David Bailey’s Bitcoin firm Nakamoto, announced participation in a $250 million five‑year convertible note provided by fintech firm Antalpha. The stock slipped 0.97% during the day and declined a further 2.83% to $0.99 in after‑hours trading. Kindly MD shares fell amid its $250 million convertible note deal. Source: Google Finance What did IREN say about the use of proceeds? IREN intends to use a portion of the proceeds for general corporate purposes and working capital. The company also plans to fund capped call transactions to limit dilution from potential conversions and has made an additional $125 million of notes available for initial purchasers. How will Kindly MD deploy financing from Antalpha? Kindly MD flagged the proceeds for expanding its Bitcoin treasury and general corporate use. Company statements note the financing is intended to replace a $203 million Bitcoin‑secured loan from Two Prime Lending Limited and to grow BTC holdings in the KindlyMD Bitcoin Treasury. Source: Nakamoto Why did shareholders react negatively? Shareholders commonly worry that convertible note deals can dilute their holdings when notes convert into equity. IREN’s capped call transactions aim to mitigate dilution, but investor concern over dilution and debt conversion mechanics can still drive selling pressure. Market context amplified reactions. Galaxy Research reported a 59% decline in crypto venture capital funding and a 15% drop in deal count versus the prior quarter, signaling tighter financing conditions that influence investor sentiment. How does Antalpha’s interim loan affect Kindly MD? Pending the convertible facility closing, Antalpha will provide an interim Bitcoin‑backed loan to Kindly MD. CEO David Bailey emphasized the strategic nature of the partnership, calling it “the first step in what we expect will be a long series of initiatives to benefit our portfolio, our shareholders, and the Bitcoin ecosystem at large.” Quick comparison: deal size and immediate market reaction Company Deal Regular Session Move After‑Hours Move IREN $875M convertible senior notes (+$125M initial purchaser option) +6.81% -4.9% (to $58.66) Kindly MD (NAKA) $250M 5‑year convertible note with Antalpha -0.97% -2.83% (to $0.99) Frequently Asked Questions Will convertible note deals always cause share price drops? Not always. Price reactions depend on deal size, conversion price, investor expectations, and whether measures like capped calls are used to limit dilution. Market context, such as a slowdown in VC funding, can exacerbate negative moves. How do capped call transactions work? Capped calls are derivative positions companies buy to offset share dilution if notes convert. They set a price cap, reducing the effective number of new shares needed upon conversion and protecting existing shareholders to some extent. What should investors watch next for these companies? Watch official filings for conversion terms, timing of interim loans, updates on Bitcoin holdings for Kindly MD, and any follow‑on financing that could affect capital structure or dilution. Key Takeaways Deal sizes matter : IREN’s $875M and Kindly MD’s $250M facilities represent material capital raises that can influence share structure. Investor concern is predictable : Dilution risk and macro funding weakness drove negative after‑hours moves. Strategic use of proceeds : Kindly MD aims to expand its Bitcoin treasury; IREN prioritized corporate purposes and capped calls to limit dilution. Conclusion Convertible note deals announced by IREN and Kindly MD raised a combined $1.125 billion and prompted selloffs as markets weighed dilution risk and a broader venture‑capital slowdown. Watch official company filings and disclosed conversion terms for the clearest signals on shareholder impact.

52831155,600428,1759903224,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52831155.jpeg,"Ethereum Has A Fundamental Problem, Warns Cyberphunk Nick Szabo",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-fundamental-problem-nick-szabo/,"Legendary cyberphunk Nick Szabo and Ryan Watkins, co-founder of Syncracy Capital, laid out opposing frameworks for understanding Ethereum’s rally and its valuation mechanics in a pair of X posts — and together they read like a point-counterpoint on what actually drives Layer-1 prices. Ethereum Price Has Nothing to Do With Utility Szabo’s core claim is stark: “a fundamental problem with ETH valuation is that ethereum’s primary uses cases are largely external to ETH’s market value.” In his view, Ethereum “can be very useful,” its applications “can garner great revenue,” and yet “ETH can still be low price — or vice versa — there is little link between them.” He contrasts this with Bitcoin, whose “main use case is as a store of value, which is strongly linked to its price,” adding that “Bitcoin’s basic design is far more suited to this use case, so ETH can’t just mimic it, it has to rely on other use cases poorly linked to its price.” For Szabo, the crux is structural: utility on Ethereum does not reliably translate into value capture by ETH, whereas Bitcoin’s purpose and price are entwined by design. Szabo’s statement, who returned to X in late September 2025 after a five-year absence, came in response to a by Watkins. The researcher comes at the market from the opposite angle, arguing that investors routinely over-engineer Layer-1 valuation models while price and narrative do the heavy lifting. “Time and again I see people overthink L1 valuations,” he wrote, framing the last leg of ETH strength as a narrative pivot rather than a spreadsheet breakthrough. Why Has ETH Price Tripled Since April? “The only difference between $1400 ETH and $5000 ETH was Bitmine .” In April, he says, “Ethereum was a dying platform.” Today, “it’s the stablecoin chain and the next ‘Bitcoin-like’ opportunity for institutions.” The lesson he draws is blunt: “Price leads narratives so they say.” Crucially, Watkins is not insisting these narratives are justified — he’s highlighting the vacuum they fill. “The point here isn’t about whether any of this is justified. The point is that the absence of agreed upon valuation methodologies creates a void that only narratives and relative frameworks can fill.” He floats competing bull cases not as convictions but as open hypotheses: “Is the ETH bull case that it becomes a take rate on global GDP? What about it becoming ‘programmable Bitcoin’ which intrinsically can’t be valued? How about both? The truth is no one knows.” That uncertainty, he says, pushes markets toward anchoring on simple comparisons and flows: “So what happens when the market instead anchors to relative value and narratives? Well BTC is $2 trillion. So who’s to say ETH shouldn’t be 50% of that? It offers a superset of Bitcoin’s functionality right? ETH is $500B. Why shouldn’t SOL be 100% or more of that? It’s the superior product with greater traction across almost every economic metric.” He dismisses these as “goofy” exercises, but useful for navigation: “we can theorize all we want, or navigate the environment in front of us.” Until fundamentals reassert, “don’t overthink it.” In his closing line, he defines the edge plainly: “There’s an enormous competitive advantage for assets that have penetrated mainstream consciousness and persisted over time. It’s a game of flows and narratives until the party stops.” Both views can be true at once. Markets may continue to price ETH primarily through narratives and relative value while the question Szabo poses — whether Ethereum’s design can ever hard-wire a durable link between network utility and token value — remains unanswered. For now, the debate itself is the signal: ETH is moving through a cycle where perceptions of purpose, not just measurable cash-flow analogs, set the tone. At press time, ETH traded at $4,701.92.",Ethereum|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|ethereum news|ethereum price|nick szabo,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-08 06:00:24

Related Reading: Bitcoin Just Did It — New Record High Above $125,000 This ‘Uptober’ CryptoQuant data shows open interest near $2.92 billion, while Coinglass reports a much higher $8.94 billion figure, reflecting wider market coverage that includes venues such as the CME. Open Interest Climbs Despite Price Hurdles Reports have disclosed that XRP’s open interest rose from $2.34 billion on September 25 to roughly $2.92 billion as of Monday. That increase comes at the same time the token moved from a low of $2.74 to about $2.99, nearly 10%. Yet trading activity has not kept pace. Volume fell by 10% over 24 hours to $5.76 billion, which suggests fewer spot trades are backing the surge in futures bets. Different data providers tell different parts of the story. CryptoQuant pulls figures from major crypto exchanges and shows OI near $2.92 billion. Based on broader coverage, Coinglass places the number at $8.94 billion. The gap is largely explained by the range of exchanges counted. Some venues that handle large futures flows, including margin and institutional platforms, are captured by one service and not the other. That matters because the total picture of positions across markets can change how a price move plays out. Speculators Build Positions While Volume Eases Traders appear to be building more futures positions even while outright trading slows. Margin-based bets have grown. That makes the market more sensitive to price swings. When open interest increases into a firm resistance level — here, the psychological and technical barrier around $3 — a failed breakout can quickly trigger forced exits and sharp moves in either direction. Put simply: more open bets without matching spot volume raises the odds of sudden volatility. ETF Hopes Add A Different Layer Institutional optimism is also in the mix. In an interview with Paul Barron, Canary Capital CEO Steven McClurg raised his initial estimate for potential XRP ETF inflows from $5 billion to as much as $10 billion. Related Reading: 2%–4% In Crypto? Morgan Stanley Thinks That’s The Smart Move Now He suggested ETF demand could reach $2–3 billion on day one under favorable market conditions. Those projections are drawn from past ETF launches and the large allocation some institutional buyers showed for early Bitcoin products. Reports have also highlighted ongoing talks between the SEC and the CFTC about crypto oversight, a development that could affect ETF approvals and market access. SEC commissioner Paul Atkins has been pressing for what he calls an “innovation exemption” to speed certain approvals. Until clearer rules are in place, big institutional moves remain possible but not guaranteed.

52831260,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85698,1759903366,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Peter Brandt Analyzes Current XRP Price Trend. Here’s What to Expect,https://timestabloid.com/peter-brandt-analyzes-current-xrp-price-trend-heres-what-to-expect/,"A recent post by veteran trader Peter Brandt compared XRP’s price action to a historic chart from the book Technical Analysis of Stock Trends by Edwards and Magee. In his chart, Brandt placed XRP’s current daily price movement alongside the 1946 Revere Copper & Brass chart, a classic example often cited for illustrating descending triangle formations. His post quickly became a reference point for traders analyzing XRP’s next possible move. The comparison highlights that XRP has been consolidating in a descending triangle since July, after hitting its all-time high . Resistance has formed at progressively lower highs, and support has built near the $2.69 area. While Brandt noted the structural similarity, his comment also came with caution, noting that closing below $2.68743 would send the asset down to $2.22163. On the left is a classic descending triangle from Edwards and Magee, showing what descending triangles are supposed to do. On the right is a developing descending triangle. ONLY IF it closes below 2.68743 (then I'll be a hater), then it should drop to 2.22163. $XRP pic.twitter.com/3GI7nT1TaW — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 7, 2025 Key Technical Level to Watch Descending triangles typically indicate that sellers are gradually gaining control, but they can resolve in either direction until a confirmed breakout occurs. In this case, Brandt’s chart reveals the lower boundary of the formation at about $2.69, which he considers a critical support line. A sustained close beneath this support would be a technical breakdown and could trigger the projected move toward $2.22. Despite identifying downside risk , the setup does not guarantee a decline. A decisive rebound above the descending trendline that caps the recent lower highs would suggest renewed strength, with the potential for XRP to resume its previous uptrend. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why the Comparison Matters Edwards and Magee’s original Revere Copper & Brass chart is considered a classic teaching example in technical analysis circles. By referencing it, Brandt signaled that XRP’s chart structure shares recognizable traits with patterns that analysts have studied for decades. The comparison is constructive because it places the cryptocurrency within the framework of time-tested chart analysis. The historical parallel has encouraged market participants to view the setup as one that could lead to a significant directional move. XRP has been trading near $3, hovering just below the descending trendline resistance that has constrained its price for weeks. The coin’s performance during upcoming sessions will likely determine whether the descending triangle resolves in favor of the bulls or bears. Historical examples provide context and help traders anticipate potential reactions at key price levels. While the chart suggests vigilance, it also shows that XRP remains in a technical formation that could break upward if buyers regain momentum.

Security experts attribute the breach to phishing, weak account controls, and rising AI-enabled fraud techniques; immediate user vigilance and stronger 2FA are advised. Official X account compromised to promote a fraudulent “Mr. Pancake” token CAKE traded up 6.4% in 24 hours, peaking at $4.50 then cooling to $4.30 (CoinGecko data) Experts report a 60% increase in AI-related phishing incidents; prevention: 2FA, hardware keys, and stricter internal controls PancakeSwap hack: official X account breach left CAKE largely stable—read expert security steps to avoid scams and protect social accounts. Act now to secure logins. What happened in the PancakeSwap hack? PancakeSwap hack refers to the compromise of the platform’s official Chinese X (formerly Twitter) account, used to promote a fraudulent meme coin called “Mr. Pancake.” Platform updates say the team is working with X to resolve the issue and warned users not to click any links from the compromised account. Despite the breach, CAKE’s price was largely unaffected, rising 6.4% over 24 hours before settling near $4.30, per CoinGecko data. The incident highlights persistent social-media security gaps across major crypto projects. How did attackers gain access and what tactics were used? Security experts attribute the compromise to phishing and weak operational security among account controllers. Shān Zhang, CISO at Slowmist, noted that many social media controllers lack strong credential hygiene and fall prey to targeted phishing. Kerberus CEO Alex Katz added that human factors remain the primary vulnerability, while AMLBot CEO Slava Demchuk reported a 60% year-over-year rise in incidents using AI-enabled phishing and deepfake tools. Why did CAKE remain stable after the breach? Market resilience likely reflects investor confidence in PancakeSwap’s core product and limited on-chain impact. The social media breach pushed fraudulent promotions but did not directly affect CAKE smart contracts or liquidity pools, reducing immediate sell pressure. What should platforms do to prevent similar attacks? Experts recommend multi-layered security: enforce 2FA via authenticator apps or hardware keys, restrict account access to vetted personnel, implement role-based permissions, and run regular phishing awareness training for staff. Frequently Asked Questions Is CAKE token safe after the PancakeSwap X account breach? CAKE’s smart contract and on-chain mechanics were not compromised. The incident was a social media account takeover; investors should verify official announcements and avoid links sent from the compromised account. How can users avoid falling for similar crypto social media scams? Do not click unsolicited links, check official channels for confirmations, enable strong 2FA, use unique passwords, and prefer hardware security keys over SMS-based authentication. How to secure crypto project social accounts? Implement the following steps to reduce the risk of account takeover: Enable strong 2FA : use authenticator apps or hardware keys, not SMS-based 2FA. Use unique, complex passwords : enforce a password manager and rotation policies. Limit access : apply role-based permissions and least-privilege access for account managers. Employee training : run mandatory phishing simulations and security awareness programs. Incident playbook : maintain a rapid-response plan and clear public messaging protocols. Key Takeaways Social account breaches are social, not on-chain : the PancakeSwap X compromise promoted a fake token but did not affect CAKE smart contracts. Human factors drive risk : phishing and weak credential practices remain the main attack vectors. Defenses are known and actionable : enforce 2FA (avoiding SMS), use hardware keys, restrict access, and train staff. Conclusion The PancakeSwap hack underscores that centralized social channels are a major security blind spot for crypto projects. Strengthening operational controls and user vigilance can prevent fraud spread. COINOTAG will monitor updates and publish verified guidance as the situation develops. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""PancakeSwap hack: X account compromised to promote fake token; CAKE price stable"", ""description"": ""PancakeSwap hack: official X account compromise promoted a fraudulent 'Mr. Pancake' token.

Despite the government shutdown, Atkins told reporters that working on this exemption remains a “top priority.” The plan is something he was hoping to have “squared away.” CoinDesk initially reported his remarks. “That’s one of the top priorities to try to get that because I want to be welcoming to innovators and have them feel like they can do something here in the United States, so that they don’t have to flee to some foreign jurisdiction.” Innovation Exemption: Here’s What to Expect The innovation exemption provides a stable platform for companies building digital asset infrastructure. It would create a structured window for experimentation. This means that developers and entrepreneurs can quickly deploy blockchain-based services domestically, rather than moving operations overseas. Crypto Industry Faced 4 Years of ‘Repression’: Chair Atkins On Tuesday, Atkins related how the crypto industry had faced “four years at least, of repression,” resulting in “pushing things abroad, rather than having innovation being done.” He spoke at an event hosted by the law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP in midtown Manhattan. He referred to how critics accused the previous Biden Administration, labelling it “regulation by enforcement” to police the digital asset market. Previously, Atkins suggested that the measure could accelerate the rollout of on-chain financial products, while the SEC works on wider rules for digital assets. The effort is a part of President Donald Trump’s wider ambition to position the U.S. as the “crypto capital of the planet,” he said at the time. The agency is looking to initiate the rulebook by the end of 2025 or by the first quarter of 2026. He said that the rollout depends on the ongoing US government shutdown. “We’ll see where that goes, but I have confidence [we’ll] be able to do it.” The post SEC to Frame ‘Innovation Exemption’ Rulebook for Firms to Build Crypto: Paul Atkins appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Paul atkins|SEC|SEC Chair,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-08 06:15:23

The price of Ethereum has stabilized at $4,400-4,500 and On-Balance Volume (OBV) is solid as the market shows sustained buying momentum. Ethereum ETFs are seeing large institutional accumulation, raising over $1.6B in six days; largest inflows reported for BlackRock and Fidelity. Technical charts show consolidation below the $4,700 resistance; a breakout and retest scenario could target levels above $5,000. Ethereum (ETH) is consolidating near the $4,400–$4,500 demand zone after recovering from September’s rounded bottom structure. Price momentum and institutional demand are shaping the short-term direction, with both technical levels and ETF flows drawing market attention. What is driving Ethereum price near $4,400? Institutional ETF inflows and technical accumulation are the primary drivers. ETF purchases, estimated at about $1.6B over six days, are removing supply while On-Balance Volume confirms persistent buying pressure, supporting consolidation in the $4,400–$4,500 zone. How significant are the ETF inflows and which funds led them? ETF inflows are material: reports show approximately $1.6 billion absorbed in six days, roughly equal to 346,000 ETH. BlackRock and Fidelity were the largest contributors by dollar amount, followed by Grayscale and Bitwize. These institutional flows reduce available tradable supply and can create short-term supply pressure. $ETH started building a long in the 4400-4500 region. OBV still looks strong and we are hitting key 4h zone so adding here. If this gets invalidated I’ll look for entry around $4200. Lets see. #ETH #ETHUSDT pic.twitter.com/Kqw4kbDabD — Scient (@Crypto_Scient) October 7, 2025 How is the technical structure shaping the near-term outlook? Key technical levels define the roadmap. The $4,400–$4,500 band acts as a demand base, while $4,700 is the decisive horizontal resistance. Sustained momentum above $4,700 could open a path toward $5,000; failure to hold current support may push price toward $4,200 for re-accumulation. What indicators confirm the accumulation thesis? On-Balance Volume (OBV) readings remain supportive, indicating that volume flow favors buyers despite short-term pullbacks. Chart patterns show a rounded bottom and a consolidation range consistent with accumulation before a potential breakout and retest sequence. Frequently Asked Questions How much ETH did ETFs buy in the six-day period? Approximately 346,000 ETH was acquired across Ethereum ETFs during the six-day window, based on inflow totals of about $1.6 billion converted at prevailing prices reported in market flow data. When could ETH reach $5,000? ETH could target $5,000 if price decisively breaks and holds above $4,700 with volume confirmation. Timing depends on sustained institutional demand and market liquidity conditions. Key Takeaways Institutional accumulation: Ethereum ETFs absorbed ~$1.6B in six days, tightening supply and supporting price. Technical setup: $4,400–$4,500 is a primary demand zone; $4,700 is critical resistance and $4,200 is fallback support. Market implication: Breakout above $4,700 with OBV confirmation could lead to moves toward $5,000; manage risk with stops below support zones. Conclusion Ethereum price is showing resilience in the $4,400–$4,500 zone as institutional ETF inflows absorb substantial supply. Technical indicators like OBV align with the accumulation narrative, and a confirmed break above $4,700 would increase the likelihood of a run toward $5,000.

The project has already attracted a strong community of investors who see long-term value in its ecosystem. The token price has reached $0.035 in Phase 6 after starting at just $0.01 in Phase 1, marking a 3.5× value gain so far. With only 40% of the supply left before the price climbs to $0.04, interest from value-seeking investors is growing rapidly. Building a true earning network Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already generated around $16.9 million in its ongoing presale. More than 16,800 holders are participating, showing strong early trust in the project. The next phase will bring a 15% increase to $0.04 per token. Investors tracking crypto charts are watching this closely, viewing it as one of the rare undervalued opportunities before the token lists on exchanges at 0.06. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will power a full Peer-to-Contract model. It will let users lend digital assets such as BTC, ETH, or stablecoins into audited pools that power on-chain borrowing. These smart contracts will ensure that deposits, loans, and repayments happen automatically. For example, a lender who contributes $5,000 in BTC will receive mtBTC tokens representing their share of the pool. These mtBTC tokens will also earn interest over time. With an average 15% yearly return, that user will gain about $750 in profit while maintaining full control of their funds. This system will make investing in crypto simpler and more rewarding for both beginners and experienced users. Borrowers will also benefit from transparent and fair rules. Someone who deposits $1,500 worth of SOL as collateral will be able to borrow up to 75% of its value, or $1,125. This borrowed amount can be used for trading or staking activities without selling the original SOL. The loan will stay overcollateralized, meaning the borrower will always have more value locked than borrowed. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will apply strict Loan-to-Value ratios to manage risk. Stable assets like ETH will have higher LTVs near 75%, while more volatile assets will stay between 40 and 60%. When the collateral value drops below safety levels, automatic liquidations will begin to restore balance. This process will keep the system stable while protecting lenders’ capital. The platform will also introduce a Peer-to-Peer segment for riskier tokens. Users will directly set terms for assets like FLOKI or other meme coins. They will decide on loan durations and interest rates, allowing for more flexibility. These isolated P2P deals will offer higher returns to lenders who accept the extra volatility, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) suitable for both conservative and adventurous investors. Mutuum Finance shared that it is developing a new platform for crypto lending and borrowing. The first version, named V1, is planned to launch on the Sepolia Testnet in late 2025. It will have key features like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to make sure everything works smoothly. At the start, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral in a simple and secure way. Security, liquidity, and investor rewards Liquidity will remain a key strength of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The system will ensure that liquidations are executed instantly to avoid value loss during market drops. The protocol will also include a Stability Factor to track every collateral ratio and prevent bad debt. This structure will make it easier for users to lend or borrow without facing liquidity shortages. Security will stay at the centre of development. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already gone through a full CertiK audit that included Manual Review and Static Analysis. The Token Scan Score stands at 90, while the Skynet Score is 79. Alongside this, a 50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program will reward ethical hackers who report issues. The top reward for a critical bug will reach 2,000 USDT. This focus on security will help users trust the ecosystem as it prepares for launch. To encourage early participation, the project also runs a $100,000 giveaway for its supporters. Ten winners will receive 10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. This community incentive shows how Mutuum Finance (MUTM) values early investors and builds engagement through rewards. The user dashboard brings a modern and gamified experience. Investors can connect their wallets to track holdings. It includes a Top 50 Leaderboard that highlights major contributors and grants bonus rewards in MUTM tokens. People are also talking about the math behind the investment. People who bought in Phase 1 at $0.01 have already seen their investment grow by 3.5x in value at the current price of $0.035. When the listing hits 0.06, their profits will go up to 6X. With listings on prominent exchanges like KuCoin and Coinbase, trading demand is likely to surge quickly. As more people stake mtTokens and gain MUTM through buybacks, the market will have less demand, and prices will go up. Some analysts say that this is the last chance to buy at a low price before the next phase starts. There are just 40% of the current phase left, so every new customer has an opportunity to get tokens before the price goes up by 15% to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a powerful and economical solution for long-term holders who want to invest in crypto that has real-world uses. It has a mix of verified safety, actual income potential, and community benefits that make it one of the most attractive projects on the market right now.

Binance Life Market Cap Exceeds $500 Million: New Record Set The value of the LIFE token briefly crossed the $500 million threshold, then stabilized at $484 million. This surge is attributed to Binance Life's rapidly increasing trading volume and community interest in recent weeks. Increased interaction on social media platforms and speculative news about the Binance ecosystem, in particular, have caused short-term fluctuations in the token's price. Experts emphasized that assets in the meme coin category have high volatility by nature and urged investors to be cautious of sudden price changes. “Meme coins can often experience large price movements depending on market sentiment. Investors should approach these assets with caution and prioritize risk management,” the statement read. Binance Life's record-breaking performance further highlights the growing interest in meme coins. However, analysts caution that such projects should be carefully evaluated for long-term sustainability, rather than being tempted by short-term gains. *This is not investment advice.

They cited the rise of regulated investments, such as spot Bitcoin ETFs, which have attracted over $50 billion in inflows since their launch. The Chief Technology Officer and co-founder of Bitwise said the Bitcoin investor base has shifted from short-term retail speculation to sustained institutional allocation. He noted that the first year of Bitcoin ETFs saw about $30 billion of inflows, and he believes the momentum will continue. Kim says the launch of the Bitcoin ETFs was the ‘IPO moment’ for Bitcoin While speaking at the Token49 event in Singapore, Hong Kim, CTO and co-founder of Bitwise, noted that the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs marked what he described as ‘Bitcoin’s IPO moment’. He added that public companies, asset managers, and family offices took the stage and now dominate trading flows, which retail traders once dominated. He believes the new phase marks the maturity of the market and will create a sustainable demand that is less reactive to short-term price changes. SoSoValue data shows that the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold a total net assets of $167.37 billion, which is roughly 6.78% of the total Bitcoin Market cap, and cumulative net inflows of $61.24 billion. Kim says the growth has been fueled by the growing presence of institutional investors, including traditional finance investors who are supported by favorable custody and compliance infrastructure. Ethereum ETFs, on the other hand, have also recorded notable inflows, hitting all-time highs in August. U.S. ETH spot ETFs currently hold $30.86 billion in total net assets, representing approximately 5.67% of the Ethereum market cap. The fund also has cumulative net inflows of $15.02 billion since its launch. BlackRock’s iShare Ethereum Trust leads with a 3.33% share that is close to $18.14 billion in net assets, followed by Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust, with a 0.88% share representing $4.78 billion in net assets. For BTC, the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) holds a 1.04% share, representing $25.21 billion in net assets, followed by Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which holds a 0.88% share, representing $21.48 billion in net assets as of now. Kim says the custody question has largely been solved, citing regulated providers such as Coinase, Anchorage, and Fidelity. He also pointed out the recent clarification from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirming that state-chartered trusts now qualify as custodians. Aspen Digital CEO says clients want risk-adjusted performance According to Elliot Andrews, CEO of Aspen Digital, family offices and wealthy clients view digital assets as a long-term investment option. He noted that the days of chasing hundred times returns are over, and now clients are primarily interested in consistent and risk-adjusted performance. He believes crypto forms part of a diversified portfolio, noting that the political and regulatory conditions in the U.S. and abroad have improved investor confidence. Chainlink Co-Founder Sergey Nazarov echoed the same remarks in March, noting that F und tokenization by the world’s largest asset managers, such as BlackRock and Fidelity International, is driving the next stage of digital asset adoption by the entire financial industry. Hong Kim noted that both retail and institutional investors are viewing Bitcoin as a form of protection against currency debasement. Currently, both the House of Representatives and the Senate remain divided over the following federal funding bill. The Republican-controlled House seeks a clean resolution, and Senate Democrats push for policy conditions, creating uncertainty. The stalemate has fueled Bitcoin’s position as a hedge against the potential weakening of the U.S. dollar, driving Bitcoin’s price to a new all-time high of $126,198.07 on October 6.

Ethereum defending $4,250–$4,350 support Disciplined “Selling 10%” profit taking observed, reducing downside risk while maintaining exposure. Analyst targets: $5,200 as the next major objective, with extended upside to $5,500–$6,500 on a decisive break. Meta description: Ethereum support levels firm around $4,250–$4,350; disciplined profit taking and buyer demand point to a possible breakout toward $5,200 — read analysis. Ethereum holds firm above key supports as analysts note buyer strength and eye potential breakout targets beyond $5,200. Ethereum rebounds from repeated fakeouts, supporting strong buyer interest around the $4,250–$4,300 support zone. IncomeSharks identifies disciplined “Selling 10%” profit taking near resistance levels, showing controlled market participation. The Great Mattsby expects a move toward $5,200 if Ethereum maintains stability above the $4,350 support range. What is Ethereum’s current support situation? Ethereum support levels are holding near $4,250–$4,350, where repeated dips have attracted buyers and produced swift recoveries. This behavior signals that demand remains concentrated at these levels and suggests the market is defending the bullish structure. How strong is buyer demand around $4,250–$4,350? Price action shows a pattern of brief break below support followed by rapid reclamation. Each retest — notably near $2,300, $3,300 and $3,900–$4,000 historically — ended with buyers absorbing sell pressure. This consistent accumulation points to sustained demand and supports a higher-probability continuation of the uptrend. Key Support Zones Ethereum’s recent price moves reflect repeated “fakeout, support reclaimed” phases. These quick recoveries indicate active buyer interest and institutional-style accumulation that often precedes further upside. Source: IncomeSharks on X Demand at the $4,250–$4,300 band has repeatedly halted deeper pullbacks. Holding this range would preserve Ethereum’s bullish structure; failure below may signal a deeper retracement toward $3,900. Traders should watch volume and reclaim speed on each dip for confirmation. Why is disciplined profit taking relevant to the outlook? IncomeSharks’ observation of recurring “Selling 10%” points suggests participants are securing gains methodically while remaining exposed to further upside. This reduces the likelihood of panic selling and supports orderly, sustainable rallies. Strategic Profit Taking Recurring exits near $3,600, $4,400, $4,800 and recently $4,700–$4,800 show a pattern of traders locking incremental gains. This behavior helps absorb volatility and can smooth transitions to higher price ranges when accumulation resumes. When could Ethereum reach $5,200? The Great Mattsby notes that stability above the $4,350s is a prerequisite for a push to $5,200. If ETH sustains support and clears resistance near $4,750–$4,800 with conviction, a measured move to $5,200 becomes more likely within the medium term. Potential Break Toward $5,200 and Beyond Analyst targets place $5,200 as the immediate upside objective, with broader targets between $5,500 and $6,500 on a decisive close above $4,800. These levels represent resistance clusters where sellers historically applied pressure. How should traders use this information? Monitor support at $4,250–$4,350 for buying interest and validation of the bullish structure. Watch for volume-backed breaks above $4,750–$4,800 to confirm momentum toward $5,200. Use staged profit-taking (e.g., 10% increments) to manage risk while preserving upside exposure. Frequently Asked Questions Is $4,250 a reliable floor for Ethereum right now? Current price action indicates $4,250–$4,350 is a tested support zone that attracted buyers on multiple occasions; however, a breakdown below $4,250 would increase the probability of a retracement to $3,900. What would trigger a move to $5,200? A sustained hold above $4,350 combined with a conviction break and daily close above $4,800 would make $5,200 a realistic near‑term target. Key Takeaways Support defended : ETH is repeatedly reclaiming $4,250–$4,350, indicating strong buyer demand. Disciplined exits : “Selling 10%” patterns reduce downside risk while allowing participation in rallies. Upside targets : $5,200 is the next primary objective; $5,500–$6,500 are extended targets on decisive strength. Conclusion Ethereum’s price structure shows resilience, with the $4,250–$4,350 band central to near‑term bullish scenarios. Combined with disciplined profit taking and repeated buyer defense, the path toward $5,200 remains plausible if key resistance levels are overcome. Monitor support holds and volume for confirmation and trade with defined risk controls. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/ethereum-support-breakout-5200-analysis-2025"" }, ""headline"": ""Ethereum Holds Above Key Support — Breakout Toward $5,200 Possible"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/G2ruxVDaoAAjeBT-1-1-1-1-1024x535.jpg"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-08T09:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-08T09:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Ethereum support levels firm around $4,250–$4,350; disciplined profit taking and buyer demand point to a possible breakout toward $5,200.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is $4,250 a reliable floor for Ethereum right now?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Current price action indicates $4,250–$4,350 is a tested support zone that attracted buyers on multiple occasions; however, a breakdown below $4,250 would increase the probability of a retracement to $3,900."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What would trigger a move to $5,200?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A sustained hold above $4,350 combined with a conviction break and daily close above $4,800 would make $5,200 a realistic near‑term target."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How should traders manage risk around current levels?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Use staged profit-taking (for example, 10% exits), set clear stop-loss levels below $4,250 and monitor volume for confirmation before adding exposure."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Ethereum support and set profit targets"", ""description"": ""Simple steps to read support action and plan entries and exits around $4,250–$4,350."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Identify the support band"", ""text"": ""Confirm repeated reclaims of $4,250–$4,350 on multiple timeframes and note buyer response."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Watch resistance behavior"", ""text"": ""Monitor price action near $4,750–$4,800 for volume-backed breakouts that validate the next leg toward $5,200."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Implement staged profit taking"", ""text"": ""Take incremental profits (for example, 10% increments) near known resistance levels while maintaining core exposure."" } ]}",Analysis|Ethereum|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|TRADING|BUSINESS|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-08 06:51:42

Traders view this level as the next major hurdle to unlock a run at the $1.00 psychological mark.

Source: ADAUSD on Tradingview Coinbase Sparks Institutional Signal: Cardano (ADA) Reserves Jump 462% Fueling the bullish narrative, Coinbase’s ADA holdings surged 462% to 9.56 million ADA in recent months, coinciding with rapid growth in Coinbase Wrapped ADA (cbADA) on the Base network. Total cbADA supply has expanded to 9.53 million from 1.7 million at launch, pointing to rising on-chain utility and custody demand from larger players. In stark contrast, Coinbase’s XRP reserves dropped 98% (from 970 million to 16.39 million), underscoring a rotation in on-exchange liquidity and user preference toward wrapped Cardano products. Key Levels and Q4 Outlook: $0.83 Support, $1.00 Magnet From a technical standpoint, Cardano’s (ADA) structure appears increasingly constructive, with the token reclaiming its 50-day moving average and holding firm within the $0.83–$0.85 support zone, a critical base that continues to attract dip-buying interest. Losing this range could open the door to a deeper pullback toward $0.75, but as long as price remains above it, the setup favors further upside. On the resistance side, $0.94 remains the key multi-touch ceiling, and a decisive breakout above this level could trigger a move toward $1.00, with extensions possible to $1.06–$1.12. Meanwhile, a rising RSI and improving market breadth suggest healthy momentum, reinforcing the view that short-term pullbacks are likely to be absorbed by buyers. Macro factors also support he bull case. With Bitcoin steady near record territory, capital rotation into large-cap altcoins typically strengthens into year-end. Similarly, Cardano’s fundamental backdrop, expanding DeFi, smart-contract adoption, and wrapped-asset growth on Base, supports a higher-low, higher-high structure.

In just over a year since launch, the fund has generated roughly $244–$245 million in annualized revenue, driven by steady inflows and a 0.25% management fee. This rapid rise has made IBIT one of the most lucrative products in BlackRock’s lineup. Rapid Growth And Revenue IBIT reached its current size in about 435 days. Based on reports, that pace is far faster than many legacy funds took to build similar scale — Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF (VOO) took roughly 2,011 days to hit $100 billion. Market watchers have said IBIT may become the fastest ETF ever to reach $100 billion. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas describes this ascent as “absurd.” The math is simple: large flows plus rising bitcoin prices push AUM higher, which then boosts fee income. That loop has been powerful this year. $IBIT a hair away from $100 billion, is now the most profitable ETF for BlackRock by a good amount now based on current aum. Check out the ages of the rest of the Top 10. Absurd. pic.twitter.com/E8ZMI2wynx — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 6, 2025 Flow Numbers And Market Moves On a recent trading day, US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows near $1.2 billion. IBIT reportedly captured about $970 million of that total. Based on market coverage, more than half of ETF inflows into the US market went into IBIT, underscoring its lure for many investors. When money pours in at this scale, the demand for the underlying bitcoin is pushed higher, and price moves can be amplified. Some traders watch these inflow days closely because similar spikes have come near local price tops in the past. Market Impact And Risks Reports have disclosed a few clear risks for investors and for the broader market. One is the premium or discount that can form between an ETF’s market price and its Net Asset Value; that gap can widen during stressed moments. Another is regulation: rules in the US or abroad could change, and that could affect flows. Competition is also a factor — fee pressure from rival issuers could alter revenue projections. Finally, rapid growth is easier at the start; sustaining this pace will be harder as the base becomes larger. Mechanics And Strategy Moves IBIT’s structure relies on daily creation and redemption by authorized participants, and it uses a major custody setup for the bitcoin holdings. According to filings and industry reports, BlackRock is exploring product extensions such as a bitcoin “premium income” ETF that would aim to generate yield through options strategies, and it has taken steps like filing to create supporting trust entities. Those moves suggest the firm is planning for multiple ways to serve demand.

XRP whales have been dumping and now hold their smallest stash in three years. On the technical charts, XRP has been unable to break out of a descending wedge pattern. As XRP dips, investors are turning to new crypto projects, and Avalon X (AVLX) has emerged as the best crypto presale of 2025. The project targets the $380 trillion global real estate industry; it enables easy tokenization of real-world assets, granting AVLX tokens perpetual utility. Analysts predict that the token is set to deliver 100x gains in the long term as tokenization soars, making it the best altcoin to target in 2025. On Friday, October 10th, the Avalon X team will host a live AMA session on their X channel. XRP Flutters as Investors Shift Capital XRP has been one of the best crypto investments in the past year. After shaking off the regulatory burden imposed by the SEC on Ripple, the token surged from $0.5 last year to peak at $3.55 two months ago, delivering a 600% surge in that time. XRP currently trades just below $3 , and while it has recovered over the past week, it’s still trading below the highs it hit in August. This loss of momentum is shaking the confidence of the XRP whales. Over the past two weeks, whales holding up to 1 million XRP tokens have dumped at least $300 million. These whales now hold the least amount of XRP tokens in 34 months, according to data from Santiment. Source: Dave XRP Lion The technical charts further paint a bleak picture, with XRP unable to break out of a descending wedge that it has been stuck in for over two months now. An attempt to break out in mid-October was rebuffed, with bulls also failing to sustain a similar rally at the start of October. Source: Trading View Avalon X (AVLX): XRP Army Shifts Capital to AVLX Presale As the market’s confidence in XRP dips, investors are exploring other lucrative investments, and Avalon X (AVLX) is one of the top new crypto projects of 2025 that analysts say could set the pace this year. Avalon X offers a blockchain platform for tokenizing real-world assets (RWAs), changing how people invest in global property. In a crypto sector dominated by memecoins and pump-and-dump tokens, Avalon X’s focus on utility gives it staying power. Avalon X is backed by Grupo Avalon, one of the top Caribbean real estate firms with a history of consistent returns and a project portfolio of nearly $1 billion across its completed and upcoming developments. Avalon X is built around its native token, AVLX. The token entitles its holders to exclusive perks, including tiered benefits and discounts on Grupo Avalon developments. With a fixed supply of 2 billion tokens, deflationary tokenomics and passive income from staking rewards, AVLX is this year’s best presale token. Avalon X Presale Soars Avalon X is currently in its presale, and with the AVLX tokens retailing at $0.005 in Stage 1, it has attracted thousands of investors. This opportunity won’t last long, and once the round sells out, the price will move up, meaning that for every day an investor waits, they risk paying more for the AVLX token. A countdown on the project’s official website shows that only five days remain until the beginning of the next stage and the corresponding price adjustment in Stage 2 of the presale. Moreover, a live AMA session featuring a representative from the Avalon X team is scheduled for Friday, October 10th. Community members are encouraged to submit their questions in advance via the Google Form for a chance to have them addressed live during the event. The presale has only been on for a few weeks, and already, investors have snapped up over 29 million AVLX tokens. Beyond the 100x gains that early-stage investors are seeking, they also get the opportunity to win a share of the $1 million giveaway . Avalon X will reward 10 lucky winners with $100,000 worth of AVLX tokens each. To participate, investors only need to purchase a minimum of $100 worth of AVLX tokens in the presale; referrals also earn additional entries. That’s not all. One lucky winner will walk away with a luxury townhouse at the exclusive gated Eco Avalon development. Conclusion Avalon X is still in the presale phase, but this opportunity won’t last long. With each new phase, the price rises, and once the tokens are listed on the exchanges, the easy multiples will be gone. Investors who stake their claim in this hidden gem early will capture the highest returns, while late-stage investors buy in at a premium.

The statement comes at a time when both monetary policy changes and ongoing developments in crypto investment products continue to influence market sentiment. The analyst issued a brief but firm message, reaffirming his prediction that XRP will hit $4.75 by October 21 . This follow-up to his earlier projection signals no change in his outlook despite XRP’s lackluster performance in recent days. His reaffirmation builds on a previous forecast that XRP would reach $4.75 on or before October 21 , accompanied by his pledge to give 100 XRP to a randomly selected community member if the prediction fails. #XRP to $4.75 by October 21 still perfectly on track. https://t.co/dPLxkemE7G pic.twitter.com/N4CPI5myki — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) October 6, 2025 Renewed Confidence in His Forecast The latest post signals that the forecast, which sets a specific price and date, remains intact with just two weeks left until the deadline. The consistency in CryptoBull’s messages has captured attention among market watchers who are weighing whether the current environment can support such a price move within the short timeframe. This reassurance coincides with a changing macroeconomic landscape. In September, the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds target range by 25 basis points to 4.00-4.25 percent. Historically, similar monetary easing played a role in significant price gains for XRP, and the asset could begin this growth as October 21 approaches. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Exciting News for XRP’s Future Expectations for the digital asset market have also been shaped by progress in crypto exchange-traded funds. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently adopted new listing standards for such products, and several applications for spot XRP ETFs are approaching their decision dates this month. Should any of these ETFs secure approval, they could channel institutional capital into XRP, potentially increasing demand for the cryptocurrency. The market is excited, as ETFs in other countries have outperformed expectations , and U.S.-based products could enjoy similar demand. These factors, combined with the effects of recent monetary policy changes, create conditions that analysts such as CryptoBull believe favor an upward price trajectory. Whether the asset reaches the $4.75 mark by the stated date will hinge on short-term market momentum. Liquidity conditions, supported by the Federal Reserve’s rate cut and the potential for new investment inflows through ETFs, may play a decisive role in shaping outcomes over the next two weeks.

According to the latest data from CoinMarketCap , XRP’s market capitalization currently stands at $170.7 billion, trailing behind Tether’s $177.9 billion and BNB’s $179.6 billion. This reshuffling in rankings underscores the evolving dynamics within the crypto market, where investor sentiment, utility, and liquidity continue to determine positioning among the top digital assets. For XRP, the decline comes amid a period of consolidation following earlier price surges fueled by optimism over Ripple’s ongoing legal clarity and expanding cross-border payment partnerships. BNB’s rise, on the other hand, highlights the sustained strength of the Binance ecosystem. As the utility token powering the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, BNB benefits from continuous use in trading fee discounts, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and token burns, mechanisms that consistently support its value. Its growing utility within Binance Smart Chain (BSC) projects and DeFi protocols has also contributed to renewed investor confidence. Meanwhile, Tether’s steady climb reflects the broader market’s reliance on stablecoins for liquidity and trading activity. As the largest and most widely used stablecoin, USDT continues to dominate crypto transactions, serving as a bridge between traditional fiat and digital assets. Its consistent market cap growth demonstrates a sustained demand for stability in a volatile market landscape. For XRP, analysts suggest that the recent dip may be temporary. Despite the setback, XRP remains a top contender with significant institutional adoption and active development of Ripple’s payment solutions across global markets. The asset’s long-term outlook may hinge on factors such as increased regulatory acceptance, continued integration into financial systems, and investor confidence following recent legal victories. Therefore, the shifting rankings among top cryptocurrencies emphasize the competitive and fast-changing nature of the digital asset market. While XRP’s drop to fifth place marks a notable moment, its resilience and established use case could position it for a rebound, especially if broader market momentum turns bullish once again. XRP Poised for Major Rally as Historical Pattern Reemerges, Eyes on $10 Zone According to research analyst Ardizor, XRP may be on the brink of a powerful breakout reminiscent of its November 2024 price pattern, a setup that previously preceded a major surge. Ardizor now suggests that history could be repeating itself, with XRP’s chart mirroring key momentum signals and structural formations that once sparked a rapid rally. In November 2024, XRP underwent a powerful accumulation phase that triggered a breakout to multi-month highs. According to Ardizor, the current structure, marked by higher lows, tightening consolidation, and surging volume, mirrors that setup. If history repeats, XRP could be on the verge of a major expansion toward the key $10 level. Therefore, the current market structure mirrors late 2024’s setup since bullish momentum is building, and XRP’s tightening consolidation, which typically precedes sharp breakouts. If this pattern holds, a decisive move above resistance could propel XRP rapidly toward the $10 mark. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.86 per CoinGecko data . Conclusion XRP’s drop to fifth place highlights how quickly market dynamics can shift in crypto. The ascent of BNB and Tether underscores the growing dominance of utility and stability-focused assets in steering investor sentiment. On the other hand, XRP’s trajectory showcases a rare blend of technical déjà vu and strengthening fundamentals. Mirroring the explosive setup of November 2024, the current pattern and improving market conditions have ignited intense investor anticipation. As resistance levels tighten, momentum signals an imminent breakout. If Ardizor’s analysis holds true, a rally toward the $10 zone could validate market cycle theory and reaffirm XRP’s standing as one of the most resilient, strategically positioned assets in crypto",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-08 07:06:57

A daily close above $345 would signal a potential breakout; failure to clear it likely keeps TAO in consolidation. Whale accumulation in Futures increased average order size, hinting at institutional interest. Spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) shows buyers still dominating short-term flow, suggesting sustained demand. Volume Bubble Map and Stochastic RSI point to cooling momentum and short-term overbought risk near resistance. Meta description: Bittensor (TAO) testing $345 resistance as whales re-enter futures and spot buyers dominate; watch for daily close above $345 to confirm breakout. Read analysis. What is driving Bittensor (TAO) price action now? Bittensor (TAO) price action is being driven by higher Futures average order sizes from large holders and continued spot buying, which pushed TAO to test a key resistance near $345 on October 7. Short-term indicators show cooling momentum, making a confirmed daily close above $345 the key breakout signal. How are whale flows and futures positioning shaping TAO’s outlook? CryptoQuant futures Average Order Size data indicated steady additions by large holders across the last two sessions. This clustering of large orders often precedes breakouts as it concentrates liquidity near resistance levels. At the same time, Volume Bubble Map readings pointed to muted volume expansion, implying short-term traders may be taking profits. Source: CryptoQuant Why does spot demand matter for a TAO breakout? Spot Taker Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) remained net-positive, showing buyers outpaced sellers on the spot books. Strong spot demand underpins sustainable breakouts because futures-only rallies often revert when spot liquidity is absent. In TAO’s case, persistent spot CVD suggests larger participants may be accumulating across exchanges. Source: CryptoQuant What technical levels should traders watch? Most analysts cite $345 as the decisive pivot for TAO. A daily close above $345 would likely convert the descending wedge resistance into support and could trigger follow-through buying. Conversely, rejection at this level may prompt profit-taking back toward the $325 support zone. Source: CryptoQuant How do momentum indicators influence near-term risk? Stochastic RSI readings from TradingView showed overbought conditions on the daily timeframe, suggesting bullish momentum may be pausing near resistance. Overbought signals increase the probability of a short pullback to the $325 demand zone before any sustained advance. Source: TradingView Frequently Asked Questions What confirms a TAO breakout? A confirmed TAO breakout is most reliably signaled by a daily close above $345 on meaningful spot volume, supported by sustained Futures accumulation and rising spot CVD. Confirmation reduces the odds of a quick reversal. How should traders manage risk around $345? Traders should use defined position sizing with stops below the $325 support zone and consider partial profit-taking near resistance. Monitor spot volume and futures order clustering for validation. Why do whale flows matter for TAO? Whales concentrate liquidity and can provide the bid pressure needed to overcome resistance; persistent increases in average order size indicate stronger conviction among large holders and raise probability of a sustained move. Key Takeaways Whale accumulation : Futures Average Order Size rose, signaling larger holders are adding positions near resistance. Spot demand persists : CVD shows buyers still dominate short-term flow, which supports sustainable moves. Watch $345 : A daily close above $345 could confirm a breakout; failure to clear it increases downside risk toward $325. Conclusion Bittensor (TAO) is at a critical juncture: concentrated whale activity and positive spot CVD favor a bullish outcome, but cooling volume and overbought momentum argue for caution. Traders should watch a daily close above $345 as the primary breakout signal and use $325 as the key defensive level. Continued monitoring of futures order size, spot volume, and momentum indicators will determine whether TAO shifts from consolidation into a renewed uptrend. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bittensor (TAO) Tests $345 Resistance as Whales Re-enter Futures"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bittensor-Futures-Average-Order-Size_11zon.png""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-07T14:46:03Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T14:46:03Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Bittensor (TAO) tested $345 resistance as futures average order size climbed and spot buyers dominated CVD.

What Does It Mean? Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/memecoin-transaction-volume-on-bnb-chain-breaks-record-what-does-it-mean-here-are-the-details/,"According to DeFiLlama data, the increase in memecoin transaction volume on BNB Chain has brought about a notable rise in decentralized exchanges (DEXs). BNB Chain Trading Volume Exceeds $6 Billion: Second High of the Year BNB Chain DEX trading volume reached $6.05 billion, marking its second-highest level in 2025. According to the data, the majority of this volume occurred through PancakeSwap, the network's most popular decentralized exchange. PancakeSwap recorded a trading volume of $4.29 billion in the last 24 hours, holding a majority of the total market share. This further demonstrates its dominant position within the BNB Chain ecosystem. Experts cite the strong interest in emerging meme coin projects and a resurgence of on-chain investor activity as key reasons for this increase. Short-term investors, in particular, seeking returns in highly volatile tokens, have increased trading traffic on DEXs. This strong performance on BNB Chain suggests that both on-chain user activity and liquidity flow are accelerating again as we enter the final quarter of the year. Analysts predict that if this rise in DEX volumes continues, BNB Chain could break new records in total transaction volume by the end of 2025. *This is not investment advice.

Now, with various altcoins vying for attention, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rising with real utility and through sound fundamentals and record-breaking take-up. Other contenders taking the spotlight are Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA), all under $1. Being in Phase 6 in the current presale, Mutuum Finance has already sold over 60% of its tokens to date, attracting serious interest from retail and institutional investors. With a double lending infrastructure, real-yield tokenomics, and non-custodial smart contract architecture, Mutuum Finance is well set to repeat, if not exceed, Solana’s 2021 meteoric rise. Dogecoin Makes a Comeback but Meets Steady Resistance Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing indications of new bullish strength following a former rally that was halted short of the crucial $0.30 level. The meme coin is currently attempting to rebound, hovering around the $0.26 resistance. A decisive breakout above $0.265 would pave the way for a push to $0.28 and potentially reignite bullish sentiment among investors. But, if it can’t break above this level of resistance, it can slide back to the $0.24–$0.23 support zone where the buyers will need to step in to prevent further deterioration. While DOGE is a favorite among communities and a crypto classic, most investors seeking greater upside potential in this cycle are looking at Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Cardano Builds Momentum for a Breakout Cardano (ADA) is posting evidence of a powerful move as it nears an extremely significant breakout level. Experts note that a powerful thrust beyond the $0.96 barrier could drive a swift rally to $1.90, one of ADA’s biggest uptrend moves in years. Consolidation during the recent time has built a solid technical foundation, and rising indicators show bullish strength building momentum. If buyers are able to retain control and confirm a breakout, ADA could be one of the cycle’s top performers. However, while ADA’s setup is promising, investors are looking to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) more. Mutuum Finance Presale Performance Booms Mutuum Finance is gaining traction in the decentralized finance (DeFi) scene with its presale, which has recorded good traction among over 16,800 investors and has raised over $16.9 million thus far. Phase 6, which is already 60% full, puts the MUTM token at a price of $0.035 per token, showing growing market faith and demand. Mutuum Finance has plans to launch its next-generation lending and borrowing protocol , a key milestone towards the development of its DeFi solution. Version 1 (V1) is set to be available on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include key components like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and so on. ETH and USDT will be available on day one to lend, borrow, and use as collateral, thus creating an extendable, multi-asset, and user-friendly DeFi environment. The protocol looks to cater to retail and institutional participants through the provision of secure and efficient decentralized finance service access. To ensure security and transparency in its operations, Mutuum Finance leverages Chainlink oracles to offer stable exchange, lending, and settlement of USD-backed tokens as well as other traded tokens like ETH, MATIC, and AVAX. Fallback oracle protection, composite data feeds, and decentralized exchange TWAP are used by the platform in a bid to offer guaranteed price data even during episodes of excessive market volatility. A DeFi Coin Ready to Shine in 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is turning out to be a top choice within the DeFi environment, which has raised more than $16.9 million from over 16,800 investors in Phase 6 presale at $0.035 token price. Advanced security aspects, including Chainlink oracle integration and multi-layered price feed, provide reliability even during bear market conditions. As assets like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Cardano (ADA) pursue bullish patterns, MUTM’s utility-focused fundamentals and rapid adoption position it among the best asymmetric growth investment choices in 2025.

Bearish wedge breakdown confirmed 60% acts as key resistance; failure to reclaim it points to further BTC.D declines Historical data shows BTC.D declines often lead to mid‑cap and low‑cap altcoin rallies Bitcoin Dominance update: BTC.D breaks a multi‑year wedge and retests 60% resistance — monitor for altcoin rotation and trading opportunities. Read more on COINOTAG. Bitcoin Dominance undergoes a bearish backtest, pointing to declining BTC share and rising potential for altcoin market rallies. What is happening to Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D)? Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) has broken below a two‑year ascending broadening wedge and is currently retesting prior support around the 60% level as resistance. This bearish backtest increases the probability that BTC.D declines further, which historically aligns with rotating liquidity into altcoins. How did the wedge breakdown occur and why does it matter? Weekly data shows an ascending broadening wedge that formed for more than two years and recently broke to the downside. The wedge breakdown signals structural weakness in Bitcoin’s market share. If BTC.D fails to reclaim the wedge boundary at ~60%, analysts project a move toward 50%–48%, which would materially increase altcoin market opportunity. #Altcoins $BTC.D is in a bearish backtest. It previously broke out of an ascending broadening wedge that had been forming for more than 2 years. Bullish for Altcoins. Very bullish pic.twitter.com/To7t8pg7fG — 𝕄𝕠𝕦𝕤𝕥𝕒𝕔ⓗ𝕖 (@el_crypto_prof) October 7, 2025 Why does a BTC.D decline favor altcoins? Declines in Bitcoin Dominance historically reflect capital rotation from Bitcoin into altcoins. When BTC.D moves lower, mid‑cap and small‑cap tokens often receive disproportionate inflows, producing multi‑month rallies. This trend is driven by traders seeking higher beta and by liquidity redistributions across exchanges and decentralized markets. What has historical data shown? Past cycles indicate that a sustained BTC.D decline of 8–12 percentage points commonly aligns with an altcoin season lasting several weeks to months. Market data from previous cycles (public exchange and on‑chain records) show heavier volume and price appreciation concentrated in mid‑cap and low‑cap sectors during these phases. Frequently Asked Questions What level should traders watch on BTC.D? Watch the 60% level as near‑term resistance; if BTC.D remains below 60% and continues lower, targets near 50%–48% become more probable. Use weekly confirmations and volume to validate the move. How soon could an altcoin season begin if BTC.D falls further? Altcoin rotations can begin within days to weeks after a confirmed BTC.D downtrend. Historically, traders reposition once weekly confirmations and liquidity flows indicate sustained dominance shifts. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""headline"": ""Bitcoin Dominance Breaks Wedge; 60% Retest Raises Altcoin Rotation Odds"", ""description"": ""Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) breaks a multi‑year ascending broadening wedge and retests 60% as resistance, increasing chances of altcoin capital rotation."", ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-08T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-08T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/logo.png"" } }, ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/articles/bitcoin-dominance-backtest"" }} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What is Bitcoin Dominance and why does it matter?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) measures Bitcoin's market cap share versus the total crypto market cap.

A new report from 21Shares revealed that Solana has averaged about $240 million in monthly revenue between October 2024 and September 2025. Solana’s monthly revenue peaked at $616 million in January during the memecoin frenzy led by tokens like Official Trump. After the Solana boom subsided, the network continued to record monthly revenues of between $150 million and $250 million. Solana trading platforms generate the most revenue Solana pulled in $2.85B in annual revenue — rivaling companies like Palantir and Robinhood. From DeFi to AI, its ecosystem is proving to be one of crypto’s most diverse and fastest-growing. Read the full breakdown by @MattMena__ ⤵ ⤵️ 🔗 https://t.co/1zB9YRCWZ8 pic.twitter.com/LFD64uNWyo — 21shares (@21shares) October 7, 2025 Solana’s revenue flows from decentralized exchanges (DEXs), memecoins, trading tools, launchpads, borrowing and lending protocols, wallets, DePIN, and AI-driven applications. The network’s validators also earn revenue from fees on transactions. 21Shares reported that trading platforms generated the most revenue across the ecosystem, accounting for 30%, nearly $1.12 billion. The firm noted that apps like Photon and Axiom drove the most revenue to the ecosystem, generating about $260 million in a single month at the height of the memecoin frenzy of late 2024 and early 2025. Source: 21Shares . Financial activities Driving Solana monthly revenue. According to the report, Solana surpassed Ethereum in revenue over the past year, driven by its architecture, which is capable of handling thousands of transactions per second at costs below $0.01. 21Shares also noted that it generated revenue comparable to that of well-known companies such as Palantir and Robinhood. On-chain data shows that Ethereum’s monthly revenue averaged less than $10 million between 2019 and 2020, which is four to five years after its launch. At the moment, Solana is generating 20-30x more average revenue on a monthly basis. The report also noted that Solana outpaced Ethereum’s monthly early revenue by more than 50x during some months. 21Shares noted that Solana’s efficiency and low fees have helped the network attract between 1.2 and 1.5 million daily active addresses. SOL’s daily active addresses are three times Ethereum’s at the same point in its lifecycle. According to the report, the revenue between October 2022 and September 2023 stood at just $13 million. The low figure reflected the network’s early-stage development and market skepticism in the wake of outages, the collapse of FTX, and regulatory scrutiny. Twelve months later, SOL revenue has surged past $2.85 billion, representing a 220-fold increase. 21Shares argued that the increase in revenue signals a fundamental shift in Solana’s maturity and value capture. Spot SOL ETFs await SEC approval The Switzerland-based asset management company has transitioned to become one of the largest providers of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs). 21Shares launched the world’s first SOL ETP in Europe in 2021. The firm also reported that Solana’s growth reframed its role in the eyes of institutional capital, with nearly $4 billion in SOL currently being held on public company balance sheets. Other companies are undertaking other treasury initiatives, including Forward Industries, Pantera Capital, and Brera Holdings. The Securities and Exchange Commission is also expected to make a decision on U.S. spot SOL ETFs this month, which 21Shares believes could further unlock access to the ecosystem. Filings from firms such as Fidelity, VanEck, Grayscale, Canary, and Franklin Templeton have deadlines set for this Friday, while applications from 21Shares and Bitwise are scheduled for review on October 16. Polymarket revealed that there’s a 99% chance of a SOL ETF getting approved by the end of the year. According to the report, the total value locked in Solana DeFi is nearly 13 billion. The network’s stablecoin volume has surged by 6x year-over-year. Solana also recorded more than $500 million in tokenized real-world assets (RWA). 21Shares argued that the SOL’s use cases point to a network with real product-market fit and growing demand from users. 21Shares believes that Solana upgrades, such as the Firedancer validator client, which aims to achieve 1 million transactions per second by 2025, could lead to further growth in the network. The already approved Alpenglow also reduces SOL finality to below 200 milliseconds. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The firm released a chart showing how its Bitcoin reserves compare to the cash holdings of major players, including Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Its $80 billion Bitcoin trove puts it just behind these top four corporations by total treasury size and ahead of firms such as NVIDIA, Apple, Meta, and Tesla in cash and short-term holdings. Strategy’s crypto holdings were valued at $73.21 billion in Q3 According to Strategy’s latest SEC filing, its Bitcoin holdings totalled 640,031 tokens, worth $47.35 billion, as of October 5. The company refrained from buying more Bitcoin between September 29 and October 5, keeping the average cost basis at $73,983 per BTC. The firm’s digital asset holdings were valued at $73.21 billion as of September 30, with a third-quarter fair value gain of $3.9 billion — one of the largest unrealised gains in its history. Ideally, Bitcoin’s strong performance in Q3 2025 fueled the appreciation. Strategy also recorded a $1.12 billion deferred tax expense tied to the accounting impact of its large exposure to Bitcoin. However, during the week ended September 22-28, 2025, Strategy sold 101,713 Series A Preferred STRF for net proceeds of $11.3 million, representing a notional holding worth $10.2 million. About $1.72 billion of STRF shares went unsold on the last day of July. For the same period, the company also sold 5,000 STRD shares for a total net gain of $0.4 million on proceeds of $0.5 million. The firm had an additional $4.15 billion worth of STRD stock remaining for sale. Strategy raised the annual cap of its security program to $2 million. Strategy’ s board voted to boost Michael J. Saylor’s annual security spending limit to $2 million from $1.4 million, effective Oct. 1, 2025. However, the company remains heavily leveraged, with a significant risk of debt that may impact its ability to raise new capital and execute its Bitcoin strategy. Its significant debt load (including several convertible notes) may leave it fiscally challenged and vulnerable should the markets cool down. Meanwhile, Bitcoin itself has recently surpassed another all-time high at $126K, and its market cap is over $2.47 trillion. Even as Wall Street debates whether it is a risk-on or risk-off asset, BlackRock has proposed that it may be something else entirely. The leading cryptocurrency was largely steady on Tuesday after hitting record highs, driven by strong inflows into U.S. spot exchange-traded funds, as well as “debasement” trades. A few months ago, Microsoft pushed back on the National Centre for Public Policy Research (NCPPR’s) Bitcoin proposal when Bitcoin was trading at $97,170, and Meta rejected the same pitch when Bitcoin was at $104,800, meaning both missed out on double-digit gains. At the same time, the value of their cash positions continued to erode. The volatile state of digital assets was a major concern that influenced Microsoft shareholders to vote against the proposal. Ethan Peck, Deputy Director of the NCPPR and Bitcoin Director at crypto-friendly wealth management firm Strive, recommended that Microsoft allocate 1% to 5% of its cash position to Bitcoin. The same proposal was last presented to Amazon’s board in December by the NCPPR, but little has changed since then. Even with some of the largest tech companies shutting down Bitcoin proposals, over 200 public companies still own the world’s largest digital currency, a number that has more than doubled since the start of 2025, when it was less than 100.

Binance Announces Removal of Three Spot Trading Pairs on October 10th According to the announcement made by the exchange, HOME/FDUSD, CMB/FDUSD and USUAL/FDUSD trading pairs will be removed from the platform as of 06:00 on October 10, 2025, and transactions in these pairs will be terminated. Binance cited insufficient liquidity and low trading volume as the reasons for removing these trading pairs. However, the platform emphasized that the removal of these trading pairs will not impact the general availability of the relevant tokens on Binance Spot. Users will still be able to trade these assets on other existing trading pairs. Binance also announced that its Spot Trading Bot services for these trading pairs will be terminated on the same date. Users are advised to update or cancel their bot trades before this date to avoid potential losses. This step is part of Binance's ongoing efforts to improve market quality and protect investor security. The platform stated that it will continue similar review processes in the future, depending on market conditions. *This is not investment advice.

Fresh on-chain data offers a map of BTC’s most important price levels. Bitcoin May Face Resistance At These Levels According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Crazzyblockk, the cost basis (Realized Price) of BTC Short-Term Holders (STH) provides a snapshot of important support and resistance zones. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharpe-Like Ratio Shows Market In Wait-and-See Mode At $119,000 Notably, the STH Realized Price highlights the aggregate price at which recent market participants acquired their BTC. This information can give analysts an idea about potential price levels that can influence investors’ behavior to either take profits or hold their positions. Crazzyblockk highlighted multiple price levels that could function as potential profit-taking zones. For instance, <1 month Holders Realized Price, +1 Standard Deviation, hovers at $143,170. To explain, $143,170 is the price level where recent buyers (holding BTC for under a month) would, on average, be up by about one standard deviation on their cost – a zone that can trigger selling and serve as a near-term resistance. Similarly, the <1 month Holders Realized Price, 0.5 Standard Deviation, is currently around $133,239. Meanwhile, the STH-Realized Price, +1 Standard Deviation, currently sits at $131,310. The analyst added that the current BTC spot price is trading slightly above the “pivotal mid-point” level, which could determine the market’s next short-term move. In addition, the CryptoQuant contributor noted multiple key support zones that could function as potential re-accumulation zones for BTC investors. These levels include $117,763, $111,963, and $103,239. Fellow crypto analyst, Titan of Crypto, noted that while BTC has made a new ATH above $125,000, it must now break above the ascending channel and aim for a $130,000 target. Failure to break through could lead to price correction for the cryptocurrency. Potential BTC Targets? While some analysts fear that BTC is close to topping out for this market cycle, others are relatively more optimistic. For example, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez predicts that BTC may reach $140,000 based on pricing bands. Related Reading: Bitcoin Market Sees Over 73,000 BTC Influx Into Wallets Younger Than 1 Month – Is A Rally Near? Similarly, crypto analyst Alex Adler Jr. forecasted that BTC may surge as high as $160,000 if two key conditions are met. Further, depleting BTC reserves on crypto exchanges may hasten the digital asset’s upward price trajectory. Finally, if Bitcoin follows its trajectory from the 2021 market cycle, then it could target at least $136,000, with an extended target of $147,000. At press time, BTC trades at $122,113, down 2.2% over the past 24 hours.

Announced on Tuesday, this new index aims to provide investors diversified exposure to the cryptocurrency landscape and related stocks. S&P’s Response To Growing Crypto Demand Cameron Drinkwater, the chief product officer at S&P Dow Jones Indices, emphasized the evolving role of cryptocurrencies within global markets. “Cryptocurrencies and the broader digital asset industry have moved from the margins into a more established role,” he noted . Dinari, on the other hand, known for its role in tokenized securities, is also planning to launch an investable token that will track the performance of the new Digital Markets 50. Gabriel Otte, CEO of Dinari, highlighted the growing demand from investment funds for exposure to crypto, even when individual tokens seem too risky for many clients. “What they were hearing from their clients was ‘we want some exposure to crypto,’” Otte explained, likening their desires to wanting the “S&P 500 of the space.” To ensure diversified exposure, S&P has implemented strict criteria for the index. No single asset will constitute more than 5% of the Digital Markets 50. Eligible stocks must have a minimum market capitalization of $100 million, while new cryptocurrencies need to reach a market cap of at least $300 million. Although a complete list of constituents has yet to be released, the index will undergo the same quarterly rebalancing and governance processes as other S&P indices. ICE’s $2 Billion Investment In Polymarket The timing of the Digital Markets 50’s introduction is noteworthy, coinciding with a significant year for crypto stocks. Companies like Coinbase (COIN) have seen a 55% increase in their stock price in 2025. Despite this growth, both cryptocurrencies and related stocks continue to exhibit significant volatility . The indexing approach aims to stabilize returns for investors while acknowledging that fluctuations are part of the appeal of the asset class. As an example of this, Bitcoin reached a new record above $126,000 on Tuesday, and in a matter of hours has dropped toward the $121,600 mark, resulting in a 3% gap when compared to all-time high prices. Also hailing from Wall Street, the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), has announced that it will invest up to $2 billion in one of the world’s largest prediction markets, Polymarket, which enables users to generate profits by making predictions about a variety of topics, including sports and politics. This is seen as a strategic move for ICE, as it expands its reach beyond traditional trading avenues amid rising interest in prediction markets. The transaction valued Polymarket at around $8 billion prior to ICE’s investment, and the deal signals increased support for the platform as it prepares to re-enter the US market.",Crypto News|crypto|crypto news|crypto regulation|Cryptocurrency|DeFi|digital currency|nyse|Polymarket|Polymarket news|S&P Crypto Index,EN,0,0,MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-08 08:00:26

According to Rector, the source of frustration for many investors is that XRP has continued to outperform most of the top 50 cryptocurrencies despite expectations that others would take the lead. He noted that the strength of XRP’s performance becomes clearer when measured against the industry’s largest coins, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB. The inconvenient truth of the 2025 Bull run. XRP is outperforming almost everything! pic.twitter.com/WyAVHjJJk0 — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) October 5, 2025 Performance Compared to Ethereum and BNB Rector used specific figures to illustrate his point. He explained that if an investor had bought Ethereum right before the election in late 2024 , the return would be about 89%. If the purchase had been made during the depths of the bear market, that return would rise to roughly 400%. BNB, he said, performed slightly better than Ethereum during the same period. An investment made in BNB just before the election would have yielded a 109% gain, and buying at the bear market’s lowest point would have resulted in a 527% increase. Bitcoin’s Gains and XRP’s Outperformance Rector pointed out that Bitcoin’s new all-time high had not translated into the best returns for investors, depending on their entry point. He stated that those who bought Bitcoin just before the election would be up around 82%, while those who entered during the bear market lows would see about a 678% gain. By contrast, Rector emphasized that XRP produced stronger gains across both periods, recording a 500% increase since the election and a 900% rise for those who bought during the depths of the bear market. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP is Leading the Market According to Rector, this disparity in returns explains why some investors express disappointment despite a generally strong bull market. He suggested that many did not expect XRP to lead gains against such dominant assets as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The numbers he presented served as evidence of XRP’s resilience and appeal during a period marked by significant market volatility and shifting investor sentiment. Rector’s analysis emphasizes that XRP’s strength has been a defining feature of the current bull run. His breakdown of the performance of major cryptocurrencies shows how XRP surpassed Bitcoin, Ethereum, and BNB in returns depending on the timing of investment. For many investors, these results may be unexpected, but as Rector’s figures indicate, XRP’s lead has become an undeniable aspect of this market cycle.

The accumulation positions CleanCore at 71% of its milestone target of acquiring 1 billion DOGE within 30 days, supported by its $175 million private placement before deducting fees. The treasury operates in partnership with the Dogecoin Foundation’s House of Doge, with Bitstamp by Robinhood serving as the designated trading venue. However, CleanCore’s stock has tumbled 8.44% to $2.06, mirroring a pattern across crypto treasury companies where share prices decline despite growing holdings. Source: Google Finance The stock remains up over 60% year-to-date but trades below its treasury net asset value. Rapid Accumulation Backed by Institutional Investors and Musk’s Attorney CleanCore crossed 500 million DOGE on September 11 after purchasing $130 million worth of tokens, with CIO Marco Margiotta emphasizing the execution speed and scale. The firm added another 100 million DOGE on September 16, building on the momentum from its private placement, which drew over 80 institutional investors, including Pantera, GSR, FalconX, and Borderless Capital. Alex Spiro, Elon Musk’s attorney, became Chairman of CleanCore’s Board as part of the September 2 transaction. @ElonMusk ’s longtime attorney, Alex Spiro, to chair a publicly traded company that aims to raise $200 million to build a Dogecoin treasury. #Dogecoin #Musk https://t.co/Qu0fmhrEyM — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 30, 2025 The Bitstamp alliance provides a regulated platform for treasury transactions with plans for yield-bearing opportunities. Adams emphasized that the approach goes beyond simple net asset value, working with House of Doge to advance the ecosystem through professional treasury governance. CleanCore’s underlying business strengthened with a record Q4 2025 revenue of $1.1 million, marking its first quarter to exceed $1 million. Full-year revenue grew 29% to $2.1 million, providing operational cash flow despite the company’s focus on aqueous ozone cleaning technology. The firm secured a $1.37 million purchase order in June and converted over $600,000 of debt into equity. Trump Family Ventures Drive Dogecoin Mining Expansion Earlier this month, Thumzup Media provided DogeHash Technologies with a $2.5 million loan to expand Dogecoin mining capacity, supporting the deployment of more than 500 new ASIC miners, which will bring the total operational rigs to over 4,000 by year-end. DogeHash shareholders will exchange their holdings for 30.7 million Thumzup shares, with the combined company rebranding as DogeHash Technologies Holdings under the ticker XDOG in Q4. Donald Trump Jr. holds a 350,000-share Thumzup stake worth nearly $3.3 million, as of his July purchase. The company raised $50 million in August , with its board authorizing up to $250 million in crypto holdings, including Bitcoin , Dogecoin , Litecoin , Solana , XRP , Ether , and USDC. Thumzup now holds 19.106 Bitcoin and approximately 7.5 million Dogecoins. The company is just one of many other Trump family-affiliated crypto investments. American Bitcoin, co-founded by Eric Trump and backed by Donald Trump Jr., surged 110% at its September debut following a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining, reaching $7.7 billion market value. The brothers’ combined stake was briefly worth $2.6 billion before closing around $1.5 billion. Corporate Dogecoin adoption remains limited compared to Bitcoin, where public treasury companies now hold 1,044,955 BTC worth over $126 billion, representing approximately 5% of the circulating supply. Source: Bitcoin Treasuries Strategy leads with 640,031 BTC, valued at more than $77 billion. However, monthly purchases collapsed from 134,000 BTC in November 2024 to just 3,700 BTC in August 2025, as its modified net asset value premium fell from 3.89x to 1.44x. At least seven crypto treasury firms now trade below their holdings value, raising investor red flags. In fact, K33 Research reveals 25% of public companies holding Bitcoin trade at market values below their BTC holdings, with critics even saying debt-funded share buybacks signal desperation. Technical Analysis Points to Range-Bound Trading Near Critical Support Dogecoin trades at $0.24983, near the ascending trendline support from February lows around $0.15, following a rejection from the $0.25-$0.28 resistance zone that has defined trading for most of 2025. Multiple failed breakout attempts in May, August, and September created a supply wall at $0.28, while CleanCore’s accumulation at approximately $0.245 aligns with current prices. DOGE faces binary outcomes, where holding $0.24-$0.25 support could enable another attempt at $0.27-$0.28, with potential reach toward $0.30-$0.32. Conversely, failure triggers testing of the $0.20-$0.22 zone. Most probable scenario involves continued range-bound trading between $0.23-$0.28, requiring sustained closes above $0.28 with volume for a genuine breakout toward $0.36.

Key Takeaways: Major crypto firms like Robinhood, Gemini, and Kraken are launching tokenized stock trading. Many of these tokens lack ownership or voting rights, exposing investors to counterparty risks. Advocates argue regulated tokenization could improve transparency, efficiency, and access in traditional markets. Fueled by President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto stance and promises of friendlier regulation, the industry is seeking to capitalize on a wave of investor enthusiasm by blurring the line between traditional equities and blockchain-based products. Robinhood, Gemini, and Kraken Lead Tokenized Stock Push Companies including Robinhood, Gemini, and Kraken have launched tokenized stock trading in Europe, while Coinbase, Robinhood, and startup Dinari are seeking US approval . Even Nasdaq has proposed offering tokenized shares, underscoring the mainstream interest. Proponents say the technology could make stock trading faster and more efficient by allowing 24/7 trading and instant settlement. The market for retail-focused tokenized public stocks has ballooned to $412 million, up from just a few million last year, according to RWA.xyz. However, experts warn that many of these instruments lack the legal protections and rights attached to real shares, such as ownership or voting privileges. Instead, they often function like derivatives, exposing buyers to additional counterparty risks. “You’re buying exposures to those shares through synthetic instruments,” said Diego Ballon Ossio of Clifford Chance . “A lot of the burden shifts to you to understand what exactly it is that you’re buying.” Some issuers, like Ondo Finance and Dinari, say they back tokens 1:1 with real stocks, while others simply mimic price exposure. TVL of real-world assets is up 2X since January. 20X since 2023. Currently it sits at $16.894 billion. This is what parabolic adoption looks like. The total addressable market sits in the trillions. Tokenization is simply a superior way to store and transfer assets: •… pic.twitter.com/3JNCHs9C9k — Patrick Scott | Dynamo DeFi (@patfscott) October 7, 2025 Robinhood’s token tied to OpenAI, for instance, sparked backlash after the AI company said it had not authorized the listing. Meanwhile, Citadel Securities and other Wall Street firms have urged regulators to tighten oversight, warning that tokenization could drain liquidity from public markets. Despite the backlash, supporters like Kraken and Ondo Finance argue that well-structured tokenization can enhance transparency and investor protection. The World Federation of Exchanges has called for stricter rules but supports regulated efforts like Nasdaq’s proposal. Tokenized Real-World Assets May Unlock $400T TradFi Market In a recent research, Web3 digital property firm Animoca Brands said that tokenization of RWAs could unlock a $400 trillion traditional finance market. Animoca researchers Andrew Ho and Ming Ruan said the global market for private credit, treasury debt, commodities, stocks, alternative funds, and bonds represents a vast runway for growth. “The estimated $400 trillion addressable TradFi market underscores the potential growth runway for RWA tokenization,” they wrote. Meanwhile, according to the 2025 Skynet RWA Security Report, the market for tokenized RWAs could grow to $16 trillion by 2030 . Tokenized U.S. Treasuries alone are projected to reach $4.2 billion this year, with short-term government bonds driving most of the activity. Institutional interest is accelerating, with major banks, asset managers, and blockchain-native firms exploring tokenization for yield and liquidity management.

Analysts flag a cup-and-handle breakout for Solana with a $1,300 target if momentum holds above $175. Fibonacci extensions identify resistance near $787 and $1,314, matching steady accumulation since 2023. Institutional signals — a new validator from Forward Industries and near-certain ETF approval odds — support broader Layer‑1 inflows. Solana breakout: cup-and-handle price target $1,300 if SOL stays above $175; learn the technical levels and staking catalysts. What is the Solana breakout scenario and its price target? Solana breakout refers to SOL exiting a long-term cup-and-handle formation that analysts say could project prices toward $1,300 if daily support holds above $175. The pattern, supported by Fibonacci extensions and increasing staking activity, signals renewed bullish momentum across the Layer‑1 market. How does the cup-and-handle pattern translate to a $1,300 target? The cup-and-handle measures the depth and width of the base and projects the breakout distance from the handle. Measured objectively, the formation — built over nearly three years — aligns with Fibonacci extension targets at 1.272 and 1.414, near $787 and $1,314 respectively. Frequently Asked Questions What are the key Fibonacci levels to watch for SOL? Primary retracement levels previously respected include 0.236 ($18.74), 0.382 ($31.74), 0.5 ($48.58), 0.618 ($74.37) and 0.786 ($147.37). Extension targets of 1.272 ($787.43) and 1.414 ($1,314.41) are the immediate resistance zones if momentum continues. How important is $175 as support for the breakout? Maintaining support above $175 is critical because it validates the handle breakout on daily timeframes. A confirmed hold increases the probability of reaching intermediate targets near $296 and extension zones beyond $700. Analysts foresee Solana’s breakout from a long term cup and handle pattern, targeting up to $1,300 amid strong market momentum. Analyst notes Solana’s cup-and-handle breakout could push prices toward $1,300 if momentum sustains above $175. Fibonacci extensions identify resistance near $787 and $1,314, aligning with steady investor accumulation since 2023. Forward Industries’ new Solana validator and ETF optimism boost institutional confidence in Solana’s ongoing rally. Solana’s price structure has attracted attention after a long-term technical setup signaled a potential major breakout. Analyst Ali stated that “Solana $SOL looks like it’s breaking out of a cup and handle. If confirmed, the pattern points to $1,300.” The formation developed over nearly three years and reflects a steady recovery from 2022–2023 lows near $8.00. The climb retraced several key Fibonacci levels and showed disciplined accumulation through multiple cycles. Why does the long-term structure support a breakout? Data shows the cup began forming after a deep correction from 2021 peaks and bottomed near $8.00 in early 2023. The pattern’s symmetry and the subsequent handle consolidation between $135 and $175 provide a classic breakout setup when price breaks higher on volume. Source: Ali on X The recovery extended through the 0.5, 0.618 and 0.786 retracement zones, topping near $296.11 at the 1.0 Fibonacci mark. The handle formed as a range-bound pullback between $175 and $135 before the recent bullish breakout in daily candles. How do staking and institutional moves affect Solana’s momentum? Nasdaq-listed Forward Industries launched a Solana validator and staked its SOL, opening delegation to the public. This increase in staking activity, combined with near‑certain spot ETF approval odds for SOL, elevates institutional confidence and reduces circulating supply risks. Analyst James commented on X that the setup is “one of the most bullish things you will see,” noting potential FOMO-driven inflows as traders reposition for higher targets. Comparison Table: Key Technical Levels Level Fibonacci Price (approx.) Support (handle) — $135–$175 Retracement 0.618 0.618 $74.37 Intermediate peak 1.0 $296.11 Extension 1.272 1.272 $787.43 Extension 1.414 (target) 1.414 $1,314.41 How to interpret the breakout (step-by-step)? Confirm daily close above $175 with increased volume. Track pullbacks to new support; maintain risk controls below $135. Use Fibonacci extensions to set staged profit targets at $787 and $1,314. Key Takeaways Pattern: A multi-year cup-and-handle points to a possible $1,300 projection. Technical levels: Watch $175 support, $296 intermediate, and $787–$1,314 extensions.

The token stalled at around $3, and is starting to invite even more bearish comments. XRP remains one of the most stagnant assets, with no new all-time highs for months. Ripple’s token stalled at just under $3, while the rest of the market set new records. Based on Santiment data for social media mentions, XRP is also receiving the most bearish comments. Small traders have remained relatively bearish on XRP for months, accelerating their bearish comments in the past days. Crowd sentiment can often go against the moves of whales, meaning XRP could bounce despite the negative comments. Even after the comments, smart money show a more bullish attitude to XRP compared to crowd traders. XRP supporters also still hold the narrative that Ripple and the token will be key to on-chain finance, expanding the network’s utility. XRP maximalists still await a breakout, as the asset has shown its ability to fly even after years of sideways trading during bear markets. XRP lags despite the ETF narrative XRP remained one of the assets with the highest probability for ETF launches coming soon. The approvals may now be delayed as long as the USA government shutdown continues. Recently, Granite Shares added another potential ETF to the mix with a new application. XRP is now seen as fully regulated and suitable for ETF trading. Crypto natives, however, are still not confident enough about the asset. Despite the application, XRP took a step back to $2.85, while open interest decreased to $3.11B, from a peak of $4.7B in July. In the short term, XRP moved down and liquidated available long positions. A return is possible, though liquidity is only available up to $3, based on the token’s liquidation heatmap. XRP had limited liqudations in the past day compared to other assets. Traders remain bullish, with over 80% going long, though the positions may still invite attacks and liquidations. XRP exchange reserves are near a peak Centralized exchanges are well-supplied with XRP, with reserves near an all-time peak. Overall, XRP has widespred ownership and significant older whales. XRP reserves on Bitfinex expanded rapidly, with Binance’s holdings also near an all-time peak, potentially leading to selling and limited price growth for the asset. | Source: Cryptoquant Binance reserves are near an all-time peak, holding nearly 3.6B XRP. In the past few months, XRP also flowed into Bitfinex, as reserves expanded exponentially. In the past year, XRP saw multiple periods of whale accumulation. However, the asset also saw periods of active inflows into Binance, as early buyers attempted to take profits. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, XRP whale holdings dropped to a three-year low, as traders used the recent rally to shift their portfolios. XRP retains a diverse trading profile, recently expanding the role of USDC in trading. The token also has active markets against the Korean won, as well as Binance’s FDUSD stablecoin.

While Bitcoin remains the backbone of BlackRock’s crypto portfolio, Ethereum has emerged as the fastest-growing component. The massive influx of ETH purchases in Q3 reshaped the firm’s allocation, with its Ethereum position more than tripling in value over the three-month period. H1 vs. Q3 growth trajectory The latest quarterly performance builds on an already strong first half of the year. In H1 2025, BlackRock’s portfolio grew by $23.91 billion, rising from $54.77 billion on January 1 to $78.67 billion on June 30.

Data tracked by Arkham shows that between October 1 and October 8, BlackRock’s portfolio grew by an additional $10.43 billion, averaging more than $1 billion in new value per day. As of October 8, its Bitcoin stash stood at 769,220 BTC ($95.96 billion), while its Ethereum holdings reached 3.89 million ETH ($18.26 billion). BlackRock’s outsized inflows continue to dwarf competitors. On October 6 alone, its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) accounted for 85% of all BTC ETF inflows, adding 6,447 BTC worth over $805 million. Its iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) captured 88% of ETH ETF inflows that same day, absorbing 45,672 ETH valued at $212.9 million.

Bitcoin recently reached new all-time highs of over in both U.S. dollar and Japanese yen terms, boosted by new Japanese prime minister, Takaichi Sanae 's bias for ultra-easy Abenomics policy setting. However, the very same Abenomics bias now seems to be working against BTC through its impact on the bond market. One of the key features of Abenomics is the implementation of an expansionary fiscal policy, characterised by increased government spending to support economic growth. In other words, bond supply could increase, worsening the already dour fiscal outlook. The Japanese government bonds seem to be pricing that, pushing yields higher. (bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction). According to TradingEconomics, the 10-year JGB yield hit a high of 1.70% early Wednesday, the highest since July 2008. It has risen by 13.31 basis points in one week and over 76 basis points in 12 months. The 30-year yield rose to 3.34% and quickly fell back to 3.16%. Rising bond yields typically zap investor risk appetite as they increase the cost of borrowing, denting the appeal of riskier assets such as stocks and cryptocurrencies. Some analysts view bitcoin as both a risk asset and a digital form of gold, although historically data shows that the cryptocurrency tends to track tech stocks more closely. The upswing in JGB yield is even more concerning, considering its impact on the global bonds. According to Goldman Sachs, volatility in Japanese bonds could spill over into Treasury notes, adding to market jitters. For every 10 basis point ""idiosyncratic JGB (Japanese government bond) shock,” investors can expect around two to three basis points of upward pressure on U.S., German and U.K. yields, strategists at Goldman Sachs said in a recent market note, according to Bloomberg. Dollar strength The dollar index has climbed to a two-month high and the move is likely being led by the depreciation in the Japanese yen, which has dropped 3.5% against the USD since Friday. The JPY's decline is also linked to Abenomics, which calls for low interest rates at home. The probability of a Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike this month has dropped since Sanae talked about Abenomics on Saturday. The dollar index comprises six major fiat currencies – EUR, JPY, GBP, CAD, SEK and CHF. The euro has the highest weight followed by the yen. A rising DXY often causes financial tightening and caps upside in BTC, gold and other dollar-denominated assets. While BTC's rally has stalled, gold remains entirely unaffected, pushing through $4,000 an ounce as investors continue to seek safe-haven exposure.",Markets|yen|Japan|Bitcoin|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|ASIA,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-08 09:22:18

Once seen as a niche experiment, Bitcoin and its digital cousins are now powering a growing share of the online casino industry. What began with a handful of daring platforms offering BTC deposits has matured into an ecosystem of crypto-first casinos, many of which now rival traditional operators in size, speed, and user experience. The potential benefits for regulated casinos, which have long relied on fiat, are significant. The obvious question follows: Will they finally move toward Bitcoin adoption, opening up new opportunities and efficiencies? Players’ frustrations with conventional systems are driving this shift. Bank transfers and card payments are often slow, costly, and subject to strict checks. By contrast, crypto transactions can be near-instant, cheaper, and, depending on the platform, far more private. Anonymity has become one of the biggest draws, especially as regulatory pressures on fiat platforms increase. However, it's important to note that the anonymity of crypto transactions can also be a double-edged sword, as it can facilitate money laundering and other illicit activities. Gamblers value the option to play without surrendering a mountain of personal documents, and blockchain technology gives them a transparent ledger that reduces fraud while ensuring fairness. For operators, the business case is strong. Crypto casinos don’t just move funds faster; they save on processing fees and reach a global audience without the restrictions that plague fiat transactions. In 2022, almost half of online casino bets were placed using crypto, a staggering signal that digital assets are no longer on the fringes. If this trend continues, every competitive online casino will have to seriously consider whether sticking to fiat-only payments risks losing market share. The technical barriers are also lower than ever. Payment gateways such as CoinGate and BitPay make it simple for casinos to accept Bitcoin and Ethereum alongside more niche coins. These services handle conversions, mass payouts, and refunds, effectively removing the operational headaches that might have scared off regulated operators in the past. From the player’s side, deposits and withdrawals are seamless. Select a coin, send it to a unique wallet address, and the funds arrive in minutes. Of course, the legal landscape is more complex. Regulation varies widely depending on the jurisdiction. The UK Gambling Commission , for example, does not forbid crypto gambling but requires licensed operators to meet strict anti-money laundering obligations. In Europe, countries like Malta and Estonia actively support crypto casinos, while others remain hesitant. The lack of a unified approach has made regulated sites cautious, even as offshore crypto platforms thrive. Still, the pressure is mounting. Players increasingly expect the same payment options they use elsewhere, whether it’s shopping online or sending funds across borders, to be available in casinos. The surge in crypto-native platforms has also raised expectations around bonuses and promotions. Many of these casinos offer generous free spins, no-deposit deals, and flexible payment terms that put fiat competitors on the back foot. This growing player expectation is creating an urgent need for change in the industry, a need that cannot be ignored. The real tipping point may come when regulated casinos recognise that crypto adoption is not only a competitive necessity but also a trust-building tool. Blockchain’s immutability and transparency could be used to reinforce fair play, providing players with a sense of security. If regulators and operators can strike a balance between compliance and innovation, Bitcoin could move from a niche option to a standard feature in the mainstream iGaming world. Regulators will play a crucial role in this process, as they will need to update their frameworks to accommodate crypto gambling while ensuring that it remains fair and safe for players. For now, crypto-first casinos are leading the charge, but the trajectory is clear. As the appetite for fast, borderless, and transparent gaming grows, the pressure on regulated sites to adopt BTC will only intensify. What once seemed like a gamble for operators may soon look like the safest bet of all. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Unnamed sources familiar with the development have told Bloomberg that Fight Fight Fight LLC, which issues the TRUMP meme coin and is led by Trump ally and longtime promoter Bill Zanker, wants to establish a dedicated entity that will accumulate and manage Trump-linked digital assets, including the TRUMP token itself. Although the exact figures are still being discussed, the sources said the firm could ultimately target as much as $1 billion if investor demand proves strong enough. They cautioned, however, that the plan remains under development and could change depending on market conditions and regulatory considerations. For Zanker, the move represents another step in his ongoing effort to revive enthusiasm around the token, which remains down roughly 90% from its all-time high. Earlier this year, he organised a private dinner between Donald Trump and top holders of the TRUMP coin, part of a campaign by Fight Fight Fight to ignite community enthusiasm and encourage participation. The company had also planned to launch a Trump-branded crypto wallet for trading and storage, but that project was abandoned after a dispute with World Liberty Financial, another Trump-linked venture. The Trump family’s involvement in digital assets has expanded rapidly over the past year, stretching across Bitcoin mining, stablecoins, and even crypto exchange-traded funds. Supporters view these ventures as part of Trump’s promise to usher in what he called a “golden age for crypto,” while critics have questioned whether the ventures serve broader adoption goals or merely self-enrichment. Despite these ambitious plans, the TRUMP meme coin itself has struggled to retain the momentum and demand it saw at launch. After soaring to nearly $44 in January, the token now trades around $8. TRUMP’s downfall has been compounded by market uncertainty around the project and an influx of new meme tokens competing for attention. Zanker, for his part, continues to frame the token’s volatility as temporary and has suggested that the upcoming treasury could provide the stability needed to restore confidence. More crypto treasury companies enter the market According to data from PitchBook, over 80 companies accumulating various cryptocurrencies have launched this year. This month alone, several new entrants have announced their own digital asset treasury programs, with many of these companies often going down this route as a means to enhance shareholder value. On Oct. 7, Toronto-based fintech firm Pineapple unveiled a $100 million Injective treasury, kicking off with a market purchase of more than 678,000 INJ tokens. The company plans to stake its holdings to generate yield and integrate Injective’s blockchain into its core mortgage-finance business. That same day, CleanCore Solutions disclosed that it holds over 710 million Dogecoin, including $20 million in unrealised gains, as part of its ongoing effort to build a one-billion-DOGE treasury backed by strategic partnerships with Bitstamp and the House of Doge. Earlier in the month, Japan’s Mobcast Holdings announced plans to create a Solana treasury by raising roughly $10 million through equity and bond issuance.

The initial trickle of platforms accepting Bitcoin has evolved into a robust stream of crypto-centric casinos, challenging conventional online gambling sites to innovate or fall behind. What Drives Casinos to Adopt Cryptocurrency? The appeal of cryptocurrency in the gambling world is multifaceted. Crypto transactions offer distinct advantages over traditional banking methods, including speed, cost efficiency, and enhanced privacy. These benefits are not just theoretical but are influencing player preferences and expectations. Operators are noticing these shifts. The allure of reduced processing fees and the ability to circumvent geographical restrictions presents a compelling business case. As of 2022, a significant volume of bets at online casinos utilized cryptocurrency, indicating a pivot point in payment preferences among users. Technological and Operational Advantages Integrating cryptocurrency is simpler than ever for casinos due to advanced payment gateways like CoinGate and BitPay, which alleviate common operational challenges associated with crypto payments, like currency conversion and handling refunds. Regulatory Challenges and Opportunities Despite the advantages, the regulatory environment remains a hurdle. The stance on cryptocurrency gambling varies widely across jurisdictions. For instance, while The UK Gambling Commission does not prohibit it, stringent anti-money laundering measures are mandatory. In regions like Malta and Estonia, crypto casinos receive considerable support, contrasting with more cautious approaches elsewhere. This fragmented regulatory landscape makes it tricky for established casinos to fully embrace cryptocurrencies, though the trend is gradually gaining acceptance. Market Dynamics and Player Expectations The rise of crypto-native platforms has recalibrated player expectations, particularly regarding payment flexibility and bonus structures. Traditional casinos face growing pressure to match these offerings to retain their customer base. Incorporating cryptocurrency might not just be a strategic move but a necessary evolution to maintain competitiveness and relevance in a rapidly changing market. The Path Forward for Traditional Casinos Embracing cryptocurrency could also serve as a trust-building measure. The transparency and immutability of blockchain technology can enhance fairness and security in gambling operations, aligning with player demands for trustworthy platforms. The integration of digital currencies like Bitcoin is becoming a strategic imperative for regulated casinos. As both technology and player preferences evolve, the shift towards crypto could transition from being a competitive advantage to a standard industry practice. Conclusion The trajectory for cryptocurrency in online gaming is on an upward curve. While challenges remain, particularly in regulatory compliance and market adaptation, the potential benefits are too significant to ignore. The question is no longer about if traditional casinos will adopt Bitcoin, but when and how they will make this transition to meet the new norms of digital gambling.

Bitcoin (BTC) briefly tumbled under $121,000, whereas Ethereum (ETH) and other popular altcoins registered even more substantial losses. BTC Heads South The start of the business week offered additional gains to the primary cryptocurrency, whose price tapped a new all-time high of over $126,000 on October 6. The bulls, however, could not maintain the momentum, and the valuation has been on a downtrend since then. A few hours ago, BTC tumbled to as low as $120,700 before rebounding to the current $121,700 (per CoinGecko’s data), representing a 2% decline on a daily scale. BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko We have yet to see whether that is a healthy pullback or the beginning of a bearish trend. The massive inflows into spot BTC ETFs and the shrinking amount of coins stored on crypto exchanges suggest the first scenario is more likely. Following the latest correction, Bitcoin’s market capitalization plunged to approximately $2.42 trillion. Its dominance over the altcoins remains relatively unchanged at around 56.9%. ETH Loses an Important Resistance Level The majority of the leading altcoins have followed BTC’s trajectory. Ethereum (ETH) dipped by 5% over the past day and plunged below $4,500. Ripple’s XRP retraced by 4% to $2.86, whereas Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are down by 2-3%. Plasma (XPL) is the biggest loser from the top 100 club with a daily drop of 11%. World Liberty Financial (WLFI) and Pi Network (PI) come next with dips of 9% and 8%, respectively. However, some alts remain in green territory. Binance Coin (BNB) is up 6% for the day and trades well above $1,300. As CryptoPotato reported , it has become the third-biggest cryptocurrency after flipping Ripple’s XRP and USDT (the stablecoin issued by Tether). PancakeSwap (CAKE), Mantle (MNT), and Aster (ASTER) have also posted significant gains. The total market capitalization of the sector has tumbled by 2% over the last 24 hours and stands at roughly $4.27 trillion.

The investment company, which was rebranded from the venture arm of crypto exchange Binance last year, is targeting BNB-based projects in areas such as trading, real-world assets (RWAs), artificial intelligence (AI), decentralized finance (DeFi) and wallets, according to an announcement on X on Wednesday. YZI Labs said it wants the BNB ecosystem to form a backbone of ""democratized access and ownership, AI to enhance human potential and biotech to improve quality of life."" ""Through this $1B BNB Builder Fund, YZi Labs is committed to supporting BNB builders across sectors such as DeFi, AI, RWA, DeSci, and more — those building the next generation of open systems that connect technology back to human progress,"" said Ella Zhang, Head of YZi Labs. Following Binance founder Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao's release from prison last year , he took a more active role in the company's venture capital arm , rebranded YZi Labs, to target startups in Web3, AI and biotech. YZI Labs is in fact often referred to as Zhao's family office - the name for an investment vehicle that manages the wealth of a single family.

But despite Solana’s momentum, Mutuum Finance is stealing the show. Still in its Phase 6 presale and already over 60% sold out, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is getting unprecedented momentum for its dual-lending infrastructure. The project has raised over $16.9 million and over 16800 investors are now onboard. Both of these projects could together front-run October’s breakout rally, but only one appears set to deliver the kind of exponential upside that converts early conviction into legendary returns. Solana Price Outlook, Bullish Momentum Poined for the Next Breakout After a spectacular rally that had Solana (SOL) go as high as $238 before a slight pullback to the regions of $228, the recent pullback can be interpreted as nothing more than a healthy correction within a broader trend that remains bullish. According to analysts, as long as SOL is above its key support levels, the momentum is very much alive, with upside targets now being spotted at $242, $254, and $262 in the near term. This brief consolidation phase can be the launchpad for the subsequent big move, one which may take SOL to its previous cycle highs. And while Solana’s technicals present room to ascend further, investors tracking market-defining opportunity may find that the largest gains have a way of manifesting where innovation outpaces price action, focus being placed on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Finance Presale Rise Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to attract interest as its presale Phase 6 is picking up a lot of steam. Interest from investors remains high, with over 16,800 investors investing over $16.9 million, an indicator that confidence in the project’s long-term potential and future in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem continues to build. Mutuum Finance protocol is based on dynamic Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and live liquidation factors that change in real time based on market conditions. This dynamic functionality allows active hedging of volatility, thereby increasing the robustness of the protocol against volatile market conditions. Next-Generation Lending and Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has reaffirmed it will launch its innovative lending and borrowing protocol , a new exciting addition to its expanding DeFi ecosystem. The protocol’s version 1 (V1) will be live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, the first to launch with it a full suite of core features such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, and more. Starting from day one, the protocol will be supported by ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateralization, giving users a high-speed, efficient, and scalable DeFi experience. Reserve multipliers are also employed to give the system an additional layer of security, ranging from 10% to low-risk assets and 35% to risk assets, as a second layer of protection from the markets. Collateral management in MUTM is designed to maximize borrowing power and aggregate capital efficiency by synergetic utilization of the correlated assets. Collectively, these mechanisms minimize insolvency risk while delivering a secure, stable, and sustainable DeFi lending environment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Leading DeFi Innovation in 2025 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast emerging as one of the most promising opportunities in decentralized finance, having raised over $16.9 million from more than 16,800 investors in its Phase 6 presale, during which the tokens were available at $0.035. Its lending and borrowing protocol, launching on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, features liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot, all designed to optimize capital efficiency and risk management through adaptive Loan-to-Value ratios and dynamic liquidation factors. Security measures, including reserve multipliers and a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program, also help to instill investor confidence. While Solana (SOL) has upside momentum to $262, MUTM inherently has more upside leverage for long-term, asymmetric gains. Secure your position today to be a part of a project that will revolutionize DeFi in 2025.

MAGACOIN FINANCE has now raised in excess of $15.5 million, attracting both seasoned and first-time buyers. Together with its fast growing ecosystem, these features position MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most structured and transparent presales in the market this year. Bitcoin (BTC): ETF Inflows Drive Institutional Confidence Recent developments in Bitcoin ETFs (as of October 2025) reveal a significant increase in institutional inflows. Reports show that inflows of Bitcoin ETFs totalled about $4.5 billion last week as demand increased. Investors are confident. US spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed inflows worth around $3.2 billion last week, the second highest ever. The global crypto ETFs attracted $5.95 billion, with the majority invested in Bitcoin, according to a report. Overall sentiment remains bullish among market participants. Bitcoin ETFs saw huge inflows. A total of approximately $20 billion is forecasted for 2025, highlighting that institutional interest is increasingly adopting the top cryptocurrency as a core asset. XRP: Buyers Test Resistance Amid ETF Momentum XRP is witnessing a tough battle between the buyers and sellers at the downtrend line. The 20-day EMA ($2.94) has started to turn up gradually, and the RSI is just above the midpoint, indicating a slight edge to the bulls. The descending triangle pattern will be invalidated on a close above the downtrend line. That may result in a short squeeze, pushing the XRP price to $3.40 and later to $3.66. Conversely, if the price turns down sharply and breaks below the moving averages, it suggests that the XRP/USDT pair may spend some more time inside the triangle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Presale Momentum and Investor Advantage MAGACOIN FINANCE has become one of the hottest presales for Q4 2025. The presale is designed to reward early investors with a PATRIOT50X bonus that increases token allocations to participants. Analysts and investors have already heaped huge praise on MAGACOIN FINANCE calling it one of the top crypto presales for 2025 . The audit-backed transparency and roadmap make it appealing to both new and seasoned investors seeking a structured and credible early-stage crypto project. There is increasing investor confidence in Bitcoin and XRP among individuals who already own the coins. Conclusion ETF inflows and technical momentum reinforce investor focus on Bitcoin and XRP. Meanwhile, MAGACOIN FINANCE is positioning itself as a high-potential presale, offering PATRIOT50X bonuses and audit-backed security. With verified smart contracts publicly available on Hashex.org , MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to earn a reputation as a safe and legitimate presale trusted by analysts. This combination of features makes it an attractive early-stage crypto investment to watch in Q4 2025.

With institutional accumulation on the rise and upgrades to improve scalability, analysts are revising their Ethereum price prediction higher. As the ETH price today consolidates near key resistance, traders are asking one question — when will Ethereum price finally hit the long-awaited $5,000 milestone? Ethereum Price Prediction Strengthens With Major Accumulation Ethereum is back in the spotlight as new ETH news reveals that Tom Lee’s blockchain investment firm, BitMine, has increased its Ethereum holdings to an impressive $13 billion. The move is being seen as a massive show of confidence in Ethereum’s long-term strength and could fuel bullish momentum in the months ahead. Analysts believe this wave of institutional buying could push the ETH price closer to $5,000 before year-end. According to market experts, BitMine’s accumulation signals a shift in sentiment among big investors who now see Ethereum as the dominant player in decentralized finance. The upcoming Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4844) upgrade is also expected to boost scalability and lower gas fees. This is further strengthening the Ethereum price prediction outlook. Meanwhile, the ETH price today remains steady near $4,500. This follows a spike in trading volumes across major exchanges. With Ethereum news spreading across the market, traders are positioning for a potential breakout once resistance levels clear. If institutional demand continues at this pace, hitting $5,000 may not be a question of “if,” but “when.” Remittix Positions Itself Beside Ethereum In Utility And Adoption Remittix continues to gain traction as one of the most talked-about DeFi projects in 2025, with its strong fundamentals drawing comparisons to Ethereum’s early growth phase. Trading at $0.1130, the project has raised over $27.2 million and sold more than 676 million tokens, signaling strong investor confidence. While Ethereum price predictions are eyeing the $5,000 mark, many analysts see Remittix (RTX) as the next logical step in the evolution of blockchain payments.

Public reporting by Bloomberg and statements by YZi leadership indicate operational distinction between venture operations and any family office activity. YZi has denied functioning solely as a family office in recent statements (plain text). Public on‑chain analysis by Bubblemaps (plain text) shows broad profitability among BNB traders, while on‑chain dashboards referenced by industry sources indicate that a substantial portion of the circulating BNB supply is concentrated among large holders.

Little Pepe is currently trading below $0.0025, and its innovative features and successful presale movement are driving expectations for Little Pepe to skyrocket by an extraordinary 14,443% in the near future. Introducing Little Pepe Little Pepe is not simply another meme token but a utility-backed meme coin based on an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 blockchain. This guarantees higher transaction rates and significantly reduces costs compared to the Ethereum mainnet, which increases usability. The maximum number of tokens is limited to 100 billion, and 26.5% of these will be allocated during the presale. In contrast to most meme coins, Little Pepe features high-utility components, including no trading tax, sniper bot protection, staking rewards, and a dedicated meme launchpad. Presale Information The LILPEPE presale is on stage 13 and is being sold at $0.0022 per token. To date, this phase alone has sold more than 16.18 billion tokens and has raised in excess of $26.42 million. The next stage price of the presale will be higher by $0.0023, indicating that there is a strong demand because investors want to be early before prices go higher. The following are the stages of presale: Stage 1: $0.001 - Raised $500k Stage 2: $0.0011 - Raised $1.325M Stage 3: $0.0012 - Raised $2.5M The next phases slowly added prices and capital increased. Stage 13 (active): $0.022 per unit—16.18 billion tokens sold, raising more than $26.42M. Stage 14 (upcoming): $0.0023 price In total, the sum of the presale token allocation is more than 26.5 billion, representing over 26% of the total 100 billion supply of the token, which indicates high investor interest. How Little Pepe Will Out-Compete Shiba Inu. Shiba Inu is currently priced at approximately $0.00001170 . Although the project has already made headlines due to its enormous returns in the past, Little Pepe, with its utility-based nature and strategic pre-sale milestones, is poised to generate an unprecedented profit. The price movement of Shiba Inu (SHIB) over the next few months is projected to be somewhat flat to slightly downward, and the token is likely to be valued at $0.0000117 in September 2025. Historical patterns suggest that SHIB has not been able to achieve steady returns over this period. The current low trade volume, approximately 150 million per day, indicates a low level of market interest. Little Pepe has a current price of $0.0022 (Stage 13), which is lower than its target of $0.0025. A rise from $0.0022 to $0.35 indicates an increase of almost 15,800% (nearly the 14,443% forecast). Conversely, Shiba Inu would need to rise to approximately $0.0014 to achieve that percentage, and it is unlikely to happen in the near future, considering its market cap and saturation. That is pure ROI math: at $100 at $0.0022 to get to $0.35, the returns are approximately $15,909, which explains why investors are flooding to gain early ground. Key Features Driving Growth Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 Blockchain: This enables low-cost, high-speed transactions and is ideally suited for expanding communities and DeFi applications. Zero Trading Tax: The active traders are encouraged by the elimination of the transaction penalty. Sniper Bot Protection: Guarantees the token against unjust fast-buy attacks that could put new projects at risk. Staking Rewards: The tokens generate passive income, motivating owners to hold onto them. Meme Launchpad: The sponsor of meme projects, which is expanding the ecosystem value. DAO Voting: Enhances participation and transparency and gives the community the right to govern. Future NFTs and Cross-Chain Compatibility: The possibilities of the future that will allow more functionality of tokens and market access. Little Pepe has also started a giveaway worth $777,000 to celebrate continuous presale success. Ten winners will have the opportunity to win $77,000 in Little Pepe tokens. Moreover, a Mega Giveaway will be used to reward large and random buyers at Stages 12-17 with prizes exceeding 15 ETH, serving as an added incentive to participate. Conclusion Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is a next-generation meme coin that offers exceptional returns, potentially increasing by 14,443.72% from a starting price of less than $0.0025. Its Ethereum Layer 2 foundation, its brisk performance in presale, and its zero-tax trading, staking, and future utility options have it highly competing to outperform Shiba Inu in the next few months. As more investors are jumping to claim their tokens at the existing presale rates due to the massive giveaways, Little Pepe's growth momentum is clear, supported by measurable data.

What Sets Little Pepe Apart? Unlike ordinary meme coins, Little Pepe operates on an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2 blockchain, offering faster transaction speeds and lower costs. The coin's ecosystem is designed to support a variety of utility features such as sniper bot protection, zero trading tax, and attractive staking rewards. These aspects are essential for fostering a sustainable token economy and enhancing investor confidence.

Currently, in Stage 13, the coin is priced at $0.0022, indicating a steady interest as the presale progresses. More than 16.18 billion tokens have been sold, accumulating over $26.42 million in funding. The upcoming Stage 14 is set with an increased price of $0.0023, reflecting continuing demand.

Historically, when Bitcoin (BTC) gains momentum, DeFi tokens often outperform it, driven by yield generation and protocol expansion. Among these, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a promising undervalued asset. Its focus on lending, staking, and buybacks positions it as a higher-growth play for the next bull market. For those watching crypto investing trends closely, MUTM appears to be the value buy of this stage. Mutuum Finance (MUTM): lending utility scales with BTC rally The project is now in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035, with roughly $16.9 million raised and about 60% of the current allocation sold. The next phase will raise the price by 15% to $0.04, adding urgency for early buyers. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has a total supply of 4 billion tokens and over 16,800 holders. Its security foundation is backed by a CertiK audit, with a TokenScan score of 90.00 and a Skynet score of 79.00. With over 12,000 Twitter followers, community engagement is building rapidly as the presale advances. Mutuum Finance revealed that it is building a new platform for crypto lending and borrowing. The first version, known as V1, will be launched on the Sepolia Testnet in late 2025. It will include important features like a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to manage the process smoothly. In the beginning, users can lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral through a simple and safe system. As the crypto fear and greed index shifts toward greed, capital inflows are expected to rise across the ecosystem. Bitcoin (BTC)’s rally will likely pull liquidity into decentralized finance, where users will seek additional yield on their holdings. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will stand ready to capture this momentum through its dual lending structure — Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). In P2C, lenders will deposit stablecoins such as USDC, or DAI to earn interest. Borrowers will post assets like ETH or BTC as collateral to access liquidity. Each deposit will mint mtTokens, representing both pool ownership and accrued yield. In P2P, users will negotiate directly for less liquid tokens, enabling higher returns on assets that don’t fit the standard risk model. Both systems will generate constant transaction activity, driving utility-based demand for the MUTM token. As Bitcoin (BTC) appreciation attracts new liquidity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s lending volume will expand, reinforcing its role as a DeFi yield hub. Investors entering during the presale will be exposed to both lending growth and token appreciation as market participation increases. Buy-and-distribute links activity to price Unlike many DeFi tokens that rely solely on speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will connect platform activity directly to token demand. Its buy-and-distribute model will allocate platform revenue to purchase MUTM from the open market and distribute it to mtToken stakers. This continuous cycle of buybacks and distributions will create a built-in demand engine that supports price stability and long-term growth. The amount of buybacks will also go up when more loans are made and paid back. Every time you buy something back, it will take away demand before giving it back to long-term customers. This will make the token’s market floor stronger and make sure that staking stays profitable. In prior DeFi cycles, similar techniques raised tokens by 5x to 10x, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s combination of staking and buybacks is meant to create stronger compounding effects. Analysts think that during the next bullish phase, this cycle will boost MUTM up to around $2, especially as more people start using it. Beta launch and exchange listings open floodgates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also benefit from its upcoming beta launch, which will allow users to experience its full ecosystem before public trading begins. The beta will showcase its lending and staking systems in real-time, letting users earn mtTokens and witness yield generation firsthand. This stage will help demonstrate transparency, usability, and scalability — three factors that build investor trust ahead of expected exchange listings. Following the beta period, listings on leading platforms such as KuCoin and MEXC will open the project to global liquidity. The integration with Layer-2 scaling will cut gas fees and improve transaction speeds, further encouraging adoption. As user activity increases, staking and buybacks will reinforce the token’s economic loop, setting the stage for a major price re-rating once trading begins. The growing optimism in crypto investing, alongside a strong crypto fear and greed index reading, suggests a favourable backdrop for assets with real yield and scalability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has three main ways to grow: a live lending ecosystem, a repurchase engine that works on its own, and Layer-2 scalability. These attributes are just what a market needs to get ready for a BTC-led bull run. Experts think BTC will hit $150,000 in the first quarter of 2026, and analysts say that MUTM will make those profits even bigger, by 20X or more. The presale’s sixth phase is almost over, and the price is $0.035. Now is the time to join if you want to get in on the next wave of DeFi growth before the price goes up to $0.04.

At this point, while the SEC continues its work with limited staff, the approval and launch of altcoin ETFs, which were due in October, were also delayed. While many altcoins like XRP, Solana (SOL) and Litecoin (LTC) are awaiting ETF approval, a new ETF application has arrived in the US. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart reported that GraniteShares has filed for a series of 3x leveraged cryptocurrency ETFs. These applications include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana, and XRP. The company is requesting approval for leveraged ETFs that offer 3x long and 3x short positions on the respective tokens' price. The recommended funds offer a significantly higher risk-reward profile compared to 2x leveraged alternatives currently available from ProShares and Teucrium. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart said the filings suggest regulators “may be open to allowing more volatile products into the market.” As is well known, the SEC fundamentally simplified the crypto ETF approval process by approving the General Listing Standards for commodity-based exchange-traded products on September 17, 2025. Accordingly, exchanges like Nasdaq, NYSE Arca, and Cboe BZX will now be able to list eligible products without requiring individual Section 19(b) reviews, eliminating months of regulatory delays. *This is not investment advice.

New Crypto Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Shows Strength as XRP Price Prediction Points to Slowing Growth,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/can-xrp-reach-10-new-crypto-little-pepe-lilpepe-shows-strength-as-xrp-price-prediction-points-to-slowing-growth,"The cryptocurrency world is full of ups and downs, and right now, the U.S. government shutdown, combined with delays in regulations, is adding to the worry. As a result, XRP, a major player in the cryptocurrency world, is losing momentum, but a new meme coin called Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is capturing attention with its rapid rise. XRP still has good chances in the long run, but in the short term, it’s slowing, especially since it can’t push past $2. XRP Deals with Rule Problems and Weak Market People have extensively discussed XRP reaching $10. But with the latest rule troubles and the government shutdown, it’s hard to see that happening soon. In October 2025, XRP is trading just under $2.8, facing significant roadblocks due to unclear rules. The SEC has most of its staff off due to the shutdown, so key decisions, such as approving crypto ETFs, are on hold. Events like this have previously hurt XRP prices. During the 2018 shutdown, it dropped by about 12.8%. With the same mess now, experts believe XRP could fall further, particularly given its ongoing court battle with the SEC. Hopes for a spot XRP ETF got pushed back, which was supposed to boost the price. This has dampened people's enthusiasm, and XRP may dip below $2, possibly even to $1.50 if the situation remains unfavorable. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) - The Meme Coin Picking Up Speed While XRP is struggling with regulatory issues and a slow market, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is gaining momentum rapidly. This meme coin has raised $26.3 million in its presale, selling over 16.1 billion tokens in just 13 stages. As the presale price continues to rise, it is a solid choice for fans of meme coins and other cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Unlike many meme coins that boom and bust on hype alone, Little Pepe has a smart setup for lasting growth. It sets aside 30% of tokens for backup and 13.5% for rewards when traders stake them, so it’s building for the future while growing now. Additionally, its fan base is growing rapidly. It has over 43,000 holders already, and a thriving community on Telegram with more than 36,000 members actively engaging in discussions. Their $777,000 prize giveaway has attracted over 400,000 people, demonstrating how it spreads like wildfire and draws in more than just typical meme fans. Experts are saying Little Pepe could jump 7200% in value, even before it hits big trading sites. If it continues like this, it might become the next Dogecoin or Shiba Inu, yielding huge returns for early buyers. Can XRP Hit $10? XRP is a solid cryptocurrency pick, but with the current regulatory mess and market sentiment, $10 seems far off right now. It keeps hitting rule walls and shaky times, and the shutdown exacerbates the issue. Experts say it could drop more if the ETF stays delayed. That said, XRP could rebound in the long term. If rules clear up and big money jumps in, it might surge. However, for now, without significant changes in regulations or a hot market, $10 is unlikely to occur. Little Pepe is the Meme Coin to Keep an Eye On Meanwhile, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is building hype with its strong presale and fan-driven push. While rule worries hold back XRP, Little Pepe is riding a meme coin wave. Its price is already climbing, and some experts see significant gains in 2025. As more people jump in, it’s set to take on Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, making it a top meme coin to watch soon. Conclusion: XRP Has Tough Times While Little Pepe Shines As XRP fights to maintain its upward momentum amid regulatory delays, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) continues to soar, driven by its growing fan base and strategic positioning. XRP’s road to $10 is fuzzy in the short term, but Little Pepe offers fun chances for meme coin fans chasing the next hit. With its big early sales, growing crowd, and shot at huge returns, Little Pepe might beat out XRP in 2025, turning into one of the best meme coin bets around.

Recently, the U.S. government shutdown has exacerbated these challenges, impacting major currencies like XRP and paving the way for emerging coins like Little Pepe (LILPEPE). The Struggles and Hopes of XRP Traditionally, XRP has been a significant player in the crypto space, but it's currently facing hurdles that hinder its growth potential. The ongoing government shutdown has slowed down necessary regulatory processes, affecting all corners of the crypto market. Notably, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is caught in these delays, impacting decisions critical to the crypto market, like the approval of new Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). With the SEC's slowed operations, XRP faces more pronounced stagnation, struggling to cross even the $2 mark, far from the speculated $10 target. Emergence of Little Pepe (LILPEPE) as a Meme Coin Contender In contrast to XRP's predicaments, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) is a new entrant making significant strides in the market. This meme coin has successfully garnered a large following and substantial funding, evidenced by its impressive presale figures. The appeal of Little Pepe is not just in its branding but also in its strategic foresight—reserving a substantial percentage of tokens for future stability and user rewards. Little Pepe's community engagement is robust, with a lively presence on platforms like Telegram, where over 36,000 members actively discuss the coin's prospects and developments. Future Predictions: Will XRP Climb or Decline? While XRP is a strong cryptocurrency with potential for recovery, its journey to $10 is currently fraught with too many regulatory barriers and market uncertainties. The lack of positive market stimuli and the ongoing SEC issues continue to cast doubts on its short-term growth. Prospects of Little Pepe in the Meme Coin Market Little Pepe, on the other hand, is navigating the meme coin market with notable success. Predictions suggest it might see an astronomical rise in value, much like predecessors Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The enthusiasm around Little Pepe, coupled with strategic planning, positions it as a potentially lucrative investment for meme coin enthusiasts and investors looking for the next big crypto sensation. Conclusion: Divergent Paths in the Crypto Market As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, XRP and Little Pepe (LILPEPE) exemplify how diverse factors influence different segments of the market.

The account is being used to promote a fake meme coin called Mr Pancake. The exchange platform acknowledged the compromise and confirmed it’s actively working with the X team to resolve the matter. PancakeSwap team has also urged its users to ignore suspicious posts from the compromised account and avoid any engagement. CAKE jumps over 12% today despite the news of the breach Following the announcement of the breach, the CAKE token has jumped to over 12% despite the negative news from the exchange platform. The token was volatile, trading at $4.34, representing a 10.77% increase over the past 24 hours at the time of publication. The token also recorded an intraday high of $4.52 before stabilizing around $4.34. The token’s current market capitalisation is $1.49 billion, with an average 24-hour trading volume of $1.17 billion, representing a 79.8% increase. Update: We’re actively working with the X team to resolve the issue with @PancakeSwapzh . Please do not click on any links or interact with posts from that account until we confirm recovery. Stay vigilant and only trust updates from this official account, @PancakeSwap . — PancakeSwap (@PancakeSwap) October 8, 2025 The latest breach on the Chinese PancakeSwap X account follows a recent compromise of BNB Chain’s official X account, which was used to promote and distribute a fake rewards link. Changpeng Zhao urged users to avoid clicking on links posted on the compromised account last week, stating that the teams were investigating the matter. The account has since been restored , and investigations are ongoing to find the root cause of the breach. The total loss from the breach was estimated at $8,000, with a single user potentially losing up to $6,500 due to the malicious links posted. Shān Zhang, Chief Information Security Officer at blockchain security firm SlowMist, said the popularity of Binance-affiliated ecosystems makes them prime targets for cybercriminals. He noted that the BNB meme coin market is hot lately, making it more lucrative for scammers to exploit the user base. According to Zhang, weak security awareness among social media administrators is the leading cause of breaches. He noted that many account admins have poor security awareness and are highly susceptible to phishing. Zhang added that education and better credential management could prevent these incidents. AI tools fuel the new wave of cybercrimes The latest attack on PancakeSwap follows a similar trend, including the August attack on Instagram accounts for global artists. Adele, Future, and even FC Barcelona’s Instagram account were subject to attacks promoting unaffiliated Solana-based meme coins. The incidents highlight how quickly viral scams can trick users into purchasing fake tokens or connecting wallets to malicious sites. Slava Demchuk, CEO of blockchain analytics firm AMLBot, revealed that AI-driven fraud has surged sharply over the past year. He noted that attackers are adopting advanced tactics, including using artificial intelligence to automate scams and impersonate legitimate figures. According to research by Kaspersky, AI and social media are being used to reshape scam and phishing tactics, making it hard to detect. The study reveals that Cybercriminals use AI tools and LLMs to generate realistic emails, websites, and social media messages that closely resemble legitimate communication. The report highlights voice cloning, Deepfakes, and AI-generated videos as the most utilized forms of impersonation. It pushes them through media platforms such as Telegram, which uses bots to automate phishing schemes. The Kaspersky study revealed that attackers now target the theft of immutable identity data such as biometrics, signatures, and voice codes over passwords. The study warns that using AI-driven methods has lowered the entry barrier for scammers and urges users to assess all digital media critically, avoid sharing OTPs, and limit personal data online to minimize exposure to evolved scams. Alex Katz, CEO of cybersecurity company Kerberus, noted that the human element remains the weakest link, as it is easy to target. According to Katz, anyone can be compromised, from employees managing social media to blockchain developers.

Institutional staking — led by large managers depositing hundreds of thousands of ETH — is offsetting exits and easing short-term sell-pressure risks. Exit queue size: 2.4M+ ETH (~$10B), ~41 days wait (ValidatorQueue.com) Institutional inflows: Grayscale and funds have added 272,000 ETH (~$1.21B) to staking queues.

Ethereum exit queue surges to 2.4M ETH (~$10B); learn what it means for ETH holders and how institutions are responding — read our analysis. Ethereum’s validator exit queue has surged to a record $10 billion, but institutional participants, such as Grayscale, are stepping in to replace the exodus. Ethereum recorded its largest validator exit on record this week, with more than 2.4 million Ether worth over $10 billion awaiting withdrawal from its proof-of-stake network. Institutional participants are stepping in with significant deposits to the validator entry queue. Ethereum’s exit queue surpassed 2.4 million Ether (ETH) — worth over $10 billion — on Wednesday. The spike in pending withdrawals pushed queue time to more than 41 days and 21 hours , according to blockchain data from ValidatorQueue.com. Validators are responsible for proposing blocks and attesting to transactions on Ethereum’s proof‑of‑stake chain. Their exits and entries directly affect staking supply and short‑term liquid ETH availability. Ether validator queue. Source: ValidatorQueue.com What does a $10 billion Ethereum exit queue mean for ETH holders? The Ethereum exit queue size signals potential near‑term sell pressure because large pending withdrawals increase available liquid ETH if validators choose to sell. However, institutional staking inflows and long‑term holder allocation reduce the immediate risk to network stability and price. How are institutional deposits affecting validator dynamics? Institutions have been active in the staking queue. Grayscale initially staked $150 million in Ether and then deposited an additional 272,000 ETH (~$1.21 billion) into the staking queue. Onchain analyst EmberCN reported Grayscale accounts for a majority of coins currently awaiting staking activation. Those institutional deposits shorten net outflows by adding new stake, while ETFs and corporate treasuries increase demand for non‑circulating ETH. This dynamic helps offset potential sell pressure from validators exiting after large price gains. ETH/USD, one-year chart. Source: Cointelegraph Why is the exit queue larger than the entry queue? The exit queue currently holds roughly five times more ETH than the entry queue. The entry queue shows over 490,000 ETH awaiting staking activation with a wait time of about 8 days 12 hours . Higher exit volumes reflect profit-taking incentives after an ~83% one‑year price rise (Cointelegraph price index). Ethereum entry queue versus exit queue. Source: ValidatorQueue.com How stable is Ethereum despite the exit spike? Short answer: stable. Ethereum still supports over 1 million active validators staking 35.6 million ETH , representing ~ 29.4% of total supply. Those numbers indicate the network’s security and operational stability remain intact despite elevated exit volumes. Source: EmberCN How should traders and long‑term holders interpret this development? Traders should view the exit queue spike as a potential near‑term volatility factor: a portion of the $10 billion could hit markets if validators sell. Long‑term holders should note growing institutional demand: ETFs and corporate treasuries are locking up ETH, which supports medium‑term scarcity. Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset platform Nexo, said: “Institutional and corporate treasuries now hold over 10% of ETH’s total supply, while October ETF inflows have already exceeded $620 million.” He added that this data shows Ethereum’s evolution into a yield‑bearing, institutionally recognized asset used for infrastructure and collateral purposes. How to assess sell‑pressure risk from validator exits (step‑by‑step) Check queue sizes: Compare exit vs entry queue ETH totals (ValidatorQueue.com data). Monitor institutional deposits: Track large staking deposits and ETF inflows as offsetting forces. Estimate activation timelines: Longer wait times delay market impact from exits or entries. Adjust position sizing: Reduce leverage during peak queue volatility to limit downside risk. Follow on‑chain metrics: Active validators, staked supply, and exchange balances provide liquidity context. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How big is the Ethereum validator exit queue?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The exit queue holds over 2.4 million ETH, valued at about $10 billion, with a queue time of roughly 41 days (data from ValidatorQueue.com)."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does the exit queue threaten Ethereum's network security?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""No. Ethereum still has over 1 million active validators staking 35.6 million ETH (29.4% of supply), which maintains network security despite higher exit volumes."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How long will validators wait to withdraw ETH? At current queue sizes, withdrawal wait times are over 41 days. Times change as validators enter or exit and as institutions deposit new stake; monitor ValidatorQueue.com for real‑time updates. Will institutions completely offset exits? Institutions reduce net outflows by adding large stakes, but they may not fully neutralize selling if a high share of exiting validators liquidate. Current data shows significant institutional activity that materially offsets some exit pressure. Key Takeaways Exit queue surge: 2.4M+ ETH (~$10B) increases potential near‑term sell pressure. Institutional offset: Grayscale and funds depositing large ETH amounts into staking queues mitigate outflows. Network remains secure: 1M+ validators and 35.6M ETH staked keep Ethereum operationally resilient. Conclusion The Ethereum validator exit queue reaching over 2.4 million ETH (~$10 billion) raises valid short‑term concerns about sell pressure, but institutional staking and continued validator participation reduce the systemic risk.

Near-certain SEC approval odds Price targets: $290–$345 if spot Solana ETFs are approved Polymarket and Bloomberg analysis indicate approval odds above 99%, with institutional demand likely to increase Spot Solana ETF approval expected this week — anticipate price upside and institutional flows; read actionable analysis and prepare your positions now. Analysts see near-100% odds for SEC approval of spot Solana ETFs, with price targets between $290 and $345 this week as institutional demand and regulatory clarity drive optimism. Analysts predict Solana could rise to $345 if the SEC approves spot ETF applications this week. Bloomberg analysts cite near 100% approval odds, supported by regulatory clarity and leadership changes. Market optimism grows as Polymarket bettors place Solana ETF approval odds above 99%. What is the likelihood of spot Solana ETF approval this week? Spot Solana ETF approval is being priced by analysts and markets as nearly certain this week, with Bloomberg and market bettors indicating approval odds above 99%. The SEC’s adoption of generic listing standards and recent issuer filings underpin the high probability. How would Solana’s price react if spot ETFs are approved? Approval is expected to catalyze institutional inflows and boost liquidity. Analysts have set short-term targets between $290 and $345 for SOL, driven by historical ETF-led capital flows and technical setups. At press time, SOL traded near $221 — roughly a 20% rebound from a recent low of $191. Why are approval odds so high now? Regulatory shifts at the SEC, including generic listing standards for digital-asset ETFs, have accelerated filings. Bloomberg senior ETF analysts point to these adjustments and recent leadership changes as primary drivers. Issuers under review include Fidelity, VanEck, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, and others. Plain-text mentions: Bloomberg, Polymarket, Grayscale, Bitwise, 21Shares, REX Osprey. How should investors prepare for an approval-driven rally? Prepare with a clear plan: reassess risk allocation, set upside targets and stop-losses, and consider phased entries to manage volatility. Historical spot ETF approvals (e.g., earlier Bitcoin spot ETFs) showed rapid inflows followed by consolidation — plan for both volatility and potential sustained demand. Institutional demand and market signals ETF approvals typically attract institutional capital and increase market stability. The REX Osprey Solana Staking ETF recorded over $33 million in first-day trading volume, signaling investor interest in Solana-based products. Market sentiment indicators and betting markets (Polymarket) have priced approval at above 99%, reflecting high conviction among traders. What technical and on-chain indicators support the bullish case? Technical analysts cite an ascending parallel channel and momentum metrics that point to renewed strength. On-chain metrics show increased activity in staking and development activity. Analyst NekoZ and crypto commentator Lark Davis (plain-text mentions) have highlighted chart patterns and deadlines that concentrate market attention this week. Scenario Target (SOL) Driver Approval this week $290–$345 Institutional inflows, ETF listings Delayed decision $200–$250 Continued uncertainty, profit-taking Rejection Below $190 Reduced short-term demand Frequently Asked Questions Will a spot Solana ETF approval immediately double SOL’s price? Not necessarily. Approval typically attracts institutional demand that can push prices higher quickly, but doubling depends on flow size, market liquidity, and macro conditions. Analysts forecast $290–$345, not an immediate 2x move. When will the SEC issue its final ruling? The SEC’s decision window for several filings falls this week; individual filing deadlines vary, with some related reviews citing mid-October final dates. Monitor official SEC communications and issuer notices for confirmed dates. Key Takeaways High approval probability : Market pricing and analyst commentary signal near-certain SEC approval this week. Potential price targets : Analysts cite $290–$345 as realistic short-term targets on approval. Actionable insight : Prepare position sizing, set clear risk controls, and consider phased entries to manage volatility. Conclusion Spot Solana ETF approval appears highly likely and could trigger meaningful institutional inflows and a short-term price re-rating for SOL. Traders should balance upside targets with disciplined risk management. COINOTAG will continue to monitor SEC updates and market flows as the decision window closes.

The model based its projection on current market trends and historical patterns, pointing to the possibility of moderate gains while warning of potential volatility during the holiday period. The forecast assumes no major disruptions such as large-scale regulatory crackdowns or exchange collapses before late November. It also factored in the continuation of the current bullish sentiment in financial markets and Bitcoin’s tendency to experience short-term fluctuations around major holidays. Bitcoin price prediction Under the baseline scenario, Bitcoin could remain relatively stable or rise modestly, trading between $120,000 and $160,000. In a bullish case, driven by institutional inflows or strong demand for Bitcoin exchange-traded funds, the price could climb as high as $200,000. However, if sentiment turns negative or macroeconomic pressures intensify, a correction to the $85,000 and $95,000 range is possible. The analysis noted that Bitcoin’s performance around Thanksgiving has historically been unpredictable, with past years showing both surges and sharp declines. While the holiday season may bring bursts of trading activity, closing prices typically stabilize soon after. Ultimately, the projection highlighted both Bitcoin’s potential for continued strength and its persistent volatility. The AI model’s central estimate places Bitcoin’s likely Thanksgiving 2025 on November 27 value between $140,000 and $160,000. Bitcoin Thanksgiving 2025 price prediction.

The 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) at $114,226 and the 200-day SMA at $105,107 sit well below the spot price, confirming a solid uptrend and suggesting strong medium- to long-term support levels. Meanwhile, the 14-day RSI of 61.06 places Bitcoin in bullish territory without being overbought, leaving room for further upside before conditions become overheated.

Here’s where the next support level could lie, according to on-chain data. Bitcoin Has Witnessed A Fast Plunge During The Last 24 Hours Bitcoin looked to be entering into an extended all-time high (ATH) exploration mode as it set multiple new records over the weekend and Monday, but the market has been delivered a Tuesday shock as the cryptocurrency has seen a quick crash back below $121,000. Compared to the new ATH around $126,200, Bitcoin is now down more than 4%. The altcoins have also taken a hit during the past day, with many top coins even printing returns worse than the number one digital asset. 24-hour losses stand at 5% for Ethereum and 6% for XRP. BNB is the only cryptocurrency among the large caps that has managed a positive return of 5%. Related Reading: Social Media Turns Bearish On XRP: Is This A Buy Signal? With Bitcoin now sliding down, one question naturally arises: how much lower can the asset go? While markets are unpredictable, there can still be some factors worth keeping an eye on. One such factor may be on-chain support clusters. BTC CBD Shows Support Cluster Around $117,000 In a new post on X, on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the Cost Basis Distribution (CBD) is looking for Bitcoin. The CBD is an indictor that tells us about how many tokens of the cryptocurrency were last acquired at the various spot price levels. Below is the chart for the metric shared by Glassnode. As displayed in the above graph, the $120,000 to $121,000 range, which the cryptocurrency is retesting right now, carries the cost basis of a thin amount of supply. In on-chain analysis, investor cost basis is considered an important topic because holders tend to react in a special manner whenever their break-even level is retested. The more supply that was last purchased at a particular level, the stronger is the market’s reaction to a retest. When investors face a retest of their profit-loss boundary from the above, they may decide to buy more, believing the drawdown to be a “dip” or for simply defending their cost basis. Given that the current range contains the cost basis of some investors, some degree of accumulation could happen, but it only remains to be seen whether it will be enough for a bottom.

52839463,601116,1759917627,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/52839463.jpeg,Bank Of England Eyes Exemptions To Controversial Stablecoin Cap Proposal – Details,https://bitcoinist.com/bank-of-england-exemptions-stablecoin-cap-proposal/,"The Bank of England (BOE) is reportedly softening its stance toward digital assets with a potential exemption to a controversial policy that would establish stricter stablecoin rules for the UK market. BOE Plans Stablecoin Cap Exemption On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that the Bank of England is planning to grant exemptions to businesses in the UK from its proposed limit on stablecoin ownership, according to people familiar with the matter. The central bank aims to grant waivers to certain digital asset firms that need to hold large amounts of stablecoins, like crypto exchanges. Additionally, the BOE intends to allow firms to use stablecoins as a settlement asset in its experimental Digital Securities Sandbox. The changes to the sandbox will initially permit firms to adopt regulated stablecoins tied to non-sterling currencies for settlement purposes. This would allow the BOE to observe use cases for these digital assets while it evaluates its approach in more detail, said Bloomberg sources. As reported by Bitcoinist, the central bank is exploring the restriction of stablecoin ownership in the country, imposing a limit of £10,000 to £20,000 for individuals and £10 million for businesses on all systemic stablecoins. Notably, the BOE’s plan would reassemble its proposed approach to the digital pound, which aimed to address financial stability risks that deposits could flow out of the banking system. BOE executive director for financial market infrastructure, Sasha Mills, previously stated that the limits would “mitigate financial stability risks stemming from large and rapid outflows of deposits from the banking sector (…) and risks posed by newly recognised systemic payment systems as they are scaling up.” Some crypto industry and payment groups heavily criticized the central bank’s plan, arguing that it would be detrimental to the pound and put the UK at a disadvantage against the US and the European Union (EU). Simon Jennings, executive director of the UK Cryptoasset Business Council trade body, considers that “limits simply don’t work in practice.” He explained that “stablecoin issuers don’t have sight of who holds their tokens at any given time, so enforcing caps would require a costly, complex new system, such as digital IDs or constant co-ordination between wallets.” A Softer Crypto Stance? According to Bloomberg’s sources, the restrictions are expected to be included in a consultation paper that will be published by the end of the year. The BoE previously said its proposed cap could be “transitional” while the financial system adjusts to the growth of digital money. The report also noted that the potential exemptions could be seen as a shift from Governor Andrew Bailey’s skeptical perspective. Bailey has previously warned that stablecoins threaten to destabilize the public’s trust in money. In August, former Chancellor and member of Coinbase’s advisory council, George Osborne, criticized the Bailey and the government’s approach to the crypto industry, arguing that it risks being “left behind” during the second wave of digital assets if it doesn’t “catch up.” Osborne stated that authorities cannot continue to wait and evaluate the development of a digital revolution “reminiscent of Nigel Lawson’s Big Bang in the 1980s” while other financial capitals adopt comprehensive legislative frameworks for crypto asset platforms. Nonetheless, the BOE Governor has recently shared a softer approach, affirming that it would be “wrong to be against stablecoins as a matter of principle” and noting that they have the potential to drive “innovation in payments systems both at home and across borders.”",Crypto News|Andrew Bailey|Bank of England|bitcoin|BoE|btc|BTCUSDT|Digital Securities Sandbox|Stablecoin regulation|UK Crypto Legislation|UK regulators|UK stablecoins,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|FIAT|REGULATION|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-08 10:00:27

In 2010, Bitcoin was worth a few cents. One year later, it hit $20. In six years, it was $17,000, and now it’s sitting at over $110K, after hitting an ATH of $123K in July. Historically, if you’d invested in Bitcoin at launch, you’d have an ROI of 188,643,000%. The likes of Mastercard, JP Morgan, and scores of S&P 500 companies are buying Bitcoin in droves. There’s never been anything like Bitcoin before, and investors are waking up to that reality. However, Bitcoin is getting old for modern standards. No dApps, no smart contracts, and almost non-existent DeFi scalability. It needs an upgrade. And that’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is here to do with Layer-2 technology. Click to learn more about Bitcoin Hyper Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a crypto project planning to launch the fastest Layer-2 chain for Bitcoin. Its goal – to bring Bitcoin’s blockchain to modern standards. This means compatibility with dApps, smart contracts, and seamless DeFi programmability for developers. The L2 will run on a Canonical Bridge, combined with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), for native compatibility with Solana. You’ll be able to build token programs, LP logic, oracles, games, NFT infrastructure, DAOs, and much more. All without reinventing the wheel. To engage with the L2, you’ll deposit $BTC to a designated address monitored by the Canonical Bridge. The Relay Program verifies the details, and then mints an equivalent number of wrapped $BTC on the L2. You can also withdraw your original $BTC at any time. If you’re looking for the newest insights on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Hyper, you’re in the right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider insights for Bitcoin maxis and Bitcoin Hyper fans. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack!

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis After dropping over 2.5% yesterday, Bitcoin is up 1% today. Overall, we could be witnessing a healthy pullback following a one-sided 16% rally over the past couple of weeks. That said, even after yesterday’s correction, Bitcoin on the daily chart hasn’t yet touched the 10 EMA, suggesting it might be ideal if the token corrects a bit more, perhaps toward the 20 EMA. All in all, even if we see a deeper correction, say, down to around $118K – the last major resistance Bitcoin broke before hitting new all-time highs – it wouldn’t be a cause for concern. In fact, such a move would likely indicate that Bitcoin is simply accumulating strength before rallying harder toward new highs. However, Bitcoin is no stranger to explosive moves. Plus, seeing as the token has already found some support at the 50 EMA on the 4-hour chart, don’t be surprised if we see a new Bitcoin ATH in the next few hours. Bitcoin Blasts Past $126K as Inflows Hit Record High — Bitcoin Hyper Emerges as the Next Big Layer 2 Play October 8, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Bitcoin reached a new ATH of $126,200; meanwhile, weekly crypto ETPs/ETFs hit a record of $5.6B. Bitwise’s data shows that $BTC attracted a significant chunk of these inflows ($3.4B) with Ethereum following behind ($1.49B), reflecting Bitwise’s Bitcoin purchase driving this price rally. With the US dollar weakening, investors are redirecting capital into gold and Bitcoin, a trend known as the debasement trade, amid fiscal stress and rising deficits. Market data also supports the debasement trade phenomenon – DXY index dropped by 10% YTD while gold gained 50% and $BTC 27%. Furthermore, 49,158 $BTC were withdrawn from exchanges , meaning accumulation surpassed retail selling. The increased ETF inflows also underscore the limited retail speculation , which in turn reduces market volatility. This liquidity-rich backdrop sets the stage for new projects in the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , which is positioned to benefit from the ongoing bull run. Read more about Bitcoin Hyper price prediction in our detailed guide. 10-Year Simulations Show 50% Chance that $BTC Hits $140K in Uptober: Bitcoin Hyper Is Here to Join the Rally October 8, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Economist Timothy Peterson said this about Bitcoin: Half of Bitcoin’s October gains may have already happened, according to this AI simulation. There is a 50% chance Bitcoin finishes the month above $140k But there is a 43% chance Bitcoin finishes below $136k. —Timothy Peterson, X Post Hundreds of simulations over the last 10 years point to the same thing – October has been Bitcoin’s second-best month since 2013, with an average growth of 20.75%. Other analysts anticipate higher price points, which makes Peterson’s prediction extremely likely. Bitcoin’s last ATH was around $126.2, so there’s only an 11% leap to $140K – very achievable. The market remains highly confident in $BTC’s chances to shoot up – one analyst says it’s over for the bears as the bulls will take Bitcoin to higher ATHs. But imagine what Bitcoin could achieve if it had dApp and smart contract support (plus higher transaction speeds). That’s what Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) sets out to do in its $22.5M crypto presale. Read more about Bitcoin Hyper in our guide. The presale is viral right now, with whales buying over $143K in the last day ( $58.6K , for instance) and over $1M last week. Here’s how to buy Bitcoin Hyper if you’re interested.

Solana Surpasses Ethereum Early Growth with $2.85 Billion Revenue: Here’s the Next Crypto to Explode in Snorter Token October 8, 2025 • 10:00 UTC According to 21shares, Solana revenue is breaking every metric and expectation . January had a $616M revenue high, and we all remember the memecoin mania during late 2024 and early 2025. To compare, Ethereum’s monthly revenue was under $10M five years after launch. Solana is making about 20–30 times more now. $SOL ETFs and treasuries are also pushing the ship farther – last month, Nasdaq-listed Bera Holdings rebranded to Solmate and currently holds over 17.8M Solana. Others include Sharps Technology with 2.14M $SOL and Forward Industries (6.822M $SOL). The SEC is currently weighing the approval of several $SOL spot ETFs – Franklin Templeton, VanEck, Canary, and Fidelity are among the issuers. All this is to say that Solana is a heavyweight in the industry, and anything tied to it is bound to strike gold in the future. One such altcoin is Snorter Token ($SNORT) , which is building the fastest and cheapest Solana trading bot. It’s probably the best meme coin to buy now, especially with Solana’s explosive growth Here’s a comprehensive guide on what Snorter Token is planning for 2025.

This index aims to expose digital-asset economy to diversified access as it combines 15 cryptocurrencies with 35 publicly traded companies connected to the blockchain. S&P partnered with Dinari, a leading tokenized US equities firm to build this index. On other exciting news related to the index, Dinari will issue a tokenized version of the benchmark on its dShares platform. This step will allow global investors to gain exposure to both crypto assets and related equities in one product. The S&P’s digital-asset benchmark suite which already includes crypto and DeFi is now expanding with this move. This move reinforces S&P’s role as a leading data provider for institutional digital-assets space. Dinari cited on X that this collaboration highlights how blockchain technology can modernize traditional financial benchmarks, thereby enhancing transparency, accessibility, and global relevance.

AFL-CIO director Jody Calemine wrote, referring to the RFIA bill, “This bill’s treatment of crypto assets poses risks to both retirement funds and to the overall financial stability of the U.S. economy. As drafted, this bill will enable the crypto industry to operate in wider and deeper ways in our financial system without sufficient oversight or meaningful safeguards.” The AFL-CIO says the legislation will only augment the burden on FDIC-backed banks In its letter, the union federation noted that while it favours updating financial regulations to safeguard workers from crypto’s price instability, it believes the Responsible Financial Innovation Act would only do the opposite by encouraging risk exposure through 401(k)s and pension plans. The federation also cautioned that the bill could heighten systemic vulnerability by permitting FDIC-backed banks and their parent firms to engage in direct crypto trading and holdings. It claimed the proposal would only make banks more vulnerable to losses and failures, increasing the burden on the FDIC’s taxpayer-backed insurance fund. Additionally, it asserted that the bill’s support for legitimising tokenized assets will give private companies a way to issue stock-like products beyond SEC supervision. According to the organisation, tokenised versions of public stocks would form a parallel, unregulated market that exposes both crypto investors and traditional shareholders to new forms of risk and disrupts financial stability. The legislation, the group said, would erode critical enforcement powers at both the federal and state levels for pension plans by allowing tokenised securities to sidestep SEC regulation, limiting transparency, and nullifying state protections against fraud. It argued that at the moment, pensions avoid crypto investments due to the uncertainty and volatility surrounding them. However, this bill risks normalising those assets by presenting a veneer of regulation that could mislead investors into believing they are safe. The RFIA was originally introduced by Senators Lummis and Gillibrand in 2022 and was later revised this year. Currently, the Senate Banking Committee is advancing it as an alternative to the House’s CLARITY Act , proposing a distinct strategy for governing the crypto sector. The RFIA was first introduced in 2022 by Senators Lummis and Gillibrand, and amended earlier this year. Now, the Senate Banking Committee is pushing it forward as a counter to the House’s CLARITY Act, but with a different approach to regulating the crypto sector. AFL-CIO believes the bill risks contributing to a financial crisis like that of 2008 The AFL-CIO drew a direct comparison between today’s potential risks and the pre-crisis behaviours of banks that fueled the 2008 collapse. Calemine noted, “Banks engaging in crypto-based hedge fund trading activity, which would be allowed under this regime, could be even riskier than some of the dangerous financial activities conducted before the 2008 financial crisis.” He explained that the roots of the 2008 crisis lay in unchecked derivatives markets and widespread bank misconduct, which prompted support afterwards for reforms such as Dodd-Frank and the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). He added that the Responsible Financial Innovation Act would increase, rather than reduce, financial exposure, leaving consumers, workers, and the system itself more vulnerable. Noting that current rules already prohibit insured banks from engaging in high-risk crypto trading. He remarked, “As such, this legislation provides the perfect environment for the next financial crisis to germinate.” Overall, the federation is urging lawmakers to reject the bill to prevent financial disruptions.

52839494,https://timestabloid.com/?p=85672,1759917653,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is The Altcoin To Buy as Samsung and Coinbase Join Forces to Bring Crypto Trading to Galaxy Devices,https://timestabloid.com/why-mutuum-finance-mutm-is-the-altcoin-to-buy-as-samsung/,"Samsung and Coinbase have forged a partnership that integrates crypto trading directly into Galaxy devices for millions of users. This move grants automatic access to Coinbase One a premium service with zero trading fees and boosted staking rewards. Moreover it extends Samsung Pay’s existing crypto spending features easing the shift from traditional finance to decentralized options. Consequently, accessibility surges, drawing more people into crypto investments. Yet, amid this expansion, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as the altcoin to buy, offering robust lending tools that align perfectly with rising user demand for seamless DeFi access. Samsung Galaxy Partnership Accelerates Adoption Samsung continues to embed blockchain tools into its ecosystem. The company now delivers Coinbase One to all U.S. Galaxy smartphone owners without extra steps. Users gain priority support alongside exclusive deals that enhance trading efficiency. Furthermore, this ties into Samsung Pay’s wallet integration. Holders link their Coinbase wallets effortlessly, spending digital assets like everyday cash at merchants. Such features bridge Web3 innovations with mobile convenience, fostering broader crypto engagement. In addition, the alliance signals deeper global outreach. Both firms target expansions that merge decentralized finance with conventional banking. As a result, everyday devices become gateways to secure, on-the-go transactions, reshaping how people interact with crypto prices today. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) advances through its presale stages with strong investor interest. Phase 6, out of 11 total phases, now stands 60% complete. The project has raised $16,900,000 since the presale began, while total MUTM holders since presale began number 16,800. Phase 6 unfolds currently and sells out rapidly. Thus, opportunities to acquire tokens at $0.035 dwindle fast. This price marks a 250% rise, or 3.5x, from the phase one level of $0.01. Afterward, phase 7 opens soon, lifting the price 14.3% to $0.04. MUTM launches at $0.06, promising current buyers a 371% return post-launch. Such progression underscores smart crypto investment strategies in a dynamic market. Mutuum Lending Protocol Takes Shape Mutuum Finance has unveiled plans for its lending and borrowing protocol . Version 1 heads to Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Core elements include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bots, among others. Initial supported assets cover ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, or collateral use. Lenders deposit funds into shared pools, earning yields as borrowers access liquidity instantly. Borrowers post overcollateralized assets, retaining custody while unlocking value. Furthermore, the protocol employs dynamic interest rates tied to utilization. Abundant supply keeps rates low to spur borrowing; scarcity raises them to draw deposits. Stable rate options lock predictable costs for select users, though at a premium. In addition, safeguards like deposit caps limit exposure to volatile tokens. Borrow caps curb manipulation risks, ensuring protocol stability. Liquidation triggers activate at undercollateralized thresholds, with bonuses incentivizing swift resolutions. Certik Audit Bolsters Security The Mutuum Finance team has completed its Certik audit successfully. The token scan earned a 90/100 score, reflecting strong security measures. Moreover, Mutuum Finance launched a bug bounty program alongside Certik. It allocates $50,000 in USDT rewards across four tiers: critical, major, minor, and low severity. Each vulnerability level receives targeted incentives to fortify the system. Such steps enhance trust, vital for sustained crypto investing. Mutuum Community Initiatives Unfold Mutuum Finance recently introduced a dashboard featuring a leaderboard for the top 50 holders. These leaders earn bonus tokens as rewards for maintaining their ranks. Additionally, excitement builds around a major giveaway. The project awards $100,000 in MUTM tokens to 10 winners, each claiming $10,000 worth. Participants submit valid wallet addresses for secure prize delivery. They complete all required quests to boost odds. Eligibility demands a minimum $50 presale investment. These efforts cultivate a vibrant community, aligning with positive crypto predictions for DeFi growth. Borrowing Mechanics Promote Efficiency Mutuum Finance structures loans with overcollateralization to buffer price swings. Users borrow up to set loan-to-value ratios, like 75% for stable assets. Liquidation penalties apply if positions falter, funding protocol reserves. Reserve factors collect interest portions, higher for riskier tokens. Price oracles from Chainlink ensure accurate valuations, with fallbacks for reliability. Furthermore, enhanced collateral efficiency links correlated assets, raising borrowing power safely. These features optimize yields, making Mutuum a prime altcoin to buy for those investing in crypto. Strategic Entry Points Emerge As Samsung and Coinbase propel crypto trading into everyday devices, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself as the altcoin to buy. Its presale progress and protocol innovations highlight timely crypto investment potential. Investors now secure tokens at phase 6 rates, gearing up for launch gains and DeFi utility. Act promptly to join this evolving ecosystem through the ongoing presale.

It will expand its S&P Dow Jones Indices and collaborate with tokenized US securities provider Dinari. The index, as explained in S&P’s press release , will merges 15 cryptocurrencies with 35 publicly traded blockchain-linked equities. It’ll also introduce diversified exposure to digital-assets and bridge the gap between TradFi and DeFi. The equity portion of the index will include companies engaged in digital-asset operations, infrastructure, blockchain technology, and financial services. The crypto portion will consist of digital assets selected from S&P’s Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Market Index. This upcoming launch marks a significant milestone in S&P’s growing digital-asset offer, especially at a time when institutional demand for regulated cryptos is on the rise. Right now, this bold move places S&P ahead of its competitors, giving it good potential to capture a significant chunk of an expanding crypto market. And as institutional interest gives crypto more legitimacy, the positive news sparks retail participation as well. Not only in bluechip cryptos, but new altcoins with higher short-term potential. Cryptos like PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) and SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) are already emerging as the best altcoins to buy as market sentiment turns bullish. Here’s the lowdown on the new projects capturing the attention of everyday crypto investors. 1. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE): Gamified P2E Mining Experience with Rewards As the first mine-to-earn meme coin, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) offers an interactive blockchain game with real meme coin rewards for top scoring players. Unlike most memecoins that thrive purely on hype, PEPENODE combines GameFi mechanics, strategy, and community incentives, thereby creating a dynamic ecosystem to keep holders engaged. Launching on Ethereum after the token listing, the game lets you buy, upgrade, and optimize nodes to increase your mining power. The better your rig, the better your output and score. This ups your chance to land at the top of the player leaderboard. And PepeNode will reward you with meme coins like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN for your skill and participation. The best part? The game will be simple and lightweight enough to play on your browser or mobile. The project aims to make its P2E platform accessible to all with a simple setup, creating a sustainable model backed by real user activity. $PEPENODE’s token presale is equally impressive too — here’s a closer look. Having raised 1.7M+ so far, the project is already making waves and boasting community participation. $PEPENODE now sells for $0.0010918, with high staking rewards to boot (currently 741% APY). Whales are accumulating bags worth as much as $94.1K and $18.2K , signalling strong confidence. If our $PEPENODE price projections hold, the token could reach $0.0072 by 2026, giving this meme coin 6x potential in a bullish market. The next presale price jump is due in 30 hours. Grab $PEPENODE before it launches. 2. SUBBD Token ($SUBBD): A Project Combining AI, Crypto, and Content Creation SUBBD Token ($SUBBD) powers an AI-powered crypto creator platform. The project is on a mission to redefine the $85B online content industry. Built on Ethereum, SUBBD brings together premium content, staking rewards, and cutting-edge AI tools into a single Web3 ecosystem. The $SUBBD token lies at the center of this ecosystem, empowering creators and fans by enabling direct interaction, crypto payments, and exclusive content and commission requests. So, how does $SUBBD differ from other altcoins? It solves real issues for everyday users. Most online platforms today suffer from high fees, limited creative tools, and arbitrary restrictions, stripping creators of revenue and ownership. That’s where SUBBD enters. It eliminates intermediaries and offers an array of AI-powered tools – including voice, video, image, and profile generators – that help with automating content creation, management, and monetization. If you are a creator, you can scale your output, boost income, and retain complete control while your fans enjoy fair, transparent, and censorship-free content. If you are a fan, you can unlock premium content, send tips, make personalized content requests, and enjoy attractive discounts and perks as your $SUBBD holdings grow. Currently in presale, $SUBBD has raised $1.2M+, signaling strong investor support. Priced at $0.056625 with 20% fixed staking APY, this is one of the few tokens where rewards are stable over time. After launching on exchanges, $SUBBD could hit $0.48 by 2026 (a 8.5x potential return), if the most bullish $SUBBD price prediction plays out. Early investors are already stacking bags worth $11.5K and $11.4K , helping the presale blast through milestones. The next price jump is just 27 hours away. Secure your $SUBBD today for 20% APY. 3. BNB ($BNB) — The Fuel Behind Binance’s Fast, Low-Cost, and Scalable Ecosystem BNB ($BNB) is the native token of Binance , the biggest crypto exchange in the world. It has evolved into a core utility and governance asset for a vast Web3 ecosystem. $BNB follows ‘Build and Build’ philosophy, meaning it supports innovation while employing an auto-burn mechanism, thereby reducing total supply to 100M over time. What problem does $BNB solve? For starters, it combats high transaction fees and slow settlement in crypto networks by enabling fast, low-cost, and scalable blockchain operations. Another key advantage is the $BNB token unifying DeFi and CeFi utilities within a single ecosystem, bridging centralized and decentralized finance. Other key utilities include: Pay transaction fees on BNB Chain and DEXs using BNB Chain Stake or restake for yield and network security Participate in governance and decision-making Earn rewards via Launchpool, Vault, and other Binance programs Get trading fee discounts and access token launches on Binance Alt text: Past 1M market performance of $BNB. With a 50.46% price rally in the past 1M, $BNB touched its new ATH of $1300 yesterday surpassing $XRP and $Tether to claim third place in terms of market capitalization. The technical indicators too show a strong bullish phase for $BNB. MACD (12,26) at 87.87, signalling strong positive momentum and confirming buying pressure outweighing the selling activity. 10-day EMA (1176.91) and 20-day EMA (1099.75) are positioned well above the 50-day EMA, reflecting a clear bullish alignment (Bullish stack). These patterns prove that the short-term and medium-term trends are reigniting the long-term uptrend. Additionally, the widening gap between the EMAs indicates accelerating momentum and solid buying pressure. You can buy $BNB from Binance while $PEPENODE and $SUBBD are available through their presale websites. Quick Recap → S&P Global’s New Crypto Index is great news for institutional investors eyeing regulated crypto assets. But it also means bullish news for retail investors awaiting the next market surge. Right now, bluechip cryptos like $BTC and $ETH are getting a lot of attention, but emerging tokens like $SUBBD and $PEPENODE might see more inflows as capital rotates during the next altcoin season.

QCP: Bitcoin Could Be a Buying Opportunity as the Dollar Loses Strength According to the report, the US economy is on a softening but resilient course, with core inflation hovering around 3% and the possibility of a gradual easing of the Fed's policy stance emerging. According to QCP, the recent market pullback was not driven by policy, but by position adjustments. Rising long-term bond yields and a brief strengthening of the dollar triggered profit-taking in tech and AI stocks. However, the price of gold surpassed the $4,000 per ounce threshold, signaling a new safe-haven move. The firm assessed that “the Fed's more flexible and low-interest rate policy could create a 'Goldilocks' scenario for gold and Bitcoin.” In Asia, the Nikkei index rose following the Japanese election results, while a weakening yen and expansionary fiscal policies boosted regional risk appetite. QCP noted that this could also provide liquidity support to crypto markets during Asian trading hours. The report's overall assessment is that “when dollar strength weakens, Bitcoin declines should be viewed as buying opportunities.” The firm emphasized that while data shortages and geopolitical risks could create volatility in the short term, the long-term trend favors risk assets. *This is not investment advice.

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/pundit-one-day-1295-xrp-will-be-worth-1-2-million/,"For many retail investors in cryptocurrency, the story often begins with a quick surge of enthusiasm and a massive investment, but BD (@DiepSanh), a prominent figure in the XRP community, took a different route. He recently revealed that it took him 8 years to accumulate 1,295 XRP. In a post on X, he shared a screenshot of his XRP wallet balance alongside a note that he aimed to buy at least 3 XRP every week. His declaration caught attention because of the patience and consistency behind his strategy. The approach highlights persistence and a disciplined routine that few individual investors maintain over such a long period. He added an ambitious forecast for the future, writing, “One day 1295 XRP will be worth $1.2 million,” reflecting his confidence in XRP’s long-term growth. Took me 8 years to accumulate 1295 XRP Each week I aimed to buy at least 3 XRP One day 1295 XRP will be worth $1.2 million pic.twitter.com/gqxf3kSHat — BD (@DiepSanh) October 6, 2025 A Strong Belief in XRP’s Future BD’s post resonated in part because it demonstrates that he sees substantial potential for XRP far beyond its current price. While some may view his target valuation as highly optimistic, the comment reveals his faith in the asset’s ability to deliver long-term returns. This perspective aligns with a segment of the XRP community that believes the asset could gain significant value if adoption expands across financial institutions and payment networks. His journey also illustrates how consistent investment practices can build notable holdings even without large upfront capital. By setting a modest but regular purchase goal over several years, BD accumulated a balance that now motivates community members to follow a similar path. At XRP’s current price of $3, BD’s 1,295 XRP is worth about $3,885. To achieve his projected $1.2 million valuation, the asset’s price would need to climb dramatically to approximately $927. Community Reaction to His Dedication The responses to BD’s announcement were largely supportive, and many market participants showed respect for his perseverance. Some users congratulated him on the discipline it took to steadily buy XRP over nearly a decade. One user remarked that people often downplay slow and steady progress, and encouraged BD to keep going. Others praised his focus on investing without distractions and expressed admiration, with one noting that he had been following his posts since 2017. The responses collectively highlight that BD’s journey has become an example to many within the community who prioritize long-term value and commitment over short-term speculation.

YBTC's structure involves options on the iShares Bitcoin ETF, generating yield but not directly owning Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs. The ETF's high yield masks principal erosion and exposes investors to Bitcoin's volatility, resulting in wide swings and lower total returns than IBIT. Risk management strategies, such as pairing YBTC with inverse ETFs, can help moderate volatility, but investors should weigh yield against potential capital loss. Look at them, folks. Covering the plate like a gift from the heavens. Until they make us wish we hadn't gone anywhere near them. Sure, I'm talking from personal experience about hot ""Buffalo"" chicken wings. But that's one of many analogies I find between that tasty yet dangerous (to some of us) bar food favorite and an ETF known as the Roundhill Bitcoin Covered Call Strategy ETF ( YBTC ). If you have studied up on covered call ETFs the last few years, you will likely read this article one way. And if you are still fairly new to them or to ETFs in general, you will probably get something different out of it. Either way, I hope this assessment of YBTC adds to your ongoing understanding of this very popular but very risky market segment. To me, buffalo wings are a consistent metaphor for investing in an ETF like YBTC, which takes the idea of owning Bitcoin but as a base to earn a very high rate of income. YBTC does that, as dozens of other YieldMax ETFs do, through a combination of options trades that create a structure that simulates owning a Bitcoin ETF and getting covered call income from it. A lot of covered call income! This ETF has a lot of spice to it. No grilled chicken with lemon happening with YBTC. It pays a weekly dividend, which to retirement income fans is like the scent wafting through the restaurant when you walk in, a few minutes before football kickoff time. However, that expense ratio, gently tucked just under an even 1%, means you are paying for the complexity here. Seeking Alpha I will always pay up for something I consider to be of value. For this, I'm more likely to pass. I have not owned it to this point, and it is frankly not high on my radar. But I do think this ETF is going to attract some buzz as it approaches its second full year. And that it has accumulated more than $300 million in assets that quickly, from an ETF producer that is not a top-tier firm, e.g., iShares, means that it is getting some attention. It also trades pretty actively on a daily basis. OK, so I'm nearly 400 words into this, and I have not yet mentioned the main reason investors buy ETFs like this one: just look at that yield! OK, the exclamation point was borrowed by me from many investors who insist on crowding into covered call ETFs with high yields. This is far from a new subject for me, as my regular readers know. And once again, I'm stating, as I have before, I don't dislike covered call ETFs. I just think they are overrated. And while it is neither my role nor my responsibility to tell others what to do with their income-objective assets (that was my old job for 27 years as an investment advisor, now retired), I see potential for a toxic combination here: covered call income that masks erosion of principal over time and the potential for Bitcoin to have more extended slumps. Bitcoin and AI have something in common: they are new, exciting business areas that people continue to pile into. And at this point, they are still quite a distance from sustained, proven ability to create monetization results. Yet for many, I still sense it is more about ""number go up"" than knowing what they own. Tell Me More About the Buffalo Wings/YBTC Similarities Yes, thanks for reminding me. Here we go: YBTC's holdings are like a wing sauce recipe. You have a pretty good idea of what's in them. But there's always a chance there's that extra ingredient that can turn a tangy flavor into a living nightmare. Though it won't be apparent right away. Here are this ETF's recent holdings. As is typically the case with these vehicles, they own US T-bills to back the purchase and short sale of options. Roundhill ETFs Specifically, above we see a combination of: A purchased call option on iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ), the largest and most liquid Bitcoin ETF, which debuted in early 2024, a couple of weeks before YBTC launched. A put option sold at the same strike price and expiration date as the call purchase. A covered (sold short) call option on IBIT, about 8% above the strike price of the call, and to an expiration date a week prior to the expiration date of the purchased call option. This is THE main income driver, so this snapshot indicates to me that the purchased calls are typically set up to expire about a month out, while the covered calls are sold weekly. Thus, the income can be distributed to shareholders weekly. Note that the call is technically ""covered"" because if the fund was forced to sell IBIT via being called, it could convert the ""long"" call options it owns into IBIT shares to meet that call event. That could be the case if IBIT rises in price. Likewise, the put sale allows the fund to be in a position to come up with the IBIT shares if that ETF falls in price. Taken together, this is known as a ""synthetic"" approach to ""owning"" IBIT. And once you own IBIT, you can write calls and earn income. Every week. But the ETF doesn't actually own any Bitcoin or Bitcoin ETFs directly. And while there's always a risk that IBIT option liquidity can dry up, it is less likely with a fund like IBIT. Not impossible, but less likely than, say, a small-cap stock's option market experiencing a spread that ""blows out"" and messes everyone up who is involved. And that all leads me to another buffalo wings/YBTC similarity. They both look a lot neater from a distance, before you really dig into them. But once you do, it's what I like to call an ""organized mess."" Let's finish this with a side of cool ranch and celery sticks. Oh, sorry, I mean by looking at how YBTC has done so far. Because it has been stress-tested during its short tenure. YBTC's 3-month total return range has been in excess of 50% and, on multiple occasions, below -20%. It is prone to wild swings. Not to be confused with ""wild wings."" Data by YCharts So far, YBTC investors have settled for 1/2 the total return of what IBIT, and essentially Bitcoin, have delivered since YBTC's inception in January of 2024. Data by YCharts That gaudy income rate has offset the fact that YBTC's non-income component has declined 9% thus far. So as long as IBIT doesn't suffer a sustained, steep slump, and as long as Bitcoin volatility stays as high as it has been historically, there's a lot of income to be gained here. Without enough price slippage to matter to many holders, I suspect. Data by YCharts The yield has remained quite stable this year, a good sign. The question is whether Bitcoin will correlate with other risk assets, which would make YBTC prone to stock market declines in the future. That's forward-looking, since so far this has not been an issue. What Can YBTC Investors Do to Soften the Volatility? As I've mentioned in past articles, many target underlying securities that have covered call ETFs associated with them also have inverse ETFs. That's the case with Bitcoin as well. To provide a visual, see how YBTC and this 2x short Bitcoin ETF move in polar opposite directions. That makes sense, given that they have roughly opposite objectives, apart from YBTC trading off a lot of price potential for income. Data by YCharts Finally, to provide just a glimpse of what is possible by combining either inverse ETFs or perhaps put options with the option-infused YBTC, here's the past 12 months total return path of YBTC, the S&P 500 ETF (SPY), and an 80%/20% mix of YBTC and the ProShares UltraShort Bitcoin ETF ( SBIT ) shown in the chart above. YCharts (Sungarden Investment Publishing) This shows potential to cushion the blow and deliver a return that is more focused on shrinking the range of possible outcomes with a ""wildcard"" situation that is combining options on a new ETF with Bitcoin to create another new ETF ((YBTC)). The tradeoffs are clear, but that purple line showing the mix did deliver an S&P 500-like return over this snapshot time frame. And both components of that mix still produce yield, albeit much less cash flow than YBTC on its own. Concluding Thoughts on Risk Management, YBTC, and Buffalo Chicken Wings I'm a risk manager, through and through. That doesn't mean you have to be. This article was intended to explore the ""hot topic"" that is the intriguing yet complex and rapidly expanding world of covered call ETFs. And as a risk manager, my own natural inclination is to say, ""How can I try to get a chunk of that enormous yield from YBTC but not risk as much as I'd need to?"" You know, sort of like deciding to have 1 or 2 wings at the sports bar while watching the game. Instead of downing 2 dozen of them (as young Rob Isbitts used to). Fewer napkins sounds pretty good to me.

A massive on-chain transaction has caught the crypto community’s attention after over $55.9 million worth of XRP was moved from a Ripple wallet to a Ripple-linked address, according to data flagged by Whale Alert. The transfer, first highlighted by renowned market expert Xaif Crypto, has sparked intense speculation about Ripple’s next move amid growing market anticipation. The transfer involved more than 18.7 million XRP tokens, reigniting debates about Ripple’s liquidity management strategies and potential preparations for significant corporate or market developments. While internal transfers between Ripple-controlled wallets are not uncommon, the timing and scale of this transaction have raised eyebrows, especially as XRP’s price continues to consolidate within a critical technical range. Xaif Crypto noted that such transfers often precede key events, ranging from institutional distribution, OTC settlements, or reserve rebalancing, to more strategic actions like exchange listings or ecosystem partnerships. Despite the mystery, market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic. XRP continues to trade near key resistance levels, with many traders viewing the move as a bullish signal of confidence from Ripple’s side rather than a sell-off attempt. Historically, similar whale movements have preceded strategic partnerships or major network updates, fueling speculative optimism among holders. High-Stakes Liquidity Battle Looms as XRP Teeters Between Bullish Defense and $500M Long Squeeze According to market commentator Tom Tucker, XRP is entering a critical juncture that could define its short-term trajectory. The cryptocurrency, which has shown resilience amid volatile market conditions, now faces a high-stakes liquidity battle between bullish defenders and bearish momentum traders. Tucker warns that a close below key support levels could trigger a massive $500 million long squeeze, potentially driving XRP down to the $2.73-$2.89 range. Such a move could trigger mass liquidations of overleveraged positions across major exchanges, amplifying volatility and driving prices lower. Notably, liquidity can disappear in an instant, if current demand zones collapse, automated liquidations may cascade at lightning speed. However, it’s not all bearish for XRP bulls. Tucker notes that if the market holds above key support and absorbs sell-side pressure, stop-run rallies toward $3.20–$3.40 could emerge, signaling potential whale and institutional accumulation aimed at trapping shorts before a bullish reversal. Therefore, this could be a textbook liquidity grab, with bulls and bears battling for control at a critical inflection point. The $3.00 psychological level has become a magnet for liquidity, as traders wait to see which side breaks first. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.87 per CoinGecko data. Conclusion Ripple’s $55.9 million XRP transfer isn’t just a routine transaction, it’s a calculated move that hints at deeper strategic intentions. Whether it signals liquidity positioning ahead of a major partnership, institutional settlement, or a broader market play, the timing couldn’t be more critical. As Xaif Crypto suggests, when whales move, they move with purpose, and the crypto market is now bracing for what could be Ripple’s next defining moment. On the other hand, XRP stands at a razor’s edge, a battleground where liquidity, leverage, and sentiment converge. Whether the next move triggers a $500 million long squeeze or ignites a bullish breakout toward $3.40, the coming sessions will likely define the asset’s short-term fate.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-08 10:05:06

Learn more. What is the Forward Industries Solana validator launch? Forward Industries Solana validator is an institutional-grade node launched by Forward Industries that immediately staked approximately 6.8 million SOL (about $1.6–1.7 billion) to join Solana’s top 10 validators. The validator uses DoubleZero’s fiber network and Jump Crypto’s Firedancer client to support network resiliency. How did Forward Industries stake its treasury and who backs the move? Forward Industries publicly launched the validator after moving its entire Solana treasury—reported at roughly $1.6 billion—into a single validator. The company is backed by institutional crypto investors including Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto and Multicoin Capital. Kyle Samani, Forward’s chairman, said the validator helps fortify Solana for institutional adoption. Corporate entities holding Solana tokens in their treasuries.

Major validators by staked amount remain Binance Staking, Helius, Figment and Jupiter, each with over 10 million SOL staked. Top 10 validators by the amount of Solana staked. Source: Solana Beach Why is Forward offering a 0% commission and what does it mean for delegators? 0% commission means Forward will not take a fee from staking rewards, so all validator rewards can accrue to delegators. Commissions generally fund validator infrastructure; common top operators charge between 1% and 8% (example figures: Binance Staking ~1%, Figment ~7%, Coinbase ~8%). Forward’s 0% is likely a growth tactic to attract delegations, though commission rates can change over time as operational costs rise. What infrastructure powers Forward’s validator? The validator runs on DoubleZero’s fiber network and uses Firedancer, an independent Solana validator client developed by Jump Crypto. These components aim to improve throughput and resiliency for institutional-grade operations. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How much SOL did Forward Industries stake?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Forward Industries staked approximately 6.8 million SOL, equal to roughly $1.6–1.7 billion, moving its entire reported Solana treasury into a single validator."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Does Forward charge commission on staking rewards?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The validator launched with a 0% commission, meaning Forward does not take a cut of staking rewards at present, allowing delegators to receive full validator rewards before any network or inflation effects."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Which technologies power the validator?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The validator runs on DoubleZero's fiber network and uses Jump Crypto's Firedancer client to enhance performance and resiliency."" } } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How does staking with Forward impact delegator yields? Delegators benefit from Forward’s 0% commission because rewards are not reduced by validator fees. Actual yield still depends on network inflation and overall validator performance. Delegators should consider uptime and governance practices when delegating. Will Forward keep 0% commission permanently? 0% commission may be a strategic acquisition tactic. Running a validator incurs real infrastructure costs, so operators sometimes raise commissions later. Monitor Forward’s published validator parameters for updates. Key Takeaways Immediate top-10 status : Forward staked ~6.8M SOL, entering Solana’s top 10 validators. Institutional infrastructure : Validator runs on DoubleZero fiber and uses Jump Crypto’s Firedancer client for resiliency. Delegator benefit : 0% commission maximizes rewards for delegators, though future commission changes are possible.
