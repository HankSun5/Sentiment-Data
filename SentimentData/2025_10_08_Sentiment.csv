On-chain metrics show increasing whale accumulation, showcasing faith in the direction of XRP in the near term. But before XRP is basking in the spotlight, investors are eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a DeFi utility token currently at just $0.035. With its Stage 6 presale more than 60% complete with over 16,770 holders, Mutuum Finance is slowly but surely emerging as the next crypto to explode, with early-stage expansion potential being derived from a well-founded fundamentals platform which most feel has the potential to outperform even top altcoins this quarter. XRP at Crossroads as Bulls and Bears Wage War for Control XRP is closely banded at writing in the $3 level, with traders watching how long the bulls will hold. A breakdown of this level can unlock a $500 million long squeeze that can move the price as low as $2.89–$2.73 levels. In the other case if the bullish pressure continues, XRP can see stop-run rallies test levels of $3.20–$3.40 as buyers sustain important support levels. During this risky liquidity war, interest is shifting to newer altcoins with more well-structured growth potential, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is one such utility-driven entrant that is gaining growing interest from investors. Mutuum Finance Presale Frenzy Suggests Market Confidence Boost Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is giving early investors a special opportunity to buy tokens at a discounted rate before public listing. Phase 6 tokens at $0.035 have already seen high demand, raising more than $16.9 million from more than 16,770 buyers. Such high participation indicates increased global faith in the long-term potential of the project and DeFi vision. As a token of appreciation to its early adopters, Mutuum Finance is offering $100,000 giveaway in a competition in which 10 lucky winners will receive $10,000 MUTM tokens each. It also incentivizes early adoption, participation, and loyalty from the community. Mutuum Finance places utmost priority on security. With the help of CertiK, the project has initiated a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program. White-hat hackers, developers, and security experts are invited to report vulnerabilities, which are ranked in severity: critical, major, minor, and low, and rewarded in proportion. Even small errors are fixed in real-time to provide the optimal platform security. Next-Generation Lending and Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance will launch its revolutionary lending and borrowing protocol , solidifying its position in DeFi even more. Version 1 (V1) will be released on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, and its key components will include a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. The protocol will also provide ETH and USDT lending, borrowing, and collateralization from day one. The platform is designed for usability, scalability, and speed and aims to provide secure DeFi to retail and institutional clients. Mutuum Finance applies dynamic Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios and liquidation levels in real-time, automatically calibrating against market conditions in order to be shielded from volatility. Reserve multipliers ranging from 10% on low-risk assets to 35% on high-risk assets also offer a level of protection. Collateral management is designed to maximize borrowing power and matched collateral for lending and borrowing efficiency. Remediation charges and undercollateralized position charges in real-time stabilize the platform, reduce systemic risk, and ensure a safe, stable, and resilient DeFi environment. Ripple (XRP) vs Mutuum Finance (MUTM): A Comparison As Ripple (XRP) tees up for a solid Uptober, tightrope walking between support levels at $3 and potential rallies toward $5, investors are searching increasingly for early-stage, high-utility substitutes within the DeFi space. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is at a low of only $0.035 and over 60% of Stage 6 presale sold, is a strong play. Its dual lending protocol, next-gen borrowing/lending platform, adaptive Loan-to-Value ratios, and strong collateral management provide security with scalability and will be ideal for retail as well as institutional players. With bug bounty programs, community incentives, and a clear-cut presale, MUTM blends prospective early adoption with real-world DeFi use cases to make it one of the best under-$1 cryptos to watch this quarter.

Recent analysis from crypto researchers reveals that the token is not waiting for a direct partnership with SWIFT. Instead, Ripple’s technology is making inroads through a network of third-party fintech providers that already connect to SWIFT, offering multiple entry points or backdoor routes to the network’s 11,000 financial institutions. Fintech Providers To Enable XRP To Flow Through SWIFT According to crypto enthusiast Peter Bourg, a recent thread by market researcher “@SMQKEDQG” on X social media outlined how seven prominent fintech firms are serving as active bridges between XRP and SWIFT. These companies—ACI, EastNets, Finastra, TAS, Temenos, Volange, and CGI—already support ISO 20022 -compliant cross-border payment systems. This means they can handle data-rich financial messages that enable faster, more transparent, and standardized settlement. Bourg added that Thunes , another fintech network with significant global reach, can now be added to the list, reinforcing XRP’s growing access to SWIFT’s ecosystem. He stated that with this collective fintech framework, there would be no need for a direct XRP-SWIFT collaboration . Instead, the cryptocurrency would leverage existing SWIFT-connected infrastructure that already has compliance and certification under the global telecommunications network’s evolving payment standards. Based on Bourg’s post, partnerships such as Ripple’s alliance with Finastra since 2019 and its integration with Temenos for real-time settlements are tangible examples of how the altcoin can easily move within SWIFT’s system. He says that these integrations provide verified “entry points” that adhere to CBPR+ standards for blockchain and interoperability , into SWIFT’s 11,000 institutions. The crypto enthusiast also highlighted SWIFT’s recent shift toward an API-based messaging structure through its new Transaction Management Platform (TMP), noting that the move further supports XRP’s role in faster settlements. He added that this transformation challenges the narrative of unproven competitors while underscoring the strength of SWIFT’s existing infrastructure . Interestingly, a member of the XRP community questioned whether these seven fintech firms could represent the 14% of SWIFT’s volume that Ripple’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, mentioned months ago. Bourg responded, cautioning that the true value of the firms does not lie in percentages but in adoption. How ISO 20022 And CBPR+ Are Powering The Token’s Entry Into SWIFT Going back to Bourg’s referenced analysis by crypto expert SMQKE on X, the post elaborated that XRP’s pathway into SWIFT’s network is already operational through the previously mentioned third-party fintech providers. He noted that the integrated strategy hinges on Ripple aligning with global standards , specifically ISO 20022 and CBPR+. ISO 20022 provides a universal language for electronic payments, while CBPR+ extends this to cross-border transactions, ensuring compatibility between blockchain and traditional financial systems. SMQKE explained that Ripple’s fintech partners provide the technological backbone that allows the XRP Ledger to process and settle international payments with speed and transparency, without breaching SWIFT’s compliance rules or requiring explicit endorsement. Through these connections, XRP can also move across borders more efficiently, serving as a bridge currency between fiat pairs.",XRP|ACI|Brad Garlinghouse|CBPR+|CGI|EastNets|Finastra|Peter Bourg|ripple|SMQKE|SWIFT|TAS|Temenos|TMP|Transaction Management Platform|Volange|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-07 22:00:25

This comes as the flagship crypto continues to hit new all-time highs (ATHs), with the $130,000 target now in sight. Bitcoin Supply On Exchanges Hit Six-Year Low Glassnode data shows that the Bitcoin supply on exchanges has fallen to a six-year low of around 2.8 million BTC. The last time the BTC balance on exchanges was this low was in June 2019, when the flagship crypto was trading at around $8,745. This development confirms that investors are accumulating Bitcoin at an unprecedented pace. CryptoQuant data also confirms this development, with the Bitcoin exchange reserve currently at 2.5 million BTC, even lower than what is shown on Glassnode’s dashboard. This is bullish for the BTC price, as such massive demand usually precedes a major supply squeeze. Notably, this comes amid an increased demand from institutional investors, with the BTC ETFs recording $3.2 billion in weekly inflows last week, their second-largest since their launch last year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Still On Track To Hit $165,000, JPMorgan Analysts Reveal Timeline This comes as institutional investors move to Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset as part of the debasement trade during this period of uncertainty caused by the U.S. government shutdown. Thanks to the increased demand, BTC is already up 9% to start this month and rallied to multiple all-time highs amid the ‘Uptober’ rally. The Bitcoin price topped $126,000 for the first time ever yesterday and now looks on course to test the $130,000 milestone. With the massive demand from the BTC ETFs, there is the belief that the flagship crypto could hit this milestone this month. SoSo Value data shows that these funds took in $1.19 billion in net inflows yesterday, their highest daily inflow this year. BTC Could Break Above $130,000 Crypto analyst Titan of Crypto has suggested that Bitcoin is on track to make a new all-time high (ATH) above $130,000. He noted that BTC is testing the same trendline that rejected it a few weeks ago. However, this time around, the weekly MACD is crossing bullish, which could spark the rally above $130,000. His accompanying chart showed that a rally to as high as $140,000 was a possibility if the flagship crypto flips $130,000 into support. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s 2021 Playbook Shows The Final Price Target For This Bull Cycle Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto also noted that Bitcoin is currently facing resistance around its current price level, making it a key level to watch. He added that a meaningful breakout above this level will send BTC to between $136,000 and $150,000. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $124,500, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

The rally follows growing optimism around a newly propose blockchain. APT’s resurgence comes at a time when the broader market is recovering from short-term volatility, with Bitcoin consolidating near $122,000 and Ethereum climbing above $4,500. The combination of institutional attention and improved network activity has pushed Aptos back into the spotlight as traders look for the next breakout asset. At the same time, retail investors seeking even higher upside are turning toward early-stage opportunities such as MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-rising presale project that analysts believe could deliver up to 50x returns after listing. Aptos-linked ETF filing in Europe, which has reignited interest in the high-performance Layer- ETF Filing Sparks Renewed Optimism The Aptos ETF proposal submitted by a European asset management firm is being viewed as a major step toward broader institutional adoption of emerging blockchain networks. The filing, which aims to offer regulated exposure to APT, has already started shifting sentiment across the market. Unlike past cycles, this move highlights a growing willingness among financial institutions to back alternatives to Ethereum. Analysts note that if the ETF gains approval, the issuer would need to purchase APT directly, reducing circulating supply and potentially fueling further price appreciation. On-chain data supports this renewed optimism. Daily active addresses on the Aptos network have risen by 20 percent in the last month, and total transaction volume has reached a six-month high. Developer activity is also climbing as more decentralized applications begin integrating with the network’s Move-based smart contract system. Technical indicators suggest that if APT can hold above $5.40, the next target lies near the $6.20 zone. A clean breakout above that level could open the path to $7 and beyond, potentially marking a full recovery to its early-year highs. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Next 50x Prospect While Aptos is seeing strong institutional interest, retail traders are chasing even higher potential returns – and MAGACOIN FINANCE has become the most talked-about presale project in that category. The token has already raised over $15.5 million, breaking multiple participation records in the process. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s growing reputation is based on a combination of solid fundamentals and well-managed excitement. The project has been fully audited by HashEx and CertiK, providing investors with assurance that its code and tokenomics are secure. This emphasis on transparency has built confidence among small and mid-size investors who want exposure to early opportunities without excessive risk. What’s truly fueling the buzz, however, is the forecasted 50x upside potential . Analysts point to its low initial valuation, strong community backing, and limited supply as key reasons why MAGACOIN could outperform established tokens once it lists on major exchanges. Unlike speculative meme coins, MAGACOIN’s development roadmap focuses on long-term ecosystem growth and community governance. The project’s commitment to continuous progress, rather than short-term marketing, is helping it stand out as one of the few presales that balance ambition with accountability. Institutional Momentum and Market Rotation The Aptos ETF filing is also part of a broader trend of renewed institutional engagement with altcoins. After the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, large funds are diversifying into new blockchain ecosystems. Analysts believe that as institutional exposure widens, confidence in the altcoin sector will grow, paving the way for fresh capital inflows. Meanwhile, retail investors are taking advantage of this momentum by moving into smaller, high-upside assets. The ongoing market rotation is shifting liquidity from large caps into emerging tokens and presales. This pattern often precedes major altcoin rallies, as smaller projects gain traction ahead of widespread recognition. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s strong presale performance fits perfectly within this trend. With early investors securing low entry prices and the project gaining international attention, it has become a leading example of where the market’s most active retail segment is placing its bets. Outlook for Aptos and the Wider Market Aptos has regained its reputation as one of the fastest-growing Layer-1 ecosystems thanks to a mix of strong fundamentals, new institutional exposure, and rising developer engagement. If the ETF filing advances smoothly, it could further strengthen Aptos’ position as one of the top-performing networks of 2025. At the same time, the explosive demand for presales like MAGACOIN FINANCE shows that the appetite for early-stage growth remains alive and well. With projections of up to 50x returns, it is capturing the same kind of enthusiasm that once surrounded now-established tokens like Solana and Avalanche during their formative years. Conclusion Aptos’ 30% weekly surge has reminded investors that strong narratives and institutional moves still drive market momentum. The ETF filing has brought new energy to the project and positioned APT as a key player in the next stage of the bull market. But while Aptos appeals to institutions, retail investors are gravitating toward the early growth phase of MAGACOIN FINANCE – a project designed to combine long-term structure with the potential for exponential returns. Together, they reflect the two sides of crypto’s future: institutional maturity and retail innovation.

The altcoin has been pressing against the level since the weekend, sitting at a critical crossroads between a breakout and a rejection.

Source: TradingView. Flipping this level to support would confirm the move, targeting a retest of the $3.68 high and a potential 80% move to $5.25 . However, momentum indicators caution a rejection. The RSI has plummeted below the neutral line with today’s XRP price drawdown, suggesting mounting sell pressure. It appears enough to affect the wider trend, with the MACD en route to cross below the signal line in a potential death cross—often a marker of local tops for the XRP price. In this scenario, $2.70 is the key XRP price floor to maintain the pattern’s structure. Losing it could open the door to a steeper 30% decline toward June lows at $1.90.

According to data from Farside Investors, Bitcoin ETFs attracted $1.19 billion in net inflows on Monday, the highest single-day total since July 10, when inflows reached $1.18 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) dominated the surge, accounting for more than 81% of total inflows with $970 million added in a single day. Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) followed with $112.3 million, while Bitwise’s BITB recorded $60.1 million. BlackRock’s IBIT Leads Record $6B Crypto ETF Inflows The renewed appetite for Bitcoin exposure coincides with a major milestone for BlackRock’s IBIT, which has now overtaken some of the firm’s legacy funds to become its highest-revenue-generating ETF. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted that IBIT is now “a hair away from $100 billion” in assets under management (AUM), just 21 months after launch. $IBIT a hair away from $100 billion, is now the most profitable ETF for BlackRock by a good amount now based on current aum.

Absurd. pic.twitter.com/E8ZMI2wynx — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) October 6, 2025 The fund currently manages $98.47 billion across 1.38 billion shares with a 0.25% fee, generating roughly $244 million in annual revenue for the world’s largest asset manager. Monday’s inflows also capped off a record week for Bitcoin-linked investment products. Data from CoinShares showed that digital asset funds globally attracted $5.95 billion last week, the largest weekly inflow on record. Source: CoinShares Bitcoin accounted for $3.55 billion of that figure, while Ethereum saw $1.48 billion, followed by Solana and XRP with $706.5 million and $219.4 million, respectively. Bitcoin itself has been trading just below all-time highs, hovering around $124,500 on Tuesday after briefly crossing $126,000 earlier in the week. The latest surge came as institutional traders piled in over the weekend, sending Bitcoin past $125,000 for the first time since August. October has historically been one of Bitcoin’s stronger months, and the token is already up more than 10% since the start of the month. Data from SoSoValue shows that as of October 6, total cumulative net inflows into U.S. Bitcoin spot ETFs reached $61.26 billion, with total assets under management now at $169.54 billion, representing about 6.8% of Bitcoin’s total market capitalization. Source: SoSoValue Meanwhile, Ethereum spot ETFs have also benefited from the broader crypto rebound. As of October 6, they recorded $181.7 million in daily inflows and $14.6 billion in cumulative inflows, with total net assets now sitting at $32 billion, about 5.6% of Ethereum’s market capitalization. Bitcoin Faces Short-Term Correction After Record Rally, Analysts Eye Key Support Levels Bitcoin slipped 4.2% on Tuesday to around $122,000 after hitting an all-time high of $126,219 the previous day, pausing a week-long 12.5% surge. While the pullback sparked concerns of a deeper correction, derivatives data and institutional flows suggest the broader uptrend remains intact. Bitcoin monthly futures continue to trade at an 8% annualized premium over spot prices, a level that reflects steady optimism without signs of speculative overheating. Analysts say this moderation helps reduce liquidation risk if prices fall further. The rally that began after Bitcoin’s $109,000 retest in late September appears supported by genuine inflows, with bulls defending the $120,000 zone. Exchange data reinforces that narrative. Glassnode reports Bitcoin balances on trading platforms have dropped to a five-year low of 2.38 million BTC, down from 2.99 million a month earlier, indicating ongoing accumulation. The firm also identifies strong support near $117,000, where around 190,000 BTC last changed hands. Open interest in Bitcoin futures stands at $72 billion, slightly lower on the day but still showing deep market participation. Meanwhile, VanEck analysts project Bitcoin could eventually capture half of gold’s market capitalization, potentially reaching $644,000 per coin. Technically, Bitcoin is testing key support near its 200-day exponential moving average around $122,900. Analyst Ted Pillow noted that momentum has weakened after the failure to hold above $125,000. As said yesterday, $BTC is losing steam. Bitcoin is testing key support around the 200 EMA (~$122,900). Showing weakening short-term momentum after failing to hold recent highs.

A close below $122,900 could trigger a… https://t.co/loOr8Tulm7 — Ted (@TedPillows) October 7, 2025 A close below $122,900 could trigger a pullback toward $121,000, while a rebound above $125,500 would restore bullish momentum. Short-term charts show Bitcoin consolidating between a seller zone at $123,000–$125,000 and a strong buyer zone near $112,000–$114,000. Multiple rejections around the upper band suggest short-term exhaustion, though the broader structure remains bullish. Market analysts say a correction toward $118,000 would be a “healthy retracement” within Bitcoin’s larger uptrend, a phase that could reset leverage and prepare the market for another leg higher.

The token is up 21% year-to-date, making it the weakest performer in the top five, while Ethereum and BNB Coin have already hit new all-time highs with gains of 41% and 85% respectively. But that could be about to change. In September, Solana validators approved the Alpenglow upgrade – a major technical enhancement that will reduce block times from 12 seconds to just 150 milliseconds, bringing Solana closer than ever to real-time speed. The network already ranks third in total value locked for real-world assets, with $14.7 billion in stablecoins and tokenized assets – double that of BNB Chain, though still behind Ethereum’s $183 billion. Still, with Wall Street increasingly moving into tokenization, Alpenglow could position Solana at the center of the next wave of institutional crypto adoption. And if momentum builds, the road to $1,000 SOL might arrive sooner than expected. Solana Price Prediction: Big Upside Potential If SOL Breaks Through $300 Solana has found firm support at the $200 psychological level during the latest market dip, and now looks primed to make a move toward new all-time highs. With altcoin season heating up , SOL may soon start catching up to top performers like BNB Coin (BNB) and Ethereum (ETH) . The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has just flashed a buy signal, crossing above its 14-day moving average while gaining strength near the mid-line. If momentum pushes SOL beyond $300 , it could trigger the next leg of the rally – and open the door for a longer-term move toward $1,000 . Alongside major altcoins, top crypto presales are gaining serious attention, offering early access to potential breakout projects. One project that is currently gaining attention is SUBBD ($SUBBD) , a decentralized content platform built for the AI era. It’s gaining traction fast as investors look for early access to the next breakout presale. SUBBD ($SUBBD) Gives Creators the Chance to Monetize AI-Generated Content SUBBD ($SUBBD) is reshaping how creators make, share, and monetize their work by merging AI tools with blockchain technology in one seamless platform. Instead of juggling multiple apps for generating content, editing, and posting, SUBBD lets users do all of this within the same ecosystem.

Bitcoin price outlook: BTC near $122k with upside potential to $140k by year-end—read analyst insights and key signals to watch. Learn more. What is the Bitcoin price outlook? Bitcoin price outlook shows continued upside potential after a recent pullback from record highs. Short-term volatility is expected, but macro factors—rising fiscal deficits, lower real rates, and ETF inflows—support further appreciation as investors seek hedges against dollar weakness. Could Bitcoin reach $140,000 by year-end? Analysts cited by COINOTAG believe BTC could surpass $140,000 by year-end if institutional demand and the so-called debasement trade persist. Bitcoin recently traded at $122,071, down 3.1% from a $126,080 peak, according to CoinGecko. Hashdex highlighted BTC’s narrative as a borderless store-of-value, while Pepperstone noted rising ETF holdings and inflows as validation. How can investors assess Bitcoin’s outlook? Track capital flows: Monitor ETF inflows and institutional position reports to gauge demand trends. Watch macro signals: Rising U.S. fiscal deficits, falling real rates, and dollar weakness typically support the debasement trade. Compare safe-haven assets: Evaluate correlations with gold and other hedges to confirm flight-to-quality behavior.

Why are analysts comparing Bitcoin to gold? Analysts say Bitcoin and gold share hedge characteristics against currency debasement. Rising ETF holdings and institutional adoption strengthen Bitcoin’s store-of-value narrative similar to gold. Key Takeaways Macro support : Fiscal deficits and falling real rates underpin interest in hedges like BTC and gold. Institutional demand : ETF inflows and rising holdings signal growing professional adoption. Risk management : Expect volatility; use disciplined sizing and monitor macro updates. Conclusion The Bitcoin price outlook remains constructive despite short-term retracements.

52815786,https://cryptonews.com/?p=434289,1759876200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/52815786.jpeg,"Leading AI Claude Predicts the Price for XRP, Pepe and Pi Coin by the End of 2025",https://cryptonews.com/news/leading-ai-claude-predicts-the-price-for-xrp-pepe-and-pi-coin-by-the-end-of-2025/,"Claude AI, Anthropic’s counterpart to OpenAI’s ChatGPT, has issued a bullish forecast suggesting that XRP, Pepe, and Pi Network may all be positioning for unexpected new highs before the year is out. Bitcoin, the $2.5 trillion market heavyweight of the crypto sector, currently trades just 1% below its recent record of $126,080, set yesterday. Meanwhile, the rest of the digital asset market, now valued at $4.36 trillion, grew a modest 0.6% as several coins also clocked fresh new highs. Historically, October (aka “Uptober”) has been a strong month for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies overall, commonly serving as the launchpad for broader market rallies. New policy developments in the United States are helping cultivate the bullish sentiment. In July, President Trump enacted the GENIUS Act, America’s first federal law requiring full-reserve backing for stablecoins. Shortly afterward, the SEC unveiled its Project Crypto program, aimed at updating securities regulations for the digital asset era. With clearer rules emerging, the next altcoin cycle will surpass the unregulated frenzy of crypto’s historic 2021 bull run. If Claude’s analysis proves accurate, XRP, Pepe, and Pi Network may lead the next leg of the bull run. XRP (Ripple): Claude AI Projects EOY Price Range Comfortably Above $5 According to Claude AI’s latest projections, Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) could climb to as high as $6, which would represent an easy doubling from its current price near $2.98. XRP has already shown significant strength this year. After the SEC’s five-year lawsuit against Ripple concluded in Ripple’s favour, investors drove XRP’s price to $3.65 on July 18, its highest level since its 2018 peak of $3.40. Ripple continues to expand its payment network and drive institutional adoption across multiple markets. In 2024, the UN Capital Development Fund highlighted XRP as an efficient, low-cost remittance tool for developing nations. Ripple was also one of several crypto companies that appeared in the White House’s Digital Asset report. Claude AI suggests that if XRP can decisively break through its July high, it could achieve prices above $5 before year-end. However, many analysts, both human and machine, have higher targets, suggesting a run-up to $10 is not inconceivable with the right tailwinds. Over the past year, XRP has appreciated 456%, making it the top performer among the major unbacked cryptocurrencies. For comparison, Bitcoin rose 96%, while Ethereum added 92%. Technical charts show three bullish flag formations appearing throughout 2025, two of which formed during the summer, indicating strong breakout potential heading into the final quarter of the year. Although last month’s Federal Reserve rate cuts and the approval of the first spot XRP ETF didn’t immediately drive prices higher, analysts believe that Uptober’s seasonal momentum, additional US ETF greenlights this month, and new U.S. crypto legislation expected before year-end could act as powerful catalysts. Pepe ($PEPE): Meme Coin With 10× Upside Potential, According to Claude AI Launched in April 2023, Pepe ($PEPE) has rapidly become a top-three meme cryptocurrency, boasting a market cap of $4.2 billion, the largest among non-dog-themed meme tokens. Its unique cultural angle draws inspiration from Matt Furie’s Boy’s Club comics. Despite facing tough competition, Pepe’s robust liquidity and strong community support have helped sustain its popularity. Elon Musk has even referenced owning Pepe alongside Dogecoin on X, giving the token an additional visibility boost. Currently trading around $0.00001, Pepe has pulled back 64.5% from an ATH of $0.00002803, set on December 9, 2024, but continues to maintain critical support levels. A breakout above $0.000018 could clear the path towards $0.000023 by late November. Claude AI’s optimistic scenario envisions Pepe potentially topping at $0.000028, a near 3× gain from current levels. While Pepe’s already large valuation might limit growth, the token could still easily outperform Claude’s predictions in the next market surge. Pepe currently has a very neutral RSI of 50, which suggests it’s neither overbought nor oversold, giving it plenty of headroom to go either way. Should recent crypto market strength persist over the week, Pepe is more likely to enter the weekend above $0.000012. With improving regulatory clarity in the U.S., Pepe has the potential for even greater upside as investor confidence builds in the market as a whole, which is, of course, historically a big catalyst for meme coins. Pi Network ($PI): Claude AI Predicts Mobile Mining Innovator Could Hit $1 Pi Network ($PI) pioneered the “tap-to-mine” concept, enabling users to earn tokens directly from their smartphones by simply logging in daily and tapping the app. Now trading near $0.2623, Claude AI outlines a potential 4x surge to $1 before the year ends. It says in an ultra-bullish scenario, $PI could even hit $520, a 2000× gain from current prices. However, given the realities of its price performance over the year, this is extremely unlikely. However, the good news is that the project’s continuous ecosystem development and forthcoming milestones could support Claude’s sober bullish case. The team has been releasing steady updates, moving from version 19 to 23, with a mainnet debut on the immediate horizon, events that could serve as significant price drivers. Since its February 2025 debut, Pi has experienced heavy volatility, including a 171% jump in May. Its current RSI of around 31 indicates heavy selling and possible undervaluation. It also implies a rebound might be imminent, making this an attractive entry point for long-term believers. Retesting February’s high of $2.99 remains an ambitious goal but not an impossible one. Even if that level isn’t reached, crypto’s traditional October strength could lift Pi more than halfway towards the $1 mark by November, setting the stage for a festive-season rally. Maxi Doge (MAXI): High-Risk Meme Coin Fueled by Community Hype While Claude AI’s data-centric forecast focuses mainly on major altcoins, one new project gaining traction is Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , Dogecoin’s long-lost degen cousin. The team is marketing it with a pulse-pounding, gym-bro twist to appeal to speculative traders drawn to high-upside potential plays and community-driven excitement. Unlike Dogecoin, which has matured into a large-cap asset, Maxi Doge fully embraces its high-risk, high-reward ethos. Since launching only a couple of months ago, the project has raised more than $2.8 million. Built as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI promotes engagement through Telegram and Discord communities, competitive trading events, and upcoming brand collaborations. Of the total 150.24 billion tokens, 25% goes to the “Maxi Fund” for marketing and partnerships. Staking is already live, offering yields up to 121% APY, though this is variable, which means returns decrease as more stakers join the pool. Currently, presale tokens are $0.000261, with nominal increases every few days as the presale passes through its funding levels. Investors can participate through the Maxi Doge website using MetaMask or Best Wallet . Stay updated through Maxi Doge’s official X and Telegram pages.

These were its significant first movements since it clocked new high ATHs in August and July. Despite BTC commanding the spotlight, an increasing flow of strategic capital is moving toward altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which have already achieved fresh record levels this year. Washington is also preparing an accommodating regulatory landscape for crypto. First, President Trump’s GENIUS Act, the nation’s inaugural legislative framework recognizing and regulating stablecoins, has provided long-awaited clarity for both issuers and users. Soon after, the SEC introduced its Project Crypto initiative, representing a bold step toward modernizing securities laws for digital assets. Together, these developments signal a decisive leap forward for institutional participation in crypto markets. With confidence building, coins such as XRP, Plasma, and Bittensor are quickly emerging as standout contenders for traders hunting the next explosive move. Ripple ($XRP): Best Cross-Border Payment Crypto and Standout Altcoin of 2025 The core advantage of Ripple’s XRP ($XRP) lies in its fast, low-cost settlement system designed for international money transfers, posing a challenge to long-standing systems like SWIFT. It’s so good at what it does that the UN Capital Development Fund and the White House are watching. Ripple’s growing influence was further highlighted when CEO Brad Garlinghouse participated in a closed-door White House crypto policy roundtable earlier this year. The company’s rollout of RLUSD, a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin, emphasizes Ripple’s ambition to secure a major foothold in the rapidly expanding and vital stablecoin sector. Over the last year, XRP has surged 456%, rocketing to its first new peak in seven years, hitting $3.65 on July 18 before easing roughly 18% to around $2.99. Still, it has outperformed Bitcoin’s 96% gain over the same period by nearly fivefold. Currently, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovers around 53, reflecting gradually strengthening buying pressure as investors wait for a definitive bullish breakout signal. While catalysts like interest rate cuts and the approval of the first spot XRP ETF, both last month, did not spark an immediate rally (likely due to being priced in), traders remain optimistic. The formation of two bull flags over the summer hints at an upcoming breakout. With additional spot ETF decisions expected by the US SEC by mid-October, analysts project potential price targets between $5 and $10, with upside beyond that if momentum holds. Plasma ($XPL): Touting Itself as the Best Stablecoin Rails, This Crypto Could Blow Sky High Plasma (XPL) is a high-speed Layer 1 blockchain designed for fast, cost-free stablecoin payments, particularly with USDT. Its unique Paymaster system eliminates fees for basic transactions, making global transfers instant and affordable. The team essentially touts it as Money 2.0. If Bill Gates’s vision with Microsoft was simple: to put a computer in every home, then Plasma echoes that. They want everyone in the world, banked or otherwise, to have equal and permissionless access to the greenback in digital form. The XPL token secures the proof-of-stake network, supports staking, and will play a role in future governance. With a circulating supply of 1.8 billion tokens and a market cap of over $1.7 billion, XPL trades at roughly $0.99 and ranks among the top 100 cryptocurrencies. In the last 24 hours, Plasma blew up 13%, so now its RSI is downtrending from 51 as traders do a sport of recent profittaking. Considering the rest of the market is entering a bull cycle, this is not likely to bottom out very far, but should the selloff pickup pace, Plasma will quickly find support at $0.83. Ultimately, bull will be eyeing the $2 price target through Uptober. It’s possible, but substantial movements will likely be contingent on a positive news cycle for stablecoins. Additionally, they’re likely to find some resistance at $1.68, which is XPL’s ATH, set three days after launch. Bittensor ($TAO) Best Performing AI Crypto in Line for Further Substantial Gains Bittensor (TAO) is a crypto that merges blockchain with machine learning, enabling collaborative AI model training where participants earn rewards based on the value their contributions provide to the collective. This open-source protocol creates a permissionless marketplace for artificial intelligence, fostering innovation in a trustless environment. Fully compatible with Ethereum tools, Bittensor supports staking for network security and uses a proof-of-intelligence consensus to validate contributions. It also offers privacy-focused mechanisms for data handling. The TAO token has a circulating supply of about 10 million tokens and a market cap of over $3.3 billion, and currently trades at roughly $347 after rising 7% and posting the largest intraday gain among the top twenty AI coins . Any adverse market movements are likely to bottom out at $300, where TAO has solid psychological support. However, the appearance of a bullish flag across its support and resistance lines through August and September hints at the possibility of a strong end-of-year surge. Should that materialise, TAO could come close to challenging its ATH of $757.60 set in March last year. It would also result in the coin’s first substantial price peak in around a year. It last traded at $713 in December last year. TAO’s RSI is climbing up from 39 at a sharp angle. This means there could be more room for further gains by the weekend, but the token is fast approaching overbought and may dip to consolidate recent gains before next week.

BNB memecoins show high retail profitability Approximately 100,000 wallets engaged; 70% are profitable per on-chain data (Bubblemaps). Top performers PALU and 4 recorded market caps of roughly $90M and $239M and produced multiple million-dollar traders. BNB memecoins surge: PALU and 4 lead gains with 70% of traders profitable — explore on-chain data and expert insight on COINOTAG today. What is driving the BNB memecoin surge? BNB memecoins are surging because concentrated whale clustering, strong secondary-market liquidity and intense retail interest have combined to lift several tokens rapidly. Short-term momentum, social amplification and low entry costs created a rapid price cascade that produced outsized profits for many traders. How many traders are profiting and what does the data show? On-chain analytics provider Bubblemaps reports that over 100,000 traders have entered the BNB memecoin wave, with about 70% currently holding unrealized gains. The dataset also highlighted roughly 40 wallets with >$1 million gains and about 900 wallets with six-figure profits, underscoring concentrated but broad retail participation. Source: X (as reported in on-chain analytics commentary) Which tokens are leading the rally? Two BNB-chain memecoins stand out for market cap and trader participation: PALU and 4 . Clustered accumulation patterns and high secondary turnover drove rapid market-cap expansion and notable retail returns. Token Approx. Market Cap Notable on-chain metrics PALU $90 million ~40,000 interacting traders; ~70% profitable 4 $239 million Largest BNB memecoin by value; 21+ million-dollar winners; 6,000+ profitable wallets These metrics suggest coordinated accumulation among top wallets and strong retail momentum. Concentrated activity can amplify price moves but also increases vulnerability when liquidity tightens. How concentrated are the gains? Profit concentration is notable: a relatively small subset of wallets captured the largest windfalls, while a much broader retail base booked smaller but meaningful gains. This mix reflects both coordinated whale activity and active retail trading. Source: X (on-chain visuals and trader maps) How does BNB’s memecoin cycle compare to Solana’s earlier rally? BNB’s current memecoin surge resembles Solana’s previous memecoin mania in social intensity and rapid token creation. However, early indicators differ: BNB retail participants appear more frequently in profit, while Solana later saw a high attrition rate among projects and traders. Market analyst Luke Martin noted that Solana experienced hundreds of thousands of launches with a small survival rate, whereas BNB’s current wave so far produced a higher proportion of profitable outcomes. As he summarized: “Binance szn continues until this gap closes.” Source: X Frequently Asked Questions Are BNB memecoins a safe investment right now? Memecoin rallies are high-risk and highly volatile. While many BNB traders are currently profitable, sudden liquidity withdrawals and concentrated whale activity can reverse gains quickly. Treat positions as speculative and size risk accordingly. How can I verify on-chain trader profits? Use on-chain analytics tools (plain text mention: Bubblemaps) to inspect wallet interactions, profit/loss heatmaps and concentration metrics. Look for sustained secondary-market trading and liquidity depth before assuming durability. Will the BNB memecoin rally sustain long term? Historically, memecoin rallies tend to be short-lived unless supported by persistent liquidity and broader ecosystem adoption. Present data show strong short-term gains; long-term sustainability remains uncertain and depends on liquidity and market structure. Key Takeaways Retail profitability: ~70% of on-chain BNB memecoin traders are in profit, indicating broad short-term gains. Concentration risk: Major gains are concentrated among a subset of wallets, suggesting coordinated accumulation. Volatility warning: Rapid exits or liquidity drying can erase gains; monitor liquidity and on-chain metrics closely. Conclusion BNB memecoins, led by PALU and 4, have produced substantial short-term gains for many traders, backed by concentrated accumulation and vibrant secondary-market activity. BNB memecoins remain highly speculative; readers should combine on-chain data with risk management and continued monitoring.

The meeting, which had been billed as a chance to reset relations, ended with smiles, quotes for the cameras, and no relief from the tariffs choking Canadian industries. Trump called Carney “a world-class leader” and “a tough negotiator,” but the Canadian leader went home empty-handed. Trump said, “We’ve come a long way over the last few months, actually, in terms of that relationship. I think they’re going to walk away very happy.” Carney, who praised Trump’s role in foreign policy during the meeting, heard the president respond, “We have great love for each other. We have a natural conflict.” The exchange summed up the odd balance of flattery and tension that has defined their dealings since Trump returned to the White House. Trump cracks jokes while Canada fails to get tariff relief Reporters pressed Trump on why Canada still had no deal while the European Union had already reached an agreement. Trump deflected, saying, “Because I want to be a great man, too,” drawing laughter in the room. The comments were lighthearted, but they left the fundamental question unanswered. Carney risked political backlash at home by attending without winning any concessions, as the tariffs remain on Canadian steel, aluminum, autos, copper, and softwood lumber. Canada’s 25 percent countertariffs on U.S. steel and aluminum are also still in place. The White House reception matched what Carney’s office had predicted in advance: a session designed to create progress rather than close an agreement. But the domestic cost is rising. Carney won the April election on promises to face down Trump and protect Canada’s economy from the tariff fight. Months later, Canada is still the only member of the G7 that hasn’t secured a deal to ease the duties. Ontario Premier Doug Ford told reporters in Toronto, “We need to hit back hard. You sure don’t sit back and get beat up by a bully every single day. It’s like a kid going in the school yard and getting punched in the face every day.” Ford added, “Maybe Prime Minister Carney knows something I don’t know. And if that’s the case, he should sit down with the premiers and explain that.” Canada’s United Steelworkers union director Marty Warren issued his own warning, saying, “We need urgent action — not more concessions. Canada’s softwood lumber industry is on the brink of collapse.” Carney turns to USMCA review while Trump revives old lines Carney has shifted some focus toward the 2026 mandatory review of the United States‑Mexico‑Canada Agreement. About 85 percent of Canadian exports are tariff‑exempt under the current arrangement, giving him another path to press his case. Trump indicated he may consider a bilateral arrangement with Canada, saying, “We’re allowed to do different deals if we want. I want to make whatever the best deal is for this country, and also very much with Canada in mind.” Despite months of friendlier exchanges, Trump has not abandoned his jabs. Just last week, he again called Canada the “51st state” while speaking to U.S. generals. And when Carney tried to praise Trump’s efforts in foreign conflicts, including India and Pakistan, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and Gaza, Trump interrupted him with, “The merger of Canada and the United States?” Carney shot back, “No! That wasn’t where I was going,” before laughing off the moment. It was not the first time they had confronted the subject. Back in May, during their first Oval Office meeting, Carney told Trump bluntly, “Canada is not for sale. Won’t be for sale, ever.” Trump responded, “Never say never,” but let it slide. Carney has managed to avoid the outbursts that marked Justin Trudeau’s clashes with Trump during the last administration. Trudeau had called the tariffs “very dumb” and accused Trump of siding with Vladimir Putin. Carney, by contrast, has kept steady contact through calls and text messages, keeping tensions from boiling over. Still, with tariffs biting and no breakthrough in Washington, the relationship looks weaker than ever. Trump closed the meeting by predicting, “I think the people of Canada, they will love us again.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

With $12.5 trillion in assets under management, the world’s biggest money manager is going hard on Bitcoin, AI, and European corporate credit. They’re pushing deep into sectors that others are still figuring out, locking down infrastructure, loading up on energy, and snapping up the kind of private assets that come with sky-high fees and low public oversight. At the center of this aggressive push is a deal by Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), BlackRock’s recently acquired infrastructure arm, to buy Aligned Data Centers. This would rank as one of the largest data infrastructure buys of the year. GIP is also pushing to finalize the acquisition of Allete Inc., a utility firm based in Minnesota.Regulators are close to approving the deal, which would give BlackRock a direct connection to energy that can feed the growing data center demand. On top of that, they’ve been holding talks with AES Corp., a renewable power and utility giant with a $38 billion valuation. If that deal closes, it would become one of the largest utility takeovers ever recorded. BlackRock pours billions into AI power and crypto ETFs The timing isn’t random. AI needs insane levels of compute, and that compute runs on energy. BlackRock saw the writing on the wall when it shelled out $12.5 billion to buy GIP last year. CEO Larry Fink called it the start of a “golden age” for infrastructure. He wasn’t joking. This year, GIP joined forces with Microsoft, MGX, and later Nvidia and xAI, to raise $30 billion for AI and energy infrastructure. With leverage, they expect that pool to support $100 billion worth of projects. But AI isn’t the only game BlackRock is cornering. The firm’s Bitcoin ETF, known as IBIT, is about to smash the $100 billion asset mark. The fund, launched less than two years ago, charges a 0.25% fee and is already raking in over $240 million annually. Analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart from Bloomberg Intelligence say it’s the most profitable ETF in BlackRock’s entire lineup, and that’s out of more than 1,000 funds. What’s crazy is how fast it got there. IBIT is on track to hit $100 billion five times faster than any ETF in history. It’s now shorthand for the entire crypto ETF category, pulling in both retail and institutional flows like a vacuum. Private assets now make up only 5% of BlackRock’s total book, around $600 billion. But those assets bring in higher fees and are exactly what large strategic clients are after. Buying Aligned is a clear signal: BlackRock isn’t messing around with AI or data infrastructure. They want full ownership, control, and return. BlackRock shifts focus to European bonds and trims projections While crypto and AI dominate headlines, BlackRock is betting hard on European credit. In their latest fixed income report, they called European corporate bonds one of the “most compelling” options for global investors. With yields close to 3%, the firm sees them as one of the few places left offering steady income without taking major risk. “Companies still look in quite good shape overall,” said James Turner, co-head of global fixed income in EMEA. “There’s not many opportunities to find relatively safe yield at the moment.” Inflation forecasts are aligned with the ECB’s 2% target, growth is trending up, and credit markets continue pulling in capital. BlackRock favors banks, utilities, tech, media, and telecoms; sectors they say are shielded from tariffs. But not everything is pointing up. BofA Securities just dropped its price target for BlackRock stock (BLK) from $1,396 to $1,394, even though they kept their Buy rating. The company’s market cap sits at $182.6 billion. The stock is up 45.7% in the last six months, now hovering near its 52-week high of $1,184.12. Still, InvestingPro says it looks overvalued, with earnings expectations having been revised down across multiple periods. For Q3 2025, EPS was slashed from $12.41 to $11.17. Full-year 2025 projections fell to $47.38 from $48.59. Even with 15.45% revenue growth and a P/E ratio of 28.45x, analysts are starting to question the stock’s current price.

Bitcoin was trading near a fresh high at the time, which helped the comment spread quickly. Context Around The Claim Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $126,080 on Oct 7, 2025. At the same time, data cited by several outlets put global Bitcoin fund assets under management at about $200 billion. Those two figures were used by many market watchers to give the $1 trillion remark context: higher prices + rising fund flows = a much larger market for managed Bitcoin products. $1 trillion inbound…. https://t.co/6qTb3cOqg9 — Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) October 6, 2025 Hougan’s post was not a detailed forecast. It was short and informal. According to coverage, many crypto sites simply reposted the message and tied it to recent ETF inflows and renewed institutional interest. The post did not include a timetable or the assumptions required to get from roughly $200 billion to $1 trillion, and the lack of detail left room for analysts to disagree. Market Reactions And Caution Several mainstream outlets treated the remark as bullish but urged caution. Reuters and other outlets pointed out that institutional adoption is still limited when compared to traditional asset classes. According to some analysts, getting to $1 trillion in Bitcoin fund AUM would mean a big, sustained shift by large investors such as pension plans and big wealth managers, not only short-term retail buying or a single strong month of inflows. Simple Math, Big Gaps If global fund AUM is about $200 billion now, reaching $1 trillion would mean a growth of five times that level. That implies adding roughly $800 billion in assets to crypto funds. Those are not small sums. They would require consistent flows over many months or years, plus choices by big institutions to allocate meaningful portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin. Related Reading: 2%–4% In Crypto? Morgan Stanley Thinks That’s The Smart Move Now What Needs To Happen Analysts say several things would have to happen for that scenario to play out. Based on reports, regulators would need to stay predictable, more large money managers would have to offer and scale Bitcoin products, and major institutional investors would have to shift part of their capital toward these funds. Hougan’s short message has, at minimum, renewed a public conversation about how big Bitcoin investment products might become.

With the company’s national bank charter decision expected soon, the timing of this reveal is drawing more attention. Ripple Executives Sign OCC Certification In June 2025 According to Xaif Crypto, the document shared on X shows an official OCC certification signed by Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, and Timothy Keaney, dated June 30, 2025. The accreditation confirms that Ripple applied in accordance with U.S. federal banking regulations, a step required for forming a new financial institution. The document clearly states that all information provided in the filing was scrutinized, complete, and accurate as of the date of submission. The OCC certification document includes a declaration acknowledging that the OCC, the U.S. federal banking regulator, is responsible for approving the application. By signing the certification, Ripple’s top executives demonstrated the company’s clear intention to operate in accordance with U.S. banking laws and gain formal recognition as a trusted financial institution. XRP Community Reacts As National Bank Charter Decision Nears After Xaif Crypto shared the signed OCC document on X, the XRP community quickly began reacting. The post, which reads, “Docs signed by Stuart Alderoty & Timothy Keaney (June 30, 2025), Now all eyes on October,” is drawing strong attention and excitement, as Ripple’s national bank charter decision is pending this month. The timing of the OCC certification signed by Ripple executives has generated even more excitement across the crypto community, as many now believe U.S. regulators could soon recognize the crypto firm as a regulated financial institution. Ripple’s move toward regulatory certification from the OCC advances the fintech company’s plan to integrate XRP with traditional finance and gain recognition in the global market. By following this regulatory route, the fintech company could strengthen relationships with banks, payment firms, and large investors. This momentum could in turn increase market confidence in XRP and support the broader adoption of the digital asset in global markets. Ripple is steadily solidifying XRP’s place as a bridge currency between blockchain innovation and traditional finance . The OCC document shows Ripple’s growing commitment to meeting U.S. banking standards, hinting that the company may be preparing to launch an “XRP Bank” as early as October. As the October decision approaches, the crypto world is closely watching the OCC’s decision. Whether the OCC approves or not, the appearance of the signed certification has already made clear that Ripple is serious about its role in the U.S. financial system. For now, all eyes remain on what happens next as the company waits for the final charter decision this month.",Ripple|ripple|ripple news|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|FIAT|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-07 23:00:22

Some alts have enjoyed double-digit percentage gains within the last seven days, while the market as a whole has a reached a record total capitalization of $4.36 trillion. This is a reflection of rising institutional interest in crypto, and with a large number of altcoin ETFs set to launch by the end of the year, we could see even more big rallies very soon. It’s in this context that we provide a crypto price prediction for XRP, Solana and Shiba Inu, examining their technicals and fundamentals to predict where they could be by January. Crypto Price Prediction: XRP ($XRP) – Oversold Technicals and Incoming ETFs Are Recipe for Big Rally XRP has dipped a little today, although its drop to $2.97 also marks a 4% gain in a week and a 5% gain in a month. What’s bullish about XRP right now is that it has been in a fairly oversold position for too long now, and should really rebound strongly, especially given its fundamentals. As we see with its chart below, its relative strength index (yellow) has been seesawing around the 50 level since late July. Source: TradingView Its price has also been trading within a pennant, which appears to be converging towards a point where XRP should make a big move. And given that more than ten XRP ETFs are likely to launch in the next few weeks, this big move could be very positive. It could hit $3.50 by the end of the month, before climbing above $10 by the end of the year . Crypto Price Prediction: Solana ($SOL) – Altcoin Ready for New ATHs as ETFs Prepare to Launch Solana has dropped by 1% in the past 24 hours, yet its current price of $230 puts it up by 10% in a week and by 13% in a month. And SOL is in a great position to post more gains on top of these, especially when it’s also looking forward to the launch of several Solana ETFs. Bloomberg analysts have given these ETFs a ‘100%’ chance of approval , largely because the SEC has updated its policy on how to process crypto ETF applications. The coin’s chart also suggests that it’s close to exploding, with its two main indicators – the RSI and MACD (orange, blue) – rising up from oversold positions. Source: TradingView In view of these factors, and in view of Solana’s dominant position as a layer-one network , the crypto price prediction for SOL is very good. It could reach $300 at some point in November, before ending 2025 close to $500. Crypto Price Prediction: Shiba Inu ($SHIB) – Meme Token Poised to Outperform Market This Winter At $0.00001267, SHIB has risen by 8% in a week and by 2% in a month, whereas it remains down by 31% in the past year. This is a disappointing percentage, but it suggests that SHIB could rise quickly as and when a market-wide end-of-year rally gets into full swing. Indeed, SHIB is down by 85% in relation to its 2021 ATH of $0.00008616, meaning that it has plenty of catching up to do. Its chart shows that it has begun to recover from an undervalued position, with its RSI and MACD both rising again after being in negative territory. Source: TradingView This suggests that SHIB’s low price is beginning to entice buyers again, although its volume remains modest at $220 million today. Its price is likely to rise in parallel with the market, with an end-of-year bull rally helping to push it back towards $0.000030 in November, and then towards $0.000050 by January. $1.7 Million Raised in Presale: Is PEPENODE Going to Be the Big New Meme Coin of 2026? The coins above have good prospects in the short- and long-term, yet many investors would also do well to consider diversifying their portfolios into small-cap tokens as well. Such tokens can post disproportionate, exponential gains, seeing as how they start from low levels and can rise quickly once they gain new listings. One token hoping to do this soon is PEPENODE ($PEPENODE), a new ERC-20 cryptocurrency that recently launched its presale. Building a Server Room AND Virtual Mining?! Yes Please. Let the $PEPENODE flow https://t.co/FaKIaBpf4I pic.twitter.com/jN00FsQ3UQ — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) October 7, 2025 It has now raised $1.7 million in its sale, which is attracting more investors with each passing week. PEPENODE has been intriguing investors because of its claim to be the market’s first mine-to-earn token. What this means is that users will have the ability to earn rewards by building their own virtual mining rigs. They can add virtual nodes to their rigs by buying them with PEPENODE, something which could drive demand for the new token. And the more nodes a user has, the more they’ll earn in rewards, which PEPENODE will pay out in third-party tokens, such as Fartcoin and Pepe. Holders will also be able to stake PEPENODE, making it a potentially very lucrative token. Its sale will end a little later in the year, but investors can join now by heading over to the PEPENODE website . It’s currently selling for $0.0010918, a price that will continue to rise until the sale closes. Buy PEPENODE Here.

With Bitcoin holding steady and DeFi projects reviving momentum, investors are hunting for the next breakout. If you’re asking: “Which token could let me turn $500 into $50,000 this quarter?”. You’ll want to balance safety, growth potential, and smash-through narratives. In that case, a new DeFi project is attracting whale attention due to its real-world utility. Cardano Price: Can ADA Still Be the Play? Cardano remains a key player among layer-1 projects. The Cardano price prediction reports are split. Some see ADA revisiting $1.50, while others warn of possible dips. ADA is stuck below key resistance near $0.85, with analysts saying a breakout could send it toward $1.50. But others caution that if it fails, it may slip toward $0.70. In recent forecasts, Cardano is projected to average around $0.95. Early buyers of ADA in past cycles are already up big but scaling a $500 position into $50,000 in one quarter using ADA alone demands a 100× move. That’s unlikely for a large, fairly liquid token like ADA unless there’s a shock catalyst. Still, ADA’s stability and adoption make it a contender if markets tip toward risk assets again. Remittix (RTX): The Breakout Bet You Can’t Ignore Remittix is emerging not just as “another altcoin,” but as a real use-case powerhouse with momentum that’s hard to ignore. It is positioning itself as a cross-chain PayFi platform built to bridge crypto and fiat flows. If Cardano gives you stability, Remittix gives you explosive upside. Remittix isn’t just hype , it’s backing that up with utility, momentum, and verified credentials. If current trajectories hold, early RTX buyers could see returns that dwarf what ADA or XRP might deliver this quarter. Why Remittix Might Outpace the Pack ● Global Reach to Banks: Users can send crypto to traditional bank accounts in 30+ countries directly.● Real-World Utility: Not just speculation; built for payments, borderless flows, and everyday use.● Security First: Fully audited and CertiK-verified, ranked #1 among prelaunch tokens.● Wallet Launch & FX Power: The mobile wallet is on track, with real-time FX conversion built in.● Impressive Fundraising: Over $27.1 million raised, and already 675 million+ RTX sold in the presale. Compared with ADA or even mature altcoins, Remittix offers a leap: a smaller token with room to burst, a community that’s growing fast, and a roadmap tied to real payments. Early holders may reap outsized gains if the platform captures adoption. Remittix $250,000 Giveaway & Referral Blitz Remittix just kicked off a $250,000 giveaway to reward early supporters. But that’s not all — they launched a new referral program that lets every user earn 15% of any new buyer’s purchase in USDT, claimable every 24 hours through their dashboard. What does that mean for you? Your investment doesn’t just sit — it works. You refer your network, you earn. This could turn referrals into a serious side income in days. The presale has already soared past $27.1 million raised, and 675 million RTX tokens sold so far. Over 25,000 holders have joined, and the Gleam page for the giveaway is flooded with 300,000+ entries. Exchanges like BitMart and LBank are first up in confirming listing plans — momentum is building fast.

These metrics, alongside a recovering NVT Golden Cross and positive funding rates, indicate measured, institution-led demand driving upside momentum. Institutions continue to accumulate on spot markets, shown by a sustained Coinbase Premium. Spot Taker CVD and Funding Rates point to buyer dominance and controlled optimism among leveraged traders. NVT Golden Cross recovery (+38%) signals valuation aligning with rising on‑chain activity. Bitcoin institutional inflows lead market strength — read the latest data-driven analysis and what investors should watch next. What are the latest signs that institutional inflows are driving Bitcoin? Bitcoin institutional inflows are evident from a persistently positive Coinbase Premium Index and taker-buy dominance in spot markets. These indicators show sustained accumulation by professional investors, supporting a bullish structure where spot demand underpins price action rather than short-lived leverage-driven rallies. How does the Coinbase Premium Index confirm accumulation? The Coinbase Premium Index staying positive means more buying pressure on Coinbase Pro versus other venues. This pattern typically reflects larger, U.S.-based institutional orders and suggests that deep-pocketed participants are steadily building positions during consolidation phases. How are buyers controlling market momentum? The 90-day Spot Taker CVD has been taker-buy dominant, indicating aggressive buys that lift offers and absorb sell-side liquidity. This behavior demonstrates persistent demand absorption and confidence in price continuation. Spot-driven accumulation reduces reliance on leveraged speculation and points to a structural buyer base that can sustain rallies with lower volatility risk. Source: CryptoQuant (plain text) What does the NVT Golden Cross recovery mean for Bitcoin’s fundamentals? The NVT Golden Cross recovering ~38% shows improving alignment between Bitcoin’s market cap and transaction activity. A rising NVT Golden Cross implies that price moves are increasingly supported by on‑chain usage rather than speculative flows. This trend historically correlates with higher-quality appreciation and suggests a shift toward sustainable growth momentum. Source: CryptoQuant (plain text) Why do positive funding rates matter now? Moderately positive Funding Rates (averaging ~0.01% on major venues) show that longs slightly dominate derivatives positioning. This level of positivity indicates confidence among leveraged traders without excessive crowding, which reduces tail-risk from forced deleveraging events. Combined with spot accumulation, positive funding suggests the market is structurally constructive rather than overheated. Source: Santiment (plain text) Are institutions setting the tone for Bitcoin’s next rally? The alignment of institutional accumulation, taker-buy dominance in spot, a recovering NVT Golden Cross, and balanced positive funding rates forms a coherent bullish narrative. These signals together increase the probability that any next leg up will be supported by active demand rather than speculative excess. Institutional conviction appears to be the stabilizing factor that could attract incremental retail participation over time. Frequently Asked Questions How can investors track institutional accumulation? Investors can monitor the Coinbase Premium Index, Spot Taker CVD, and on‑chain NVT metrics. Consistently positive premium and taker-buy dominance indicate ongoing institutional accumulation and stronger market structure. Does a positive funding rate always mean a rally is imminent? No. A modestly positive funding rate shows long-side preference but must be interpreted with spot and on‑chain data; when combined with spot accumulation and improved NVT, it adds conviction for sustained upside. What should traders watch next? Watch changes in Coinbase Premium, Spot Taker CVD momentum, NVT trajectory, and funding-rate spikes. Divergences between these indicators and price action can signal shifts in market risk or reduced institutional demand. Key Takeaways Institutional accumulation is persistent : Coinbase Premium and taker-buy CVD show steady buying by professional investors. Fundamentals are improving : A ~38% NVT Golden Cross recovery points to valuation aligning with on‑chain activity. Balanced bullishness : Positive but modest funding rates suggest controlled leverage and lower blow-off risk; monitor these metrics for continued alignment. Conclusion Data-driven indicators — including the Coinbase Premium Index , 90-day Spot Taker CVD, NVT Golden Cross recovery, and steady funding rates — collectively point to institution-led strength in Bitcoin. Continued alignment of spot accumulation and on‑chain fundamentals would support a sustainable upward trajectory; investors should monitor these signals for confirmation. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/bitcoin-institutional-inflows-analysis-2025-10-07"" }, ""headline"": ""Institutional Inflows and Buyer Dominance Support Bitcoin’s Bullish Structure"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bitcoin-Spot-Taker-CVDCumulative-Volume-Delta-90-day-7.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-07T10:23:35Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T10:23:35Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Institutional inflows tracked by Coinbase Premium and spot taker CVD support Bitcoin’s bullish structure; NVT recovery and positive funding rates add conviction.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How do institutional inflows show up in market data?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Institutional inflows appear as a sustained positive Coinbase Premium, taker-buy dominant Spot CVD, and steady accumulation on large spot venues, indicating professional demand."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What does a recovering NVT Golden Cross indicate?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""A recovering NVT Golden Cross suggests valuation is aligning with rising on-chain transaction activity, implying more fundamental support for price moves."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How to interpret Bitcoin market signals for institutional accumulation"", ""description"": ""A short guide to reading Coinbase Premium, Spot Taker CVD, NVT Golden Cross, and funding rates to assess institutional demand."", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 1, ""name"": ""Check Coinbase Premium"", ""text"": ""Confirm whether the Coinbase Premium Index is persistently positive to detect U.S. spot accumulation."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 2, ""name"": ""Review Spot Taker CVD"", ""text"": ""Assess the 90-day Spot Taker CVD for taker-buy dominance, which signals aggressive buying and liquidity absorption."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""position"": 3, ""name"": ""Analyze NVT and Funding"", ""text"": ""Combine NVT Golden Cross trends with Funding Rates to judge whether price moves are fundamental or leverage-driven."" } ]} Published: 2025-10-07 | Updated: 2025-10-07 | Author: COINOTAG",Bitcoin|News|BTC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-07 23:11:41

Grayscale launches staking for its Ethereum ETFs with 32,000 ETH staked as ETH price climbs above $4,700. What is Grayscale staking for its Ethereum ETFs? Grayscale staking for its Ethereum ETFs is a program that enabled Grayscale’s ETHE and ETH funds to stake pooled ETH on the Ethereum proof-of-stake network, earning protocol staking rewards. Both funds staked a combined 32,000 ETH (~$150 million) on launch day, aiming to enhance fund returns for investors. How does Grayscale distribute staking rewards for ETHE and ETH? Grayscale uses a dual reward strategy. ETHE will pay staking rewards as periodic cash distributions to shareholders. ETH will retain staking rewards within the fund, increasing net asset value over time. Arkham Intelligence provided the initial staking tally of 32,000 ETH as the on-chain reference.

Staking can increase ETF performance by adding protocol rewards to returns. ETHE distributes rewards as cash, which benefits income-focused investors, while ETH compounds returns by reinvesting rewards into NAV. Is staking secure for institutional investors? Security depends on custody arrangements and validator selection. Institutional-grade custody and transparent validator processes reduce operational risk.

The Russian media outlet RBC reported that the facility operators used power grid know-how to manipulate meter data. Russian law enforcement officers break into a container housing hundreds of crypto mining rigs during a raid. (Source: Ministry of Interior/Telegram) 2,700 Crypto Mining Rigs Confiscated Irina Volk, a spokesperson for the Russian Interior Ministry, explained that “over seven years ago,” three unnamed St. Petersburg residents “signed a contract to connect a commercial property to the power grid.” However, earlier this year, energy grid investigators began to suspect something was amiss with the property’s power consumption. They followed up with a probe, which revealed a discrepancy between meter readings at the facility and actual usage figures. The Interior Ministry and police joined the investigation, eventually raiding the facility. Volk released a video on the ministry’s Telegram channel, showing officers conducting the raid. The video shows officers forcing a man to the floor inside a building. Other officers then force open a locked shipping container with a crowbar. Inside, the container appears to be housing thousands of operational crypto mining rigs. Officers said they found several of these containers at the site. Fans and other cooling equipment also appear to be functioning inside the container. Officers then force open the door to another building, which also houses banks of hundreds of rigs. Russian law enforcement officers find thousands of crypto mining rigs during a raid. (Source: Ministry of Interior/Telegram) Officers Confiscate Transformers and Cooling Equipment Volk said ministry officials believe that the suspects used advanced electrical knowledge to manipulate the meter. The meter then provided low readings to the power provider, allowing the suspects to pay for a tiny fraction of the power they had consumed. The crypto mining “farm” operated unhindered between March 2018 and August 2025, the spokesperson confirmed. Officers said they confiscated all of the mining rigs, in addition to two transformers and cooling equipment.

The ministry did not reveal how much electricity they believe the suspects had stolen from the grid, nor its monetary worth or the type of coins the trio mined. However, illegal crypto mining appears to be on the rise in Russia and Russia-controlled territories. In mid-September, Russian police unearthed a small network of illegal mining centers in what Moscow calls the Donetsk People’s Republic.

The network’s operators caused damages worth 14 million rubles ($170,633), officials said. Illegal crypto mining is particularly rife in traditional Russian Bitcoin mining hotspots like the North Caucasus and Southern Siberia. Last year, power providers in Dagestan announced they had discovered subterranean crypto mining centers, apparently built to avoid detection from energy officials . Some illegal miners have also begun using mobile units housed in large trucks and vans to help them relocate if they learn that energy companies have become aware of their activities.

According to Karoline, the president plan to redirect millions of dollars collected through tariffs to temporarily fund the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, better known as WIC, before it collapses from a lack of federal money. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that “the Trump White House will not allow impoverished mothers and their babies to go hungry because of the Democrats’ political games.” WIC, which helps families buy formula, fruits, vegetables, baby food, yogurt, bread, cheese, and more, was expected to run out of money this week. In past shutdowns, the program leaned on emergency reserves to stay afloat, but this time around, things are far more fragile. Some states had already started planning to use their own funds to cover the program temporarily, with the hope of getting reimbursed later once Congress gets its act together. States face delays as White House rushes to plug the gap Now WIC supports around 7 million people across the country, though only half of those who qualify are actually enrolled. And while the program has enjoyed strong bipartisan support since it was created, cracks have started to show. The White House’s 2026 budget plan includes cuts to the popular fruit and vegetable benefits, and House Republicans’ agriculture bill has floated similar reductions. Even as Trump moves to hold the line with tariff cash, Georgia Machell, who heads the National WIC Association, said the situation is full of holes. “Families need long-term stability, not short-term uncertainty. We still don’t know how much funding this measure provides, how quickly states will receive it, or how long it will sustain operations,” Georgia said in a public statement on Tuesday. Some states were already preparing for the worst before the Trump announcement. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) had informed them last week that they wouldn’t receive their regular quarterly allocation of WIC funds for fiscal year 2026. In the meantime, the USDA said it could release up to $150 million in contingency funds to states with critical shortfalls, and told states to also use infant formula rebates or local dollars to fill any gaps. Critics question legality of tariff plan But not everyone is sold on the legality of Trump’s plans. Chris Towner, a budget policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told CNN that:- “The problem isn’t that they don’t have the money, it’s that Congress hasn’t told them they can spend it.” That comment raises bigger questions about whether the administration can keep WIC running on tariff funds alone without breaking spending laws. Meanwhile, more families are joining WIC every year as states and the federal government have made it easier to enroll and recertify, and improved the overall shopping experience. On top of that, inflation, especially around food prices, has been crushing low-income households. Surging costs of groceries and other essentials have pushed more American families to depend on government aid like WIC just to survive, but that .

Although known for his support of Ethereum, Leshka has recently turned his analytical focus toward XRP, presenting an unexpected yet confident prediction about its short-term potential. According to Leshka, XRP could rise to as high as $8.5 before the end of Q4 2025. His assessment arrives at a time when XRP continues to lag behind other leading digital assets, struggling to sustain momentum despite a modest recovery across the broader crypto market. XRP’s Current Market Position At the time of analysis, XRP is trading around $2.89 , reflecting a modest 1.9% increase over the past week. However, data shows that XRP remains one of the weakest performers among the top ten cryptocurrencies. In comparison, Bitcoin (BTC) has climbed 7.69% in the same period, while Ethereum (ETH) has seen an even stronger 10% rise. The underwhelming performance of XRP is largely attributed to selling pressure near the $3 psychological resistance level, which has repeatedly limited its upward movement. Despite this, Leshka maintains a positive outlook, asserting that XRP has the potential to deliver outsized gains by year-end. $XRP just broke out of 6-month triangle exactly like 2017 same pattern, same RSI sequence, same setup 2017 gave us 20x to $3.33 2025 targeting $8.50 by EOY the fractal is identical history doesn't repeat but it rhymes $XRP army is about to leave the cuck chair and join the… https://t.co/lsod6KZ2P5 pic.twitter.com/1JVcXJdkt5 — Leshka.eth (@leshka_eth) July 27, 2025 Leshka’s Q4 2025 Forecast for XRP The analyst predicts that XRP will trade within a range of $8 to $9 in the fourth quarter of 2025. From current levels, this target represents an increase of approximately 176% to 211%. His projection is based on technical analysis that compares XRP’s present price action to historical patterns observed in previous market cycles. Leshka previously highlighted that XRP had completed a breakout from a six-month consolidation structure similar to the one preceding its 2017 bull run . During that period, XRP surged twentyfold, peaking at around $3.30. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Drawing parallels between the two market conditions, he believes XRP is following a comparable trajectory, only this time, with a higher potential ceiling. Based on these similarities, Leshka anticipates that XRP could approach $8.5 by the end of 2025, which closely aligns with his latest $8–$9 estimate. Comparative Forecasts for Bitcoin and Ethereum Beyond XRP, Leshka has also provided projections for other major cryptocurrencies. He expects Bitcoin to trade between $225,000 and $240,000 by the close of 2025. From its current price of $122,177, this range implies potential growth of 84% to 96%. For Ethereum, Leshka anticipates a price range of $11,000 to $13,000, up from its current level of $4,506. This projection translates to a potential gain 144% to 189%, indicating that the analyst maintains strong confidence in Ethereum’s performance. However, his forecast also suggests that XRP could outperform both Bitcoin and Ethereum in percentage growth terms within the same period. Leshka’s projections reflect a bullish stance on XRP despite its current struggles with market resistance and underperformance relative to peers. His analysis, rooted in historical price structures and technical patterns, envisions substantial upward potential by the end of 2025. If the forecast materializes, XRP could not only recover from its present stagnation but also become one of the strongest performers among major digital assets in the coming months.

The meme coin has outperformed XRP over the past week, gaining 12% and surpassing $4 billion in 24-hour trading volume. Yet, both altcoins find themselves similarly positioned, with several issuers facing their final spot ETF decision deadline on October 17. XRP and Dogecoin ETF decision deadlines. As qualifying assets under the SEC generic listing standards, they land on the fast track for approval, making S-1 filings the last barrier for a green light. But with markets anticipating another 50 bps in U.S. interest rate cuts before year-end, the macro backdrop continues to drive capital rotation into higher-risk assets like meme coins. Dogecoin Price Analysis: This Could be the Start of $1 DOGE These stacking catalysts for demand position DOGE to realise a cup-and-handle pattern forming since the start of the year. Dogecoin now approaches the neckline at $0.29, the key threshold for a breakout, with momentum indicators firmly bullish. DOGE / USD 1-day chart, 10-month cup-and-handle pattern nears breakout. Source: TradingView. The RSI has established a strong footing above the neutral line, suggesting buyers are maintaining control of the current move. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram continues to widen its gap above the signal line, reinforcing the view that the uptrend has staying power. A successful flip of the neckline to support would confirm the breakout, eyeing a retest of all-time highs at $0.49 and a potential 150% move $0.65. And as the bull market matures, continued rate cuts and deeper TradFi exposure via ETFs, corporate treasuries, and even potential 401(k) inclusion could drive DOGE further. The $1 milestone could be in focus , making for a 285% gain.

That surge came right after the company locked in a major deal with OpenAI, the same day Jefferies slapped a massive upgrade on the stock. The brokerage firm hiked AMD’s price target from $170 to $300, a bold 82% increase, and moved the rating from “hold” to “buy.” That $300 call represents almost a 50% jump from where AMD closed on Monday, which was $203.71. The Jefferies call wasn’t just some surface-level optimism. Analysts there laid out an even bigger upside case, $400 per share, if the AI server market goes even faster and AMD eats more of Nvidia’s lunch. If that scenario plays out, AMD shares would nearly double from where they’re sitting now. The stock’s Monday surge alone dragged the Nasdaq Composite to a new all-time high. AMD soared, and in a twist, Nvidia dropped. That role reversal didn’t go unnoticed on the street. OpenAI takes 10% stake as AMD commits massive GPU power The big trigger behind this price explosion is AMD’s newly announced deal with OpenAI. The company behind ChatGPT is giving AMD a vote of confidence, and up to a 10% stake, in exchange for years’ worth of GPU rollout. The plan is to deploy 6 gigawatts of AMD Instinct GPUs over several years, which is a serious buildout (measured in gigawatts, not just chips), proving just how massive the AI infrastructure race has become. Blayne Curtis, analyst at Jefferies, called it a “multi-generational opportunity” in a note to clients Monday night. He admitted the upgrade wasn’t even on the table before the announcement, but the deal “forced his hand.” His note said, “AMD will still have to hit milestones, but this is a strong validation of AMD’s AI roadmap and the level of AI demand in general.” Blayne added that OpenAI has already been “on a spending spree,” cutting non-binding deals with Nvidia, Oracle, and Samsung/Hynix, all pointing to a massive land grab for compute capacity and energy-hungry data centers. The agreement isn’t signed in blood, but the size and ambition show that OpenAI sees this as a long-haul investment in compute. And if the numbers hold up, AMD may find itself stealing even more share from Nvidia, especially as AI players look to diversify supplier exposure amid surging demand. Investors split on AI profits while bubble fears grow On CNBC’s “Halftime Report” Tuesday, Josh Brown from Ritholtz Wealth Management said he’s not blind to the bubble, but said people need to get over the idea that everything is hype. “Of course, there’s a bubble,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean there aren’t real projects that are going to have world-transforming outcomes.” He warned against throwing all AI bets into the “speculative” bucket, saying investors should still take some of them seriously. At the same time, Brown didn’t deny things are getting frothy. “Anytime you have an environment where there’s this much enthusiasm for a new technology, and there are literally trillions of dollars being spent, not all of that spending is going to have a nice ROI at the end of the rainbow,” he said. Tuesday’s broader market action reflected some of that tension. The Nasdaq Composite closed down 0.7%, even though it had just touched a fresh high the day before. Oracle led a wave of pullbacks in other AI-related names, like Nvidia, Western Digital, and SanDisk. That move came after The Information reported that Oracle’s cloud business saw slimmer-than-expected profit margins on Nvidia sales for the quarter ending in August. That triggered fresh fears that while AI stocks might look unstoppable on the surface, revenue might not keep up. Brown added that when this bubble finally gives, it might just be a fizzle, not a crash. “Most of the time, you’ll just see certain names blow up, you’ll see valuations contract [and] you’ll see a couple of years of sluggish share price growth as we digest some of the excess,” he said. “It doesn’t always have to be the Nasdaq down 85%.” And with OpenAI onboard and analysts gunning for $300 to $400 targets, traders aren’t easing off the gas.

The plan was revealed during a Futures and Derivatives Law Report event hosted by the law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP in New York. SEC pushes ahead with crypto exemption despite government shutdown The SEC Chair explained that many people who build with digital assets relocate their work to other countries due to unclear or stringent regulations by the SEC. He wants to give people a fair chance to work on new technologies without worrying that the SEC will suddenly take action against them. Atkins said that the SEC expects to propose the official rulemaking process for the innovation exemption no later than the end of 2025 or early 2026, depending on how long this government shutdown is going to have to go.” The agency can still perform some crucial jobs, but the shutdown has halted rulemaking and made it difficult to adhere to planned schedules. He also discussed how the SEC drove many talented developers, engineers, and business leaders out of the United States in search of better opportunities, largely due to strict and unclear rules that instilled fear. “We’ve had four years of repression in that industry, and it pushed innovation abroad rather than keeping it here,” he said. “My goal now is to make people feel they can build in the United States without fearing unclear regulations.” Atkins added that the new exemption rule won’t remove oversight or allow unsafe practices. Instead, it will balance between safety and progress to open doors for entrepreneurs and developers who want to build responsibly but need clear rules to do so. Lawmakers push for new crypto bills in Congress The SEC Chair commended Congress for its efforts in shaping policies that support innovation and referred to the GENIUS Act as a big first step toward building a full national framework for digital assets. He said that the GENIUS Act helps create a more predictable and secure environment for developers, investors, and businesses who have long requested clear rules. He added that the coordination between the SEC and Congress will make it easier for new companies to understand the rules that apply to them and how they can comply. It will also prevent any confusion and overlapping rules that have previously made it difficult for startups to operate. Summer Mersinger, CEO of the Blockchain Association and a former commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), also shared her views on the progress of crypto legislation in Congress. She said that there is a 50% chance that Congress will be able to pass a broader “market structure” bill before the end of 2025, as it still faces numerous political and regulatory challenges. Other speakers, including Greg Xethalis, a lawyer and general counsel at Multicoin Capital, and Chris Perkins, president of CoinFund, noted that progress is still being made, even if it is slow. Xethalis stated that developers are preparing to utilize stablecoins in everyday financial applications, citing Visa’s integration of USDC as an example. Perkins said that the new rules from the GENIUS Act and the stablecoin proposals by the Treasury Department make developers more confident in building in the United States without fear. Mersinger added that stablecoins will also be useful in larger financial processes, such as fund transfers, collateral management, and settlement in complex contracts.

Institutional inflows via Bitcoin ETFs have created durable demand for crypto markets. Spot Bitcoin ETFs now hold more than $169 billion, roughly 6.8% of Bitcoin’s market value (SoSoValue). Custody solutions and wealth manager adoption are enabling large-scale, long-term allocations. Institutional crypto inflows are stabilizing markets and driving BTC gains; learn how ETFs and wealth managers are reshaping allocation strategies — read more from COINOTAG. What are institutional crypto inflows and why do they matter? Institutional crypto inflows refer to capital moving into crypto assets from institutions such as wealth managers, family offices, and ETF vehicles. These inflows matter because they provide steady, long-term demand that can reduce volatility and support price discovery. How are Bitcoin ETFs changing market dynamics? Spot Bitcoin ETFs have shifted the investor mix from retail traders to professional allocators. The first year of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw about $30 billion in inflows, followed by roughly $20 billion this year, with quarterly inflows of $5–$10 billion. These flows now represent over $169 billion in ETF-held Bitcoin, according to SoSoValue, helping to smooth trading and encourage institutional participation. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/crypto/institutional-inflows-bitcoin-etfs"" }, ""headline"": ""Institutional Capital Drives Crypto: ETFs and Wealth Managers Bring Stability"", ""image"": [ ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/coinotag-logo.png"" ], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-07T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/coinotag-logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Institutional crypto inflows via Bitcoin ETFs and wealth managers are providing steady demand, reducing volatility, and contributing to Bitcoin's recent record highs.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Are institutional inflows reducing crypto volatility?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes.

Family offices and high-net-worth clients view crypto as a long-term allocation and inflation hedge. Elliot Andrews, CEO of Aspen Digital, said clients seek consistent, risk-adjusted performance rather than speculative 100x bets, so crypto is becoming a small but meaningful part of diversified portfolios. What infrastructure improvements enabled this shift? Custody has largely been solved for institutions, with providers such as Coinbase, Anchorage, and Fidelity offering secure custody. Regulatory clarifications—like recognizing state-chartered trusts as custodians—have further lowered barriers for institutional participation. Frequently Asked Questions How do ETFs change liquidity in the Bitcoin market? ETFs concentrate demand into regulated accounts and create predictable inflows, improving liquidity and dampening abrupt price swings caused by retail trading patterns. Can institutional inflows cause higher prices long term? Yes. Sustained institutional buying increases demand relative to supply, which can support higher price discovery over extended periods without guaranteeing short-term gains. Key Takeaways Institutional inflows: are shifting crypto from retail-driven cycles to steady, professional demand. Bitcoin ETFs: have collected substantial assets—about $50 billion across two measured periods—helping stabilize markets. Operational readiness: custody solutions and regulatory clarity now allow wealth managers to allocate with confidence. Conclusion Institutional crypto inflows, driven by spot Bitcoin ETFs and wealth managers, are reshaping market structure by adding durable demand and reducing speculative volatility. COINOTAG reports that custody maturity and regulatory steps have made crypto a viable long-term allocation for institutions, signaling a more stable phase for the market and continued professional participation.",News|BTC,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'CoinOtag', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/77/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinotag,2025-10-07 23:58:37

The leading cryptocurrency traded around $125,800–$126,200 on October 7, 2025. The surge reinforces Bitcoin’s status as a global macro asset on the backs of all-time high ETF inflows, institutional accumulation and a sweeping sentiment shift. Simultaneously, early-stage investors eye MAGACOIN FINANCE, a rapidly growing project labelled one of the most promising altcoins for 2025. Having raised over $15.5 million, and analysts expecting a 50x upside, the project is becoming a major topic of discussion among retail and institutional investors alike. ETF Inflows and Macroeconomic Drivers Power Bitcoin’s Record Run Bitcoin’s new uptrend fits a seasonal pattern called “Uptober,” which usually produces big gains for cryptocurrencies in the past years. The combined effect of the favorable macro environment, steeper institutional inflows, and on-chain supply constraints has propelled the momentum this year. Evidence of inflows into spot Bitcoin funds of over $1.6 billion was reported last week. Funds led by BlackRock IBIT and Fidelity FBTC have gained global exposure without custody. Bitcoin is also seeing its exchange reserves drop to a six-year low, with close to 170,000 BTC (over $21 billion) withdrawn into cold wallets in the last month – a clear sign of confidence from the long-term holders. Macro trends also favor continued upside. A weaker US dollar, forecasts for interest rate cuts and concern about the sustainability of government debt have bolstered Bitcoin’s appeal as a hedge against Monetray Risk. We are witnessing the trend of institutional adoption moving beyond financial firms, with sovereign wealth funds reportedly buying up BTC. Analyst Targets: $130K to $135K in Sight Bitcoin looks set for a move towards the next resistance zone of $130,000-$135,000. According to some technical models — including Fibonacci extensions and historical breakout cycles — there is room for price discovery if momentum carries me higher. Traders who trade for short periods of time are waiting to see if key supports between $115,000 and $120,000 result in profitable pullbacks. Moreover, derivative markets have seen rising open interest without funding spikes. In other words, this is not a sign of leverage speculation. Instead, it is a strength that looks more spot led than leverage. If the pace of inflows into ETFs continues, we can expect Bitcoin to move towards $150,000 before the end of this year. This is due to liquidity rotating from traditional assets into the crypto realm via regulated exposure. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The 50x Presale Prospect While Bitcoin has been in the news frequently, MAGACOIN FINANCE could become the focus of discussion. Across large trading desks and retail communities, analysts are identifying it as one of the only credible projects that could do 50x going into the next bull cycle. Strong comparisons are being drawn between the project’s early-stage fundamentals and the pre-listing tokens. Because of its emphasis on verifiable, compliant fundraising and its scarcity-driven model, it has gained traction among serious investors. Experts refer to it as a hidden treasure — one that strikes a balance between meme narrative zeal and disciplined tokenomics. As capital flows out of high-cap assets like Bitcoin, this could support investor rotation into undervalued presales, such as MAGACOIN FINANCE. Market commentators suggest that it’s the top early-stage opportunity of 2025, akin to Solana and Avalanche at the beginning of their own rise in previous cycles. Outlook: Two Sides of the Same Market Story Bitcoin’s latest record-breaking move above $126,000 demonstrates how much the asset has matured from a speculative investment to a macroeconomic asset class. Analysts say that ongoing uptake of ETFs and favourable macroeconomic conditions might see further upside until end-Q4 2025. On the other hand, MAGACOIN FINANCE symbolises the other end of the market spectrum, namely, the high upside innovation frontier, capturing the retail FOMO and further exponential growth potential that still defines the DNA of crypto. Its characteristics of being hard-capped, verifiably secured, and rapidly community-driven give an appealing proposition for 2025. The combination of institutional maturity and MAGACOIN FINANCE’s early-stage momentum represent both strength and opportunity within the new cycle of Bitcoin.

If ADA breaches $0.96 with rising volume, targets range from $1.28 up to approximately $1.90 on measured moves. What Is Happening with Cardano’s Price? Cardano price has been compressing into a symmetrical triangle since late 2024, closing the range near $0.857. The pattern’s converging trendlines imply reduced volatility and a higher-probability breakout as the price approaches the apex. Market participants are watching for a breakout accompanied by expanding volume. Source: Ali Charts Via X How Are Fibonacci Levels Influencing ADA? ADA has repeatedly reacted to key Fibonacci retracement zones at $0.76, $0.96 and $1.87. These levels act as technical reference points where price often stalls or reverses. Historically, bounces and rejections at these levels have influenced short-term structure and trader positioning. Why Does Volume Matter for the Next Move? Volume confirms conviction. On October 4, ADA briefly dipped to roughly $0.83 before buyers pushed the price above $0.87 on October 5. That uptick came with steady volume, indicating broad participation rather than a single large trade. A true breakout will likely require volume expansion to validate follow-through. Source: CoinGecko What Could Happen Next? If ADA holds near $0.75–$0.76 support and breaks above $0.96, the measured move from the triangle projects initial targets at $1.28 and extended resistance near $1.87–$1.90. Conversely, a decisive breakdown below $0.75 risks further downside and a retest of lower support bands. Cardano remains a widely traded Layer 1 blockchain known for low fees and active development. With a market capitalization above $30 billion and daily volumes often exceeding $1 billion, ADA retains strong liquidity, which matters when large directional moves occur. How Should Traders Monitor the Breakout? Watch for a daily close above $0.96 with increasing volume for bullish confirmation. Use $0.75–$0.76 as the key invalidation zone for this bullish scenario. Scale risk using position sizing and stop-losses below support to manage downside exposure.

Fibonacci retracements at $0.76, $0.96, and $1.87 are significant. Traders often use these zones for entries, stop placement, and profit targets because ADA has historically reacted at these levels. How should I manage risk around the triangle breakout? Use a stop-loss beneath $0.75 to limit losses. Adopt position sizing that keeps downside risk acceptable. Consider scaling into positions after confirmation of a breakout with higher-than-average volume. Key Takeaways Consolidation: ADA trades near $0.86 inside a symmetrical triangle, signaling a likely imminent move. Breakout level: A clear daily close above $0.96 with rising volume would validate bullish targets to $1.90. Risk management: A breakdown below $0.75 negates the bullish thesis; use stops and position sizing to manage risk. Conclusion This analysis shows Cardano price consolidating at $0.86 within a symmetrical triangle. Monitoring $0.96 for a breakout and $0.75 as the key invalidation level provides a clear framework.

The broader macro backdrop adds complexity to this moment—gold continues to rise, signaling mounting stress across traditional financial systems and renewed interest in hard assets. Historically, such moves in gold have preceded similar reactions in Bitcoin, often serving as a leading indicator of capital rotation into digital stores of value. Amid this setup, on-chain data from CryptoQuant reveals an important dynamic among short-term participants. The Short-Term Holder Unrealized Profit metric has started to rise, showing that recent buyers are sitting on growing paper gains. This behavior often serves as an early signal of market tension—either preceding a wave of profit-taking or marking the beginning of an accelerated bullish phase. Analysts are divided: some see parallels with previous pre-breakout periods when BTC consolidated before massive upside expansions, while others warn that excessive unrealized profits could trigger a short-term correction. In either case, the data points to an increasingly active market structure, where both macro catalysts and onchain sentiment align for what could be Bitcoin’s most decisive moment since its last all-time high. Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Signal $131K Target Analyst Axel Adler shared onchain insights suggesting that Bitcoin may be on the verge of another major move. According to Adler, Short-Term Holders’ (STH) unrealized profit has now risen to 10%, reflecting growing optimism among recent market participants. This level of profitability has historically coincided with heightened volatility, as traders begin to decide between locking in gains or riding the trend higher. Adler highlighted that earlier this year, when unrealized profits reached 15%, the market experienced a wave of selling pressure — triggering a temporary correction before resuming the uptrend. Adler’s analysis places the next critical threshold around $131.8K per BTC, where short-term holders may again be incentivized to take profits. However, this level also marks a potential acceleration point if demand from institutions and ETFs continues to absorb supply efficiently. The market’s structure suggests that BTC could be preparing for a large breakout after weeks of consolidation near the $125K region. While caution remains warranted due to elevated unrealized gains, the broader macro backdrop — including rising gold prices and liquidity rotation into risk assets — supports the view that Bitcoin’s bullish cycle remains intact. Many analysts expect a strong push toward new highs in the coming weeks if momentum persists and short-term selling remains limited. Bulls Hold Ground Near All-Time High Bitcoin is currently trading around $124,316, consolidating just below its all-time high near $126,000 after a strong multi-week rally from the $109,000 region. The chart shows BTC holding above key support at $117,500, a level that acted as major resistance throughout August and September. Its successful breakout and subsequent retest confirm a shift in market structure toward a sustained bullish trend. The 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages are now trending upward, reinforcing the positive outlook. Price action shows tightening candles near resistance, a sign of equilibrium between buyers and short-term profit-takers. If BTC manages to close decisively above $125,000, it could trigger an acceleration toward $130,000–$132,000, aligning with the next key Fibonacci extension levels. However, momentum appears to be cooling slightly after an extended run, suggesting a potential short-term consolidation phase before another impulse. As long as the price remains above $120,000, the broader bullish structure remains intact. The ongoing strength in gold and renewed inflows from ETFs provide a supportive macro backdrop, hinting that Bitcoin could soon enter price discovery if bulls maintain control and short-term holders resist the urge to realize profits prematurely.

The analyst believes the digital asset will ultimately prove to be one of the greatest assets of our lifetime, reinforcing his consistent optimism about its value and role in the evolving financial ecosystem. A Conviction Shaped by the 2020 SEC Lawsuit In his latest commentary, Coach JV reflected on the origins of his commitment to XRP, which began during one of the most turbulent periods in its history, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020. At the time, the market reacted sharply, with widespread panic among investors and a steep decline in XRP’s price to around $0.17. Rather than follow the sell-off, Coach JV stated that he chose to increase his holdings, guided by his belief in XRP’s long-term utility and the importance of staying disciplined amid uncertainty. He attributes this decision to a combination of intuition, patience, and adherence to fundamental investment principles. Today, with XRP trading near $3 , the token has appreciated by more than 1,600% since the lawsuit was first announced, an outcome that Coach JV cites as validation of his early confidence in the asset. XRP will be one of the greatest assets of our lifetime. From the moment I was introduced to it, I felt it deep in my gut. I remember December 2020 when the SEC launched their case against Ripple. While the crowd panicked, my instinct said the opposite… go all in. And I did.… — Coach, JV (@Coachjv_) October 4, 2025 Longstanding Advocacy for XRP Investment Coach JV has consistently encouraged investors to focus on long-term potential rather than short-term market movements. In multiple public statements, he has argued that XRP represents a generational opportunity within the cryptocurrency space. In July 2025, he emphasized that overlooking XRP could become the greatest missed opportunity for investors. He has frequently advised his audience to practice financial discipline, cautioning against prioritizing short-term lifestyle spending over strategic accumulation of digital assets. That same month, he warned that dismissing XRP’s potential could result in missing one of the largest wealth shifts in modern history. His rationale rests on the idea that Ripple’s underlying technology is not merely competing with existing financial systems but aims to modernize and replace outdated infrastructure. By August 2025, Coach JV expanded his predictions further, suggesting that XRP could surpass both Bitcoin and Ethereum by 2030, citing Ripple’s strengthened position following its legal success against the SEC and its growing consumer offerings, including the Gemini XRP Credit Card. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Community Response and Broader Context Coach JV’s latest remarks have resonated with many XRP holders who share a similar long-term outlook. Community members have expressed optimism about XRP’s future and the potential for significant financial gains over time. One investor, Alex Fifer, mentioned that he continues to accumulate XRP alongside other assets such as XLM and HBAR, viewing them as part of a broader strategy toward early retirement and financial independence. Another community member, Lady Catherine, who has held XRP since 2020, voiced agreement with Coach JV’s forecast but questioned when a major breakout might occur, speculating whether it could take five years or two decades. Additionally, crypto analyst Christopher Greene offered a wider perspective, noting that XRP frequently appears in discussions among major global institutions, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). He suggested that this recurring presence underscores XRP’s growing relevance in conversations about the future of cross-border finance. Despite differing opinions within the cryptocurrency community, Coach JV is confident in his belief that XRP’s long-term potential remains undervalued. His consistent message, emphasizing patience, independent analysis, and emotional discipline, continues to attract attention from investors who view XRP as a long-term opportunity rather than a speculative trade.

52818840,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=834007,1759881655,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/52818840.jpeg,Social Media Turns Bearish On XRP: Is This A Buy Signal?,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/social-media-turns-bearish-on-xrp-buy-signal/,"Data shows users on social media are the most bearish toward XRP in six months, a potential setup for a contrarian move in the asset. XRP Positive/Negative Sentiment Has Plunged Recently According to data from analytics firm Santiment, social media FUD around XRP has seen a spike recently. The indicator of relevance here is the “Positive/Negative Sentiment,” which tells us about how the bullish and bearish sentiments related to the coin compare on the major social media platforms. The metric works by first going through posts/messages/threads on these platforms to separate those that contain mentions of the asset. It then puts them through a machine-learning model to divide between positive and negative comments. Finally, it takes the ratio between the counts of each category to find the net situation. Related Reading: Bitcoin Spot Volume Rebounds As Price Hits ATH, But Still Far Below Late-2024 Highs Now, here is the chart shared by Santiment that shows the trend in the Positive/Negative Sentiment for XRP over the past month: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP Positive/Negative Sentiment fell to a low of 0.74 a couple of days back, implying bearish comments were notably outpacing bullish ones. The metric followed up with some recovery, but it lasted only briefly as the latest value has again indicated a dominant negative sentiment, with the ratio standing at 0.86. This latest wave of FUD around the asset on social media is the strongest since six months ago, when Donald Trump’s tariffs shook the market. If history is anything to go by, though, the bearish sentiment among retail traders could actually turn out to be a positive for the cryptocurrency. Digital assets have often tended to move in a way that goes contrary to the expectations of the crowd. This means that when the investors are overly bearish, a bottom can become probable. Given that social media users have been fearful toward XRP for two out of the last three days, it’s possible that a contrarian signal could once again be brewing for it. It now remains to be seen how the asset’s trajectory will look in the coming days, and whether social media sentiment will play a part. Related Reading: Bitcoin, Ethereum Lead Record $5.95 Billion Inflows Into Crypto Funds In the scenario that XRP does rebound from here, a technical challenge could be waiting for it, as explained by analyst Ali Martinez in an X post. As is visible in the chart shared by Martinez, XRP has potentially been stuck inside a Parallel Channel on the 4-hour timeframe during the last couple of months. The upper boundary of the channel lies at $3.15, which has proven to be a resistance barrier for the coin in this period. “A breakout here could trigger a rally to $3.60!” says the analyst. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is floating around $2.97, up over 4% in the last seven days.

Bitcoin to $140,000 has an estimated 50% probability for October, according to simulations using daily price data from 2015 onward. The model measures historical volatility and repetitive price rhythms to produce probability ranges, indicating a meaningful chance but not a certainty. How did the simulation calculate the 50% probability? The simulation runs hundreds of scenarios using Bitcoin’s historical daily returns (2015–present). It reproduces observed volatility patterns and draws forward paths to estimate end-of-month price distributions. Economist Timothy Peterson summarized the method as “data-driven” and based on real price behavior rather than sentiment. Inputs included starting price, historical intramonth return distributions, and observed October seasonality. The model output shows a median outcome near current levels and tails that allow for a ~50% probability above $140,000. Why does Bitcoin need ~14.7% to hit $140,000 from current levels? At the reported price of $122,032, Bitcoin requires roughly a 14.7% gain to reach $140,000. This calculation is simple: (140,000 / 122,032) − 1 ≈ 0.147. The figure is front-loaded into simulations to show how plausible that move is within a single month given historical October performance. What historical seasonality supports the projection? October has been historically strong for Bitcoin. Since 2013, October ranks as the second-best month on average, with average gains around 20.75% according to CoinGlass. November historically performs best, averaging roughly 46.02% gains since 2013, which underlines the seasonal strength in late-year months. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is the $140,000 forecast certain?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""No. The 50% probability indicates equal likelihood of finishing above or below $140,000; it is a probabilistic outcome derived from historical simulations, not a guarantee."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""What data did the simulation use?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The simulation used Bitcoin daily price data from 2015 onwards, modeled historical volatility patterns and intramonth returns to generate hundreds of potential October outcomes."" } } ]} Prediction described as “not human emotion or biased opinion” — why? Timothy Peterson emphasized that the forecast is based on quantitative simulations rather than trader sentiment. Each projection follows consistent statistical rules that match Bitcoin’s historical volatility and rhythmic price changes. This approach aims to remove short-term emotional bias from the projection. That said, the model cannot capture future macro shocks or regulatory events. Historical fidelity improves probabilistic estimates but does not eliminate unforeseen risks. Since 2013, November has been Bitcoin’s best-performing month, averaging gains of 46.02%. Source: CoinGlass How does market sentiment compare with the model? Market commentary remains broadly bullish after Bitcoin hit a fresh all-time high near $126,200 and later cooled. Analysts such as Jelle and Matthew Hyland (X posts) noted technical retests of highs and growing bullish pressure. These views complement the simulation but are opinion-based rather than probabilistic. CoinMarketCap reporting indicates the recent all-time highs and intraday moves that feed into simulation starting points. Analysts often overlay sentiment and on-chain metrics onto model outputs for a fuller view. Frequently Asked Questions How should traders use a 50% probability forecast? Use it as a probabilistic input to risk management, not a trading signal. A 50% chance reflects mid-range uncertainty; position sizing and stop-loss rules should reflect individual risk tolerance and portfolio objectives. Can seasonality guarantee price moves? No. Seasonality provides a historical tendency. It raises the probability of certain outcomes but cannot guarantee future performance, especially when extraordinary events occur. Key Takeaways Probability-based outlook : Quantitative simulations assign ~50% chance Bitcoin surpasses $140,000 in October. Data inputs : Model uses daily price data since 2015 and historical volatility patterns to create hundreds of scenarios. Actionable insight : Traders should combine probabilistic models with risk controls and consider seasonal trends when sizing positions. Conclusion The Bitcoin to $140,000 projection is a data-driven probability, not a certainty. Historical October seasonality and simulated outcomes support a meaningful chance of a mid-month rally, but investors must weigh model results against macro risks and market dynamics.

Speaking with Cointelegraph at Token2049 in Singapore last week, Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley said that Solana may gain an edge over Ethereum in the staking exchange-traded fund (ETF) market, citing its design as more favorable for investors. The company offers a fund called the Bitwise Physical Solana ETP that provides investors with exposure to SOL through a fully backed, physically held structure with institutional-grade custody. Interest in this area has been muted compared to BTC or Ether-based ETFs, with just $30 million in assets under management, according to Bitwise. The firm also has a spot Solana ETF waiting in the SEC approval queue with the final decision due on Oct. 16. SOL prices were trading down 2% on the day at $227 at the time of writing. The asset remains down more than 22% from its January 2025 all-time high. He said that Solana’s unstaking period is much faster than Ethereum’s, which is important because “ETFs need to be able to return assets on a very short time frame. So this is a huge challenge.” Avalanche: Treasury Company Sparks Price Surge The price of AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche blockchain, jumped after a newly formed company announced its plans to go public in the US and purchase over $1 billion worth of the token. The company, Avalanche Treasury Co., said on Wednesday that it would merge with the special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) Mountain Lake Acquisition Corp. in a deal valued at over $675 million. The merged company anticipates listing on the Nasdaq in the first quarter of 2026 under the ticker symbol “AVAT,” pending regulatory and shareholder approval. Emin Gün Sirer, the founder and CEO of the Avalanche blockchain development firm Ava Labs, will join the company as an adviser. The business will be the second so-called treasury company focused on Avalanche, joining a herd of companies going public or pivoting to buying and holding cryptocurrencies this year. Avalanche Treasury Co. said it has an “exclusive relationship” with the Avalanche Foundation, an organization that supports the blockchain, which had reportedly planned to sell millions of Avalanche tokens at a discounted price to treasury companies. The treasury company said it plans to own more than $1 billion worth of AVAX after it goes public next year, and its initial capital raise “will result in approximately $460 million in treasury assets funded.” Kaspa: High-Throughput Layer-1 Blockchain Kaspa is trading at approximately $0.075 to $0.08, with fluctuations mirroring those of the broader market. Recently, prices have fallen under pressure. It was predicted that the price could drop to about $0.058 in the near term. The price may receive support if it holds near $0.072 to $0.075. If the support holds and buyers step in, it may rebound to around $0.09 or $0.10. The volume of trade has increased now, with the market price at a neutral RSI. Kaspa is receiving popularity because the Layer-1 blockchain uses the GHOSTDAG protocol, which ensures scaling through parallel block creation. The project is highly recognized for strong developer growth and community governance (no VC and no pre-mining). Also, its claim to fame is high throughput. So, it is a strong project for 2025, but very high risk. An Early-Phase High-Upside Growth Opportunity While SOL , AVAX , and KAS are prominent altcoins for investors, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being noticed as a project that could be tipped as one of the best altcoins to buy in 2025. The project has a clear roadmap , a rapidly expanding community, and a growing adoption rate. Investors looking for high-upside growth opportunities are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE closely.

While Ueda faces a tough choice, the central bank has demonstrated its readiness for its first interest rate increase since January. This interest rate hike is expected to occur later this month. However, following Takaichi’s victory, if Ueda decides to proceed with the hike, he might upset a senior official who may desire more influence over the Bank of Japan’s future decisions. Ueda faces a difficult situation in deciding on interest rate hikes During the latter part of his term, Ueda is likely to be judged by individuals not only on how much he can increase interest rates but also on how effectively he can maintain the central bank’s independence . Concerning the situation, reports from reliable sources have highlighted that if the BOJ’s governor decides not to increase rates, as Takaichi’s economic advisers had suggested earlier, analysts speculate that he supports Takaichi’s critical approach to interest rate hikes. Consequently, this could further diminish the yen’s value, posing a significant challenge for both Ueda and Takaichi regarding currency matters as they await the next policy meeting scheduled for the next two months. In a statement, Tsuyoshi Ueno, a chief economist at the NLI Research Institute, pointed out that he has noticed an emerging prospect of an interest rate hike in October, following strong signals from the BOJ and reports on economic progress. However, Ueno also raised concerns that the increasing rates would become more difficult due to Takaichi’s victory. In the meantime, Ueda has showcased his dedication to addressing the leftover impacts of the BOJ’s large stimulus program as the country adapts to increasing inflation . Interestingly, he has already exceeded expectations by implementing strategies such as ending the bank’s influence on bond yields, reducing its large purchases, and ceasing other risky assets. Additionally, he plans to sell off exchange-traded funds before hitting the midpoint of his term. Many believe that increasing rates slowly from negative levels makes sense because inflation is still occurring. Takaichi’s victory raises concerns about interest rate hikes When the Bank of Japan moved to hike interest rates last year, Takaichi referred to the plan as “stupid,” leading investors to think she would halt rate rises if she became prime minister. This comes when she is expected to be elected as premier in a parliamentary vote in mid-October. “Ueda has done well in the first half of his term, but I think Takaichi is going to be harsher on him,” Ueno said. He made this remark in reference to her tendency to get involved in the BOJ’s plans whenever they consider making amendments to the policy settings. Responding to the situation, investors have drastically decreased their expectations for the BOJ’s move this month. On the other hand, Overnight swaps a week ago signaled a 68% probability of a hike in October, following two board members’ endorsement of an increase in September, and one typically dovish member sounded more hawkish. Later, that likelihood had fallen to just over 20%. Takaichi’s economic adviser greatly supported this shift on Monday this week. This was after Etsuro Honda told reporters it may be too early for a hike this month. Get seen where it counts.

The Dell Technologies chief explained that demand for computing power is “tremendous,” but the nonstop building of artificial intelligence data centers cannot continue forever. “I’m sure at some point there’ll be too many of these things built, but we don’t see any signs of that,” Michael said on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.” For now, the surge is still alive, and his company is right in the middle of it. The numbers back it up. The server networking business inside Dell jumped 58% in the past year and then another 69% in the last quarter alone, according to Michael. Growth has been fueled by large language models that now stretch beyond text into multimodal and multi-agent systems, each one pulling more power from chips and infrastructure. That hunger is what keeps orders flowing. Dell expands sales with Nvidia chips and big customers Michael explained that the company’s AI servers are powered by Nvidia’s Blackwell Ultra chips.Those machines are then sold to heavy hitters like CoreWeave, a cloud service provider, and xAI, the startup run by Elon Musk.The stock market reacted quickly to this boom. Dell shares rose more than 3% on Tuesday, right after the company raised its long-term growth outlook in front of analysts. Michael lifted the company’s expected annual revenue growth to a range of 7% to 9%, up from the earlier 3% to 4% forecast.Diluted earnings per share are now expected to grow 15%, almost double the 8% previously targeted. This followed strong second-quarter earnings in August. Looking further ahead, Michael said the company plans to ship $20 billion worth of AI servers in fiscal 2026, which is double last year’s figure. But while sales are exploding, there’s a problem no one can ignore: power. “It’s the clear constraint that we hear about from our customers, including OpenAI,” Michael said. “Many customers, in fact, will tell us, ‘Well, don’t deliver it until this day because we won’t have power in the building to support it.’” Power supply questions loom over AI buildout The scale of these projects is staggering. In September, OpenAI announced a partnership with Nvidia to build at least 10 gigawatts of data centers. That equals the annual energy use of about 8 million U.S. households, based on analysis from CNBC using data from the Energy Information Administration. The largest tech names (Microsoft, Google, and Amazon) have also committed billions of dollars to new AI facilities. Michael pointed out that while Dell can design servers to be as energy-efficient as possible, the reality is that these new projects will consume staggering amounts of electricity. The concern is whether that energy even exists yet. Government data shows the U.S. grid is expected to add 63 gigawatts of capacity in 2025. The 10 gigawatts linked to OpenAI and Nvidia would eat up almost 16% of that total increase. “At the end of the day, if you’re going to generate tens of trillions of tokens, and you’re going to create intelligence and drive the economy forward, you’re going to need computing power and energy,” Michael said.

52820971,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=830478,1759884862,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52820971.jpeg,Thailand set for fourth rate cut under new BOT chief,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/thailand-set-for-fourth-rate-cut/,"New Bank of Thailand Governor Vitai Ratanakorn is expected to lead the country’s fourth interest rate cut this year as policymakers try to support an economy hurt by a strong currency, falling prices, and weak demand. The decision will test Vitai’s leadership and demonstrate his commitment to maintaining a loose monetary policy to support economic growth. The Bank of Thailand’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to reduce the one-day repurchase rate by 0.25 percentage points to 1.25% when it convenes on Wednesday. Most economists expect additional rate cuts in the coming months, as economic growth remains weak and inflation remains very low. BOT signals policy shift as inflation stays weak Vitai Ratanakorn said he wants to follow a friendly and flexible monetary policy that helps the economy grow steadily while also keeping the BOT free from political interference. His first Monetary Policy Committee meeting will reveal how he plans to steer the economy and the kind of message he wants to convey about Thailand’s future growth direction. The BOT lowered its main interest rate by a full percentage point since October 2024 to support the economy after a slow recovery from the pandemic. Some investors now believe there will be at least two more quarter-point cuts in the next six months. However, economists say the bank still needs to do more to help because the economy has not gained much momentum despite the rate cuts. Experts say prices have already been falling for several months, so cutting rates again won’t risk inflation. Economist at ANZ Group Holdings Ltd., Krystal Tan, said the “combination of subdued growth and absent price pressures supports the case for further policy easing.” He added that the policy rate in Thailand could drop to 1% by early next year if the current situation persists. People also don’t know what to expect from the next policy meeting because three of the seven members of the MPC are new, including Governor Vitai himself. The new entries might bring different opinions about how far the bank should go with rate cuts. Economists now have differing opinions, as some from Standard Chartered Bank suggest that the central bank might cut rates by 50 basis points, while analysts at Citigroup expect a smaller 25-basis-point cut. However, they warn that the central bank could be forced to make deeper cuts later this year if the global economy slows further or if exports weaken more sharply. The low level of inflation in Thailand could also lead to another rate cut, as it has remained below zero since April. The prices of goods and services have either stopped rising or have been falling because the current inflation rate is lower than the Bank of Thailand’s target range of 1% to 3%. Exports rose by 5.8% in August, but the increase was the smallest in nearly a year, and economists attribute this slowdown partly to U.S. tariffs. Markets are bracing for a softer baht and new economic support The strength of the Thai baht is also a concern for policymakers. The baht is now the third-best-performing currency in Asia, having gained more than 5% over the past six months. This growth has hurt the country’s exports because Thai goods are now more expensive for foreign buyers. It has also made Thailand a more expensive destination for tourists, who bring in valuable foreign currency. On the brighter side, the strong currency reduced the cost of imports, such as oil and machinery, but the benefit is far smaller than the losses faced by exporters and the tourism industry. The weaker U.S. dollar is one of the factors pushing the baht higher in recent months. Foreign investors are also showing interest in Thailand’s stock and bond markets because of expectations that Thailand’s new government will launch larger spending programs to boost growth. Their investments have increased the demand for the baht, but some of them worry that higher public debt may affect Thailand’s credit quality. These changes have sparked considerable interest among investors in what Governor Vitai Ratanakorn and the Bank of Thailand (BOT) will announce at the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. The MPC will announce its decision at 2 p.m. Bangkok time, and financial markets are tense but remain hopeful.

XRP, Hyperliquid (HYPE), and Avalanche (AVAX) have all entered watchlists thanks to technical patterns, support zones, and momentum signals. In addition to these, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly gaining mentions in analyst circles as one of the altcoins to keep an eye on. While the focus today is on the three above, many investors are using this moment to diversify into promising names that could outperform during early bull phases. XRP: Weakening support may invite pressure XRP turned down from the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) ($2.78) on Sunday and surged to the solid resistance at $2.89 on Monday. The repeated retest of a support level tends to weaken it. If the price breaks and closes below $2.69, the XRP/USDT pair will complete a bearish descending triangle pattern. That increases the risk of a fall toward $2.20. Any relief rally is expected to face selling at the moving averages and then at the downtrend line. The bulls will have to thrust and maintain the price above the downtrend line to indicate a comeback. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Can buyers defend $40? Hyperliquid (HYPE) continued its correction and reached the $40 support on Thursday, where the bulls are mounting a strong defense. The relief rally is expected to face selling at the moving averages. If the price turns down sharply from the moving averages, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the HYPE/USDT pair below $40. If they can pull it off, the Hyperliquid price could plummet to $35.50. On the contrary, if the price continues higher and breaks above $49.88, it suggests that the corrective phase may be over. The pair may then rally toward $59. Avalanche (AVAX): Testing key support after drop Avalanche recently turned down sharply and plunged below the 20-day EMA ($30.09), indicating that the bears are rushing to the exit. The AVAX/USDT pair has declined to the 50-day SMA ($26.62), which is likely to attract buyers. If the price rebounds off the 50-day SMA and rises above the 20-day EMA, it suggests buying at lower levels. The Avalanche price could then consolidate between $26.50 and $36.17 for some time. Instead, if sellers sink the price below the 50-day SMA, the pair could descend to $22.50. That brings the large $15.27 to $36.17 range into play. Analyst notes: Emerging altcoin getting quiet mentions In the backdrop of attention focused on XRP, HYPE, and AVAX, some analysts are also quietly flagging MAGACOIN FINANCE as an interesting altcoin to monitor. Its growing community, capped token supply, and whales backing have drawn early interest. While it doesn’t dominate the headlines now, it’s being mentioned as a potential breakout name behind the scenes, especially by those looking for new opportunities beyond the familiar. This makes MAGACOIN FINANCE one of the best altcoins to buy this week for long term gains. Conclusion This week’s altcoin stories include XRP facing key support and resistance levels, HYPE battling to defend $40, and AVAX testing lower bands after sharp declines. Each shows signs of potential inflexion points, either for recovery or further correction. At the same time, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly entering the conversation as a lesser-known altcoin with growing backing and structural advantages. For investors looking to balance safer names and promising newcomers, it’s worth keeping on the radar as well.

They all show key technical levels being tested — support zones, moving averages, and momentum signals that could clue in short-term direction. Q2: What happens if XRP falls below $2.69? That could complete a bearish triangle pattern and push price toward $2.20 based on the setup. Q3: For HYPE, is $40 a make-or-break level? Yes. If HYPE fails to hold $40, it could drop toward $35.50. A break above $49.88 would suggest the correction may be over. Q4: Why is MAGACOIN FINANCE being mentioned in this article? Because some analysts see it as one of the altcoins to watch behind today’s spotlight names. Its fundamentals and growing interest make it a possible breakout candidate beyond just this week.

The DeFi protocol oriented around utility, available for at $0.035 in presale, has become one of the most quickly developing tokens in Q4 because of its double lending architecture. With over 60% of its Stage 6 presale already sold and whale accounts hoarding increasingly more, Mutuum Finance could offer significantly more upside potential than titanic-cap tokens such as Solana. Solana Rally Continues Amidst Uncertainty Solana (SOL) threw some recent bullishness aside with its 19% gain and breach of the $230 level, technicals pointing to potential to continue to move higher to $253.4 if it can hold the support zone of $210.3–$217.1. Beneath that bullish trend, however, there are warning signs that are increasing. A few of the original investors are selling out, and this is a sign of increasing skepticism that the network is sustainable in the long term. At the same time, falling new address creation is evidence of falling adoption, something that can sap the strength of the existing rally and curtail upside beyond short-term rebounds. And even as Solana’s price action remains in the minds of traders, there are investors switching to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the upstart DeFi coin, which most experts think might have even more growth potential for it in the years ahead. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Phase 6 Tokens are priced at $0.035, 16.17% over the previous phase as Mutuum Finance explodes in presale stage 6. Investor investment is on the high side, with over 16,770 investors putting in over $16.9 million, a sign of confidence in long-term sustainability and prospects of the project in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). As a measure to promote adoption at an early stage, Mutuum Finance is conducting a $100,000 giveaway to reward $10,000 MUTM tokens to 10 winners. Mutuum Finance is dedicated to security. With CertiK, the platform holds a Bug Bounty Program with a $50,000 USDT reward. The program looks to compensate white-hat hackers and security researchers for identifying bugs within the codebase. Bugs are scored in terms of severity as critical, major, minor, and low, and the rewards are paid proportionate for actively securing and maintaining platform integrity. Deploying a Next-Generation Lending & Borrowing Protocol Mutuum Finance has set a roadmap for building a next-gen lending and borrowing protocol with Version 1 (V1) live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, liquidator bot, etc. will be the key features. ETH and USDT will be the launchpad support for lending, borrowing, and collaterals, providing a safe, fast, and easy DeFi experience to users. Collateral efficiency is offered by accurately calculated Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios, particularly in collateral-heavy loans. A buffer reserve is kept within the protocol to mitigate market uncertainty, and excess reserves are wisely reinvested in risk assets to absorb shock without negatively affecting system health as a whole. Such moves deliver a stable, resilient, and sustainable DeFi platform to all. Mutuum Finance is a High-Potential Alternative to SOL As Solana (SOL) eyes the $300 level, profit-taking by early birds and falling adoption ring bells for large-cap investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), at $0.035 with over 60% of Stage 6 presale sold out and 16,770+ investors on board, presents a strong alternative for DeFi exposure. With its dual lending mechanism, next-generation borrowing and lending protocol, dynamic Loan-to-Value ratios, and efficient collateral management, MUTM delivers security and scalable utility. Supported by a $50,000 USDT bug bounty fund and community initiatives like a $100,000 giveaway, Mutuum Finance is one of the most powerful under-$1 cryptos to watch out for in Q4 2025, with development-stage growth potential augmented by a nicely developed utility-driven strategy.

Solana is praised for its speed and ultra-low fees, making it ideal for high-frequency DeFi and gaming applications. At the same time, Ethereum continues to dominate in DeFi, developer activity, and institutional adoption. Alongside these two established networks, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a high-upside altcoin to watch , potentially offering early investors exposure to exponential growth opportunities in the crypto space. Solana vs Ethereum: Comparing Speed, Fees, and Growth Potential Into the 2025 Rally Solana is significantly faster than Ethereum. It can handle about 870 transactions per second (TPS) on average, while it is capable of reaching peak rates of as high as 65,000 TPS and has a block time of approximately 0.39 seconds. The fast speed helps in high frequency defi applications and gaming. Ethereum’s base layer handles about 15 to 30 TPS. Layer-2 Solutions (rollups) are essential for scaling as they offer greater throughput without compromising security and decentralization. Fee comparisons Solana has incredibly low fees, at $0.000025, making it very cheap to send micropayments and transact often. The fees (gas costs) charged on Ethereum’s blockchain are higher and more volatile than Bitcoin’s. They range from $1 to over $30 during congestion. However, Layer-2 scaling on Ethereum is already starting to reduce costs. Growth and Market Outlook Due to its speed and low fees, Solana has strong price momentum and is well-positioned for quick adoption. Traders and applications that require high throughput will be attracted to this. Ethereum is the long-term leader in DeFi, developer activity, and institutional adoption. Significant upgrades (e.g. danksharding) will help with scaling and fee issues. Solana 7-day Price Chart: Source CMC The price of Solana is predicted to be around $232 by the end of 2025, with a possible maximum value of $482 by the end of the same year. Some analysts forecast that it will surpass $1,500 by 2030. Similarly, Ethereum recently broke the $4,000 level. Bullish analysts are forecasting that it will continue rising up to 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE: High-Upside Altcoin Potential While Solana and Ethereum dominate discussions on speed, scalability, and adoption, MAGACOIN FINANCE is quietly emerging as a high-upside growth altcoin . Investors seeking exposure to early-stage opportunities may consider MAGACOIN FINANCE for its structured roadmap , rapidly growing community, and potential for huge ROI , particularly through the promo code PATRIOT50X, which offers extra tokens. Community engagement and wallet activity continue to rise, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as one of the most notable altcoin opportunities emerging from Q4 2025. This positions MAGACOIN FINANCE as a potential candidate for those looking to diversify their crypto portfolio with promising altcoins beyond the established layer-1 networks. Conclusion Comparing Solana and Ethereum , Solana’s speed and low fees offer strong adoption potential for DeFi and gaming, while Ethereum maintains dominance in institutional adoption and DeFi ecosystems . Following a comprehensive Hashex audit , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as a 100% verified and trusted crypto presale, earning confidence from both retail investors and leading analysts. Combining established blockchain networks with early-stage altcoins enables a diversified approach that provides exposure to both proven projects and potential for exponential growth.

He also alluded to the Fed Master application as one of the interesting aspects amid the crypto firm’s move to obtain a national trust charter. Why Ripple Won’t Be A Regular Retail-Style Bank Vincent Van Code stated that Ripple won’t be a regular retail-style bank following the revelation that the crypto firm was a member of the American Bankers Association (ABA) . He stated that it was big news, but opined that Ripple’s application for a Fed Master account is more interesting. The software engineer added that it is surprising how the whole market is oblivious to these advancements and that the XRP price is still hovering around $3. Ripple had, through its subsidiary Standard Custody & Trust Company, applied for a Fed Master account at the same time it applied for a national banking license. The firm’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse , had explained back then that this would enable them to custody their RLUSD reserves directly with the Federal Reserve, further adding another layer of security for the stablecoin. Meanwhile, Crypto pundit unknowDLT was the one who pointed out that Ripple was a member of the ABA, while USDC issuer Circle, which has applied for a national banking license, is not. The pundit further remarked that this means that only one crypto company can be considered a bank. UnknowDLT indicated that big things are in store for Ripple and XRP , declaring that the crypto firm will become the world’s largest bank. UnknowDLT also echoed Vincent Van Code’s sentiment that the market is oblivious to the advancements that are on the horizon for Ripple and XRP. The crypto pundit claimed that retail investors are distracted by memes and Bitcoin. The pundit further remarked that people think that Ripple is dumping XRP on retail investors while the firm continues to build the infrastructure for the new financial system. UnknowDLT added that people have not realized the great potential for appreciation that the XRP will have. The Firm’s Application Open For Public Review XRP influencer Pumpius revealed that Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking license from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is now open for public review. He remarked that the crypto firm is becoming a bank and that the same company the SEC fought for years is now positioning itself as the “bank of banks” built not on legacy rails but on the XRP Ledger . Pumpius added that Ripple’s shift from a crypto company to a liquidity institution is almost complete. It is worth mentioning that the crypto firm is one of many firms that have applied for a national banking license, including Paxos and Circle. Crypto exchange Coinbase also filed for a national trust charter last week.",Ripple|ABA|American Bankers Association|bitcoin|Brad Garlinghouse|Circle|coinbase|Fed Master|OCC|Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Paxos|Pumpius|ripple|ripple news|RLUSD|stablecoin|Standard Custody & Trust Company|UnknowDLT|US SEC|USDC|Vincent Van Code|XRP|XRP Ledger|XRP news|XRP price|XRPL|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|XRP|EXCHANGE|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-08 01:00:22

With the cryptocurrency currently trading around $0.26 after crashing severely in the past few months, the report of new upgrades raises the question of whether these developments could trigger a strong enough comeback to spark a 900% rally back to $2.98. Could Pi Network’s New DeFi Upgrades Spark A Rally? Pi Network’s price faced a devastating correction over the course of eight months, plunging from its February peak of $2.98 to just around $0.26 today. The decline erased more than $18 billion in value in just six months, sparking rugpull accusations as heavy sell-offs from whales and rapidly shifting sentiment drove the market into a downward spiral. Related Reading: Pi Network Price Crashes 88% Since Launch, New Developments Say Further Decline Is Coming At current levels, the cryptocurrency would need a near tenfold rally to revisit its all-time high. Such a rebound is theoretically possible in crypto markets, where significant developments often drive exponential gains. However, with the PI price down more than 85% from peak levels, a surge of that scale remains uncertain. Despite its decline, optimism has resurfaced following Pi Network’s latest ecosystem updates, which could signal a shift from speculation toward sustainable utility. According to the Pi Core Team on X social media, the launch of the Pi DEX, AMM liquidity pools, and token creation tools on Testnet marks the beginning of the cryptocurrency’s new DeFi era. These tools allow Pioneers to swap tokens, provide liquidity, mint test tokens, and explore DeFi mechanics in a safe testing environment. The team noted that the rollout is designed to educate and prepare the community for a full-scale Mainnet DeFi launch where real PI tokens could power transactions and liquidity. They also stated that Pi Network’s vision is to fuel long-term, sustainable Web3 growth through its system designed for utility, apps, and real-world use cases. They added that this vision of steady value appreciation is supported by PI’s infrastructure, KYC-verified global community, Pi wallet and ecosystem apps, .pi Domains, Oi Ad Network, staking, and more. A Deeper Dive Into Pi Network’s DeFi Revolution Pi network’s DeFi expansion, unveiled by founder Dr Chengdiao Fan at the TOKEN2049 global conference in Singapore, represents a strategic pivot toward creating tangible value within its blockchain ecosystem. According to the network’s official blog post, the launch of the Pi DEX and AMM pool will enable the community to build their own DEX and AMM interfaces in a secure testing space. The team noted that this function remains restricted on the Mainnet at this time and is invalid for use or any other purposes. Related Reading: Pi Network Price Crashes To All-Time Low After Latest Announcement — Details Token creation capabilities on the network will also enable developers to mint test tokens on Pi Testnet, simulating app-level economies, community reward systems, and service-based tokens. When the feature transitions to Mainnet, the blog post highlights that strict guidelines will ensure only utility-driven tokens, not empty incentive mechanisms such as meme coins, are approved. This reduces speculative risks and encourages sustainable growth.

Jensen explained the deal on Tuesday during the CNBC Investing Club’s Monthly Meeting at the New York Stock Exchange, adding that OpenAI will now buy Nvidia systems straight from the company instead of through cloud providers. “This is a partnership that, for the first time, OpenAI is going to buy directly from us,” Jensen said. “Usually…a cloud service provider buys from us, and they rent from a cloud service provider. And so now it’s going to be a direct partnership.” The deal is backed by numbers that show just how large it is.Nvidia announced in September that it plans to invest up to $100 billion into OpenAI to build out artificial intelligence data centers.Both companies said the systems will require 10 gigawatts of power. Jensen told CNBC that this amount of energy is the same as running between 4 million and 5 million GPUs. That puts OpenAI on track to run its own computing infrastructure rather than relying on someone else’s servers. Nvidia signs direct AI infrastructure deal The partnership comes as both Nvidia and OpenAI are driving the current AI boom. Demand for Nvidia’s chips began three years ago when OpenAI first released ChatGPT, which introduced generative AI to millions of users. Since then, Nvidia’s market cap has more than tripled, reaching over $4 trillion and making it the most valuable company on the market. Jensen told Cramer that the OpenAI deal is “incremental” compared to Nvidia’s earlier partnerships with Oracle and CoreWeave, because this time OpenAI will run its own data centers. “We’re going to help them build an AI infrastructure that they operate themselves … and really set them up for, you know, five years out, when they’re going to operate their own cloud anyhow,” Jensen said. During the conversation, Jensen and Cramer also talked about China, global trade, and competition with rivals like AMD and Intel. The focus stayed on the scale of the OpenAI agreement, which changes how these massive AI operations are set up. Intel, facing its own challenges, is preparing to show technical details about its next laptop chip called Panther Lake. Four people briefed on the matter allegedly told Reuters that the company will release the information on Thursday. Panther Lake is the first Intel chip built fully with its 18A manufacturing process, a technology the company has spent billions on. It will power high-end laptops and is part of Intel’s push to recover ground lost to AMD. Intel prepares Panther Lake rollout Intel ran hours of technical briefings and factory tours in Arizona last week to present the new Panther Lake microarchitecture to analysts and journalists. The briefings included details about redesigned graphics cores, processor cores, and a new AI engine. Panther Lake will be the first large-scale Intel product made with 18A. The previous generation, called Lunar Lake, was made mostly by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel said Panther Lake will be available in early 2026, and it will use 30% less energy while delivering a 50% boost in certain data-processing tasks. The pressure on Intel is heavy. The company reported a $2.9 billion loss in the second quarter. It also said it could suspend its planned 14A process if it failed to secure a customer. In August, President Donald Trump called for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign. That sparked new investment into the company. Intel secured money from SoftBank Group and Nvidia, while the White House agreed to convert a CHIPS Act grant into a 9.9% equity stake in Intel after Tan met with Trump and officials.

52821717,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=830486,1759886087,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/52821717.jpeg,Canary Capital’s HBAR ETF nears SEC approval,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/canary-capitals-hbar-etf-nears-sec-approval/,"A recent filing by Canary Capital has brought the market one step closer to a key milestone, the potential approval of a spot ETF tracking Hedera Hashgraph’s (HBAR) native token. The submission has fueled optimism among investors and analysts, many of whom believe the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could finally break its streak of delays and grant long-awaited approval. On Tuesday, Canary Capital filed an amended registration statement for its proposed Canary HBAR ETF with the ticker symbol of HBR and a sponsor’s fee of 0.95%. The firm is also verifying an equivalent Litecoin ETF pending under ticker LTCC, with the same fee structure. These last-minute details, tickers, and sponsor fees are typically the final steps before an ETF receives regulators’ blessing. Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas drove that point home in a post on X, where he wrote that “those are the last things to get filled in before go-time.” The 0.95% fee is “pricey compared with Bitcoin ETFs,” says Blockforce Capital founder and crypto asset manager Eric Ervin, but not for newer and more niche products entering the ETF space as a way to gain exposure to cryptos in an already crowded market. The HBAR and Litecoin ETFs are on the 1-yard line, Bloomberg Intelligence’s James Seyffart said, suggesting that a green light will come as soon as the SEC is fully functioning again. This positive new optimism is also backed by HBAR, Solana, and XRP ETFs, which have been listed on the Depository Trust, a technical step that precedes trading approval. The Nasdaq has also filed a Form 19b-4, the regulatory filing form required for the listing and trading of shares of the HBAR ETF once it has been greenlighted. This frenetic blur of activity paints a picture of an ETF that is well past the drawing board phase and is just waiting for the ultimate say-so from one last regulator. SEC delay slows momentum However, in a surprising turn of events, the SEC has delayed its decision on Canary’s HBAR ETF. The next review date has now been extended to November 8, 2025, providing the agency with additional time to conduct its administrative reviews and internal assessments. Industry watchers said that at first glance, the Canary’s HBAR ETF delay seemed more procedural than negative. It was not a rejection, but rather the same process, one market analyst said, with the SEC methodically considering all the proposed crypto ETF applications in its docket after being overwhelmed with new product submissions this year. The delay also comes at a time when the US government is shut down, cutting off some of the SEC’s operations. Its contingency plan permits only a handful of employees to address “emergencies.” That includes some procedures, such as ETF approvals, which have been temporarily halted. Nonetheless, the momentum for crypto ETFs was strong as news reportedly broke that the SEC had recently approved new listing rules designed to streamline the process of approving digital asset ETFs. Crypto ETF market expands rapidly The filing by Canary Capital is part of a wave of broader crypto ETF activity. On that same day, global investment firm GraniteShares applied for a suite of leveraged ETFs linked to Solana, XRP, and Ethereum. Last week, at least 70 other asset managers also filed similar applications, indicating a sharp rise in institutional demand for regulated crypto exposure. The world’s crypto ETFs are setting a new record for total inflows. Worldwide crypto ETFs have attracted almost $5.95 billion in new investments just this month as Bitcoin hits new highs, according to Reuters. Some analysts believe this excitement is also fueled by speculation that the SEC will, at some point in time, greenlight more altcoin ETFs (like HBAR and Litecoin). The approval of the Canary HBAR ETF would be a major win for the Hedera network, which touts itself as a faster, more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional blockchains. The ETF listing will also open up a larger market of institutional HBAR investors who prefer regulated investments. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

As digital assets go mainstream, opportunities once reserved for institutions are now within reach for everyday investors. According to a recent report from Bitget Research, over 580 million people worldwide now own some form of cryptocurrency , up 35% year-over-year, a clear signal that crypto has become a core component of global finance. This shift isn’t just about adoption; it’s about access. Crypto is transforming from a speculative frontier into a generational wealth machine. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs), payment integrations, and cross-border infrastructure are making it easier than ever for individuals to build portfolios that would’ve been impossible a decade ago. As major players like BlackRock, Fidelity, and JPMorgan deepen their presence in blockchain-based assets, analysts argue the next crypto bull market could create the largest wave of new millionaires in history. But while established coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to anchor institutional portfolios, it’s the emerging altcoins , with asymmetric upside potential, that could define who rises next. The Mainstream Explosion: Crypto’s Institutional Validation The current market cycle is unlike any before. In just the last quarter, global crypto ETFs saw more than $7.6 billion in inflows , the fastest institutional accumulation since Bitcoin’s inception. This surge in regulated participation has legitimized crypto in the eyes of traditional investors, paving the way for retail adoption on an unprecedented scale. From corporate balance sheets to pension funds, digital assets are evolving into a standard allocation. PayPal’s blockchain integration, Visa’s stablecoin settlement expansion, and the SEC’s wave of ETF approvals have collectively created a “no-turning-back” moment. Analyst Michael van de Poppe summarized it best: “Crypto isn’t the future anymore, it’s the present. Every day you wait, you’re letting institutional players front-run your chance at exponential growth.” Yet while Bitcoin remains the safest store of value, the real generational wealth often stems from identifying the next breakout narrative early, something that projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are now embodying. Crypto’s rapid march into the mainstream is redefining what’s possible for investors. As institutional adoption rises and retail participation explodes, new-generation altcoins are becoming the engines of exponential wealth creation. Analysts now highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top contender for the next 50×–70× cycle multiplier , citing its viral momentum and disciplined tokenomics. The presale’s current price of $0.00051213 and planned listing at $0.007 encode a built-in 13.6× appreciation window , even before secondary markets open. Verified by CertiK and HashEx , MAGACOIN FINANCE combines meme-style community energy with credible structure, a blend that’s rare in this sector. For investors chasing the next phase of mass adoption, it offers the perfect convergence of accessibility, scarcity, and early-stage upside. As crypto goes fully mainstream, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE aren’t just part of the trend, they’re leading it. The New Path to Wealth: From Accumulation to Acceleration Becoming a crypto millionaire isn’t about luck, it’s about understanding timing, conviction, and diversification. Historically, bull markets follow a predictable rhythm: Bitcoin leads – drawing institutional liquidity. Ethereum follows – reinforcing trust and technical momentum. Altcoins explode – delivering the exponential gains that change lives. In 2021, tokens like Solana, Shiba Inu, and Polygon all produced returns ranging from 40× to 120× in less than a year. Analysts now believe the 2025 setup mirrors that same dynamic, but with even greater capital inflows and global participation. For those entering the market today, the combination of institutional validation and retail enthusiasm makes this cycle uniquely fertile. The difference between a 2× gain and a 50× windfall will come down to early identification of breakout assets, a pattern MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be repeating. Global Momentum: Crypto Adoption and Generational Opportunity Countries across Asia, Latin America, and Europe are embracing crypto as both payment infrastructure and investment vehicle. From El Salvador’s Bitcoin bonds to Japan’s Web3 development incentives, governments are fueling the mainstream wave. According to Chainalysis, emerging markets now account for over 50% of all crypto activity , highlighting a paradigm shift in global finance. At the same time, corporate adoption continues to rise. Nasdaq-listed firms are integrating crypto into treasury strategies, and fintech platforms are offering blockchain exposure to millions of users worldwide. These signals suggest a single conclusion: the window for early positioning is closing. The next 12–18 months could produce life-changing outcomes for those who align early with narrative-driven, transparent projects. Conclusion: The Era of Accessible Wealth For decades, wealth generation was gated behind institutional privilege. Today, crypto has dismantled that barrier. Becoming a millionaire has never been more accessible, but it requires foresight and disciplined speculation. Bitcoin may define the standard, but projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE represent the frontier, where community, scarcity, and structure converge. As digital assets solidify their role in global finance, those who identify credible early movers could stand among the next generation of crypto millionaires. The next wave isn’t coming. It’s already here, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is riding at the front of it.

Strategy holds 640,031 BTC (~$80B at peak): Its BTC stash briefly approached the cash positions of Amazon, Google and Microsoft (each ~ $95–97B). Strategy’s average buy price was $73,981, delivering roughly a 65% unrealized gain (~$30.4B).

What is Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury and how large is it? Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury is a corporate reserve composed of 640,031 BTC purchased at an average price of $73,981. At Bitcoin’s recent record high near $126,080 the stash briefly topped $80 billion in market value, elevating Strategy into the top tier of corporate treasury valuations. Strategy’s approach combines regular purchases with long-term holding, creating a prominent BTC-based component of its corporate balance sheet. Source: Strategy How does Strategy’s Bitcoin stash compare to major tech cash positions? Strategy’s Bitcoin value, near $80 billion at peak, sits close to the cash or cash-equivalent holdings reported by Amazon, Google and Microsoft (each roughly $95–97 billion). Berkshire Hathaway remains the largest corporate cash holder at about $344 billion. Tesla also appears among top corporate treasuries and holds 11,509 BTC, worth roughly $1.4 billion — a small share of its overall cash position (~$37 billion). Why did Microsoft and Meta reject Bitcoin proposals? Microsoft and Meta shareholders voted against proposals to explore Bitcoin as a treasury asset primarily due to concerns about volatility and risk management. The proposals were submitted by a conservative think tank representative advocating for Bitcoin as a hedge against currency debasement. Decision factors cited by shareholders included price volatility, regulatory uncertainty, and fiduciary duty to protect short-term capital. When did corporate Bitcoin adoption accelerate in 2025? Corporate Bitcoin adoption surged in 2025, with over 200 public companies holding BTC — up from fewer than 100 at the start of the year. Rising prices and institutional familiarity drove many firms to adopt or increase allocations to Bitcoin. Strategy’s purchases have been a major driver of market attention, with its average buy price and subsequent unrealized gain frequently reported in corporate finance updates. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""NewsArticle"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/article/strategy-bitcoin-treasury"" }, ""headline"": ""Strategy’s $80B Bitcoin Treasury Nears Tech Cash Giants"", ""image"": [""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199c164-5564-7fc7-b09d-9eddb48ad0d1.png""], ""datePublished"": ""2025-10-08T08:00:00Z"", ""dateModified"": ""2025-10-08T08:00:00Z"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": ""COINOTAG"", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/assets/logo.png"" } }, ""description"": ""Strategy’s 640,031 BTC treasury briefly reached about $80 billion, bringing its Bitcoin holdings close to the cash positions of major tech companies.""} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How many Bitcoins does Strategy hold?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Strategy holds 640,031 BTC purchased at an average price of $73,981, which briefly reached an approximate market value of $80 billion at recent highs."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Did major tech companies miss gains by not adding Bitcoin to treasury?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Yes; Microsoft and Meta rejected proposals to explore Bitcoin when BTC was trading substantially lower, missing double-digit gains as Bitcoin rose to record highs."" } }, { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""How many public companies hold Bitcoin in 2025?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""Over 200 public companies held Bitcoin in 2025, up from fewer than 100 at the start of the year, reflecting rapid corporate adoption."" } } ]} { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""HowTo"", ""name"": ""How companies can evaluate adding Bitcoin to the corporate treasury"", ""description"": ""A concise 4-step approach for corporate finance teams to assess Bitcoin as a treasury asset."", ""image"": ""https://en.coinotag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0199c164-5564-7fc7-b09d-9eddb48ad0d1.png"", ""totalTime"": ""PT14D"", ""step"": [ { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Assess strategic objectives"", ""text"": ""Define why Bitcoin would be added (e.g., inflation hedge, diversification) and set target allocation limits (commonly 0.5–5%)."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Run risk and liquidity analysis"", ""text"": ""Model volatility impact, liquidity needs, and scenario-based stress tests to ensure treasury stability."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Establish custody and controls"", ""text"": ""Select institutional custody, multi-signature governance, and audit trails to meet fiduciary standards."" }, { ""@type"": ""HowToStep"", ""name"": ""Implement phased allocation"", ""text"": ""Start with a small, monitored allocation and scale based on governance, compliance and market conditions."" } ]} Frequently Asked Questions How much gain has Strategy realized on its Bitcoin holdings? Strategy’s average purchase price was $73,981 per BTC. With Bitcoin trading near recent highs, the position shows about a 65% unrealized gain — approximately $30.4 billion in market uplift. What risks do companies cite when rejecting Bitcoin for treasuries? Shareholder concerns commonly include high volatility, regulatory uncertainty, accounting treatment, and potential fiduciary risks tied to short-term valuation swings. Key Takeaways Scale: Strategy’s 640,031 BTC briefly reached ~ $80B, rivaling large tech cash positions. Performance: Average buy price of $73,981 implies ~65% unrealized gains on the position. Adoption trend: Corporate Bitcoin holdings expanded rapidly in 2025, with 200+ public companies holding BTC. Conclusion Strategy’s Bitcoin treasury has emerged as one of the largest corporate Bitcoin reserves, bringing BTC into direct comparison with major tech cash piles. As corporate adoption grows, the debate over Bitcoin’s role as an inflation hedge and treasury asset will continue to shape boardroom and shareholder decisions. For treasury teams, measured governance and robust risk controls remain essential.

The new round is larger than originally expected and is tied to xAI’s plan to use Nvidia processors for Colossus 2, its biggest data center located in Memphis. The total package mixes equity and debt. Reports show that about $7.5 billion is equity while as much as $12.5 billion comes in debt. The deal is structured through a special purpose vehicle that buys Nvidia GPUs and rents them back to xAI for five years, giving financiers a path to recover their money without exposing themselves to company-level risk. Nvidia has not commented on the transaction, while xAI also declined to respond. Elon himself wrote on X in September that the company was “not raising any capital right now,” though this financing proves otherwise. Nvidia invests while Wall Street funds the debt Nvidia is investing equity as a strategy to push its chips deeper into customer systems. The company’s Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress told a Goldman Sachs conference in September that while Nvidia will continue to repurchase shares and pursue strategic deals, its main use of cash is to help other companies adopt AI more quickly. Other financiers are backing the debt. Apollo Global Management is participating alongside Diameter Capital Partners. Valor Capital is leading the equity portion, with Apollo also investing. None of these firms gave public comment when contacted. The raise is more than double the earlier $10 billion figure reported earlier this year, showing the scale of demand for hardware and financing in the AI race. The debt itself is unusual because it is backed by Nvidia’s processors instead of the company. By renting chips for a set period, xAI provides investors with predictable returns while keeping corporate liabilities separate. The arrangement is being seen as a potential model for other tech firms aiming to secure capital without stacking too much debt directly on their books. AI giants secure record amounts for infrastructure The deal comes in the middle of unprecedented capital raising across the AI sector. OpenAI announced a multi‑year partnership to run its systems on Advanced Micro Devices chips. Meta has agreed to a financing deal worth $29 billion for data center expansion. Oracle pulled together $38 billion in debt for its infrastructure. Altogether, tech companies in U.S. bond markets have secured $157 billion so far this year, a 70% increase compared with last year. For Elon, this capital is critical. Bloomberg reported that xAI has already burned through $1 billion per month while building its infrastructure. Earlier this year, the company raised about $10 billion in a mix of debt and equity. Elon has also drawn on his other companies, with SpaceX already investing in xAI. Later this year, Tesla investors will vote on whether to put money into the startup as well. Data center capacity remains a central issue in AI development, as training large models requires huge computing power. While some in the industry debate how much more power will actually improve results, few argue against the need to secure hardware at scale. Elon has positioned AI at the center of his product vision, describing it as the foundation for self‑driving vehicles and fully autonomous robots. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

While the region remains resilient for now, supported by strong public investment, the impact of rising trade tensions is expected to emerge next year. Growth in South Asia is forecast to decelerate from 6.6% in 2025 to 5.8% in the following year, the World Bank said in its latest South Asia Development Update released on Tuesday. The report includes India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan, and the Maldives. The downgrade reflects the anticipated drag from higher tariffs on Indian goods when exported to U.S. markets, as well as weaker overall export performance. U.S. taxes Indian exports and labour-intensive industries The slowdown is largely attributed to trade tensions between the United States and India. U.S. President Donald Trump had earlier this year announced a 50% “import tariff” on nearly half of all Indian exports, one of the most aggressive tariffs ever levied on any US trade partner. The move covers trade in approximately $50 billion worth of exports, and India’s labor-intensive sectors are likely to be hit the hardest. Sectors like textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods, and shrimp are particularly feeling the heat. Exporters in these sectors tend to be small and medium-sized enterprises that depend heavily on the U.S. market, which accounts for approximately one-fifth of India’s total exports. About three-quarters of Indian goods sold to the United States are now being levied these tariffs. The World Bank stated that while the Indian economy is currently bolstered by government spending and domestic demand, these tariffs will have a gradual negative impact on growth from the middle of this year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has been making aggressive strides to alleviate the pressure. Last month, officials announced the largest tax overhaul since 2017, slashing duties on many goods — from shampoos to automobile parts — to spur domestic consumption and business sentiment. While doing so, India has continued to increase spending on infrastructure – including roads, railways, and energy projects – in the hope of spurring economic growth and private investment. These steps are part of a larger plan to strengthen India’s growth foundation amid a global slowdown. The World Bank has raised its projection for India’s growth in the current fiscal year (through March 2026) to 6.5%, from 6.3%. However, it reduced its forecast for the next fiscal year to 6.3%, partly due to the expected drag from tariffs and softer global demand. South Asia’s regional ripple effects India’s economic slide seems certain to wash across its neighbors as well. As the largest economy in South Asia, India accounts for more than 75% of the GDP in this subregion; as such, trade and investment linkages carry significant implications for countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Bangladesh, for example, whose textile and garment exports end up in goods sold around the world, may see less demand for the intermediate goods it ships to India. Sri Lanka, which is dealing with a financial crisis of its own, heavily relies on tourism and trade links with India, which could fade if growth outpaces the need for exports. Remittances and export earnings could also fall for Nepal and Bhutan, destination countries with economies closely connected to India’s. The World Bank report stated that the slowdown in Indian exports would have a ripple effect throughout the region, affecting its industrial supply chains, transportation, and trade services. Trade diversification for South Asia is a key long-term lesson to draw from its current situation. Economists advise, among other things, increasing exports to emerging markets in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, as well as investing more in value-added industries, to reduce dependence on just one or two key trade partners. The World Bank also highlighted the importance of regional cooperation, including in technology, green energy, and digital trade. Greater regional integration of South Asian economies could help reduce external shocks and open new markets. India’s Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, stated that the government would continue to increase its capital spending and support industries through credit and innovation.

Related Reading: Here’s The Best Time To Buy Bitcoin As Impulse Wave Sets Path To $150,000 While near-term momentum has flipped bearish, several on-chain and market-structure cues still point to a potential rebound toward $55–$60 if buyers can quickly stabilize the price above key supports. Derivatives Tilt Bearish, but Spot Holds the Line Futures positioning has swung defensively, and according to Coinglass, the long-to-short ratio slipped to 0.80, its lowest in over a month, signaling traders are leaning short into weakness. Momentum indicators echo the caution, daily RSI near 45 sits below the neutral 50 line, and MACD registered a bearish cross, both consistent with cooling trend strength. Technically, HYPE failed a back-test of a broken ascending trendline and bled nearly 7% from Friday to Monday, with charts flagging $39–$40 as the next major support if selling accelerates. On the upside, $51–$52 is first resistance, where bulls likely meet clustered supply from recent breakdown levels. Why Hyperliquid (HYPE) Bulls Still See $55–$60 on the Table Despite the red prints, spot activity remains constructive. Hyperliquid has been defending the mid-$40s repeatedly, and prior consolidations above $45–$47 have preceded strong continuation moves. HYPE's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: HYPEUSD on Tradingview Under the hood, token staking north of 660,000 HYPE ($30million) plus systematic buybacks are reducing circulating supply, creating a supportive backdrop when demand returns. Meanwhile, protocol fee revenue around $3million/day underscores durable usage even as new perp-DEX competitors court volume with incentives. Community and analyst “fair-value” chatter continues to cluster around $55–$60, suggesting sentiment will likely flip quickly if price reclaims the short-term breakdown area. Price Levels and Trade Map for the Week The immediate trading point sits in $44–$49. A daily close back above $49 would neutralize the breakdown and open $52, then $55–$60 as momentum targets. Failure to hold $46–$47 invites a retest of $44, with a deeper flush risking the $39–$40 demand zone where dip-buyers may step in.

One such debate gaining traction revolves around Tron (TRX) – a veteran of the crypto scene – and MAGACOIN FINANCE, a fast-emerging altcoin that has captured massive investor attention following its record-breaking presale and multiple audit approvals. While Tron continues to hold a strong position in the market with its established user base and DeFi presence, many analysts now believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver far greater upside potential in the coming years. Here’s how the two stack up in terms of fundamentals, growth prospects, and long-term investment appeal. Tron’s Established Ecosystem and Strong Network Activity Launched in 2017, Tron has built a solid reputation as one of the most active smart contract platforms in the blockchain space. The network’s low transaction fees and high throughput have made it a preferred option for decentralized applications (dApps) and stablecoin transfers. One of Tron’s biggest strengths lies in its dominance in stablecoin circulation , particularly with USDT. Data from DeFiLlama shows that a majority of Tether’s on-chain supply flows through the Tron network, accounting for billions of dollars in daily transactions. This widespread usage has given Tron a steady stream of network revenue and consistent demand for TRX tokens. Additionally, Tron’s founder, Justin Sun, has actively pursued partnerships and cross-chain integrations, helping sustain visibility even during bearish periods. However, critics argue that Tron’s growth has plateaued in recent years, with limited innovation beyond its existing DeFi and payments ecosystem. While Tron remains a dependable blockchain with high utility, its upside potential may be constrained compared to newer entrants that are still in early growth stages. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the picture. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Power Player on the Rise MAGACOIN FINANCE has quickly become one of the most talked-about projects of 2025. Following its HashEX and CertiK audits, investor confidence has skyrocketed, with the token’s presale phases selling out faster than anticipated. Analysts now project that MAGACOIN FINANCE could outperform Tron in long-term growth and even secure a position among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap within the next cycle. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its strategic blend of transparency, community focus, and real development momentum. Early investors have already seen returns exceeding 7,800% during the presale period, and many believe that’s just the beginning. The project’s tokenomics are structured to reward long-term holders through deflationary mechanisms and a growing ecosystem that continues to attract attention from retail and institutional investors alike. In addition, MAGACOIN FINANCE benefits from being early in its lifecycle. Historically, coins entering the market with strong fundamentals, visible audits, and an active community tend to outperform older assets once listings begin. With upcoming exchange launches and ecosystem expansion on the roadmap, analysts see enormous potential for sustained upward movement. Many in the community are already drawing parallels between MAGACOIN FINANCE and the early days of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin , both of which delivered life-changing gains for early participants. However, unlike those meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE aims to combine viral community strength with real technological development – a mix that could position it for lasting relevance. Comparing the Two: Growth vs. Stability When comparing Tron and MAGACOIN FINANCE, the decision often comes down to an investor’s risk tolerance and time horizon. Tron offers stability, predictable growth, and a proven network that consistently processes billions in stablecoin volume. It’s a reliable asset for those seeking long-term exposure to an established blockchain. MAGACOIN FINANCE, on the other hand, represents aggressive growth potential. It’s a project still in its expansion phase, meaning early entrants could benefit from exponential upside if it continues to deliver on its roadmap and secure large-scale listings. The token’s audited security, rapid adoption, and viral traction all point to a project that’s moving with momentum rarely seen since the early bull runs of 2021. For many investors, the strategy may not be to choose one or the other, but rather to balance between the established strength of Tron and the explosive potential of MAGACOIN FINANCE. Yet, those who favor higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities are increasingly leaning toward the latter. Conclusion Tron remains a respected, functional, and active network that continues to serve as a backbone for stablecoin transfers and DeFi activity. However, in terms of future growth potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as the more dynamic contender. With full audit verifications, rapid presale sellouts, and a roadmap geared toward innovation and community expansion, it’s no surprise that analysts expect it to outperform Tron and potentially enter the top 100 cryptos by market cap in the next cycle. For investors seeking the next big opportunity with strong fundamentals and explosive upside, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the standout pick for the long term.

Coinbase Premium Gap Is Positive Right Now In a new post on X, CryptoQuant community analyst Maartunn has talked about the latest trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap . This indicator measures the difference between the BTC price listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and that on Binance (USDT pair). The former cryptocurrency exchange is the primary hub for US-based investors, particularly large institutional entities, while the latter is utilized by traders worldwide. As such, the Coinbase Premium Gap essentially represents the difference in behavior between American whales and global ones. When the value of the metric is positive, it means the price of the asset listed on Coinbase is higher than that on Binance. Such a trend implies users of the former are applying a higher buying pressure (or lower selling pressure) than those of the latter. On the other hand, the indicator being under the zero mark implies Binance users are the ones participating in a higher amount of accumulation, as they have pushed the asset to a higher price on the platform. Now, here is the chart shared by Maartunn that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past week: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has remained at mostly positive levels for the past few days, suggesting that buyers on Coinbase have been more aggressive at buying the cryptocurrency than Binance users during this rally . The metric reached its high on October 3rd, when BTC traded at a premium of $140 on Coinbase. During the weekend, the indicator saw some cooldown, with it even briefly turning red during the all-time high (ATH) break on Saturday, but it has surged again in the new week and recovered to a notable positive level of $105. Thus, it seems that despite Bitcoin now entering ATH exploration mode, US-based institutions are only continuing to accumulate more of the cryptocurrency. These investors have been one of the main drivers in the market since last year, so if the Coinbase Premium Gap continues to remain green, the rally could potentially sustain for longer. Speaking of institutional demand, another metric that can correspond to buying/selling from the cohort is the netflow for the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . These investment vehicles saw massive net inflows during the past week, providing further evidence of institutional accumulation. As the above chart shared by cycle analyst Root shows, the latest week of spot ETF inflows was 8.8 times the new Bitcoin supply that miners minted in the period. BTC Price Bitcoin breached above $126,000 on Monday to set another new ATH, but it has since cooled off a bit, with its price coming back to $124,300.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap|Bitcoin Institutional Buying|btc|BTCUSDT|coinbase,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BTC|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-08 02:00:55

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. A7A5’s appearance at the recent Token2049 conference wasn’t in contravention of Singaporean law, despite being backed by a sanctioned Russian bank, highlighting the limits of the city-state’s sanctions regime, which applies only to licensed financial firms. A7A5's ruble-based stablecoin is backed by Russia’s state-owned Promsvyazbank (PSB), an entity sanctioned by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) as well as financial authorities in the U.S., U.K., and most Western jurisdictions . Bloomberg recently reported that the E.U., as a bloc, is considering sanctions against A7A5 too . Indeed, an audit prepared for Old Vector LLC, the parent company behind A7A5, warns of possible ""redemption and regulatory issues"" regarding use of the tokens considering the breadth of the sanctions. Given A7A5 was a sponsor at Token2049, complete with booths and branded massage rooms , one has to wonder if this contravened Singaporean rules given the exchange of funds. The answer, according to MAS, is no. ""Singapore financial institutions (FI) are not permitted to facilitate transactions (whether directly or indirectly) for designated persons in contravention of our financial measures,"" a MAS Spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email. ""An entity that is not an FI regulated by the MAS is not subject to the financial measures."" Under Singapore’s sanctions framework, financial measures targeting Russia’s Promsvyazbank and related entities bind banks, insurers, capital-markets intermediaries, and digital payment token providers. But, according to MAS' own guidance , non-financial companies and individuals are only obligated to comply with United Nations-mandated sanctions, which have never been applied to Russia as the country would veto them as a member of the U.N. security council. Furthermore, Token2049 is organized by Hong Kong registered BOB Group . Hong Kong, as part of China, does not have any financial sanctions on Russia which makes recieving funds from A7A5 legal in the territory. Singapore's sanctions are a bit different from what's been imposed in the U.S. where the company behind A7A5 is Specially Designated National (SDN) under U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) meaning U.S. persons are prohibited from interacting with them in any way. It may seem like an edge case, but Foundation for Global Political Exchange v. U.S. Treasury shows just how far those restrictions can go. OFAC initially denied the Foundation for Global Political Exchange, a U.S. nonprofit, permission to host members of Hezbollah – understandably sanctioned individuals – at a forum they organized in Beiruit about peace in the middle east, ruling that simply offering a platform or audience constituted a prohibited service under U.S. sanctions law. Only after a first amendment challenge did OFAC reverse its position, narrowly allowing participation under strict conditions: no payments, no lodging, no coordination, and no affiliation with the event’s host. By that standard, even in the U.S., hosting A7A5 could be legal if no money or material support changed hands. In Singapore, where sanctions bind financial institutions but not conference organizers, it’s an even easier call. Washington regulates who you can pay; Singapore regulates who can move the money.

Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Wednesday, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 hovered around 48,120 — buoyed by optimism over pro-growth policies under new LDP leadership and a tech-fueled global rally, even as concerns about stimulus durability and valuation risks linger.

Resistance sits at $3.05–$3.12; support ranges are $2.85–$2.90 and $2.20–$2.40. Futures open interest and volume spikes on Oct 3–4 signal increased conviction and potential volatility. XRP price testing $3.10 resistance; watch volume and futures open interest to confirm a breakout — read on for levels, data, and trade signals. (155 characters) What is driving the recent XRP price move? XRP price surged after a wave of high-leverage long liquidations cleared crowded positions, enabling fresh buying interest. Strong volume spikes on October 3–4 and rising futures open interest suggest traders are increasing exposure, making the move higher dependent on sustained buyer conviction. How are futures traders influencing XRP price? Futures data shows accumulation: open interest and average position sizes have increased, which amplifies both breakout potential and downside risk. When open interest rises with volume, momentum is confirmed; if price stalls at resistance, the same leverage can accelerate liquidations. Source: on-chain data and exchange futures metrics (plain text). $XRP heats up near $3.10 resistance as futures traders load up. Will the breakout hold? $XRP price climbs after high leverage long liquidations, signaling fresh buying interest. Resistance lies between $3.05 and $3.12; while support zones hold between $2.85 and $2.20. Futures traders accumulate more, increasing the stakes for a breakout. $XRP bounced back hard after high-leverage liquidations shook the market. Now testing $3.10 resistance, its next move depends on strong volume and trader momentum as it eyes further gains amid growing buying pressure. Why did liquidations spark fresh momentum? The recent price jump in XRP price follows a wave of high-leverage long liquidations that removed crowded positions and triggered short-term capitulation. That selling created liquidity pools that larger buyers and market makers filled, producing a strong rebound. Heatmap and candlestick clusters show heavy volume around $2.90–$3.20, indicating active order zones. Source: CW Via X Price action between October 2 and 5 shows XRP fluctuating mostly between $2.85 and $3.20. A decisive close above $3.12 with follow-through volume would mark a technical breakout. Conversely, failure to sustain above $3.05–$3.12 increases the odds of a retest of $2.85 support. What are the immediate resistance and support levels? $XRP is encountering resistance at $3.05–$3.12 ; buyers have consistently defended $2.85–$2.90 and deeper support near $2.20–$2.40. A clean breakout needs sustained volume above resistance and reduced selling pressure at the highs. Key Levels — XRP Level Range Role Immediate Resistance $3.05–$3.12 Decision zone for breakout Near-term Support $2.85–$2.90 Buy-the-dip zone Secondary Support $2.20–$2.40 Lower boundary for buyers How should traders read volume and open interest? Volume surge accompanied by rising open interest typically confirms trend conviction. On October 3 a volume spike coincided with price strength, suggesting buyers were initiating fresh positions. If open interest falls while price rises, that can indicate short covering rather than new buyer conviction, weakening the breakout thesis. Source: CW Via X With futures trading picking up steam, XRP’s fate hinges on the resistance near $3.10 and support around $2.85. Traders must monitor volume, open interest, and liquidity clusters to anticipate whether the XRP breakout will sustain or reverse. Frequently Asked Questions What is the most likely XRP breakout scenario? If volume and open interest continue rising, the most likely scenario is a confirmed breakout above $3.12 with extension toward $3.40; failure to maintain momentum would see a pullback to $2.85–$2.90. (45 words) How quickly can liquidations change market direction? Liquidations can reverse short-term direction within hours, especially when leverage is high. A cascade of forced sells or covers can amplify moves; monitor leverage metrics and exchange funding rates to anticipate rapid swings. Key Takeaways Momentum source : Liquidations cleared positions and enabled buyers to push price higher. Decision zone : $3.05–$3.12 is the key resistance range to watch for an XRP breakout. Trade signal : Confirm breakout with rising volume and open interest; otherwise expect a retest of $2.85 support. Conclusion In summary, XRP price is testing a critical resistance area around $3.10 after a rebound from $2.85, driven by liquidations and increased futures activity. Monitor volume and open interest for confirmation of an XRP breakout, and prepare for higher volatility as traders size positions.

Bloomberg reported Tuesday that the UK’s Bank of England plans to grant waivers to certain firms, such as crypto exchanges that may need to hold large amounts of stablecoins for liquidity and settlement. The bank also intends to permit the use of stablecoins as settlement assets in its Digital Securities Sandbox, offering a controlled environment for testing blockchain-based issuance and trading. Britain’s Tougher Stance On Stablecoins Contrasts With US Rules The decision comes as industry voices raise concerns that the UK risks losing ground to the US , where the Trump administration’s GENIUS Act has already established rules around dollar-backed stablecoins. Market participants argue that Britain’s tougher posture could divert liquidity and innovation to New York instead of London. The Bank of England plans to grant exemptions to proposed limits on stablecoin holdings by businesses, indicating a softening stance toward cryptoassets amid growing competition from the US https://t.co/rCaBh2rYA4 — Bloomberg (@business) October 7, 2025 At the heart of the debate are ownership caps the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority have floated. Officials suggested limits of up to £20,000 for individuals and £10m for businesses on systemic stablecoins, those widely used for payments. A consultation paper expected by the end of the year will detail the proposed rules. Bailey’s Recent Comments Mark Shift From Earlier Skepticism Toward Stablecoins Governor Andrew Bailey has long been skeptical of stablecoins, warning earlier this year that they could erode public trust in money. He has spoken more favorably about tokenized bank deposits as a safer path. Yet, in recent weeks, Bailey has acknowledged that stablecoins may drive innovation and could co-exist with the traditional financial system. The shift matters because stablecoins are increasingly seen by banks and fintech firms as a faster, cheaper alternative to traditional payment rails. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates they could be used for more than $50 trillion in payments by 2030. Global circulation already exceeds $300b, but sterling-pegged tokens remain negligible at just $581,000, compared with $468m in euro-linked stablecoins, according to DefiLlama data. Industry executives say this imbalance shows the UK is falling behind. Industry Pressure Prompts Softer Approach To Stablecoin Regulation In Britain The Bank of England has acknowledged the pushback and is revising earlier plans. Officials are reportedly considering allowing systemic stablecoins to back some of their reserves with high-quality assets such as short-term government bonds. That would bring the rules closer to frameworks in the US and EU, easing some of the industry’s concerns. The Digital Securities Sandbox will also play a role in shaping the final approach. The pilot environment will permit firms to use regulated stablecoins tied to non-sterling currencies for settlement, giving regulators a chance to study their effectiveness in real-world use cases before finalizing wholesale rules. Stablecoins remain a small part of the UK market today, but their rapid global growth and the competition from overseas frameworks are forcing regulators to move faster. For the Bank of England, carving out exemptions may be the first step in balancing oversight with innovation.

BNB rally fueled by real on‑chain growth and Chainlink data integration Daily transactions climbed to 10–17 million, signalling organic adoption beyond speculation. Technical indicators (ADX 57, +DI above −DI) and social metrics (Social Dominance 2.67%) back continued momentum. BNB rally heats up: Binance Coin surges on-chain activity and Chainlink utility—read the latest analysis and short-term outlook. What is driving BNB’s recent rally to record highs? BNB rally is being driven by a sustained increase in BNB Chain on‑chain activity and the recent Chainlink integration that publishes official U.S. economic data on‑chain. This combination increased utility for DeFi and risk‑management apps and raised investor conviction, not just speculative flows. How strong is the on‑chain growth behind Binance Coin’s surge? Daily transactions on BNB Chain ranged between 10 and 17 million , marking one of the network’s most persistent growth windows. Developer activity and new smart‑contract deployments rose in tandem, indicating usage by real applications rather than short‑term trading bots. Chainlink integration propels BNB toward utility BNB Chain’s adoption of Chainlink’s data standard has enabled official U.S. economic feeds—GDP and the PCE Price Index—on the blockchain. That bridged macro data with smart contracts and opened new use cases in DeFi, prediction markets, and risk management. The integration enhances BNB Chain credibility and supports durable demand from projects requiring verifiable macro data. Sources: Chainlink data feeds (plain text), official metrics reported publicly (plain text). Will BNB bulls maintain control above support levels? BNB is trading above the $1,240 support zone and the 4‑hour structure shows ascending price action with consistent buying pressure. Technical indicators reinforced the bullish thesis: the DMI showed +DI above −DI , and the ADX at 57 signalled a strong directional trend. If momentum persists, a test of the $1,360 resistance becomes likely in the short term. Source: TradingView Rising optimism in sentiment and social buzz for BNB Santiment data recorded Binance Coin’s Social Dominance at 2.67% and Weighted Sentiment at 1.81 , the highest levels in months. The social uptick aligned with both the Chainlink announcement and higher BSC activity. Historically, sentiment spikes of this magnitude often precede extended rallies; combined with on‑chain growth, the data point toward sustained bullish bias. Source: Santiment Can network growth sustain this rally? Yes — current evidence points to sustainable drivers: organic transaction growth, developer engagement, and new on‑chain utility from Chainlink data feeds. These foundations reduce the risk that the rally is solely speculative. However, macro liquidity and broader crypto market trends remain relevant. Continued monitoring of on‑chain metrics and sentiment is necessary to confirm a multi‑month uptrend. How should traders and investors assess risk? Check on‑chain activity: sustained daily transactions and active addresses signal adoption. Monitor technical support: maintain stops below the $1,240 zone and track ADX and DMI for trend health. Watch sentiment and macro data: social dominance and Chainlink feed adoption indicate utility demand.

Official Chainlink economic data feeds and sustained network transaction growth triggered renewed demand, lifting BNB to fresh highs as utility use cases expanded. How should I set risk controls for BNB trades? Use a stop below the $1,240 support zone, size positions to account for volatility, and reassess stops if ADX and volume diverge from price action. Key Takeaways On‑chain growth matters : Persistent daily transactions (10–17M) point to real usage, not only speculation. Chainlink adds utility : Official macro feeds increase DeFi and risk‑management use cases on BNB Chain. Monitor technicals and sentiment : ADX, DMI, and social metrics should guide risk management and timing decisions. Conclusion BNB’s rally reflects a shift toward utility‑driven demand, supported by on‑chain adoption and Chainlink’s data integration. Continued monitoring of transaction volumes, technical indicators, and sentiment will determine whether this breakout matures into a longer‑term uptrend.

Canary filed final amendments adding 0.95% fees and tickers LTCC and HBR. Approval timing is uncertain due to the US government shutdown and limited SEC staffing. Fees exceed spot Bitcoin ETF averages (0.15–0.25%), but are typical for niche or newly ETF-ed assets. Canary Capital Litecoin and HBAR spot ETFs appear finalized but delayed by the US government shutdown — read fees and timing now. What is the current status of Canary Capital’s Litecoin and HBAR spot ETFs? Canary Capital Litecoin and HBAR spot ETFs show final amendments adding a 0.95% fee and the tickers LTCC and HBR, signals that filings are near completion. Approval is likely paused while the US government shutdown limits Securities and Exchange Commission operations, leaving precise launch timing unknown. How were the filings updated and what do the changes mean? Canary filed amendments on Tuesday that added a management fee of 0.95% and assigned tickers LTCC (Litecoin) and HBR (Hedera). Market analysts, including Bloomberg ETF analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart, view these changes as typical final updates prior to launch. Those amendments usually indicate readiness to list, but actual approval depends on the SEC resuming normal review processes. Publication and approval timelines are therefore in limbo while staffing and deadlines remain affected by the shutdown. Source: James Seyffart Why are the fees for these ETFs higher than spot Bitcoin ETFs? Spot Bitcoin ETFs generally charge between 0.15% and 0.25% (source: Ledger). Canary’s 0.95% fee is higher, reflecting the premium often applied to newer, niche or less liquid assets when packaged as ETFs. Analyst Eric Balchunas noted that higher fees are “pretty normal” for emerging ETF product categories. If significant investor flows occur, competitors may introduce lower-fee alternatives to capture market share. How could the government shutdown affect ETF approvals? The US government shutdown, effective Oct. 1, reduced SEC staffing and left many pending ETF decisions unaddressed. The SEC indicated it would operate with a skeleton crew, but major approval actions are likely delayed until full operations resume. 16 crypto ETF decisions were anticipated in October; those deadlines now face uncertainty. New listing standards announced in September could accelerate approvals once the SEC can fully engage, but the immediate effect is a pause in final rulings. Are other issuers still filing ETFs during the shutdown? Yes. Analysts report numerous filings for leveraged and 3x offerings despite the shutdown. Issuers such as Tuttle Capital, GraniteShares, and ProShares (reportedly active in filings) have submitted batches of applications, some proposing 3x leverage via swaps and options. Source: Eric Balchunas What could ETF approvals mean for altcoins like LTC and HBAR? Analysts from Bitfinex predicted that altcoin-linked ETFs could broaden investor access and spur renewed rallies in the underlying tokens. ETF listings typically lower barriers for institutional and retail buyers, potentially increasing liquidity and visibility for Litecoin and Hedera. However, actual market impact depends on product uptake, fee levels, and competing issuer strategies. If flows are limited, price effects may be muted compared with the potential outcome of significant inflows.

Once the SEC returns to full staffing, approvals could proceed if filings remain unchanged. Analysts view Canary’s amendments as a sign of readiness, though final decisions depend on regulatory review and any further comments from the SEC. How do 3x ETF filings affect the market during a shutdown? Issuers continue filing 3x ETF applications because such products can be profitable; however, regulatory scrutiny over leverage and investor protection remains a major hurdle and approvals may be slower during reduced operations. Key Takeaways Filings near completion : Canary added 0.95% fees and tickers LTCC and HBR, typical final amendments. Approval delayed : The US government shutdown has paused many SEC actions, leaving launch timing uncertain. Market impact conditional : ETF listings could boost LTC and HBAR liquidity, but fees and investor flows will shape outcomes. Conclusion Canary Capital’s Litecoin and HBAR spot ETFs show the hallmarks of finalized filings, including the 0.95% fee and new tickers, but the US government shutdown has put approvals on hold. Watch for SEC staffing updates and issuer responses; the approval window will likely reopen once regulators resume full operations.

On one side are tokens leveraging artificial intelligence to power automation, analytics, and decentralized decision-making. On the other, memecoins, born from culture and community, are surging on sheer viral momentum. Both are attracting capital, attention, and speculation at record pace. Recent data from CoinMarketCap reveals that AI tokens have collectively reached over $34.4 billion in market cap this quarter, fueled by partnerships between AI firms and blockchain projects. Meanwhile, memecoins such as Dogecoin, Bonk, and Brett have posted double-digit weekly gains as social media sentiment spikes. The question for investors isn’t which narrative is louder, it’s which one will deliver the bigger returns as 2025 unfolds. And according to analysts, one project is bridging both narratives in real time, MAGACOIN FINANCE , a rising star that merges the cultural power of memes with the credibility of advanced blockchain design. The Rise of AI Cryptos AI cryptos have surged back into focus as generative intelligence reshapes global technology markets. Projects like ChainOpera AI , Fetch.ai , and SingularityNET are demonstrating how machine learning models can enhance on-chain data processing, predictive trading, and decentralized governance. ChainOpera AI, for instance, jumped over 600% in 24 hours after its listing on OrangeX, propelled by its dual appeal to tech developers and traders chasing the next data-driven edge. The momentum reflects a broader theme, investors are looking for tokens tied to real-world innovation rather than pure speculation. As more AI networks expand into DeFi, analytics, and gaming, these tokens are becoming the intellectual backbone of crypto, logical, scalable, and grounded in measurable performance. But logic doesn’t always drive markets, emotiondoes. And that’s where memecoins continue to win. The Power of Memecoins: Culture as Currency Memecoins remain the heartbeat of retail speculation. From Dogecoin’s Twitter-fueled rallies to Shiba Inu’s multi-billion-dollar rise, these assets have proven that cultural connection can outperform utility. Traders chase relatability, humor, community, and rebellion, more than whitepapers. This year alone, memecoin trading volumes have surpassed $24 billion , according to Kaiko Analytics, with Solana-based coins like Bonk and WIF leading the charge. Their simplicity and community-driven marketing make them easy to adopt and impossible to ignore. But with thousands of copycat projects flooding the market, differentiation is now the key to survival. Investors are searching for memecoins that combine viral power with actual structure – and MAGACOIN FINANCE has stepped in to define that category. The crypto market’s next defining clash is underway, artificial intelligence tokens versus meme-powered communities. AI cryptos are surging on real-world innovation and utility, but memecoins continue to dominate retail attention through pure viral energy. Between these two extremes, analysts say one project is bridging both worlds: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Combining cultural identity with a disciplined, data-backed structure, it’s carving a middle path between hype and fundamentals. Audited by CertiK and HashEx , MAGACOIN FINANCE delivers the credibility missing from most meme projects while maintaining the emotional resonance that fuels mass participation. Traders argue that while AI coins may bring long-term adoption, memecoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE can still deliver faster and larger ROI within each cycle. As narratives collide in 2025, the outcome may not be AI versus memes, but rather which project captures both intelligence and imagination in one unstoppable trend. How AI and Memecoins Represent Two Sides of the Same Market At first glance, AI cryptos and memecoins seem opposites: logic versus emotion, data versus memes, innovation versus chaos. But at their core, both express the same investor desire, participation in narratives that feel alive. AI projects offer intellectual engagement, investors buy into the idea of future technology disrupting finance. Memecoins offer emotional engagement, investors buy into communities that represent freedom and humor. Together, they form the yin and yang of crypto’s speculative psychology. Projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE prove that the next generation of winners won’t choose between structure and story. They’ll blend them. Its audited framework ensures it passes the legitimacy test, while its cultural branding ensures it captures public imagination. Market Outlook: Where the Next 50× Opportunities Lie Analysts from 10x Research and CryptoQuant agree: altcoin season 2025 will not be led by a single category . Instead, capital will oscillate between AI-driven projects, yield-based DeFi, and community-led memecoins. Liquidity from Bitcoin’s ETF boom will spill over into smaller tokens that can absorb volatility and amplify returns. For investors seeking 50× potential, the winning formula will include: Timing – entering before exchange listings. Credibility – verified audits and transparent tokenomics. Community – consistent, authentic engagement. By these standards, MAGACOIN FINANCE currently checks every box. It represents both sides of the market’s psychology, technical discipline for institutions and meme-driven hype for retail. The Final Word: Intelligence Meets Hype The 2025 crypto bull run won’t be a battle between AI and memes, it will be a convergence. The biggest winners will blend intelligence, humor, scarcity, and scale. As Bitcoin stabilizes and ETF liquidity expands, traders are migrating to assets that can deliver exponential returns while holding structural integrity. MAGACOIN FINANCE sits squarely in that crossfire, the first major project to channel both AI precision and meme virality into one movement. Whether 2025 becomes the year of AI or the year of memes, one thing is certain: projects capable of merging both will define the era. And right now, MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading that charge.
