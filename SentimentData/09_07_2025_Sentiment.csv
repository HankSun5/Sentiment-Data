Analysts Eye MAGACOIN FINANCE, Dogecoin, and Avalanche",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/best-low-cap-coins-for-100x-gains-analysts-eye-magacoin-finance-dogecoin-and-avalanche/,"The crypto market’s hunger for breakout opportunities has analysts revisiting low-cap coins that could deliver exponential returns. Among the names getting the most attention in 2025 are MAGACOIN FINANCE, Dogecoin, and Avalanche—each with a different story, different trajectory, and vastly different 100x odds. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Top Contender for 100x in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the most talked-about early-stage meme-powered altcoins of the year. With a current price still under a cent and massive online momentum, some analysts believe the token offers the strongest path to 100x returns in this cycle. Forecasts suggest that even a modest rise to its projected listing value could deliver a 25x return for early participants. More aggressive projections go much further, with targets ranging from $1 to as high as $5, depending on how far the meme narrative and community push the token in a bull market. Based on its current valuation, even hitting $0.027 would be enough for a full 100x—something analysts say is realistic if momentum continues. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out isn’t just the price point. It’s the mix of strong presale traction, a fully audited contract, and a zero-tax trading structure that appeals to early adopters. Add in a politically charged meme identity and a fast-growing community of over 12,000 holders, and you get a high-risk token that many view as a serious high-reward play. Dogecoin and Avalanche Offer Stability, But Not Explosive Growth Dogecoin still commands loyalty from retail investors and remains one of the most recognizable names in crypto. Priced around $0.22, it has room for growth in the next bull run—but not enough to offer a 100x return. Analysts see possible price action lifting it to $1.25 at most. To 100x from current levels, DOGE would need to climb to $22, which is viewed as a long shot due to its already massive market cap and circulating supply. Avalanche, on the other hand, is seen as a more technically sophisticated option. With a price hovering between $25 and $26, it continues to grow its presence in the DeFi and enterprise sectors. AVAX could see solid price gains in the future, with some analysts forecasting it could hit $100 or even $160 during peak market conditions. But even the most bullish predictions don’t come close to the kind of returns that smaller, early-stage projects can offer. For Avalanche to deliver a 100x, the price would need to cross $2,500—a scenario analysts consider unrealistic unless bought at much lower levels. What Analysts Are Watching Now Beyond these three names, a few other tokens are also entering the conversation. PeiPei (PEIPEI) is one of the newer meme coins gaining traction. Projects like GameSwift and Hivemapper are drawing attention for their innovation in gaming and decentralized infrastructure. AI-focused coins such as Fetch.AI, Akash Network, and Bittensor also show potential—especially as AI and crypto continue to converge. Still, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in a league of its own when it comes to low-cost entry and sheer narrative power. The project has captured early attention and built a loyal base around its anti-centralization ethos, grassroots appeal, and meme-fueled marketing. Final Take For investors seeking massive upside in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the most realistic shot at 100x returns—if momentum continues and broader market sentiment turns bullish. Dogecoin and Avalanche remain solid names but are unlikely to deliver outsized gains from their current valuations. As always, low-cap crypto investments come with high risk. But when timed right, they can also deliver the kind of life-changing returns the market is chasing.

47835982,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=762489,1752014175,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47835982.jpeg,Cathie Wood doubles down on Elon Musk support amid Tesla's slow revival,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cathie-wood-doubles-down-on-elon-musk/,"Cathie Wood is still all-in on Elon Musk, even as Tesla stock continues to tank and his political ambitions get louder. Speaking on Bloomberg Television this week, the Ark Invest founder defended the CEO while shares in the electric car company kept falling. The stock dropped nearly 7% on Monday, wiping out $68 billion from Tesla’s market cap, after Musk said he was starting a new political party. But Cathie, who’s been holding Tesla in her funds since 2014, said she’s not worried. According to Bloomberg, Cathie pointed to Elon’s recent decision to take over Tesla’s sales in the US and Europe as a sign that he’s finally focusing on the company again. She said: “One of the announcements Elon made recently is that he is going to oversee sales in the US and in Europe. When he puts his mind on something, he usually gets the job done. So I think he’s much less distracted now than he was, let’s say, in the White House 24/7.” The timing comes as Tesla’s market position in Europe and China weakens, with falling deliveries and customer pushback. Musk forms political party while Tesla stumbles Elon’s announcement over the weekend added another layer of chaos. He said he’s launching the “America Party” to take on both Republicans and Democrats in the upcoming House and Senate races. He also didn’t rule out backing a presidential candidate. This comes as Donald Trump, now serving again as US President, has regained his grip over the Republican Party. Wall Street didn’t love that. The stock’s decline added to a rough year, Tesla is now down 27% in 2025 and has dropped in eight of the last nine sessions. Elon’s change toward politics hasn’t helped, especially in international markets where sales are slipping. But Cathie isn’t pulling back. She’s betting that Tesla’s next growth wave will come from the robotaxi project. She previously told Bloomberg that the stock could hit $2,600 within five years, nearly nine times where it trades now, and that 90% of the company’s future value will come from that robotaxi rollout. Her support isn’t limited to Tesla. Cathie also holds positions in Elon’s other companies, including xAI, SpaceX, and Neuralink. She’s stayed quiet on the political drama, saying, “We’ve been dealing with controversy around Elon Musk in one form or another since we first bought the stock. We do trust the board and the board’s instincts here and we stay out of politics.” Dan Ives clashes with Musk over control and accountability On Tuesday, the heat turned up when Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities and one of Tesla’s most bullish analysts, called for urgent changes. Ives has the highest Tesla price target on Wall Street — $500 — but he took to X to criticize Elon’s political detour and recommended that the board take control. He laid out three suggestions: give Elon a new pay package that gives him 25% voting power, greenlight a merger with xAI, and set clear limits on how much time he spends away from Tesla. Elon didn’t respond quietly. “Shut up, Dan,” he wrote on X, brushing off all of Ives’ proposals. It didn’t matter that Ives’ first idea actually supports Elon’s long-held desire for more control of Tesla. The post drew even more attention to the mess unfolding inside the company. That same day, Ives and his team released a detailed note titled, “The Tesla board MUST Act and Create Ground Rules For Musk; Soap Opera Must End.” It said Elon’s decision to enter politics marked a “tipping point in the Tesla story” and warned that the board needs to intervene before more value gets destroyed. Still, Wedbush held its buy rating and price target. Meanwhile, the stock bounced slightly on Tuesday, climbing 1.3%. But the bigger issues remain. Elon’s involvement in US politics, combined with falling sales and slipping deliveries in Europe and China, has raised fresh concerns about the company’s direction. Cathie, though, hasn’t budged. She’s still backing the board. She’s still holding Tesla. And she’s still betting on Elon’s long game, robotaxis, AI, and whatever else he decides is the next frontier. Outside of Tesla, Cathie also called out Apple’s recent loss of its top AI executive to Meta. “If you think about the ultimate mobile device, it’s an autonomous vehicle and that should have been Apple’s to win,” she said. She believes the Apple Car was the biggest AI project out there and now that another talent is gone, the company is “in a precarious position.” Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg is going all-in on AI, trying to compete with OpenAI and Google. Cathie said Meta’s open-source strategy in generative AI is “quite admired,” but questioned if Zuckerberg is just repeating his metaverse misstep. Even with all the chaos, Cathie isn’t walking away from Elon or his companies. She’s been through the noise before and doesn’t seem fazed by the current firestorm. As for Dan, he’s not changing his stance either. In an email to CNBC, he wrote, “Elon has his opinion and I get it, but we stand by what the right course of action is for the Board.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Over the past three weeks, an average of 130 million $GALA tokens per day have been bridged into GalaChain . With the recent updates to the Founder Node rewards system there is an increasing use of network’s features. Updated Node Staking Model Now Live On June 16, 2025, Gala launched a new model for how Founder Node rewards are earned. Node operators are now required to hold $GALA in their GalaChain wallet or allowance in order to receive rewards. To earn 100% of the daily rewards per node, a user must hold 1 million $GALA. Holding less still earns rewards, but at a lower percentage based on the amount held. This update aligns node rewards with participation and encourages direct engagement on GalaChain. In a future phase, the system will shift from just holding $GALA to requiring it to be locked for additional user participation. As part of this staking update, Gala also introduced a new token called $GSTAKE. Once live, it will let users stake with $GSTAKE instead of $GALA, with a 1:1 ratio for rewards. $GSTAKE will be minted by converting specific NFTs purchased with $GALA. Details on which NFTs qualify and how the conversion works will be shared before the second phase of the rollout. Once live, $GSTAKE will be tradable on Gala Connect, GalaSwap, and possibly other platforms. Simplified rewards Even with large volumes of $GALA being bridged to GalaChain, enough liquidity remains on exchanges. This ensures that new users can still access the token easily while long-term holders benefit from better integration and utility. With billions in $GALA now moving to Galachain, the momentum across the ecosystem is strong. It reflects the growing confidence of the community with the upcoming launch of GalaSwap, Gala’s own DEX, is adding to the momentum.

While bulls have successfully flipped $2,500 from resistance into support, the price still faces significant pressure below the $2,700 zone. This range-bound behavior has persisted since early May, and the coming days are likely to define the next major move, not only for ETH but also for the broader altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Range Tightens – Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350 Top analyst Ted Pillows shared technical insights, highlighting Ethereum’s current structure, particularly after the $2,500 level was reclaimed. However, the next challenge lies in reclaiming the range high. A breakout above this key resistance could trigger a strong bullish continuation and potentially ignite an altseason, as capital often rotates into altcoins once ETH gains momentum. On the flip side, failure to sustain current support may open the door for a pullback toward lower demand levels. For now, bulls appear to be in control, but the market remains on edge, awaiting a decisive move. Whether ETH can build enough strength to break through resistance or slips into another leg of consolidation will likely shape sentiment and positioning for the weeks ahead. Ethereum Builds Strength As It Eyes Range High Ethereum continues to trade within a well-defined consolidation zone, oscillating between $2,400 and $2,700 since early May. After reclaiming the $2,500 level and flipping it into support, ETH now looks poised for a potential breakout. Ted Pillows highlighted this shift in momentum, stating that Ethereum is “looking good” and could soon revisit the upper boundary of the range. However, despite Ethereum’s strength, broader market conditions remain mixed. Bitcoin’s failure to break above its all-time high adds pressure to the crypto market, and altcoins continue to struggle to find solid footing. While macroeconomic uncertainty has eased following encouraging job reports and legislative developments in the US, headwinds persist. Rising US Treasury yields and the Federal Reserve’s ongoing delay in cutting interest rates contribute to a cautious environment. Still, Ethereum’s ability to hold above $2,500 suggests bullish intent. If price pushes toward and ultimately breaks above $2,700, it could trigger a broader move across altcoins, reawakening market momentum. But without a breakout in the short term, another leg of consolidation—or even a pullback—remains possible. This week may prove pivotal in setting the tone for Ethereum and the altcoin market’s next phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Downside If Resistance Holds: $2,700 Level Is Critical ETH Tests Resistance As Consolidation Tightens Ethereum is trading at $2,550, holding above its key moving averages and continuing to consolidate in a tight range. The daily chart shows that ETH is attempting to break above the 200-day moving average (red), currently sitting near $2,488, while managing to stay above both the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages. This convergence of key technical levels highlights the current equilibrium between bulls and bears. Despite multiple attempts since early May, Ethereum has not been able to sustain a breakout above the $2,700 mark. Each push higher has faced selling pressure, suggesting that this zone remains a major area of resistance. However, recent price action shows higher lows and strong defense of the $2,500 level, signaling building momentum. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low – Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Trading volume remains relatively flat, which aligns with the ongoing consolidation, but could also foreshadow a volatility spike once direction is confirmed. A successful daily close above the $2,600–$2,700 zone could trigger an impulsive move toward $3,000 and beyond. Conversely, a breakdown below the $2,480 level would invalidate the bullish structure and shift sentiment.

Ford Motor Co. announced on Tuesday that its $3B electric vehicle (EV) battery plant in Marshall, Michigan is “on track” and expected to qualify for valuable federal production tax credits, after several key revisions were made in a sweeping tax and budget bill passed by U.S. lawmakers. Ford’s EV battery plant in Michigan is back on track Ford’s Marshall facility was announced in February 2023, and is expected to create 1,700 jobs in Michigan. The plant will manufacture lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells using technology licensed from CATL, the world’s largest EV battery maker. The battery plant, now 60% complete and scheduled to begin production in 2026, had been at risk of losing federal incentives due to its partnership with Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL). Despite CATL’s critical role in global EV supply chains, its ties to China have sparked bipartisan concern in Washington. Several lawmakers have questioned whether American taxpayer dollars should support a project that uses Chinese intellectual property. Back in May, Ford warned that language in the House version of the legislation could compromise the Marshall project. The proposed provisions would have restricted production tax credits for any battery components made by certain Chinese companies or produced under a licensing agreement with them. That clause would have disqualified Ford’s use of CATL technology. But the final version of the legislation, which was passed recently, revised that language. Now, Ford says it is confident the Marshall plant will qualify for the production tax credit, which supports the domestic manufacturing of EV batteries. “This is a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness,” the company said in a statement. The new U.S. tax bill restructures EV incentives In 2023, Michigan reduced its incentive package for the project after Ford scaled back expected production volumes to align with slowing EV demand nationwide. The company cited the declining consumer interest in EVs, alongside high production costs, as reasons for its more cautious rollout. However, the new U.S. bill offers significant new benefits to automakers. In addition to preserving production tax credits for battery manufacturing, even when the technology involves Chinese partners like CATL, the law eliminates penalties for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) targets. Industry analysts have stated that while the law’s changes remove near-term obstacles for automakers, they also raise questions about the long-term strategy. “This is a necessary compromise to maintain momentum in EV manufacturing,” a policy analyst familiar with the legislation said. “But over time, the U.S. will still need to invest heavily in its own battery technology and supply chains if it wants true independence.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Raoul Pal Believes This Bullish History Will Repeat",https://timestabloid.com/69000-xrp-price-rally-on-the-cards-raoul-pal-believes-this-bullish-history-will-repeat/,"David Pal, co-founder of Real Vision, suggests that the cryptocurrency market is mirroring the behavioral pattern seen in early 2017 following Donald Trump’s first presidential inauguration. This observation may carry significant implications for XRP, especially if a repeat of that historic surge materializes. Market Stagnation Amid 2025 Political Flux Despite a strong rally across the cryptocurrency sector from November 2024 to January 2025, activity has slowed. Altcoins, including XRP, have traded sideways in recent months, while Bitcoin has set new all-time highs. This divergence has led many investors to pause and ask what comes next for the broader market and major altcoins like XRP. Pal identifies a parallel between current market dynamics and those seen during the first Trump presidency. In late 2016, following Trump’s victory, global financial markets reacted with increased volatility and a stronger U.S. dollar. A similar strengthening of the dollar occurred after Trump’s recent election, contributing to tightening financial conditions and asset price corrections in early 2025. Like in 2017, Pal notes that this recent strengthening of the dollar is likely temporary and driven by policy shifts rather than fundamental economic forces. The strategic pressure for a weaker dollar, he explains, creates a favorable environment for risk assets, particularly equities and cryptocurrencies. As the dollar softens, capital typically flows back into these markets, potentially setting the stage for renewed rallies. XRP’s 2017 Rally: A Metric for Comparison XRP exhibited a remarkable climb in early 2017. Between March and May of that year, its price rose from $0.0055 to $0.3988, a staggering 7,150% increase. A consolidation followed until December, after which XRP surged again, rising 1,517% to reach an all-time high of $3.80 in January 2018. Altogether, this cycle saw XRP appreciate nearly 69,000%. Repeating History? The token’s recent price trajectory shows striking similarities to the 2017 cycle. From November 2024 through January 2025, following Trump’s election, the token climbed from approximately $0.50 to $3.40, a 580% gain over three months. A subsequent six-month consolidation phase has ensued, mirroring the 2017 pattern. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical analysts and market strategists now forecast a forthcoming breakout phase. EGRAG Crypto, among others, suggests that if the historical pattern continues, XRP could experience a second upward wave of around 121.8%, potentially pushing its price from approximately $2.27 to $5. Some analysts even project a minimum of $6 in this next leg, with the possibility of reaching $7.80 should momentum intensify. In May, Raoul Pal himself expressed confidence about XRP’s next directional move. If XRP follows the same trajectory as the 2017 rally, continued momentum could yield significant returns. A 121.8% increase from its current price would place XRP near $5. A doubling of that move could push its valuation to nearly $8. These scenarios, while speculative, offer a clear reference point for investors monitoring XRP’s alignment with macroeconomic shifts and historical precedent. If Raoul Pal’s comparison holds, the present market structure may mark the beginning of another major altcoin rally similar to the 2017 cycle. For XRP holders, this context provides reason for optimism, but it also underscores the need for disciplined analysis, risk management, and close attention to macroeconomic indicators.

This strategic rotation toward narrative-rich, community-led projects has thrust MAGACOIN FINANCE into the spotlight — prompting serious discussions about whether it stands out as the best crypto presale to accumulate ahead of the anticipated market surge. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE is Capturing Early Investor Attention Unlike most emerging altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines the viral energy of a meme project with a sharply defined political and cultural identity. It’s this distinct positioning that has analysts and early adopters flagging it as a unique entry in the current presale landscape. Key reasons it’s gaining traction: Transparent, zero-tax tokenomics: Transactions carry no buy or sell tax, a feature designed to maximize potential upside by ensuring investor capital isn’t slowly drained by hidden fees. Decentralized governance: Holders have genuine input in the project’s direction, appealing to a growing cohort of traders who prioritize community influence over top-down control. Viral narrative: MAGACOIN FINANCE taps into both meme culture and political symbolism, setting it apart from purely speculative tokens. This narrative depth is often a driver of lasting engagement. Adding to the intrigue, the project’s early rounds have already seen overwhelming participation, with thousands of contributors securing positions well before wider awareness takes hold. Analyst Commentary: “Timing Could Be Everything” While established assets like Ethereum and XRP continue to anchor institutional portfolios — with Ethereum ETFs drawing billions in flows and Ripple eyeing a U.S. banking license — seasoned crypto analysts stress that the most dramatic multipliers often come from presales positioned just ahead of major market rotations. MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently benefiting from: Undervalued early-stage status: Its presale valuation remains a fraction of what similar projects have reached post-launch. Fast community formation: Telegram and social channels have reported robust growth, a signal that retail interest is building organically rather than via heavy marketing alone. Limited allocation windows: Each presale stage has moved quickly, reinforcing the notion that supply is tightening. Investors looking to capture pre-listing prices may find that waiting until later stages — or after an exchange debut — reduces their potential upside. Early Comparisons: Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Follow the Path of DOGE or SHIBA INU? Historically, many of the most explosive crypto success stories have shared a few common characteristics: a grassroots community, a narrative that resonates beyond mere price charts, and an accessible entry point that draws wide participation. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be aligning with that template. Its blend of humor, political messaging, and zero-tax structure invites parallels to the early momentum of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu — but with arguably clearer tokenomics and a sharper ideological theme that could drive loyalty beyond speculative cycles. The Bottom Line: A Standout Crypto Presale Ahead of a Potential Bull Run As forecasts for late 2025 continue to circle around macroeconomic catalysts and expanding institutional crypto products, the broader market may be setting the stage for renewed altcoin inflows. For investors seeking more than incremental gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a rare blend of meme-driven community, political narrative, and transparent structure — positioning it as arguably the best crypto presale to consider before broader capital rotations accelerate. Early participants could be securing a foothold well before major listings amplify demand — making now a strategic moment to evaluate where this project fits in a diversified crypto portfolio.

The Russian state-run news agency TASS reported that the press service of the diplomatic mission confirmed it had sent the department a formal request. The service said the embassy was “closely monitoring the situation around Dmitry Vasiliev.” It noted that Polish courts extradited the Russian citizen at the request of the US authorities.” A spokesperson said: “We have requested that information about Vasiliev’s location, health condition, and procedural status of Vasiliev be provided as soon as possible.” Russian Embassy: We Want Updates on Vasiliev The service also demanded that Russian consular officers be allowed to meet with Vasiliev under the terms of the 1964 Bilateral Consular Convention. Vasiliev and others set up WEX as a successor to the BTC-e exchange. It ceased trading in 2018. The closure left scores of customers unable to access fiat and coins worth almost $0.5 billion. The embassy said that once it receives information about Vasiliev, it would “immediately contact him and provide him with the necessary consular and legal assistance.” The Russian Embassy in Washington DC in 2020. (Source: Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs [CC BY 4.0]) Vasiliev’s legal team at the European Court of Human Rights last month told Russian reporters that Polish officials had deported their client from Warsaw in 2024. At the time, Vasiliev was wanted in the United States. Prosecutors say he masterminded a criminal fraud and money laundering network. The lawyers said that Vasiliev was extradited to the US “as part of a criminal case involving [the former BTC-e finance chief] Alexander Vinnik.” US prosecutors accused Vinnik of laundering $4 billion to $9 billion through the now-defunct BTC-e crypto exchange. Greek police arrested him in 2017. A court then extradited him to the US in August 2022. In February this year, Vinnik was freed in a prisoner swap with the American teacher Marc Fogel.

In a recent post on X, Rothschild stated that the digital asset must first break through specific benchmarks, namely $7 and $13 before any serious momentum toward the $36 level can be expected. Rothschild’s projection has reignited long-standing discussions about XRP’s growth potential. Critics often push back on high price targets, citing the substantial increase required for such outcomes. At its current trading price near $2.27, XRP would need to rally over 1,500% to reach $36. If XRP were to reach that level, its market capitalization would exceed $2.1 trillion, similar to Bitcoin’s current valuation. Such a scenario would position XRP above major global assets like silver and corporations, including Facebook and Saudi Aramco. Skeptics argue that achieving this valuation in the short term is unlikely due to broader market limitations and regulatory uncertainty. 36$ for XRP is not unrealistic, but first 7-13$ — Nathaniel C. J. Rothschild (@NCJRothschild) July 5, 2025 Timeline Estimates from Analysts Various forecasting models offer different timelines for XRP potentially reaching or approaching the $36 threshold. Research published by Telegaon projects that this price may be achievable by the year 2030, assuming favorable market conditions and adoption trends. Bitwise, in a separate analysis targeted at institutional investors, proposed a slightly lower target of $29 by 2030 in an ultra-bullish scenario. Their more conservative short-term outlook sees XRP potentially hitting $6.53 under optimal conditions in 2025 or 2026 but also considers the possibility of a price retracement to around $1.07. Changelly, another market research platform, adopts an even longer horizon, estimating that XRP could reach $36 sometime in 2032. These projections vary based on the assumptions behind each model, including market adoption, institutional investment, and technological developments within the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Views from Independent Analysts Despite the conservative nature of institutional forecasts, independent market watchers maintain a more optimistic stance. Analyst Dustin Layton recently predicted that XRP could reach at least $50 before the end of this year, challenging the broader crypto community to reexamine their expectations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Similarly, EGRAG Crypto, known for his historical pattern-based analysis, suggested that XRP could experience a price surge of up to 2,000%, bringing the token above $37 if its previous market cycles repeat. However, he also acknowledged that a more moderate scenario could see XRP peak around $9 if momentum falls short. Community Reactions Remain Divided Rothschild’s comments sparked a mixed response from the online XRP community. Some users expressed enthusiasm, arguing that in the world of cryptocurrency, such targets are attainable over time. One commenter described $36 as cheap, implying that even higher valuations could be possible. On the other hand, some urged caution , stressing the need to focus on nearer-term targets and arguing that projections of major price increases should be based on present market performance. While opinions differ widely on whether XRP can realistically attain a $36 price point, consensus exists around the need for the asset to achieve interim price milestones first.

A Founding Architect of XRP Ledger Arthur Britto was instrumental in the creation of Ripple Labs in 2012, alongside David Schwartz, Chris Larsen, and Jed McCaleb. In collaboration with his co-founders, Britto helped establish the XRP Ledger “as a next-generation payment solution for scalability and transaction efficiency,” according to crypto historians. His technical expertise shaped XRP into one of the most prominent digital assets by market capitalization. Despite these contributions, Britto has intentionally kept a low profile. Unlike Schwartz and McCaleb, who have participated in interviews and public forums, Britto has avoided media exposure and rarely communicates publicly. HE CO-CREATED THE XRP LEDGER. HE HOLDS 2% OF ALL XRP. HE’S NEVER BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC. Arthur Britto might be the most important figure in crypto you’ve never heard of. Let’s dive into the mystery. pic.twitter.com/xKyiYXIpGY — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) July 5, 2025 His influence extends beyond his engineering contributions. A contractual arrangement from 2012 granted him ownership of approximately 2% of all XRP tokens. This sizable holding underscores both his foundational role in the project and his long-term commitment to XRP’s development. Comparisons to Satoshi Nakamoto Britto’s extreme privacy has fueled speculation and intrigue within the community. Some observers have drawn parallels to Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto . The coincidence that Britto’s last public interaction occurred during the initial XRP Ledger launch has added fuel to these theories. However, there is no credible indication that Britto is Nakamoto, and this notion remains speculative. In June 2025, Britto broke his decade-long silence by posting a single emoji on X. That post was confirmed by Ripple CTO David Schwartz, highlighting its authenticity. Although the meaning behind the emoji remains unclear, it generated speculation that it may indicate forthcoming developments within the ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ongoing Influence Through Blockchain Technology Although Britto maintains a low public presence, his engagement with blockchain technology continues. He is a co-founder of PolySign, a company focused on secure digital asset custody. PolySign evolved into Standard Custody & Trust Company and was subsequently integrated into Ripple’s custody services. These developments suggest that Britto’s influence extends beyond XRP Ledger protocol design and into institutional infrastructure for digital assets. Within XRP communities, rumors have circulated that Britto has predicted XRP could ultimately reach $10,000 per token. While intriguing, there is no confirmed statement or credible source supporting this claim. Although Arthur Britto rarely seeks attention, his technical contributions and token ownership establish him as a key contributor to Ripple’s foundation. He continues to drive blockchain innovation quietly, both through XRPL and institutional-grade custody services. While the full extent of his role remains undisclosed, analysts agree that Britto’s work continues to influence the strategic trajectory of XRP and Ripple.

Alden explains in a new analysis that people with specific payment issues like capital controls and payment de-platforming find BTC useful, but they can often also use less-volatile stablecoins as short-term solutions to those same problems. “There are some very well-meaning Bitcoin proponents trying to convince Bitcoin holders to spend it more. I don’t particularly view that as a sustainable practice. Bitcoin is not going to catch on as a charity. In order for spending it to catch on persistently at scale (i.e. not just billions of dollar-equivalents in annual global medium-of-exchange volume, but trillions), it has to solve problems for spenders and/or recipients that other solutions are not doing. And at this stage of adoption, that’s not necessarily the case, especially with capital gains taxes applicable to every single transaction and with options like stablecoins for near-term spending needs where volatility needs to be low.” Alden says Bitcoin instead has value due to its “optionality.” “Owning a sound, liquid, fungible, portable store of value that is going through its adoption phase gives the owner some perks, or options, that other assets do not. Mainly, they can bring their store of value wherever they want in the world without relying on central counterparties and credit. It also allows them to make crossborder payments, including to deplatformed recipients, through substantial friction even if they are staying put where they are. They might not be able to ubiquitously pay with it, but if need be they can find ways to convert it to local currency in most environments that they find themselves in, and in some cases can indeed pay with it directly.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

After months of uncertainty and price consolidation, a new analysis suggests that altcoins have just reclaimed a critical trendline—the same one that marked the beginning of the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. With market patterns aligning and fractals emerging, analysts are now questioning whether the conditions are once again ripe for a massive altcoin breakout. Altcoins Eye Vertical Move As Bear Trap Ends The altcoin market may be on the brink of a historic breakout, according to a recent chart analysis by crypto expert Merlijn The Trader. The analyst draws parallels between the current cycle and those of 2017 and 2021. The analyst’s chart, published on X social media, shows that the total altcoin market capitalization has reclaimed a long-term ascending trendline that had preceded previous vertical expansions during major bull runs. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says In earlier cycles, altcoins briefly broke this trendline in what was identified as a “bear trap” before swiftly reversing and launching into explosive growth phases. Merlijin The Trader reveals that this pattern appears to be repeating in this cycle, as the current market structure mirrors previous setups that triggered rapid valuation increases across the altcoin sector. The ascending trendline recovery is framed within a red box in the chart, consistent with the zones that marked the end of prior downtrends. In each instance, the reclaim was followed by aggressive upward movement, highlighted by green boxes that represented parabolic gains in the total market cap. Merlijn The Trader suggests that the recent rebound indicates the completion of another bear trap, signaling renewed bullish momentum. Green arrows placed below the price curve, matching the timing of previous breakouts within the analyst’s chart, imply that the altcoin market could be preparing for another phase of expansion. If the historical fractal holds, the analyst forecasts a sharp vertical rally for altcoins, with valuations possibly reaching the $10-$16 trillion range. Altcoin Market Mirror 2016-2018 Breakout Setup In another fresh analysis, Merlijn The Trader noted that the altcoin market cap is showing signs of repeating a historical pattern that previously led to a major bull rally. A comparison between the 2016-2018 market cycle and the current one reveals an almost identical structure playing out, albeit on a much larger scale.

This same fractal unfolded before the explosive altcoin rally in 2017. The analyst’s chart also illustrates that in the previous cycle, altcoins broke out of this same wedge pattern, resulting in a massive surge in market capitalization, which he referred to as “Pump 2.0”. With the same breakout now confirmed for this cycle’s market structure, Merlijn The Trader predicts that the altcoin sector may be entering its next parabolic expansion phase. This development could mark the end of the altcoin market’s current bear phase and the beginning of a second macro pump similar to what occurred between 2017 and early 2018.

According to multiple experts, Dogecoin, SHIBA INU, and MAGACOIN FINANCE now rank among the top meme coins to buy for investors looking to catch the next big run. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Altcoin Movement Gaining Serious Momentum Launched as a decentralized political memecoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly transformed into one of the most talked-about projects in the crypto space. It blends meme energy with cultural relevance, echoing the “Make America Great Again” movement while promoting a zero-tax model and full community control. But MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just riding a narrative — it’s backed by smart tokenomics and serious traction. The project is fully audited by HashEx, and the presale has already drawn thousands of investors. Multiple presale stages have sold out quickly, and the buzz across forums and Telegram groups suggests that entry points are closing fast. Analysts compare its rise to early Dogecoin and SHIBA INU — but highlight that MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a capped supply, no tax, and a more ideologically aligned, community-first approach. In a meme coin market often dominated by hype alone, this structure is giving MAGACOIN FINANCE a unique edge. With rumors of major exchange listings and expanding media coverage, many believe it could become the top-performing meme-powered altcoin in the months ahead. For early investors, the current phase presents a limited-time opportunity to get in before the next wave of demand hits. Dogecoin: The Original Meme King Holds Strong Dogecoin needs no introduction. As the original meme coin, it remains a symbol of community strength and viral market movements. While it has already seen explosive growth in previous cycles, analysts still rank DOGE as a long-term meme asset with potential for future rallies — especially if broader adoption picks up or Elon Musk reaffirms his support. Though Dogecoin’s growth story is well-documented, it now serves as a blueprint for spotting the next Doge-like run — which is exactly what experts see brewing in MAGACOIN FINANCE. SHIBA INU: A DeFi-Enabled Meme Ecosystem with Long-Term Potential SHIBA INU has come a long way from its meme beginnings. With its own decentralized exchange, token burns, and developer updates, SHIB has built out a full ecosystem. Experts still view SHIBA INU as one of the top meme coins with staying power, particularly given its community loyalty and growing utility. However, its massive supply and slower price movement have led some investors to explore earlier-stage opportunities with higher upside potential — like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is still in its foundational growth phase. Final Thoughts: Why Experts Are Focusing on MAGACOIN FINANCE Dogecoin and SHIBA INU may have started the meme coin wave, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping the future . With a politically charged brand, fixed tokenomics, a zero-tax model, and a fast-growing base of holders, it represents the next evolution of the meme coin movement . Analysts say the timing is perfect. Momentum is building, investor entry is still early, and the opportunity to ride a high-reward asset before listings go live is narrowing quickly.

The news triggered a 5% price jump for the meme coin during Sunday trading in what appeared to be a buy-the-news event. A Shibarium-based launchpad continues the project pivot away from its speculative origins by building an ecosystem anchored in real utility and fundamentals. $LC x $SHIB x DegenSafe — the real alliance. This is just the beginning. The launchpad wars are getting serious. https://t.co/gJ7mCuBLeA https://t.co/03U1RycU8i pic.twitter.com/s50bAU1SAs — Degensafe.fun (@degensafefun) July 7, 2025 “From meme coins to mechanics, we’re reshaping what Web3 can be. DegenSafe is only the beginning,” Shiba Inu posted on X . The partnership could attract fresh retail liquidity into Shiba Inu, following the success of LetsBONK.fun —the first Solana meme coin launchpad to flip Pump.fun in volume. This may signal the start of a new meme coin trend, as speculative traders increasingly seek protection from the rug pulls, snipers, and bots that have become synonymous with Pump.fun. That said, Shiba Inu faces tough competition, lacking Solana’s high performance and ultra-low gas fees—a core contributor to the rise of platforms like LetsBONK and Pump.fun. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Could Adoption Push a Surge? If DegenSafe sees adoption similar to Solana-based meme coin launchpads, it could give Shiba Inu the fuel it needs to break free from its 6-month consolidation range. SHIB / USDT 3-day chart, double bottom pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. With its latest bounce from the lower support of the consolidation zone around $0.00001, the emergence of a double bottom pattern could see SHIB retest the $0.0000177 upper resistance. The MACD line is en route to surpass the signal line in a golden cross—the first since the Shiba Inu price last tested $0.0000177 in mid-May, suggesting a short-term uptrend may be forming. However, the RSI highlights a lack of conviction from buyers. Despite an uptrend signaling accumulation, it remains stuck below the neutral line, currently hovering in the low 40s. A fundamental catalyst like the DegenSafe launchpad could bring the adoption and fresh liquidity SHIB needs as the utility token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. If the double bottom breakout plays out, SHIB could see a 112% surge, targeting a higher resistance zone stretching back to early January at $0.000025. However, its full potential hinges on a successful break above its neckline—the $0.0000177 resistance of the consolidation zone. Before then, Immediate resistance at $0.000012 is the key level to watch—failure to break it risks a rejection and a 12% drop back to $0.00001, which would invalidate the pattern. Shiba Inu Has Lost Its Roots – The New Purest Meme Coin Could Take Its Place With Shiba Inu’s shift from pure speculation to real utility and fundamentals, it’s now the one creating the speculative plays. The truth is, SHIB has faded into the background for months as traders chased fresher narratives—on the speculative meme coin scene, attention is the fuel that drives price moves. Few stand to capitalize on this momentum as much as “mission coins”—the purest form of meme coin, fueled purely by a devoted community. We are at a pivot point. Dozens more launchpads will come. Millions of gamble coins will come and go. But only a handful of MISSION COINS will WIN. pic.twitter.com/rxsVfeux8A — Murad (@MustStopMurad) July 8, 2025 Token6900 ($T6900) is the latest chapter in that saga: no promises, no utility—because you are the utility.

Unsealed in the District of Puerto Rico, the indictment accuses Michael Shannon Sims, 48, of Georgia and Florida, and Juan Carlos Reynoso, 57, of New Jersey and Florida, of operating and promoting OmegaPro. This global crypto-based multi-level marketing operation promised investors up to 300% returns over 16 months through foreign exchange trading. “This case exposes the ruthless reality of modern financial crime,” said Guy Ficco, Chief of Criminal Investigations at the Internal Revenue Service. “OmegaPro promised financial freedom but delivered financial ruin.” Between 2019 and 2023, Sims, Reynoso, and other co-conspirators allegedly convinced thousands of victims worldwide to purchase crypto-based “investment packages,” falsely claiming the funds would be safely managed by elite forex traders, according to the Department of Justice. Prosecutors say the pair flaunted their lavish lifestyles online and hosted glitzy events to build investor trust — including one in Dubai where the OmegaPro logo was projected onto the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest skyscraper. A video posted on the company’s LinkedIn page shows attendees dressed in formal attire celebrating under the spectacle. The case underscores ongoing federal efforts to crack down on crypto fraud and multi-level marketing abuses in the digital asset space. Authorities say OmegaPro was a pyramid-style fraud disguised as a legitimate investment opportunity. After the firm claimed to have been hacked, the defendants told victims their funds had been moved to a new platform called Broker Group, according to the Department of Justice. However, users could never withdraw their money from OmegaPro or Broker Group. Sims and Reynoso now face charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, each carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The multiagency investigation was led by the Justice Department, FBI, IRS-Criminal Investigation, and Homeland Security Investigations, with assistance from international law enforcement partners. Cold-call crypto conmen jailed for $2M fraud in UK crackdown In another case, UK authorities have sentenced two men to prison for orchestrating a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme that targeted 65 victims through cold calls. Raymondip Bedi and Patrick Mavanga posed as representatives of fake crypto consultancy firms, convincing individuals to invest in bogus ventures. Judge Martin Griffiths at Southwark Crown Court said the duo “conspired to drive a coach and horses through the regulatory system.” Operating between 2017 and 2019 under company names like CCX Capital and Astaria Group LLP, the pair defrauded victims of approximately $2.03 million (£1.5 million). Both Bedi and Mavanga pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including fraud, money laundering, and possessing false identification documents. Mavanga also received a separate conviction for perverting the course of justice after he was found to have deleted phone recordings linked to the scheme. Elliptic unveils key tools to help compliance teams combat $9.3B crypto scam surge Scams have rapidly become one of the most lucrative forms of illicit activity in the crypto space.

For years, investors and enthusiasts have dreamed of easier, regulated access to digital assets through traditional investment vehicles. Now, a significant step has been taken that could bring an XRP ETF closer to reality, sparking both excitement and a healthy dose of caution. What’s the Buzz Around the XRP ETF ? The recent news that ProShares XRP ‘s Ultra XRP ETF has been registered with The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) under the ticker “UXRP” has sent ripples through the crypto community. This isn’t just any registration; it signals a formal entry into the plumbing of traditional finance, making it a pivotal moment for those eyeing a regulated XRP ETF . What is the DTCC? The DTCC is a vital piece of infrastructure in the financial markets. It provides clearing, settlement, and information services for equities, corporate and municipal bonds, unit investment trusts, government and mortgage-backed securities, money market instruments, and over-the-counter derivatives. Essentially, it’s where securities are processed and settled. Why is this significant? Registration with the DTCC means the security has a CUSIP number, making it identifiable and tradable within the traditional financial system. It’s a prerequisite for any security that aims to be listed on major exchanges. What it isn’t: Crucially, as the initial report highlighted, this DTCC registration is entirely independent of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) review process. It does not guarantee listing or approval from the SEC. Think of it as getting a passport for a foreign country – you have the document, but you still need a visa (SEC approval) to enter and stay. ProShares XRP ‘s Strategic Play: Understanding the UXRP Offering ProShares is no stranger to the cryptocurrency ETF space, having been a pioneer with the first Bitcoin futures ETF. Their move to register an Ultra XRP ETF speaks volumes about their strategy and belief in the market’s demand for such products. Who is ProShares? ProShares is a leading provider of ETFs, known for offering a diverse range of products, including leveraged and inverse ETFs. Their expertise lies in structuring financial products that allow investors to gain exposure to various asset classes in a regulated environment. What is an “Ultra” ETF? The “Ultra” designation, combined with the “2x leveraged” detail, means this ETF aims to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP. If XRP goes up 1%, the ETF aims to go up 2%. Conversely, if XRP drops 1%, the ETF aims to drop 2%. This amplification of returns (and losses) makes it a high-risk, high-reward product, typically suited for sophisticated investors or short-term trading strategies. Why a leveraged cryptocurrency ETF ? Offering a leveraged product signals confidence in XRP’s potential for significant price movements. It also caters to a segment of the market looking to amplify their exposure without directly holding the underlying asset or engaging in complex derivatives. Decoding DTCC Registration : A Crucial Step, Not the Finish Line While the DTCC registration is a necessary step in the lifecycle of any publicly traded security, it’s essential to understand its specific role and limitations in the context of a cryptocurrency ETF . The DTCC’s Role: The DTCC acts as a central clearinghouse and depository. Its registration process primarily ensures that a security meets the operational and technical requirements for trading and settlement within the traditional financial system. It’s about infrastructure and plumbing, not about regulatory approval of the underlying asset or the investment vehicle’s suitability for public investors. Independence from SEC: This is the critical distinction. The DTCC does not evaluate the investment merits of a security or its compliance with securities laws. That falls squarely within the purview of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC’s mandate is investor protection, market integrity, and capital formation. What’s Next After DTCC Registration ? For the Ultra XRP ETF to become truly accessible to the public, it must still navigate the SEC’s rigorous review process. This involves filing an S-1 registration statement (or similar) and addressing any concerns the SEC might have regarding investor protection, market manipulation, custody, and valuation of the underlying digital asset. The Road Ahead: Navigating SEC Approval for Cryptocurrency ETF s The path to SEC approval for any cryptocurrency ETF , especially one directly tracking a digital asset like XRP, has historically been fraught with challenges. The SEC has long expressed concerns about market manipulation, custody, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. A History of Caution: For years, the SEC resisted approving spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns that the underlying market was susceptible to manipulation and that adequate investor protections were not in place. It wasn’t until January 2024 that the first spot Bitcoin ETFs were finally approved, following extensive efforts by applicants to address these concerns. The Ripple vs. SEC Factor: XRP’s unique situation, stemming from the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the SEC regarding whether XRP is an unregistered security, adds another layer of complexity. While a U.S. court ruled that XRP itself is not a security when sold to the general public on exchanges, the SEC continues its case regarding institutional sales. The clarity (or lack thereof) on XRP’s regulatory status is a significant hurdle for an XRP ETF . Leveraged ETF Scrutiny: Beyond the asset itself, a 2x leveraged ETF faces additional scrutiny. Leveraged products are inherently more complex and carry higher risks, making the SEC particularly cautious about their accessibility to retail investors. Key Considerations for SEC: Market Surveillance: Can the ETF issuer demonstrate sufficient surveillance-sharing agreements to prevent market manipulation? Custody: How will the underlying XRP be securely held and audited? Valuation: How will the ETF accurately price XRP in a volatile market? Investor Protection: Are the risks of a leveraged crypto product adequately disclosed and understood by potential investors? What This Means for Investors and the Broader Crypto Market The registration of ProShares’ Ultra XRP ETF with the DTCC, while not final approval, signifies growing institutional interest and infrastructure development around digital assets. Potential Benefits for Investors: Accessibility: If approved, an XRP ETF would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP through regulated brokerage accounts, without needing to navigate crypto exchanges, wallets, or private keys. Diversification: It offers another avenue for portfolio diversification within the digital asset space. Liquidity: ETFs are typically highly liquid, offering ease of entry and exit. Leveraged Exposure: For those with a high-risk tolerance and a bullish outlook, the 2x leverage offers amplified returns. Challenges and Risks: Volatility: XRP, like all cryptocurrencies, is highly volatile. A leveraged ETF amplifies this volatility, leading to potentially significant losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: The ongoing SEC lawsuit and general regulatory ambiguity surrounding crypto remain major risks. Tracking Error: Leveraged ETFs are designed to achieve their stated objectives over a single day. Over longer periods, compounding can lead to significant deviations from the underlying asset’s performance. Fees: ETFs come with management fees, which can eat into returns. Impact on the Broader Market: The continued push for cryptocurrency ETF s, including for assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, indicates a maturing market and increasing institutional comfort. Each step towards traditional finance integration can pave the way for broader adoption and legitimacy for the entire crypto ecosystem. It also highlights the growing demand from investors for regulated crypto investment products. Actionable Insights: For investors watching this space, here are some key takeaways: Stay Informed: Follow SEC filings and announcements closely. The S-1 filing, when it comes, will offer critical details. Understand the Product: A 2x leveraged ETF is not for everyone. Ensure you fully grasp the risks before considering investment. Monitor Regulatory Landscape: The outcome of the Ripple vs. SEC case will have significant implications for XRP’s future and the likelihood of an ETF. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially in a volatile market. Conclusion: ProShares’ registration of its Ultra XRP ETF with the DTCC marks a notable, albeit preliminary, stride towards mainstream financial integration for XRP. It underscores the persistent demand for regulated crypto investment products and ProShares’ continued pioneering role in this arena. While the DTCC registration is a crucial operational milestone, the ultimate hurdle remains the stringent review and potential SEC approval . The journey for an XRP ETF is far from over, filled with regulatory complexities and market dynamics. However, each step forward, like this DTCC registration , fuels optimism for the future of crypto in traditional finance, signaling a slow but steady march towards broader acceptance and accessibility for digital assets. The coming months will be critical in determining if this bold move by ProShares XRP truly unlocks new possibilities for investors seeking exposure to XRP.

Companies often streamline operations to dedicate more bandwidth to core projects they believe will drive future growth and innovation. What is the EigenLayer Protocol, and Why is it Important? Before diving into EigenCloud, it’s essential to understand the foundation Eigen Labs has built: the EigenLayer protocol . EigenLayer is a groundbreaking restaking primitive on Ethereum, designed to extend Ethereum’s security to other decentralized applications (dApps) and middleware services. It allows staked ETH to be ‘restaked’ to secure additional networks, effectively creating a shared security layer. This mechanism offers several compelling benefits: Enhanced Security: By leveraging Ethereum’s massive staked capital, EigenLayer can provide robust security guarantees to new protocols without requiring them to bootstrap their own validator sets. Capital Efficiency: Stakers can earn additional yield by restaking their ETH, making their capital more productive. Innovation Hub: It enables a new wave of ‘Actively Validated Services’ (AVSs) – decentralized applications that rely on EigenLayer for their security, fostering rapid innovation in the blockchain space. The EigenLayer protocol has garnered immense attention and capital, becoming one of the most significant innovations in the Ethereum ecosystem. Its success underscores Eigen Labs’ capability to develop complex, impactful blockchain infrastructure. Diving into EigenCloud: The Future of Decentralized Cloud Computing? With the Eigen Labs layoffs , the spotlight now firmly shines on EigenCloud . But what exactly is EigenCloud, and why is Eigen Labs committing so many resources to it? While specific details are still emerging, the vision for EigenCloud is to build a robust, decentralized cloud computing platform. Imagine a cloud service that isn’t reliant on a single corporate entity like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud, but rather operates on a distributed network, leveraging blockchain principles for security, transparency, and censorship resistance. The concept of decentralized cloud is not new, but Eigen Labs’ approach, potentially integrating with the EigenLayer restaking mechanism, could be revolutionary. Key aspects of a decentralized cloud platform often include: Distributed Infrastructure: Resources (compute, storage, bandwidth) are provided by a network of participants rather than centralized data centers. Enhanced Privacy and Security: Data is encrypted and distributed, reducing single points of failure and attack vectors. Censorship Resistance: No single entity can shut down or control access to the services. Cost Efficiency: Potentially lower costs due to peer-to-peer resource sharing and reduced overhead. If EigenCloud successfully leverages the power of restaked ETH and the decentralized validator set, it could offer a compelling alternative for developers and enterprises seeking more resilient, transparent, and secure cloud infrastructure. This strategic pivot signals Eigen Labs’ belief that decentralized cloud computing is the next frontier for blockchain technology. What Does This Mean for Crypto Industry Trends?

With multiple sold-out stages and fresh demand daily, this meme-powered political altcoin is moving up the charts as a top analyst pick. Thousands of investors are lining up for MAGACOIN FINANCE as it continues to attract high-volume buyers. While XRP’s banking push has kept it in headlines, traders looking for early-stage growth are calling MAGACOIN FINANCE the next big play before wider listings hit the market. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming a Top Meme-Driven Altcoin MAGACOIN FINANCE is more than another meme coin. It’s positioning itself as a decentralized political altcoin with real traction. Its fixed supply of 170 billion tokens creates scarcity that smart traders look for in a breakout project. The contract is fully audited by Hashex, boosting trust for new investors. Earlier rounds sold out fast, and the latest stage is already seeing slots vanish every few hours. This zero-tax model makes it attractive for clean trades, while community control gives holders a voice in future decisions. It’s no surprise analysts are now comparing early MAGACOIN FINANCE momentum to the first days of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. By tapping into cultural and political themes, this project is drawing interest from retail buyers and large crypto funds alike. Many see it as one of the few coins blending meme power with real ideological energy. This is why MAGACOIN FINANCE is repeatedly ranked as a top meme altcoin for Q3 2025. MAGACOIN’s Growing Momentum and Limited Availability The urgency around MAGACOIN FINANCE is clear. Demand keeps pushing new price levels higher. Available slots in each stage are selling out rapidly, creating fear of missing out for traders who want in before bigger exchanges list the token. Market sentiment is now grouping MAGACOIN FINANCE with heavyweights like XRP and Ethereum on watchlists. This shows just how strong the narrative is. Unlike many meme coins, this one stands out for its focus on decentralization and anti-centralization stance. Crypto insiders say MAGACOIN FINANCE is still early, which means the biggest moves could come as the community grows. XRP Price Targets Still Climbing XRP is enjoying a fresh wave of interest as Ripple’s long court battle with the SEC nears the finish line. With regulatory clarity in sight, institutional players are watching closely. Ripple’s move to secure a national banking charter and a Federal Reserve master account could push XRP deeper into the regulated finance space. Analysts expect XRP to trade between $2.32 and $2.80 in Q3 if it breaks above key resistance levels. Some see a possible rally to $6.50–$8 or even $10 if ETF speculation heats up and banking moves deliver results. These factors keep XRP on the radar for traders seeking stable growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE Ranks as the Better Q3 Play While XRP holds strong appeal for institutional growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is winning trader attention as the best crypto to buy for big Q3 upside. With its capped supply, massive analyst support, and fast-selling stages, it offers an early position that XRP can’t match right now. Thousands of investors already see MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next top meme coin with real political and cultural staying power. Analysts also project a potential to jump 30x by the end of 2025. Demand is moving fast, and slots keep filling. Those looking for the next breakout altcoin won’t want to miss this chance.

This latest call, highlighted by the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, reignites a long-standing debate about the independence of the central bank and the direction of U.S. economic policy . For those navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency, understanding these macroeconomic pressures is crucial, as Fed decisions often ripple across all asset classes, including digital currencies. Why is Trump Pushing for Rate Cuts from the Trump Fed ? Donald Trump’s consistent advocacy for lower interest rates stems from a belief that such a move would stimulate economic growth, boost the stock market, and make borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. His latest comments on Truth Social underscore a recurring theme from his presidency: a desire for the Federal Reserve to adopt a more accommodative monetary stance. During his time in office, Trump frequently criticized Powell for not cutting rates aggressively enough, arguing that higher rates were hindering the U.S. economy’s full potential. The argument for rate cuts often centers on several key points: Stimulating Growth: Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses, encouraging investment, expansion, and job creation. For consumers, it means cheaper mortgages and loan payments, potentially boosting spending. Combating Deflationary Pressures: In an environment where prices are falling or stagnating, rate cuts can help prevent deflation, which can be detrimental to an economy. Weakening the Dollar: Lower rates can make a country’s currency less attractive to foreign investors, potentially leading to a weaker dollar. This can make exports cheaper and more competitive, benefiting domestic industries. Market Boost: Historically, lower rates have often been associated with rising stock markets, as companies’ borrowing costs decrease and future earnings become more valuable. The Federal Reserve’s Independent Stance and Jerome Powell ‘s Dilemma At the heart of this discussion is the Federal Reserve’s role as an independent central bank. The Fed operates with a dual mandate from Congress: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability (low and stable inflation). This independence is designed to insulate monetary policy decisions from short-term political pressures, allowing the Fed to make choices based on economic data and long-term stability goals. Jerome Powell , as the current Chairman, has repeatedly emphasized the Fed’s commitment to its dual mandate and its data-dependent approach. His decisions are not made in isolation but are the result of deliberations by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which assesses a wide range of economic indicators, including: Inflation rates (Consumer Price Index, Personal Consumption Expenditures) Employment data (unemployment rate, job growth, wage growth) GDP growth Consumer spending and business investment Global economic conditions The challenge for Powell and the Fed is balancing the desire for economic growth with the need to control inflation. Cutting rates too soon or too aggressively could reignite inflationary pressures, eroding purchasing power and creating economic instability. Conversely, holding rates too high for too long could stifle economic activity and lead to a recession. The Ripple Effect: How Interest Rate Cuts Impact Markets, Including Crypto Monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve have profound effects across all financial markets. When the Fed signals or implements interest rate cuts , several dynamics come into play: Market Type Potential Impact of Rate Cuts Explanation Traditional Stocks (Equities) Generally Positive Lower borrowing costs for companies, higher corporate profits, and increased investor appetite for riskier assets over bonds. Bonds (Fixed Income) Yields Fall, Prices Rise Existing bonds with higher yields become more attractive. New bonds will be issued at lower yields. Real Estate Generally Positive Lower mortgage rates make homeownership more affordable, boosting demand and property values. Commodities (e.g., Gold) Mixed, Often Positive A weaker dollar (often a result of lower rates) makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for foreign buyers. Gold can also act as an inflation hedge if rate cuts lead to inflation. Cryptocurrencies Often Positive (Risk-On) Lower interest rates can reduce the attractiveness of traditional safe-haven assets and yield-bearing instruments, pushing investors towards higher-risk, higher-reward assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Increased liquidity in the system can also flow into crypto. For the crypto market, a ‘risk-on’ environment, often fostered by lower rates and abundant liquidity, tends to be beneficial. When traditional investments offer lower returns, the allure of potentially higher gains in digital assets increases. Conversely, a ‘risk-off’ environment, driven by high rates or economic uncertainty, can lead investors to pull funds from speculative assets like crypto. The Broader Implications of Trump’s Stance on Economic Policy Trump’s repeated public demands on the Fed highlight a fundamental tension between political leadership and central bank independence. While politicians often prefer policies that can stimulate short-term growth and appease voters, central bankers are tasked with maintaining long-term economic stability, which sometimes requires unpopular decisions. The former President’s use of Truth Social as a direct communication channel amplifies his message, ensuring it reaches a wide audience and keeps the pressure on policymakers. This dynamic creates uncertainty for markets. Investors constantly weigh the potential for political influence on monetary policy against the Fed’s stated commitment to independence. Any perceived shift in the Fed’s stance due to external pressure could lead to market volatility, as participants adjust their expectations for future interest rate decisions. What to Watch For: Navigating Future Fed Decisions As the debate around interest rates continues, market participants, including crypto investors, should pay close attention to several key indicators and announcements: FOMC Meetings: The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times a year to discuss and set monetary policy. The statements and press conferences following these meetings provide crucial insights into the Fed’s outlook. Inflation Data: Key inflation reports like the CPI (Consumer Price Index) and PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) are primary drivers of Fed decisions. Sustained declines in inflation could pave the way for cuts. Employment Reports: The monthly jobs report (Non-Farm Payrolls, unemployment rate) offers a snapshot of the labor market, a key component of the Fed’s dual mandate. Speeches by Fed Officials: Public comments from Jerome Powell and other Fed governors can offer hints about future policy direction. Understanding these signals can help investors anticipate potential shifts in the macroeconomic landscape and position their portfolios accordingly, whether in traditional assets or the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: The Enduring Battle Over Interest Rates Donald Trump’s latest call for interest rate cuts from Jerome Powell via Truth Social is more than just a political statement; it’s a stark reminder of the ongoing tension between political aspirations and the independent mandate of the Federal Reserve. While Trump advocates for policies he believes will accelerate economic growth, the Fed remains committed to balancing employment and price stability through its carefully considered economic policy . For investors, particularly those in the crypto space, these macroeconomic currents are vital. The Fed’s decisions on rates directly influence liquidity, risk appetite, and the broader financial environment, shaping the trajectory of digital assets. As this high-stakes economic dialogue continues, staying informed about the Fed’s actions and the rationale behind them will be paramount for navigating the markets successfully.

This new feature could completely change how people trade crypto derivatives by making them simpler and more accessible. Perpetual futures now see more than $100 billion in trading volume daily. That said, most of the platforms that offer these products have been centralized exchanges, which are overloaded with complex charts, order books, and technical tools, which can be off-putting for non-professional users. Phantom is trying to democratize this kind of trading. Instead of forcing users to shift assets between platforms or learn about trading abstractions, Phantom allows them to trade perpetual futures without ever leaving their wallets. They also simplified the entire process, deposit with SOL, and let the wallet swap to USDC automatically. From the next screen, they select a market and pick their desired leverage. No complex user interfaces or any financial jargon. The platform’s experience is sleek and mobile-friendly so that users can open leveraged positions as effortlessly as they handle NFTs or make a token swap. No other Crypto wallet goes this simple. Phantom can onboard millions of new users locked out of the derivatives market by building this high-level trading functionality into its user interface. Phantom taps Hyperliquid to bring fast, gas-free perpetual to everyday traders Phantom’s latest perpetual futures have been built on Hyperliquid , a rapidly scaling Layer 2 decentralized trade protocol with high-speed infrastructure and zero gas fees. Thanks to this integration, Phantom users can now trade across over 100 diverse markets in the same app they already use to manage their tokens and NFTs. They cover all major markets, including BTC, ETH, and SOL, as well as emerging altcoins such as AVAX, ARB, and LINK. The system even holds high-volatility meme coins like Dogecoin, Pepe, and Bonk, leaving traders with plenty of choice if they want to take a risk on high-risk speculation. So, Hyperliquid deals with the nitty and gritty, like order execution and risk management, and Phantom is the beautiful and user-friendly interface. The result is a complete trading tool that can get anyone hands-on with advanced trading tools. Phantom suggested this is just the start in a blog post discussing the news. The team hopes to expand the feature set, adding more educational tools and social features to help make derivatives trading more accessible and engaging for beginners. Phantom’s Futures feature sparks debate on risk and accessibility Phantom’s innovation is well-received among the crypto community but is also a cause for concern. Perpetual futures are high-risk financial products. They enable traders to raise the stakes but also the risk of losses. A bad trade at 40x leverage may end quickly and suddenly, liquidating, especially if markets are turbulent. Professional traders have tools for managing risk, stopping losses, hedge strategies, and complex data analyses that protect them. Casual users often don’t. By putting derivatives just a few taps away, Phantom might also bring these risks to a new generation of unprepared users. Its critics say that ease of access could encourage reckless trading, especially among younger or novice investors. The Phantom team still stresses responsible use. The platform features warnings, educational pop-ups, and even an explicit disclaimer before a user can open a futures position. The feature is also opt-in, so you must consent to the risks before taking advantage of it. And Phantom’s ambitious move amounts to a litmus test for whether retailers will adopt crypto derivatives. It’s a sign that wallets can’t simply be repositories anymore; they are evolving into full-blown financial ecosystems. If successful, this move could change the purpose of self-custody wallets, transforming them into potential primary investments and eventually, trading and earning platforms. In the wrong hands, it could leave a generation of over-leveraged, under-informed users tangled in the volatility of crypto markets.

A recent announcement from the U.S. Treasury Department serves as a stark reminder of this reality, highlighting the persistent threat posed by state-sponsored cyber criminals. This time, the focus is squarely on North Korea and its audacious attempts to fund its illicit programs through digital means. US Sanctions North Korea: A Direct Response to Digital Threats In a significant move to counter global cybercrime and illicit finance, the U.S. Treasury has taken decisive action, imposing US sanctions North Korea . Specifically, the sanctions target North Korean national Song Kum Hyok. His alleged role? Orchestrating the placement of DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) IT workers into unsuspecting foreign companies. But these weren’t just any IT workers; they were reportedly covert operatives, leveraging their positions for cyber espionage and, crucially, for massive cryptocurrency thefts. This action underscores the U.S. government’s commitment to disrupting North Korea’s ability to generate revenue through illegal cyber activities, which directly funds its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs. The Treasury’s statement made it clear: Song Kum Hyok facilitated the deployment of these workers, who then exploited their access to company networks. This isn’t just about financial theft; it’s about national security. The funds generated are then funneled back to the regime, fueling its dangerous ambitions. This sanction serves as a warning to companies worldwide to enhance their due diligence, especially when hiring remote IT personnel, as the threat of infiltration is real and carries severe consequences. Unmasking North Korean IT Workers and Their Global Reach How do these North Korean IT workers operate, and why are they so effective? It’s a sophisticated scheme. These individuals often present themselves as freelance developers or employees of legitimate-looking front companies. They leverage their technical skills to gain employment in various sectors, from IT services to software development and even finance. Once embedded, they can engage in a range of malicious activities: Intellectual Property Theft: Stealing sensitive company data, designs, or proprietary software. Network Exploitation: Gaining unauthorized access to internal systems for future attacks or data exfiltration. Financial Fraud: Directly participating in or facilitating cryptocurrency thefts and other financial crimes. These workers are often highly skilled and operate under strict instructions from the DPRK government. Their primary goal is to generate hard currency, bypassing international sanctions that restrict North Korea’s access to traditional financial systems. The anonymity and speed offered by cryptocurrency make it an attractive target for these state-sponsored operatives, allowing them to move large sums of money across borders with relative ease. The Alarming Rise of Crypto Cyber Activity by DPRK: What’s the Impact? The DPRK’s reliance on crypto cyber activity has surged in recent years, becoming a cornerstone of its illicit fundraising strategy. These activities range from direct hacks of cryptocurrency exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to sophisticated phishing campaigns targeting individual crypto holders. The sheer scale of these operations is staggering, with estimates suggesting billions of dollars stolen over the past few years. But what does this mean for the average crypto user or investor? The impact is multifaceted: Erosion of Trust: High-profile hacks undermine confidence in the security of the crypto ecosystem. Financial Losses: Individuals and companies suffer direct financial losses from stolen assets. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased illicit activity leads to greater regulatory oversight, potentially impacting innovation and accessibility. Reputational Damage: Projects and platforms that are successfully attacked face significant reputational harm. It’s a constant cat-and-mouse game between cybersecurity experts, law enforcement, and these persistent threat actors. Every successful theft not only enriches the regime but also provides valuable intelligence and techniques for future attacks. The Shadowy Operations of the Lazarus Group: Who Are They? When discussing North Korea’s cyber capabilities, it’s impossible to ignore the notorious Lazarus Group . This state-sponsored hacking collective is widely recognized as one of the most prolific and dangerous cyber threat actors globally. Active since at least 2009, the Lazarus Group has been implicated in a string of high-profile cyberattacks, including the 2014 Sony Pictures hack, the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, and numerous cryptocurrency heists. Their methods are diverse, employing everything from sophisticated social engineering to zero-day exploits. Their connection to the North Korean government is well-documented by intelligence agencies worldwide. They serve as a vital arm of the regime, tasked with generating funds and conducting espionage. In the crypto space, their exploits are particularly infamous: Ronin Bridge Hack (2022): One of the largest crypto heists in history, with over $600 million stolen from Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network. Harmony Horizon Bridge Hack (2022): Another significant breach, resulting in over $100 million in stolen crypto. Numerous Exchange Hacks: Throughout the years, many centralized exchanges have fallen victim to Lazarus Group’s sophisticated attacks. Their operations are characterized by meticulous planning, advanced technical skills, and a relentless pursuit of financial gain for their benefactors. Understanding their tactics is crucial for anyone involved in the digital asset space. Tracing and Combatting Illicit Crypto Funds: A Global Challenge Once stolen, these illicit crypto funds don’t just disappear. They enter a complex web of laundering techniques designed to obscure their origins and make them usable by the North Korean regime. This is where the global fight against financial crime truly comes into play. Tracing these funds requires sophisticated blockchain analytics tools and international cooperation. Common laundering methods include: Mixers/Tumblers: Services that pool and mix cryptocurrencies from various sources to obscure transaction trails. Chain Hopping: Converting one cryptocurrency to another multiple times across different blockchains. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) and Cross-Chain Bridges: Leveraging these platforms to move funds rapidly and anonymously. Shell Companies and Sanctioned Entities: Using front companies or sanctioned individuals to facilitate transfers through traditional financial systems once crypto is converted to fiat. The challenge lies in the decentralized nature of blockchain and the speed at which transactions occur. However, significant progress is being made. Blockchain analytics firms like Chainalysis and Elliptic work closely with law enforcement agencies to trace these funds, often identifying patterns and ultimately leading to seizures or arrests. International bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) also play a critical role in setting global standards for anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) in the crypto space. What Can You Do? Actionable Insights for Security While governments and law enforcement work to combat these large-scale threats, individual crypto users and businesses also have a role to play. Here are some actionable insights: Strong Security Practices: Always use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all your crypto accounts and email. Be Wary of Phishing: Double-check URLs, email senders, and never click on suspicious links. Scammers often impersonate legitimate entities. Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, consider using a hardware wallet, which keeps your private keys offline. Software Updates: Keep all your software, operating systems, and antivirus programs updated to patch known vulnerabilities. Due Diligence for Hiring: Companies, especially those in tech, must implement robust background checks and verification processes for remote hires to prevent infiltration by malicious actors like the North Korean IT workers. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest cybersecurity threats and best practices in the crypto space. A Resilient Stand Against Digital Malice The U.S. Treasury’s sanction against Song Kum Hyok is more than just a punitive measure; it’s a clear signal that the international community is intensifying its efforts to dismantle North Korea’s illicit financial networks. The convergence of state-sponsored cyber warfare and cryptocurrency presents a formidable challenge, but one that is being met with increasing sophistication and collaboration. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, so too must our defenses. Vigilance, strong security protocols, and global cooperation are our strongest weapons in ensuring the integrity of the crypto ecosystem and preventing it from being exploited by those who seek to sow chaos and fund dangerous agendas.

Recently, the U.S. stock market delivered a mixed performance, leaving investors pondering the immediate implications and future trajectory. While the numbers might seem small at first glance, these subtle shifts in the U.S. Stock Market Trends often signal deeper currents that can influence everything from tech giants to Bitcoin’s price action. U.S. Stock Market Trends: What Do the Mixed Signals Mean? The recent close saw the three major U.S. stock indexes diverging, a scenario that often reflects underlying uncertainties rather than a clear market direction. This mixed bag performance highlights a market grappling with various forces, where different sectors react distinctly to prevailing economic narratives. Understanding these U.S. Stock Market Trends is crucial for any investor, traditional or crypto-focused. S&P 500: -0.07% – This broad market index, representing 500 of the largest U.S. companies, experienced a slight dip, indicating a cautious stance among a wide range of investors. Nasdaq Composite: +0.07% – Heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, Nasdaq’s marginal gain suggests resilience in the tech sector, perhaps driven by specific company news or continued enthusiasm for innovation. Dow Jones Industrial Average: -0.37% – Comprising 30 large, publicly owned companies, the Dow’s more pronounced decline points to headwinds faced by traditional industrial and financial sectors. This could be due to concerns over interest rates, inflation, or broader economic slowdowns affecting established businesses. Dissecting the Stock Market Performance: What Drove the Divergence? Why did these major indexes behave so differently? The nuanced Stock Market Performance can be attributed to several factors, underscoring the complexity of current market dynamics where a single narrative rarely dictates the entire market’s direction. Instead, it’s a tapestry woven from multiple threads of economic data and corporate actions, directly influencing overall Stock Market Performance . Sectoral Rotation: Investors might be shifting capital between different sectors. For instance, defensive sectors (utilities, consumer staples) might see inflows during uncertain times, while cyclical sectors (industrials, financials) could face pressure. Company-Specific News: Earnings reports, product launches, or regulatory announcements from influential companies within each index can sway their overall direction. A strong earnings report from a tech giant on Nasdaq could offset declines elsewhere. Interest Rate Expectations: Speculation around the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates significantly impacts growth stocks (Nasdaq) more than value stocks (often found in Dow/S&P). Higher rates make future earnings less attractive, especially for companies relying on cheap capital. Inflation Concerns: Persistent inflation can erode corporate profits and consumer purchasing power, impacting the broader market. Different sectors have varying abilities to pass on increased costs to consumers. Global Economic Outlook: How Does it Influence Market Movements? Beyond immediate market reactions, the broader Global Economic Outlook plays a pivotal role in shaping investor confidence and asset prices. These macroeconomic headwinds and tailwinds create a complex environment that filters down to individual company performance and, consequently, the major stock indexes. A cautious Global Economic Outlook often translates into a more volatile and uncertain market. Inflationary Pressures: Central banks worldwide are battling inflation, leading to aggressive interest rate hikes. This impacts borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing economic growth. Geopolitical Tensions: Conflicts and political instability in various regions can disrupt supply chains, increase commodity prices, and create uncertainty, pushing investors towards safer assets or causing broad market sell-offs. Supply Chain Disruptions: Lingering issues from the pandemic and recent geopolitical events continue to affect the production and distribution of goods, leading to higher costs and reduced corporate profitability. Energy Prices: Fluctuations in oil and gas prices can significantly impact transportation costs, manufacturing, and consumer spending, directly influencing corporate earnings and economic stability. Decoding Market Sentiment: What’s Driving Investor Psychology? While economic data and corporate earnings provide the fundamental backbone, Market Sentiment acts as the invisible hand, often dictating short-term price movements. The mixed close we observed is a direct reflection of conflicting sentiments among investors. Understanding and anticipating shifts in Market Sentiment is as crucial as analyzing balance sheets, especially in today’s interconnected financial world where emotions can amplify market swings. Cautious Optimism: Some investors might see opportunities in specific sectors or believe that inflation is peaking, leading to small gains in certain areas. Fear of Recession: Others might be pulling back, fearing an impending economic downturn, which leads to declines in more vulnerable sectors. Uncertainty and Indecision: The slight movements indicate that a significant portion of the market is in a ‘wait-and-see’ mode, lacking conviction for a strong directional move. This indecision often leads to choppy, range-bound trading. The Role of News Cycles: Daily headlines, from inflation reports to central bank speeches, can dramatically shift sentiment, creating knee-jerk reactions that may not always align with long-term fundamentals. Cryptocurrency Market Impact: How Do Stock Ripples Affect Crypto? Given the increasing correlation between traditional markets and digital assets, the performance of the U.S. Stock Market Trends invariably sends ripples into the cryptocurrency space. While crypto markets often march to their own beat, they are not entirely immune to the macroeconomic forces influencing stocks. The mixed close in the stock market serves as a reminder that even for crypto enthusiasts, keeping an eye on traditional financial indicators is essential. The interconnectedness means that significant shifts in the Cryptocurrency Market Impact can often be traced back to broader economic and financial market trends. Bitcoin’s Role as a Bellwether: Bitcoin, often seen as ‘digital gold’ by some and a ‘risk-on’ asset by others, frequently mirrors the movements of risk assets like tech stocks. A cautious stock market can lead to consolidation or minor pullbacks in Bitcoin, influencing the broader crypto market. Altcoin Volatility: Altcoins, generally more volatile than Bitcoin, tend to amplify the movements seen in Bitcoin. If Bitcoin reacts negatively to stock market weakness, altcoins can experience more significant declines. Liquidity Flows: When traditional markets face uncertainty, institutional and retail investors might reallocate capital, potentially drawing liquidity away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies or, conversely, seeking them as a hedge if they view them as non-correlated (though this view is currently less prevalent). Regulatory Environment: While not directly tied to daily stock movements, the overall regulatory climate for both traditional finance and crypto is influenced by the prevailing economic outlook. A tightening financial environment can lead to increased scrutiny on nascent industries like crypto. Challenges and Opportunities for Investors This mixed market signal presents both challenges and opportunities. The challenge lies in navigating the uncertainty and avoiding impulsive decisions based on short-term fluctuations. However, it also creates opportunities for strategic positioning: For Stock Investors: It might be a time to re-evaluate portfolios, focusing on quality companies with strong fundamentals that can weather economic headwinds. Diversification across sectors and asset classes becomes even more critical. For Crypto Investors: This period could be an opportune time for dollar-cost averaging into preferred assets or exploring projects with strong utility and long-term vision, rather than chasing speculative gains. Understanding the broader economic context helps in making informed decisions about your potential Cryptocurrency Market Impact . Actionable Insights for Navigating a Mixed Market How can you make sense of these complex signals and position yourself effectively? Stay Informed: Continuously monitor both traditional financial news and crypto-specific developments. Knowledge is your strongest defense against volatility. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio, including a mix of traditional assets and cryptocurrencies, can help mitigate risks. Define Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much risk you’re comfortable taking and adjust your investment strategy accordingly. This is particularly important when considering the potential Cryptocurrency Market Impact from traditional market movements. Long-Term Perspective: While daily fluctuations grab headlines, successful investing often hinges on a long-term view. Focus on the fundamentals and the potential for future growth rather than short-term noise. Consider Professional Advice: For complex financial decisions, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your goals. Summary: What Does a Mixed Close Truly Mean? The recent mixed close of the U.S. stock markets – with the S&P 500 and Dow dipping while Nasdaq held steady – is more than just a set of numbers. It’s a clear indicator of a market wrestling with conflicting forces, from inflation concerns to technological resilience. This nuanced Stock Market Performance reflects broader shifts in the Global Economic Outlook and directly influences Market Sentiment . For those in the digital asset space, understanding these U.S. Stock Market Trends is paramount, as the Cryptocurrency Market Impact is increasingly evident. In an era of interconnected finance, vigilance, diversification, and a long-term perspective remain the cornerstones of navigating these complex waters.

Trump’s comment was made in front of reporters after a question about the Federal Reserve’s renovation project, which has been under scrutiny. “Then he should resign immediately,” Trump said. “We should get somebody in there that’s going to lower interest rates.” Trump repeated that Powell was a “terrible” choice and made it clear he wants someone in charge of the Fed who will stop keeping borrowing costs high. According to Bloomberg, Trump has already been looking at replacements and plans to pick someone new when Powell’s term ends in May 2026. The president said last month he has three to four names on his list, all of whom he believes will support his push to cut rates. Trump boosts calls to investigate the Fed Criticism of Powell isn’t coming from Trump alone. Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, told lawmakers that Powell’s testimony about the ongoing renovations at the Fed’s headquarters was misleading. Pulte publicly called for an investigation into Powell’s statements, describing them as “deceptive.” Trump later amplified Pulte’s demand on social media, pushing for Powell’s resignation again. The Fed’s headquarters renovation project has drawn media attention for its skyrocketing costs and alleged extravagant features. During a Senate hearing, Powell said some of the reporting was “misleading and inaccurate in many, many respects.” Still, pressure from Trump and his allies continued to build. Trump has already taken shots at Powell for holding rates steady, saying his economic policies are being held hostage by a “stubborn mule and a stupid person.” He’s also contradicted himself on whether Powell will be fired, posting that “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” before later saying he has “no intention of firing him.” The central bank kept rates unchanged in June, holding them in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, where they’ve been since December. Powell told Congress that inflation trends would normally justify a rate cut, but uncertainty caused by tariff policies has forced the Fed to wait. Powell emphasized there’s no urgent need to make changes, and the bank will act carefully to avoid making things worse. Bessent distances himself from Fed rumors While Powell’s position becomes shakier, speculation has already started about who might be chosen to replace him. One name floated in DC circles is Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary. But Bessent pushed back against that during an interview with Maria Bartiromo on FOX Business. Speaking on Mornings with Maria , he said, “I think I have the best job in Washington. I get to interact with the president. The Cabinet that he’s chosen is fantastic, and being part of that Cabinet is the dream of a lifetime for me.” Bessent didn’t rule it out, though. He added, “I will go where the president thinks that I am best suited.” Bessent previously worked in finance and joined the administration from the hedge fund world. He’s shown he can represent Trump’s interests abroad. Earlier this year, he traveled to Switzerland with Jamieson Greer, the US Trade Representative, to help settle trade tensions with China. The two worked to find a soft landing amid heated tariff negotiations, making Bessent one of Trump’s key players when it comes to international economic strategy. Trump’s criticism of Powell isn’t new, but the timing of this latest push, combined with calls for investigations and talk of deception, shows a more aggressive stance from the White House. With Powell’s term ending in 2026, Trump is already shaping the future of the Federal Reserve. For now, Powell is still in his job.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its Wednesday trading day, bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade rangebound without any dominant market-moving headlines. The world's largest digital asset is trading above $108,900, according to CoinDesk market data , and the CoinDesk 20 index, a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, is above 3,100, up 1.7%. Right now, what separates bitcoin's drift to $110K from a rally is market conviction, say observers. In a recent report, Glassnode highlighted that spot volumes for BTC continue to linger below their usual statistical bands, ETF flows contracted sharply from recent highs, and institutional investors appear hesitant despite the climbing unrealized gains shown in elevated ETF Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratios. In a market update from earlier this week, Wintermute describes this cautious environment as a ""barbell market,"" pointing out a stark divide between renewed enthusiasm in high-beta assets, like memecoins, and the stability of established large-cap tokens. Last year's narrative darlings, notably AI and DePIN tokens, have lost investor attention, indicating that traders are rotating into memecoins, many of the majors like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE are up over 8% in the last week, or staying in BTC and ETH, which are seen as battle-tested and secure. With global equities largely shrugging off geopolitical uncertainties, BTC's hesitancy underscores lingering caution among traders, suggesting the market awaits clearer signals before breaking decisively higher. Things are likely to remain rangebound until that changes. News Recap: $100M Fund Backs Builders, Not Bettors, on Bitcoin Bitcoin-only VC firm Ego Death Capital has closed a $100 million second fund aimed at backing projects that treat Bitcoin as infrastructure, not a speculative trade, CoinDesk previously reported . The fund will target Series A rounds between $3 million and $8 million for startups solving real-world problems using Bitcoin’s base layer or its scaling solutions. “We’re investing in businesses that treat Bitcoin not as a trade, but as infrastructure—something to build on, not bet on,” said general partner Lyn Alden. Ego’s existing portfolio includes Relai, a self-custody app, and Roxom, a securities exchange built directly on Bitcoin rails. At a time when multichain VCs are chasing yield on every new L2 and L3, Ego’s thesis is a bet on simplicity and durability: Bitcoin’s dominance remains above 60%, and the fund aims to capitalize on its staying power. The message to allocators: ignore the hype, back the rails that last. News Recap: Judge Bars Sanctions Talk in Tornado Cash Trial, Limits Free Speech Defense A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. government's sanctions against Tornado Cash, which were imposed in 2022 and later overturned, cannot be discussed in the upcoming criminal trial of developer Roman Storm, CoinDesk previously reported . Judge Katherine Polk Failla said allowing the jury to hear about the now-invalid sanctions would require ""mental gymnastics"" and risk confusing the core legal issues at trial. The sanctions were originally imposed by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) over alleged use of the mixer by North Korea’s Lazarus Group, but were struck down earlier this year in a separate case, Van Loon v. Treasury . Storm faces multiple criminal charges related to his role in building Tornado Cash, a privacy tool that allows users to obscure the origin of crypto transactions. Prosecutors allege that he profited substantially from the project, citing evidence of multi-million-dollar TORN token sales and real estate purchases. Judge Failla also ruled that evidence obtained from fellow Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev’s phone can be admitted at trial, despite objections from Storm’s legal team who argued the material was cherry-picked and not independently verifiable. Although Storm is free to speak about his belief in privacy and civil liberties, the judge said he will not be allowed to frame his actions as protected under the First Amendment. The court drew a distinction between personal beliefs and legal defenses. A final pre-trial hearing is scheduled for Friday, with the trial slated to begin on June 14 and expected to last four weeks. The outcome of the case is likely to set an important precedent for how U.S. courts treat developers of open-source privacy tools. Market Movements: BTC : Bitcoin maintained institutional-grade resilience during the July 7–8 trading cycle, holding above the key $108,000 level while navigating heavy resistance at $109,200 and finding strategic support near $107,470, signaling continued confidence from corporate treasuries despite late-session profit-taking, according to CoinDesk's market insights bot. ETH: Ethereum rose 3% to $2,610 during the July 7–8 session as institutional investors deployed $515 million in coordinated weekend buying, driving volumes to nearly triple the average and pushing the asset through key resistance levels Gold: Gold fell 1.2% to below $3,300 on Tuesday as optimism over delayed reciprocal tariffs and hopes for new trade deals weakened safe-haven demand, while markets awaited FOMC minutes for further rate guidance. Nikkei 225: Asian markets traded mixed Wednesday as Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 8.39 points (0.021%) after U.S. President Trump ruled out delaying August 1 tariffs, imposed a 50% duty on copper imports, and warned of potential 200% pharmaceutical tariffs with an 18-month grace period. S&P 500: The S&P 500 closed nearly unchanged on Tuesday after President Donald Trump confirmed there would be no exemptions to the August 1 tariff rollout.

The merger is expected to close sometime between October and December this year, and the company is aiming to raise over $1 billion in the process. The company says it will manage a crypto portfolio that includes bitcoin, ethereum, and Solana, and plans to align its strategy with the U.S. strategic crypto reserve. The entire push is part of a broader effort to package crypto into equity to make it more appealing to institutional investors. The idea isn’t new. Michael Saylor’s company, MicroStrategy, did something similar in 2020 when it switched to a bitcoin-centered model and saw its stock price explode. ReserveOne is following that same model but throwing in more firepower from the top. ReserveOne adds crypto insiders and ex-Trump official to board Jaime Leverton, who previously ran crypto mining company Hut 8, is leading ReserveOne as CEO. Jaime said the firm’s upper-level team stands out because of its deep ties to finance, regulation, and crypto. “Our management team and anticipated board of directors bring a really unique pedigree and diversity of background between Wall Street and regulatory and crypto,” she told Reuters. Sebastian Bea, who previously held senior roles at BlackRock and Coinbase Asset Management, will take over as president and lead investment strategy. The board will be chaired by Reeve Collins, one of the co-founders of Tether, the largest stablecoin company. It’ll also include Chinh Chu, formerly at Blackstone, and Wilbur Ross, the former U.S. Secretary of Commerce under President Donald Trump. Jaime said Wilbur was skeptical of crypto at first but “over the last number of months, he’s really opened up to this space.” ReserveOne says it will not only hold crypto but also put it to work. The company plans to lend out assets and stake them to earn regular payouts. This institutional staking model is already common in crypto, but ReserveOne thinks doing it as a public company makes it more credible to larger investors. Backing this entire deal are two well-known crypto companies, Kraken and Blockchain.com, who are putting in up to $750 million in combined equity and convertible debt. The blank-check structure gives ReserveOne a shortcut to the public markets, skipping the longer traditional IPO route. Blank-check firms like M3-Brigade are shell companies that raise funds first and then look for a private firm to merge with. Once the deal is complete, the private company becomes publicly listed. That’s how ReserveOne is landing on the Nasdaq.

But at the same time when old names are in trouble, an emergent force is winning all the attention. The token that is bucking the trend is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which rocketed towards the parabola in July and has piqued the interest of analysts and retail traders. Mutuum Finance is at presale stage 5 at $0.03. The stage is already more than 60% sold. With more than $11.9 million already raised and more than 12800 investors, Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum. As old coins such as DOGE feel the pressure of changing moods and overall crypto news today, everyone is turning towards this blisteringly-swelling Mutuum Finance as it rises in the ranks. Dogecoin Faces Bearish Pressure Near $0.16 as Investors Shift Focus Dogecoin (DOGE) is under pressure of a resurgent bearish mood as its trading volume weakens and large holders seemingly unwind their positions. Having tested a level of support just above $0.16 briefly, DOGE is still at a crossroad, as traders are not sure whether it can revive a bullish momentum or move lower. Even though the meme coin continues to enjoy high brand awareness and community support, the recent price movement indicates that the entire market is wary of risk-asset-based tokens. With Dogecoin unable to regain its upwards pace, many investors are now considering minor projects with more massive growth prospects – such as Mutuum Finance, which is not losing any traction in its presale. Mutuum Finance Presale Hits $11.9 Million Mark Fast Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has reached more than 12,800 investors in a presale of more than $11.9 million. Hype for the project is off the charts and this is clearly a great sign of the project’s future. MUTM tokens cost $0.03 in phase 5 but will rise 16.67% in phase 6. This phase is over 60% sold out as investors scramble to jump in at the lowest price. The need is becoming exponentially high and the fact that Mutuum Finance is a disruptor in DeFi is even more valuable considering the fact that it will be among the popular crypto investments of 2025. MUTM Giveaway Offers $100,000 in Rewards Mutuum Finance is set to reward the early supporters it has on its platform and has established a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 participants will be chosen and rewarded with $10,000 MUTM tokens. It will be a reward to the quickly expanding community inside the project and gratitude for early investors. But time’s running out. Mutuum Finance Prioritizes Security with New $50K Bounty Mutuum Finance has launched its Bug Bounty Program with the support and cooperation of CertiK, and a maximum 50,000 USDT rewards pool will be provided. Reward falls in four categories namely; Major, critical, minor, and low to ensure that each level of exposure will be rewarded. This is another measure that demonstrates that Mutuum is a project with a proactive safety stance and its commitment to the development of the atmosphere favoring the finances that can be trusted. Dogecoin (DOGE) is under the pressure of bears and is unable to break above $0.16, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trending against the current and thriving on investors pressure. Having raised over $11.9 million and involving more than 12,800 investors, Mutuum is becoming one of the stand-out DeFi projects in July. The MUTM tokens will be sold at 0.03 and the price is expected to increase by 16.67% in Stage 6 which gives the initial buyers a clear edge in terms of price. It has a $100K giveaway, a $50K CertiK-guaranteed bug bounty, and an effective DeFi structure, which makes Mutuum a strong candidate in the running to become the best crypto investment in 2025. Buy your allocation before the next price jump-up.

47846048,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=785060,1752024636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/47846048.jpeg,ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B – Liquidity On The Rise,https://www.newsbtc.com/stablecoin/erc-20-stablecoin-supply-hits-all-time-high-at-121b-liquidity-on-the-rise/,"While Bitcoin struggles to break above its all-time high and altcoins face difficulty finding solid support, one corner of the crypto market continues to expand: stablecoins. Since the beginning of the bull run, the stablecoin market has shown consistent growth, cementing its reputation as one of crypto’s most reliable and scalable use cases. Unlike volatile assets, stablecoins offer stability, liquidity, and utility across DeFi, trading, and settlement. Related Reading: Ethereum Range Tightens – Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350 Top analyst Darkfost recently shared fresh data and highlighted a key development many have overlooked — the total supply of ERC-20 stablecoins is rising again. As of today, it has reached a new all-time high of $121 billion. This milestone signals renewed demand and liquidity entering the crypto ecosystem, at a time when other sectors appear stagnant. The rise in stablecoin supply underscores the sector’s resilience and importance. While speculative tokens face resistance, stablecoins thrive on utility and adoption. Whether for hedging, yield strategies, or capital movement, their role in crypto remains foundational. As the broader market waits for its next move, the silent growth in stablecoin supply could be an early signal of renewed momentum across the board. The stablecoin narrative is far from over — in fact, it may just be starting. Stablecoin Growth Accelerates: On-Chain Data Points To Renewed Liquidity Stablecoins have emerged as one of the most impactful innovations in crypto, creating a vital bridge between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). This narrative gained massive traction in June when Circle (NASDAQ: CRCL), the company behind USDC, went public on the New York Stock Exchange. Initially priced at $31 per share, Circle’s IPO exceeded all expectations — closing the day at $82.84, marking a 167% gain. Today, CRCL trades nearly six times above its IPO price, giving the company a $42 billion market cap and reinforcing confidence in the stablecoin business model. On-chain insights shared by Darkfost add another layer to the story. According to the data, the total supply of ERC-20 stablecoins has started rising again and just hit a new all-time high of $121 billion. ERC-20 stablecoins are cryptocurrencies built on the Ethereum blockchain that follow the ERC-20 token standard. They are designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar (e.g., USDC, USDT, DAI). This surge in supply is critical because stablecoins are minted on demand — their issuance directly reflects user demand and fresh liquidity entering the system. This expanding supply meets the needs of protocols and exchanges that face rising user activity and capital inflows. While market sentiment remains cautious, if the stablecoin supply continues to grow, it would signal renewed risk appetite and capital deployment. In that case, stablecoins may once again serve as the early catalyst for the next major phase in the crypto bull cycle. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low – Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Dominance Hovers Below 8%: A Neutral Yet Strategic Positioning The weekly chart shows stablecoin dominance currently sitting at 7.90%, a level that reflects cautious but sustained interest in liquidity reserves across the crypto market. After a sharp climb between 2020 and mid-2022—when stablecoin dominance peaked above 16% during risk-off periods—dominance has gradually declined, aligning with risk-on rotations into Bitcoin and altcoins during bull runs. However, since early 2024, dominance has consolidated between 7% and 10%, signaling a more balanced environment. The current level remains just above the 50-week and 100-week moving averages (7.76% and 8.02%, respectively), suggesting strong horizontal support. Meanwhile, the 200-week moving average at 9.30% acts as a long-term ceiling. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Downside If Resistance Holds: $2,700 Level Is Critical This neutral position implies that market participants are neither fully risk-on nor risk-off. If dominance rises from here, it could either reflect increased fear (capital flowing out of volatile assets) or fresh liquidity entering the market, especially if paired with a rise in stablecoin supply, which we’re already witnessing with ERC-20 tokens.

While ETH and SOL have long dominated as go-to picks for smart contract ecosystems, a growing wave of traders is rotating capital into an explosive new opportunity: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Early participants believe this high-energy presale could become the best altcoin buy right now , with the potential to mirror — or even surpass — the early days of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE. Why Are Ethereum and Solana Holders Flocking to MAGACOIN FINANCE? Crypto markets thrive on narratives, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is crafting one that’s impossible to ignore. Positioned as a political meme coin with serious tokenomics , it taps into viral U.S. political culture in a way that resonates deeply with meme traders, retail enthusiasts, and even seasoned altcoin whales. Unlike countless low-effort meme tokens that rely purely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has laid down solid foundations that are attracting thousands of Ethereum and Solana investors seeking higher ROI plays. Its capped supply of 170 billion tokens , zero-tax trading , and strict anti-inflation mechanics are designed to favor community growth and price momentum — a sharp contrast to many bloated meme tokens that dilute value over time. The Power of FOMO: Sold-Out Rounds and Limited Spots Left Perhaps the biggest reason MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing such attention is the undeniable sense of urgency and scarcity surrounding its presale. Earlier stages sold out in record time, locking in thousands of early investors and pushing demand for remaining allocations through the roof. With each presale stage fully subscribed, Ethereum and Solana wallets have begun piling in, eager to secure allocations before the next price bump. It’s the classic crypto snowball effect: the more early rounds fill, the stronger the community hype becomes , attracting fresh waves of buyers who don’t want to miss the next 50x, 75x, or even 100x opportunity. Ranked a Top Meme Coin and Best Altcoin Presale for 2025 Analysts and crypto influencers have already dubbed MAGACOIN FINANCE a top meme coin to watch , comparing it favorably to the explosive early growth seen by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. But beyond the memes, many also see it as one of the best altcoin picks overall , citing its zero-tax ecosystem, transparent no-VC structure, and audited smart contract — features rarely combined in meme or microcap projects. Community momentum is equally impressive. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s social channels have surged past 20,000 active members , with thousands of wallets tracking the presale. Telegram and Twitter communities are buzzing daily with discussions, memes, and user-generated content, fueling a viral loop that’s been key to breakout stories in the past. Still Early — But Moving Fast The most compelling argument for Ethereum and Solana holders to rotate into MAGACOIN FINANCE might be that it’s still early . While the presale has already locked in significant demand, many analysts believe this is just the start. Unlike mainstream altcoins that have already priced in much of their growth, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer a rare asymmetric opportunity: a small initial investment can translate into massive upside if the project achieves even a fraction of the community traction or listings that older giants enjoy. Given how quickly previous meme favorites like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE delivered life-changing gains for early believers, it’s no wonder traders are now calling MAGACOIN FINANCE their top speculative bet of the year . Is MAGACOIN FINANCE Really the Best Crypto Presale Right Now? Many seasoned altcoin traders think so. With multiple sold-out stages , a unique meme narrative that captures global attention, rock-solid tokenomics (including an independent audit), and thousands of Ethereum and Solana investors rotating into the presale, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be one of the most exciting crypto stories of the cycle. Whether it ultimately joins the ranks of early Dogecoin or Shiba Inu remains to be seen. But for those on the hunt for the next 100x moonshot , the signals are hard to ignore: limited spots left, rising hype, and an eager community all pushing in the same direction. That’s a recipe that has launched countless altcoins into the stratosphere — and MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be checking every box. Final Thoughts If you’re looking for the best crypto presale to watch right now , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out not just because of its meme appeal, but because of how methodically it’s structured for growth. As Ethereum and Solana whales diversify into high-upside plays, this project is quickly climbing to the top of watchlists across the crypto world. As always, it’s smart to do your own research. But with limited presale allocations remaining, thousands already locked in, and analysts calling it a potential breakout meme coin of the year , FOMO might just have good reason to kick in.

47846157,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=762527,1752024668,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47846157.jpeg,Hype fades as NFT platforms lose users,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nft-market-slumps-for-fifth-straight-quarter/,"The NFT market has reached its lowest point in a year and a half, suggesting a long winter in digital collectibles ahead. Their sales volume fell to $823 million in the second quarter of 2025, down from $4 billion over the same period in 2024, according to a new report by DappRadar. That’s a 19% drop from the first quarter of this year and the fifth consecutive quarterly decline. This ongoing bust paints a bleak picture for digital collectible investors and creators. So far, 2025 is the worst year in NFT history, with no real recovery prospects. Nearly every part of the industry is reeling from the steep drop, from well-established collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club to newer and smaller projects vying to prove their worth and utility. There are several reasons behind the decline, experts say. Interest has waned among the retail traders who, in recent months, flocked to digital collectibles in search of a quick buck. High gas fees on Ethereum, dwindling media buzz, and increasing skepticism about the long-term value of NFTs haven’t helped, either. In other words, fewer people buy, sell, or talk about digital collectibles. Hype fades as NFT platforms lose users NFTs came crashing into the mainstream in 2021 and 2022. They made millionaires overnight from artists and spawned a new generation of digital collectors. Landmark sales, most notably the Beeple auction at Christie’s , which took in $69 million, made headlines around the globe. In this golden age, trading volume in digital collectibles soared past $50 billion a year, and some crude cartoon images changed hands for more than $500,000 apiece. But the gold rush didn’t go on forever. But just as rapidly as NFTs ascended, they began to tumble. Prices began to tumble in mid-2022, erasing billions in value. Collections that once commanded high-profile attention now sell for a fraction of their peak prices. Numerous investors are now left clutching essentially worthless assets. The decline in traffic and trading activity has impacted even major NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, once the dominant platform for collectors. Others, including LooksRare and Blur, are dangling heavy incentives to keep users to little avail. Not even bands and celebrities that were once most aggressively promoting digital collectibles — from basketball players to internet stars — are making much noise. Many projects launched during the hype period are either dead or claimed to be scams. With buyer sentiment down, the mood around digital collectibles has turned to cautious optimism and even skepticism. Trump launches NFTs but fails to revive market And one of the last high-profile figures still pushing digital collectibles is the US president, Donald Trump. Since taking the political stage again, he has released four NFT collections, all dedicated to bold and sometimes humorous interpretations of himself, images of himself in superhero outfits, clutching gold bars, or even appearing to hug the cryptocurrency Bitcoin symbolically. Each of his prior releases has sold out within hours. Trump also held a special NFT holders ’ dinner in 2023 that attracted a lot of media coverage. The NFT drops have become part of his fundraising strategy, a mishmash of politics, pop culture, and crypto. But even Trump’s celebrity draw hasn’t reversed the broader tide. The Bitwise Blue-Chip NFT Collections Index, which measures the performance of top NFT art and collectible projects, has dropped 52% since January 2024, when Trump’s re-election campaign started to heat up. This tells us that though stock drops from new infections may cause an initial blip of interest, they don’t seem to move markets back sustainably. Meanwhile, other segments of the crypto space are proving more resilient. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum rebounded in price in 2024 thanks to institutional investment and optimism around exchange-traded funds (ETFs). But NFTs have not benefited from that bounce.

Announced on Tuesday, the investment will fund the creation of the National Academy for AI Instruction (NAAI), a program designed to train 400,000 K–12 teachers over the next five years. The initiative will offer free in-person workshops, hands-on seminars, and virtual learning modules to help educators effectively integrate AI into their teaching practices. The training will cover using AI for tasks like lesson planning, grading, communication, and classroom management—enhancing, not replacing, the teacher’s role. The program is being launched in collaboration with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), one of the largest teachers’ unions in the country, underscoring strong support from within the education sector. Microsoft is the lead investor in the project, signaling the tech giant’s growing focus on the education space. The initiative aims to empower teachers with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to use AI as a supportive tool, streamlining administrative work, boosting creativity, and freeing up more time for direct student engagement. Tech firms set up first AI training hub in NYC The first stationary training location will be in Manhattan, NY, opening in late summer or early fall. The school will eventually grow to other physical locations throughout the country. Alongside in-person instruction, the academy will feature distance-learning sessions to ensure that even teachers in rural or underserved areas can take advantage of the resources. A training program will introduce the technology and explain how it might be applied in real classroom settings, including the use of AI for tutoring, automating lesson plans, creating tailored assignments for students, and helping students who learn differently from the majority of their class. Sessions will also discuss AI ethics, bias, data privacy, and student safety — all of which are at the top of educators’ and parents’ minds. “When it comes to AI in schools, the question is whether it is being used to disrupt education for the benefit of students and teachers or at their expense,” Chris Lehane, chief global affairs officer of OpenAI, said in a statement. “We want this technology to be used by teachers for their benefit, by helping them to learn, to think and to create.” Tech companies accelerate AI education push The new academy arrives as demand for AI in education continues to grow across the United States. In April, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a White House Task Force on AI Education that called for public-private partnerships to encourage AI literacy in K–12 education. It has emerged as one of the biggest fruits of that order yet. Tech companies have been aggressively building up their presence in education. OpenAI has also worked with the California State University system to give AI tools to more than 500,000 students and faculty members. Anthropic, which developed the Claude AI assistant, released Claude for Education on Wednesday, a customized version of its chatbot for higher education users, almost two months after the company made its official product debut. Through its competitive Google for Education program, Google is still signing deals with public schools and universities to bring AI-powered tools for administration and learning. Such moves are happening as there is a dawning realization that AI literacy is as important as digital literacy has become, especially for the next generation of students and workers. However, the speed with which things have changed has also stirred concerns about fairness, access, and misuse. Dealing with that concern, the academy’s developers say they’re creating the program with teachers in every aspect. Responsible and inclusive use of AI in schools will be a blinkered target to ensure the technology positively impacts learning, not negatively.

Watching coins move up while you stay on the sidelines can be frustrating. This is why finding top crypto coins to buy today is important for those aiming for better growth. People want coins that actually give real returns instead of just hype. In this detailed guide, you will learn why Avalanche, AAVE, Aptos, and BlockDAG are among the top crypto coins to buy today and why they deserve your focus right now. Do not let today pass while others collect gains you could have grabbed. 1. BlockDAG: Early Access Brings Massive Potential Those searching for top crypto coins to buy today should check out BlockDAG (BDAG) , which is the biggest presale crypto in history! It is rapidly moving towards its GLOBAL LAUNCH release event on August 11, placing it ahead of many new projects. BlockDAG is a Layer 1 blockchain built using DAG tech, offering quick transactions, strong scalability, and smooth parallel processing. BDAG coins are currently priced at just $0.0016 until August 11th, allowing early users to join at the cheapest rate. With plans for a listing price of $0.05, many see a chance for over 30× growth, and some even expect BDAG could reach $1 post-launch. The project has already raised $333 million in presale funding, sold 23.7 billion coins, and is in presale batch 29. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. BlockDAG has cleared security audits by CertiK and Halborn and plans to list on 20 exchanges, including MEXC, BitMart, and LBANK. With these strong steps and ready-to-use tools, BlockDAG ranks among the top crypto coins to buy today. 2. Avalanche: Growth Through Custom Subnets Avalanche (AVAX) continues to gain strong support this month for enabling companies and government bodies to build their own blockchains. Its subnet model lets users build networks matching their needs, such as rules, fees, and privacy. Avalanche is expanding in the Middle East with digital projects and blockchain platforms. This practical use case makes AVAX one of the top crypto coins to buy today. Its sub-second finality ensures quick transactions, increasing trust and value locked. If AVAX remains above $18, experts believe it could rise toward $44 to $50 in the coming months. With its strong tech and more adoption, Avalanche remains solid. 3. Aave: Leading DeFi with New Options In DeFi, Aave (AAVE) continues to stand out thanks to new features that add user value. The Umbrella Protocol allows a form of decentralized insurance, where users stake tokens to cover risks and protect against bad debt, while DAO funds also support risk cover. It also added multi-asset functions and Binance perpetual contracts, raising strong market interest. With more than $25.5 billion in total value locked and $42 million in monthly fee earnings, Aave proves its use and trust. It remains one of the top crypto coins to buy today. Many say if AAVE breaks above $283, it could aim near $324. With ongoing upgrades, Aave remains strong in DeFi growth. 4. Aptos: Signs of Revival After a Rough Period Aptos (APT) has finally started to gain momentum following months of price drops. It uses the Move programming language and parallel processing, making it secure and good for developers. Fresh upgrades and community plans are drawing attention back to APT. Because of these positive updates, Aptos stands as one of the top crypto coins to buy today. Its price moved above $5.00 recently, ending the downtrend, and if support stays firm, it could reach between $5.55 and $6.00. This comeback could bring surprises for many traders this month. Key Takeaway! Looking at AVAX, AAVE, and APT shows they hold real promise. AVAX offers custom chains with speed, AAVE leads DeFi with fresh features, and APT is bouncing back strong. They stand as the top crypto coins to buy today with growth chances. But BlockDAG presents unmatched early entry power. Its upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH Release, affordable price of $0.0016 till August 11th, and advanced DAG tech make it stand out from all.

Investors clearly aren’t flinching. They’ve heard it before. And this time, they’re not pulling money out of the system. According to CNBC , the MSCI All Country World Index, which tracks over 2,500 stocks worldwide, jumped nearly 10% since January and hit an all-time high on July 4. Greece, Poland, and the Czech Republic are leading the global pack with massive year-to-date gains. Greece is up nearly 60%, Poland jumped 56%, and the Czech Republic hit 52%, all beating out the US, which only managed about 7% during the same stretch. Europe gains while American stocks crawl Greece’s equity surge is backed by a mix of banking gains, economic recovery, and tourist dollars. Gabriel Sacks, who leads global emerging markets equities at Aberdeen, said Greece has been ahead in Eastern Europe for a while, thanks to its economy bouncing back, cleaned-up banks, and a strong tourism season. Investors also liked that the Greek government started paying back its bailout debt early and kept running fiscal surpluses. George Efstathopoulos, a multi-asset manager at Fidelity International, said Greek stocks should keep climbing because of how well Greek banks are doing. Poland and the Czech Republic followed close behind, with strong year-to-date performances. Among the ten top-performing markets globally, eight are in Europe. Alongside Greece, Poland, and the Czech Republic, other top performers include Spain, Italy, and Germany. Michael Field, the EMEA Chief Equity Market Strategist at Morningstar, said the “sell America” trend at the start of the year and improving economic numbers in Europe pulled cash into those markets. Michelle Gibley, Director of International Research at Schwab, said Germany’s break from austerity also helped fuel growth. Defense and bank stocks in Europe are performing well and facing less risk from US tariffs. Mark Mobius, who chairs the Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund, said those sectors are safer from Trump’s trade policies and still producing solid returns. Meanwhile, US stocks took a hit earlier in the year as investors fled Trump’s chaotic economic messaging. But by midyear, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq managed to recover and hit fresh highs. Still, their total growth this year is low compared to the booming European markets. Asia splits as Korea rises and Thailand crashes Asia’s performance is all over the place. South Korea has been one of the few bright spots, jumping over 30% year-to-date. That came despite Trump putting a 25% tariff on Korean exports and political drama back home. Daniel Yoo, a global strategist at Yuanta Securities, said the market already expected the tariffs and priced them in. He thinks there’s still a chance those tariffs get reduced if talks drag out until August 1, the deadline for the countries still negotiating with Trump’s White House. Manishi Raychaudhuri, the CEO at Emmer Capital Partners, said Korean exporters might survive Trump’s trade hits because US buyers would probably just eat the extra costs. Investors were also optimistic after Lee Jae-myung from the opposition party won a snap election in June, replacing Yoon Suk Yeol. Yoon had tried to declare martial law earlier in the year and got forced out. Morningstar’s senior analyst Kai Wang said sectors like shipbuilding and high-bandwidth AI chip manufacturing helped fuel Korea’s growth. China’s stock market climbed more than 17% this year, even while staying in Trump’s crosshairs. Steven Sun, head of research at HSBC Qianhai Securities, said investors expect the yuan to strengthen, earnings to improve, and policies to help. But he warned there’s no major stimulus planned, so pressure remains on China’s overall growth. Thailand is at the very bottom. Its market dropped more than 13% in 2025, dragged down by political messes, weak tourism, and US auto tariffs that hit Thai car part exports. Sacks said the country is still trying to crawl out of the Covid-era slump. Right above Thailand sits Turkey, where inflation, capital flight, and political repression continue to scare off investors. Sacks said any hopes for recovery disappeared when Istanbul’s mayor was arrested. Mobius added that the Turkish lira collapsing by almost 13% against the US dollar didn’t help either.

If you’re still reminiscing about the early Doge or Shiba days, this may be your second chance. The Memecoin Market Is Hot—Again Let’s be clear: SHIB and DOGE still dominate headlines. Their whale-driven moves, social buzz, and decades-in-the-making lore continue to drive speculative attention. But with volatility, mixed community sentiment, and evolving ecosystems, many investors are now scanning the horizon for the next viral hit. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the chat – not as a copycat, but as a cultural force of its own . MAGACOIN FINANCE: Not Just Another Meme MAGACOIN FINANCE is breaking through the crypto noise with a rare combination of meme energy, political flair, and smart, transparent design. From its inception, the project ditched the typical “get-rich-quick” token tactics and opted for zero tax , decentralized governance , and no venture capital influence – a direct appeal to the grassroots crypto crowd. This isn’t just about memes – it’s about movement. What really separates MAGACOIN FINANCE is its narrative-driven positioning . Inspired by bold, ideological themes, it’s galvanizing a highly engaged community who aren’t just buying in, they’re buying into something bigger. This is the type of organic story that meme coins thrive on. Selling Fast: Presale Frenzy The MAGACOIN FINANCE presale is already the stuff of legend. With multiple sold-out stages and limited spots remaining, the project is gaining traction at warp speed. Social channels like Telegram and Twitter/X are exploding with activity. Influencers are getting in. And early adopters are calling it the “ next Doge/Shiba ” before listings even hit. Presales rarely feel this kinetic unless the energy is real—and here, it is! Community Power & Exchange Speculation One of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s biggest weapons is its community. Every great meme coin rise, from DOGE to PEPE, was fueled by users who rallied behind an idea. In 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is that idea. Telegram admins are swamped, site traffic is booming, and the culture around the project feels electric. Adding more fuel to the fire? Growing rumors of imminent exchange listings . If true, this could catapult visibility and liquidity, locking in MAGACOIN FINANCE as a frontrunner for top altcoin of the year. A Cultural Bet in a Speculative Market In a market where utility isn’t always king, culture is currency – and MAGACOIN FINANCE understands this better than most. It’s a project that taps into collective identity, irony, rebellion, and financial upside – all wrapped in a meme-powered wrapper. This isn’t just another dog token. It’s a movement-meets-market coin, and in 2025, that’s what makes things go 100x. Final Take: Still Early, Still Climbing SHIBA and DOGE may be trending, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is transcending. With narrative momentum, a surging community, and a presale that’s already turning heads, it’s more than hype, it’s the top meme coin narrative in play right now. If you missed the early days of DOGE or SHIB, this might be your next shot. But act fast – spots are limited, momentum is building, and the window may close just as fast as it opened.

BTC is now recovering losses and might aim for a move above the $109,200 resistance. Bitcoin started a recovery wave above the $108,000 zone. The price is trading above $108,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $109,050 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $107,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Eyes Upside Break Bitcoin price started a fresh decline after it failed near the $110,000 zone. BTC declined below the $108,500 and $108,000 levels before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $107,650 and the price started a recovery wave. There was a move above the $108,500 resistance zone. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $109,700 swing high to the $107,500 low. Bitcoin is now trading above $108,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . The first key resistance is near the $109,050 level. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $109,050 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The next resistance could be $109,200 or the 76.4% Fib level of the downward move from the $109,700 swing high to the $107,500 low. A close above the $109,200 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $110,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $112,000 level. The main target could be $115,000. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $109,200 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $108,400 level. The first major support is near the $108,200 level. The next support is now near the $107,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $105,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $103,500, below which BTC might continue to move down. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $108,500, followed by $107,500.

The unprecedented demand has sent a jolt of uncertainty through financial markets, including the already volatile crypto sector. Trump criticized Powell accusing him for deliberately delaying interest rate cuts and acting favorably toward the previous administration.

The USDT issuer directly owns the vast majority of about 80 tons of gold stockpile outright. However, precious metals represent only 5% of Tether’s $112 billion reserve portfolio, per the company’s March attestation. “We have our own vault. I believe it’s the most secure vault in the world,” Ardoino noted, declining to reveal the whereabouts of the Swiss vault due to security concerns. USDT stablecoin reached a market cap of $159 billion last month, claiming 62.43% of the entire $255 billion stablecoin ecosystem. The company’s gold reserves match the UBS Group’s total precious metals and commodities exposure, the report added. Tether Gold Reserves Signals Pivot From Pure Fiat Exposure In Ardoino’s books, gold’s safe-haven status helps buffer against fiat or regulatory turbulence. He said that the precious metal is a safer asset than any national currency. “Eventually, I think that if people start to get concerned about the potential increase of the debt of the US, they might look at alternatives,” he told Bloomberg. Further, the recent surge in gold prices is fueled by central bank buying and a return of investor interest in gold ETFs, according to a report from J.P. Morgan . “Every single central bank in the BRICS countries is buying gold,” Ardoino added. Gold Reserves Could Lower Custody Costs Tether has been widely known for its association with gold, launching a gold-based token, Tether Gold, that recently showed stable gains . According to Ardoino, the company’s decision to own its own gold vault is due to the high costs that precious metal vault operators charge. If Tether’s gold token were to grow to $100 billion in circulation, “it’s a lot of money to pay 50 basis points,” said Ardoino. “If you have your own vault, eventually with the size, it gets much cheaper to do custody.” @Tether_to has invested in blockchain analytics firm Crystal Intelligence to boost efforts against illicit stablecoin use. #CryptoSecurity #BlockchainCompliance https://t.co/f1Stp5c6fi — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 8, 2025 The post Tether Quietly Built $8B Gold Reserves in Swiss Vault to Reduce Custody Costs: Report appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Gold|Paolo Ardoino|Tether,EN,0,0,FIAT|USDT|XAUT|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-07-09 02:53:49

After consolidating within a tight range, the breakout suggests that momentum is shifting back in favor of the bulls, and potentially setting the stage for a rapid push toward higher resistance levels. Pullback Or Launchpad? What Bitcoin’s Next Move Could Look Like According to MaxFINEancial’s latest analysis on X, he highlighted that a large green double bottom is forming within an orange bull flag on the 1-hour chart, which is a bullish continuation setup. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heating Up? NVT Golden Cross Hints At Potential Local Top The local high was a test of the trigger line of the double bottom, which signaled intent from the bulls. BTC is retesting the upper edge of the bull flag, aligning with the 1-hour 200-day MA, a critical dynamic support level that often dictates short-term momentum. MaxFINEancial projects a small pink bullish pennant forming and setting up for a continuation move higher. However, a rare diamond top pattern could also be taking shape, a bearish reversal formation that, if validated, may trigger a sharp downside move. If BTC loses the 1-hour 200-day MA, he advises shifting focus to the 4-hour 200-day MA, which is the line of defense. The important bullish area targets are $113,700, $115,867, $117,030, and $122,143, while the bearish diamond top target is $103,079. Market analyst A_y has also highlighted that Bitcoin is consolidating below the $110,000 resistance on the 4-hour chart, with the structure forming a textbook ascending triangle. This setup is the rising higher lows against horizontal resistance that precedes a strong breakout. If BTC manages to break above $110,000, the move could accelerate toward the $112,000 to $114,000 range, marking a bullish trend. However, failure to breach this ceiling may lead to a pullback toward $104,000, where previous demand has stepped in. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neutral, suggesting that there is room for momentum to build, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bullish crossover, that is hinting at potential upward momentum, BTC is still trading below the EMA, which means bulls need to prove strength for a confirmed breakout. Bitcoin Stable At $108,000 — Market Cooling, Not Crashing In an update on X, Chad_TattoosMD also emphasized that Bitcoin is showing resilience and holding strong around the $108,000 level despite the recent dip. BTC is maintaining its structure and refusing to break lower, which is a sign of underlying buyer confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Are Betting Against the Rally, Will It Backfire? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at neutral 54, indicating no extreme momentum in either direction. Meanwhile, the Stochastic (RSI) has entered overbought territory and is now cooling off, hinting at a potential short-term pullback. However, nothing on the chart suggests a breakdown is imminent. Chad_TattoosMD also points to $106,000 as the key support, and $112,000 as the resistance, which remains in a tight zone on the chart.

Among the most talked-about opportunities for 2025 are three tokens that consistently dominate top presale lists: Solana, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE. While Solana and XRP offer proven infrastructure and institutional credibility, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s stealing the spotlight with a disruptive approach, grassroots momentum, and staggering upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Underdog with 100x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just another crypto project riding the hype wave; it’s a politically relevant, fully decentralized Layer-1 protocol designed to challenge the status quo. With a strong ideological foundation and an anti-VC stance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting thousands of retail investors seeking fairness, transparency, and the chance to back a movement rather than just a token. The numbers speak for themselves. With a planned exchange listing price of $0.007, early buyers could be looking at a potential return of 3,400% — a figure that easily competes with the best gains of the last bull run. But MAGACOIN’s strength isn’t just in hype; it lies in fundamentals. The project has passed a smart contract audit by Hashex, features zero tax on buys and sells, and allocates a full 60% of its total supply to presale participants — a rare show of commitment to community ownership. Unlike many projects that depend heavily on venture capital or centralized influencers, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building from the bottom up. Its rapidly growing community on Telegram and X reflects a new generation of investors who value utility, decentralization, and ideological alignment. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a newcomer looking for the next breakout altcoin, MAGACOIN offers a fundamentally sound entry point with real upside. Why Solana and XRP Still Make the List Solana continues to capture institutional attention with its high-speed infrastructure, low fees, and booming ecosystem. The blockchain has made headlines with the launch of staking-backed ETFs and real-world integrations from fintech giants, making it a solid pick for long-term value seekers. Its growing DeFi and NFT footprint also suggests staying power as one of the top Layer-1 platforms in the space. XRP, on the other hand, has evolved from a cross-border payments tool to a regulated crypto asset with expanding utility. With Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking charter and an upcoming stablecoin (RLUSD) in the pipeline, XRP is being repositioned as a compliant bridge currency for institutions. While not a presale token, XRP remains a must-watch for its potential to catalyze mass adoption of blockchain finance. Conclusion: MAGACOIN FINANCE Leads the Charge As the second half of 2025 unfolds, presales will remain one of the most powerful vehicles for wealth creation in crypto. However, not all tokens are built the same. Solana and XRP have earned their spots through years of development and adoption, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one project daring to rewrite the rules. With unmatched ROI potential, grassroots momentum, and a mission that resonates far beyond crypto, it’s more than a presale — it’s a movement. Investors looking for the next 100x token won’t want to overlook MAGACOIN FINANCE. It’s not just another altcoin — it’s the future of fair, community-led finance.

A strong double-bottom pattern has sparked new hope. Meanwhile, the LTC price outlook weakened after a large whale unloaded coins, putting pressure on near-term action. Both coins are now at key levels where the next move could shift the momentum fast. But the biggest attention this week is on BlockDAG (BDAG) . With $332 million already raised and 23.6 billion coins sold, BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release is now locked in at $0.0016 until August 11. It’s one of the most watched presale entries with big ROI potential in the current cycle. Its two security audits, one by CertiK and one by Halborn, and the major US sponsorship deal is adding fuel. This puts BlockDAG in the spotlight for those searching for the best altcoins of 2025. DOGE Price Prediction: Bounce Starts From Bullish Setup The DOGE price prediction is showing life again after a classic double-bottom appeared between $0.157 and $0.158. This setup, with strong volume, sparked a 2% bounce that brought DOGE back toward $0.16. If DOGE pushes through the $0.17 zone, it could break the current downtrend and confirm a reversal. For now, the DOGE price prediction depends on volume pushing past $0.17. Bitcoin’s recovery from $105,200 to $107,000 helped lift sentiment, but DOGE needs to climb above its lower high near $0.17 to really shift momentum. LTC Price Outlook: Big Sell-Off Brings Caution The LTC price outlook turned shaky after a whale sold off 340,000 LTC following a rally. Though Litecoin climbed 6% and now sits near $85, on-chain signs are pointing to more selling. Dormant wallets are active again and profit-taking is rising, which could signal more downside. Analysts are watching the Relative Strength Index, which is still under 50 and showing bearish signals. If LTC breaks above $91.61, it could run toward $96.30. But if it fails, the LTC price outlook could slide back to the $77 support zone. BlockDAG Gears Up for Launch and Big US Sponsorship Push BlockDAG isn’t just another presale on the map. It’s quickly making waves as one of the best altcoins of 2025. With $332 million already raised and 23.6 billion BDAG coins sold, the momentum keeps building. Now, talks of a major US-based sponsorship are heating up, with a deal expected to bring nationwide media reach and digital brand exposure. Most early-stage projects wait until listings for big visibility. BlockDAG is flipping that script by locking in attention before public trading begins. If the sponsorship deal moves forward, it could bring mainstream coverage across major platforms, adding fuel to the early buzz. Security is also a big part of the story. BlockDAG has completed audits from both CertiK and Halborn, two top firms in blockchain safety. This two-audit setup shows technical strength as the project heads into launch. The current price sits at just $0.0016, available until August 11’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With a confirmed launch price of $0.05, this entry opens the door to a possible 3,025% ROI. In comparison, Batch 29 was priced at $0.0276, giving a 2,660% return for early entries. That makes this moment the most rewarding point in BlockDAG’s record-setting presale so far. Where the Market Is Moving This Week The DOGE price prediction is beginning to show strength with signs of a bullish double-bottom pattern forming. On the other side, the LTC price outlook is facing pressure. Whale activity and soft technical indicators are weighing it down. Both DOGE and LTC are at key levels that could shift the short-term direction fast. BlockDAG, meanwhile, keeps picking up speed. With $332 million raised, 23.6 billion coins sold, and a locked price of $0.0016 through the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, it’s offering a chance at 3,025% ROI. Thanks to audits from both Halborn and CertiK, it’s no surprise BlockDAG is being talked about as one of the best altcoins of 2025 .

The sale is reportedly part of a plan made public earlier this year, which gives him the green light to dump up to 25 million Amazon shares through May 2026. This move follows an earlier sale in late June, where Jeff offloaded another $736.7 million in Amazon stock. He may be selling, but he’s nowhere near out. He still holds over 900 million shares, putting his Amazon stake around $200 billion. Jeff hasn’t run the company since 2021, but he’s still calling shots from the top as chairman and still holds more Amazon than anyone else alive. Jeff unloads stock after headline-making $50 million wedding Jeff’s latest cash-out came just days after his jaw-dropping $50 million wedding to Lauren Sanchez in Venice, Italy. The event pulled in an obnoxiously A-list crowd: Oprah, Bill Gates, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and a few Kardashians, because of course. It’s unclear if the wedding had anything to do with the timing of the sale, but let’s not pretend a $50 million price tag doesn’t require serious liquidity. While all this personal drama plays out, the Amazon chart is telling a different story. According to FactSet, its 50-day moving average just crossed above the 200-day, forming what’s known in technical trading as a golden cross. It’s a signal a lot of chart readers treat as bullish. The numbers are close: the 50-day sits at $206.46, just barely topping the 200-day at $206.04. But in technical analysis, that little flip matters. The sale comes while Amazon’s summer Prime Day is heating up. What used to be a one-day event now runs for four straight days, ending Friday. Analysts are keeping an eye on this, not just for sales, but for macro trends. Brian White from Monness Crespi Hardt wrote Monday that this window could be a smart time for shoppers to buy before U.S. tariffs go up in the second half of 2025. He called the sale “an opportunity” for anyone trying to dodge inflation later this year. Prime Day sale pushes Amazon stock momentum Not everyone’s just watching the charts. The beauty category is expected to dominate Prime Day, according to Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. She pointed out that beauty sales during Amazon events usually outperform. The U.S. beauty market as a whole is still growing, even if the pace is stabilizing. For Amazon, that means more transaction volume, which could feed into the momentum already building in the stock. Even after gaining more than 30% over the past three months, Amazon still trades around 8% below its intraday all-time high from early February. But with the golden cross now showing on the chart, there’s talk among technical analysts that the stock could push back up toward those highs if the current rally holds. The stock dump, the wedding, the Prime Day sales, and the golden cross? All happening in a span of weeks. The numbers are real, the filings are public, and the timing is loud. Jeff cashed out $665.8 million in July. He sold $736.7 million in June. He can still dump more through May 2026. And he’s got the SEC paperwork to keep doing it.

The U.S. president signaled plans to hike tariffs on imports, potentially as high as 50%, citing ongoing friction with the European Union over tech regulations. The rhetoric sent Asian equities lower for a third time in four sessions, pushed copper futures down in London, and dragged U.S. equity futures into the red. Yet Bitcoin remained largely unfazed, suggesting crypto investors are either discounting the macro noise or viewing BTC as increasingly insulated from global policy risk, some opined. “Bitcoin’s slight price drop from Trump's tariff plans showcases the digital asset's resilient nature and long-term investor confidence,” said Han Xu, Director at HashKey Capital, said in a Telegram message. “We’re optimistic this trend will continue even amid short-term volatility.” Still, there's clear hesitation at these levels. “Buyers are quickly letting off steam,” noted FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich. “BTC keeps getting pushed down near $110K, and while the 50-day moving average is attracting dip buyers, sellers are just as active.” He added that overall market capitalization, while still up 1.8% on the week, slipped 0.6% in the past 24 hours to $3.35 trillion, signaling another “bout of indecision” at the top. That choppiness persists even as crypto ETF inflows continue. CoinShares reported its 12th consecutive week of net inflows, with nearly $1 billion entering crypto funds last week, and over $790 million of that amount going into Bitcoin. Ether-tracked products brought in $226 million, Solana $22 million, and XRP $11 million. Total ETF assets under management have reached an all-time high of $188 billion. But under the hood, there are signs of fatigue. Bitcoin’s on-chain activity and implied volatility have dropped to their lowest in nearly two years, according to The Block. Glassnode called it a “summer lull,” pointing to collapsing trading volumes and a rising concentration of unrealized gains among long-term holders, or factors that could trigger a sharper move if sentiment turns. Despite the lack of momentum, markets remain firmly risk-on, just nervously so. “Capital continues to move away from the 200-day moving average,” Kuptsikevich added, “which shows the market still leans bullish. But any shift in tone could lead to quick profit-taking.”",Markets|Trading|Markets|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-09 03:43:26

While stalwarts like Ethereum and community-driven tokens like Shiba Inu continue to anchor many portfolios, one emerging project is commanding serious attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Here’s why this unique altcoin could be the standout play of the cycle — and how it stacks up against these other notable names. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Only Presale Grabbing Headlines as the Next Meme Giant Among all the altcoins on watchlists for 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one turning the most heads — and for good reason. While countless meme coins appear and fade, MAGACOIN is carving out a niche by blending meme culture with a powerful political narrative and genuine decentralized governance. No trading taxes: Unlike typical meme tokens that siphon value with each transaction, MAGACOIN’s zero-tax model means more of your capital stays invested — a huge advantage for long-term ROI. Audited and transparent: A Hashex audit and a fully public contract give MAGACOIN a layer of credibility most new meme coins lack. Presale demand is exploding: Thousands of investors have already jumped in, with previous stages closing faster than expected. Spots in the current round are filling rapidly, putting early movers in a position to capture the biggest gains. Top analysts are calling MAGACOIN one of the most promising meme-powered launches since the early days of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, with projections ranging from 25x to even 100x upside if momentum continues. For those who missed the earliest waves of DOGE or SHIB, this may be the closest thing to a true second chance — still early, still under the radar, but moving quickly. 2. Ethereum (ETH): The Proven Pillar for Institutional Investors Ethereum’s track record is unmatched in the crypto space. Its network underpins most DeFi, NFT, and enterprise blockchain projects. Recent developments, like the Dencun upgrade, continue to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs, ensuring Ethereum remains the backbone for decentralized applications. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Community Giant, But With Caveats Shiba Inu has evolved beyond its meme coin beginnings with the rollout of Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution designed to expand SHIB’s DeFi and metaverse use cases. The project benefits from a famously loyal community that has propelled its brand to global recognition. However, the high concentration of SHIB’s supply in a few wallets raises caution, and price moves often hinge on large holders. While it remains a favorite among retail traders chasing viral momentum, new investors might weigh this risk carefully. The Bottom Line: MAGACOIN FINANCE Offers the Most Compelling Upside Right Now For anyone scanning the crypto landscape for the best long-term ROI , it’s hard to ignore the unique position of MAGACOIN FINANCE. With no transaction taxes, a fully audited foundation, and thousands already backing it during its presale — all before it even hits major exchanges — MAGACOIN is shaping up to be the breakout story of this market cycle. Don’t wait to watch it 10x from the sidelines.

According to reporting from the Wall Street Journal, sales in Tesla’s second-largest market have dropped hard, down 30% year-over-year in May, while overall EV demand in China keeps rising. Just under 40,000 Teslas were sold last month, compared to over 57,000 during the same period a year ago. Meanwhile, companies like BYD and Xiaomi are growing fast. BYD now controls 29% of the EV and plug-in hybrid market. Tesla? Just 4%, compared to 11% in early 2021. Chinese officials once treated Elon like a national treasure. He got land, tax breaks, loans, and the rare right to build a factory without a local partner. But now, things have flipped. Tesla is falling behind the very competition it helped build. Cars from Chinese brands come loaded with features, multiple screens, in-car gaming, selfie cams, fridges, and stuff Tesla doesn’t offer. Local buyers say the brand is tired. Elon blocks feedback as Chinese team gets ignored Tesla’s team in China has tried for years to warn headquarters that local customers want new features, more smartphone integration, and native apps. In 2021, the China staff submitted a report explaining these demands. U.S. officials replied that entertainment and local integrations weren’t priorities. The same request came again in 2023 and 2024, with the same result. Tesla later added Mango TV but still offers fewer apps than domestic rivals. Meanwhile, sales staff are under pressure. A Tesla salesman in Beijing said his target jumped from four cars a week to one a day. Hours were stretched to 12 daily, up from 10. With models aging and local competition improving, workers say they’re left with less to pitch. And Tesla’s plan to build a car tailored to Chinese tastes? Scrapped. Elon changed direction, choosing instead to strip features and roll out a cheaper Model Y variant. That model starts at $36,700, while BYD’s Sealion 07 starts at $26,400. Elon’s relationship with Beijing is also deteriorating. In January, he met Vice President Han Zheng in Washington. Han reportedly told Elon that China hoped he’d help with U.S.-China relations. Elon didn’t bite. Now, officials say he’s no longer viewed as a useful bridge between the countries. At the same time, Tesla can’t roll out its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system in China. The software, live in the U.S. since early 2024, relies on AI trained from American driving data. That’s a no-go in China, where regulations require systems to be trained locally. Tesla offered to redact sensitive video, but the volume made officials uncomfortable. The company then proposed moving FSD training to China, but that plan also failed, Tesla can’t get the chips it needs due to U.S. export controls. Tesla loses tech race while rivals launch robotaxis While Elon was stuck in talks, Chinese firms charged ahead. XPeng’s XNGP and BYD’s Eyes of God launched with FSD-style capabilities. Baidu and Pony AI already operate robotaxi fleets. Tesla? Nothing. In February, the company tried sneaking in some FSD features with over-the-air updates, exploiting a gray area in regulations. Officials shut it down, clarified the rules, and blocked a free one-month trial Tesla later offered in March. Regulators said Tesla “shouldn’t use drivers as guinea pigs.” Elon’s problems don’t end with cars. In March, Tesla began shipping Megapack batteries to Australia from its new Shanghai factory. But battery giant CATL is already deep in that market. Tesla’s other gamble, humanoid robots, also depends on China. Its Optimus robot, built in the U.S., uses Chinese parts. Despite new U.S. tariffs, Tesla kept buying from its suppliers, who helped slash costs. Now, local startups like Unitree and Agibot are working with those same suppliers. “Once you secure contracts with Tesla, domestic robotics companies will be much more willing to collaborate with you,” said Chen Feng, a marketing manager at a Tesla supplier. That could put Elon right back in the same position he’s in with EVs, surrounded by competitors he accidentally helped build. During a call with analysts, Elon said, “I’m a little concerned that on the leaderboard, ranks two through 10 will be Chinese companies.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Tech|Tesla,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-09 04:02:52

The price is now showing positive signs and might climb above the $2.32 resistance. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.280 zone. The price is now trading above $2.280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $2.250 zone. XRP Price Eyes Fresh Increase XRP price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $2.2620 level, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.280 resistance level. The recent move was positive and the bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.353 swing high to the $2.251 low, and tested the $2.32 zone. Besides, there is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.320 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.330 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.353 swing high to the $2.251 low. A clear move above the $2.330 resistance might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.40 resistance or even $2.420 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near the $2.50 zone. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.320 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.280 level and the trend line zone. The next major support is near the $2.250 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.250 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.220 support. The next major support sits near the $2.20 zone.

The proposed investment trust will primarily hold Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , Ripple (XRP) , and Cronos (CRO) , the native token of the Cronos blockchain, which is associated with the Crypto.com exchange. The SEC has acknowledged the filing, which means it’s now under review, according to a July 8 SEC submission. Source: Sec.gov Truth Social ETF Portfolio Structure and Crypto.com partnership The ETF portfolio will maintain a composition of approximately 70% Bitcoin , 15% Ethereum , 8% Solana , 5% Cronos , and 2% XRP by value. Upon approval, the ETF will be listed and traded on NYSE Arca, though the fund’s ticker symbol remains undisclosed. ""the Trust’s allocation of its assets to the Portfolio Assets (the “allocation ratio”) is initially expected to approximate percentages by value of 70% bitcoin, 15% ether, 8% SOL, 5% CRO and 2% XRP."" — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 8, 2025 The proposed ETF is expected to function as a passive investment vehicle, tracking the market prices of its underlying cryptocurrencies without employing leverage, derivatives, or speculative trading strategies. The fund will also engage in staking for assets such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cronos, allowing it to generate staking rewards. Truth Social previously filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June, followed by a submission for a Bitcoin and Ethereum combination ETF. Similar to those registration statements, the “Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF” is sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, while Foris DAX Trust Company will be serving as custodian for digital assets, according to the filing. Additionally, Crypto.com will act as the ETF’s exclusive Bitcoin custodian, prime execution agent, and liquidity provider. Earlier reports indicated a TMTG partnership with Singapore-based Crypto.com to launch “Made-in-America” ETFs. The media platform signed a non-binding agreement to offer a series of exchange-traded products (ETPs) and funds (ETFs) on the Cronos blockchain-owned exchange. The inclusion of CRO in the investable ETFs appears to confirm Crypto.com’s involvement in the venture. Notably, the news of the recent filing had a notably greater impact on CRO than on other Truth Social blue-chip cryptocurrencies. The asset surged more than 20% to a monthly high of $0.09886, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana only experienced gains between 1.08% and 3.6% during the same period. Source: Coingecko TMTG’s Broader Digital Asset Strategy Amid President Trump’s Growing Crypto Fortune The SEC’s potential approval follows the confirmation by Truth Social’s parent company of its digital asset strategy, which includes a Bitcoin treasury plan. On May 30, the company announced it had raised $2.44 billion through a private placement involving nearly 50 institutional investors. The SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement linked to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. #Trump #TruthSocial https://t.co/ybidUAZtqb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 14, 2025 The funding round included 55.9 million shares at $25.72 and $1 billion in zero-coupon convertible notes, with proceeds designated for Bitcoin acquisition and general operations. In a May 27 announcement, TMTG President and CEO Devin Nunes described Bitcoin as “an apex instrument of financial freedom,” stating that it would become a core component of the company’s asset base. On the same day, Arkham Intelligence posted on X: “Donald Trump’s company, Trump Media, will buy $2.5 BILLION of Bitcoin. Is Trump about to go Saylor Mode?”, referencing MicroStrategy’s executive chairman and his aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Moreover, President Trump appears to be benefiting significantly from these cryptocurrency ventures. A July 2 Bloomberg report revealed that Trump and his family have reportedly earned over $620 million from recent cryptocurrency ventures, with Trump’s exclusive crypto holdings now comprising around 9% of his estimated $6 billion fortune as of June.

In his Tuesday post, Musk bashed the government for failing to take action against people on the Epstein client list , including a meme mocking the justice system. The meme insinuated that more squirrels and raccoons than Epstein’s affiliates have been apprehended. Crypto traders tied Musk’s post to Solana’s PNUT token Musk also mentioned a squirrel named Peanut, who was “arrested (and killed), in his post. While he didn’t name the PNUT token explicitly, the timing of his post coincided with a spike in the coin’s price and trading activity. Source: CoinMarketCap He wrote, “They arrested (and killed) Peanut but have not even tried to file charges against anyone on the Epstein client list. Government is deeply broken.” So far, the post has over 13.7 million views, earning nearly 45% of the views in just a few hours. Crypto investors seem to have associated his post with the Solana meme coin. After his post, the PNUT token surged 10% to $0.2357. The asset’s 24-hour trading volume also grew 80%, crossing $214 million. Currently, the meme coin has a market cap of $223 million, trading at $0.2257. Musk’s past posts have fueled crypto price rallies This is not the first time Musk’s posts have driven price rallies for crypto assets. In January, he changed his handle on X to “Kekius Maximus” and profile picture to show “Pepe the Frog” in Roman military attire, holding a video game joystick. After his alteration, the Kekius Maximus token surged over 900% . In 2021, Musk wrote, “The Dogefather SNL May 8” in one of his posts, and Dogecoin, a popular meme coin, rose over 20% in 24 hours. Then again, in 2024, he posted an AI image related to the token, causing another price rise for the token by about 8%. Additionally, in January 2021, he changed his bio on the platform to #bitcoin. Soon after, Bitcoin’s price jumped from roughly $32,000 to more than $38,000, adding $111 billion to its market cap. Moreover, the Ethereum-based meme coin Floki rose 418% after the billionaire posted a picture of his dog named Floki in 2023. Judging from history, Musk’s meme and crypto-related posts, no matter how subtle, tend to spark swift reactions in the crypto market. In this case, a satirical political reference propelled a Solana meme token upward, but whether the token can grow more hinges on future hype and traction. Musk is hoping to establish a new political party Meanwhile, the billionaire is focused on building a third party that could rival the Republican and Democratic parties. Following his fallout with President Trump over the ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ Musk disclosed the birth of the American Party. He’s touted the new party as tech-driven, fiscally responsible, energy-friendly, and politically centrist, aiming to attract both Democrats and Republicans alike. However, experts have warned that disbanding the grip of the traditional parties demands significant funding and long-term dedication. They noted how previous attempts failed, especially since elections in the country are at a state-by-state level. However, some are optimistic that Musk could pull through with his new party, including David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida. Jolly believes the challenge in forming a new party is having resources, noting that Musk could provide that. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

While the analysis noted that Bitcoin has formed a strong structure in recent weeks, it was claimed that a breakout in the short term could determine the direction. According to MakroVision’s technical analysis, Bitcoin price is currently approaching the red trend line that has been acting as a strong resistance for weeks. Above this level, there is a high amount of liquidity in the $111,000–$112,000 range. Related News: The Hidden Danger in the Cryptocurrency World: Could This be the Second Terra (LUNA) Incident? On the support side, two main areas stand out: The $106,400–$107,400 range is being watched as short-term support. The $105,000–$102,000 band below this level is defined as a larger demand zone. MakroVision states that if Bitcoin achieves a permanent break above the $110,000 level, a new upward momentum may begin. However, in case of a rejection from this level, the reaction of the price and whether the support zones can be maintained will be decisive in terms of the direction of the market. *This is not investment advice.

For the first time, anyone across the globe can hold US dollars via stablecoins, which will drive demand, in turn benefiting Ethereum. The Primary Settlement Layer Despite talk of “de-dollarization,” the global demand for US dollars is booming, especially via stablecoins , which now exceed $260 billion in total market capitalization. This is unlocking dollar access for billions, especially in emerging markets. More than four billion people and millions of businesses are actively seeking dollar access through stablecoins, the researchers noted. Stablecoins are spreading the dollar faster than any financial tech in history. And Ethereum is becoming the financial backbone. For Ethereum’s 10th birthday, we’re publishing our updated @ElectricCapital ETH thesis: Remaking the Case for ETH 1/ pic.twitter.com/Rr9mSrK0GS — mariaa.eth (@MariaShen) July 8, 2025 However, this burgeoning market of new dollar holders wants more than just digital cash. They need yields , investment opportunities, and financial services, and traditional finance, such as banks, cannot serve this massive new market due to regulatory, financial, geofencing, and infrastructure constraints. “Ethereum is uniquely positioned to host the global financial infrastructure for this new digital dollar economy, and ETH stands to benefit directly from this growth.” Ethereum is already primed for this position because it is globally accessible, institution-grade secure, and resistant to government interference. Additionally, Ethereum is already the primary settlement layer, underpinning the largest on-chain economy with more than $140 billion in stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets and $60 billion in DeFi. As a result, Ethereum will become to the on-chain dollar economy what Treasuries and gold are to traditional finance – a reserve and trust anchor. As stablecoin usage expands, a flywheel effect will be generated as more ETH is needed as collateral for DeFi and real-world finance, more ETH is staked, securing the network and reducing supply, and more institutional capital flows in , as the asset offers regulatory clarity and composability. No Real Competition There is no real competition at the moment because Bitcoin lacks programmability and adoption as a financial platform, and other blockchains lack Ethereum’s security, decentralization, and institutional credibility, they said. Additionally, traditional finance is geographically and regulatorily siloed and unable to serve the global demand unlocked by stablecoins. Anyone who has tried to open a bank account in a particular country without a physical address there would concur. “We’ve believed in programmable money since 2018. We made the institutional case for Bitcoin at our founding. Now we’re doing the same for Ethereum,” said Shen in conclusion.

The board has approved a phased investment of up to $100 million in Ethereum (ETH), marking a bold shift in its treasury strategy. To kick things off, the company priced a public offering of 8.42 million shares at $0.95, raising $8 million. The bulk of this funding will go toward launching the new ETH-based treasury vehicle. Following the news, the Ethereum price has climbed to $2,606.26, marking a 2.69% gain in the past 24 hours as market sentiment turns bullish. Wall Street moves deeper into crypto GameSquare Holdings ( $GAME ) just announced a $100M Ethereum treasury strategy, aiming to generate 8–14% yield on-chain. • Backed by a strategic alliance with Dialectic, one of the world’s top crypto investment firms • Capital will be… pic.twitter.com/EFI0PaSGFw — Swingly (@SwinglyHQ) July 8, 2025 Partnering with Dialectic for On-Chain Yield At the heart of the strategy is a partnership with Dialectic, a well-known crypto investment firm led by Ryan Zurrer. GameSquare will use Dialectic’s Medici platform, which applies machine learning and risk controls to target yields between 8% and 14%, well above the typical 3–4% ETH staking rate. This positions GameSquare to generate real, on-chain revenue rather than simply holding crypto. More Than Just ETH—A Diversified Approach The strategy won’t stop at Ethereum. GameSquare plans to explore other yield opportunities in the broader ETH ecosystem, including stablecoins and NFTs. This diversified model is designed to maximize returns while spreading risk. The board-approved $100 million will be deployed in stages, ensuring the company maintains enough capital for operations. CEO Justin Kenna said the new crypto strategy is part of a long-term plan to build financial resilience. Yield generated from Ethereum will support further ETH purchases, share buybacks, and core business reinvestment. This reflects a growing trend of traditional firms adopting digital assets not just for speculation, but for operational value. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : DeFi Dev Corp Acquires Additional 47.2k Solana: What Next for SOL Price? , Ethereum Market reaction GameSquare’s bold $100 million Ethereum treasury move is already stirring strong reactions across the crypto space. Investors are taking notice, especially after Bit Digital’s recent shift of its entire treasury to ETH caused its shares to surge nearly 20%, signaling growing confidence in Ethereum-based strategies. On X, analyst TylerD called out the GameSquare deal as a potential game-changer, pointing to the scale of investment as a rare corporate-level commitment to crypto. Many in the community see this as part of a broader trend, where institutions are gradually adopting Ethereum not just as a speculative asset but as a core financial tool. What It Means for Investors GameSquare’s move shows confidence in the future of decentralized finance. It’s also one of the more structured and institutional ETH plays we’ve seen from a media-tech firm. With strong partners and a phased plan, GameSquare is betting on Ethereum not just as an asset, but as an engine for growth. According to market data, GameSquare (GAME) rose by more than 58.76% yesterday, with a trading volume of $40.31 million. The current after-hours rise has exceeded the US stock market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

On February 21, the global crypto exchange Bybit suffered a record-setting $1.4 billion hack, marking the largest single-theft event in crypto history. This attack, reportedly attributed to the Lazarus Group, highlighted persistent industry-wide vulnerabilities concerning advanced attack methodologies, systemic weaknesses, and inadequate cross-platform risk management frameworks. In response to these critical events, HTX reaffirmed its commitment to robust security by substantially increasing its investment. Through enhanced risk management protocols, strengthened operational security, and advanced intelligence capabilities, HTX has achieved comprehensive protection across accounts, trading, and assets. These proactive measures have successfully mitigated several high-risk threats, thereby safeguarding user assets and reinforcing trust within the HTX ecosystem. Crypto Industry Faces Evolving Security Challenges The crypto industry is experiencing a surge in the frequency and sophistication of threats, including hacks, scams, and malicious on-chain behaviors. The threat landscape has evolved from isolated phishing to multi-vector attacks, such as social engineering attacks, malicious contract deployment, UI spoofing, and deepfake deception. These tactics often exploit vulnerabilities between platform security systems. The first half of 2025 witnessed the Bybit hack and a string of protocol breaches on Solana, demonstrating a trend toward increasingly automated and professionally orchestrated attacks. At the same time, global regulators are tightening compliance expectations. Many jurisdictions have introduced regulatory frameworks for virtual asset service providers, mandating adherence with anti-money laundering regulations, enhanced account protection, and stringent risk management and auditing practices. This raises the bar for industry-wide security and compliance. On a positive note, core defense technologies such as on-chain traceability, AI-powered risk engines, and automated contract audits are becoming essential across major platforms, enhancing readiness and risk intelligence. HTX Mid-Year Security Highlights: Enhanced Protection & User Safeguards Over the past half-year, HTX’s security efforts have delivered meaningful results across multiple verticals: Account Security: Over 2.01 million security alerts were sent to users including 1.809M via email and 206k via SMS, greatly improving users’ security awareness. Additionally, 127 fake download pages and phishing domains were dismantled. Trading Security: 15 withdrawal attempts to scam addresses were blocked, which successfully recovered 104,847 USDT in potential user losses. Moreover, the platform handled 68 reports involving external stolen assets, leading to the freezing of 1,429,787 USDT in compromised funds. Asset Security: 20,871 malicious wallet addresses were added to HTX’s blacklist; 47 deposits from flagged addresses were intercepted. A total of 1,449,467 USDT assets were involved. In June alone HTX blocked 5 scam-related withdrawals, froze over $400,000 in compromised funds for other platform users, added 2,769 new blacklisted addresses with 21,239 USDT worth of fraudulent deposits prevented, and took down 41 new phishing domains. Security Infrastructure: New Systems. New Tech. New Paradigm. In 2025, HTX continued its transition toward a multi-layered security model, introducing critical upgrades across its three core protection pillars: Risk Management Architecture: HTX developed an in-house millisecond-level real-time risk engine that monitors every user interaction. Every high-risk behavior is dynamically filtered to mitigate account compromise, money laundering, and malicious activity. 24/7 Operational Security: HTX’s dedicated security operations and customer support teams operate on a round-the-clock cycle, enabling real-time response and full-cycle risk resolution. Threat Intelligence: HTX partners with top security firms, project teams, and other exchanges to maintain a real-time threat map. This collaboration accelerates cross-platform incident response, dark web surveillance, and hacker attribution. HTX’s comprehensive security system significantly reduces user vulnerability. Account security is enhanced through multi-factor authentication, behavioral biometrics, dynamic risk assessment, and collaboration with security agencies to eliminate phishing sites. Assets security leverages a million-level blacklist, partnerships with anti-money laundering organizations, on-chain tracking, and risk models to identify and prevent suspicious transactions. In terms of robust information security, the platform takes a string of measures, including a financial-grade security system and strict internal controls, to protect user data. Furthermore, HTX upgraded its PoR data storage to TiDB, improving system stability and efficiency, while reducing operational and maintenance costs. This contributed to substantial growth in overall user assets and a steady increase in core reserves during the first half of 2025, with continuous net growth in cryptocurrencies like USDT and ETH, demonstrating growing user trust. Building a Trust-Centric, Resilient Crypto Ecosystem Looking ahead, HTX is committed to accelerating its security infrastructure investment. This commitment not only protects users but also aims to shape the future of a safer, more resilient crypto industry. As one HTX security expert put it, “From the glaringly apparent challenges to cryptocurrency security in 2024 to the $1.44 billion Bybit exploit this year, we can tell that attacks have evolved from code exploits to targeting human weaknesses. Therefore, we’ve enhanced the integration of behavioral analytics and zero-trust architecture and brought three key upgrades to life: dynamic permission validation, end-to-end transaction authentication, and continuous red-blue team threat simulation. These aren’t just upgrades but are foundational steps toward long-term user protection and ecosystem synergy.” l Dynamic Permission Verification: At HTX, every fund operation now requires dual authentication, combining environment tagging with biometric validation. This ensures actions align with both the user and their operating environment. l End-to-End Transaction Authentication: By validating transaction payloads at the smart contract level, HTX eliminates risks from compromised UIs, closing the gap on deceptive front-end manipulation. l Always-On Red-Blue Simulation: Monthly, HTX’s security team simulates real-world attacks from top APT groups and hackers, constantly stress-testing the platform’s defenses and closing the loop between offense and response. HTX firmly believes that only a deeply integrated, multi-dimensional security architecture — coupled with a transparent, collaborative approach — can serve as the foundation for long-term user trust. As the threat landscape grows more complex, HTX will continue investing heavily in security innovation and infrastructure. Its mission is to not only defend against emerging threats, but to lead the crypto industry into a future that’s safer, smarter, and more sustainable for millions worldwide. About HTX Founded in 2013, HTX has evolved from a virtual asset exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, research, investments, incubation, and other businesses. As a world-leading gateway to Web3, HTX harbors global capabilities that enable it to provide users with safe and reliable services.

On the weekly chart, the asset is coiling tightly near a defined demand zone between $1.61 and $1.98, while pressing against a descending trendline that has contained price since early 2025. This setup signals a potential breakout just as the U.S. Federal Reserve prepares to upgrade its FedWire Funds Service to the ISO 20022 standard on July 14, 2025. This timing has not gone unnoticed by analysts. X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull), a crypto commentator on X, highlighted that the digital asset’s structure is “aligning with history in real time.” The chart he shared shows XRP nearing the apex of its multi-month consolidation, stating that “he rails are syncing with the narrative” as ISO 20022 goes live. As technical pressure builds, one of the most important infrastructure changes in U.S. finance is set to take effect, and XRP could experience the breakout to a new all-time high that analysts have been anticipating. $XRP chart is aligning with history in real time Price coiling at demand while ISO 20022 goes live? That’s not a coincidence, that’s the rails syncing with the narrative. Next move could melt faces. You positioned? pic.twitter.com/IK6QdqgyTh — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) July 7, 2025 FedWire’s ISO 20022 Transition and Its Implications The Federal Reserve has confirmed that on July 14, 2025, all payments through the FedWire Funds Service will switch to the ISO 20022 format . This marks the end of the current FAIM-based messaging system and the beginning of a new phase of structured, data-rich financial communication within the U.S. high-value payment system. FedWire’s adoption marks a significant milestone in the broader integration of ISO 20022 in global finance. It also strengthens the case for ISO-compliant systems , and XRP could potentially gain further relevance in institutional payment flows because of Ripple’s alignment with ISO 20022 standards. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Tightening Price Structure Suggests Impending Breakout XRP’s current price, around $2.28, is compressed within a descending triangle pattern that began after its rally in late 2024. Despite multiple tests of the support and resistance boundaries, the price remains tightly bound. This is often a precursor to increased volatility, especially when broader infrastructure or policy changes are on the horizon. X Finance Bull highlighted $11.33 and $14.48 as potential targets on the chart. However, other experts have predicted that the FedWire transition could send XRP to $25 . These targets may come into play only if XRP decisively breaks out from its current structure with strong volume and confirmation. For now, the focus remains on whether price can close above the trendline as the July FedWire milestone approaches.

Pi Network risks falling below $0.40 if stagnation continues. However, if the Pi Core Team implements just two of these 11 strategic actions, the community could regain confidence, and the price may recover steadily. Key suggestions include launching DAO governance, burning unclaimed tokens, forming partnerships with firms like OpenAI or Binance Cloud, and enabling cross-chain compatibility with Ethereum or BNB. Other actions like mass KYC rollout, introducing DeFi features, reviving node rewards, and funding developers through a Pi Launchpad could significantly boost utility and demand. July 9, 2025 05:26:21 UTC Pi Network Leads the Way With $16 Trillion AI Revolution AI is set to add $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and Pi Network is at the forefront in crypto. As the first major blockchain integrating AI, Pi’s App Studio lets users build AI-powered dApps without coding. From smart assistants to AI-driven tools, Pi is creating real-world utility. If Pi captures just 1% of the AI boom, that’s a $160B opportunity. More than crypto, Pi empowers people to own and benefit from AI innovation. The future isn’t coming, Pi is building it, block by block. July 7, 2025 12:21:59 UTC Pi Network Unlock Schedule Alert Between June 28 and July 15, 2025, the Pi Network saw the unlocking of over 250 million $PI tokens, valued at more than $135 million. These massive daily releases are creating significant sell pressure in the market. As more tokens flood into circulation, volatility is expected to rise. Pioneers should stay alert and closely monitor price movements. July 7, 2025 12:21:59 UTC Is Pi Network at Risk of a Decline? Pi Network is hovering around $0.477, but storm clouds may be forming. With over 300 million tokens set to unlock next month, sell pressure could spike. If Pi fails to hold the $0.477 level, it risks dropping back to its previous bottom near $0.40. Investors should watch this key support zone closely. July 7, 2025 12:19:36 UTC Pi Network Price in India The current Pi Network (PI) price on July 7, 2025, is around ₹39.82–₹41.07 per coin. The 24-hour trading volume is approximately $80–92 million, showing strong interest and liquidity. PI’s market cap stands near $3.5 billion. The coin saw a 4% price rise today, but remains volatile. July 7, 2025 12:08:21 UTC Pi Ecosystem Expands Rapidly with Over 10,000 Apps The Pi Network ecosystem is witnessing rapid growth, with the number of applications reaching 10,580 as of July 7. This surge highlights increasing developer interest and user adoption. Meanwhile, global banks and financial institutions are accelerating their integration into the Pi ecosystem. With its expanding Web3 infrastructure, Pi is steadily positioning itself as a global decentralized network. July 7, 2025 12:08:21 UTC Pi Network Price Faces Critical Phase Pi Network may be entering its most dangerous phase yet. Despite bullish news like AI partnerships and new apps, $Pi’s price remains stagnant. A massive 276 million token unlock this July could trigger $127M in sell pressure. The core team’s silence, stalled KYC, and falling on-chain activity are alarming. With top influencers quiet and community engagement dropping, trust is fading fast. While Bitcoin and Ethereum soar, Pi continues to lag. These aren’t just slowdowns they may signal a deeper crisis. Pioneers should prepare wisely and not rely on blind faith as pressure builds. July 7, 2025 12:08:21 UTC Pi Network Event in India The Pi Network GCV $314,159 event is happening on July 27, 2025, in Tinsukia, Assam, hosted by the PI GCV Warriors of Assam.

Michael Shannon Sims, a founder and promoter of OmegaPro, and Juan Carlos Reynoso, who led OmegaPro’s operations in Latin America and some parts of the U.S., were charged on conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, according to documents published on Tuesday. OmegaPro was an international investment scheme, which collapsed in 2022. In 2024, Andreas Szakacs, the co-founder of the scheme, was arrested in Turkey in his involvement with OmegaPro. “As alleged, the defendants preyed upon vulnerable individuals in the U.S. and abroad, defrauding them of over $650 million by making false promises of substantial returns and that their money was safe,” said Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the justice department’s criminal division. OmegaPro was established in early 2019, by Sims and others. According to the document, the defendants and others promised investors 300% return over 16 months through foreign exchange trading. Investors were instructed to purchase these investment packages using crypto.

Remixpoint already holds an impressive digital asset portfolio, including over 1,051 BTC. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet intensified its Bitcoin accumulation, and now holds 15,555 BTC with plans to reach 1% of all Bitcoin in existence by 2027. CEO Simon Gerovich envisions using BTC as collateral to fund acquisitions like a digital bank. At the same time, VC firm Ego Death Capital raised $100 million to back Bitcoin-only startups. Takashi Tashiro Accepts Bitcoin Salary Takashi Tashiro, the newly appointed CEO of Tokyo-based energy firm Remixpoint, will receive his salary in Bitcoin, according to a company statement that was released on Tuesday. The company explained that the move aligns with its goal of “shareholder-oriented management” and reflects Tashiro’s commitment to being “in the same boat” as shareholders. Remixpoint said the payment will be calculated in Japanese yen, and once taxes and remuneration are finalized, the equivalent amount in Bitcoin will be purchased and sent to a crypto wallet designated by Tashiro. Statement from Remixpoint Tashiro stepped into the CEO role in June, and stated that Bitcoin will be central to the company’s financial strategy as it pivots toward a treasury management focus. Even before his appointment, Remixpoint was accumulating a large digital asset portfolio. As of June 13, the company held more than 1,051 BTC, 901 ETH, 13,920 SOL, over 1.19 million XRP, and nearly 2.8 million DOGE, with a total market value exceeding $116 million. Takashi Tashiro In addition to leading Remixpoint, Tashiro is also affiliated with BITPoint, a crypto exchange tied to the SBI Group. The exchange recently attracted some attention for promoting the Trump-themed meme coin “Official Trump.” Remixpoint is not the first company to compensate its executives in cryptocurrency. In 2021, Argo Blockchain’s then-CEO Peter Wall opted to receive his salary in Bitcoin after being inspired by NFL player Russell Okung, who converted a portion of his income to crypto in 2020. Similarly, New York City Mayor Eric Adams accepted his first three paychecks in Bitcoin after his 2021 election campaign. Adams frequently boasted about the growth of his crypto holdings, especially since Bitcoin’s price has more than doubled since he first decided to embrace it. Metaplanet Plans Bitcoin-Backed Expansion Another Japanese firm is also grabbing the attention of the crypto space. Metaplanet is continuing its bold strategy of accumulating Bitcoin with the intention of using it as a financial asset to acquire revenue-generating businesses, including the potential purchase of a digital bank in Japan. In an interview with the Financial Times, CEO Simon Gerovich revealed that the company’s long-term vision is to transform its Bitcoin reserves into leverage for future expansion. He described the firm’s strategy as a “Bitcoin gold rush,” due to the urgency to accumulate as much BTC as possible before others can catch up. Gerovich is very confident that once Metaplanet reaches a critical mass of Bitcoin holdings, it will become increasingly difficult for competitors to rival its position. Metaplanet began buying Bitcoin in 2024 as a hedge against inflation. Since then, it has dramatically shifted its business model and now holds 15,555 BTC. The company plans to increase this number to over 210,000 BTC by 2027, which would amount to 1% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. Gerovich said that once Metaplanet reaches sufficient holdings, it will begin using Bitcoin as collateral to access financing. He even compared it to how companies use traditional securities or government bonds. The plan is to convert this financial flexibility into acquisitions of cash-generating assets, with a strong preference for businesses aligned with its digital-first vision. One of the main targets under consideration is a digital bank in Japan, which would allow Metaplanet to provide next-generation financial services better than current retail offerings. Although crypto-backed lending is still rare in conventional finance, institutional players are slowly entering the space. Standard Chartered and OKX recently piloted a program for institutional crypto collateral. Gerovich stated that Metaplanet will not pursue convertible debt to fund its acquisitions but would consider issuing preferred shares to avoid repayment obligations tied to volatile share prices. On Monday, the company resumed its aggressive buying spree by adding 2,204 BTC for $237 million at an average price of about $107,700 per coin. This raised its total holdings to 15,555 BTC , with an average purchase cost of $99,985 per Bitcoin. Despite limited revenue, Metaplanet’s stock soared more than 330% in 2025, pushing its market capitalization beyond $7 billion. The company’s approach is very similar to that of MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which now holds over 597,000 BTC and has a market cap of $112 billion. Top public Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) VC Firm Backs Bitcoin-Only Startups Meanwhile, venture capital firm Ego Death Capital secured $100 million in funding from family offices and other investors to support early-stage Bitcoin companies. The firm plans to allocate the funds to Series A rounds for startups generating between $1 million and $3 million in annual revenue, according to founding partner Nico Leshuga. Speaking to Axios , Leshuga shared his strong conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a foundational technology, and described it as “the only decentralized and secure base to be able to build on.” Ego Death Capital’s strategic focus comes during a wave of institutional enthusiasm for Bitcoin, fueled by the strong performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States and the growth of corporate Bitcoin treasuries. The firm already invested in several Bitcoin-native startups, including Roxcom, a Bitcoin exchange; Relai, a savings platform; and Breez, a payment app built on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. However, the firm drew a firm line on the scope of its investments. It does not plan to back hardware-oriented companies like miners or wallet manufacturers, nor is it interested in any projects involving other cryptocurrencies. This narrow focus distinguishes Ego Death Capital from other crypto venture firms. The timing of Ego Death’s new fund coincides with a rebound in venture capital funding in the crypto and blockchain space. According to CryptoRank , the second quarter saw a sharp uptick in funding, with a total of $10.03 billion raised. Over half of that, $5.14 billion, came in June alone. Among the standout deals were Vivek Ramaswamy’s $750 million Strive fundraise and the launch of 21 Capital, which raised $585 million for Bitcoin acquisitions. (Source: CryptoRank ) This resurgence was the strongest quarter for crypto venture capital since the first quarter of 2022, when investment levels reached $16.64 billion. Ego Death Capital’s focused strategy in this specific growing landscape means that it has a deepening belief that Bitcoin is not just a store of value, but a foundational platform for the next wave of innovation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-09 05:30:00

Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 Arthur Britto, who co‑founded Ripple Labs in 2012, broke a 14‑year silence with a single emoji on X. That tiny message carried big weight. His name rarely surfaces in headlines, but his work helped build XRP into one of the top assets by market value. Impact Of A Secretive Founder According to reports, Britto kept a low profile while helping craft the XRP Ledger’s code. He holds a 2% stake in XRP under a deal made when the company launched. That slice of holdings could be worth billions if the token’s price ever climbed high enough. Some in the market worry that if Britto ever sold even part of that stake, it might send prices tumbling. 🚨⚠️ HE CO-CREATED THE XRP LEDGER. HE HOLDS 2% OF ALL XRP. HE’S NEVER BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC. Arthur Britto might be the most important figure in crypto you’ve never heard of. Let’s dive into the mystery.🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/xKyiYXIpGY — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) July 5, 2025 The Satoshi Connection Based on reports, comparisons to Bitcoin’s creator have swirled around Britto for years. Some fans point to the fact that Satoshi Nakamoto’s last known post came just as the XRP Ledger went live. That timing alone has led people to whisper that Britto could be Satoshi under a different name. No proof supports that idea. Experts say it’s more likely just a coincidence. Britto’s lone emoji on X was verified by Ripple CTO David Schwartz. That confirmation set off a wave of theories about what might come next. Some speculated a new protocol update. Others thought it hinted at a partnership or a fresh product launch. So far, nothing public has followed the post. Behind The Scenes At PolySign While he stayed away from interviews, Britto never stopped working. He co‑founded PolySign, a crypto custody firm that now operates under Ripple Custody. That arm provides secure storage for institutions holding digital coins. Based on filings, PolySign handled an estimated $1.5 billion in assets last year. Its integration into Ripple’s services shows Britto’s influence lives on, even if his name doesn’t show up on conference schedules. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $6 Billion In Tokenized Funds As Big Players Jump In Future Moves And Market Watch With XRP trading near its recent range, some investors say they’re watching for any hint of action from Britto’s wallet. Price targets in the community sometimes stretch to $10,000 per XRP. Those figures come without verification, and many traders treat them as wishful thinking. Still, a lot can happen if even a fraction of Britto’s holdings moves.

33767162,[object Object],1752039037,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Volatility Hits Bull Cycle Low – Bollinger Bands Signal Potential Breakout,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-volatility-hits-bull-cycle-low-bollinger-bands-signal-potential-breakout/,"Bitcoin has remained in a tight consolidation range below its all-time high of $112,000 since late May, frustrating both bulls and bears. Despite multiple failed breakout attempts, BTC has held key demand zones above critical support levels, suggesting strong underlying strength. As price compresses, volatility is declining — a classic sign that a major move could be imminent. Top analyst Axel Adler shared fresh data indicating that Bitcoin is currently experiencing a textbook Bollinger Bands squeeze. The spread between the upper and lower bands has narrowed to just 7.7%, marking one of the tightest ranges seen throughout the current bull cycle. Historically, such compressions have preceded explosive moves in either direction. Given Bitcoin’s position above support and within a broader uptrend, the probability favors an upside breakout. This technical setup, combined with macroeconomic tailwinds and renewed investor interest, could serve as the catalyst for BTC to finally push into price discovery . If confirmed, it would not only open the door for a run beyond $112K but also reset expectations across the crypto market. In the coming days, all eyes will be on how Bitcoin responds to this mounting pressure. Bitcoin Consolidates As Bollinger Bands Squeeze Signals Next Move Bitcoin continues to consolidate just below its all-time high of $112,000, frustrating bulls and bears alike. Despite ongoing resistance at the top, bears have failed to drive the price below $105,000, confirming strong demand at key support levels. As the price tightens, the broader macroeconomic picture adds complexity to the outlook. The US Congress recently passed President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” economic bill just before the July 4 deadline. The package includes tax cuts and aggressive public spending, which are expected to fuel inflation in the coming quarters. Coupled with optimistic job data, these developments are shaping investor sentiment across traditional and crypto markets. On the technical side , Axel Adler highlighted a classic Bollinger Bands squeeze currently forming on Bitcoin’s chart. The range between the upper and lower bands has compressed to just 7.7%—one of the tightest readings seen throughout the ongoing bull cycle. This kind of volatility drop suggests energy accumulation, with the price preparing for a significant move. Historical patterns offer insight: of six major Bollinger Band squeezes this cycle, four resulted in immediate upside moves, and two triggered brief corrections before rallies resumed. With this precedent, Adler believes the current setup most likely foreshadows a bullish breakout, although minor consolidation beforehand is still possible. BTC Price Holds Above Key Moving Averages The 12-hour Bitcoin chart shows BTC trading at $108,892, struggling to break above the key resistance zone around $109,300. This level has acted as a rejection point multiple times since early June, confirming its strength. Despite the recent pullback, price remains above the 50 SMA ($106,442) and 100 SMA ($106,671), indicating bullish momentum is still in play. Importantly, bulls have defended the $106,000–$107,000 support range several times, preventing deeper corrections and keeping BTC within a tight consolidation range. Volume has declined in recent sessions, suggesting the market is waiting for a catalyst to break out of this range. If Bitcoin closes decisively above $109,300 on strong volume, a run toward the $112,000 all-time high becomes increasingly likely. On the downside, a break below the 100 SMA could expose BTC to the next major support around $103,600, a key level that has held since mid-May. The 200 SMA (currently at $99,093) remains a long-term support zone that hasn’t been tested in months.

The Analyst is NO,https://timestabloid.com/is-magacoin-finance-a-scam-the-analyst-is-no/,"In today’s rapidly evolving digital asset space, due diligence is everything. With thousands of cryptocurrencies launching each year, investors are right to ask questions, dig deeper, and seek clarity before making decisions. One question that often emerges about rising stars in the market is: Is MAGACOIN FINANCE a scam? The answer is a confident and professional no — and here’s why that conclusion is backed by serious insights, not speculation. Expert Perspective: What Defines Legitimacy in Crypto? To assess the legitimacy of any cryptocurrency project, analysts use a well-defined framework based on: Transparency of the team and project goals Smart contract verification and security audits Utility and long-term vision Community trust and organic growth Track record of performance and consistency MAGACOIN FINANCE meets — and in many ways exceeds — these industry standards. Transparent Vision, Clear Communication A legitimate project always begins with clarity. MAGACOIN FINANCE has laid out a clear mission , backed by a passionate team that emphasizes patriotic values, decentralized ownership, and broad appeal. Their official channels, including their website and social platforms , offer straightforward, jargon-free explanations of their objectives, how the tokenomics work, and where the project is heading next.

This transparency removes any mystery about what the code does and ensures that it functions as promised. Furthermore, early feedback from the broader development community and blockchain auditors has shown no red flags .

His testimony emphasizes that XRP is not a security, Ripple holds over 60 global licenses, and U.S. crypto policy is forcing innovation offshore. With the hearing titled “From Wall Street to Web3,” Garlinghouse urges Congress to act, stating, “Money should move like information and XRP is the key.” This marks a major turning point for Ripple, placing XRP at the center of crypto legislation debates. July 9, 2025 05:39:39 UTC XRP Price Could Soar if SEC Ends Ripple Case This Saturday Speculation is mounting that the SEC could announce the end of its case against Ripple this Saturday. If that happens, analysts believe it could signal a coordinated shift, including Fedwire adopting Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) alongside ISO20022 standards. Such a move would align the U.S. financial infrastructure with blockchain-based systems, potentially positioning XRP at the core.

The move could legitimize XRP on Wall Street, offering institutional access and reshaping its narrative.

On the other hand, if the market is hit again by external forces like regulations or negative statements by influencers. Hence, the meme coin might trade at a potential low of $ 0.62 . We expect the DOGE price to reach a new swing high of $1.07 by the end of 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.62 $0.84 $1.07 DOGE Price Analysis July 2025 Dogecoin may have started 2025 on the back foot, but with growing optimism surrounding a potential DOGE ETF approval and increasing interest from social media, the price could surge to approximately $0.25 in July 2025. Under higher bullish momentum, it could even retest the formidable resistance at $0.39, which has proven challenging to overcome. However, if the demand zone at $0.130 – $0.150 is breached, then $0.10 could be hit. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) DOGE Price Target July 2025 0.10 0.25 0.39 DOGE Price Forecast 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to capture investor attention, primarily due to its history of delivering remarkable returns. One notable surge occurred in November 2024, following Donald Trump’s presidential election victory, which propelled the price to a peak of $0.4846 by year-end. However, profit-taking around this peak created a supply zone, triggering a downward trend. In January 2025, bulls made an effort to sustain the gains from Q4 2024. Yet, the high volume profile resistance at $0.39 proved formidable, pushing the price down to a low of $0.130 by early April. Interestingly, april’s low is near the demand zone at $0.130 – $0.150 that has previously supported a parabolic rally, and bulls are seen active in this area. Over the past couple of months, this level has been tested several times and has proven strong for bears to break that easily. Also, the most recent support taken by DOGE is in the final week of June, and since then, the price in the past 15 days is consolidating near the upper boundary of a downward wedge. A bullish reawakening at this level could pump a breakout to $0.25 level in July or could even retest the $0.39 high volume zone. Additionally, optimism around a potential DOGE ETF approval is growing. If approved, it could spark significant adoption, potentially flipping $0.39 and propelling the price beyond the previous high of $0.484 and setting the stage for a new bullish trajectory. In such a scenario, DOGE reaching $1 is not out of the question. On the flip side, if DOGE is rejected at the $0.39 resistance level by the end of 2025, it may retrace back to the demand zone near $0.13, posing renewed challenges for investors.

A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency. Its large and passionate community will likely continue to drive positive evolution. Conclusion Given Dogecoin’s past price behavior, driven largely by online hype and media coverage, it has the potential to reach over $1 in 2025. DOGE has shown remarkable resilience, and key factors like expanded merchant adoption, community growth, and protocol upgrades could enhance its viability.

During the APEX 2025 Event, Garlinghouse made clear that Ripple is aiming beyond traditional cross-border messaging systems. Rather than trying to displace SWIFT on its terms, Ripple is targeting liquidity, the core of financial value movement. Garlinghouse explained that there are two parts of SWIFT’s system: “There’s messaging, and there’s liquidity. Liquidity is owned by the banks.” He went on to clarify that Ripple’s long-term objective is not just to offer an alternative communication network for financial institutions, but to power the actual flow of money across borders. BRAD GARLINGHOUSE SAYS IT LOUD AND CLEAR #XRP WILL STEAL SWIFTS CUSTOMERS!!! pic.twitter.com/64WtW6OUm3 — FinanceBro (@FinanceBroYT) July 6, 2025 Liquidity Over Messaging While much of the global conversation around SWIFT alternatives has focused on messaging protocols and ISO 20022 alignment , Garlinghouse emphasized that the true opportunity lies elsewhere. “I think less about the messaging and more about liquidity,” he said, indicating that Ripple’s strategy is to insert itself directly into the heart of global financial plumbing. Ripple’s XRP-powered On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform already serves multiple corridors across the globe . This enables financial institutions to send money without pre-funded accounts. As more institutions adopt blockchain-based payment rails, Ripple’s value proposition becomes increasingly appealing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 14% Market Share Target At the APEX 2025 Event, the CEO predicted that Ripple would capture 14% of SWIFT’s current volume within five years . This prediction shows Ripple’s growing confidence in institutional adoption of XRP for cross-border settlement. With the company expanding partnerships and pursuing banking licenses in key jurisdictions, the 14% target appears to represent a broader strategic framework. Importantly, this projection does not merely reflect technical potential but speaks to Ripple’s understanding of legacy banking systems and their limitations. By focusing on liquidity rather than competing head-on with SWIFT’s messaging infrastructure, Ripple may be positioning itself to serve use cases where SWIFT remains inefficient or cost-prohibitive, and potentially replace the legacy system in the long term. XRP as the Future of Finance The implications of this shift are significant for XRP. If Ripple controls the liquidity layer of international payments, demand for XRP as a bridge asset could increase substantially. Garlinghouse’s focus on liquidity suggests that Ripple is preparing for a future in which XRP plays a central role in institutional finance. While it remains to be seen whether Ripple can capture the projected 14% share, Garlinghouse’s remarks reflect a belief that XRP will power the next phase of financial innovation.

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out. Table of Contents Overview Chainlink Price Target July 2025 LINK Price Prediction 2025 Chainlink Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s Chainlink Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Chainlink Token LINK Price $ 14.05958119 5.54% Market Cap $ 9,533,801,587.7776 Trading Volume $ 364,601,766.8571 Circulating Supply 678,099,970.4528 All-time High $52.88 May 10, 2021 All-time Low $0.1263 Sep 23, 2017 Chainlink Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Chainlink (LINK) is trying to reverse the decline from mid-May caused by a change in geopolitical factors. The end of June showed bullish reawakening in the short term as LINK price seeks a retest of the $18 neckline. This retest is essential for sustaining its upward momentum. The price is currently trying to stabilize around the $13 mark, and a successful break above the $18 level could signal a bullish trend. But if $13 breaks, then it might pull back to $10. LINK Price Prediction 2025 In 2025, Chainlink (LINK) started the year on a downward path, but by April, the tide began to turn. Early in the month, LINK began its recovery from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a crucial neckline set at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has faced challenges in maintaining its position near this neckline. By the third week of June, it pulled back toward the support level of the rounded bottom, which coincides with a multi-year support zone around $11. In the final week of June, LINK’s price began to rise again, but in past 15-days it is attempting to hold steady near the key $13 mark. If bullish momentum continues, LINK could aim to retest the neckline at $18 in July. For this price advance to sustain itself in the long term, LINK must break above and close daily above the $18 neckline. Such a move could signal a potential upward trend, increasing the chances of retesting the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4. This area is supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. If LINK manages to surpass the $24 mark, projections for late 2025 suggest that the token could soar as high as $32.

According to Peterson, the period he calls the “Bitcoin Bastille Day Rally” will begin on July 14, which the analyst believes could herald a significant recovery phase for Bitcoin. Peterson, in his analysis based on historical data, noted that in years where Bitcoin underperforms, it typically experiences a strong rally starting around Bastille Day. He explained that this rally typically begins on July 14th and lasts until July 30th, noting that this two-week period is a critical time for Bitcoin to recoup its losses from the year. Related News: The Country Where Tether (USDT) Is Keeping Tons of Its Gold Has Been Revealed - Here Are the Details However, this rise also comes with a warning for investors: According to Peterson, the ten-week period following this two-week recovery period stands out as one of the weakest performing periods for Bitcoin historically. Peterson also noted that Bitcoin behaves like a “compressed spring,” arguing that historically, Bitcoin has seen an average rise of at least 16% in positive months. However, this year, this figure has only been 9% so far. This suggests that strong moves above 16% are possible in the coming positive months, according to the analyst. *This is not investment advice.

Analysts predict PEPE could reach $0.000028 by 2025. Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $0.0002733 by 2030. Pepe Coin (PEPE), the memecoin inspired by the iconic frog meme, has rapidly become a standout in the crypto world. Ranked just behind Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE’s explosive rise—boasting gains of over +116,604,556% from its all-time low—has captured investor attention globally. As it maintains its position among top memecoins, many are now asking: Will PEPE price go parabolic by the end of 2025? In this article, explore CoinPedia’s in-depth PEPE coin price prediction for 2025, and discover long-term forecasts that look ahead to 2030. Table of contents Story Highlights Overview Pepe Coin Price Prediction July 2025 Pepe Price Prediction 2025 PEPE Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 PEPE Coin Market Analysis CoinPedia’s PEPE Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Pepe Token PEPE Price $ 0.00001016 2.30% Market Cap $ 4,273,897,745.0813 Trading Volume $ 625,077,211.6158 Circulating Supply 420,689,899,653,543.5625 All-time High $0.00002825 Dec 09, 2024 All-time Low $0.0…01062 Apr 14, 2023 Pepe Coin Price Prediction July 2025 In July, if PEPE can break above $0.00001050 and regain the short-term EMA of the 20-day and 50-day, there is potential for a move toward $0.00001350 or even $0.00001688. However, this will require an increase in trading volume and support from the broader market. On the other hand, if the bulls fail to maintain the $0.00000850 level, a retest of $0.00000760 or even $0.00000610 is likely. Falling below $0.00000610 would put PEPE at risk of reaching new lows. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Pepecoin Price Forecast July 2025 0.00000610 0.00001050 0.00001688 Pepe Price Prediction 2025 Pepe Coin is showing potential for growth in 2025. Initially seen as a joke, meme coins like PEPE, Dogecoin, and SHIB have found their place in the market, driven by social media excitement. With the PEPE brand still strong, a resurgence may be on the way as social buzz returns. In the first half of 2025, the PEPE price dropped by 65%. Despite a rally in Q2 that peaked at $0.00001610 by mid-May, the overall trend remains down, and it fell 40% from the mid-May peak to the end of June. As we move into July, PEPE crypto’s technical chart shows signs of life. After bouncing off key support in late June, bulls tried to rally but faced resistance again. Currently, PEPE price remains in a broader downtrend, with the Q2 decline forming a falling wedge pattern. Interestingly, the price action in Q2 aligns with Elliott Wave theory. After five impulsive waves and three corrective waves, the recent wave 3 has provided support, suggesting a potential market shift. At this stage PEPE price is indicating that bulls are reawakening in July. That said, Q3 could see the start of a new impulsive wave 1, as selling pressure appears to have diminished. In the short term, if the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands flip, PEPE’s first impulse wave may encounter resistance around $0.00001350. Following that, the Fibonacci 0.5 level at $0.00001688 could also act as resistance, as shown on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recently bounced back from oversold territory, indicating that the cooldown phase may be ending, paving the way for a rally. If PEPE price regains bullish momentum and completes a new wave 1, it could lead to a wave 2 a short pullback. After wave 2, a decisive breakout above $0.00001688 would confirm the third wave, potentially pushing PEPE to $0.00002837 by late 2025. For a bullish outlook, breaking the Fibonacci 0.5 level is essential. However, failing to surpass $0.00001688 could trigger a trend reversal and lead to a price pullback.

47862046,https://coinpaper.com/9856/ripple-testifies-before-senate-while-investor-declares-bankruptcy,1752040800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Ripple Testifies Before Senate While Investor Declares Bankruptcy,https://coinpaper.com/9856/ripple-testifies-before-senate-while-investor-declares-bankruptcy,"Ripple is facing scrutiny on two fronts this week as CEO Brad Garlinghouse testifies before the Senate Banking Committee in support of clearer crypto regulation, while investment platform Linqto, which holds 4.7 million Ripple shares, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The simultaneous developments show both Ripple’s growing presence in Washington policy circles and the risks emerging in the opaque world of secondary crypto markets. Linqto’s bankruptcy filing comes amid SEC investigations, internal allegations of investor misrepresentation, and broader questions about market structure—raising the stakes in an already critical moment for US crypto regulation. Senate Banking Committee to Hear From Ripple, Blockchain Association, and Chainalysis CEOs as Crypto Legislation Gains Momentum As the United States Congress inches closer to a long-awaited overhaul of digital asset regulation, key industry leaders and former regulators will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday to discuss the future of crypto oversight. The hearing marks a pivotal moment as lawmakers prepare to shape what could become the most comprehensive crypto legislative framework in US history. Executives scheduled to testify include Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Blockchain Association CEO and former CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger, former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad, and Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin. Their testimonies will address market structure, consumer protection, innovation, and the US's global competitiveness in digital finance. A Defining Moment for US Crypto Regulation Senators are expected to engage in high-stakes discussions about two landmark bills already circulating through Congress—the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, and the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act. Both pieces of legislation aim to provide clearer regulatory guardrails for cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms. “We are at a critical inflection point,” said Mersinger in prepared remarks. “The choice before us is not whether to regulate this industry, but how. We can either continue down a path of uncertainty that cedes our leadership and exports this innovation to other countries, or we can enact sensible, bipartisan legislation that cements our position as the premier destination for financial innovation for decades to come.” The hearing will give the Senate its first major opportunity to signal how it might approach comprehensive crypto legislation after the House moved forward with its own version during the start of what it’s calling “Crypto Week.” On Monday, the House of Representatives kicked off its legislative focus on crypto with plans to vote on three key bills: The GENIUS Act, already passed by the Senate, which would establish a framework for stablecoins backed by the US dollar. The CLARITY Act, which designates the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the lead agency for digital commodities while granting the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversight of crypto-related securities. A controversial anti-CBDC bill, aimed at halting the development of a US central bank digital currency. The push by Republican leadership to advance this legislation highlights a growing urgency to solidify US dominance in digital asset markets before the 2024 election cycle fully consumes the political landscape. Potential Conflicts Loom Over Trump Ties However, the political backdrop of the hearing is anything but clean. President Donald Trump’s growing involvement in the crypto space has raised eyebrows, especially as lawmakers debate bills that could benefit projects with links to him. Ripple, one of the companies at the center of the crypto lobbying effort, previously donated $5 million worth of XRP to Trump’s inaugural fund. Garlinghouse also attended a White House crypto summit hosted by Trump earlier this year. His appearance before Congress could intensify scrutiny of Ripple’s role in shaping policy. Adding more complexity, Trump and his family are reportedly affiliated with World Liberty Financial, a crypto firm that issued the USD1 stablecoin and played a role in launching Trump’s own meme coin earlier this year. To address potential ethical breaches, Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer, will also testify. His presence signals concerns that regulatory efforts may be influenced by personal or political financial interests, especially as crypto becomes an election talking point. While the GENIUS Act ultimately passed the Senate with bipartisan support in June, its path was initially marred by resistance from Democrats concerned about Trump’s growing involvement in crypto. Several withdrew support during the bill’s initial vote in May, citing the need to protect the legislative process from undue political influence. Those concerns have not dissipated. Some Democratic lawmakers have privately indicated they will continue to scrutinize crypto-related legislation where conflicts of interest may exist, especially as the Trump family expands its financial footprint in the digital asset industry. Industry Prepares for Regulatory Clarity Despite the political drama, many in the industry view this week’s events as a rare opportunity for progress. Jonathan Levin, whose firm Chainalysis helps law enforcement and government agencies monitor blockchain activity, is expected to emphasize the importance of transparency and data-driven policymaking. With global crypto trading volumes rebounding and institutional interest growing, market participants are eager for clarity. Firms want rules that allow them to innovate while maintaining compliance and protecting consumers. Linqto Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Amid Federal Probes and Ripple Share Controversy Meanwhile, Linqto, a prominent private investment platform known for offering fractional shares in pre-IPO companies, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The filing follows a wave of federal scrutiny, internal investigations, and public controversies surrounding its handling of investor funds, including its high-profile holdings in Ripple Labs. The bankruptcy, officially submitted on Monday, comes amid mounting concerns over Linqto's regulatory compliance and transparency practices. Although the company controls a substantial holding of 4.7 million Ripple shares—purchased on the secondary market—it has no formal relationship with the blockchain giant, a distinction Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse emphasized in a recent statement. An excerpt from Linqto’s voluntary petition for bankruptcy (Source: Epiq) “Apart from Linqto being a shareholder, Ripple has never had a business relationship with Linqto, nor have they participated in our financing rounds,” Garlinghouse clarified in a post on X (formerly Twitter) last week. Linqto’s 4.7 million Ripple shares were acquired privately through its investment vehicle, Liquidshares. While the exact timing and purchase price remain unclear, estimates from private market data provider Forge suggest the stake could be worth approximately $450 million based on a current secondary market share price of $95.5. However, recent court filings suggest Linqto believes its broader portfolio of private securities, including stakes in 111 companies, has an estimated fair market value exceeding $500 million. Ripple’s share price on the secondary market (Source: Forge) Despite these potentially significant valuations, there is uncertainty over the liquidity of Ripple’s secondary shares. According to Phil Haslett, co-founder of EquityZen, a leading private market platform, Ripple has initiated a $700 million tender offer at $175 per share, effectively pausing most secondary share transactions. “Ripple secondaries are generally paused while the company completes its reported $700 million tender offer,” Haslett said. “Before the tender, we observed prices around $70 to $75 per [Ripple] share.” Accusations of Fraud and Regulatory Violations Linqto’s financial troubles first came into public view on June 30 when The Wall Street Journal reported that the firm faced multiple federal investigations and was considering bankruptcy. According to internal memos obtained by the outlet, Linqto allegedly misled customers into believing they owned actual shares in private companies, when they may not have. Worse still, the company may have marketed these investments to unqualified investors in violation of US securities law. Linqto’s new CEO, Dan Siciliano, acknowledged the gravity of the situation in a statement shared internally. “Much of what we discovered about the prior business practices at Linqto is disturbing,” Siciliano said. “These practices aren’t small one-off, compliance or common regulatory missteps.” One of the most alarming revelations includes an alleged markup scheme by former CEO William Sarris, who reportedly sold Ripple shares to Linqto’s 11,000 users at a markup of over 60%—far beyond the 10% threshold set by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That action alone, if confirmed, could represent a clear violation of federal securities laws. SEC Investigation and Lawsuits Mount A Tuesday court filing indicated that Linqto improperly structured its series LLCs and failed to obtain transfer permissions from issuing companies like Ripple . These issues are now part of an ongoing SEC investigation, which the company acknowledged in bankruptcy court documents. Adding to its legal woes, former Chief Revenue Officer Gene Zawrotny filed a whistleblower lawsuit against Linqto and its former top executives, alleging widespread compliance failures and internal retaliation. The suit specifically names Sarris and former Chief Operating Officer Joe Endoso. Linqto officially closed its investment platform on March 13, effectively halting all revenue-generating operations. According to filings, the company’s liabilities may significantly outweigh its accessible assets, placing investors and creditors in a precarious position. The company’s first bankruptcy hearing is scheduled for Tuesday at 9:00 PM UTC. Witnesses include Chief Restructuring Officer Jeffrey Stein, Epiq Corporate Restructuring’s Kate Mailloux, and Ryan Hamilton, senior vice president for debt advisory at Jefferies. In the lead-up to the hearing, Linqto responded to public speculation about changes to its Ripple share holdings. In a statement published on Monday, the company said: “Contrary to published reports on X, Linqto confirms that Liquidshares’ holdings of Ripple shares remain unchanged, and as confirmed by Ripple last week, Linqto continues to own 4.7 million shares.” Ripple Distances Itself from Linqto Ripple has been keen to distance itself from the embattled investment firm. In late 2024, Ripple halted Linqto’s access to secondary Ripple shares, reportedly after the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) completed a review of Linqto’s broker-dealer unit, Linqto Capital. Garlinghouse reiterated that Linqto was never authorized to resell or manage Ripple’s shares and had no approval to market them in violation of securities rules.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-09 06:00:00

The acquisition was announced on July 8 by Rally co-founder and chief executive officer Chris Maddern, who will now serve as OpenSea’s chief technology officer. Rally co-founder Christine Hall also joins OpenSea’s leadership team. The Rally team will help develop a reimagined OpenSea Mobile experience, which the company says will become the central hub for onchain activity, spanning non-fungible tokens, memecoins, decentralized finance, and digital assets. While details are still limited, the Rally app will eventually be integrated into OpenSea’s broader product suite. OpenSea has acquired @rally_xyz 🏁 Buckle up.

The acquisition is expected to improve OpenSea’s capacity to cater to general users, especially as demand for token-native platforms and integrated mobile experiences rises. As part of the integration, OpenSea is recognizing Rally’s earliest supporters, the holders of Floor Genesis NFTs. These NFTs were originally issued as access passes to the first private beta builds of Rally’s early app, then named Floor. Holders played a key role in shaping product direction through feedback and testing. OpenSea now plans to convert these NFTs into tiered Treasures, special reward tokens within the OpenSea ecosystem designed to acknowledge meaningful user contributions. A snapshot mechanism will be used to facilitate the reward conversion, and eligible holders can use the OpenSea Rewards portal to claim their Treasures. The new mobile push comes shortly after OpenSea’s May launch of OS2, its upgraded platform that supports trading across 19 blockchains. OS2 includes cross-chain functionality, real-time liquidity aggregation, and support for both NFTs and tokens. A SEA token airdrop is also underway to reward longtime users.

The program, which was announced on July 8, is one of the biggest of its kind in web3 and aims to identify and fix critical vulnerabilities across Coinbase’s smart contracts. Security researchers are encouraged to submit their findings through Cantina’s platform, which facilitates repeatable and structured reviews. Every submission is assessed by experienced triagers, and rewards are based on how significant and serious each finding is. Coinbase has emphasized the importance of clear, actionable submissions that can lead to quick resolutions.

In May, the company faced a high-profile data breach involving bribed support staff.

The company has since taken several steps to improve internal controls and raise overall security standards. Alongside the work with Coinbase, Cantina has emerged as a major force in Web3 security. Its platform streamlines review workflows and lowers the number of low-value submissions by combining AI-powered tools with expert-led triage. Cantina has also hosted major programs like Uniswap’s ( UNI ) $15.5 million bounty for version 4 of its protocol. The new bug bounty reflects Coinbase’s ongoing shift toward open collaboration with the security research community .

Although they acknowledged that it was a challenging prediction to make given their speculative nature, all four backed the same horse. Who’s First? Leaving aside the communities behind both cryptocurrencies and their respective ecosystems, this article will focus on what ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Grok answered when asked the same question: Will XRP hit $10 first, or will ETH reach $10,000 first? Historically, Ether had come closer to its rather tall goal as it surged to almost $5,000 back in 2021. In contrast, XRP’s all-time high was at $3.4 in January 2018, and the asset only managed to match it in 2025. Although ETH is slightly closer to its target now, the difference is negligible as both require rather similar price increases (of around 300%) to reach their respective goals. While this sounds significant, especially for the two largest altcoins, let’s not forget that XRP experienced an even more remarkable price surge in late 2024 and early 2025. All AI solutions admitted that ETH appears as the more likely horse to win this race. They laid out its path toward the $10,000 target, claiming that ecosystem growth, network upgrades, RWA tokenization, and institutional adoption will push it higher. ChatGPT was particularly interested in the institutional adoption segment, indicating that ETH has an advantage not just because of the ETF demand it sees, but also due to the growing number of companies that have recently started storing ether as a reserve asset. Some even dumped BTC to buy more ETH. “Ethereum hitting $10,000 first seems more probable in the medium term. Its established ecosystem, ongoing technological advancements (especially the impact of spot ETFs), and its central role in the broader crypto space (DeFi, NFTs, RWA tokenization) provide a more diverse and robust set of drivers. The percentage increase required for Ethereum is also slightly lower than for XRP to reach $10.” – concluded Gemini but the sentiment was echoed by all other AIs. XRP’s Case Although the AI chatbots seemed conclusive in picking ETH as the potential winner, they also outlined the less probable scenario in which XRP goes into double-digit price territory first. Gemini said that its path is “contingent on regulatory clarity and widespread institutional adoption for cross-border payments.” Grok noted that Ripple’s token can reach $10 if the company behind it continues with its massive partnerships and acquisitions, which could increase the overall trust in the project. Recall that the company spent over $1.2 billion earlier this year to acquire the prime brokerage giant Hidden Road, a move described by the community as a “game-changer” for XRP . Additionally, all four AIs highlighted the potential approval of spot XRP ETF in the States, the odds of which are over 90% , according to experts and Polymarket. This would open the doors for institutions to invest in XRP through regulated financial vehicles, which should, in theory, act as a price booster.

With this, the top 10 tokens like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Tron, Dogecoin and Cardano, hold above their respective support. Meanwhile, Cronos price spiked heavily due to the external factors, while the other tokens attracted notable gains. Therefore, the current crypto markets appear to be largely stable, with the market capitalisation and volume remaining within a range. Although the BTC price is an inch close to its ATH, the market sentiments continue to remain neutral, while the star token continues to hold a huge dominance. Besides, Cronos (CRO) and Raydium (RAY) attract double-digit gains, followed by popular memecoins. Meanwhile, the other tokens attract decent gains, hinting towards the markets experiencing a stabilized state. Cronos Settles After A Massive Breakout The CRO price experienced a pullback of nearly 5% after rising by more than 22% following the inclusion in the Truth Social Blue-Chip ETF filing . The token not only broke above the multi-month consolidated zone but also attracted volume that surged from levels around $10 million to as high as $230 million within a few hours. The long-term price action appears bearish as the sellers have booked the profit, but the short-term price action hints towards a drop in their actions as well. The CRO price is trying hard to hold the local support at $0.0897, which may offer a strong bullish rebound. The StochRSI has reached the oversold range, while the hourly MACD displays a rise in the selling pressure. However, the chart pattern suggests the support could be held firmly, which may further reinstitute a strong upswing back to the local highs and eventually achieve $0.1. Raydium Preparing for a Parabolic Recovery Raydium is climbing steadily with a significant rise in the buying pressure and is currently trading at $2.42 with a huge rise of over 13% in the past 24 hours. The token broke the $2.3 level with a strong bounce after bouncing from the $2.01 lows. This breakout is backed by a massive rise in the volume and a clean trend. RAY price appears to be undergoing a parabolic recovery that initiated before the start of the month. The latest rise pushed the price above the 50-day MA, which is now serving as a temporary support. A daily close above the levels could validate the rise, but until then, the fear of the pullback may haunt the rally. On the other hand, the RSI is incremental, which hints towards the rising strength of the rally. Therefore, the next levels to look out for are $2.42, followed by $2.56 and $2.7.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRO|RAY|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-09 06:12:35

Ripple has already dropped its cross-appeal, and now everyone’s waiting to see if the SEC will officially withdraw theirs. If that happens, the years-long legal battle could wrap up in a matter of days or weeks. Regulatory clarity is finally within reach, and the future for XRP is starting to look a lot clearer. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is all set to testify before the Senate today with a sharp focus on XRP and regulatory clarity in the U.S. He has shared his full testimony ahead of the hearing. My full testimony for the hearing is available here: https://t.co/NHTh8wKQMc — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 8, 2025 In the testimony, Brad highlights Ripple’s decade-long mission to build an “Internet of Value,” where money moves seamlessly like information. He also stressed Ripple’s compliance-first approach, highlighting over 60 licenses and ongoing work with regulators. Ripple vs. SEC: A Legal Battle Close To Being Resolved Garlinghouse shared that smart crypto regulation should protect consumers, keep bad actors in check, make sure markets are well overseen, and still leave room for innovation. He also pointed out the damage that was caused due to years of regulatory uncertainty, which drove innovation and jobs offshore. He notes that Ripple was the first major U.S. crypto company that was sued by the SEC in 2020. Brad Outlines 3 Key Priorities Ahead After a four-year legal battle, Ripple won a landmark ruling: the court determined that XRP is not a security. He underscored that the win was not just a victory for Ripple but for the entire U.S. crypto industry. Despite these challenges, Ripple continues to engage with lawmakers and regulators, stressing the need for smart and clearer crypto rules. He has outlined three key priorities for Congress: Firstly, clearly define the roles of financial regulators, secondly, create safe pathways for companies to innovate in the U.S., and finally, a real plan to ensure that the U.S. can be a global crypto leader. Brad says that the U.S. has everything it needs to lead in the blockchain. With over 55 million Americans involved in crypto and a $3.4 trillion market cap, a clear regulatory framework is long overdue. Brad Urges to Push CLARITY Act Forward He also called on the Senate to prioritize passing the crypto market structure bill (The CLARITY Act) for digital assets. This would spark a new wave of innovation and bring major benefits to both consumers and businesses. Ripple, he added, is ready to work with lawmakers to help make that future a reality. Tomorrow, on July 10th, the SEC will hold a closed-door meeting.
