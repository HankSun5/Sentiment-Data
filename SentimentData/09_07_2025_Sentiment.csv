Analysts Eye MAGACOIN FINANCE, Dogecoin, and Avalanche",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/best-low-cap-coins-for-100x-gains-analysts-eye-magacoin-finance-dogecoin-and-avalanche/,"The crypto market’s hunger for breakout opportunities has analysts revisiting low-cap coins that could deliver exponential returns. Among the names getting the most attention in 2025 are MAGACOIN FINANCE, Dogecoin, and Avalanche—each with a different story, different trajectory, and vastly different 100x odds. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Top Contender for 100x in 2025 MAGACOIN FINANCE has emerged as one of the most talked-about early-stage meme-powered altcoins of the year. With a current price still under a cent and massive online momentum, some analysts believe the token offers the strongest path to 100x returns in this cycle. Forecasts suggest that even a modest rise to its projected listing value could deliver a 25x return for early participants. More aggressive projections go much further, with targets ranging from $1 to as high as $5, depending on how far the meme narrative and community push the token in a bull market. Based on its current valuation, even hitting $0.027 would be enough for a full 100x—something analysts say is realistic if momentum continues. What makes MAGACOIN FINANCE stand out isn’t just the price point. It’s the mix of strong presale traction, a fully audited contract, and a zero-tax trading structure that appeals to early adopters. Add in a politically charged meme identity and a fast-growing community of over 12,000 holders, and you get a high-risk token that many view as a serious high-reward play. Dogecoin and Avalanche Offer Stability, But Not Explosive Growth Dogecoin still commands loyalty from retail investors and remains one of the most recognizable names in crypto. Priced around $0.22, it has room for growth in the next bull run—but not enough to offer a 100x return. Analysts see possible price action lifting it to $1.25 at most. To 100x from current levels, DOGE would need to climb to $22, which is viewed as a long shot due to its already massive market cap and circulating supply. Avalanche, on the other hand, is seen as a more technically sophisticated option. With a price hovering between $25 and $26, it continues to grow its presence in the DeFi and enterprise sectors. AVAX could see solid price gains in the future, with some analysts forecasting it could hit $100 or even $160 during peak market conditions. But even the most bullish predictions don’t come close to the kind of returns that smaller, early-stage projects can offer. For Avalanche to deliver a 100x, the price would need to cross $2,500—a scenario analysts consider unrealistic unless bought at much lower levels. What Analysts Are Watching Now Beyond these three names, a few other tokens are also entering the conversation. PeiPei (PEIPEI) is one of the newer meme coins gaining traction. Projects like GameSwift and Hivemapper are drawing attention for their innovation in gaming and decentralized infrastructure. AI-focused coins such as Fetch.AI, Akash Network, and Bittensor also show potential—especially as AI and crypto continue to converge. Still, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in a league of its own when it comes to low-cost entry and sheer narrative power. The project has captured early attention and built a loyal base around its anti-centralization ethos, grassroots appeal, and meme-fueled marketing. Final Take For investors seeking massive upside in 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers the most realistic shot at 100x returns—if momentum continues and broader market sentiment turns bullish. Dogecoin and Avalanche remain solid names but are unlikely to deliver outsized gains from their current valuations. As always, low-cap crypto investments come with high risk. But when timed right, they can also deliver the kind of life-changing returns the market is chasing.

47835982,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=762489,1752014175,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47835982.jpeg,Cathie Wood doubles down on Elon Musk support amid Tesla's slow revival,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cathie-wood-doubles-down-on-elon-musk/,"Cathie Wood is still all-in on Elon Musk, even as Tesla stock continues to tank and his political ambitions get louder. Speaking on Bloomberg Television this week, the Ark Invest founder defended the CEO while shares in the electric car company kept falling. The stock dropped nearly 7% on Monday, wiping out $68 billion from Tesla’s market cap, after Musk said he was starting a new political party. But Cathie, who’s been holding Tesla in her funds since 2014, said she’s not worried. According to Bloomberg, Cathie pointed to Elon’s recent decision to take over Tesla’s sales in the US and Europe as a sign that he’s finally focusing on the company again. She said: “One of the announcements Elon made recently is that he is going to oversee sales in the US and in Europe. When he puts his mind on something, he usually gets the job done. So I think he’s much less distracted now than he was, let’s say, in the White House 24/7.” The timing comes as Tesla’s market position in Europe and China weakens, with falling deliveries and customer pushback. Musk forms political party while Tesla stumbles Elon’s announcement over the weekend added another layer of chaos. He said he’s launching the “America Party” to take on both Republicans and Democrats in the upcoming House and Senate races. He also didn’t rule out backing a presidential candidate. This comes as Donald Trump, now serving again as US President, has regained his grip over the Republican Party. Wall Street didn’t love that. The stock’s decline added to a rough year, Tesla is now down 27% in 2025 and has dropped in eight of the last nine sessions. Elon’s change toward politics hasn’t helped, especially in international markets where sales are slipping. But Cathie isn’t pulling back. She’s betting that Tesla’s next growth wave will come from the robotaxi project. She previously told Bloomberg that the stock could hit $2,600 within five years, nearly nine times where it trades now, and that 90% of the company’s future value will come from that robotaxi rollout. Her support isn’t limited to Tesla. Cathie also holds positions in Elon’s other companies, including xAI, SpaceX, and Neuralink. She’s stayed quiet on the political drama, saying, “We’ve been dealing with controversy around Elon Musk in one form or another since we first bought the stock. We do trust the board and the board’s instincts here and we stay out of politics.” Dan Ives clashes with Musk over control and accountability On Tuesday, the heat turned up when Dan Ives, Managing Director at Wedbush Securities and one of Tesla’s most bullish analysts, called for urgent changes. Ives has the highest Tesla price target on Wall Street — $500 — but he took to X to criticize Elon’s political detour and recommended that the board take control. He laid out three suggestions: give Elon a new pay package that gives him 25% voting power, greenlight a merger with xAI, and set clear limits on how much time he spends away from Tesla. Elon didn’t respond quietly. “Shut up, Dan,” he wrote on X, brushing off all of Ives’ proposals. It didn’t matter that Ives’ first idea actually supports Elon’s long-held desire for more control of Tesla. The post drew even more attention to the mess unfolding inside the company. That same day, Ives and his team released a detailed note titled, “The Tesla board MUST Act and Create Ground Rules For Musk; Soap Opera Must End.” It said Elon’s decision to enter politics marked a “tipping point in the Tesla story” and warned that the board needs to intervene before more value gets destroyed. Still, Wedbush held its buy rating and price target. Meanwhile, the stock bounced slightly on Tuesday, climbing 1.3%. But the bigger issues remain. Elon’s involvement in US politics, combined with falling sales and slipping deliveries in Europe and China, has raised fresh concerns about the company’s direction. Cathie, though, hasn’t budged. She’s still backing the board. She’s still holding Tesla. And she’s still betting on Elon’s long game, robotaxis, AI, and whatever else he decides is the next frontier. Outside of Tesla, Cathie also called out Apple’s recent loss of its top AI executive to Meta. “If you think about the ultimate mobile device, it’s an autonomous vehicle and that should have been Apple’s to win,” she said. She believes the Apple Car was the biggest AI project out there and now that another talent is gone, the company is “in a precarious position.” Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg is going all-in on AI, trying to compete with OpenAI and Google. Cathie said Meta’s open-source strategy in generative AI is “quite admired,” but questioned if Zuckerberg is just repeating his metaverse misstep. Even with all the chaos, Cathie isn’t walking away from Elon or his companies. She’s been through the noise before and doesn’t seem fazed by the current firestorm. As for Dan, he’s not changing his stance either. In an email to CNBC, he wrote, “Elon has his opinion and I get it, but we stand by what the right course of action is for the Board.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Over the past three weeks, an average of 130 million $GALA tokens per day have been bridged into GalaChain . With the recent updates to the Founder Node rewards system there is an increasing use of network’s features. Updated Node Staking Model Now Live On June 16, 2025, Gala launched a new model for how Founder Node rewards are earned. Node operators are now required to hold $GALA in their GalaChain wallet or allowance in order to receive rewards. To earn 100% of the daily rewards per node, a user must hold 1 million $GALA. Holding less still earns rewards, but at a lower percentage based on the amount held. This update aligns node rewards with participation and encourages direct engagement on GalaChain. In a future phase, the system will shift from just holding $GALA to requiring it to be locked for additional user participation. As part of this staking update, Gala also introduced a new token called $GSTAKE. Once live, it will let users stake with $GSTAKE instead of $GALA, with a 1:1 ratio for rewards. $GSTAKE will be minted by converting specific NFTs purchased with $GALA. Details on which NFTs qualify and how the conversion works will be shared before the second phase of the rollout. Once live, $GSTAKE will be tradable on Gala Connect, GalaSwap, and possibly other platforms. Simplified rewards Even with large volumes of $GALA being bridged to GalaChain, enough liquidity remains on exchanges. This ensures that new users can still access the token easily while long-term holders benefit from better integration and utility. With billions in $GALA now moving to Galachain, the momentum across the ecosystem is strong. It reflects the growing confidence of the community with the upcoming launch of GalaSwap, Gala’s own DEX, is adding to the momentum.

While bulls have successfully flipped $2,500 from resistance into support, the price still faces significant pressure below the $2,700 zone. This range-bound behavior has persisted since early May, and the coming days are likely to define the next major move, not only for ETH but also for the broader altcoin market. Related Reading: Ethereum Range Tightens – Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350 Top analyst Ted Pillows shared technical insights, highlighting Ethereum’s current structure, particularly after the $2,500 level was reclaimed. However, the next challenge lies in reclaiming the range high. A breakout above this key resistance could trigger a strong bullish continuation and potentially ignite an altseason, as capital often rotates into altcoins once ETH gains momentum. On the flip side, failure to sustain current support may open the door for a pullback toward lower demand levels. For now, bulls appear to be in control, but the market remains on edge, awaiting a decisive move. Whether ETH can build enough strength to break through resistance or slips into another leg of consolidation will likely shape sentiment and positioning for the weeks ahead. Ethereum Builds Strength As It Eyes Range High Ethereum continues to trade within a well-defined consolidation zone, oscillating between $2,400 and $2,700 since early May. After reclaiming the $2,500 level and flipping it into support, ETH now looks poised for a potential breakout. Ted Pillows highlighted this shift in momentum, stating that Ethereum is “looking good” and could soon revisit the upper boundary of the range. However, despite Ethereum’s strength, broader market conditions remain mixed. Bitcoin’s failure to break above its all-time high adds pressure to the crypto market, and altcoins continue to struggle to find solid footing. While macroeconomic uncertainty has eased following encouraging job reports and legislative developments in the US, headwinds persist. Rising US Treasury yields and the Federal Reserve’s ongoing delay in cutting interest rates contribute to a cautious environment. Still, Ethereum’s ability to hold above $2,500 suggests bullish intent. If price pushes toward and ultimately breaks above $2,700, it could trigger a broader move across altcoins, reawakening market momentum. But without a breakout in the short term, another leg of consolidation—or even a pullback—remains possible. This week may prove pivotal in setting the tone for Ethereum and the altcoin market’s next phase. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Downside If Resistance Holds: $2,700 Level Is Critical ETH Tests Resistance As Consolidation Tightens Ethereum is trading at $2,550, holding above its key moving averages and continuing to consolidate in a tight range. The daily chart shows that ETH is attempting to break above the 200-day moving average (red), currently sitting near $2,488, while managing to stay above both the 50-day (blue) and 100-day (green) moving averages. This convergence of key technical levels highlights the current equilibrium between bulls and bears. Despite multiple attempts since early May, Ethereum has not been able to sustain a breakout above the $2,700 mark. Each push higher has faced selling pressure, suggesting that this zone remains a major area of resistance. However, recent price action shows higher lows and strong defense of the $2,500 level, signaling building momentum. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low – Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Trading volume remains relatively flat, which aligns with the ongoing consolidation, but could also foreshadow a volatility spike once direction is confirmed. A successful daily close above the $2,600–$2,700 zone could trigger an impulsive move toward $3,000 and beyond. Conversely, a breakdown below the $2,480 level would invalidate the bullish structure and shift sentiment.

Ford Motor Co. announced on Tuesday that its $3B electric vehicle (EV) battery plant in Marshall, Michigan is “on track” and expected to qualify for valuable federal production tax credits, after several key revisions were made in a sweeping tax and budget bill passed by U.S. lawmakers. Ford’s EV battery plant in Michigan is back on track Ford’s Marshall facility was announced in February 2023, and is expected to create 1,700 jobs in Michigan. The plant will manufacture lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells using technology licensed from CATL, the world’s largest EV battery maker. The battery plant, now 60% complete and scheduled to begin production in 2026, had been at risk of losing federal incentives due to its partnership with Chinese battery giant Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Limited (CATL). Despite CATL’s critical role in global EV supply chains, its ties to China have sparked bipartisan concern in Washington. Several lawmakers have questioned whether American taxpayer dollars should support a project that uses Chinese intellectual property. Back in May, Ford warned that language in the House version of the legislation could compromise the Marshall project. The proposed provisions would have restricted production tax credits for any battery components made by certain Chinese companies or produced under a licensing agreement with them. That clause would have disqualified Ford’s use of CATL technology. But the final version of the legislation, which was passed recently, revised that language. Now, Ford says it is confident the Marshall plant will qualify for the production tax credit, which supports the domestic manufacturing of EV batteries. “This is a win for our customers and a win for American competitiveness,” the company said in a statement. The new U.S. tax bill restructures EV incentives In 2023, Michigan reduced its incentive package for the project after Ford scaled back expected production volumes to align with slowing EV demand nationwide. The company cited the declining consumer interest in EVs, alongside high production costs, as reasons for its more cautious rollout. However, the new U.S. bill offers significant new benefits to automakers. In addition to preserving production tax credits for battery manufacturing, even when the technology involves Chinese partners like CATL, the law eliminates penalties for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) targets. Industry analysts have stated that while the law’s changes remove near-term obstacles for automakers, they also raise questions about the long-term strategy. “This is a necessary compromise to maintain momentum in EV manufacturing,” a policy analyst familiar with the legislation said. “But over time, the U.S. will still need to invest heavily in its own battery technology and supply chains if it wants true independence.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Raoul Pal Believes This Bullish History Will Repeat",https://timestabloid.com/69000-xrp-price-rally-on-the-cards-raoul-pal-believes-this-bullish-history-will-repeat/,"David Pal, co-founder of Real Vision, suggests that the cryptocurrency market is mirroring the behavioral pattern seen in early 2017 following Donald Trump’s first presidential inauguration. This observation may carry significant implications for XRP, especially if a repeat of that historic surge materializes. Market Stagnation Amid 2025 Political Flux Despite a strong rally across the cryptocurrency sector from November 2024 to January 2025, activity has slowed. Altcoins, including XRP, have traded sideways in recent months, while Bitcoin has set new all-time highs. This divergence has led many investors to pause and ask what comes next for the broader market and major altcoins like XRP. Pal identifies a parallel between current market dynamics and those seen during the first Trump presidency. In late 2016, following Trump’s victory, global financial markets reacted with increased volatility and a stronger U.S. dollar. A similar strengthening of the dollar occurred after Trump’s recent election, contributing to tightening financial conditions and asset price corrections in early 2025. Like in 2017, Pal notes that this recent strengthening of the dollar is likely temporary and driven by policy shifts rather than fundamental economic forces. The strategic pressure for a weaker dollar, he explains, creates a favorable environment for risk assets, particularly equities and cryptocurrencies. As the dollar softens, capital typically flows back into these markets, potentially setting the stage for renewed rallies. XRP’s 2017 Rally: A Metric for Comparison XRP exhibited a remarkable climb in early 2017. Between March and May of that year, its price rose from $0.0055 to $0.3988, a staggering 7,150% increase. A consolidation followed until December, after which XRP surged again, rising 1,517% to reach an all-time high of $3.80 in January 2018. Altogether, this cycle saw XRP appreciate nearly 69,000%. Repeating History? The token’s recent price trajectory shows striking similarities to the 2017 cycle. From November 2024 through January 2025, following Trump’s election, the token climbed from approximately $0.50 to $3.40, a 580% gain over three months. A subsequent six-month consolidation phase has ensued, mirroring the 2017 pattern. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Technical analysts and market strategists now forecast a forthcoming breakout phase. EGRAG Crypto, among others, suggests that if the historical pattern continues, XRP could experience a second upward wave of around 121.8%, potentially pushing its price from approximately $2.27 to $5. Some analysts even project a minimum of $6 in this next leg, with the possibility of reaching $7.80 should momentum intensify. In May, Raoul Pal himself expressed confidence about XRP’s next directional move. If XRP follows the same trajectory as the 2017 rally, continued momentum could yield significant returns. A 121.8% increase from its current price would place XRP near $5. A doubling of that move could push its valuation to nearly $8. These scenarios, while speculative, offer a clear reference point for investors monitoring XRP’s alignment with macroeconomic shifts and historical precedent. If Raoul Pal’s comparison holds, the present market structure may mark the beginning of another major altcoin rally similar to the 2017 cycle. For XRP holders, this context provides reason for optimism, but it also underscores the need for disciplined analysis, risk management, and close attention to macroeconomic indicators.

This strategic rotation toward narrative-rich, community-led projects has thrust MAGACOIN FINANCE into the spotlight — prompting serious discussions about whether it stands out as the best crypto presale to accumulate ahead of the anticipated market surge. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE is Capturing Early Investor Attention Unlike most emerging altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE combines the viral energy of a meme project with a sharply defined political and cultural identity. It’s this distinct positioning that has analysts and early adopters flagging it as a unique entry in the current presale landscape. Key reasons it’s gaining traction: Transparent, zero-tax tokenomics: Transactions carry no buy or sell tax, a feature designed to maximize potential upside by ensuring investor capital isn’t slowly drained by hidden fees. Decentralized governance: Holders have genuine input in the project’s direction, appealing to a growing cohort of traders who prioritize community influence over top-down control. Viral narrative: MAGACOIN FINANCE taps into both meme culture and political symbolism, setting it apart from purely speculative tokens. This narrative depth is often a driver of lasting engagement. Adding to the intrigue, the project’s early rounds have already seen overwhelming participation, with thousands of contributors securing positions well before wider awareness takes hold. Analyst Commentary: “Timing Could Be Everything” While established assets like Ethereum and XRP continue to anchor institutional portfolios — with Ethereum ETFs drawing billions in flows and Ripple eyeing a U.S. banking license — seasoned crypto analysts stress that the most dramatic multipliers often come from presales positioned just ahead of major market rotations. MAGACOIN FINANCE is currently benefiting from: Undervalued early-stage status: Its presale valuation remains a fraction of what similar projects have reached post-launch. Fast community formation: Telegram and social channels have reported robust growth, a signal that retail interest is building organically rather than via heavy marketing alone. Limited allocation windows: Each presale stage has moved quickly, reinforcing the notion that supply is tightening. Investors looking to capture pre-listing prices may find that waiting until later stages — or after an exchange debut — reduces their potential upside. Early Comparisons: Could MAGACOIN FINANCE Follow the Path of DOGE or SHIBA INU? Historically, many of the most explosive crypto success stories have shared a few common characteristics: a grassroots community, a narrative that resonates beyond mere price charts, and an accessible entry point that draws wide participation. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be aligning with that template. Its blend of humor, political messaging, and zero-tax structure invites parallels to the early momentum of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu — but with arguably clearer tokenomics and a sharper ideological theme that could drive loyalty beyond speculative cycles. The Bottom Line: A Standout Crypto Presale Ahead of a Potential Bull Run As forecasts for late 2025 continue to circle around macroeconomic catalysts and expanding institutional crypto products, the broader market may be setting the stage for renewed altcoin inflows. For investors seeking more than incremental gains, MAGACOIN FINANCE presents a rare blend of meme-driven community, political narrative, and transparent structure — positioning it as arguably the best crypto presale to consider before broader capital rotations accelerate. Early participants could be securing a foothold well before major listings amplify demand — making now a strategic moment to evaluate where this project fits in a diversified crypto portfolio.

The Russian state-run news agency TASS reported that the press service of the diplomatic mission confirmed it had sent the department a formal request. The service said the embassy was “closely monitoring the situation around Dmitry Vasiliev.” It noted that Polish courts extradited the Russian citizen at the request of the US authorities.” A spokesperson said: “We have requested that information about Vasiliev’s location, health condition, and procedural status of Vasiliev be provided as soon as possible.” Russian Embassy: We Want Updates on Vasiliev The service also demanded that Russian consular officers be allowed to meet with Vasiliev under the terms of the 1964 Bilateral Consular Convention. Vasiliev and others set up WEX as a successor to the BTC-e exchange. It ceased trading in 2018. The closure left scores of customers unable to access fiat and coins worth almost $0.5 billion. The embassy said that once it receives information about Vasiliev, it would “immediately contact him and provide him with the necessary consular and legal assistance.” The Russian Embassy in Washington DC in 2020. (Source: Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs [CC BY 4.0]) Vasiliev’s legal team at the European Court of Human Rights last month told Russian reporters that Polish officials had deported their client from Warsaw in 2024. At the time, Vasiliev was wanted in the United States. Prosecutors say he masterminded a criminal fraud and money laundering network. The lawyers said that Vasiliev was extradited to the US “as part of a criminal case involving [the former BTC-e finance chief] Alexander Vinnik.” US prosecutors accused Vinnik of laundering $4 billion to $9 billion through the now-defunct BTC-e crypto exchange. Greek police arrested him in 2017. A court then extradited him to the US in August 2022. In February this year, Vinnik was freed in a prisoner swap with the American teacher Marc Fogel.

In a recent post on X, Rothschild stated that the digital asset must first break through specific benchmarks, namely $7 and $13 before any serious momentum toward the $36 level can be expected. Rothschild’s projection has reignited long-standing discussions about XRP’s growth potential. Critics often push back on high price targets, citing the substantial increase required for such outcomes. At its current trading price near $2.27, XRP would need to rally over 1,500% to reach $36. If XRP were to reach that level, its market capitalization would exceed $2.1 trillion, similar to Bitcoin’s current valuation. Such a scenario would position XRP above major global assets like silver and corporations, including Facebook and Saudi Aramco. Skeptics argue that achieving this valuation in the short term is unlikely due to broader market limitations and regulatory uncertainty. 36$ for XRP is not unrealistic, but first 7-13$ — Nathaniel C. J. Rothschild (@NCJRothschild) July 5, 2025 Timeline Estimates from Analysts Various forecasting models offer different timelines for XRP potentially reaching or approaching the $36 threshold. Research published by Telegaon projects that this price may be achievable by the year 2030, assuming favorable market conditions and adoption trends. Bitwise, in a separate analysis targeted at institutional investors, proposed a slightly lower target of $29 by 2030 in an ultra-bullish scenario. Their more conservative short-term outlook sees XRP potentially hitting $6.53 under optimal conditions in 2025 or 2026 but also considers the possibility of a price retracement to around $1.07. Changelly, another market research platform, adopts an even longer horizon, estimating that XRP could reach $36 sometime in 2032. These projections vary based on the assumptions behind each model, including market adoption, institutional investment, and technological developments within the XRP Ledger ecosystem. Views from Independent Analysts Despite the conservative nature of institutional forecasts, independent market watchers maintain a more optimistic stance. Analyst Dustin Layton recently predicted that XRP could reach at least $50 before the end of this year, challenging the broader crypto community to reexamine their expectations. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Similarly, EGRAG Crypto, known for his historical pattern-based analysis, suggested that XRP could experience a price surge of up to 2,000%, bringing the token above $37 if its previous market cycles repeat. However, he also acknowledged that a more moderate scenario could see XRP peak around $9 if momentum falls short. Community Reactions Remain Divided Rothschild’s comments sparked a mixed response from the online XRP community. Some users expressed enthusiasm, arguing that in the world of cryptocurrency, such targets are attainable over time. One commenter described $36 as cheap, implying that even higher valuations could be possible. On the other hand, some urged caution , stressing the need to focus on nearer-term targets and arguing that projections of major price increases should be based on present market performance. While opinions differ widely on whether XRP can realistically attain a $36 price point, consensus exists around the need for the asset to achieve interim price milestones first.

A Founding Architect of XRP Ledger Arthur Britto was instrumental in the creation of Ripple Labs in 2012, alongside David Schwartz, Chris Larsen, and Jed McCaleb. In collaboration with his co-founders, Britto helped establish the XRP Ledger “as a next-generation payment solution for scalability and transaction efficiency,” according to crypto historians. His technical expertise shaped XRP into one of the most prominent digital assets by market capitalization. Despite these contributions, Britto has intentionally kept a low profile. Unlike Schwartz and McCaleb, who have participated in interviews and public forums, Britto has avoided media exposure and rarely communicates publicly. HE CO-CREATED THE XRP LEDGER. HE HOLDS 2% OF ALL XRP. HE’S NEVER BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC. Arthur Britto might be the most important figure in crypto you’ve never heard of. Let’s dive into the mystery. pic.twitter.com/xKyiYXIpGY — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) July 5, 2025 His influence extends beyond his engineering contributions. A contractual arrangement from 2012 granted him ownership of approximately 2% of all XRP tokens. This sizable holding underscores both his foundational role in the project and his long-term commitment to XRP’s development. Comparisons to Satoshi Nakamoto Britto’s extreme privacy has fueled speculation and intrigue within the community. Some observers have drawn parallels to Bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto . The coincidence that Britto’s last public interaction occurred during the initial XRP Ledger launch has added fuel to these theories. However, there is no credible indication that Britto is Nakamoto, and this notion remains speculative. In June 2025, Britto broke his decade-long silence by posting a single emoji on X. That post was confirmed by Ripple CTO David Schwartz, highlighting its authenticity. Although the meaning behind the emoji remains unclear, it generated speculation that it may indicate forthcoming developments within the ecosystem. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ongoing Influence Through Blockchain Technology Although Britto maintains a low public presence, his engagement with blockchain technology continues. He is a co-founder of PolySign, a company focused on secure digital asset custody. PolySign evolved into Standard Custody & Trust Company and was subsequently integrated into Ripple’s custody services. These developments suggest that Britto’s influence extends beyond XRP Ledger protocol design and into institutional infrastructure for digital assets. Within XRP communities, rumors have circulated that Britto has predicted XRP could ultimately reach $10,000 per token. While intriguing, there is no confirmed statement or credible source supporting this claim. Although Arthur Britto rarely seeks attention, his technical contributions and token ownership establish him as a key contributor to Ripple’s foundation. He continues to drive blockchain innovation quietly, both through XRPL and institutional-grade custody services. While the full extent of his role remains undisclosed, analysts agree that Britto’s work continues to influence the strategic trajectory of XRP and Ripple.

Alden explains in a new analysis that people with specific payment issues like capital controls and payment de-platforming find BTC useful, but they can often also use less-volatile stablecoins as short-term solutions to those same problems. “There are some very well-meaning Bitcoin proponents trying to convince Bitcoin holders to spend it more. I don’t particularly view that as a sustainable practice. Bitcoin is not going to catch on as a charity. In order for spending it to catch on persistently at scale (i.e. not just billions of dollar-equivalents in annual global medium-of-exchange volume, but trillions), it has to solve problems for spenders and/or recipients that other solutions are not doing. And at this stage of adoption, that’s not necessarily the case, especially with capital gains taxes applicable to every single transaction and with options like stablecoins for near-term spending needs where volatility needs to be low.” Alden says Bitcoin instead has value due to its “optionality.” “Owning a sound, liquid, fungible, portable store of value that is going through its adoption phase gives the owner some perks, or options, that other assets do not. Mainly, they can bring their store of value wherever they want in the world without relying on central counterparties and credit. It also allows them to make crossborder payments, including to deplatformed recipients, through substantial friction even if they are staying put where they are. They might not be able to ubiquitously pay with it, but if need be they can find ways to convert it to local currency in most environments that they find themselves in, and in some cases can indeed pay with it directly.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

After months of uncertainty and price consolidation, a new analysis suggests that altcoins have just reclaimed a critical trendline—the same one that marked the beginning of the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. With market patterns aligning and fractals emerging, analysts are now questioning whether the conditions are once again ripe for a massive altcoin breakout. Altcoins Eye Vertical Move As Bear Trap Ends The altcoin market may be on the brink of a historic breakout, according to a recent chart analysis by crypto expert Merlijn The Trader. The analyst draws parallels between the current cycle and those of 2017 and 2021. The analyst’s chart, published on X social media, shows that the total altcoin market capitalization has reclaimed a long-term ascending trendline that had preceded previous vertical expansions during major bull runs. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Not Remotely Close, Bitcoin Dominance Still Too High: Market Expert Says In earlier cycles, altcoins briefly broke this trendline in what was identified as a “bear trap” before swiftly reversing and launching into explosive growth phases. Merlijin The Trader reveals that this pattern appears to be repeating in this cycle, as the current market structure mirrors previous setups that triggered rapid valuation increases across the altcoin sector. The ascending trendline recovery is framed within a red box in the chart, consistent with the zones that marked the end of prior downtrends. In each instance, the reclaim was followed by aggressive upward movement, highlighted by green boxes that represented parabolic gains in the total market cap. Merlijn The Trader suggests that the recent rebound indicates the completion of another bear trap, signaling renewed bullish momentum. Green arrows placed below the price curve, matching the timing of previous breakouts within the analyst’s chart, imply that the altcoin market could be preparing for another phase of expansion. If the historical fractal holds, the analyst forecasts a sharp vertical rally for altcoins, with valuations possibly reaching the $10-$16 trillion range. Altcoin Market Mirror 2016-2018 Breakout Setup In another fresh analysis, Merlijn The Trader noted that the altcoin market cap is showing signs of repeating a historical pattern that previously led to a major bull rally. A comparison between the 2016-2018 market cycle and the current one reveals an almost identical structure playing out, albeit on a much larger scale.

This same fractal unfolded before the explosive altcoin rally in 2017. The analyst’s chart also illustrates that in the previous cycle, altcoins broke out of this same wedge pattern, resulting in a massive surge in market capitalization, which he referred to as “Pump 2.0”. With the same breakout now confirmed for this cycle’s market structure, Merlijn The Trader predicts that the altcoin sector may be entering its next parabolic expansion phase. This development could mark the end of the altcoin market’s current bear phase and the beginning of a second macro pump similar to what occurred between 2017 and early 2018.

According to multiple experts, Dogecoin, SHIBA INU, and MAGACOIN FINANCE now rank among the top meme coins to buy for investors looking to catch the next big run. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The New Altcoin Movement Gaining Serious Momentum Launched as a decentralized political memecoin, MAGACOIN FINANCE has rapidly transformed into one of the most talked-about projects in the crypto space. It blends meme energy with cultural relevance, echoing the “Make America Great Again” movement while promoting a zero-tax model and full community control. But MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just riding a narrative — it’s backed by smart tokenomics and serious traction. The project is fully audited by HashEx, and the presale has already drawn thousands of investors. Multiple presale stages have sold out quickly, and the buzz across forums and Telegram groups suggests that entry points are closing fast. Analysts compare its rise to early Dogecoin and SHIBA INU — but highlight that MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a capped supply, no tax, and a more ideologically aligned, community-first approach. In a meme coin market often dominated by hype alone, this structure is giving MAGACOIN FINANCE a unique edge. With rumors of major exchange listings and expanding media coverage, many believe it could become the top-performing meme-powered altcoin in the months ahead. For early investors, the current phase presents a limited-time opportunity to get in before the next wave of demand hits. Dogecoin: The Original Meme King Holds Strong Dogecoin needs no introduction. As the original meme coin, it remains a symbol of community strength and viral market movements. While it has already seen explosive growth in previous cycles, analysts still rank DOGE as a long-term meme asset with potential for future rallies — especially if broader adoption picks up or Elon Musk reaffirms his support. Though Dogecoin’s growth story is well-documented, it now serves as a blueprint for spotting the next Doge-like run — which is exactly what experts see brewing in MAGACOIN FINANCE. SHIBA INU: A DeFi-Enabled Meme Ecosystem with Long-Term Potential SHIBA INU has come a long way from its meme beginnings. With its own decentralized exchange, token burns, and developer updates, SHIB has built out a full ecosystem. Experts still view SHIBA INU as one of the top meme coins with staying power, particularly given its community loyalty and growing utility. However, its massive supply and slower price movement have led some investors to explore earlier-stage opportunities with higher upside potential — like MAGACOIN FINANCE, which is still in its foundational growth phase. Final Thoughts: Why Experts Are Focusing on MAGACOIN FINANCE Dogecoin and SHIBA INU may have started the meme coin wave, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping the future . With a politically charged brand, fixed tokenomics, a zero-tax model, and a fast-growing base of holders, it represents the next evolution of the meme coin movement . Analysts say the timing is perfect. Momentum is building, investor entry is still early, and the opportunity to ride a high-reward asset before listings go live is narrowing quickly.

The news triggered a 5% price jump for the meme coin during Sunday trading in what appeared to be a buy-the-news event. A Shibarium-based launchpad continues the project pivot away from its speculative origins by building an ecosystem anchored in real utility and fundamentals. $LC x $SHIB x DegenSafe — the real alliance. This is just the beginning. The launchpad wars are getting serious. https://t.co/gJ7mCuBLeA https://t.co/03U1RycU8i pic.twitter.com/s50bAU1SAs — Degensafe.fun (@degensafefun) July 7, 2025 “From meme coins to mechanics, we’re reshaping what Web3 can be. DegenSafe is only the beginning,” Shiba Inu posted on X . The partnership could attract fresh retail liquidity into Shiba Inu, following the success of LetsBONK.fun —the first Solana meme coin launchpad to flip Pump.fun in volume. This may signal the start of a new meme coin trend, as speculative traders increasingly seek protection from the rug pulls, snipers, and bots that have become synonymous with Pump.fun. That said, Shiba Inu faces tough competition, lacking Solana’s high performance and ultra-low gas fees—a core contributor to the rise of platforms like LetsBONK and Pump.fun. Shiba Inu Price Analysis: Could Adoption Push a Surge? If DegenSafe sees adoption similar to Solana-based meme coin launchpads, it could give Shiba Inu the fuel it needs to break free from its 6-month consolidation range. SHIB / USDT 3-day chart, double bottom pattern. Source: TradingView, Binance. With its latest bounce from the lower support of the consolidation zone around $0.00001, the emergence of a double bottom pattern could see SHIB retest the $0.0000177 upper resistance. The MACD line is en route to surpass the signal line in a golden cross—the first since the Shiba Inu price last tested $0.0000177 in mid-May, suggesting a short-term uptrend may be forming. However, the RSI highlights a lack of conviction from buyers. Despite an uptrend signaling accumulation, it remains stuck below the neutral line, currently hovering in the low 40s. A fundamental catalyst like the DegenSafe launchpad could bring the adoption and fresh liquidity SHIB needs as the utility token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. If the double bottom breakout plays out, SHIB could see a 112% surge, targeting a higher resistance zone stretching back to early January at $0.000025. However, its full potential hinges on a successful break above its neckline—the $0.0000177 resistance of the consolidation zone. Before then, Immediate resistance at $0.000012 is the key level to watch—failure to break it risks a rejection and a 12% drop back to $0.00001, which would invalidate the pattern. Shiba Inu Has Lost Its Roots – The New Purest Meme Coin Could Take Its Place With Shiba Inu’s shift from pure speculation to real utility and fundamentals, it’s now the one creating the speculative plays. The truth is, SHIB has faded into the background for months as traders chased fresher narratives—on the speculative meme coin scene, attention is the fuel that drives price moves. Few stand to capitalize on this momentum as much as “mission coins”—the purest form of meme coin, fueled purely by a devoted community. We are at a pivot point. Dozens more launchpads will come. Millions of gamble coins will come and go. But only a handful of MISSION COINS will WIN. pic.twitter.com/rxsVfeux8A — Murad (@MustStopMurad) July 8, 2025 Token6900 ($T6900) is the latest chapter in that saga: no promises, no utility—because you are the utility.

Unsealed in the District of Puerto Rico, the indictment accuses Michael Shannon Sims, 48, of Georgia and Florida, and Juan Carlos Reynoso, 57, of New Jersey and Florida, of operating and promoting OmegaPro. This global crypto-based multi-level marketing operation promised investors up to 300% returns over 16 months through foreign exchange trading. “This case exposes the ruthless reality of modern financial crime,” said Guy Ficco, Chief of Criminal Investigations at the Internal Revenue Service. “OmegaPro promised financial freedom but delivered financial ruin.” Between 2019 and 2023, Sims, Reynoso, and other co-conspirators allegedly convinced thousands of victims worldwide to purchase crypto-based “investment packages,” falsely claiming the funds would be safely managed by elite forex traders, according to the Department of Justice. Prosecutors say the pair flaunted their lavish lifestyles online and hosted glitzy events to build investor trust — including one in Dubai where the OmegaPro logo was projected onto the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest skyscraper. A video posted on the company’s LinkedIn page shows attendees dressed in formal attire celebrating under the spectacle. The case underscores ongoing federal efforts to crack down on crypto fraud and multi-level marketing abuses in the digital asset space. Authorities say OmegaPro was a pyramid-style fraud disguised as a legitimate investment opportunity. After the firm claimed to have been hacked, the defendants told victims their funds had been moved to a new platform called Broker Group, according to the Department of Justice. However, users could never withdraw their money from OmegaPro or Broker Group. Sims and Reynoso now face charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, each carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The multiagency investigation was led by the Justice Department, FBI, IRS-Criminal Investigation, and Homeland Security Investigations, with assistance from international law enforcement partners. Cold-call crypto conmen jailed for $2M fraud in UK crackdown In another case, UK authorities have sentenced two men to prison for orchestrating a fraudulent cryptocurrency scheme that targeted 65 victims through cold calls. Raymondip Bedi and Patrick Mavanga posed as representatives of fake crypto consultancy firms, convincing individuals to invest in bogus ventures. Judge Martin Griffiths at Southwark Crown Court said the duo “conspired to drive a coach and horses through the regulatory system.” Operating between 2017 and 2019 under company names like CCX Capital and Astaria Group LLP, the pair defrauded victims of approximately $2.03 million (£1.5 million). Both Bedi and Mavanga pleaded guilty to multiple charges, including fraud, money laundering, and possessing false identification documents. Mavanga also received a separate conviction for perverting the course of justice after he was found to have deleted phone recordings linked to the scheme. Elliptic unveils key tools to help compliance teams combat $9.3B crypto scam surge Scams have rapidly become one of the most lucrative forms of illicit activity in the crypto space.

For years, investors and enthusiasts have dreamed of easier, regulated access to digital assets through traditional investment vehicles. Now, a significant step has been taken that could bring an XRP ETF closer to reality, sparking both excitement and a healthy dose of caution. What’s the Buzz Around the XRP ETF ? The recent news that ProShares XRP ‘s Ultra XRP ETF has been registered with The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) under the ticker “UXRP” has sent ripples through the crypto community. This isn’t just any registration; it signals a formal entry into the plumbing of traditional finance, making it a pivotal moment for those eyeing a regulated XRP ETF . What is the DTCC? The DTCC is a vital piece of infrastructure in the financial markets. It provides clearing, settlement, and information services for equities, corporate and municipal bonds, unit investment trusts, government and mortgage-backed securities, money market instruments, and over-the-counter derivatives. Essentially, it’s where securities are processed and settled. Why is this significant? Registration with the DTCC means the security has a CUSIP number, making it identifiable and tradable within the traditional financial system. It’s a prerequisite for any security that aims to be listed on major exchanges. What it isn’t: Crucially, as the initial report highlighted, this DTCC registration is entirely independent of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) review process. It does not guarantee listing or approval from the SEC. Think of it as getting a passport for a foreign country – you have the document, but you still need a visa (SEC approval) to enter and stay. ProShares XRP ‘s Strategic Play: Understanding the UXRP Offering ProShares is no stranger to the cryptocurrency ETF space, having been a pioneer with the first Bitcoin futures ETF. Their move to register an Ultra XRP ETF speaks volumes about their strategy and belief in the market’s demand for such products. Who is ProShares? ProShares is a leading provider of ETFs, known for offering a diverse range of products, including leveraged and inverse ETFs. Their expertise lies in structuring financial products that allow investors to gain exposure to various asset classes in a regulated environment. What is an “Ultra” ETF? The “Ultra” designation, combined with the “2x leveraged” detail, means this ETF aims to deliver twice the daily performance of XRP. If XRP goes up 1%, the ETF aims to go up 2%. Conversely, if XRP drops 1%, the ETF aims to drop 2%. This amplification of returns (and losses) makes it a high-risk, high-reward product, typically suited for sophisticated investors or short-term trading strategies. Why a leveraged cryptocurrency ETF ? Offering a leveraged product signals confidence in XRP’s potential for significant price movements. It also caters to a segment of the market looking to amplify their exposure without directly holding the underlying asset or engaging in complex derivatives. Decoding DTCC Registration : A Crucial Step, Not the Finish Line While the DTCC registration is a necessary step in the lifecycle of any publicly traded security, it’s essential to understand its specific role and limitations in the context of a cryptocurrency ETF . The DTCC’s Role: The DTCC acts as a central clearinghouse and depository. Its registration process primarily ensures that a security meets the operational and technical requirements for trading and settlement within the traditional financial system. It’s about infrastructure and plumbing, not about regulatory approval of the underlying asset or the investment vehicle’s suitability for public investors. Independence from SEC: This is the critical distinction. The DTCC does not evaluate the investment merits of a security or its compliance with securities laws. That falls squarely within the purview of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC’s mandate is investor protection, market integrity, and capital formation. What’s Next After DTCC Registration ? For the Ultra XRP ETF to become truly accessible to the public, it must still navigate the SEC’s rigorous review process. This involves filing an S-1 registration statement (or similar) and addressing any concerns the SEC might have regarding investor protection, market manipulation, custody, and valuation of the underlying digital asset. The Road Ahead: Navigating SEC Approval for Cryptocurrency ETF s The path to SEC approval for any cryptocurrency ETF , especially one directly tracking a digital asset like XRP, has historically been fraught with challenges. The SEC has long expressed concerns about market manipulation, custody, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. A History of Caution: For years, the SEC resisted approving spot Bitcoin ETFs, citing concerns that the underlying market was susceptible to manipulation and that adequate investor protections were not in place. It wasn’t until January 2024 that the first spot Bitcoin ETFs were finally approved, following extensive efforts by applicants to address these concerns. The Ripple vs. SEC Factor: XRP’s unique situation, stemming from the ongoing lawsuit between Ripple Labs and the SEC regarding whether XRP is an unregistered security, adds another layer of complexity. While a U.S. court ruled that XRP itself is not a security when sold to the general public on exchanges, the SEC continues its case regarding institutional sales. The clarity (or lack thereof) on XRP’s regulatory status is a significant hurdle for an XRP ETF . Leveraged ETF Scrutiny: Beyond the asset itself, a 2x leveraged ETF faces additional scrutiny. Leveraged products are inherently more complex and carry higher risks, making the SEC particularly cautious about their accessibility to retail investors. Key Considerations for SEC: Market Surveillance: Can the ETF issuer demonstrate sufficient surveillance-sharing agreements to prevent market manipulation? Custody: How will the underlying XRP be securely held and audited? Valuation: How will the ETF accurately price XRP in a volatile market? Investor Protection: Are the risks of a leveraged crypto product adequately disclosed and understood by potential investors? What This Means for Investors and the Broader Crypto Market The registration of ProShares’ Ultra XRP ETF with the DTCC, while not final approval, signifies growing institutional interest and infrastructure development around digital assets. Potential Benefits for Investors: Accessibility: If approved, an XRP ETF would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP through regulated brokerage accounts, without needing to navigate crypto exchanges, wallets, or private keys. Diversification: It offers another avenue for portfolio diversification within the digital asset space. Liquidity: ETFs are typically highly liquid, offering ease of entry and exit. Leveraged Exposure: For those with a high-risk tolerance and a bullish outlook, the 2x leverage offers amplified returns. Challenges and Risks: Volatility: XRP, like all cryptocurrencies, is highly volatile. A leveraged ETF amplifies this volatility, leading to potentially significant losses. Regulatory Uncertainty: The ongoing SEC lawsuit and general regulatory ambiguity surrounding crypto remain major risks. Tracking Error: Leveraged ETFs are designed to achieve their stated objectives over a single day. Over longer periods, compounding can lead to significant deviations from the underlying asset’s performance. Fees: ETFs come with management fees, which can eat into returns. Impact on the Broader Market: The continued push for cryptocurrency ETF s, including for assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, indicates a maturing market and increasing institutional comfort. Each step towards traditional finance integration can pave the way for broader adoption and legitimacy for the entire crypto ecosystem. It also highlights the growing demand from investors for regulated crypto investment products. Actionable Insights: For investors watching this space, here are some key takeaways: Stay Informed: Follow SEC filings and announcements closely. The S-1 filing, when it comes, will offer critical details. Understand the Product: A 2x leveraged ETF is not for everyone. Ensure you fully grasp the risks before considering investment. Monitor Regulatory Landscape: The outcome of the Ripple vs. SEC case will have significant implications for XRP’s future and the likelihood of an ETF. Diversify: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, especially in a volatile market. Conclusion: ProShares’ registration of its Ultra XRP ETF with the DTCC marks a notable, albeit preliminary, stride towards mainstream financial integration for XRP. It underscores the persistent demand for regulated crypto investment products and ProShares’ continued pioneering role in this arena. While the DTCC registration is a crucial operational milestone, the ultimate hurdle remains the stringent review and potential SEC approval . The journey for an XRP ETF is far from over, filled with regulatory complexities and market dynamics. However, each step forward, like this DTCC registration , fuels optimism for the future of crypto in traditional finance, signaling a slow but steady march towards broader acceptance and accessibility for digital assets. The coming months will be critical in determining if this bold move by ProShares XRP truly unlocks new possibilities for investors seeking exposure to XRP.

Companies often streamline operations to dedicate more bandwidth to core projects they believe will drive future growth and innovation. What is the EigenLayer Protocol, and Why is it Important? Before diving into EigenCloud, it’s essential to understand the foundation Eigen Labs has built: the EigenLayer protocol . EigenLayer is a groundbreaking restaking primitive on Ethereum, designed to extend Ethereum’s security to other decentralized applications (dApps) and middleware services. It allows staked ETH to be ‘restaked’ to secure additional networks, effectively creating a shared security layer. This mechanism offers several compelling benefits: Enhanced Security: By leveraging Ethereum’s massive staked capital, EigenLayer can provide robust security guarantees to new protocols without requiring them to bootstrap their own validator sets. Capital Efficiency: Stakers can earn additional yield by restaking their ETH, making their capital more productive. Innovation Hub: It enables a new wave of ‘Actively Validated Services’ (AVSs) – decentralized applications that rely on EigenLayer for their security, fostering rapid innovation in the blockchain space. The EigenLayer protocol has garnered immense attention and capital, becoming one of the most significant innovations in the Ethereum ecosystem. Its success underscores Eigen Labs’ capability to develop complex, impactful blockchain infrastructure. Diving into EigenCloud: The Future of Decentralized Cloud Computing? With the Eigen Labs layoffs , the spotlight now firmly shines on EigenCloud . But what exactly is EigenCloud, and why is Eigen Labs committing so many resources to it? While specific details are still emerging, the vision for EigenCloud is to build a robust, decentralized cloud computing platform. Imagine a cloud service that isn’t reliant on a single corporate entity like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud, but rather operates on a distributed network, leveraging blockchain principles for security, transparency, and censorship resistance. The concept of decentralized cloud is not new, but Eigen Labs’ approach, potentially integrating with the EigenLayer restaking mechanism, could be revolutionary. Key aspects of a decentralized cloud platform often include: Distributed Infrastructure: Resources (compute, storage, bandwidth) are provided by a network of participants rather than centralized data centers. Enhanced Privacy and Security: Data is encrypted and distributed, reducing single points of failure and attack vectors. Censorship Resistance: No single entity can shut down or control access to the services. Cost Efficiency: Potentially lower costs due to peer-to-peer resource sharing and reduced overhead. If EigenCloud successfully leverages the power of restaked ETH and the decentralized validator set, it could offer a compelling alternative for developers and enterprises seeking more resilient, transparent, and secure cloud infrastructure. This strategic pivot signals Eigen Labs’ belief that decentralized cloud computing is the next frontier for blockchain technology. What Does This Mean for Crypto Industry Trends?

With multiple sold-out stages and fresh demand daily, this meme-powered political altcoin is moving up the charts as a top analyst pick. Thousands of investors are lining up for MAGACOIN FINANCE as it continues to attract high-volume buyers. While XRP’s banking push has kept it in headlines, traders looking for early-stage growth are calling MAGACOIN FINANCE the next big play before wider listings hit the market. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming a Top Meme-Driven Altcoin MAGACOIN FINANCE is more than another meme coin. It’s positioning itself as a decentralized political altcoin with real traction. Its fixed supply of 170 billion tokens creates scarcity that smart traders look for in a breakout project. The contract is fully audited by Hashex, boosting trust for new investors. Earlier rounds sold out fast, and the latest stage is already seeing slots vanish every few hours. This zero-tax model makes it attractive for clean trades, while community control gives holders a voice in future decisions. It’s no surprise analysts are now comparing early MAGACOIN FINANCE momentum to the first days of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. By tapping into cultural and political themes, this project is drawing interest from retail buyers and large crypto funds alike. Many see it as one of the few coins blending meme power with real ideological energy. This is why MAGACOIN FINANCE is repeatedly ranked as a top meme altcoin for Q3 2025. MAGACOIN’s Growing Momentum and Limited Availability The urgency around MAGACOIN FINANCE is clear. Demand keeps pushing new price levels higher. Available slots in each stage are selling out rapidly, creating fear of missing out for traders who want in before bigger exchanges list the token. Market sentiment is now grouping MAGACOIN FINANCE with heavyweights like XRP and Ethereum on watchlists. This shows just how strong the narrative is. Unlike many meme coins, this one stands out for its focus on decentralization and anti-centralization stance. Crypto insiders say MAGACOIN FINANCE is still early, which means the biggest moves could come as the community grows. XRP Price Targets Still Climbing XRP is enjoying a fresh wave of interest as Ripple’s long court battle with the SEC nears the finish line. With regulatory clarity in sight, institutional players are watching closely. Ripple’s move to secure a national banking charter and a Federal Reserve master account could push XRP deeper into the regulated finance space. Analysts expect XRP to trade between $2.32 and $2.80 in Q3 if it breaks above key resistance levels. Some see a possible rally to $6.50–$8 or even $10 if ETF speculation heats up and banking moves deliver results. These factors keep XRP on the radar for traders seeking stable growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE Ranks as the Better Q3 Play While XRP holds strong appeal for institutional growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is winning trader attention as the best crypto to buy for big Q3 upside. With its capped supply, massive analyst support, and fast-selling stages, it offers an early position that XRP can’t match right now. Thousands of investors already see MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next top meme coin with real political and cultural staying power. Analysts also project a potential to jump 30x by the end of 2025. Demand is moving fast, and slots keep filling. Those looking for the next breakout altcoin won’t want to miss this chance.

This latest call, highlighted by the Walter Bloomberg economic news account on X, reignites a long-standing debate about the independence of the central bank and the direction of U.S. economic policy . For those navigating the volatile waters of cryptocurrency, understanding these macroeconomic pressures is crucial, as Fed decisions often ripple across all asset classes, including digital currencies. Why is Trump Pushing for Rate Cuts from the Trump Fed ? Donald Trump’s consistent advocacy for lower interest rates stems from a belief that such a move would stimulate economic growth, boost the stock market, and make borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. His latest comments on Truth Social underscore a recurring theme from his presidency: a desire for the Federal Reserve to adopt a more accommodative monetary stance. During his time in office, Trump frequently criticized Powell for not cutting rates aggressively enough, arguing that higher rates were hindering the U.S. economy’s full potential. The argument for rate cuts often centers on several key points: Stimulating Growth: Lower interest rates reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses, encouraging investment, expansion, and job creation. For consumers, it means cheaper mortgages and loan payments, potentially boosting spending. Combating Deflationary Pressures: In an environment where prices are falling or stagnating, rate cuts can help prevent deflation, which can be detrimental to an economy. Weakening the Dollar: Lower rates can make a country’s currency less attractive to foreign investors, potentially leading to a weaker dollar. This can make exports cheaper and more competitive, benefiting domestic industries. Market Boost: Historically, lower rates have often been associated with rising stock markets, as companies’ borrowing costs decrease and future earnings become more valuable. The Federal Reserve’s Independent Stance and Jerome Powell ‘s Dilemma At the heart of this discussion is the Federal Reserve’s role as an independent central bank. The Fed operates with a dual mandate from Congress: to achieve maximum employment and maintain price stability (low and stable inflation). This independence is designed to insulate monetary policy decisions from short-term political pressures, allowing the Fed to make choices based on economic data and long-term stability goals. Jerome Powell , as the current Chairman, has repeatedly emphasized the Fed’s commitment to its dual mandate and its data-dependent approach. His decisions are not made in isolation but are the result of deliberations by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which assesses a wide range of economic indicators, including: Inflation rates (Consumer Price Index, Personal Consumption Expenditures) Employment data (unemployment rate, job growth, wage growth) GDP growth Consumer spending and business investment Global economic conditions The challenge for Powell and the Fed is balancing the desire for economic growth with the need to control inflation. Cutting rates too soon or too aggressively could reignite inflationary pressures, eroding purchasing power and creating economic instability. Conversely, holding rates too high for too long could stifle economic activity and lead to a recession. The Ripple Effect: How Interest Rate Cuts Impact Markets, Including Crypto Monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve have profound effects across all financial markets. When the Fed signals or implements interest rate cuts , several dynamics come into play: Market Type Potential Impact of Rate Cuts Explanation Traditional Stocks (Equities) Generally Positive Lower borrowing costs for companies, higher corporate profits, and increased investor appetite for riskier assets over bonds. Bonds (Fixed Income) Yields Fall, Prices Rise Existing bonds with higher yields become more attractive. New bonds will be issued at lower yields. Real Estate Generally Positive Lower mortgage rates make homeownership more affordable, boosting demand and property values. Commodities (e.g., Gold) Mixed, Often Positive A weaker dollar (often a result of lower rates) makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for foreign buyers. Gold can also act as an inflation hedge if rate cuts lead to inflation. Cryptocurrencies Often Positive (Risk-On) Lower interest rates can reduce the attractiveness of traditional safe-haven assets and yield-bearing instruments, pushing investors towards higher-risk, higher-reward assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Increased liquidity in the system can also flow into crypto. For the crypto market, a ‘risk-on’ environment, often fostered by lower rates and abundant liquidity, tends to be beneficial. When traditional investments offer lower returns, the allure of potentially higher gains in digital assets increases. Conversely, a ‘risk-off’ environment, driven by high rates or economic uncertainty, can lead investors to pull funds from speculative assets like crypto. The Broader Implications of Trump’s Stance on Economic Policy Trump’s repeated public demands on the Fed highlight a fundamental tension between political leadership and central bank independence. While politicians often prefer policies that can stimulate short-term growth and appease voters, central bankers are tasked with maintaining long-term economic stability, which sometimes requires unpopular decisions. The former President’s use of Truth Social as a direct communication channel amplifies his message, ensuring it reaches a wide audience and keeps the pressure on policymakers. This dynamic creates uncertainty for markets. Investors constantly weigh the potential for political influence on monetary policy against the Fed’s stated commitment to independence. Any perceived shift in the Fed’s stance due to external pressure could lead to market volatility, as participants adjust their expectations for future interest rate decisions. What to Watch For: Navigating Future Fed Decisions As the debate around interest rates continues, market participants, including crypto investors, should pay close attention to several key indicators and announcements: FOMC Meetings: The Federal Open Market Committee meets eight times a year to discuss and set monetary policy. The statements and press conferences following these meetings provide crucial insights into the Fed’s outlook. Inflation Data: Key inflation reports like the CPI (Consumer Price Index) and PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) are primary drivers of Fed decisions. Sustained declines in inflation could pave the way for cuts. Employment Reports: The monthly jobs report (Non-Farm Payrolls, unemployment rate) offers a snapshot of the labor market, a key component of the Fed’s dual mandate. Speeches by Fed Officials: Public comments from Jerome Powell and other Fed governors can offer hints about future policy direction. Understanding these signals can help investors anticipate potential shifts in the macroeconomic landscape and position their portfolios accordingly, whether in traditional assets or the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies. Conclusion: The Enduring Battle Over Interest Rates Donald Trump’s latest call for interest rate cuts from Jerome Powell via Truth Social is more than just a political statement; it’s a stark reminder of the ongoing tension between political aspirations and the independent mandate of the Federal Reserve. While Trump advocates for policies he believes will accelerate economic growth, the Fed remains committed to balancing employment and price stability through its carefully considered economic policy . For investors, particularly those in the crypto space, these macroeconomic currents are vital. The Fed’s decisions on rates directly influence liquidity, risk appetite, and the broader financial environment, shaping the trajectory of digital assets. As this high-stakes economic dialogue continues, staying informed about the Fed’s actions and the rationale behind them will be paramount for navigating the markets successfully.

This new feature could completely change how people trade crypto derivatives by making them simpler and more accessible. Perpetual futures now see more than $100 billion in trading volume daily. That said, most of the platforms that offer these products have been centralized exchanges, which are overloaded with complex charts, order books, and technical tools, which can be off-putting for non-professional users. Phantom is trying to democratize this kind of trading. Instead of forcing users to shift assets between platforms or learn about trading abstractions, Phantom allows them to trade perpetual futures without ever leaving their wallets. They also simplified the entire process, deposit with SOL, and let the wallet swap to USDC automatically. From the next screen, they select a market and pick their desired leverage. No complex user interfaces or any financial jargon. The platform’s experience is sleek and mobile-friendly so that users can open leveraged positions as effortlessly as they handle NFTs or make a token swap. No other Crypto wallet goes this simple. Phantom can onboard millions of new users locked out of the derivatives market by building this high-level trading functionality into its user interface. Phantom taps Hyperliquid to bring fast, gas-free perpetual to everyday traders Phantom’s latest perpetual futures have been built on Hyperliquid , a rapidly scaling Layer 2 decentralized trade protocol with high-speed infrastructure and zero gas fees. Thanks to this integration, Phantom users can now trade across over 100 diverse markets in the same app they already use to manage their tokens and NFTs. They cover all major markets, including BTC, ETH, and SOL, as well as emerging altcoins such as AVAX, ARB, and LINK. The system even holds high-volatility meme coins like Dogecoin, Pepe, and Bonk, leaving traders with plenty of choice if they want to take a risk on high-risk speculation. So, Hyperliquid deals with the nitty and gritty, like order execution and risk management, and Phantom is the beautiful and user-friendly interface. The result is a complete trading tool that can get anyone hands-on with advanced trading tools. Phantom suggested this is just the start in a blog post discussing the news. The team hopes to expand the feature set, adding more educational tools and social features to help make derivatives trading more accessible and engaging for beginners. Phantom’s Futures feature sparks debate on risk and accessibility Phantom’s innovation is well-received among the crypto community but is also a cause for concern. Perpetual futures are high-risk financial products. They enable traders to raise the stakes but also the risk of losses. A bad trade at 40x leverage may end quickly and suddenly, liquidating, especially if markets are turbulent. Professional traders have tools for managing risk, stopping losses, hedge strategies, and complex data analyses that protect them. Casual users often don’t. By putting derivatives just a few taps away, Phantom might also bring these risks to a new generation of unprepared users. Its critics say that ease of access could encourage reckless trading, especially among younger or novice investors. The Phantom team still stresses responsible use. The platform features warnings, educational pop-ups, and even an explicit disclaimer before a user can open a futures position. The feature is also opt-in, so you must consent to the risks before taking advantage of it. And Phantom’s ambitious move amounts to a litmus test for whether retailers will adopt crypto derivatives. It’s a sign that wallets can’t simply be repositories anymore; they are evolving into full-blown financial ecosystems. If successful, this move could change the purpose of self-custody wallets, transforming them into potential primary investments and eventually, trading and earning platforms. In the wrong hands, it could leave a generation of over-leveraged, under-informed users tangled in the volatility of crypto markets.

A recent announcement from the U.S. Treasury Department serves as a stark reminder of this reality, highlighting the persistent threat posed by state-sponsored cyber criminals. This time, the focus is squarely on North Korea and its audacious attempts to fund its illicit programs through digital means. US Sanctions North Korea: A Direct Response to Digital Threats In a significant move to counter global cybercrime and illicit finance, the U.S. Treasury has taken decisive action, imposing US sanctions North Korea . Specifically, the sanctions target North Korean national Song Kum Hyok. His alleged role? Orchestrating the placement of DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) IT workers into unsuspecting foreign companies. But these weren’t just any IT workers; they were reportedly covert operatives, leveraging their positions for cyber espionage and, crucially, for massive cryptocurrency thefts. This action underscores the U.S. government’s commitment to disrupting North Korea’s ability to generate revenue through illegal cyber activities, which directly funds its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile programs. The Treasury’s statement made it clear: Song Kum Hyok facilitated the deployment of these workers, who then exploited their access to company networks. This isn’t just about financial theft; it’s about national security. The funds generated are then funneled back to the regime, fueling its dangerous ambitions. This sanction serves as a warning to companies worldwide to enhance their due diligence, especially when hiring remote IT personnel, as the threat of infiltration is real and carries severe consequences. Unmasking North Korean IT Workers and Their Global Reach How do these North Korean IT workers operate, and why are they so effective? It’s a sophisticated scheme. These individuals often present themselves as freelance developers or employees of legitimate-looking front companies. They leverage their technical skills to gain employment in various sectors, from IT services to software development and even finance. Once embedded, they can engage in a range of malicious activities: Intellectual Property Theft: Stealing sensitive company data, designs, or proprietary software. Network Exploitation: Gaining unauthorized access to internal systems for future attacks or data exfiltration. Financial Fraud: Directly participating in or facilitating cryptocurrency thefts and other financial crimes. These workers are often highly skilled and operate under strict instructions from the DPRK government. Their primary goal is to generate hard currency, bypassing international sanctions that restrict North Korea’s access to traditional financial systems. The anonymity and speed offered by cryptocurrency make it an attractive target for these state-sponsored operatives, allowing them to move large sums of money across borders with relative ease. The Alarming Rise of Crypto Cyber Activity by DPRK: What’s the Impact? The DPRK’s reliance on crypto cyber activity has surged in recent years, becoming a cornerstone of its illicit fundraising strategy. These activities range from direct hacks of cryptocurrency exchanges and decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to sophisticated phishing campaigns targeting individual crypto holders. The sheer scale of these operations is staggering, with estimates suggesting billions of dollars stolen over the past few years. But what does this mean for the average crypto user or investor? The impact is multifaceted: Erosion of Trust: High-profile hacks undermine confidence in the security of the crypto ecosystem. Financial Losses: Individuals and companies suffer direct financial losses from stolen assets. Regulatory Scrutiny: Increased illicit activity leads to greater regulatory oversight, potentially impacting innovation and accessibility. Reputational Damage: Projects and platforms that are successfully attacked face significant reputational harm. It’s a constant cat-and-mouse game between cybersecurity experts, law enforcement, and these persistent threat actors. Every successful theft not only enriches the regime but also provides valuable intelligence and techniques for future attacks. The Shadowy Operations of the Lazarus Group: Who Are They? When discussing North Korea’s cyber capabilities, it’s impossible to ignore the notorious Lazarus Group . This state-sponsored hacking collective is widely recognized as one of the most prolific and dangerous cyber threat actors globally. Active since at least 2009, the Lazarus Group has been implicated in a string of high-profile cyberattacks, including the 2014 Sony Pictures hack, the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, and numerous cryptocurrency heists. Their methods are diverse, employing everything from sophisticated social engineering to zero-day exploits. Their connection to the North Korean government is well-documented by intelligence agencies worldwide. They serve as a vital arm of the regime, tasked with generating funds and conducting espionage. In the crypto space, their exploits are particularly infamous: Ronin Bridge Hack (2022): One of the largest crypto heists in history, with over $600 million stolen from Axie Infinity’s Ronin Network. Harmony Horizon Bridge Hack (2022): Another significant breach, resulting in over $100 million in stolen crypto. Numerous Exchange Hacks: Throughout the years, many centralized exchanges have fallen victim to Lazarus Group’s sophisticated attacks. Their operations are characterized by meticulous planning, advanced technical skills, and a relentless pursuit of financial gain for their benefactors. Understanding their tactics is crucial for anyone involved in the digital asset space. Tracing and Combatting Illicit Crypto Funds: A Global Challenge Once stolen, these illicit crypto funds don’t just disappear. They enter a complex web of laundering techniques designed to obscure their origins and make them usable by the North Korean regime. This is where the global fight against financial crime truly comes into play. Tracing these funds requires sophisticated blockchain analytics tools and international cooperation. Common laundering methods include: Mixers/Tumblers: Services that pool and mix cryptocurrencies from various sources to obscure transaction trails. Chain Hopping: Converting one cryptocurrency to another multiple times across different blockchains. Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) and Cross-Chain Bridges: Leveraging these platforms to move funds rapidly and anonymously. Shell Companies and Sanctioned Entities: Using front companies or sanctioned individuals to facilitate transfers through traditional financial systems once crypto is converted to fiat. The challenge lies in the decentralized nature of blockchain and the speed at which transactions occur. However, significant progress is being made. Blockchain analytics firms like Chainalysis and Elliptic work closely with law enforcement agencies to trace these funds, often identifying patterns and ultimately leading to seizures or arrests. International bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) also play a critical role in setting global standards for anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) in the crypto space. What Can You Do? Actionable Insights for Security While governments and law enforcement work to combat these large-scale threats, individual crypto users and businesses also have a role to play. Here are some actionable insights: Strong Security Practices: Always use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on all your crypto accounts and email. Be Wary of Phishing: Double-check URLs, email senders, and never click on suspicious links. Scammers often impersonate legitimate entities. Hardware Wallets: For significant holdings, consider using a hardware wallet, which keeps your private keys offline. Software Updates: Keep all your software, operating systems, and antivirus programs updated to patch known vulnerabilities. Due Diligence for Hiring: Companies, especially those in tech, must implement robust background checks and verification processes for remote hires to prevent infiltration by malicious actors like the North Korean IT workers. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest cybersecurity threats and best practices in the crypto space. A Resilient Stand Against Digital Malice The U.S. Treasury’s sanction against Song Kum Hyok is more than just a punitive measure; it’s a clear signal that the international community is intensifying its efforts to dismantle North Korea’s illicit financial networks. The convergence of state-sponsored cyber warfare and cryptocurrency presents a formidable challenge, but one that is being met with increasing sophistication and collaboration. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, so too must our defenses. Vigilance, strong security protocols, and global cooperation are our strongest weapons in ensuring the integrity of the crypto ecosystem and preventing it from being exploited by those who seek to sow chaos and fund dangerous agendas.

Recently, the U.S. stock market delivered a mixed performance, leaving investors pondering the immediate implications and future trajectory. While the numbers might seem small at first glance, these subtle shifts in the U.S. Stock Market Trends often signal deeper currents that can influence everything from tech giants to Bitcoin’s price action. U.S. Stock Market Trends: What Do the Mixed Signals Mean? The recent close saw the three major U.S. stock indexes diverging, a scenario that often reflects underlying uncertainties rather than a clear market direction. This mixed bag performance highlights a market grappling with various forces, where different sectors react distinctly to prevailing economic narratives. Understanding these U.S. Stock Market Trends is crucial for any investor, traditional or crypto-focused. S&P 500: -0.07% – This broad market index, representing 500 of the largest U.S. companies, experienced a slight dip, indicating a cautious stance among a wide range of investors. Nasdaq Composite: +0.07% – Heavily weighted towards technology and growth stocks, Nasdaq’s marginal gain suggests resilience in the tech sector, perhaps driven by specific company news or continued enthusiasm for innovation. Dow Jones Industrial Average: -0.37% – Comprising 30 large, publicly owned companies, the Dow’s more pronounced decline points to headwinds faced by traditional industrial and financial sectors. This could be due to concerns over interest rates, inflation, or broader economic slowdowns affecting established businesses. Dissecting the Stock Market Performance: What Drove the Divergence? Why did these major indexes behave so differently? The nuanced Stock Market Performance can be attributed to several factors, underscoring the complexity of current market dynamics where a single narrative rarely dictates the entire market’s direction. Instead, it’s a tapestry woven from multiple threads of economic data and corporate actions, directly influencing overall Stock Market Performance . Sectoral Rotation: Investors might be shifting capital between different sectors. For instance, defensive sectors (utilities, consumer staples) might see inflows during uncertain times, while cyclical sectors (industrials, financials) could face pressure. Company-Specific News: Earnings reports, product launches, or regulatory announcements from influential companies within each index can sway their overall direction. A strong earnings report from a tech giant on Nasdaq could offset declines elsewhere. Interest Rate Expectations: Speculation around the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates significantly impacts growth stocks (Nasdaq) more than value stocks (often found in Dow/S&P). Higher rates make future earnings less attractive, especially for companies relying on cheap capital. Inflation Concerns: Persistent inflation can erode corporate profits and consumer purchasing power, impacting the broader market. Different sectors have varying abilities to pass on increased costs to consumers. Global Economic Outlook: How Does it Influence Market Movements? Beyond immediate market reactions, the broader Global Economic Outlook plays a pivotal role in shaping investor confidence and asset prices. These macroeconomic headwinds and tailwinds create a complex environment that filters down to individual company performance and, consequently, the major stock indexes. A cautious Global Economic Outlook often translates into a more volatile and uncertain market. Inflationary Pressures: Central banks worldwide are battling inflation, leading to aggressive interest rate hikes. This impacts borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially slowing economic growth. Geopolitical Tensions: Conflicts and political instability in various regions can disrupt supply chains, increase commodity prices, and create uncertainty, pushing investors towards safer assets or causing broad market sell-offs. Supply Chain Disruptions: Lingering issues from the pandemic and recent geopolitical events continue to affect the production and distribution of goods, leading to higher costs and reduced corporate profitability. Energy Prices: Fluctuations in oil and gas prices can significantly impact transportation costs, manufacturing, and consumer spending, directly influencing corporate earnings and economic stability. Decoding Market Sentiment: What’s Driving Investor Psychology? While economic data and corporate earnings provide the fundamental backbone, Market Sentiment acts as the invisible hand, often dictating short-term price movements. The mixed close we observed is a direct reflection of conflicting sentiments among investors. Understanding and anticipating shifts in Market Sentiment is as crucial as analyzing balance sheets, especially in today’s interconnected financial world where emotions can amplify market swings. Cautious Optimism: Some investors might see opportunities in specific sectors or believe that inflation is peaking, leading to small gains in certain areas. Fear of Recession: Others might be pulling back, fearing an impending economic downturn, which leads to declines in more vulnerable sectors. Uncertainty and Indecision: The slight movements indicate that a significant portion of the market is in a ‘wait-and-see’ mode, lacking conviction for a strong directional move. This indecision often leads to choppy, range-bound trading. The Role of News Cycles: Daily headlines, from inflation reports to central bank speeches, can dramatically shift sentiment, creating knee-jerk reactions that may not always align with long-term fundamentals. Cryptocurrency Market Impact: How Do Stock Ripples Affect Crypto? Given the increasing correlation between traditional markets and digital assets, the performance of the U.S. Stock Market Trends invariably sends ripples into the cryptocurrency space. While crypto markets often march to their own beat, they are not entirely immune to the macroeconomic forces influencing stocks. The mixed close in the stock market serves as a reminder that even for crypto enthusiasts, keeping an eye on traditional financial indicators is essential. The interconnectedness means that significant shifts in the Cryptocurrency Market Impact can often be traced back to broader economic and financial market trends. Bitcoin’s Role as a Bellwether: Bitcoin, often seen as ‘digital gold’ by some and a ‘risk-on’ asset by others, frequently mirrors the movements of risk assets like tech stocks. A cautious stock market can lead to consolidation or minor pullbacks in Bitcoin, influencing the broader crypto market. Altcoin Volatility: Altcoins, generally more volatile than Bitcoin, tend to amplify the movements seen in Bitcoin. If Bitcoin reacts negatively to stock market weakness, altcoins can experience more significant declines. Liquidity Flows: When traditional markets face uncertainty, institutional and retail investors might reallocate capital, potentially drawing liquidity away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies or, conversely, seeking them as a hedge if they view them as non-correlated (though this view is currently less prevalent). Regulatory Environment: While not directly tied to daily stock movements, the overall regulatory climate for both traditional finance and crypto is influenced by the prevailing economic outlook. A tightening financial environment can lead to increased scrutiny on nascent industries like crypto. Challenges and Opportunities for Investors This mixed market signal presents both challenges and opportunities. The challenge lies in navigating the uncertainty and avoiding impulsive decisions based on short-term fluctuations. However, it also creates opportunities for strategic positioning: For Stock Investors: It might be a time to re-evaluate portfolios, focusing on quality companies with strong fundamentals that can weather economic headwinds. Diversification across sectors and asset classes becomes even more critical. For Crypto Investors: This period could be an opportune time for dollar-cost averaging into preferred assets or exploring projects with strong utility and long-term vision, rather than chasing speculative gains. Understanding the broader economic context helps in making informed decisions about your potential Cryptocurrency Market Impact . Actionable Insights for Navigating a Mixed Market How can you make sense of these complex signals and position yourself effectively? Stay Informed: Continuously monitor both traditional financial news and crypto-specific developments. Knowledge is your strongest defense against volatility. Diversify Your Portfolio: Don’t put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio, including a mix of traditional assets and cryptocurrencies, can help mitigate risks. Define Your Risk Tolerance: Understand how much risk you’re comfortable taking and adjust your investment strategy accordingly. This is particularly important when considering the potential Cryptocurrency Market Impact from traditional market movements. Long-Term Perspective: While daily fluctuations grab headlines, successful investing often hinges on a long-term view. Focus on the fundamentals and the potential for future growth rather than short-term noise. Consider Professional Advice: For complex financial decisions, consulting a financial advisor can provide personalized insights tailored to your goals. Summary: What Does a Mixed Close Truly Mean? The recent mixed close of the U.S. stock markets – with the S&P 500 and Dow dipping while Nasdaq held steady – is more than just a set of numbers. It’s a clear indicator of a market wrestling with conflicting forces, from inflation concerns to technological resilience. This nuanced Stock Market Performance reflects broader shifts in the Global Economic Outlook and directly influences Market Sentiment . For those in the digital asset space, understanding these U.S. Stock Market Trends is paramount, as the Cryptocurrency Market Impact is increasingly evident. In an era of interconnected finance, vigilance, diversification, and a long-term perspective remain the cornerstones of navigating these complex waters.

Trump’s comment was made in front of reporters after a question about the Federal Reserve’s renovation project, which has been under scrutiny. “Then he should resign immediately,” Trump said. “We should get somebody in there that’s going to lower interest rates.” Trump repeated that Powell was a “terrible” choice and made it clear he wants someone in charge of the Fed who will stop keeping borrowing costs high. According to Bloomberg, Trump has already been looking at replacements and plans to pick someone new when Powell’s term ends in May 2026. The president said last month he has three to four names on his list, all of whom he believes will support his push to cut rates. Trump boosts calls to investigate the Fed Criticism of Powell isn’t coming from Trump alone. Bill Pulte, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, told lawmakers that Powell’s testimony about the ongoing renovations at the Fed’s headquarters was misleading. Pulte publicly called for an investigation into Powell’s statements, describing them as “deceptive.” Trump later amplified Pulte’s demand on social media, pushing for Powell’s resignation again. The Fed’s headquarters renovation project has drawn media attention for its skyrocketing costs and alleged extravagant features. During a Senate hearing, Powell said some of the reporting was “misleading and inaccurate in many, many respects.” Still, pressure from Trump and his allies continued to build. Trump has already taken shots at Powell for holding rates steady, saying his economic policies are being held hostage by a “stubborn mule and a stupid person.” He’s also contradicted himself on whether Powell will be fired, posting that “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” before later saying he has “no intention of firing him.” The central bank kept rates unchanged in June, holding them in the 4.25% to 4.5% range, where they’ve been since December. Powell told Congress that inflation trends would normally justify a rate cut, but uncertainty caused by tariff policies has forced the Fed to wait. Powell emphasized there’s no urgent need to make changes, and the bank will act carefully to avoid making things worse. Bessent distances himself from Fed rumors While Powell’s position becomes shakier, speculation has already started about who might be chosen to replace him. One name floated in DC circles is Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary. But Bessent pushed back against that during an interview with Maria Bartiromo on FOX Business. Speaking on Mornings with Maria , he said, “I think I have the best job in Washington. I get to interact with the president. The Cabinet that he’s chosen is fantastic, and being part of that Cabinet is the dream of a lifetime for me.” Bessent didn’t rule it out, though. He added, “I will go where the president thinks that I am best suited.” Bessent previously worked in finance and joined the administration from the hedge fund world. He’s shown he can represent Trump’s interests abroad. Earlier this year, he traveled to Switzerland with Jamieson Greer, the US Trade Representative, to help settle trade tensions with China. The two worked to find a soft landing amid heated tariff negotiations, making Bessent one of Trump’s key players when it comes to international economic strategy. Trump’s criticism of Powell isn’t new, but the timing of this latest push, combined with calls for investigations and talk of deception, shows a more aggressive stance from the White House. With Powell’s term ending in 2026, Trump is already shaping the future of the Federal Reserve. For now, Powell is still in his job.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. As Asia begins its Wednesday trading day, bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade rangebound without any dominant market-moving headlines. The world's largest digital asset is trading above $108,900, according to CoinDesk market data , and the CoinDesk 20 index, a measure of the performance of the largest digital assets, is above 3,100, up 1.7%. Right now, what separates bitcoin's drift to $110K from a rally is market conviction, say observers. In a recent report, Glassnode highlighted that spot volumes for BTC continue to linger below their usual statistical bands, ETF flows contracted sharply from recent highs, and institutional investors appear hesitant despite the climbing unrealized gains shown in elevated ETF Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratios. In a market update from earlier this week, Wintermute describes this cautious environment as a ""barbell market,"" pointing out a stark divide between renewed enthusiasm in high-beta assets, like memecoins, and the stability of established large-cap tokens. Last year's narrative darlings, notably AI and DePIN tokens, have lost investor attention, indicating that traders are rotating into memecoins, many of the majors like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE are up over 8% in the last week, or staying in BTC and ETH, which are seen as battle-tested and secure. With global equities largely shrugging off geopolitical uncertainties, BTC's hesitancy underscores lingering caution among traders, suggesting the market awaits clearer signals before breaking decisively higher. Things are likely to remain rangebound until that changes. News Recap: $100M Fund Backs Builders, Not Bettors, on Bitcoin Bitcoin-only VC firm Ego Death Capital has closed a $100 million second fund aimed at backing projects that treat Bitcoin as infrastructure, not a speculative trade, CoinDesk previously reported . The fund will target Series A rounds between $3 million and $8 million for startups solving real-world problems using Bitcoin’s base layer or its scaling solutions. “We’re investing in businesses that treat Bitcoin not as a trade, but as infrastructure—something to build on, not bet on,” said general partner Lyn Alden. Ego’s existing portfolio includes Relai, a self-custody app, and Roxom, a securities exchange built directly on Bitcoin rails. At a time when multichain VCs are chasing yield on every new L2 and L3, Ego’s thesis is a bet on simplicity and durability: Bitcoin’s dominance remains above 60%, and the fund aims to capitalize on its staying power. The message to allocators: ignore the hype, back the rails that last. News Recap: Judge Bars Sanctions Talk in Tornado Cash Trial, Limits Free Speech Defense A federal judge has ruled that the U.S. government's sanctions against Tornado Cash, which were imposed in 2022 and later overturned, cannot be discussed in the upcoming criminal trial of developer Roman Storm, CoinDesk previously reported . Judge Katherine Polk Failla said allowing the jury to hear about the now-invalid sanctions would require ""mental gymnastics"" and risk confusing the core legal issues at trial. The sanctions were originally imposed by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) over alleged use of the mixer by North Korea’s Lazarus Group, but were struck down earlier this year in a separate case, Van Loon v. Treasury . Storm faces multiple criminal charges related to his role in building Tornado Cash, a privacy tool that allows users to obscure the origin of crypto transactions. Prosecutors allege that he profited substantially from the project, citing evidence of multi-million-dollar TORN token sales and real estate purchases. Judge Failla also ruled that evidence obtained from fellow Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev’s phone can be admitted at trial, despite objections from Storm’s legal team who argued the material was cherry-picked and not independently verifiable. Although Storm is free to speak about his belief in privacy and civil liberties, the judge said he will not be allowed to frame his actions as protected under the First Amendment. The court drew a distinction between personal beliefs and legal defenses. A final pre-trial hearing is scheduled for Friday, with the trial slated to begin on June 14 and expected to last four weeks. The outcome of the case is likely to set an important precedent for how U.S. courts treat developers of open-source privacy tools. Market Movements: BTC : Bitcoin maintained institutional-grade resilience during the July 7–8 trading cycle, holding above the key $108,000 level while navigating heavy resistance at $109,200 and finding strategic support near $107,470, signaling continued confidence from corporate treasuries despite late-session profit-taking, according to CoinDesk's market insights bot. ETH: Ethereum rose 3% to $2,610 during the July 7–8 session as institutional investors deployed $515 million in coordinated weekend buying, driving volumes to nearly triple the average and pushing the asset through key resistance levels Gold: Gold fell 1.2% to below $3,300 on Tuesday as optimism over delayed reciprocal tariffs and hopes for new trade deals weakened safe-haven demand, while markets awaited FOMC minutes for further rate guidance. Nikkei 225: Asian markets traded mixed Wednesday as Japan’s Nikkei 225 edged down 8.39 points (0.021%) after U.S. President Trump ruled out delaying August 1 tariffs, imposed a 50% duty on copper imports, and warned of potential 200% pharmaceutical tariffs with an 18-month grace period. S&P 500: The S&P 500 closed nearly unchanged on Tuesday after President Donald Trump confirmed there would be no exemptions to the August 1 tariff rollout.

The merger is expected to close sometime between October and December this year, and the company is aiming to raise over $1 billion in the process. The company says it will manage a crypto portfolio that includes bitcoin, ethereum, and Solana, and plans to align its strategy with the U.S. strategic crypto reserve. The entire push is part of a broader effort to package crypto into equity to make it more appealing to institutional investors. The idea isn’t new. Michael Saylor’s company, MicroStrategy, did something similar in 2020 when it switched to a bitcoin-centered model and saw its stock price explode. ReserveOne is following that same model but throwing in more firepower from the top. ReserveOne adds crypto insiders and ex-Trump official to board Jaime Leverton, who previously ran crypto mining company Hut 8, is leading ReserveOne as CEO. Jaime said the firm’s upper-level team stands out because of its deep ties to finance, regulation, and crypto. “Our management team and anticipated board of directors bring a really unique pedigree and diversity of background between Wall Street and regulatory and crypto,” she told Reuters. Sebastian Bea, who previously held senior roles at BlackRock and Coinbase Asset Management, will take over as president and lead investment strategy. The board will be chaired by Reeve Collins, one of the co-founders of Tether, the largest stablecoin company. It’ll also include Chinh Chu, formerly at Blackstone, and Wilbur Ross, the former U.S. Secretary of Commerce under President Donald Trump. Jaime said Wilbur was skeptical of crypto at first but “over the last number of months, he’s really opened up to this space.” ReserveOne says it will not only hold crypto but also put it to work. The company plans to lend out assets and stake them to earn regular payouts. This institutional staking model is already common in crypto, but ReserveOne thinks doing it as a public company makes it more credible to larger investors. Backing this entire deal are two well-known crypto companies, Kraken and Blockchain.com, who are putting in up to $750 million in combined equity and convertible debt. The blank-check structure gives ReserveOne a shortcut to the public markets, skipping the longer traditional IPO route. Blank-check firms like M3-Brigade are shell companies that raise funds first and then look for a private firm to merge with. Once the deal is complete, the private company becomes publicly listed. That’s how ReserveOne is landing on the Nasdaq.

But at the same time when old names are in trouble, an emergent force is winning all the attention. The token that is bucking the trend is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which rocketed towards the parabola in July and has piqued the interest of analysts and retail traders. Mutuum Finance is at presale stage 5 at $0.03. The stage is already more than 60% sold. With more than $11.9 million already raised and more than 12800 investors, Mutuum Finance is gaining momentum. As old coins such as DOGE feel the pressure of changing moods and overall crypto news today, everyone is turning towards this blisteringly-swelling Mutuum Finance as it rises in the ranks. Dogecoin Faces Bearish Pressure Near $0.16 as Investors Shift Focus Dogecoin (DOGE) is under pressure of a resurgent bearish mood as its trading volume weakens and large holders seemingly unwind their positions. Having tested a level of support just above $0.16 briefly, DOGE is still at a crossroad, as traders are not sure whether it can revive a bullish momentum or move lower. Even though the meme coin continues to enjoy high brand awareness and community support, the recent price movement indicates that the entire market is wary of risk-asset-based tokens. With Dogecoin unable to regain its upwards pace, many investors are now considering minor projects with more massive growth prospects – such as Mutuum Finance, which is not losing any traction in its presale. Mutuum Finance Presale Hits $11.9 Million Mark Fast Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale has reached more than 12,800 investors in a presale of more than $11.9 million. Hype for the project is off the charts and this is clearly a great sign of the project’s future. MUTM tokens cost $0.03 in phase 5 but will rise 16.67% in phase 6. This phase is over 60% sold out as investors scramble to jump in at the lowest price. The need is becoming exponentially high and the fact that Mutuum Finance is a disruptor in DeFi is even more valuable considering the fact that it will be among the popular crypto investments of 2025. MUTM Giveaway Offers $100,000 in Rewards Mutuum Finance is set to reward the early supporters it has on its platform and has established a $100,000 giveaway , where 10 participants will be chosen and rewarded with $10,000 MUTM tokens. It will be a reward to the quickly expanding community inside the project and gratitude for early investors. But time’s running out. Mutuum Finance Prioritizes Security with New $50K Bounty Mutuum Finance has launched its Bug Bounty Program with the support and cooperation of CertiK, and a maximum 50,000 USDT rewards pool will be provided. Reward falls in four categories namely; Major, critical, minor, and low to ensure that each level of exposure will be rewarded. This is another measure that demonstrates that Mutuum is a project with a proactive safety stance and its commitment to the development of the atmosphere favoring the finances that can be trusted. Dogecoin (DOGE) is under the pressure of bears and is unable to break above $0.16, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is trending against the current and thriving on investors pressure. Having raised over $11.9 million and involving more than 12,800 investors, Mutuum is becoming one of the stand-out DeFi projects in July. The MUTM tokens will be sold at 0.03 and the price is expected to increase by 16.67% in Stage 6 which gives the initial buyers a clear edge in terms of price. It has a $100K giveaway, a $50K CertiK-guaranteed bug bounty, and an effective DeFi structure, which makes Mutuum a strong candidate in the running to become the best crypto investment in 2025. Buy your allocation before the next price jump-up.

47846048,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=785060,1752024636,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/47846048.jpeg,ERC-20 Stablecoin Supply Hits All-Time High At $121B – Liquidity On The Rise,https://www.newsbtc.com/stablecoin/erc-20-stablecoin-supply-hits-all-time-high-at-121b-liquidity-on-the-rise/,"While Bitcoin struggles to break above its all-time high and altcoins face difficulty finding solid support, one corner of the crypto market continues to expand: stablecoins. Since the beginning of the bull run, the stablecoin market has shown consistent growth, cementing its reputation as one of crypto’s most reliable and scalable use cases. Unlike volatile assets, stablecoins offer stability, liquidity, and utility across DeFi, trading, and settlement. Related Reading: Ethereum Range Tightens – Liquidity Looms At $2,800 And $2,350 Top analyst Darkfost recently shared fresh data and highlighted a key development many have overlooked — the total supply of ERC-20 stablecoins is rising again. As of today, it has reached a new all-time high of $121 billion. This milestone signals renewed demand and liquidity entering the crypto ecosystem, at a time when other sectors appear stagnant. The rise in stablecoin supply underscores the sector’s resilience and importance. While speculative tokens face resistance, stablecoins thrive on utility and adoption. Whether for hedging, yield strategies, or capital movement, their role in crypto remains foundational. As the broader market waits for its next move, the silent growth in stablecoin supply could be an early signal of renewed momentum across the board. The stablecoin narrative is far from over — in fact, it may just be starting. Stablecoin Growth Accelerates: On-Chain Data Points To Renewed Liquidity Stablecoins have emerged as one of the most impactful innovations in crypto, creating a vital bridge between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). This narrative gained massive traction in June when Circle (NASDAQ: CRCL), the company behind USDC, went public on the New York Stock Exchange. Initially priced at $31 per share, Circle’s IPO exceeded all expectations — closing the day at $82.84, marking a 167% gain. Today, CRCL trades nearly six times above its IPO price, giving the company a $42 billion market cap and reinforcing confidence in the stablecoin business model. On-chain insights shared by Darkfost add another layer to the story. According to the data, the total supply of ERC-20 stablecoins has started rising again and just hit a new all-time high of $121 billion. ERC-20 stablecoins are cryptocurrencies built on the Ethereum blockchain that follow the ERC-20 token standard. They are designed to maintain a stable value, usually pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar (e.g., USDC, USDT, DAI). This surge in supply is critical because stablecoins are minted on demand — their issuance directly reflects user demand and fresh liquidity entering the system. This expanding supply meets the needs of protocols and exchanges that face rising user activity and capital inflows. While market sentiment remains cautious, if the stablecoin supply continues to grow, it would signal renewed risk appetite and capital deployment. In that case, stablecoins may once again serve as the early catalyst for the next major phase in the crypto bull cycle. Related Reading: Altcoins Set A Higher Low – Bulls Target 2024 High To Trigger Altseason Dominance Hovers Below 8%: A Neutral Yet Strategic Positioning The weekly chart shows stablecoin dominance currently sitting at 7.90%, a level that reflects cautious but sustained interest in liquidity reserves across the crypto market. After a sharp climb between 2020 and mid-2022—when stablecoin dominance peaked above 16% during risk-off periods—dominance has gradually declined, aligning with risk-on rotations into Bitcoin and altcoins during bull runs. However, since early 2024, dominance has consolidated between 7% and 10%, signaling a more balanced environment. The current level remains just above the 50-week and 100-week moving averages (7.76% and 8.02%, respectively), suggesting strong horizontal support. Meanwhile, the 200-week moving average at 9.30% acts as a long-term ceiling. Related Reading: Ethereum Risks Downside If Resistance Holds: $2,700 Level Is Critical This neutral position implies that market participants are neither fully risk-on nor risk-off. If dominance rises from here, it could either reflect increased fear (capital flowing out of volatile assets) or fresh liquidity entering the market, especially if paired with a rise in stablecoin supply, which we’re already witnessing with ERC-20 tokens.

While ETH and SOL have long dominated as go-to picks for smart contract ecosystems, a growing wave of traders is rotating capital into an explosive new opportunity: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Early participants believe this high-energy presale could become the best altcoin buy right now , with the potential to mirror — or even surpass — the early days of Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE. Why Are Ethereum and Solana Holders Flocking to MAGACOIN FINANCE? Crypto markets thrive on narratives, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is crafting one that’s impossible to ignore. Positioned as a political meme coin with serious tokenomics , it taps into viral U.S. political culture in a way that resonates deeply with meme traders, retail enthusiasts, and even seasoned altcoin whales. Unlike countless low-effort meme tokens that rely purely on hype, MAGACOIN FINANCE has laid down solid foundations that are attracting thousands of Ethereum and Solana investors seeking higher ROI plays. Its capped supply of 170 billion tokens , zero-tax trading , and strict anti-inflation mechanics are designed to favor community growth and price momentum — a sharp contrast to many bloated meme tokens that dilute value over time. The Power of FOMO: Sold-Out Rounds and Limited Spots Left Perhaps the biggest reason MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing such attention is the undeniable sense of urgency and scarcity surrounding its presale. Earlier stages sold out in record time, locking in thousands of early investors and pushing demand for remaining allocations through the roof. With each presale stage fully subscribed, Ethereum and Solana wallets have begun piling in, eager to secure allocations before the next price bump. It’s the classic crypto snowball effect: the more early rounds fill, the stronger the community hype becomes , attracting fresh waves of buyers who don’t want to miss the next 50x, 75x, or even 100x opportunity. Ranked a Top Meme Coin and Best Altcoin Presale for 2025 Analysts and crypto influencers have already dubbed MAGACOIN FINANCE a top meme coin to watch , comparing it favorably to the explosive early growth seen by Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. But beyond the memes, many also see it as one of the best altcoin picks overall , citing its zero-tax ecosystem, transparent no-VC structure, and audited smart contract — features rarely combined in meme or microcap projects. Community momentum is equally impressive. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s social channels have surged past 20,000 active members , with thousands of wallets tracking the presale. Telegram and Twitter communities are buzzing daily with discussions, memes, and user-generated content, fueling a viral loop that’s been key to breakout stories in the past. Still Early — But Moving Fast The most compelling argument for Ethereum and Solana holders to rotate into MAGACOIN FINANCE might be that it’s still early . While the presale has already locked in significant demand, many analysts believe this is just the start. Unlike mainstream altcoins that have already priced in much of their growth, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE offer a rare asymmetric opportunity: a small initial investment can translate into massive upside if the project achieves even a fraction of the community traction or listings that older giants enjoy. Given how quickly previous meme favorites like DOGE, SHIB, and PEPE delivered life-changing gains for early believers, it’s no wonder traders are now calling MAGACOIN FINANCE their top speculative bet of the year . Is MAGACOIN FINANCE Really the Best Crypto Presale Right Now? Many seasoned altcoin traders think so. With multiple sold-out stages , a unique meme narrative that captures global attention, rock-solid tokenomics (including an independent audit), and thousands of Ethereum and Solana investors rotating into the presale, MAGACOIN FINANCE is shaping up to be one of the most exciting crypto stories of the cycle. Whether it ultimately joins the ranks of early Dogecoin or Shiba Inu remains to be seen. But for those on the hunt for the next 100x moonshot , the signals are hard to ignore: limited spots left, rising hype, and an eager community all pushing in the same direction. That’s a recipe that has launched countless altcoins into the stratosphere — and MAGACOIN FINANCE appears to be checking every box. Final Thoughts If you’re looking for the best crypto presale to watch right now , MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out not just because of its meme appeal, but because of how methodically it’s structured for growth. As Ethereum and Solana whales diversify into high-upside plays, this project is quickly climbing to the top of watchlists across the crypto world. As always, it’s smart to do your own research. But with limited presale allocations remaining, thousands already locked in, and analysts calling it a potential breakout meme coin of the year , FOMO might just have good reason to kick in.

47846157,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=762527,1752024668,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/47846157.jpeg,Hype fades as NFT platforms lose users,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/nft-market-slumps-for-fifth-straight-quarter/,"The NFT market has reached its lowest point in a year and a half, suggesting a long winter in digital collectibles ahead. Their sales volume fell to $823 million in the second quarter of 2025, down from $4 billion over the same period in 2024, according to a new report by DappRadar. That’s a 19% drop from the first quarter of this year and the fifth consecutive quarterly decline. This ongoing bust paints a bleak picture for digital collectible investors and creators. So far, 2025 is the worst year in NFT history, with no real recovery prospects. Nearly every part of the industry is reeling from the steep drop, from well-established collections such as Bored Ape Yacht Club to newer and smaller projects vying to prove their worth and utility. There are several reasons behind the decline, experts say. Interest has waned among the retail traders who, in recent months, flocked to digital collectibles in search of a quick buck. High gas fees on Ethereum, dwindling media buzz, and increasing skepticism about the long-term value of NFTs haven’t helped, either. In other words, fewer people buy, sell, or talk about digital collectibles. Hype fades as NFT platforms lose users NFTs came crashing into the mainstream in 2021 and 2022. They made millionaires overnight from artists and spawned a new generation of digital collectors. Landmark sales, most notably the Beeple auction at Christie’s , which took in $69 million, made headlines around the globe. In this golden age, trading volume in digital collectibles soared past $50 billion a year, and some crude cartoon images changed hands for more than $500,000 apiece. But the gold rush didn’t go on forever. But just as rapidly as NFTs ascended, they began to tumble. Prices began to tumble in mid-2022, erasing billions in value. Collections that once commanded high-profile attention now sell for a fraction of their peak prices. Numerous investors are now left clutching essentially worthless assets. The decline in traffic and trading activity has impacted even major NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, once the dominant platform for collectors. Others, including LooksRare and Blur, are dangling heavy incentives to keep users to little avail. Not even bands and celebrities that were once most aggressively promoting digital collectibles — from basketball players to internet stars — are making much noise. Many projects launched during the hype period are either dead or claimed to be scams. With buyer sentiment down, the mood around digital collectibles has turned to cautious optimism and even skepticism. Trump launches NFTs but fails to revive market And one of the last high-profile figures still pushing digital collectibles is the US president, Donald Trump. Since taking the political stage again, he has released four NFT collections, all dedicated to bold and sometimes humorous interpretations of himself, images of himself in superhero outfits, clutching gold bars, or even appearing to hug the cryptocurrency Bitcoin symbolically. Each of his prior releases has sold out within hours. Trump also held a special NFT holders ’ dinner in 2023 that attracted a lot of media coverage. The NFT drops have become part of his fundraising strategy, a mishmash of politics, pop culture, and crypto. But even Trump’s celebrity draw hasn’t reversed the broader tide. The Bitwise Blue-Chip NFT Collections Index, which measures the performance of top NFT art and collectible projects, has dropped 52% since January 2024, when Trump’s re-election campaign started to heat up. This tells us that though stock drops from new infections may cause an initial blip of interest, they don’t seem to move markets back sustainably. Meanwhile, other segments of the crypto space are proving more resilient. Meanwhile, Bitcoin and Ethereum rebounded in price in 2024 thanks to institutional investment and optimism around exchange-traded funds (ETFs). But NFTs have not benefited from that bounce.

Announced on Tuesday, the investment will fund the creation of the National Academy for AI Instruction (NAAI), a program designed to train 400,000 K–12 teachers over the next five years. The initiative will offer free in-person workshops, hands-on seminars, and virtual learning modules to help educators effectively integrate AI into their teaching practices. The training will cover using AI for tasks like lesson planning, grading, communication, and classroom management—enhancing, not replacing, the teacher’s role. The program is being launched in collaboration with the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), one of the largest teachers’ unions in the country, underscoring strong support from within the education sector. Microsoft is the lead investor in the project, signaling the tech giant’s growing focus on the education space. The initiative aims to empower teachers with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to use AI as a supportive tool, streamlining administrative work, boosting creativity, and freeing up more time for direct student engagement. Tech firms set up first AI training hub in NYC The first stationary training location will be in Manhattan, NY, opening in late summer or early fall. The school will eventually grow to other physical locations throughout the country. Alongside in-person instruction, the academy will feature distance-learning sessions to ensure that even teachers in rural or underserved areas can take advantage of the resources. A training program will introduce the technology and explain how it might be applied in real classroom settings, including the use of AI for tutoring, automating lesson plans, creating tailored assignments for students, and helping students who learn differently from the majority of their class. Sessions will also discuss AI ethics, bias, data privacy, and student safety — all of which are at the top of educators’ and parents’ minds. “When it comes to AI in schools, the question is whether it is being used to disrupt education for the benefit of students and teachers or at their expense,” Chris Lehane, chief global affairs officer of OpenAI, said in a statement. “We want this technology to be used by teachers for their benefit, by helping them to learn, to think and to create.” Tech companies accelerate AI education push The new academy arrives as demand for AI in education continues to grow across the United States. In April, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a White House Task Force on AI Education that called for public-private partnerships to encourage AI literacy in K–12 education. It has emerged as one of the biggest fruits of that order yet. Tech companies have been aggressively building up their presence in education. OpenAI has also worked with the California State University system to give AI tools to more than 500,000 students and faculty members. Anthropic, which developed the Claude AI assistant, released Claude for Education on Wednesday, a customized version of its chatbot for higher education users, almost two months after the company made its official product debut. Through its competitive Google for Education program, Google is still signing deals with public schools and universities to bring AI-powered tools for administration and learning. Such moves are happening as there is a dawning realization that AI literacy is as important as digital literacy has become, especially for the next generation of students and workers. However, the speed with which things have changed has also stirred concerns about fairness, access, and misuse. Dealing with that concern, the academy’s developers say they’re creating the program with teachers in every aspect. Responsible and inclusive use of AI in schools will be a blinkered target to ensure the technology positively impacts learning, not negatively.

Watching coins move up while you stay on the sidelines can be frustrating. This is why finding top crypto coins to buy today is important for those aiming for better growth. People want coins that actually give real returns instead of just hype. In this detailed guide, you will learn why Avalanche, AAVE, Aptos, and BlockDAG are among the top crypto coins to buy today and why they deserve your focus right now. Do not let today pass while others collect gains you could have grabbed. 1. BlockDAG: Early Access Brings Massive Potential Those searching for top crypto coins to buy today should check out BlockDAG (BDAG) , which is the biggest presale crypto in history! It is rapidly moving towards its GLOBAL LAUNCH release event on August 11, placing it ahead of many new projects. BlockDAG is a Layer 1 blockchain built using DAG tech, offering quick transactions, strong scalability, and smooth parallel processing. BDAG coins are currently priced at just $0.0016 until August 11th, allowing early users to join at the cheapest rate. With plans for a listing price of $0.05, many see a chance for over 30× growth, and some even expect BDAG could reach $1 post-launch. The project has already raised $333 million in presale funding, sold 23.7 billion coins, and is in presale batch 29. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. BlockDAG has cleared security audits by CertiK and Halborn and plans to list on 20 exchanges, including MEXC, BitMart, and LBANK. With these strong steps and ready-to-use tools, BlockDAG ranks among the top crypto coins to buy today. 2. Avalanche: Growth Through Custom Subnets Avalanche (AVAX) continues to gain strong support this month for enabling companies and government bodies to build their own blockchains. Its subnet model lets users build networks matching their needs, such as rules, fees, and privacy. Avalanche is expanding in the Middle East with digital projects and blockchain platforms. This practical use case makes AVAX one of the top crypto coins to buy today. Its sub-second finality ensures quick transactions, increasing trust and value locked. If AVAX remains above $18, experts believe it could rise toward $44 to $50 in the coming months. With its strong tech and more adoption, Avalanche remains solid. 3. Aave: Leading DeFi with New Options In DeFi, Aave (AAVE) continues to stand out thanks to new features that add user value. The Umbrella Protocol allows a form of decentralized insurance, where users stake tokens to cover risks and protect against bad debt, while DAO funds also support risk cover. It also added multi-asset functions and Binance perpetual contracts, raising strong market interest. With more than $25.5 billion in total value locked and $42 million in monthly fee earnings, Aave proves its use and trust. It remains one of the top crypto coins to buy today. Many say if AAVE breaks above $283, it could aim near $324. With ongoing upgrades, Aave remains strong in DeFi growth. 4. Aptos: Signs of Revival After a Rough Period Aptos (APT) has finally started to gain momentum following months of price drops. It uses the Move programming language and parallel processing, making it secure and good for developers. Fresh upgrades and community plans are drawing attention back to APT. Because of these positive updates, Aptos stands as one of the top crypto coins to buy today. Its price moved above $5.00 recently, ending the downtrend, and if support stays firm, it could reach between $5.55 and $6.00. This comeback could bring surprises for many traders this month. Key Takeaway! Looking at AVAX, AAVE, and APT shows they hold real promise. AVAX offers custom chains with speed, AAVE leads DeFi with fresh features, and APT is bouncing back strong. They stand as the top crypto coins to buy today with growth chances. But BlockDAG presents unmatched early entry power. Its upcoming GLOBAL LAUNCH Release, affordable price of $0.0016 till August 11th, and advanced DAG tech make it stand out from all.

Investors clearly aren’t flinching. They’ve heard it before. And this time, they’re not pulling money out of the system. According to CNBC , the MSCI All Country World Index, which tracks over 2,500 stocks worldwide, jumped nearly 10% since January and hit an all-time high on July 4. Greece, Poland, and the Czech Republic are leading the global pack with massive year-to-date gains. Greece is up nearly 60%, Poland jumped 56%, and the Czech Republic hit 52%, all beating out the US, which only managed about 7% during the same stretch. Europe gains while American stocks crawl Greece’s equity surge is backed by a mix of banking gains, economic recovery, and tourist dollars. Gabriel Sacks, who leads global emerging markets equities at Aberdeen, said Greece has been ahead in Eastern Europe for a while, thanks to its economy bouncing back, cleaned-up banks, and a strong tourism season. Investors also liked that the Greek government started paying back its bailout debt early and kept running fiscal surpluses. George Efstathopoulos, a multi-asset manager at Fidelity International, said Greek stocks should keep climbing because of how well Greek banks are doing. Poland and the Czech Republic followed close behind, with strong year-to-date performances. Among the ten top-performing markets globally, eight are in Europe. Alongside Greece, Poland, and the Czech Republic, other top performers include Spain, Italy, and Germany. Michael Field, the EMEA Chief Equity Market Strategist at Morningstar, said the “sell America” trend at the start of the year and improving economic numbers in Europe pulled cash into those markets. Michelle Gibley, Director of International Research at Schwab, said Germany’s break from austerity also helped fuel growth. Defense and bank stocks in Europe are performing well and facing less risk from US tariffs. Mark Mobius, who chairs the Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund, said those sectors are safer from Trump’s trade policies and still producing solid returns. Meanwhile, US stocks took a hit earlier in the year as investors fled Trump’s chaotic economic messaging. But by midyear, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq managed to recover and hit fresh highs. Still, their total growth this year is low compared to the booming European markets. Asia splits as Korea rises and Thailand crashes Asia’s performance is all over the place. South Korea has been one of the few bright spots, jumping over 30% year-to-date. That came despite Trump putting a 25% tariff on Korean exports and political drama back home. Daniel Yoo, a global strategist at Yuanta Securities, said the market already expected the tariffs and priced them in. He thinks there’s still a chance those tariffs get reduced if talks drag out until August 1, the deadline for the countries still negotiating with Trump’s White House. Manishi Raychaudhuri, the CEO at Emmer Capital Partners, said Korean exporters might survive Trump’s trade hits because US buyers would probably just eat the extra costs. Investors were also optimistic after Lee Jae-myung from the opposition party won a snap election in June, replacing Yoon Suk Yeol. Yoon had tried to declare martial law earlier in the year and got forced out. Morningstar’s senior analyst Kai Wang said sectors like shipbuilding and high-bandwidth AI chip manufacturing helped fuel Korea’s growth. China’s stock market climbed more than 17% this year, even while staying in Trump’s crosshairs. Steven Sun, head of research at HSBC Qianhai Securities, said investors expect the yuan to strengthen, earnings to improve, and policies to help. But he warned there’s no major stimulus planned, so pressure remains on China’s overall growth. Thailand is at the very bottom. Its market dropped more than 13% in 2025, dragged down by political messes, weak tourism, and US auto tariffs that hit Thai car part exports. Sacks said the country is still trying to crawl out of the Covid-era slump. Right above Thailand sits Turkey, where inflation, capital flight, and political repression continue to scare off investors. Sacks said any hopes for recovery disappeared when Istanbul’s mayor was arrested. Mobius added that the Turkish lira collapsing by almost 13% against the US dollar didn’t help either.

If you’re still reminiscing about the early Doge or Shiba days, this may be your second chance. The Memecoin Market Is Hot—Again Let’s be clear: SHIB and DOGE still dominate headlines. Their whale-driven moves, social buzz, and decades-in-the-making lore continue to drive speculative attention. But with volatility, mixed community sentiment, and evolving ecosystems, many investors are now scanning the horizon for the next viral hit. This is where MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the chat – not as a copycat, but as a cultural force of its own . MAGACOIN FINANCE: Not Just Another Meme MAGACOIN FINANCE is breaking through the crypto noise with a rare combination of meme energy, political flair, and smart, transparent design. From its inception, the project ditched the typical “get-rich-quick” token tactics and opted for zero tax , decentralized governance , and no venture capital influence – a direct appeal to the grassroots crypto crowd. This isn’t just about memes – it’s about movement. What really separates MAGACOIN FINANCE is its narrative-driven positioning . Inspired by bold, ideological themes, it’s galvanizing a highly engaged community who aren’t just buying in, they’re buying into something bigger. This is the type of organic story that meme coins thrive on. Selling Fast: Presale Frenzy The MAGACOIN FINANCE presale is already the stuff of legend. With multiple sold-out stages and limited spots remaining, the project is gaining traction at warp speed. Social channels like Telegram and Twitter/X are exploding with activity. Influencers are getting in. And early adopters are calling it the “ next Doge/Shiba ” before listings even hit. Presales rarely feel this kinetic unless the energy is real—and here, it is! Community Power & Exchange Speculation One of MAGACOIN FINANCE’s biggest weapons is its community. Every great meme coin rise, from DOGE to PEPE, was fueled by users who rallied behind an idea. In 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is that idea. Telegram admins are swamped, site traffic is booming, and the culture around the project feels electric. Adding more fuel to the fire? Growing rumors of imminent exchange listings . If true, this could catapult visibility and liquidity, locking in MAGACOIN FINANCE as a frontrunner for top altcoin of the year. A Cultural Bet in a Speculative Market In a market where utility isn’t always king, culture is currency – and MAGACOIN FINANCE understands this better than most. It’s a project that taps into collective identity, irony, rebellion, and financial upside – all wrapped in a meme-powered wrapper. This isn’t just another dog token. It’s a movement-meets-market coin, and in 2025, that’s what makes things go 100x. Final Take: Still Early, Still Climbing SHIBA and DOGE may be trending, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is transcending. With narrative momentum, a surging community, and a presale that’s already turning heads, it’s more than hype, it’s the top meme coin narrative in play right now. If you missed the early days of DOGE or SHIB, this might be your next shot. But act fast – spots are limited, momentum is building, and the window may close just as fast as it opened.

BTC is now recovering losses and might aim for a move above the $109,200 resistance. Bitcoin started a recovery wave above the $108,000 zone. The price is trading above $108,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $109,050 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it stays above the $107,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Eyes Upside Break Bitcoin price started a fresh decline after it failed near the $110,000 zone. BTC declined below the $108,500 and $108,000 levels before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $107,650 and the price started a recovery wave. There was a move above the $108,500 resistance zone. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $109,700 swing high to the $107,500 low. Bitcoin is now trading above $108,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . The first key resistance is near the $109,050 level. Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $109,050 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The next resistance could be $109,200 or the 76.4% Fib level of the downward move from the $109,700 swing high to the $107,500 low. A close above the $109,200 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $110,000 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $112,000 level. The main target could be $115,000. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $109,200 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support is near the $108,400 level. The first major support is near the $108,200 level. The next support is now near the $107,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $105,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $103,500, below which BTC might continue to move down. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $108,500, followed by $107,500.

The unprecedented demand has sent a jolt of uncertainty through financial markets, including the already volatile crypto sector. Trump criticized Powell accusing him for deliberately delaying interest rate cuts and acting favorably toward the previous administration.

The USDT issuer directly owns the vast majority of about 80 tons of gold stockpile outright. However, precious metals represent only 5% of Tether’s $112 billion reserve portfolio, per the company’s March attestation. “We have our own vault. I believe it’s the most secure vault in the world,” Ardoino noted, declining to reveal the whereabouts of the Swiss vault due to security concerns. USDT stablecoin reached a market cap of $159 billion last month, claiming 62.43% of the entire $255 billion stablecoin ecosystem. The company’s gold reserves match the UBS Group’s total precious metals and commodities exposure, the report added. Tether Gold Reserves Signals Pivot From Pure Fiat Exposure In Ardoino’s books, gold’s safe-haven status helps buffer against fiat or regulatory turbulence. He said that the precious metal is a safer asset than any national currency. “Eventually, I think that if people start to get concerned about the potential increase of the debt of the US, they might look at alternatives,” he told Bloomberg. Further, the recent surge in gold prices is fueled by central bank buying and a return of investor interest in gold ETFs, according to a report from J.P. Morgan . “Every single central bank in the BRICS countries is buying gold,” Ardoino added. Gold Reserves Could Lower Custody Costs Tether has been widely known for its association with gold, launching a gold-based token, Tether Gold, that recently showed stable gains . According to Ardoino, the company’s decision to own its own gold vault is due to the high costs that precious metal vault operators charge. If Tether’s gold token were to grow to $100 billion in circulation, “it’s a lot of money to pay 50 basis points,” said Ardoino. “If you have your own vault, eventually with the size, it gets much cheaper to do custody.” @Tether_to has invested in blockchain analytics firm Crystal Intelligence to boost efforts against illicit stablecoin use. #CryptoSecurity #BlockchainCompliance https://t.co/f1Stp5c6fi — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 8, 2025 The post Tether Quietly Built $8B Gold Reserves in Swiss Vault to Reduce Custody Costs: Report appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Gold|Paolo Ardoino|Tether,EN,0,0,FIAT|USDT|XAUT|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-07-09 02:53:49

After consolidating within a tight range, the breakout suggests that momentum is shifting back in favor of the bulls, and potentially setting the stage for a rapid push toward higher resistance levels. Pullback Or Launchpad? What Bitcoin’s Next Move Could Look Like According to MaxFINEancial’s latest analysis on X, he highlighted that a large green double bottom is forming within an orange bull flag on the 1-hour chart, which is a bullish continuation setup. Related Reading: Bitcoin Heating Up? NVT Golden Cross Hints At Potential Local Top The local high was a test of the trigger line of the double bottom, which signaled intent from the bulls. BTC is retesting the upper edge of the bull flag, aligning with the 1-hour 200-day MA, a critical dynamic support level that often dictates short-term momentum. MaxFINEancial projects a small pink bullish pennant forming and setting up for a continuation move higher. However, a rare diamond top pattern could also be taking shape, a bearish reversal formation that, if validated, may trigger a sharp downside move. If BTC loses the 1-hour 200-day MA, he advises shifting focus to the 4-hour 200-day MA, which is the line of defense. The important bullish area targets are $113,700, $115,867, $117,030, and $122,143, while the bearish diamond top target is $103,079. Market analyst A_y has also highlighted that Bitcoin is consolidating below the $110,000 resistance on the 4-hour chart, with the structure forming a textbook ascending triangle. This setup is the rising higher lows against horizontal resistance that precedes a strong breakout. If BTC manages to break above $110,000, the move could accelerate toward the $112,000 to $114,000 range, marking a bullish trend. However, failure to breach this ceiling may lead to a pullback toward $104,000, where previous demand has stepped in. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is neutral, suggesting that there is room for momentum to build, while the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a bullish crossover, that is hinting at potential upward momentum, BTC is still trading below the EMA, which means bulls need to prove strength for a confirmed breakout. Bitcoin Stable At $108,000 — Market Cooling, Not Crashing In an update on X, Chad_TattoosMD also emphasized that Bitcoin is showing resilience and holding strong around the $108,000 level despite the recent dip. BTC is maintaining its structure and refusing to break lower, which is a sign of underlying buyer confidence. Related Reading: Bitcoin Traders Are Betting Against the Rally, Will It Backfire? The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at neutral 54, indicating no extreme momentum in either direction. Meanwhile, the Stochastic (RSI) has entered overbought territory and is now cooling off, hinting at a potential short-term pullback. However, nothing on the chart suggests a breakdown is imminent. Chad_TattoosMD also points to $106,000 as the key support, and $112,000 as the resistance, which remains in a tight zone on the chart.

Among the most talked-about opportunities for 2025 are three tokens that consistently dominate top presale lists: Solana, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE. While Solana and XRP offer proven infrastructure and institutional credibility, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that’s stealing the spotlight with a disruptive approach, grassroots momentum, and staggering upside potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Underdog with 100x Potential MAGACOIN FINANCE isn’t just another crypto project riding the hype wave; it’s a politically relevant, fully decentralized Layer-1 protocol designed to challenge the status quo. With a strong ideological foundation and an anti-VC stance, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting thousands of retail investors seeking fairness, transparency, and the chance to back a movement rather than just a token. The numbers speak for themselves. With a planned exchange listing price of $0.007, early buyers could be looking at a potential return of 3,400% — a figure that easily competes with the best gains of the last bull run. But MAGACOIN’s strength isn’t just in hype; it lies in fundamentals. The project has passed a smart contract audit by Hashex, features zero tax on buys and sells, and allocates a full 60% of its total supply to presale participants — a rare show of commitment to community ownership. Unlike many projects that depend heavily on venture capital or centralized influencers, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building from the bottom up. Its rapidly growing community on Telegram and X reflects a new generation of investors who value utility, decentralization, and ideological alignment. Whether you’re a seasoned trader or a newcomer looking for the next breakout altcoin, MAGACOIN offers a fundamentally sound entry point with real upside. Why Solana and XRP Still Make the List Solana continues to capture institutional attention with its high-speed infrastructure, low fees, and booming ecosystem. The blockchain has made headlines with the launch of staking-backed ETFs and real-world integrations from fintech giants, making it a solid pick for long-term value seekers. Its growing DeFi and NFT footprint also suggests staying power as one of the top Layer-1 platforms in the space. XRP, on the other hand, has evolved from a cross-border payments tool to a regulated crypto asset with expanding utility. With Ripple’s application for a U.S. banking charter and an upcoming stablecoin (RLUSD) in the pipeline, XRP is being repositioned as a compliant bridge currency for institutions. While not a presale token, XRP remains a must-watch for its potential to catalyze mass adoption of blockchain finance. Conclusion: MAGACOIN FINANCE Leads the Charge As the second half of 2025 unfolds, presales will remain one of the most powerful vehicles for wealth creation in crypto. However, not all tokens are built the same. Solana and XRP have earned their spots through years of development and adoption, but MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one project daring to rewrite the rules. With unmatched ROI potential, grassroots momentum, and a mission that resonates far beyond crypto, it’s more than a presale — it’s a movement. Investors looking for the next 100x token won’t want to overlook MAGACOIN FINANCE. It’s not just another altcoin — it’s the future of fair, community-led finance.

A strong double-bottom pattern has sparked new hope. Meanwhile, the LTC price outlook weakened after a large whale unloaded coins, putting pressure on near-term action. Both coins are now at key levels where the next move could shift the momentum fast. But the biggest attention this week is on BlockDAG (BDAG) . With $332 million already raised and 23.6 billion coins sold, BlockDAG’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release is now locked in at $0.0016 until August 11. It’s one of the most watched presale entries with big ROI potential in the current cycle. Its two security audits, one by CertiK and one by Halborn, and the major US sponsorship deal is adding fuel. This puts BlockDAG in the spotlight for those searching for the best altcoins of 2025. DOGE Price Prediction: Bounce Starts From Bullish Setup The DOGE price prediction is showing life again after a classic double-bottom appeared between $0.157 and $0.158. This setup, with strong volume, sparked a 2% bounce that brought DOGE back toward $0.16. If DOGE pushes through the $0.17 zone, it could break the current downtrend and confirm a reversal. For now, the DOGE price prediction depends on volume pushing past $0.17. Bitcoin’s recovery from $105,200 to $107,000 helped lift sentiment, but DOGE needs to climb above its lower high near $0.17 to really shift momentum. LTC Price Outlook: Big Sell-Off Brings Caution The LTC price outlook turned shaky after a whale sold off 340,000 LTC following a rally. Though Litecoin climbed 6% and now sits near $85, on-chain signs are pointing to more selling. Dormant wallets are active again and profit-taking is rising, which could signal more downside. Analysts are watching the Relative Strength Index, which is still under 50 and showing bearish signals. If LTC breaks above $91.61, it could run toward $96.30. But if it fails, the LTC price outlook could slide back to the $77 support zone. BlockDAG Gears Up for Launch and Big US Sponsorship Push BlockDAG isn’t just another presale on the map. It’s quickly making waves as one of the best altcoins of 2025. With $332 million already raised and 23.6 billion BDAG coins sold, the momentum keeps building. Now, talks of a major US-based sponsorship are heating up, with a deal expected to bring nationwide media reach and digital brand exposure. Most early-stage projects wait until listings for big visibility. BlockDAG is flipping that script by locking in attention before public trading begins. If the sponsorship deal moves forward, it could bring mainstream coverage across major platforms, adding fuel to the early buzz. Security is also a big part of the story. BlockDAG has completed audits from both CertiK and Halborn, two top firms in blockchain safety. This two-audit setup shows technical strength as the project heads into launch. The current price sits at just $0.0016, available until August 11’s GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With a confirmed launch price of $0.05, this entry opens the door to a possible 3,025% ROI. In comparison, Batch 29 was priced at $0.0276, giving a 2,660% return for early entries. That makes this moment the most rewarding point in BlockDAG’s record-setting presale so far. Where the Market Is Moving This Week The DOGE price prediction is beginning to show strength with signs of a bullish double-bottom pattern forming. On the other side, the LTC price outlook is facing pressure. Whale activity and soft technical indicators are weighing it down. Both DOGE and LTC are at key levels that could shift the short-term direction fast. BlockDAG, meanwhile, keeps picking up speed. With $332 million raised, 23.6 billion coins sold, and a locked price of $0.0016 through the GLOBAL LAUNCH release on August 11, it’s offering a chance at 3,025% ROI. Thanks to audits from both Halborn and CertiK, it’s no surprise BlockDAG is being talked about as one of the best altcoins of 2025 .

The sale is reportedly part of a plan made public earlier this year, which gives him the green light to dump up to 25 million Amazon shares through May 2026. This move follows an earlier sale in late June, where Jeff offloaded another $736.7 million in Amazon stock. He may be selling, but he’s nowhere near out. He still holds over 900 million shares, putting his Amazon stake around $200 billion. Jeff hasn’t run the company since 2021, but he’s still calling shots from the top as chairman and still holds more Amazon than anyone else alive. Jeff unloads stock after headline-making $50 million wedding Jeff’s latest cash-out came just days after his jaw-dropping $50 million wedding to Lauren Sanchez in Venice, Italy. The event pulled in an obnoxiously A-list crowd: Oprah, Bill Gates, Leonardo DiCaprio, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, and a few Kardashians, because of course. It’s unclear if the wedding had anything to do with the timing of the sale, but let’s not pretend a $50 million price tag doesn’t require serious liquidity. While all this personal drama plays out, the Amazon chart is telling a different story. According to FactSet, its 50-day moving average just crossed above the 200-day, forming what’s known in technical trading as a golden cross. It’s a signal a lot of chart readers treat as bullish. The numbers are close: the 50-day sits at $206.46, just barely topping the 200-day at $206.04. But in technical analysis, that little flip matters. The sale comes while Amazon’s summer Prime Day is heating up. What used to be a one-day event now runs for four straight days, ending Friday. Analysts are keeping an eye on this, not just for sales, but for macro trends. Brian White from Monness Crespi Hardt wrote Monday that this window could be a smart time for shoppers to buy before U.S. tariffs go up in the second half of 2025. He called the sale “an opportunity” for anyone trying to dodge inflation later this year. Prime Day sale pushes Amazon stock momentum Not everyone’s just watching the charts. The beauty category is expected to dominate Prime Day, according to Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group. She pointed out that beauty sales during Amazon events usually outperform. The U.S. beauty market as a whole is still growing, even if the pace is stabilizing. For Amazon, that means more transaction volume, which could feed into the momentum already building in the stock. Even after gaining more than 30% over the past three months, Amazon still trades around 8% below its intraday all-time high from early February. But with the golden cross now showing on the chart, there’s talk among technical analysts that the stock could push back up toward those highs if the current rally holds. The stock dump, the wedding, the Prime Day sales, and the golden cross? All happening in a span of weeks. The numbers are real, the filings are public, and the timing is loud. Jeff cashed out $665.8 million in July. He sold $736.7 million in June. He can still dump more through May 2026. And he’s got the SEC paperwork to keep doing it.

The U.S. president signaled plans to hike tariffs on imports, potentially as high as 50%, citing ongoing friction with the European Union over tech regulations. The rhetoric sent Asian equities lower for a third time in four sessions, pushed copper futures down in London, and dragged U.S. equity futures into the red. Yet Bitcoin remained largely unfazed, suggesting crypto investors are either discounting the macro noise or viewing BTC as increasingly insulated from global policy risk, some opined. “Bitcoin’s slight price drop from Trump's tariff plans showcases the digital asset's resilient nature and long-term investor confidence,” said Han Xu, Director at HashKey Capital, said in a Telegram message. “We’re optimistic this trend will continue even amid short-term volatility.” Still, there's clear hesitation at these levels. “Buyers are quickly letting off steam,” noted FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich. “BTC keeps getting pushed down near $110K, and while the 50-day moving average is attracting dip buyers, sellers are just as active.” He added that overall market capitalization, while still up 1.8% on the week, slipped 0.6% in the past 24 hours to $3.35 trillion, signaling another “bout of indecision” at the top. That choppiness persists even as crypto ETF inflows continue. CoinShares reported its 12th consecutive week of net inflows, with nearly $1 billion entering crypto funds last week, and over $790 million of that amount going into Bitcoin. Ether-tracked products brought in $226 million, Solana $22 million, and XRP $11 million. Total ETF assets under management have reached an all-time high of $188 billion. But under the hood, there are signs of fatigue. Bitcoin’s on-chain activity and implied volatility have dropped to their lowest in nearly two years, according to The Block. Glassnode called it a “summer lull,” pointing to collapsing trading volumes and a rising concentration of unrealized gains among long-term holders, or factors that could trigger a sharper move if sentiment turns. Despite the lack of momentum, markets remain firmly risk-on, just nervously so. “Capital continues to move away from the 200-day moving average,” Kuptsikevich added, “which shows the market still leans bullish. But any shift in tone could lead to quick profit-taking.”",Markets|Trading|Markets|News,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-09 03:43:26

While stalwarts like Ethereum and community-driven tokens like Shiba Inu continue to anchor many portfolios, one emerging project is commanding serious attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Here’s why this unique altcoin could be the standout play of the cycle — and how it stacks up against these other notable names. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Only Presale Grabbing Headlines as the Next Meme Giant Among all the altcoins on watchlists for 2025, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the one turning the most heads — and for good reason. While countless meme coins appear and fade, MAGACOIN is carving out a niche by blending meme culture with a powerful political narrative and genuine decentralized governance. No trading taxes: Unlike typical meme tokens that siphon value with each transaction, MAGACOIN’s zero-tax model means more of your capital stays invested — a huge advantage for long-term ROI. Audited and transparent: A Hashex audit and a fully public contract give MAGACOIN a layer of credibility most new meme coins lack. Presale demand is exploding: Thousands of investors have already jumped in, with previous stages closing faster than expected. Spots in the current round are filling rapidly, putting early movers in a position to capture the biggest gains. Top analysts are calling MAGACOIN one of the most promising meme-powered launches since the early days of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, with projections ranging from 25x to even 100x upside if momentum continues. For those who missed the earliest waves of DOGE or SHIB, this may be the closest thing to a true second chance — still early, still under the radar, but moving quickly. 2. Ethereum (ETH): The Proven Pillar for Institutional Investors Ethereum’s track record is unmatched in the crypto space. Its network underpins most DeFi, NFT, and enterprise blockchain projects. Recent developments, like the Dencun upgrade, continue to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs, ensuring Ethereum remains the backbone for decentralized applications. 3. Shiba Inu (SHIB): A Community Giant, But With Caveats Shiba Inu has evolved beyond its meme coin beginnings with the rollout of Shibarium, a layer-2 scaling solution designed to expand SHIB’s DeFi and metaverse use cases. The project benefits from a famously loyal community that has propelled its brand to global recognition. However, the high concentration of SHIB’s supply in a few wallets raises caution, and price moves often hinge on large holders. While it remains a favorite among retail traders chasing viral momentum, new investors might weigh this risk carefully. The Bottom Line: MAGACOIN FINANCE Offers the Most Compelling Upside Right Now For anyone scanning the crypto landscape for the best long-term ROI , it’s hard to ignore the unique position of MAGACOIN FINANCE. With no transaction taxes, a fully audited foundation, and thousands already backing it during its presale — all before it even hits major exchanges — MAGACOIN is shaping up to be the breakout story of this market cycle. Don’t wait to watch it 10x from the sidelines.

According to reporting from the Wall Street Journal, sales in Tesla’s second-largest market have dropped hard, down 30% year-over-year in May, while overall EV demand in China keeps rising. Just under 40,000 Teslas were sold last month, compared to over 57,000 during the same period a year ago. Meanwhile, companies like BYD and Xiaomi are growing fast. BYD now controls 29% of the EV and plug-in hybrid market. Tesla? Just 4%, compared to 11% in early 2021. Chinese officials once treated Elon like a national treasure. He got land, tax breaks, loans, and the rare right to build a factory without a local partner. But now, things have flipped. Tesla is falling behind the very competition it helped build. Cars from Chinese brands come loaded with features, multiple screens, in-car gaming, selfie cams, fridges, and stuff Tesla doesn’t offer. Local buyers say the brand is tired. Elon blocks feedback as Chinese team gets ignored Tesla’s team in China has tried for years to warn headquarters that local customers want new features, more smartphone integration, and native apps. In 2021, the China staff submitted a report explaining these demands. U.S. officials replied that entertainment and local integrations weren’t priorities. The same request came again in 2023 and 2024, with the same result. Tesla later added Mango TV but still offers fewer apps than domestic rivals. Meanwhile, sales staff are under pressure. A Tesla salesman in Beijing said his target jumped from four cars a week to one a day. Hours were stretched to 12 daily, up from 10. With models aging and local competition improving, workers say they’re left with less to pitch. And Tesla’s plan to build a car tailored to Chinese tastes? Scrapped. Elon changed direction, choosing instead to strip features and roll out a cheaper Model Y variant. That model starts at $36,700, while BYD’s Sealion 07 starts at $26,400. Elon’s relationship with Beijing is also deteriorating. In January, he met Vice President Han Zheng in Washington. Han reportedly told Elon that China hoped he’d help with U.S.-China relations. Elon didn’t bite. Now, officials say he’s no longer viewed as a useful bridge between the countries. At the same time, Tesla can’t roll out its Full Self-Driving (FSD) system in China. The software, live in the U.S. since early 2024, relies on AI trained from American driving data. That’s a no-go in China, where regulations require systems to be trained locally. Tesla offered to redact sensitive video, but the volume made officials uncomfortable. The company then proposed moving FSD training to China, but that plan also failed, Tesla can’t get the chips it needs due to U.S. export controls. Tesla loses tech race while rivals launch robotaxis While Elon was stuck in talks, Chinese firms charged ahead. XPeng’s XNGP and BYD’s Eyes of God launched with FSD-style capabilities. Baidu and Pony AI already operate robotaxi fleets. Tesla? Nothing. In February, the company tried sneaking in some FSD features with over-the-air updates, exploiting a gray area in regulations. Officials shut it down, clarified the rules, and blocked a free one-month trial Tesla later offered in March. Regulators said Tesla “shouldn’t use drivers as guinea pigs.” Elon’s problems don’t end with cars. In March, Tesla began shipping Megapack batteries to Australia from its new Shanghai factory. But battery giant CATL is already deep in that market. Tesla’s other gamble, humanoid robots, also depends on China. Its Optimus robot, built in the U.S., uses Chinese parts. Despite new U.S. tariffs, Tesla kept buying from its suppliers, who helped slash costs. Now, local startups like Unitree and Agibot are working with those same suppliers. “Once you secure contracts with Tesla, domestic robotics companies will be much more willing to collaborate with you,” said Chen Feng, a marketing manager at a Tesla supplier. That could put Elon right back in the same position he’s in with EVs, surrounded by competitors he accidentally helped build. During a call with analysts, Elon said, “I’m a little concerned that on the leaderboard, ranks two through 10 will be Chinese companies.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Tech|Tesla,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-09 04:02:52

The price is now showing positive signs and might climb above the $2.32 resistance. XRP price started a fresh increase above the $2.280 zone. The price is now trading above $2.280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it stays above the $2.250 zone. XRP Price Eyes Fresh Increase XRP price started a fresh increase after it settled above the $2.2620 level, beating Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.280 resistance level. The recent move was positive and the bulls pushed the price above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.353 swing high to the $2.251 low, and tested the $2.32 zone. Besides, there is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $2.280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading above $2.280 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $2.320 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.330 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $2.353 swing high to the $2.251 low. A clear move above the $2.330 resistance might send the price toward the $2.350 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.40 resistance or even $2.420 in the near term. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near the $2.50 zone. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.320 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.280 level and the trend line zone. The next major support is near the $2.250 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.250 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $2.220 support. The next major support sits near the $2.20 zone.

The proposed investment trust will primarily hold Bitcoin (BTC) , Ethereum (ETH) , Solana (SOL) , Ripple (XRP) , and Cronos (CRO) , the native token of the Cronos blockchain, which is associated with the Crypto.com exchange. The SEC has acknowledged the filing, which means it’s now under review, according to a July 8 SEC submission. Source: Sec.gov Truth Social ETF Portfolio Structure and Crypto.com partnership The ETF portfolio will maintain a composition of approximately 70% Bitcoin , 15% Ethereum , 8% Solana , 5% Cronos , and 2% XRP by value. Upon approval, the ETF will be listed and traded on NYSE Arca, though the fund’s ticker symbol remains undisclosed. ""the Trust’s allocation of its assets to the Portfolio Assets (the “allocation ratio”) is initially expected to approximate percentages by value of 70% bitcoin, 15% ether, 8% SOL, 5% CRO and 2% XRP."" — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) July 8, 2025 The proposed ETF is expected to function as a passive investment vehicle, tracking the market prices of its underlying cryptocurrencies without employing leverage, derivatives, or speculative trading strategies. The fund will also engage in staking for assets such as Ethereum, Solana, and Cronos, allowing it to generate staking rewards. Truth Social previously filed for a spot Bitcoin ETF in June, followed by a submission for a Bitcoin and Ethereum combination ETF. Similar to those registration statements, the “Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF” is sponsored by Yorkville America Digital, while Foris DAX Trust Company will be serving as custodian for digital assets, according to the filing. Additionally, Crypto.com will act as the ETF’s exclusive Bitcoin custodian, prime execution agent, and liquidity provider. Earlier reports indicated a TMTG partnership with Singapore-based Crypto.com to launch “Made-in-America” ETFs. The media platform signed a non-binding agreement to offer a series of exchange-traded products (ETPs) and funds (ETFs) on the Cronos blockchain-owned exchange. The inclusion of CRO in the investable ETFs appears to confirm Crypto.com’s involvement in the venture. Notably, the news of the recent filing had a notably greater impact on CRO than on other Truth Social blue-chip cryptocurrencies. The asset surged more than 20% to a monthly high of $0.09886, while Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana only experienced gains between 1.08% and 3.6% during the same period. Source: Coingecko TMTG’s Broader Digital Asset Strategy Amid President Trump’s Growing Crypto Fortune The SEC’s potential approval follows the confirmation by Truth Social’s parent company of its digital asset strategy, which includes a Bitcoin treasury plan. On May 30, the company announced it had raised $2.44 billion through a private placement involving nearly 50 institutional investors. The SEC has approved Trump Media and Technology Group’s (TMTG) registration statement linked to a $2.3 billion Bitcoin treasury initiative. #Trump #TruthSocial https://t.co/ybidUAZtqb — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) June 14, 2025 The funding round included 55.9 million shares at $25.72 and $1 billion in zero-coupon convertible notes, with proceeds designated for Bitcoin acquisition and general operations. In a May 27 announcement, TMTG President and CEO Devin Nunes described Bitcoin as “an apex instrument of financial freedom,” stating that it would become a core component of the company’s asset base. On the same day, Arkham Intelligence posted on X: “Donald Trump’s company, Trump Media, will buy $2.5 BILLION of Bitcoin. Is Trump about to go Saylor Mode?”, referencing MicroStrategy’s executive chairman and his aggressive Bitcoin strategy. Moreover, President Trump appears to be benefiting significantly from these cryptocurrency ventures. A July 2 Bloomberg report revealed that Trump and his family have reportedly earned over $620 million from recent cryptocurrency ventures, with Trump’s exclusive crypto holdings now comprising around 9% of his estimated $6 billion fortune as of June.

In his Tuesday post, Musk bashed the government for failing to take action against people on the Epstein client list , including a meme mocking the justice system. The meme insinuated that more squirrels and raccoons than Epstein’s affiliates have been apprehended. Crypto traders tied Musk’s post to Solana’s PNUT token Musk also mentioned a squirrel named Peanut, who was “arrested (and killed), in his post. While he didn’t name the PNUT token explicitly, the timing of his post coincided with a spike in the coin’s price and trading activity. Source: CoinMarketCap He wrote, “They arrested (and killed) Peanut but have not even tried to file charges against anyone on the Epstein client list. Government is deeply broken.” So far, the post has over 13.7 million views, earning nearly 45% of the views in just a few hours. Crypto investors seem to have associated his post with the Solana meme coin. After his post, the PNUT token surged 10% to $0.2357. The asset’s 24-hour trading volume also grew 80%, crossing $214 million. Currently, the meme coin has a market cap of $223 million, trading at $0.2257. Musk’s past posts have fueled crypto price rallies This is not the first time Musk’s posts have driven price rallies for crypto assets. In January, he changed his handle on X to “Kekius Maximus” and profile picture to show “Pepe the Frog” in Roman military attire, holding a video game joystick. After his alteration, the Kekius Maximus token surged over 900% . In 2021, Musk wrote, “The Dogefather SNL May 8” in one of his posts, and Dogecoin, a popular meme coin, rose over 20% in 24 hours. Then again, in 2024, he posted an AI image related to the token, causing another price rise for the token by about 8%. Additionally, in January 2021, he changed his bio on the platform to #bitcoin. Soon after, Bitcoin’s price jumped from roughly $32,000 to more than $38,000, adding $111 billion to its market cap. Moreover, the Ethereum-based meme coin Floki rose 418% after the billionaire posted a picture of his dog named Floki in 2023. Judging from history, Musk’s meme and crypto-related posts, no matter how subtle, tend to spark swift reactions in the crypto market. In this case, a satirical political reference propelled a Solana meme token upward, but whether the token can grow more hinges on future hype and traction. Musk is hoping to establish a new political party Meanwhile, the billionaire is focused on building a third party that could rival the Republican and Democratic parties. Following his fallout with President Trump over the ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ Musk disclosed the birth of the American Party. He’s touted the new party as tech-driven, fiscally responsible, energy-friendly, and politically centrist, aiming to attract both Democrats and Republicans alike. However, experts have warned that disbanding the grip of the traditional parties demands significant funding and long-term dedication. They noted how previous attempts failed, especially since elections in the country are at a state-by-state level. However, some are optimistic that Musk could pull through with his new party, including David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida. Jolly believes the challenge in forming a new party is having resources, noting that Musk could provide that. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

While the analysis noted that Bitcoin has formed a strong structure in recent weeks, it was claimed that a breakout in the short term could determine the direction. According to MakroVision’s technical analysis, Bitcoin price is currently approaching the red trend line that has been acting as a strong resistance for weeks. Above this level, there is a high amount of liquidity in the $111,000–$112,000 range. Related News: The Hidden Danger in the Cryptocurrency World: Could This be the Second Terra (LUNA) Incident? On the support side, two main areas stand out: The $106,400–$107,400 range is being watched as short-term support. The $105,000–$102,000 band below this level is defined as a larger demand zone. MakroVision states that if Bitcoin achieves a permanent break above the $110,000 level, a new upward momentum may begin. However, in case of a rejection from this level, the reaction of the price and whether the support zones can be maintained will be decisive in terms of the direction of the market. *This is not investment advice.

For the first time, anyone across the globe can hold US dollars via stablecoins, which will drive demand, in turn benefiting Ethereum. The Primary Settlement Layer Despite talk of “de-dollarization,” the global demand for US dollars is booming, especially via stablecoins , which now exceed $260 billion in total market capitalization. This is unlocking dollar access for billions, especially in emerging markets. More than four billion people and millions of businesses are actively seeking dollar access through stablecoins, the researchers noted. Stablecoins are spreading the dollar faster than any financial tech in history. And Ethereum is becoming the financial backbone. For Ethereum’s 10th birthday, we’re publishing our updated @ElectricCapital ETH thesis: Remaking the Case for ETH 1/ pic.twitter.com/Rr9mSrK0GS — mariaa.eth (@MariaShen) July 8, 2025 However, this burgeoning market of new dollar holders wants more than just digital cash. They need yields , investment opportunities, and financial services, and traditional finance, such as banks, cannot serve this massive new market due to regulatory, financial, geofencing, and infrastructure constraints. “Ethereum is uniquely positioned to host the global financial infrastructure for this new digital dollar economy, and ETH stands to benefit directly from this growth.” Ethereum is already primed for this position because it is globally accessible, institution-grade secure, and resistant to government interference. Additionally, Ethereum is already the primary settlement layer, underpinning the largest on-chain economy with more than $140 billion in stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets and $60 billion in DeFi. As a result, Ethereum will become to the on-chain dollar economy what Treasuries and gold are to traditional finance – a reserve and trust anchor. As stablecoin usage expands, a flywheel effect will be generated as more ETH is needed as collateral for DeFi and real-world finance, more ETH is staked, securing the network and reducing supply, and more institutional capital flows in , as the asset offers regulatory clarity and composability. No Real Competition There is no real competition at the moment because Bitcoin lacks programmability and adoption as a financial platform, and other blockchains lack Ethereum’s security, decentralization, and institutional credibility, they said. Additionally, traditional finance is geographically and regulatorily siloed and unable to serve the global demand unlocked by stablecoins. Anyone who has tried to open a bank account in a particular country without a physical address there would concur. “We’ve believed in programmable money since 2018. We made the institutional case for Bitcoin at our founding. Now we’re doing the same for Ethereum,” said Shen in conclusion.

The board has approved a phased investment of up to $100 million in Ethereum (ETH), marking a bold shift in its treasury strategy. To kick things off, the company priced a public offering of 8.42 million shares at $0.95, raising $8 million. The bulk of this funding will go toward launching the new ETH-based treasury vehicle. Following the news, the Ethereum price has climbed to $2,606.26, marking a 2.69% gain in the past 24 hours as market sentiment turns bullish. Wall Street moves deeper into crypto GameSquare Holdings ( $GAME ) just announced a $100M Ethereum treasury strategy, aiming to generate 8–14% yield on-chain. • Backed by a strategic alliance with Dialectic, one of the world’s top crypto investment firms • Capital will be… pic.twitter.com/EFI0PaSGFw — Swingly (@SwinglyHQ) July 8, 2025 Partnering with Dialectic for On-Chain Yield At the heart of the strategy is a partnership with Dialectic, a well-known crypto investment firm led by Ryan Zurrer. GameSquare will use Dialectic’s Medici platform, which applies machine learning and risk controls to target yields between 8% and 14%, well above the typical 3–4% ETH staking rate. This positions GameSquare to generate real, on-chain revenue rather than simply holding crypto. More Than Just ETH—A Diversified Approach The strategy won’t stop at Ethereum. GameSquare plans to explore other yield opportunities in the broader ETH ecosystem, including stablecoins and NFTs. This diversified model is designed to maximize returns while spreading risk. The board-approved $100 million will be deployed in stages, ensuring the company maintains enough capital for operations. CEO Justin Kenna said the new crypto strategy is part of a long-term plan to build financial resilience. Yield generated from Ethereum will support further ETH purchases, share buybacks, and core business reinvestment. This reflects a growing trend of traditional firms adopting digital assets not just for speculation, but for operational value. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : DeFi Dev Corp Acquires Additional 47.2k Solana: What Next for SOL Price? , Ethereum Market reaction GameSquare’s bold $100 million Ethereum treasury move is already stirring strong reactions across the crypto space. Investors are taking notice, especially after Bit Digital’s recent shift of its entire treasury to ETH caused its shares to surge nearly 20%, signaling growing confidence in Ethereum-based strategies. On X, analyst TylerD called out the GameSquare deal as a potential game-changer, pointing to the scale of investment as a rare corporate-level commitment to crypto. Many in the community see this as part of a broader trend, where institutions are gradually adopting Ethereum not just as a speculative asset but as a core financial tool. What It Means for Investors GameSquare’s move shows confidence in the future of decentralized finance. It’s also one of the more structured and institutional ETH plays we’ve seen from a media-tech firm. With strong partners and a phased plan, GameSquare is betting on Ethereum not just as an asset, but as an engine for growth. According to market data, GameSquare (GAME) rose by more than 58.76% yesterday, with a trading volume of $40.31 million. The current after-hours rise has exceeded the US stock market. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

On February 21, the global crypto exchange Bybit suffered a record-setting $1.4 billion hack, marking the largest single-theft event in crypto history. This attack, reportedly attributed to the Lazarus Group, highlighted persistent industry-wide vulnerabilities concerning advanced attack methodologies, systemic weaknesses, and inadequate cross-platform risk management frameworks. In response to these critical events, HTX reaffirmed its commitment to robust security by substantially increasing its investment. Through enhanced risk management protocols, strengthened operational security, and advanced intelligence capabilities, HTX has achieved comprehensive protection across accounts, trading, and assets. These proactive measures have successfully mitigated several high-risk threats, thereby safeguarding user assets and reinforcing trust within the HTX ecosystem. Crypto Industry Faces Evolving Security Challenges The crypto industry is experiencing a surge in the frequency and sophistication of threats, including hacks, scams, and malicious on-chain behaviors. The threat landscape has evolved from isolated phishing to multi-vector attacks, such as social engineering attacks, malicious contract deployment, UI spoofing, and deepfake deception. These tactics often exploit vulnerabilities between platform security systems. The first half of 2025 witnessed the Bybit hack and a string of protocol breaches on Solana, demonstrating a trend toward increasingly automated and professionally orchestrated attacks. At the same time, global regulators are tightening compliance expectations. Many jurisdictions have introduced regulatory frameworks for virtual asset service providers, mandating adherence with anti-money laundering regulations, enhanced account protection, and stringent risk management and auditing practices. This raises the bar for industry-wide security and compliance. On a positive note, core defense technologies such as on-chain traceability, AI-powered risk engines, and automated contract audits are becoming essential across major platforms, enhancing readiness and risk intelligence. HTX Mid-Year Security Highlights: Enhanced Protection & User Safeguards Over the past half-year, HTX’s security efforts have delivered meaningful results across multiple verticals: Account Security: Over 2.01 million security alerts were sent to users including 1.809M via email and 206k via SMS, greatly improving users’ security awareness. Additionally, 127 fake download pages and phishing domains were dismantled. Trading Security: 15 withdrawal attempts to scam addresses were blocked, which successfully recovered 104,847 USDT in potential user losses. Moreover, the platform handled 68 reports involving external stolen assets, leading to the freezing of 1,429,787 USDT in compromised funds. Asset Security: 20,871 malicious wallet addresses were added to HTX’s blacklist; 47 deposits from flagged addresses were intercepted. A total of 1,449,467 USDT assets were involved. In June alone HTX blocked 5 scam-related withdrawals, froze over $400,000 in compromised funds for other platform users, added 2,769 new blacklisted addresses with 21,239 USDT worth of fraudulent deposits prevented, and took down 41 new phishing domains. Security Infrastructure: New Systems. New Tech. New Paradigm. In 2025, HTX continued its transition toward a multi-layered security model, introducing critical upgrades across its three core protection pillars: Risk Management Architecture: HTX developed an in-house millisecond-level real-time risk engine that monitors every user interaction. Every high-risk behavior is dynamically filtered to mitigate account compromise, money laundering, and malicious activity. 24/7 Operational Security: HTX’s dedicated security operations and customer support teams operate on a round-the-clock cycle, enabling real-time response and full-cycle risk resolution. Threat Intelligence: HTX partners with top security firms, project teams, and other exchanges to maintain a real-time threat map. This collaboration accelerates cross-platform incident response, dark web surveillance, and hacker attribution. HTX’s comprehensive security system significantly reduces user vulnerability. Account security is enhanced through multi-factor authentication, behavioral biometrics, dynamic risk assessment, and collaboration with security agencies to eliminate phishing sites. Assets security leverages a million-level blacklist, partnerships with anti-money laundering organizations, on-chain tracking, and risk models to identify and prevent suspicious transactions. In terms of robust information security, the platform takes a string of measures, including a financial-grade security system and strict internal controls, to protect user data. Furthermore, HTX upgraded its PoR data storage to TiDB, improving system stability and efficiency, while reducing operational and maintenance costs. This contributed to substantial growth in overall user assets and a steady increase in core reserves during the first half of 2025, with continuous net growth in cryptocurrencies like USDT and ETH, demonstrating growing user trust. Building a Trust-Centric, Resilient Crypto Ecosystem Looking ahead, HTX is committed to accelerating its security infrastructure investment. This commitment not only protects users but also aims to shape the future of a safer, more resilient crypto industry. As one HTX security expert put it, “From the glaringly apparent challenges to cryptocurrency security in 2024 to the $1.44 billion Bybit exploit this year, we can tell that attacks have evolved from code exploits to targeting human weaknesses. Therefore, we’ve enhanced the integration of behavioral analytics and zero-trust architecture and brought three key upgrades to life: dynamic permission validation, end-to-end transaction authentication, and continuous red-blue team threat simulation. These aren’t just upgrades but are foundational steps toward long-term user protection and ecosystem synergy.” l Dynamic Permission Verification: At HTX, every fund operation now requires dual authentication, combining environment tagging with biometric validation. This ensures actions align with both the user and their operating environment. l End-to-End Transaction Authentication: By validating transaction payloads at the smart contract level, HTX eliminates risks from compromised UIs, closing the gap on deceptive front-end manipulation. l Always-On Red-Blue Simulation: Monthly, HTX’s security team simulates real-world attacks from top APT groups and hackers, constantly stress-testing the platform’s defenses and closing the loop between offense and response. HTX firmly believes that only a deeply integrated, multi-dimensional security architecture — coupled with a transparent, collaborative approach — can serve as the foundation for long-term user trust. As the threat landscape grows more complex, HTX will continue investing heavily in security innovation and infrastructure. Its mission is to not only defend against emerging threats, but to lead the crypto industry into a future that’s safer, smarter, and more sustainable for millions worldwide. About HTX Founded in 2013, HTX has evolved from a virtual asset exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, research, investments, incubation, and other businesses. As a world-leading gateway to Web3, HTX harbors global capabilities that enable it to provide users with safe and reliable services.

On the weekly chart, the asset is coiling tightly near a defined demand zone between $1.61 and $1.98, while pressing against a descending trendline that has contained price since early 2025. This setup signals a potential breakout just as the U.S. Federal Reserve prepares to upgrade its FedWire Funds Service to the ISO 20022 standard on July 14, 2025. This timing has not gone unnoticed by analysts. X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull), a crypto commentator on X, highlighted that the digital asset’s structure is “aligning with history in real time.” The chart he shared shows XRP nearing the apex of its multi-month consolidation, stating that “he rails are syncing with the narrative” as ISO 20022 goes live. As technical pressure builds, one of the most important infrastructure changes in U.S. finance is set to take effect, and XRP could experience the breakout to a new all-time high that analysts have been anticipating. $XRP chart is aligning with history in real time Price coiling at demand while ISO 20022 goes live? That’s not a coincidence, that’s the rails syncing with the narrative. Next move could melt faces. You positioned? pic.twitter.com/IK6QdqgyTh — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) July 7, 2025 FedWire’s ISO 20022 Transition and Its Implications The Federal Reserve has confirmed that on July 14, 2025, all payments through the FedWire Funds Service will switch to the ISO 20022 format . This marks the end of the current FAIM-based messaging system and the beginning of a new phase of structured, data-rich financial communication within the U.S. high-value payment system. FedWire’s adoption marks a significant milestone in the broader integration of ISO 20022 in global finance. It also strengthens the case for ISO-compliant systems , and XRP could potentially gain further relevance in institutional payment flows because of Ripple’s alignment with ISO 20022 standards. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Tightening Price Structure Suggests Impending Breakout XRP’s current price, around $2.28, is compressed within a descending triangle pattern that began after its rally in late 2024. Despite multiple tests of the support and resistance boundaries, the price remains tightly bound. This is often a precursor to increased volatility, especially when broader infrastructure or policy changes are on the horizon. X Finance Bull highlighted $11.33 and $14.48 as potential targets on the chart. However, other experts have predicted that the FedWire transition could send XRP to $25 . These targets may come into play only if XRP decisively breaks out from its current structure with strong volume and confirmation. For now, the focus remains on whether price can close above the trendline as the July FedWire milestone approaches.

Pi Network risks falling below $0.40 if stagnation continues. However, if the Pi Core Team implements just two of these 11 strategic actions, the community could regain confidence, and the price may recover steadily. Key suggestions include launching DAO governance, burning unclaimed tokens, forming partnerships with firms like OpenAI or Binance Cloud, and enabling cross-chain compatibility with Ethereum or BNB. Other actions like mass KYC rollout, introducing DeFi features, reviving node rewards, and funding developers through a Pi Launchpad could significantly boost utility and demand. July 9, 2025 05:26:21 UTC Pi Network Leads the Way With $16 Trillion AI Revolution AI is set to add $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and Pi Network is at the forefront in crypto. As the first major blockchain integrating AI, Pi’s App Studio lets users build AI-powered dApps without coding. From smart assistants to AI-driven tools, Pi is creating real-world utility. If Pi captures just 1% of the AI boom, that’s a $160B opportunity. More than crypto, Pi empowers people to own and benefit from AI innovation. The future isn’t coming, Pi is building it, block by block. July 7, 2025 12:21:59 UTC Pi Network Unlock Schedule Alert Between June 28 and July 15, 2025, the Pi Network saw the unlocking of over 250 million $PI tokens, valued at more than $135 million. These massive daily releases are creating significant sell pressure in the market. As more tokens flood into circulation, volatility is expected to rise. Pioneers should stay alert and closely monitor price movements. July 7, 2025 12:21:59 UTC Is Pi Network at Risk of a Decline? Pi Network is hovering around $0.477, but storm clouds may be forming. With over 300 million tokens set to unlock next month, sell pressure could spike. If Pi fails to hold the $0.477 level, it risks dropping back to its previous bottom near $0.40. Investors should watch this key support zone closely. July 7, 2025 12:19:36 UTC Pi Network Price in India The current Pi Network (PI) price on July 7, 2025, is around ₹39.82–₹41.07 per coin. The 24-hour trading volume is approximately $80–92 million, showing strong interest and liquidity. PI’s market cap stands near $3.5 billion. The coin saw a 4% price rise today, but remains volatile. July 7, 2025 12:08:21 UTC Pi Ecosystem Expands Rapidly with Over 10,000 Apps The Pi Network ecosystem is witnessing rapid growth, with the number of applications reaching 10,580 as of July 7. This surge highlights increasing developer interest and user adoption. Meanwhile, global banks and financial institutions are accelerating their integration into the Pi ecosystem. With its expanding Web3 infrastructure, Pi is steadily positioning itself as a global decentralized network. July 7, 2025 12:08:21 UTC Pi Network Price Faces Critical Phase Pi Network may be entering its most dangerous phase yet. Despite bullish news like AI partnerships and new apps, $Pi’s price remains stagnant. A massive 276 million token unlock this July could trigger $127M in sell pressure. The core team’s silence, stalled KYC, and falling on-chain activity are alarming. With top influencers quiet and community engagement dropping, trust is fading fast. While Bitcoin and Ethereum soar, Pi continues to lag. These aren’t just slowdowns they may signal a deeper crisis. Pioneers should prepare wisely and not rely on blind faith as pressure builds. July 7, 2025 12:08:21 UTC Pi Network Event in India The Pi Network GCV $314,159 event is happening on July 27, 2025, in Tinsukia, Assam, hosted by the PI GCV Warriors of Assam.

Michael Shannon Sims, a founder and promoter of OmegaPro, and Juan Carlos Reynoso, who led OmegaPro’s operations in Latin America and some parts of the U.S., were charged on conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering, according to documents published on Tuesday. OmegaPro was an international investment scheme, which collapsed in 2022. In 2024, Andreas Szakacs, the co-founder of the scheme, was arrested in Turkey in his involvement with OmegaPro. “As alleged, the defendants preyed upon vulnerable individuals in the U.S. and abroad, defrauding them of over $650 million by making false promises of substantial returns and that their money was safe,” said Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the justice department’s criminal division. OmegaPro was established in early 2019, by Sims and others. According to the document, the defendants and others promised investors 300% return over 16 months through foreign exchange trading. Investors were instructed to purchase these investment packages using crypto.

Remixpoint already holds an impressive digital asset portfolio, including over 1,051 BTC. Meanwhile, Japanese firm Metaplanet intensified its Bitcoin accumulation, and now holds 15,555 BTC with plans to reach 1% of all Bitcoin in existence by 2027. CEO Simon Gerovich envisions using BTC as collateral to fund acquisitions like a digital bank. At the same time, VC firm Ego Death Capital raised $100 million to back Bitcoin-only startups. Takashi Tashiro Accepts Bitcoin Salary Takashi Tashiro, the newly appointed CEO of Tokyo-based energy firm Remixpoint, will receive his salary in Bitcoin, according to a company statement that was released on Tuesday. The company explained that the move aligns with its goal of “shareholder-oriented management” and reflects Tashiro’s commitment to being “in the same boat” as shareholders. Remixpoint said the payment will be calculated in Japanese yen, and once taxes and remuneration are finalized, the equivalent amount in Bitcoin will be purchased and sent to a crypto wallet designated by Tashiro. Statement from Remixpoint Tashiro stepped into the CEO role in June, and stated that Bitcoin will be central to the company’s financial strategy as it pivots toward a treasury management focus. Even before his appointment, Remixpoint was accumulating a large digital asset portfolio. As of June 13, the company held more than 1,051 BTC, 901 ETH, 13,920 SOL, over 1.19 million XRP, and nearly 2.8 million DOGE, with a total market value exceeding $116 million. Takashi Tashiro In addition to leading Remixpoint, Tashiro is also affiliated with BITPoint, a crypto exchange tied to the SBI Group. The exchange recently attracted some attention for promoting the Trump-themed meme coin “Official Trump.” Remixpoint is not the first company to compensate its executives in cryptocurrency. In 2021, Argo Blockchain’s then-CEO Peter Wall opted to receive his salary in Bitcoin after being inspired by NFL player Russell Okung, who converted a portion of his income to crypto in 2020. Similarly, New York City Mayor Eric Adams accepted his first three paychecks in Bitcoin after his 2021 election campaign. Adams frequently boasted about the growth of his crypto holdings, especially since Bitcoin’s price has more than doubled since he first decided to embrace it. Metaplanet Plans Bitcoin-Backed Expansion Another Japanese firm is also grabbing the attention of the crypto space. Metaplanet is continuing its bold strategy of accumulating Bitcoin with the intention of using it as a financial asset to acquire revenue-generating businesses, including the potential purchase of a digital bank in Japan. In an interview with the Financial Times, CEO Simon Gerovich revealed that the company’s long-term vision is to transform its Bitcoin reserves into leverage for future expansion. He described the firm’s strategy as a “Bitcoin gold rush,” due to the urgency to accumulate as much BTC as possible before others can catch up. Gerovich is very confident that once Metaplanet reaches a critical mass of Bitcoin holdings, it will become increasingly difficult for competitors to rival its position. Metaplanet began buying Bitcoin in 2024 as a hedge against inflation. Since then, it has dramatically shifted its business model and now holds 15,555 BTC. The company plans to increase this number to over 210,000 BTC by 2027, which would amount to 1% of all Bitcoin that will ever exist. Gerovich said that once Metaplanet reaches sufficient holdings, it will begin using Bitcoin as collateral to access financing. He even compared it to how companies use traditional securities or government bonds. The plan is to convert this financial flexibility into acquisitions of cash-generating assets, with a strong preference for businesses aligned with its digital-first vision. One of the main targets under consideration is a digital bank in Japan, which would allow Metaplanet to provide next-generation financial services better than current retail offerings. Although crypto-backed lending is still rare in conventional finance, institutional players are slowly entering the space. Standard Chartered and OKX recently piloted a program for institutional crypto collateral. Gerovich stated that Metaplanet will not pursue convertible debt to fund its acquisitions but would consider issuing preferred shares to avoid repayment obligations tied to volatile share prices. On Monday, the company resumed its aggressive buying spree by adding 2,204 BTC for $237 million at an average price of about $107,700 per coin. This raised its total holdings to 15,555 BTC , with an average purchase cost of $99,985 per Bitcoin. Despite limited revenue, Metaplanet’s stock soared more than 330% in 2025, pushing its market capitalization beyond $7 billion. The company’s approach is very similar to that of MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, which now holds over 597,000 BTC and has a market cap of $112 billion. Top public Bitcoin treasury companies (Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET ) VC Firm Backs Bitcoin-Only Startups Meanwhile, venture capital firm Ego Death Capital secured $100 million in funding from family offices and other investors to support early-stage Bitcoin companies. The firm plans to allocate the funds to Series A rounds for startups generating between $1 million and $3 million in annual revenue, according to founding partner Nico Leshuga. Speaking to Axios , Leshuga shared his strong conviction in Bitcoin’s role as a foundational technology, and described it as “the only decentralized and secure base to be able to build on.” Ego Death Capital’s strategic focus comes during a wave of institutional enthusiasm for Bitcoin, fueled by the strong performance of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States and the growth of corporate Bitcoin treasuries. The firm already invested in several Bitcoin-native startups, including Roxcom, a Bitcoin exchange; Relai, a savings platform; and Breez, a payment app built on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network. However, the firm drew a firm line on the scope of its investments. It does not plan to back hardware-oriented companies like miners or wallet manufacturers, nor is it interested in any projects involving other cryptocurrencies. This narrow focus distinguishes Ego Death Capital from other crypto venture firms. The timing of Ego Death’s new fund coincides with a rebound in venture capital funding in the crypto and blockchain space. According to CryptoRank , the second quarter saw a sharp uptick in funding, with a total of $10.03 billion raised. Over half of that, $5.14 billion, came in June alone. Among the standout deals were Vivek Ramaswamy’s $750 million Strive fundraise and the launch of 21 Capital, which raised $585 million for Bitcoin acquisitions. (Source: CryptoRank ) This resurgence was the strongest quarter for crypto venture capital since the first quarter of 2022, when investment levels reached $16.64 billion. Ego Death Capital’s focused strategy in this specific growing landscape means that it has a deepening belief that Bitcoin is not just a store of value, but a foundational platform for the next wave of innovation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-09 05:30:00

Related Reading: XRP Could Hit $35 If It Captures A Quarter Of Remittance Market By 2029 Arthur Britto, who co‑founded Ripple Labs in 2012, broke a 14‑year silence with a single emoji on X. That tiny message carried big weight. His name rarely surfaces in headlines, but his work helped build XRP into one of the top assets by market value. Impact Of A Secretive Founder According to reports, Britto kept a low profile while helping craft the XRP Ledger’s code. He holds a 2% stake in XRP under a deal made when the company launched. That slice of holdings could be worth billions if the token’s price ever climbed high enough. Some in the market worry that if Britto ever sold even part of that stake, it might send prices tumbling. 🚨⚠️ HE CO-CREATED THE XRP LEDGER. HE HOLDS 2% OF ALL XRP. HE’S NEVER BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC. Arthur Britto might be the most important figure in crypto you’ve never heard of. Let’s dive into the mystery.🧵👇 pic.twitter.com/xKyiYXIpGY — All Things XRP (@XRP_investing) July 5, 2025 The Satoshi Connection Based on reports, comparisons to Bitcoin’s creator have swirled around Britto for years. Some fans point to the fact that Satoshi Nakamoto’s last known post came just as the XRP Ledger went live. That timing alone has led people to whisper that Britto could be Satoshi under a different name. No proof supports that idea. Experts say it’s more likely just a coincidence. Britto’s lone emoji on X was verified by Ripple CTO David Schwartz. That confirmation set off a wave of theories about what might come next. Some speculated a new protocol update. Others thought it hinted at a partnership or a fresh product launch. So far, nothing public has followed the post. Behind The Scenes At PolySign While he stayed away from interviews, Britto never stopped working. He co‑founded PolySign, a crypto custody firm that now operates under Ripple Custody. That arm provides secure storage for institutions holding digital coins. Based on filings, PolySign handled an estimated $1.5 billion in assets last year. Its integration into Ripple’s services shows Britto’s influence lives on, even if his name doesn’t show up on conference schedules. Related Reading: Ethereum Sees $6 Billion In Tokenized Funds As Big Players Jump In Future Moves And Market Watch With XRP trading near its recent range, some investors say they’re watching for any hint of action from Britto’s wallet. Price targets in the community sometimes stretch to $10,000 per XRP. Those figures come without verification, and many traders treat them as wishful thinking. Still, a lot can happen if even a fraction of Britto’s holdings moves.

OpenAI warned earlier this month that the tokens being offered by Robinhood do not represent equity in the company, and any transfer of equity would require OpenAI's approval which they haven't given. ""In and of itself, I don't think it's entirely relevant that it's not technically an equity instrument,"" Tenev said on CNBC. ""What's important is that retail customers have an opportunity to get exposure to this asset."" Robinhood isn't the first platform to offer shares in pre-IPO companies with this model. Linqto, which offered retail investors exposure via special purpose vehicles that bought up shares on the secondary market, recently filed for bankruptcy , raising questions about what exactly its customers, now creditors, owned. Among the companies is Ripple (XRP), and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, has publicly distanced Ripple from Linqto.

The Analyst is NO,https://timestabloid.com/is-magacoin-finance-a-scam-the-analyst-is-no/,"In today’s rapidly evolving digital asset space, due diligence is everything. With thousands of cryptocurrencies launching each year, investors are right to ask questions, dig deeper, and seek clarity before making decisions. One question that often emerges about rising stars in the market is: Is MAGACOIN FINANCE a scam? The answer is a confident and professional no — and here’s why that conclusion is backed by serious insights, not speculation. Expert Perspective: What Defines Legitimacy in Crypto? To assess the legitimacy of any cryptocurrency project, analysts use a well-defined framework based on: Transparency of the team and project goals Smart contract verification and security audits Utility and long-term vision Community trust and organic growth Track record of performance and consistency MAGACOIN FINANCE meets — and in many ways exceeds — these industry standards. Transparent Vision, Clear Communication A legitimate project always begins with clarity. MAGACOIN FINANCE has laid out a clear mission , backed by a passionate team that emphasizes patriotic values, decentralized ownership, and broad appeal. Their official channels, including their website and social platforms , offer straightforward, jargon-free explanations of their objectives, how the tokenomics work, and where the project is heading next.

MAGACOIN FINANCE’s smart contract has been publicly verified , allowing anyone to explore its logic. This transparency removes any mystery about what the code does and ensures that it functions as promised. Furthermore, early feedback from the broader development community and blockchain auditors has shown no red flags . The structure is sound, and there is no evidence of malicious backdoors, honey pots, or exploitable mechanics — common warning signs in dishonest tokens. Community-Driven Strength A scam cannot sustain genuine community traction. MAGACOIN FINANCE has demonstrated rapid, organic growth powered by real supporters.

His testimony emphasizes that XRP is not a security, Ripple holds over 60 global licenses, and U.S. crypto policy is forcing innovation offshore. With the hearing titled “From Wall Street to Web3,” Garlinghouse urges Congress to act, stating, “Money should move like information and XRP is the key.” This marks a major turning point for Ripple, placing XRP at the center of crypto legislation debates. July 9, 2025 05:39:39 UTC XRP Price Could Soar if SEC Ends Ripple Case This Saturday Speculation is mounting that the SEC could announce the end of its case against Ripple this Saturday. If that happens, analysts believe it could signal a coordinated shift, including Fedwire adopting Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) alongside ISO20022 standards. Such a move would align the U.S. financial infrastructure with blockchain-based systems, potentially positioning XRP at the core. Market watchers say this could lead to a massive price breakout for XRP, driven by utility, clarity, and institutional confidence. If true, XRP may soon reach levels the market hasn’t yet imagined.

This marks a dramatic shift in U.S. political alignment with crypto, especially XRP, which has long faced regulatory pressure. The move could legitimize XRP on Wall Street, offering institutional access and reshaping its narrative.

As the first-ever meme coin, Dogecoin has carved a legendary status in the crypto world. Known for its viral appeal and loyal community, it continues to dominate headlines and investor watchlists. Following Donald Trump’s election win, renewed interest in DOGE surged, further fueled by speculation around a potential Dogecoin ETF approval by the U.S. SEC.

On the other hand, if the market is hit again by external forces like regulations or negative statements by influencers. Hence, the meme coin might trade at a potential low of $ 0.62 . We expect the DOGE price to reach a new swing high of $1.07 by the end of 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.62 $0.84 $1.07 DOGE Price Analysis July 2025 Dogecoin may have started 2025 on the back foot, but with growing optimism surrounding a potential DOGE ETF approval and increasing interest from social media, the price could surge to approximately $0.25 in July 2025. Under higher bullish momentum, it could even retest the formidable resistance at $0.39, which has proven challenging to overcome. However, if the demand zone at $0.130 – $0.150 is breached, then $0.10 could be hit. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) DOGE Price Target July 2025 0.10 0.25 0.39 DOGE Price Forecast 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE) continues to capture investor attention, primarily due to its history of delivering remarkable returns. One notable surge occurred in November 2024, following Donald Trump’s presidential election victory, which propelled the price to a peak of $0.4846 by year-end. However, profit-taking around this peak created a supply zone, triggering a downward trend. In January 2025, bulls made an effort to sustain the gains from Q4 2024. Yet, the high volume profile resistance at $0.39 proved formidable, pushing the price down to a low of $0.130 by early April. Interestingly, april’s low is near the demand zone at $0.130 – $0.150 that has previously supported a parabolic rally, and bulls are seen active in this area. Over the past couple of months, this level has been tested several times and has proven strong for bears to break that easily. Also, the most recent support taken by DOGE is in the final week of June, and since then, the price in the past 15 days is consolidating near the upper boundary of a downward wedge. A bullish reawakening at this level could pump a breakout to $0.25 level in July or could even retest the $0.39 high volume zone. Additionally, optimism around a potential DOGE ETF approval is growing. If approved, it could spark significant adoption, potentially flipping $0.39 and propelling the price beyond the previous high of $0.484 and setting the stage for a new bullish trajectory. In such a scenario, DOGE reaching $1 is not out of the question. On the flip side, if DOGE is rejected at the $0.39 resistance level by the end of 2025, it may retrace back to the demand zone near $0.13, posing renewed challenges for investors.

A sustained media frenzy and growing endorsement deals could maintain bullish momentum. Expanded merchant adoption would also strengthen confidence in its long-term viability. Dogecoin’s Tokenomics and Long-Term Outlook The future of Dogecoin hinges on its utility. Meme popularity alone may not sustain it indefinitely, but advancements in transaction fees, speed, and business collaborations could help it thrive as a mainstream digital currency.

During the APEX 2025 Event, Garlinghouse made clear that Ripple is aiming beyond traditional cross-border messaging systems. Rather than trying to displace SWIFT on its terms, Ripple is targeting liquidity, the core of financial value movement. Garlinghouse explained that there are two parts of SWIFT’s system: “There’s messaging, and there’s liquidity. Liquidity is owned by the banks.” He went on to clarify that Ripple’s long-term objective is not just to offer an alternative communication network for financial institutions, but to power the actual flow of money across borders. BRAD GARLINGHOUSE SAYS IT LOUD AND CLEAR #XRP WILL STEAL SWIFTS CUSTOMERS!!! pic.twitter.com/64WtW6OUm3 — FinanceBro (@FinanceBroYT) July 6, 2025 Liquidity Over Messaging While much of the global conversation around SWIFT alternatives has focused on messaging protocols and ISO 20022 alignment , Garlinghouse emphasized that the true opportunity lies elsewhere. “I think less about the messaging and more about liquidity,” he said, indicating that Ripple’s strategy is to insert itself directly into the heart of global financial plumbing. Ripple’s XRP-powered On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) platform already serves multiple corridors across the globe . This enables financial institutions to send money without pre-funded accounts. As more institutions adopt blockchain-based payment rails, Ripple’s value proposition becomes increasingly appealing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 14% Market Share Target At the APEX 2025 Event, the CEO predicted that Ripple would capture 14% of SWIFT’s current volume within five years . This prediction shows Ripple’s growing confidence in institutional adoption of XRP for cross-border settlement. With the company expanding partnerships and pursuing banking licenses in key jurisdictions, the 14% target appears to represent a broader strategic framework. Importantly, this projection does not merely reflect technical potential but speaks to Ripple’s understanding of legacy banking systems and their limitations. By focusing on liquidity rather than competing head-on with SWIFT’s messaging infrastructure, Ripple may be positioning itself to serve use cases where SWIFT remains inefficient or cost-prohibitive, and potentially replace the legacy system in the long term. XRP as the Future of Finance The implications of this shift are significant for XRP. If Ripple controls the liquidity layer of international payments, demand for XRP as a bridge asset could increase substantially. Garlinghouse’s focus on liquidity suggests that Ripple is preparing for a future in which XRP plays a central role in institutional finance. While it remains to be seen whether Ripple can capture the projected 14% share, Garlinghouse’s remarks reflect a belief that XRP will power the next phase of financial innovation.

Price prediction for 2025 suggests a potential high of $32. Long-term forecasts indicate LINK could reach $195 by 2030. Chainlink has emerged as a game-changing decentralized oracle network, enabling smart contracts to connect seamlessly with real-world data, APIs, and traditional financial systems. As the crypto market evolves, Chainlink’s role continues to expand—especially with its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) gaining traction. Its native token, LINK, not only powers the ecosystem but has also caught the attention of investors and analysts. With LINK price showing signs of a potential breakout and strong on-chain fundamentals backing its rise, the big question remains: Can LINK coin price hit $50 in 2025? Let’s dive into this detailed Chainlink price prediction 2025–2030 to find out. Table of Contents Overview Chainlink Price Target July 2025 LINK Price Prediction 2025 Chainlink Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Market Analysis CoinPedia’s Chainlink Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Chainlink Token LINK Price $ 14.05958119 5.54% Market Cap $ 9,533,801,587.7776 Trading Volume $ 364,601,766.8571 Circulating Supply 678,099,970.4528 All-time High $52.88 May 10, 2021 All-time Low $0.1263 Sep 23, 2017 Chainlink Price Target July 2025 In July 2025, Chainlink (LINK) is trying to reverse the decline from mid-May caused by a change in geopolitical factors. The end of June showed bullish reawakening in the short term as LINK price seeks a retest of the $18 neckline. This retest is essential for sustaining its upward momentum. The price is currently trying to stabilize around the $13 mark, and a successful break above the $18 level could signal a bullish trend. But if $13 breaks, then it might pull back to $10. LINK Price Prediction 2025 In 2025, Chainlink (LINK) started the year on a downward path, but by April, the tide began to turn. Early in the month, LINK began its recovery from a low of $10.067. By May, it had formed a bullish rounded bottom pattern, with a crucial neckline set at $18. However, since mid-May, LINK has faced challenges in maintaining its position near this neckline. By the third week of June, it pulled back toward the support level of the rounded bottom, which coincides with a multi-year support zone around $11. In the final week of June, LINK’s price began to rise again, but in past 15-days it is attempting to hold steady near the key $13 mark. If bullish momentum continues, LINK could aim to retest the neckline at $18 in July. For this price advance to sustain itself in the long term, LINK must break above and close daily above the $18 neckline. Such a move could signal a potential upward trend, increasing the chances of retesting the $24 resistance level in Q3 and Q4. This area is supported by a high-volume profile from earlier in the year. If LINK manages to surpass the $24 mark, projections for late 2025 suggest that the token could soar as high as $32.

According to Peterson, the period he calls the “Bitcoin Bastille Day Rally” will begin on July 14, which the analyst believes could herald a significant recovery phase for Bitcoin. Peterson, in his analysis based on historical data, noted that in years where Bitcoin underperforms, it typically experiences a strong rally starting around Bastille Day. He explained that this rally typically begins on July 14th and lasts until July 30th, noting that this two-week period is a critical time for Bitcoin to recoup its losses from the year. Related News: The Country Where Tether (USDT) Is Keeping Tons of Its Gold Has Been Revealed - Here Are the Details However, this rise also comes with a warning for investors: According to Peterson, the ten-week period following this two-week recovery period stands out as one of the weakest performing periods for Bitcoin historically. Peterson also noted that Bitcoin behaves like a “compressed spring,” arguing that historically, Bitcoin has seen an average rise of at least 16% in positive months. However, this year, this figure has only been 9% so far. This suggests that strong moves above 16% are possible in the coming positive months, according to the analyst. *This is not investment advice.

Analysts predict PEPE could reach $0.000028 by 2025. Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $0.0002733 by 2030. Pepe Coin (PEPE), the memecoin inspired by the iconic frog meme, has rapidly become a standout in the crypto world. Ranked just behind Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE’s explosive rise—boasting gains of over +116,604,556% from its all-time low—has captured investor attention globally. As it maintains its position among top memecoins, many are now asking: Will PEPE price go parabolic by the end of 2025? In this article, explore CoinPedia’s in-depth PEPE coin price prediction for 2025, and discover long-term forecasts that look ahead to 2030. Table of contents Story Highlights Overview Pepe Coin Price Prediction July 2025 Pepe Price Prediction 2025 PEPE Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 PEPE Coin Market Analysis CoinPedia’s PEPE Price Prediction FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Pepe Token PEPE Price $ 0.00001016 2.30% Market Cap $ 4,273,897,745.0813 Trading Volume $ 625,077,211.6158 Circulating Supply 420,689,899,653,543.5625 All-time High $0.00002825 Dec 09, 2024 All-time Low $0.0…01062 Apr 14, 2023 Pepe Coin Price Prediction July 2025 In July, if PEPE can break above $0.00001050 and regain the short-term EMA of the 20-day and 50-day, there is potential for a move toward $0.00001350 or even $0.00001688. However, this will require an increase in trading volume and support from the broader market. On the other hand, if the bulls fail to maintain the $0.00000850 level, a retest of $0.00000760 or even $0.00000610 is likely. Falling below $0.00000610 would put PEPE at risk of reaching new lows. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Pepecoin Price Forecast July 2025 0.00000610 0.00001050 0.00001688 Pepe Price Prediction 2025 Pepe Coin is showing potential for growth in 2025. Initially seen as a joke, meme coins like PEPE, Dogecoin, and SHIB have found their place in the market, driven by social media excitement. With the PEPE brand still strong, a resurgence may be on the way as social buzz returns. In the first half of 2025, the PEPE price dropped by 65%. Despite a rally in Q2 that peaked at $0.00001610 by mid-May, the overall trend remains down, and it fell 40% from the mid-May peak to the end of June. As we move into July, PEPE crypto’s technical chart shows signs of life. After bouncing off key support in late June, bulls tried to rally but faced resistance again. Currently, PEPE price remains in a broader downtrend, with the Q2 decline forming a falling wedge pattern. Interestingly, the price action in Q2 aligns with Elliott Wave theory. After five impulsive waves and three corrective waves, the recent wave 3 has provided support, suggesting a potential market shift. At this stage PEPE price is indicating that bulls are reawakening in July. That said, Q3 could see the start of a new impulsive wave 1, as selling pressure appears to have diminished. In the short term, if the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands flip, PEPE’s first impulse wave may encounter resistance around $0.00001350. Following that, the Fibonacci 0.5 level at $0.00001688 could also act as resistance, as shown on the daily chart. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has recently bounced back from oversold territory, indicating that the cooldown phase may be ending, paving the way for a rally. If PEPE price regains bullish momentum and completes a new wave 1, it could lead to a wave 2 a short pullback. After wave 2, a decisive breakout above $0.00001688 would confirm the third wave, potentially pushing PEPE to $0.00002837 by late 2025. For a bullish outlook, breaking the Fibonacci 0.5 level is essential. However, failing to surpass $0.00001688 could trigger a trend reversal and lead to a price pullback.

47862046,https://coinpaper.com/9856/ripple-testifies-before-senate-while-investor-declares-bankruptcy,1752040800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Ripple Testifies Before Senate While Investor Declares Bankruptcy,https://coinpaper.com/9856/ripple-testifies-before-senate-while-investor-declares-bankruptcy,"Ripple is facing scrutiny on two fronts this week as CEO Brad Garlinghouse testifies before the Senate Banking Committee in support of clearer crypto regulation, while investment platform Linqto, which holds 4.7 million Ripple shares, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The simultaneous developments show both Ripple’s growing presence in Washington policy circles and the risks emerging in the opaque world of secondary crypto markets. Linqto’s bankruptcy filing comes amid SEC investigations, internal allegations of investor misrepresentation, and broader questions about market structure—raising the stakes in an already critical moment for US crypto regulation. Senate Banking Committee to Hear From Ripple, Blockchain Association, and Chainalysis CEOs as Crypto Legislation Gains Momentum As the United States Congress inches closer to a long-awaited overhaul of digital asset regulation, key industry leaders and former regulators will appear before the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday to discuss the future of crypto oversight. The hearing marks a pivotal moment as lawmakers prepare to shape what could become the most comprehensive crypto legislative framework in US history. Executives scheduled to testify include Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, Blockchain Association CEO and former CFTC Commissioner Summer Mersinger, former CFTC Chair Timothy Massad, and Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin. Their testimonies will address market structure, consumer protection, innovation, and the US's global competitiveness in digital finance. A Defining Moment for US Crypto Regulation Senators are expected to engage in high-stakes discussions about two landmark bills already circulating through Congress—the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act, and the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act. Both pieces of legislation aim to provide clearer regulatory guardrails for cryptocurrencies and blockchain platforms. “We are at a critical inflection point,” said Mersinger in prepared remarks. “The choice before us is not whether to regulate this industry, but how. We can either continue down a path of uncertainty that cedes our leadership and exports this innovation to other countries, or we can enact sensible, bipartisan legislation that cements our position as the premier destination for financial innovation for decades to come.” The hearing will give the Senate its first major opportunity to signal how it might approach comprehensive crypto legislation after the House moved forward with its own version during the start of what it’s calling “Crypto Week.” On Monday, the House of Representatives kicked off its legislative focus on crypto with plans to vote on three key bills: The GENIUS Act, already passed by the Senate, which would establish a framework for stablecoins backed by the US dollar. The CLARITY Act, which designates the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as the lead agency for digital commodities while granting the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversight of crypto-related securities. A controversial anti-CBDC bill, aimed at halting the development of a US central bank digital currency. The push by Republican leadership to advance this legislation highlights a growing urgency to solidify US dominance in digital asset markets before the 2024 election cycle fully consumes the political landscape. Potential Conflicts Loom Over Trump Ties However, the political backdrop of the hearing is anything but clean. President Donald Trump’s growing involvement in the crypto space has raised eyebrows, especially as lawmakers debate bills that could benefit projects with links to him. Ripple, one of the companies at the center of the crypto lobbying effort, previously donated $5 million worth of XRP to Trump’s inaugural fund. Garlinghouse also attended a White House crypto summit hosted by Trump earlier this year. His appearance before Congress could intensify scrutiny of Ripple’s role in shaping policy. Adding more complexity, Trump and his family are reportedly affiliated with World Liberty Financial, a crypto firm that issued the USD1 stablecoin and played a role in launching Trump’s own meme coin earlier this year. To address potential ethical breaches, Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer, will also testify. His presence signals concerns that regulatory efforts may be influenced by personal or political financial interests, especially as crypto becomes an election talking point. While the GENIUS Act ultimately passed the Senate with bipartisan support in June, its path was initially marred by resistance from Democrats concerned about Trump’s growing involvement in crypto. Several withdrew support during the bill’s initial vote in May, citing the need to protect the legislative process from undue political influence. Those concerns have not dissipated. Some Democratic lawmakers have privately indicated they will continue to scrutinize crypto-related legislation where conflicts of interest may exist, especially as the Trump family expands its financial footprint in the digital asset industry. Industry Prepares for Regulatory Clarity Despite the political drama, many in the industry view this week’s events as a rare opportunity for progress. Jonathan Levin, whose firm Chainalysis helps law enforcement and government agencies monitor blockchain activity, is expected to emphasize the importance of transparency and data-driven policymaking. With global crypto trading volumes rebounding and institutional interest growing, market participants are eager for clarity. Firms want rules that allow them to innovate while maintaining compliance and protecting consumers. Linqto Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Amid Federal Probes and Ripple Share Controversy Meanwhile, Linqto, a prominent private investment platform known for offering fractional shares in pre-IPO companies, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas. The filing follows a wave of federal scrutiny, internal investigations, and public controversies surrounding its handling of investor funds, including its high-profile holdings in Ripple Labs. The bankruptcy, officially submitted on Monday, comes amid mounting concerns over Linqto's regulatory compliance and transparency practices. Although the company controls a substantial holding of 4.7 million Ripple shares—purchased on the secondary market—it has no formal relationship with the blockchain giant, a distinction Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse emphasized in a recent statement. An excerpt from Linqto’s voluntary petition for bankruptcy (Source: Epiq) “Apart from Linqto being a shareholder, Ripple has never had a business relationship with Linqto, nor have they participated in our financing rounds,” Garlinghouse clarified in a post on X (formerly Twitter) last week. Linqto’s 4.7 million Ripple shares were acquired privately through its investment vehicle, Liquidshares. While the exact timing and purchase price remain unclear, estimates from private market data provider Forge suggest the stake could be worth approximately $450 million based on a current secondary market share price of $95.5. However, recent court filings suggest Linqto believes its broader portfolio of private securities, including stakes in 111 companies, has an estimated fair market value exceeding $500 million. Ripple’s share price on the secondary market (Source: Forge) Despite these potentially significant valuations, there is uncertainty over the liquidity of Ripple’s secondary shares. According to Phil Haslett, co-founder of EquityZen, a leading private market platform, Ripple has initiated a $700 million tender offer at $175 per share, effectively pausing most secondary share transactions. “Ripple secondaries are generally paused while the company completes its reported $700 million tender offer,” Haslett said. “Before the tender, we observed prices around $70 to $75 per [Ripple] share.” Accusations of Fraud and Regulatory Violations Linqto’s financial troubles first came into public view on June 30 when The Wall Street Journal reported that the firm faced multiple federal investigations and was considering bankruptcy. According to internal memos obtained by the outlet, Linqto allegedly misled customers into believing they owned actual shares in private companies, when they may not have. Worse still, the company may have marketed these investments to unqualified investors in violation of US securities law. Linqto’s new CEO, Dan Siciliano, acknowledged the gravity of the situation in a statement shared internally. “Much of what we discovered about the prior business practices at Linqto is disturbing,” Siciliano said. “These practices aren’t small one-off, compliance or common regulatory missteps.” One of the most alarming revelations includes an alleged markup scheme by former CEO William Sarris, who reportedly sold Ripple shares to Linqto’s 11,000 users at a markup of over 60%—far beyond the 10% threshold set by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). That action alone, if confirmed, could represent a clear violation of federal securities laws. SEC Investigation and Lawsuits Mount A Tuesday court filing indicated that Linqto improperly structured its series LLCs and failed to obtain transfer permissions from issuing companies like Ripple . These issues are now part of an ongoing SEC investigation, which the company acknowledged in bankruptcy court documents. Adding to its legal woes, former Chief Revenue Officer Gene Zawrotny filed a whistleblower lawsuit against Linqto and its former top executives, alleging widespread compliance failures and internal retaliation. The suit specifically names Sarris and former Chief Operating Officer Joe Endoso. Linqto officially closed its investment platform on March 13, effectively halting all revenue-generating operations. According to filings, the company’s liabilities may significantly outweigh its accessible assets, placing investors and creditors in a precarious position. The company’s first bankruptcy hearing is scheduled for Tuesday at 9:00 PM UTC. Witnesses include Chief Restructuring Officer Jeffrey Stein, Epiq Corporate Restructuring’s Kate Mailloux, and Ryan Hamilton, senior vice president for debt advisory at Jefferies. In the lead-up to the hearing, Linqto responded to public speculation about changes to its Ripple share holdings. In a statement published on Monday, the company said: “Contrary to published reports on X, Linqto confirms that Liquidshares’ holdings of Ripple shares remain unchanged, and as confirmed by Ripple last week, Linqto continues to own 4.7 million shares.” Ripple Distances Itself from Linqto Ripple has been keen to distance itself from the embattled investment firm. In late 2024, Ripple halted Linqto’s access to secondary Ripple shares, reportedly after the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) completed a review of Linqto’s broker-dealer unit, Linqto Capital. Garlinghouse reiterated that Linqto was never authorized to resell or manage Ripple’s shares and had no approval to market them in violation of securities rules.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-09 06:00:00

As part of the integration, OpenSea is recognizing Rally’s earliest supporters, the holders of Floor Genesis NFTs. These NFTs were originally issued as access passes to the first private beta builds of Rally’s early app, then named Floor. Holders played a key role in shaping product direction through feedback and testing. OpenSea now plans to convert these NFTs into tiered Treasures, special reward tokens within the OpenSea ecosystem designed to acknowledge meaningful user contributions. A snapshot mechanism will be used to facilitate the reward conversion, and eligible holders can use the OpenSea Rewards portal to claim their Treasures.

Although they acknowledged that it was a challenging prediction to make given their speculative nature, all four backed the same horse. Who’s First? Leaving aside the communities behind both cryptocurrencies and their respective ecosystems, this article will focus on what ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Grok answered when asked the same question: Will XRP hit $10 first, or will ETH reach $10,000 first? Historically, Ether had come closer to its rather tall goal as it surged to almost $5,000 back in 2021. In contrast, XRP’s all-time high was at $3.4 in January 2018, and the asset only managed to match it in 2025. Although ETH is slightly closer to its target now, the difference is negligible as both require rather similar price increases (of around 300%) to reach their respective goals. While this sounds significant, especially for the two largest altcoins, let’s not forget that XRP experienced an even more remarkable price surge in late 2024 and early 2025. All AI solutions admitted that ETH appears as the more likely horse to win this race. They laid out its path toward the $10,000 target, claiming that ecosystem growth, network upgrades, RWA tokenization, and institutional adoption will push it higher. ChatGPT was particularly interested in the institutional adoption segment, indicating that ETH has an advantage not just because of the ETF demand it sees, but also due to the growing number of companies that have recently started storing ether as a reserve asset. Some even dumped BTC to buy more ETH. “Ethereum hitting $10,000 first seems more probable in the medium term. Its established ecosystem, ongoing technological advancements (especially the impact of spot ETFs), and its central role in the broader crypto space (DeFi, NFTs, RWA tokenization) provide a more diverse and robust set of drivers. The percentage increase required for Ethereum is also slightly lower than for XRP to reach $10.” – concluded Gemini but the sentiment was echoed by all other AIs. XRP’s Case Although the AI chatbots seemed conclusive in picking ETH as the potential winner, they also outlined the less probable scenario in which XRP goes into double-digit price territory first. Gemini said that its path is “contingent on regulatory clarity and widespread institutional adoption for cross-border payments.” Grok noted that Ripple’s token can reach $10 if the company behind it continues with its massive partnerships and acquisitions, which could increase the overall trust in the project. Recall that the company spent over $1.2 billion earlier this year to acquire the prime brokerage giant Hidden Road, a move described by the community as a “game-changer” for XRP . Additionally, all four AIs highlighted the potential approval of spot XRP ETF in the States, the odds of which are over 90% , according to experts and Polymarket. This would open the doors for institutions to invest in XRP through regulated financial vehicles, which should, in theory, act as a price booster.

With this, the top 10 tokens like Ethereum, XRP, Solana, Tron, Dogecoin and Cardano, hold above their respective support. Meanwhile, Cronos price spiked heavily due to the external factors, while the other tokens attracted notable gains. Therefore, the current crypto markets appear to be largely stable, with the market capitalisation and volume remaining within a range. Although the BTC price is an inch close to its ATH, the market sentiments continue to remain neutral, while the star token continues to hold a huge dominance. Besides, Cronos (CRO) and Raydium (RAY) attract double-digit gains, followed by popular memecoins. Meanwhile, the other tokens attract decent gains, hinting towards the markets experiencing a stabilized state. Cronos Settles After A Massive Breakout The CRO price experienced a pullback of nearly 5% after rising by more than 22% following the inclusion in the Truth Social Blue-Chip ETF filing . The token not only broke above the multi-month consolidated zone but also attracted volume that surged from levels around $10 million to as high as $230 million within a few hours. The long-term price action appears bearish as the sellers have booked the profit, but the short-term price action hints towards a drop in their actions as well. The CRO price is trying hard to hold the local support at $0.0897, which may offer a strong bullish rebound. The StochRSI has reached the oversold range, while the hourly MACD displays a rise in the selling pressure. However, the chart pattern suggests the support could be held firmly, which may further reinstitute a strong upswing back to the local highs and eventually achieve $0.1. Raydium Preparing for a Parabolic Recovery Raydium is climbing steadily with a significant rise in the buying pressure and is currently trading at $2.42 with a huge rise of over 13% in the past 24 hours. The token broke the $2.3 level with a strong bounce after bouncing from the $2.01 lows. This breakout is backed by a massive rise in the volume and a clean trend. RAY price appears to be undergoing a parabolic recovery that initiated before the start of the month. The latest rise pushed the price above the 50-day MA, which is now serving as a temporary support. A daily close above the levels could validate the rise, but until then, the fear of the pullback may haunt the rally. On the other hand, the RSI is incremental, which hints towards the rising strength of the rally. Therefore, the next levels to look out for are $2.42, followed by $2.56 and $2.7.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRO|RAY|MARKET|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-09 06:12:35

If that happens, the years-long legal battle could wrap up in a matter of days or weeks. Regulatory clarity is finally within reach, and the future for XRP is starting to look a lot clearer. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse is all set to testify before the Senate today with a sharp focus on XRP and regulatory clarity in the U.S. He has shared his full testimony ahead of the hearing. My full testimony for the hearing is available here: https://t.co/NHTh8wKQMc — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 8, 2025 In the testimony, Brad highlights Ripple’s decade-long mission to build an “Internet of Value,” where money moves seamlessly like information. He also stressed Ripple’s compliance-first approach, highlighting over 60 licenses and ongoing work with regulators. Ripple vs. SEC: A Legal Battle Close To Being Resolved Garlinghouse shared that smart crypto regulation should protect consumers, keep bad actors in check, make sure markets are well overseen, and still leave room for innovation. He also pointed out the damage that was caused due to years of regulatory uncertainty, which drove innovation and jobs offshore. He notes that Ripple was the first major U.S. crypto company that was sued by the SEC in 2020. Brad Outlines 3 Key Priorities Ahead After a four-year legal battle, Ripple won a landmark ruling: the court determined that XRP is not a security. He underscored that the win was not just a victory for Ripple but for the entire U.S. crypto industry. Despite these challenges, Ripple continues to engage with lawmakers and regulators, stressing the need for smart and clearer crypto rules. He has outlined three key priorities for Congress: Firstly, clearly define the roles of financial regulators, secondly, create safe pathways for companies to innovate in the U.S., and finally, a real plan to ensure that the U.S. can be a global crypto leader. Brad says that the U.S. has everything it needs to lead in the blockchain. With over 55 million Americans involved in crypto and a $3.4 trillion market cap, a clear regulatory framework is long overdue. Brad Urges to Push CLARITY Act Forward He also called on the Senate to prioritize passing the crypto market structure bill (The CLARITY Act) for digital assets. This would spark a new wave of innovation and bring major benefits to both consumers and businesses. Ripple, he added, is ready to work with lawmakers to help make that future a reality. Tomorrow, on July 10th, the SEC will hold a closed-door meeting.

Analysts have warned that this could erect a “tariff wall” that disrupts regional supply chains and raises prices for American consumers. Trump’s new threats come as an August 1st deadline for trade deals approaches. He said he planned to impose new tariffs , from 25% to 40%, on countries including Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, and Thailand. These countries have become primary port calls for a shuffle of Chinese goods redirected to skirt current US tariffs. Vietnam, the largest in this chain of trans-shipping, receives a 20% tariff on the goods it exports to the US and gets hit with 40% on the re-routed goods. Trump says the tariffs will generate more than $300 billion by the end of the year, beginning with what he called “big money” starting to come in from August. Tariffs reshape global supply chains While Trump’s attitude may strike a chord with those inclined toward protectionism, warning bells are being sounded by economists and trade experts. They warn that creating a “tariff wall” around Southeast Asia would cause major disruptions in global supply chains and raise costs for consumers and businesses in the United States. There’s still room for countries like Malaysia, Cambodia, and Thailand to haggle for better terms on the way to the negotiations with Washington, said Alicia García Herrero, the chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis. She said the tariff deal struck with Vietnam should not become a template for the region. Regardless of the final tariff levels agreed upon, prices for goods exported from Southeast Asia are expected to rise under Trump’s plan. The region remains a major manufacturing hub for US consumer products, making it likely that cost increases will ripple through American markets. “Manufacturing will get more expensive in Asia generally, but in principle the 20% ‘tariff wall’ might be different across countries where inputs from China are smaller. I don’t think it has to be the same,” she said. Mark Williams, chief Asia economist at Capital Economics, warned that enforcing the proposed tariffs could be inconsistent and unpredictable. With different rates potentially applied across countries and industries, he said the lack of clarity may lead to confusion and inefficiencies throughout global trade networks. Williams also added that tariffs on Southeast Asian countries could have unintended consequences. He said that many companies had moved operations from China to countries like Vietnam and Indonesia during the first term of Trump’s presidency to escape the existing tariffs. But he warned that the erection of a new tariff wall could hamper this trend. If the difference between tariffs on China and those in other countries nearby became smaller, he said, the motivation for businesses to move would wane, possibly stalling the momentum of supply chain diversification. Rising costs squeeze shoppers under new tariff rules Even steep tariffs are unlikely to achieve Trump’s goal of returning manufacturing to the US. American industries often lack the scale and cost advantages needed to replace Asian production . According to Williams, US companies and consumers would face a dilemma: either absorb higher costs for imported goods or go without them. He noted that domestic production remains uncompetitive in many sectors, even with tariffs. This raises the risk of inflation for American consumers. Since tariffs are essentially taxes on imports, their costs typically fall on consumers. And because global supply chains are deeply intertwined, even minor policy shifts can trigger widespread ripple effects. At the same time, tougher rules on “trans-shipped” goods—those routed through third countries—could lead to stricter scrutiny once products reach US ports. This, in turn, could pave the way for new industries focused on compliance and processing to emerge.

U.S. President Donald Trump has revealed via Truth Social that a pivotal July 9 Announcement is set to disclose critical trade decisions affecting at least seven countries, with more details to follow throughout the day. While the cryptocurrency market often dances to its own tune, macro-economic shifts and geopolitical moves, like the upcoming Trump Trade Policy unveilings, undeniably ripple through all financial sectors, including digital assets. Understanding these broader economic currents is vital for any investor, making this announcement a must-watch event. What is the Trump Trade Policy All About? To grasp the potential ramifications of the upcoming announcements, it’s essential to recall the core tenets of the Trump Trade Policy . During his previous term, President Trump championed an “America First” approach, often characterized by a willingness to impose tariffs and renegotiate existing trade agreements. The underlying philosophy was to protect American industries and jobs, reduce trade deficits, and ensure what he perceived as fair trade practices. This often led to: Bilateral Negotiations: A preference for one-on-one deals rather than multilateral agreements. Tariff Imposition: Strategic use of tariffs on imported goods, particularly from countries deemed to be engaging in unfair trade practices. Re-evaluation of Existing Deals: Renegotiating or withdrawing from agreements like NAFTA (which became USMCA) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). This approach often created friction with major trading partners but also resulted in new agreements. The upcoming July 9 Announcement suggests a continuation, or perhaps an escalation, of this assertive stance, setting the stage for renewed discussions around global commerce. How Will This Impact Global Trade Dynamics? The disclosure of new trade decisions, especially concerning multiple countries, has the potential to significantly alter Global Trade dynamics. When a major economic power like the United States adjusts its trade stance, it creates a cascade of effects. Countries facing new tariffs or restrictions might retaliate, leading to trade wars that disrupt supply chains and increase costs for consumers. Conversely, countries that are favored could see increased trade volumes and economic benefits. Here’s how this could play out: Supply Chain Realignments: Businesses may need to find new suppliers or production locations to avoid tariffs, leading to costly and time-consuming adjustments. Price Fluctuations: Tariffs typically increase the cost of imported goods, which can be passed on to consumers, potentially fueling inflation. Shifting Alliances: Countries might seek new trade partners or strengthen existing alliances to mitigate the impact of U.S. decisions. The specific countries named on July 9 will dictate the immediate impact, but the broader message will resonate across all international markets, influencing everything from commodity prices to manufacturing strategies. What is the Potential Economic Impact? The direct and indirect Economic Impact of these trade decisions could be far-reaching. For businesses, changes in trade policy mean a re-evaluation of strategies, potential restructuring, and navigating new regulatory landscapes. For consumers, it could mean higher prices or reduced availability of certain goods. Let’s consider some key areas: Sector/Area Potential Impact Considerations Manufacturing Increased costs for imported raw materials; potential for reshoring production if tariffs make imports too expensive. Job creation in some areas, but higher consumer prices due to increased domestic production costs. Retail & Consumer Goods Higher prices on imported goods, reduced consumer purchasing power. Shift towards domestically produced alternatives, if available. Agriculture Vulnerability to retaliatory tariffs from affected countries, impacting exports. Government subsidies or new market exploration may be needed. Technology Impact on supply chains for electronics components; potential for restrictions on tech transfers. Innovation could be stifled or accelerated depending on the nature of restrictions. The Economic Impact is not uniform; some sectors may benefit from reduced foreign competition, while others could face significant headwinds. Investors will be closely watching for signals of inflationary pressure or shifts in corporate earnings reports linked to these changes. Navigating Future Trade Relations: Challenges and Opportunities? The upcoming announcement will undoubtedly reshape existing Trade Relations and potentially forge new ones. For the countries involved, the challenge will be to adapt quickly, whether through diplomatic engagement, economic diversification, or seeking new alliances. For the United States, the opportunity lies in reinforcing its economic leverage and potentially rebalancing what it perceives as unfair trade practices. Challenges: Diplomatic Strain: Unilateral trade actions can strain diplomatic ties, impacting cooperation on other global issues. Retaliation: Affected countries may impose their own tariffs or restrictions, leading to a cycle of escalation. Uncertainty: The lack of predictability in trade policy can deter long-term investment and planning for businesses. Opportunities: New Agreements: The pressure from tariffs can sometimes lead to more favorable trade agreements for the imposing country. Domestic Growth: Protecting domestic industries can stimulate local production and job creation. Strategic Realignments: It can force countries to diversify their economic partnerships, potentially strengthening new geopolitical blocs. The art of navigating these complex Trade Relations will be a defining feature of international diplomacy in the coming months. Why is the July 9 Announcement So Significant? The July 9 Announcement carries immense weight not just because of the decisions themselves, but because of the way they are being unveiled. A simultaneous disclosure involving at least seven countries signals a coordinated and assertive move by the U.S. administration. This isn’t a piecemeal adjustment but a comprehensive statement of intent regarding future Global Trade policy. The fact that more countries are expected to be named later in the day adds to the suspense and underscores the breadth of this policy shift. It creates an immediate need for businesses, governments, and investors worldwide to react and strategize, ensuring they are not caught off guard by the evolving landscape of Trade Relations . Actionable Insights for the Crypto Investor and Beyond While trade policy might seem distant from the world of digital assets, its Economic Impact is undeniable. Here’s how to think about it: Macroeconomic Sensitivity: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, while sometimes uncorrelated, are increasingly influenced by macro-economic factors. Trade wars can lead to inflation, which some see as a catalyst for Bitcoin adoption, or conversely, economic downturns that reduce risk appetite across all asset classes. Currency Volatility: If trade decisions lead to significant volatility in fiat currencies, some investors might turn to stablecoins or even Bitcoin as a hedge, particularly in affected nations. Supply Chain Disruptions: If tariffs severely disrupt global supply chains, it could lead to increased interest in blockchain solutions for logistics and provenance, creating new use cases for certain crypto projects. Stay informed about the specifics of the July 9 Announcement . Monitor how traditional markets react, particularly indices related to manufacturing, exports, and imports. These shifts can provide clues about broader market sentiment that might eventually trickle down to crypto. Diversify your portfolio and consider how various economic scenarios might affect your digital asset holdings. Conclusion: An Evolving Global Economic Landscape The forthcoming July 9 Announcement from President Trump regarding trade decisions is more than just a news item; it’s a critical moment that could redefine Global Trade for years to come. With at least seven countries initially in focus, and more to follow, the implications for Economic Impact , Trade Relations , and the overall financial landscape are substantial. Businesses, governments, and investors, including those deeply invested in the crypto space, must pay close attention. The unfolding Trump Trade Policy will undoubtedly present both formidable challenges and unique opportunities, underscoring the interconnectedness of our global economy. Being prepared and understanding these shifts will be paramount for navigating the path ahead.

As crypto bulls charge into Q3, one new altcoin is making serious noise, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Phase 5 Mutuum Finance presale surpasses 60% sold out at $0.03. Presale has raised more than $11.9 million and onboarded more than 12,900 unique holders. This is as low as MUTM will ever be priced and is exploding onto the scene with low-price potential and high-utility hype that could turn early investors into whales. While Ethereum (ETH) and other heavyweights hold steady in the background, smart money is hunting for what to buy in July, and all signs point to Mutuum Finance leading the charge. Ethereum at a Crossroads: Poised for Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is trading at about $2,517, up after it traded at the range of $2,490 and $2,528 in the past 24 hours. In the last seven days, ETH has been stranded in a narrow range with evidence of consolidation as traders await a breakout. Analysts consider the breakthrough of $2,560 as an important resistance level, any movements beyond that might initiate some upward movement, though the support at the level of $2,480 is also sustaining the market. On-chain activity follows as well, and the transaction volume and the number of users, on average, are increasing in the network. Recent Pectra upgrade and current dominance of Ethereum of DeFi and Layer-2 systems continue to make it the central focus of the crypto infrastructure. As ETH remains a long game, the newer altcoin options such as MUTM are drawing the interest of those who do not regard the majors. Fueling the Future: Phase 5 of Mutuum Finance Presale is Live Mutuum Finance is gaining traction during Phase 5 of the presale. The project stands out from other projects since it does not rely on hype but has actual use case in real life. Investor interest is growing with the project already going past more than $11.9 million and having over 12,900 token holders. Mutuum Finance features a non-custodial liquidity protocol which allows users to maintain their full ownership of assets. The project involves a double-model strategy that involves the use of Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending to ensure greater flexibility as well as efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system uses smart contracts to provide automatic lending with no human involvement and instead the smart contracts respond to the market by offering variable interest rates. Through the application of this auto mechanism, the borrowers’ and lenders’ world gets stabilized and made predictable. Peer-to-Peer model lacks middlemen and thus a direct relationship between borrowers and lenders is offered. Mutuum Introduces Its Own USD Stablecoin, A New Era Begins Mutuum Finance is developing a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The stablecoin would be market-volatility-resistant and depeg risk-resistant algorithmic stablecoins. Leading blockchain security company, CertiK, has also audited the project’s smart contracts. In addition to putting investors at ease about the code base’s integrity and transparency, the conducted audit shows that the project believes in building a secure DeFi protocol. To make this guarantee tangible, the project has launched a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. The bounty runs on four levels of vulnerabilities, that is, critical, major, minor and low. With its unique leaderboard system the top 50 Mutuum Finance holders are rewarded. Holders who maintain top 50 rank will receive rewards in bonus tokens. The system encourages excitement as well as loyalty, and ecosystem growth overdrive. Ethereum remains a solid long-term play, but Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is stealing the spotlight right now. With over $11.9 million raised, 12,900+ holders, and Phase 5 already 60% sold out at $0.03, this is the lowest price MUTM will ever be. Buy now before prices rise.

A significant development recently emerged from South Korea, signaling a profound shift: major players, including Woori Bank , one of the nation’s largest financial institutions, alongside gaming giant Wemade, tech innovator Tscientific, and blockchain infrastructure provider DSRV, have reportedly filed trademark applications for stablecoin names. This move isn’t just a ripple; it’s a powerful wave indicating a growing institutional embrace of Korean stablecoins and the broader digital asset ecosystem in the region. Why Are These Korean Firms Eyeing Stablecoins? This coordinated push into stablecoins by such diverse entities highlights a strategic foresight. Stablecoins, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar or a basket of assets. Their stability makes them ideal for everyday transactions, remittances, and as a bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized world. For these Korean firms , entering the stablecoin arena presents multiple opportunities: Woori Bank: As a pillar of traditional finance, Woori Bank’s interest signals a clear intent to modernize its services, explore new revenue streams in the digital economy, and potentially offer more efficient cross-border payments or digital payment solutions to its vast customer base. This move could position them at the forefront of digital banking innovation. Wemade: A prominent gaming company, Wemade is deeply invested in the Web3 space, particularly with its Wemix blockchain platform. A stablecoin would seamlessly integrate into their gaming ecosystem, facilitating in-game economies, NFT marketplaces, and user transactions with unprecedented stability and efficiency. Tscientific: As a tech company, Tscientific’s involvement suggests a focus on the underlying technological infrastructure or the development of specific applications that leverage stablecoins. They could be building platforms for payments, decentralized finance (DeFi), or other innovative services. DSRV: A blockchain infrastructure provider, DSRV’s role is crucial. They are likely involved in providing the core technology, security, and network stability required for these stablecoins to operate effectively and securely. Their participation underscores the foundational technical expertise needed for such ventures. Understanding the Significance for Digital Assets in South Korea The entry of these major players into the stablecoin space is a game-changer for the landscape of digital assets South Korea . It signifies a maturation of the market and a growing acceptance of blockchain technology beyond speculative trading. Here’s what it means: Entity Primary Focus Potential Stablecoin Role Woori Bank Traditional Banking, Financial Services Digital payments, cross-border remittances, corporate treasury management Wemade Gaming, Web3 Ecosystems In-game currencies, NFT marketplace transactions, user rewards Tscientific Technology Solutions, Innovation Platform development, integration services, specialized applications DSRV Blockchain Infrastructure, Node Operation Underlying network security, transaction processing, technical support This multi-sector engagement underscores a broader strategy to embed blockchain technology into various facets of the economy, moving beyond speculative investments towards practical, everyday utility. It could pave the way for more institutional capital to flow into the space, fostering innovation and creating new job opportunities. How Will Blockchain Adoption Benefit the Korean Economy? The accelerated blockchain adoption , spearheaded by these stablecoin initiatives, promises a multitude of benefits for the Korean economy: Enhanced Financial Efficiency: Stablecoins can significantly reduce transaction costs and processing times for payments and remittances, making financial services more accessible and affordable. Innovation Hub: By embracing stablecoins, South Korea strengthens its position as a global leader in technological innovation, attracting more blockchain developers, startups, and foreign investment. New Business Models: Stablecoins enable novel business models in areas like DeFi, Web3 gaming, supply chain finance, and digital content creation, opening up entirely new markets. Financial Inclusion: For segments of the population that are underserved by traditional banking, stablecoins could offer a more inclusive pathway to financial services, especially when integrated with mobile platforms. Global Competitiveness: As countries worldwide explore digital currencies, South Korea’s proactive stance with private stablecoins keeps it competitive on the global stage, potentially influencing international standards and practices. This widespread adoption is not just about technology; it’s about building a more robust, efficient, and interconnected digital economy. What About Stablecoin Regulations in South Korea? The filings by Woori Bank and others come at a crucial time for stablecoin regulations in South Korea. The nation has been actively working on a comprehensive framework for digital assets. The Financial Services Commission (FSC) has been particularly focused on establishing clear guidelines for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and ensuring investor protection. While the exact regulatory treatment for these new stablecoins will depend on their specific design and use cases (e.g., whether they are payment tokens, security tokens, or utility tokens), the very act of filing trademarks suggests these firms are confident in navigating the evolving regulatory landscape or are perhaps even anticipating favorable policies. Key aspects of the ongoing regulatory discussions include: Clarity on Issuance: Who can issue stablecoins and under what conditions? Reserve Requirements: How will stablecoins be backed, and will their reserves be regularly audited? Consumer Protection: Measures to safeguard users against risks like insolvency or market manipulation. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF): Ensuring stablecoin transactions adhere to global financial integrity standards. The proactive engagement from traditional banks and large corporations could also provide valuable input to regulators, helping to shape a framework that is both secure and conducive to innovation. The Road Ahead: Challenges and Opportunities for Korean Stablecoins While the outlook for Korean stablecoins appears promising, the journey won’t be without its challenges. These include: Regulatory Nuances: Even with progress, interpreting and complying with new regulations can be complex, especially as stablecoin models diversify. Technological Scalability: Ensuring the underlying blockchain infrastructure can handle high transaction volumes securely and efficiently. Interoperability: The ability for different stablecoins and blockchain networks to communicate and transact seamlessly. Market Acceptance: Convincing the broader public and businesses to adopt stablecoins for everyday use, which requires education and trust-building. Competition: Both from other private stablecoins globally and potentially from a future central bank digital currency (CBDC) if South Korea decides to issue one. However, these challenges also present significant opportunities for innovation. The firms involved are likely to invest heavily in research and development, security protocols, and user-friendly interfaces to overcome these hurdles, ultimately benefiting the entire ecosystem. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Finance in South Korea The trademark applications filed by Woori Bank, Wemade, Tscientific, and DSRV mark a pivotal moment for South Korea’s digital asset journey. It signifies a clear intent from established players to not just observe but actively participate in shaping the future of finance. The potential for Korean stablecoins to revolutionize payments, enhance financial services, and drive broader blockchain adoption is immense. As stablecoin regulations continue to evolve, and more firms embrace this technology, South Korea is poised to become a leading hub for digital financial innovation, setting a compelling precedent for other nations to follow.

Only a week after launching its blockchain-based trading service in the EU, CEO Vlad Tenev says private companies are lining up to join. These firms want to offer blockchain-based versions of their shares, aiming to reach everyday investors in a new way. Tenev described the reaction as a “flood” of interest , with companies seeing blockchain as a gateway to wider capital markets. The platform now offers over 200 tokenized U.S. stocks , along with promotional tokens for well-known private companies like SpaceX and OpenAI. These promotional tokens aren’t tradable yet, but they hint at Robinhood’s bigger vision. The company wants to bring thousands of private firms onto the platform, especially as many startups are choosing to stay private longer. Tenev sees this as a way to improve capital access for smaller investors. Still, the project has caught the eye of regulators. Lithuania’s central bank has asked Robinhood to explain how the tokens work. The company says it’s ready to cooperate and believes the platform meets EU regulatory standards. The tokens are considered both MiCA and MiFID compliant and are backed by actual U.S. stocks held by brokers. Robinhood hasn’t rolled out the platform in the U.S. or U.K. yet but is already in talks with regulators. Tenev is confident that current U.S. laws are flexible enough and pointed out that even the SEC is now exploring tokenized assets. This launch comes as more institutions look to blockchain for financial innovation. BioSig Technologies just raised $1.1 billion to tokenize commodities, and Dubai’s QCD fund became the first of its kind in its region to get approval. With rising interest from both companies and regulators, Robinhood is placing itself at the heart of the shift toward turning traditional shares into blockchain-based assets.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-07-09 07:32:51
47867537,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=403338,1752046465,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/47867537.jpeg,This Overlooked Binance Metric Might Predict Bitcoin’s Next Major Move,https://cryptopotato.com/this-overlooked-binance-metric-might-predict-bitcoins-next-major-move/,"Bitcoin has mostly traded between $105,000 and $110,000 this month, hovering near its all-time high. Yet on Binance, perpetual futures prices continue to lag behind spot prices. The continued negative Spot-Perpetual Price Delta on Binance since December 2024 reveals a structural imbalance. Spot Leads, Futures Lags In its latest analysis, CryptoQuant explained that this negative delta indicates the spot price of Bitcoin has consistently traded above perpetual futures prices. This means that the current rally is being driven largely by spot buyers rather than leveraged futures traders on Binance. When the delta initially flipped from positive to negative in December, Bitcoin reached its then-all-time high, with aggressive long positioning on Binance’s perpetual markets, while the spot price trailed. Even after BTC’s decline to $74,000 and subsequent recovery to a new peak, the delta has remained negative. Such a trend highlights that perpetual markets are still not fully participating in the upside momentum. This behavior could reflect a cautious environment among leveraged traders, which could mean that the market is in an accumulation phase where supply is absorbed gradually by spot buyers before a potential continuation of the rally. Importantly, the current structure implies a healthier rally as it is not being driven by excessive leverage, which reduces the risk of sharp liquidations that can destabilize the price. However, a flip in the delta from negative to positive would signal an influx of leveraged longs, as it is often a precursor to local tops or corrections, since liquidity becomes an attractive target for market makers and whales. As such, while spot demand remains strong, the market’s next phase will likely be defined by how and when Binance’s perpetual markets catch up, with the delta acting as a key signal for potential volatility ahead. Accumulation by Institutions Against this backdrop of spot-driven strength on Binance, Bitfinex Alpha’s latest report revealed that bulls are maintaining structural control. Bitcoin has defended the short-term holders’ realized price of $98,220, hinting at constructive bullish momentum even amid volatility. The rising STH cost basis near $99,474 indicates continued accumulation by newer participants. This includes institutions via ETFs. Meanwhile, whales are distributing holdings and have offloaded over 14,000 BTC since June 30, while retail and institutions absorb supply, thereby driving momentum amid macro uncertainty and equity market strength.

Cronos ( CRO ) surged over 20% on Tuesday after Trump Media and Technology Group filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a Blue Chip ETF that includes CRO alongside Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and Ripple ( XRP ). Notably, Cronos received a 5% allocation, which is more than Ripple’s 2%. If approved, the ETF will be listed on NYSE Arca and its assets will be custodied by Foris DAX Trust Company, Crypto.com’s custody arm. The news sparked a sharp breakout, sending CRO price from its July 8 open at $0.081 to an intraday high of $0.10, breaking above a descending trendline and out of the recent consolidation range. The rally pushed the price through key moving averages and briefly tested a previous swing-high resistance. It also approached the 200-day SMA, now acting as its dynamic resistance. As of now, CRO price has pulled back slightly, trading around $0.092, just above the horizontal support near $0.089–0.090. This area, which previously acted as resistance in late April – early May, is now being retested as support following the breakout. Holding this level would be bullish, confirming a successful retest and setting up for a potential move back toward the $0.101 (200-day SMA) and $0.105 resistance zone.

These bullish catalysts may offer a much-needed respite for CRO holders, following a major blow in March when Cronos voted to reissue 70 billion previously burned CRO tokens.

Key Takeaways: Polymarket ruled “No” on whether Zelenskyy wore a suit, sparking backlash. Traders criticized the decision despite media and photo evidence suggesting he did. This marks the second suit-related controversy involving Zelenskyy on Polymarket. The market, which drew over $237 million in trading volume, became one of the platform’s most active this year. It asked whether Zelenskyy would be “photographed or videotaped wearing a suit” between March 22 and June 30. Zelenskyy Sparks Buzz by Ditching Signature Military Look at NATO Event Zelenskyy was widely reported to have worn what many described as a suit during a June 24 NATO event in the Netherlands. However, the decentralized oracle operated by UMA ruled the evidence insufficient, citing a lack of “consensus of credible reporting.” Initially resolved as “Yes,” the contract outcome was reversed after a challenge, with a second review ultimately locking in the “No” result on Tuesday evening. The ruling sparked backlash from traders and commentators, some accusing the protocol of inconsistency and poor governance. Critics pointed to multiple press reports and visual footage that clearly showed Zelenskyy in a black jacket, collared shirt, and matching trousers—an ensemble many argued met the criteria. Others noted that a similar outfit worn by Zelenskyy in a previous market had also been ruled as not qualifying as a suit, suggesting the rejection was in line with precedent. Still, the reaction was heated. Martin Shkreli, a polarizing figure in the crypto space, livestreamed his frustration on July 1, labeling the resolution process a “scam” and threatening to raise the issue with Polymarket’s backers. The controversy spilled into rival platforms, with traders on Myriad Markets launching bets on how Polymarket’s oracle would rule. Prominent menswear commentator Derek Guy added fuel to the fire , quipping on June 26 that the outfit was “both a suit and not a suit.” This is not the first time Zelenskyy’s wardrobe has triggered a betting uproar on Polymarket. A similar dispute erupted in May over whether his outfit during a German meeting counted as a suit. That market ultimately ruled “no,” despite Derek Guy asserting the matching cloth made it technically a suit. Polymarket Nears Unicorn Status With $200M Raise As reported, Polymarket is close to securing a $200 million funding round led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, valuing the crypto-based prediction platform at $1 billion. Despite being banned in the U.S. and raided by the FBI last year , Polymarket’s user base and market activity have surged, with over 21,000 open markets and $700 million in active trading volume. The platform recently partnered with Elon Musk’s X to integrate prediction markets with Grok, X’s AI chatbot, boosting its visibility amid ongoing regulatory hurdles. Polymarket has seen explosive growth since the 2024 U.S. election, hitting a $2.5 billion trading peak in November, but it remains restricted in several countries and faces criticism over potential market manipulation.

The official agenda mentions “enforcement matters,” prompting hopes that this could mark a significant development, possibly even the end of the SEC’s appeal against Ripple Labs. While nothing has been confirmed, the crypto community is watching closely. A decision to withdraw the appeal could drastically affect XRP’s legal standing and market price, potentially ending years of legal uncertainty. Are Legal Experts Warning Against Getting Too Excited? Former SEC lawyer Marc Fagel has thrown cold water on the excitement. He reminded followers that such closed-door meetings are often routine and rarely involve major announcements, especially over the weekend. “The SEC isn’t in the office on Saturdays,” he emphasized on X , addressing rumors that a weekend decision could be imminent. Is a Saturday Appeal Withdrawal Even Possible? Despite the skepticism, some users argue that it is legally possible for the SEC to withdraw its appeal on a Saturday. One user, unknowDLT , pointed this out and even noted that ChatGPT confirmed this possibility. Could XRP Be Tied to a Larger Financial Shift? The XRP community remains hopeful. One crypto user speculated that if the Ripple case concludes soon, it might align with broader financial infrastructure upgrades—specifically, Fedwire’s move to a Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)-based system and adoption of ISO 20022. “The price of XRP will be impacted and will FLY to prices we cannot understand now,” the user claimed. Will a Ripple Lawsuit Dismissal Usher in a New Financial Era? Another X user, Jazzy Q, believes that Fedwire’s upgraded system will go live on July 14, with all components activated by midnight this Friday. He speculates that the Ripple lawsuit will be dropped on Saturday, potentially triggering a market crash. According to him, Monday could mark the beginning of an entirely new financial system. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why XRP Price is Not Surging? , What Happens If the SEC Stays Silent?

As anticipation builds, the crypto world is laser-focused on the SEC’s July 10 meeting. Whether it brings a legal breakthrough or proves to be just another routine discussion, it could offer valuable clues about the future of XRP and Ripple’s long-standing regulatory battle. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , a popular barometer for understanding market psychology, has recently climbed to a significant 66, firmly planting itself in the ‘Greed’ zone. This upward movement, up one point from the previous day as of July 9, suggests a palpable shift in crypto market sentiment . But what exactly does this number tell us, and how should investors interpret this wave of optimism? Decoding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: What Does it Measure? At its core, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index aims to distill the complex emotions driving the cryptocurrency market into a single, digestible number. Developed by Alternative, a software development platform, this index ranges from 0 to 100. A score of 0 screams “extreme fear,” often indicating potential buying opportunities as investors panic sell. Conversely, a score of 100 shouts “extreme greed,” which might signal an impending correction as the market becomes overbought. The current reading of 66 sits squarely in the ‘Greed’ territory, suggesting that optimism, and perhaps a touch of irrational exuberance, is currently prevalent among participants. How is Investor Sentiment Calculated? A Look at Key Factors Understanding how the index arrives at its score is crucial for any investor seeking to gauge investor sentiment accurately. The index doesn’t rely on a single metric but rather a blend of six distinct factors, each weighted to contribute to the final reading. These factors provide a holistic view of the market’s psychological state: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin compared to its average over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear, while stable markets can foster greed. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum, comparing it to the last 30 and 90-day averages. High buying volumes and strong momentum typically indicate a greedy market. Social Media (15%): The index scans Twitter hashtags and Reddit posts for crypto-related terms, analyzing the speed and number of posts. A surge in positive sentiment or overly optimistic discussions can push the index towards greed. Surveys (15%): This component, though currently paused, involves polling a large group of crypto investors weekly to gather their direct sentiment about the market. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Bitcoin dominance refers to Bitcoin’s market cap share relative to the total crypto market cap. A rising dominance often suggests investors are moving into Bitcoin, perceived as a safer asset, which can indicate fear in altcoins. Conversely, falling dominance can signal a risk-on environment where altcoins are gaining traction, often associated with greed. Google Trends (10%): This factor analyzes Google search queries related to cryptocurrencies. A spike in searches for “Bitcoin price manipulation” or “crypto crash” might indicate fear, while searches for “how to buy Bitcoin” during a bull run could signal greed. Navigating the ‘Greed’ Zone: What Does High Crypto Market Sentiment Mean for You? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hovers in the ‘Greed’ zone, as it is now at 66, it suggests that investors are generally optimistic and perhaps becoming overconfident. Historically, periods of extreme greed can precede market corrections, as assets become overvalued. However, it’s also true that bull runs can extend for significant periods, with the index remaining in ‘Greed’ for weeks or even months. This elevated crypto market sentiment indicates that many are expecting further price appreciation. For investors, this current reading presents both opportunities and risks. On one hand, strong positive sentiment can fuel continued upward price action, especially for Bitcoin and major altcoins. On the other hand, it’s a time for caution. The adage “be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful” often rings true in crypto. While not a precise timing tool, a high ‘Greed’ score serves as a reminder to reassess your portfolio, consider profit-taking on over-extended assets, and avoid impulsive decisions driven by FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Understanding Market Volatility: A Constant Companion in Crypto One of the most significant factors influencing the index is market volatility . The crypto market is notorious for its rapid price swings, and these movements directly impact the ‘Volatility’ component of the index. High volatility can stem from various sources: macroeconomic news, regulatory announcements, major hacks, or even large institutional buys/sells. When the market experiences sharp, unpredictable movements, it often triggers fear, pushing the index lower. Conversely, a period of relatively stable upward movement, even if prices are rising, might contribute to a sense of calm optimism that translates into greed. Staying informed about the causes of volatility can help you better anticipate shifts in the index and overall market sentiment. The Strategic Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Market Dynamics The Bitcoin dominance metric, though only 10% of the index’s weighting, plays a strategic role in reflecting broader market dynamics. When Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap increases, it often indicates that investors are seeking refuge in what they perceive as the most secure and established cryptocurrency. This flight to safety usually happens during periods of uncertainty or fear, as capital flows out of riskier altcoins. Conversely, when Bitcoin dominance declines, it often signals a “altcoin season,” where capital flows from Bitcoin into various altcoins, driven by higher risk appetite and the pursuit of greater returns. This shift is typically associated with a greedy market, as investors become more confident in exploring higher-risk, higher-reward opportunities across the altcoin spectrum. Conclusion: Navigating the Market with Informed Investor Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index at 66, firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone, is a clear indicator of prevailing optimism in the crypto market. While it’s not a crystal ball for future prices, it offers invaluable insights into collective investor sentiment . By understanding its components—from market volatility and momentum to social media trends and Bitcoin dominance —investors can gain a more nuanced perspective beyond just price charts. This index serves as a powerful reminder to approach the market with a balanced perspective, leveraging periods of heightened greed for strategic re-evaluation and ensuring you’re not swept away by emotional trading. Use this tool as part of a broader analytical framework to make more informed and rational investment decisions in the dynamic world of digital assets.

Song enabled strategies for IT workers to obtain jobs at firms by utilizing fictitious identities. Furthermore, OFAC sanctioned one person and four companies engaged in Russian scams. The DPRK’s military projects and financial operations are the targets of the actions. Song Kum Hyok targeted for facilitating fraudulent employment schemes Song Kum Hyok is a DPRK cyber actor who is associated with the sanctioned Andariel hacking group. The actor oversaw information technology employee cons that recruited DPRK nationals in Russia and China. Song provided the workers with false identities and nationalities to work for firms. The program took advantage of innocent businesses to make money for the DPRK government by fraudulent means. DPRK IT personnel occasionally infected business networks with malware for later exploitation. The personnel actively concealed their names, locations, and nationalities by using pseudonyms and supporting documents. In 2022 and 2023, Song used US persons’ information including names and social security numbers. The cyber actor created aliases for hired foreign workers using stolen personal data. Workers then used these accounts to pose as US persons seeking remote employment. Song planned to split income generated from these fraudulent employment arrangements with the workers. The scheme targeted employers in wealthier countries through mainstream freelance contracting and payment platforms. Applications developed by DPRK IT workers spanned business, health, fitness, social networking, and entertainment sectors. As per the press release details , DPRK maintains thousands of highly skilled IT workers globally, primarily located in China and Russia. These workers generate revenue that contributes to the regime’s weapons of mass destruction programs. The workers often take projects involving virtual currency and use crypto exchanges for fund management. Song faces designation under Executive Order 13694 for receiving funds through cyber-enabled means. The designation targets commercial advantage and private financial gain from misappropriated information and resources. Russian network contracts North Korean IT workers directly Gayk Asatryan is a Russian citizen who contracts North Korean IT personnel through Russian-based businesses. Asatryan and Korea Songkwang Trading General Corporation inked a 10-year agreement in the middle of 2024. The agreement allows dispatch of up to 30 DPRK IT workers to Russia for Asatryan Limited Liability Company. Asatryan also contracted with Korea Saenal Trading Corporation for additional worker deployment arrangements. According to the second deal, Fortuna Limited Liability Company would send 50 DPRK IT specialists to Russia. Both companies operate under Asatryan’s control to facilitate the worker placement schemes. OFAC designated Asatryan under Executive Order 13722 for attempting to export workers from North Korea. The designation targets revenue generation for the Government of North Korea and Workers’ Party. Asatryan LLC and Fortuna LLC face sanctions for being owned or controlled by Asatryan. Korea Songkwang Trading General Corporation received designation under Executive Order 13810 as North Korean persons. Korea Saenal Trading Corporation also faces sanctions for engaging in commercial activity generating regime revenue. Both DPRK companies facilitate the overseas deployment of IT workers through contractual arrangements. The network operates across multiple jurisdictions to obscure the true nature of employment relationships. Russian companies provide legal frameworks for DPRK worker deployment while maintaining plausible deniability. The arrangement allows North Korean workers to access international markets through Russian business entities. These contracts formalize what previously operated as informal worker placement schemes across international borders. The structured approach indicates increased sophistication in DPRK revenue generation efforts through legitimate business channels. Treasury targets revenue streams for weapons development programs The sanctions action is part of the US government efforts to counter DPRK strategic interests through cyber espionage. Deputy Secretary Michael Faulkender highlighted the importance of remaining vigilant against DPRK financing of weapons programs. US Treasury is dedicated to stopping attempts by the Kim dictatorship to use digital asset theft as a means of evading sanctions. The Lazarus Group, Bluenoroff, and Andariel were previously sanctioned by OFAC on September 13, 2019. The DPRK state-sponsored cyber groups are under the Reconnaissance General Bureau planning virtual currency thefts. The groups had masterminded numerous high-value cryptocurrency heists to mitigate US and multilateral sanctions impacts. The Technical Reconnaissance Bureau was sanctioned on May 23, 2023 for the development of offensive cyber capabilities. Its sub-unit cyber organization, the 110th Research Center, is also sanctioned for assisting DPRK activities. United Nations Security Council Resolution 2270 sanctioned the RGB in March 2016 for assistance in weapons development. All property and interests of blocked persons held in US custody must be blocked. Entities controlled by 50% or more of the blacklisted individuals are likewise blocked. US citizens are required by law to notify OFAC of any banned property. OFAC rules bar US persons from engaging in any transaction with blocked persons unless authorized properly. Offenses of sanctions by US persons can be criminal or civil in nature for foreign or domestic persons. Banks may face sanctions for transactions with listed persons. The end objective is centered on the delivery of positive behavioral adjustment instead of punishment. OFAC is empowered to delist individuals from the Specially Designated Nationals List as necessary. Integrity in sanctions stems from designation and delisting power under existing legal frameworks.

According to an indictment unsealed on Monday, co-founders Michael Shannon Sims and Juan Carlos Reynoso launched the fake investment platform in 2019, ran the scheme for several years, and pulled in more than $650 million before it collapsed. Called OmegaPro, the platform promised investors up to 300% returns in 16 months, claiming elite traders were generating profits through forex markets. The funds were collected in crypto, moved through wallets controlled by insiders, and then quietly paid out to top promoters. To make the project appear legitimate and attract new investors, Sims and Reynoso held flashy events across Latin America, Europe, and the U.S. The pair promoted OmegaPro on social media with luxury cars and designer brands, and even projected the company’s logo onto the Burj Khalifa.

Victims were told their funds were being moved to a new platform called Broker Group as part of restructuring efforts. In reality, withdrawals were cut off, and users lost access to their money on both platforms. Both men are now facing charges of wire fraud and money laundering, with a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison each if convicted. The case, which marks one of the largest crypto fraud indictments in recent years, comes as global financial authorities step up efforts to shut down digital asset scams. Just last week, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority secured a combined 12-year prison sentence for two men behind a similar fraudulent scheme. In that case, the founders promoted fake crypto investment services, exploiting trust and bypassing regulatory safeguards. The scheme resulted in losses of about £1.5 million across multiple victims. Commenting on the OmegaPro crackdown, the head of the U.S. Justice Department’s Criminal Division said authorities will continue going after crypto fraud schemes that prey on investors. “We are leading efforts to combat these complex and insidious digital asset investor scams,” he said, adding that prosecutors remain committed to “pursuing justice for their many victims.” You might also like: DOJ credits Tether for aiding funds recovery from Trump-linked crypto scam",News|Crypto Scam|DOJ,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|USDT,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-07-09 07:40:29

According to data from crypto.news, Cardano ( ADA ) was trading at $0.58, marking a 6.6% gain over the past week that pushed its market cap over $21 billion. Despite this, the broader picture remains mixed with ADA still down 11.9% over the past 30 days and trading nearly 50% below its $1 peak from March 3. While bulls have attempted to revisit that level multiple times since, each effort has ultimately fallen short. Some market analysts view July as a potential turning point. With bullish sentiment slowly returning across the broader crypto market heading into Q3, attention has shifted to $0.70 as the next major resistance level. A successful breakout above that zone could open the door to a renewed push toward $1, particularly if macro conditions and liquidity flows continue to improve. One notable catalyst that could support renewed investor interest is Cardano’s expansion efforts beyond its traditional DeFi and staking focus. On July 8, the Cardano Foundation announced Reeve, a new enterprise-grade financial reporting platform built on the Cardano blockchain. Reeve allows institutions to publish tamper-proof financial data directly on-chain, offering a transparent and audit-ready solution that integrates with existing accounting systems. Such enterprise-focused developments could strengthen Cardano’s fundamental narrative, especially among institutional allocators eyeing scalable blockchain infrastructure.

ADA price, MACD and RSI chart — July 9 | Source: crypto.news Supporting this outlook, momentum indicators such as MACD and RSI have both begun to trend upward, signaling a gradual shift in sentiment from selling to buying pressure. A confirmed breakout above the upper band of the wedge at $0.6053 would be the first bullish trigger. Should this occur, $0.73 emerges as the next key resistance, which represents a 25.8% upside from current levels. Still, this optimistic scenario hinges on ADA maintaining its critical support level at $0.54. A breakdown below this level could negate the bullish setup entirely. However, not all indicators are in the bulls’ favor. Whale wallets have reportedly offloaded over 170 million ADA in the past two weeks, according to data from Santiment, a move suggesting reduced confidence among large holders. This kind of smart money outflow typically indicates expectations of short-term weakness and may continue to act as a headwind for any short-term rally. Hence, unless bulls manage to reclaim control and flip $0.73 into support, a sustainable move toward $1 in the short term remains unlikely. Conversely, if ADA loses its grip on the $0.54 support zone, it could trigger a deeper pullback to $0.50 or even retest the wedge base near $0.44, where stronger buyer interest may eventually return.

This development, announced via a Business Wire press release, marks a pivotal moment for traditional financial institutions venturing into the world of digital assets. The initiative was brought to fruition through strategic collaborations with Balance, a leading BTC custodian, and Bull Bitcoin, an API provider known for its robust cryptocurrency solutions. This strategic integration by a Canadian credit union is not just a technological upgrade; it’s a bold statement about the future of finance, blending the reliability of conventional banking with the innovation of cryptocurrency. What Does This Revolutionary Bitcoin Service Entail? The core of BVCU’s new offering is its “Bitcoin Gateway,” a seamless integration that allows members to interact with Bitcoin without leaving their familiar banking environment. Traditionally, purchasing Bitcoin involved navigating third-party exchanges, often requiring separate accounts, verification processes, and transfers between banks and crypto platforms. BVCU’s solution simplifies this significantly, offering unparalleled convenience and security. Direct Account Access: Members can initiate Bitcoin purchases directly from their BVCU accounts, treating BTC much like any other investment product or currency exchange. Canadian Dollar Transactions: All transactions are conducted in Canadian dollars, eliminating the need for foreign exchange conversions often associated with international crypto platforms. Enhanced Security: By partnering with Balance, a regulated and trusted Bitcoin custodian, BVCU ensures that members’ digital assets are held securely, mitigating risks often associated with self-custody or less regulated exchanges. Simplified User Experience: The goal is to make acquiring Bitcoin as straightforward as paying a bill or transferring funds online, removing common barriers to entry for new crypto users. This initiative represents a significant step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies, especially for those who have been hesitant due to perceived complexities or security concerns. For a Bow Valley Credit Union member, it means embracing the future of finance with the confidence that their institution is leading the way. Why Is This a Game Changer for Canadian Credit Unions and Crypto Banking? BVCU’s pioneering move carries profound implications for the broader financial sector in Canada and beyond. It challenges the traditional reluctance of banks and credit unions to engage with cryptocurrencies, setting a precedent for how established financial institutions can adapt to the digital asset revolution. For Canadian credit unions, this opens a new frontier: First-Mover Advantage: BVCU has positioned itself as an innovator, potentially attracting new members who are keen on crypto but prefer the security and familiarity of a regulated financial institution. Meeting Member Demand: As interest in Bitcoin grows, credit unions face increasing pressure to offer relevant services. BVCU is directly addressing this demand, preventing members from seeking these services elsewhere. Regulatory Clarity: By working with partners like Balance and Bull Bitcoin, BVCU is navigating the complex regulatory landscape for crypto banking, potentially paving a clearer path for others to follow. Diversification of Services: Integrating Bitcoin allows credit unions to expand their service offerings, moving beyond traditional loans and deposits into the burgeoning digital asset space. This initiative demonstrates that traditional finance and digital assets are not mutually exclusive but can indeed converge to create a more comprehensive and user-friendly financial ecosystem. It’s a testament to the forward-thinking approach of Bow Valley Credit Union. Seamlessly Buy Bitcoin Canada: Benefits for Members The primary beneficiaries of BVCU’s new Bitcoin Gateway are its members. The service addresses several pain points associated with cryptocurrency acquisition, making it more accessible and secure for the average Canadian. Here’s how members stand to benefit: Unprecedented Convenience: No more linking external bank accounts to crypto exchanges or waiting for interbank transfers. The entire process to buy Bitcoin Canada is integrated within their existing banking interface. Enhanced Security and Trust: Members are dealing directly with their trusted credit union, which in turn partners with regulated entities like Balance for custody. This significantly reduces the risk of scams, hacks, or mismanaged funds often associated with less reputable platforms. Simplified Compliance: The credit union handles much of the regulatory compliance (KYC/AML), ensuring that transactions adhere to Canadian financial laws without burdening the individual member with complex procedures. Financial Inclusion: For individuals who might find standalone crypto exchanges intimidating, this integrated service provides a familiar and safe entry point into the digital asset economy. Access to Financial Innovation: Members can participate in the growing digital asset market, potentially diversifying their portfolios and exploring new investment opportunities with the backing of their financial institution. This strategic move by Bow Valley Credit Union is a clear signal that mainstream finance is ready to embrace the future, making it easier for Canadians to participate in the global Bitcoin economy. Challenges and Opportunities for Mainstream Crypto Banking Adoption While BVCU’s move is commendable, the path to widespread crypto banking integration is not without its challenges. These include regulatory hurdles, technological complexities, and the need for significant customer education. Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: Despite recent clarifications, the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains dynamic. Financial institutions must continuously adapt to evolving rules and guidelines. Technological Integration: Seamlessly integrating blockchain technology with legacy banking systems is a complex undertaking, requiring robust APIs, secure data management, and continuous maintenance. Security Risks: While BVCU mitigates this through a trusted custodian, managing digital assets inherently carries unique security risks, including cyberattacks and sophisticated scams. Customer Education: Many traditional banking customers may lack understanding of Bitcoin and its volatility. Credit unions must invest in educating their members to ensure responsible engagement. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility can be a concern for conservative financial institutions and their members. Managing expectations and providing clear disclaimers are crucial. Opportunities: New Revenue Streams: Offering crypto services can unlock new fee-based revenue streams for credit unions. Competitive Differentiation: Being an early adopter provides a significant competitive edge, attracting tech-savvy younger demographics and existing members seeking modern financial solutions. Innovation Leadership: Institutions that embrace crypto position themselves as leaders in financial innovation, enhancing their brand reputation. Future-Proofing: As digital assets become more integral to the global economy, integrating them now prepares financial institutions for the future of finance. The decision by this Canadian credit union highlights a willingness to navigate these challenges for the immense opportunities that lie ahead in the realm of Bitcoin services. The Broader Landscape: Will Other Canadian Credit Unions Follow BVCU’s Lead? BVCU’s initiative sets a powerful precedent. The question now is whether other financial institutions, particularly other Canadian credit unions and even major banks, will follow suit. The pressure to innovate and cater to evolving customer demands is mounting. Several factors could influence this: Regulatory Comfort: As regulators provide clearer guidelines, more institutions will feel comfortable entering the space. Technological Partnerships: The availability of reliable and secure third-party solutions, like those provided by Balance and Bull Bitcoin, makes integration more feasible. Customer Demand: Increasing member inquiries and the desire to buy Bitcoin Canada easily will push institutions to act. Competitive Pressure: No financial institution wants to be left behind while competitors capture new market segments. This pioneering step by Bow Valley Credit Union could well be the spark that ignites a broader trend, making integrated crypto banking a standard offering across Canada’s financial sector. Actionable Insights: What This Means for You and the Future of Finance For individuals and institutions alike, BVCU’s Bitcoin Gateway offers valuable insights and potential pathways forward. For Individual Members: Explore the Service: If you are a BVCU member interested in Bitcoin, take advantage of this convenient and secure service to buy Bitcoin Canada. Educate Yourself: Even with simplified access, understanding Bitcoin’s fundamentals, risks, and potential rewards is crucial. Start Small: Consider starting with smaller amounts to get comfortable with the process and market dynamics. For Other Financial Institutions: Assess Demand: Gauge your members’ interest in cryptocurrency services. Research Partnerships: Explore collaborations with established crypto custodians and API providers to leverage their expertise and infrastructure for a secure Bitcoin service. Engage with Regulators: Proactively work with regulatory bodies to understand compliance requirements and contribute to shaping future policies for crypto banking. Prioritize Security: Any venture into crypto must put robust security measures and reliable custody solutions at the forefront. The move by Bow Valley Credit Union is a blueprint for how traditional finance can embrace innovation responsibly. The Future is Here: Bridging Traditional and Digital Finance The launch of BVCU’s Bitcoin Gateway is more than just a new product offering; it represents a significant step in the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the decentralized world of cryptocurrencies. It signifies a future where accessing digital assets is as straightforward and secure as any other banking transaction. This integration enhances accessibility, reduces friction, and builds trust, which are critical for mainstream adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As the digital economy continues to evolve, the ability of financial institutions to adapt and innovate will determine their relevance. BVCU has demonstrated remarkable foresight and courage in becoming the first Canadian credit union to offer such a direct Bitcoin service, setting a high bar for others to follow. This initiative paves the way for a more integrated, efficient, and accessible financial system for all Canadians.

According to Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee, the reforms, unveiled on July 9, will “target criminals” by restricting their ability to convert large volumes of illgotten cash into crypto through virtual currency kiosks. In this regard, New Zealand will introduce a bill to enhance enforcement powers for police and regulators and to expand the capabilities of the Financial Intelligence Unit in tracking financial activity linked to persons of interest. “We want New Zealand to be one of the easiest places in the world to do legitimate business and one of the hardest for criminals to hide,” McKee said, adding that the overhaul would cut unnecessary red tape for low-risk entities while allowing regulators to focus their efforts on serious financial threats. Meanwhile, by capping international cash transfers to $5,000, regulators hope to limit how criminal groups move illicit funds offshore while preserving legitimate remittance options through electronic bank channels.

As of press time, New Zealand authorities have not provided a timeline for when these new measures would be enforced. Crypto ATMS, which enable cash purchases of digital currencies, have been identified as a key laundering tool in multiple reports. A 2024 report from New Zealand’s Ministerial Advisory Group on Transnational, Serious and Organised Crime found that criminals used these kiosks to send funds abroad “within minutes” to finance drug imports and scams. Concern over the misuse of crypto kiosks has been mounting among regulators worldwide. An FBI report linked crypto ATMs to $246 million in fraud-related losses across the U.S. in 2024, with over 11,000 complaints. Last month, Spokane, Washington, became the first city in the state to enact a full ban , giving operators 60 days to remove over 40 kiosks following a rise in fraud complaints. Officials said scammers frequently impersonated police or tax authorities to pressure victims into using the machines to transfer funds. Similarly, Nebraska passed the Controllable Electronic Record Fraud Prevention Act earlier this year, mandating state licensing for ATM operators, capping fees at 18%, and setting daily limits of $2,000 for new users. It also introduced mandates for kiosk operators to refund requirements for defrauded customers who report scams within 90 days. Australia’s financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, also moved to tighten oversight in June 2025, imposing a 5,000 Australian dollar cash cap per transaction, mandatory scam warnings, and enhanced customer due diligence obligations.

Trading volume has jumped 71.4% to $92 million, with derivatives volume up 67.87% to $83.75 million, as per Coinglass data . Open interest has also climbed 10.98%, now standing at $98.7 million. These figures point to increased activity in both the spot and derivatives network. The upcoming upgrade marks a significant step in Polygon’s roadmap. Since Polygon proof-of-stake launched in 2020, Heimdall v2 has been “the most technically complex hard fork,” according to co-founder Sandeep Nailwal.

Finality may lag by up to 3 hours during the migration, so dApps are encouraged to temporarily raise confirmation thresholds. The update was successfully deployed on the Amoy testnet on June 24, giving the team confidence that the transition would proceed smoothly. Two significant improvements that were tested include PIP-62 and PIP-44, which are focused on dependency handling and genesis state import. On the daily chart, POL is showing early signs of a breakout. The token has surpassed both the 20-day exponential moving average at $0.1686 and the 20-day simple moving average at $0.1823.

If bulls hold above the $0.196 resistance-turned-support, POL might retest the $0.22–$0.24 range. On the downside, the price might drop back to the lower Bollinger Band, which is at $0.168, if $0.19 is not held.

On February 21, one of the global crypto exchanges suffered a record-setting $1.4 billion hack, marking the largest single-theft event in crypto history. This attack, reportedly attributed to the Lazarus Group, highlighted persistent industry-wide vulnerabilities concerning advanced attack methodologies, systemic weaknesses, and inadequate cross-platform risk management frameworks. In response to these critical events, HTX reaffirmed its commitment to robust security by substantially increasing its investment. Through enhanced risk management protocols, strengthened operational security, and advanced intelligence capabilities, HTX has achieved comprehensive protection across accounts, trading, and assets. These proactive measures have successfully mitigated several high-risk threats, thereby safeguarding user assets and reinforcing trust within the HTX ecosystem. Crypto Industry Faces Evolving Security Challenges The crypto industry is experiencing a surge in the frequency and sophistication of threats, including hacks, scams, and malicious on-chain behaviors. The threat landscape has evolved from isolated phishing to multi-vector attacks, such as social engineering attacks, malicious contract deployment, UI spoofing, and deepfake deception. These tactics often exploit vulnerabilities between platform security systems. At the same time, global regulators are tightening compliance expectations. Many jurisdictions have introduced regulatory frameworks for virtual asset service providers, mandating adherence with anti-money laundering regulations, enhanced account protection, and stringent risk management and auditing practices. This raises the bar for industry-wide security and compliance. On a positive note, core defense technologies such as on-chain traceability, AI-powered risk engines, and automated contract audits are becoming essential across major platforms, enhancing readiness and risk intelligence. HTX Security Infrastructure: New Systems. New Tech. New Paradigm. In 2025, HTX continued its transition toward a multi-layered security model, introducing critical upgrades across its three core protection pillars: Risk Management Architecture: HTX developed an in-house millisecond-level real-time risk engine that monitors every user interaction. Every high-risk behavior is dynamically filtered to mitigate account compromise, money laundering, and malicious activity. 24/7 Operational Security: HTX’s dedicated security operations and customer support teams operate on a round-the-clock cycle, enabling real-time response and full-cycle risk resolution. Threat Intelligence: HTX partners with top security firms, project teams, and other exchanges to maintain a real-time threat map. This collaboration accelerates cross-platform incident response, dark web surveillance, and hacker attribution. Furthermore, HTX upgraded its PoR data storage to TiDB, improving system stability and efficiency, while reducing operational and maintenance costs. This contributed to substantial growth in overall user assets and a steady increase in core reserves during the first half of 2025, with continuous net growth in cryptocurrencies like USDT and ETH, demonstrating growing user trust. Building a Trust-Centric, Resilient Crypto Ecosystem As one HTX security expert put it, ” attacks have evolved from code exploits to targeting human weaknesses. Therefore, we’ve enhanced the integration of behavioral analytics and zero-trust architecture and brought three key upgrades to life: dynamic permission validation, end-to-end transaction authentication, and continuous red-blue team threat simulation. These aren’t just upgrades but are foundational steps toward long-term user protection and ecosystem synergy.” Dynamic Permission Verification: At HTX, every fund operation now requires dual authentication, combining environment tagging with biometric validation. This ensures actions align with both the user and their operating environment. End-to-End Transaction Authentication: By validating transaction payloads at the smart contract level, HTX eliminates risks from compromised UIs, closing the gap on deceptive front-end manipulation. Always-On Red-Blue Simulation: Monthly, HTX’s security team simulates real-world attacks from top APT groups and hackers, constantly stress-testing the platform’s defenses and closing the loop between offense and response. HTX firmly believes that only a deeply integrated, multi-dimensional security architecture — coupled with a transparent, collaborative approach — can serve as the foundation for long-term user trust. As the threat landscape grows more complex, HTX will continue investing heavily in security innovation and infrastructure. Its mission is to not only defend against emerging threats, but to lead the crypto industry into a future that’s safer, smarter, and more sustainable for millions worldwide. About HTX Founded in 2013, HTX has evolved from a virtual asset exchange into a comprehensive ecosystem of blockchain businesses that span digital asset trading, financial derivatives, research, investments, incubation, and other businesses. As a world-leading gateway to Web3, HTX harbors global capabilities that enable it to provide users with safe and reliable services.

One such event that has captured significant attention is the latest token transfer by prominent venture capital firm, a16z crypto . This isn’t just any routine transaction; it signals a complete exit from a substantial position in a well-known DeFi asset, raising questions about its potential implications for the broader crypto market . What Just Happened with A16z Crypto’s COMP Holdings? In a move that has caught the eye of on-chain analysts and investors alike, a16z crypto , the dedicated crypto arm of Andreessen Horowitz, has completely offloaded its remaining 400,000 COMP token holdings. This significant sum, valued at approximately $16.48 million, was transferred to Coinbase Prime just hours ago, as reported by blockchain tracking service @EmberCN on X. This latest transaction isn’t an isolated incident; it follows a similar large-scale movement a mere 10 days prior. To put this into perspective: First Transfer: Roughly 400,000 COMP tokens moved to Coinbase Prime. Latest Transfer: An additional 400,000 COMP tokens moved, marking a full divestment. Total Value: The combined transfers amount to a staggering 800,000 COMP, with a cumulative value of $34.81 million moved in less than two weeks. This complete exit from their COMP token position by such a heavyweight institution naturally prompts an examination of its potential ripple effects. Understanding the COMP Token and Its Market Position For those new to the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, the COMP token is the native governance token of Compound Finance, a leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Holders of COMP can propose and vote on changes to the protocol, giving them a direct say in its future development and parameters. Compound Finance has been a foundational pillar of the DeFi ecosystem, enabling users to earn interest on their crypto assets or borrow against them without traditional intermediaries. Given its role and prominence, any major movement of COMP tokens, especially from an entity like a16z crypto , is closely watched. Since the initial transfer 10 days ago, the price of COMP has already experienced a notable dip, falling approximately 11% from $46 to $41. This suggests that the market has already begun to price in the increased supply from institutional selling pressure. The latest transfer could very well exacerbate this downward trend, creating further volatility for COMP token holders. Why Coinbase Prime for Such a Massive Token Transfer? The choice of Coinbase Prime for these large-scale transfers is significant. Coinbase Prime is not your typical retail cryptocurrency exchange. It is an institutional-grade platform designed for high-net-worth individuals, hedge funds, and corporate clients, offering a suite of services tailored for large-volume trading. These services include: Deep Liquidity: Access to substantial order books and over-the-counter (OTC) desks, allowing for large trades without significant price slippage. Enhanced Security: Robust custody solutions and security protocols essential for institutional assets. Execution Services: Advanced trading tools and professional execution services to manage large orders discreetly. When an entity like a16z crypto chooses Coinbase Prime , it’s typically to execute a large sale without disrupting the broader market with a direct dump on open exchanges. OTC desks facilitate private, negotiated trades, minimizing the immediate impact on public order books, though the underlying supply increase still exists and can affect sentiment. The Implications of Such a Large-Scale Token Transfer A token transfer of this magnitude by a major venture firm carries several implications, both for the specific asset and the broader crypto market : Increased Selling Pressure: While the transfer to Coinbase Prime might mitigate immediate market impact, the intent to sell $34.81 million worth of COMP means a significant amount of supply is now available for distribution. This naturally creates downward pressure on the token’s price as demand must absorb this new supply. Shifting Portfolio Strategy: Venture capital firms constantly rebalance their portfolios. A complete exit from a position like COMP could signal a strategic shift. This might be due to profit-taking after a successful investment, a reallocation of capital to newer or more promising projects, or a change in outlook regarding Compound Finance’s long-term prospects or the broader DeFi landscape. Investor Sentiment: The actions of major institutional investors like a16z crypto are often seen as bellwethers for market trends. A full divestment can trigger concerns among retail investors, potentially leading to panic selling or a loss of confidence in the asset. This herd mentality can amplify price movements. Liquidation Events: For a fund, this is a liquidation event. It frees up capital that can then be deployed into other ventures, potentially in different sectors of the crypto space or even outside of it. Understanding these implications is crucial for anyone navigating the volatile world of digital assets. Navigating the Crypto Market Amidst Institutional Moves The recent actions by a16z crypto serve as a powerful reminder of the dynamics at play within the crypto market . Institutional movements, while often executed with discretion, can have tangible effects on token prices and overall market sentiment. For individual investors, staying informed and understanding these shifts is paramount. Here are some actionable insights for navigating such events: Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools and analysts that track large token transfer events can provide early warnings of potential selling pressure. Following reputable on-chain data providers can give you an edge. Understand the ‘Why’: While speculation is common, try to understand the potential reasons behind an institutional exit. Is it profit-taking, a strategic pivot, or a loss of confidence? This context can help inform your own decisions. Don’t Panic Sell: While an 11% drop is significant, knee-jerk reactions often lead to losses. Evaluate your own investment thesis for the COMP token or any other asset. Diversify Your Portfolio: Relying too heavily on a single asset, especially one subject to large institutional influence, can be risky. Diversification helps mitigate the impact of adverse movements in any single asset. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between short-term price fluctuations driven by large sales and the long-term fundamentals of a project. Is Compound Finance still a robust protocol with a strong community and development? Conclusion: What Does A16z Crypto’s COMP Exit Mean for You? The complete divestment of 800,000 COMP token s by a16z crypto , executed through Coinbase Prime , marks a significant event in the DeFi landscape. While such institutional maneuvers are a natural part of portfolio management, they undeniably contribute to market volatility and can influence investor sentiment. The immediate impact on the COMP token price has been clear, and further pressure may be on the horizon as the market absorbs this supply. For investors, this episode underscores the importance of vigilance, independent research, and a clear understanding of market dynamics. While the actions of major funds like a16z crypto can provide valuable signals, ultimately, sound investment decisions in the ever-evolving crypto market are built on comprehensive analysis and a well-defined personal strategy.

Voting on UMA protocol swayed a prediction market with over $200M at stake. Polymarket is facing backlash after the resolution of one prediction pair showed unfairness and a possible governance attack from UMA holders. The prediction pair in question was targeting current news, where issues may be contentious to resolve. In this case, Polymarket opened a token pair for the question ‘Will Zelenskyy wear a suit before July?’. The market turned highly volatile, but the weight of ‘No’ votes expanded suspiciously in June. The Polymarket platform faces the credibility issue just as open interest is on the rise. For the past month, open interest on prediction pairs increased from $88M to over $138M. Polymarket also retains a baseline of around 20K daily active traders. Following the announcement of a partnership with X , Polymarket came to be seen as an arbiter of current news and a tool to decide on truth. The Zelenskyy suit debacle may undermine that authority. Current news were among the most active prediction markets, on par or surpassing sports events. Yet current news are also the issue most open to interpretation and volatile trading. Polymarket prediction pair shifts over $200M to improbable vote What the Polymarket community missed was that Zelenskyy’s sartorial choice would not be confirmed by common sense or even suit experts, but by voting through UMA tokens. The pair has since been removed, but the discussion continues on social media. The prediction platform partnered with UMA in February, allowing token holders to use their stake and vote on market resolution. However, soon after that, Polymarket suffered its first governance attack . This time around, Polymarket faced stakes at over $200M, raising suspicions that UMA was used to hijack the decision process and extract funds for whales. UMA whales staked $25M to dispute the vote The prediction pair has now been removed from Polymarket as resolved. However, analysis of the voting shows the market almost resolved to ‘Yes’, which was the position of the wider community. Media also reported Zelenskyy wore a suit, with more evidence emerging that the garment was not traditional, but could be called a suit. Even the designer admitted the garment was more likely to be considered a suit, as the opinion on ‘Yes’ initially prevailed. The bigger problem was the ability to propose an alternative outcome to betting pairs, while making a relatively small stake. The other big problem is that most of the supply of UMA tokens is controlled by whales, allowing them to sway contested decisions. In theory, UMA whales could sway multiple markets with an illogical outcome. However, most of the governance attacks pick prediction pairs with enough gray zone and plausible deniability. UMA whales staked 23M tokens for this issue, valued at $25M. The staked assets grant an additional 21% annualised yield. Just four whales control over 40% of the UMA supply, while the biggest whale holds 25% of the token supply. However, Uma Protocol only slashes a small part of the stake for malicious voting. Even when contested, an issue cannot escape the influence of UMA whales. The Polymarket community is now calling for a revision of the oracle resolution system, to make it independent from human opinion and whale coordination.

Ardoino announced that Tether aims to become the world's largest Bitcoin miner by the end of this year. Tether CEO: “We Will Be the World's Largest Bitcoin Miner by the End of the Year” He also argued that the company plays a significant role not only in the crypto assets space but also in the expansion of global dollar dominance. The CEO stated that Tether will make a bigger profit this year compared to 2024. The company, which announced a profit of $13.7 billion in 2024, is expected to surpass this figure by the end of 2025. Ardoino said that Tether has no plans to go public in the near future, emphasizing that the company is satisfied with the current structure and will continue to maintain its independence. According to the CEO, Tether’s next wave of growth will come from the commodities trading sector. “Almost all major commodities traders are currently engaging with Tether. This space presents a tremendous opportunity for Tether,” Ardoino said. Stating that Tether's stablecoin USDT, which is pegged to the US dollar, is actually silently expanding the global hegemony of the US dollar, Ardoino argued that stablecoins have become a critical tool in this balance of power. These ambitious steps by Tether seem to have repercussions not only in the cryptocurrency markets but also in the global financial architecture. *This is not investment advice.

As the officials noted that crypto kiosks mainly attract users seeking anonymity to covert illegal funds, the industry leaders supported the government’s decision to ban Bitcoin banks. New Zealand Government’s Strict Action on Money Laundering Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee announced the decision on Wednesday. The legislation is creating a bill that expands powers for police and regulators to address financial crime in the country. McKee emphasised that the government is serious about targeting criminals and enforcing the powers of regulators to crack down on money laundering criminals. She stated, “We are committed to combating illicit fund flows and criminal activities associated with cash and cryptocurrency.” Key Highlights of the Crypto Kiosks Ban in New Zealand Ban on Cryptocurrency ATMs: The reform will halt the use of approximately 220 crypto ATMs in the country. It aims to mitigate any illicit use of financial systems Targeting Offshore Crypto Crimes: After the Ministerial Advisory Group on Transnational, Serious and Organised Crime highlighted that criminals often use crypto ATMs to trade with offshore criminals for funding drug import and scams, the government took immediate action to ban crypto ATMs. Limiting International Transfers: In order to curb money laundering and criminal finance, New Zealand is capping international transfers at $5,000. This move will also enhance the country’s financial surveillance capabilities. Enforcing AML and CFT in New Zealand Nicole McKee assured that the new approach will develop more clarity and consistency for businesses while preventing criminal misuse of financial systems. Moreover, the government will also enable the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to oversee the ensure of anti-money laundering ( AML) and combating terrorism in finance (CFT) compliance in businesses. New Zealand Aspires to Be the Most Secure Region for Crypto During the press release, the Associate Justice Minister stated that New Zealand is determined to become the easiest place in the world for legitimate crypto trading. The country is motivated to implement stricter laws to make the country one of the hardest regions for criminals to hide. “By cutting unnecessary red tape, we’re giving honest businesses room to grow, while sharpening our focus on serious threats,” Nicole McKee says.

In a recent post , GMGN co-founder Haze highlighted the increase in malicious attacks on the platform due to Maximal Extractable Value-powered bots. Due to the influx, Haze said that the platform has installed a new MEV-protection feature to help its users stay safe from attacks . However, Haze also acknowledged that the system is not perfect. Therefore, the co-founder urged users to reach out to the team if they are still suffering from attacks even with the security system in place. Users who have encountered sandwich attacks under GMGN’s MEV protection feature can get compensated for their losses by providing their transaction hash number and apply for verification through the official channels. “If it has been verified that MEV was enabled [during the attack] and you were sandwiched, we will compensate you,” said Haze in their post.

Out of the hundred-thousand malicious attacks, as much as 23,600 SOL was stolen from users. Out of the total 260,000 attacks, around 30.8% of them took place on the GMGN platform. Even though GMGN is one of the Solana-based platforms with a relatively small amount of trading volume compared to larger ones, it was still the most impacted app by attack percentage ratioed to its trading volume. Other mainstream trading platforms, such as centralized exchanges Binance and Bitget, have been trying to tackle the problem of MEV sandwich attack through a myriad of ways. For example, Binance informed users that their accounts could get revoked if they are caught using MEV bots to cheat the Alpha Points system. Meanwhile, Bitget Wallet recently upgraded the MEV protection on its platform to prevent unfair trading mechanisms through the use of bots.

Bitcoin remains mostly unfazed and shows growing confidence among investors. The institutional demand also remains strong with steady ETF inflows. New Tariffs Incoming President Trump shared in a Tuesday evening post that he is all set to announce new trade tariffs targeting at least 7 countries, with more to be followed later. This would spark sudden volatility across global stock markets and crypto. The letters will announce new tariffs of 25% to 40%, set to take effect on August 1, 2025. Will Crypto Market Drop Again? He has warned earlier that if 14 countries don’t strike trade deals by early next month, then tariffs will jump back to the higher April levels. Recently, he slapped tariffs of 25% to 40% on 14 countries, and it quickly impacted the crypto market. Within 24 hours, the total market had dropped 4.5% and all the major coins were trading in red. Bitcoin dipped 1.56% to just under $108,000, while Ethereum fell 1.89% to $2,535. Dogecoin saw the biggest drop, sliding 4.78%. BREAKING: U.S. TO IMPOSE TARIFFS ON 7 COUNTRIES STARTING AUGUST 1.

The impact was seen in the broader market, too. The Dow, S&P 500, and NASDAQ all dropped. This was similar to what happened in April, when U.S.-China trade tensions sent Bitcoin below $80K and triggered major sell-offs. Trump has also announced an additional 10% tariffs on countries that support BRICS. With more tariffs set to kick in on August 1, the crypto market could stay under pressure, and further declines are also possible. Critics warn that Trump’s tough tariff plans could hurt the global economy and even push the U.S. toward a recession. But he has held by them and says that it’s necessary. Trump Says Tariffs Have No Effect on Inflation The U.S. just added over $350 billion in debt in a single day, hitting a new all-time high and the biggest spike since 2024. Analysts claim that this is bullish for Bitcoin and crypto as concerns over fiat stability continue to grow. The hopes for a July rate cut have also faded from 90% to just 61%. The rising tariffs and inflation fears may keep the Fed from easing, and this could limit crypto’s upside. However, Trump claims that according to a new CEA study, tariffs had “zero” impact on inflation. He is now calling out Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates immediately. Bullish Momentum For Bitcoin? Bitcoin’s breakout is strong, and the market is holding up. Some analysts believe that the worst-case scenarios, including a potential war, are already priced in. With rising money supply, there could be bullish months for both crypto and stocks, targeting $120K–$130K for BTC.

The fully backed USD deposit token distinguishes itself from decentralized stablecoins like USDT or USDC through its permissioned structure, which is designed for institutional compliance and regulatory oversight. Speaking with Cryptonews, Jesse Pollak, Base creator and Coinbase VP of Engineering, emphasized the network’s institutional advantages: “Base offers sub-second, sub-cent, 24/7 settlement, which makes fund transfers between J.P. Morgan institutional clients nearly instant.” “ Moving money onchain takes seconds, rather than days, and we’re glad to see institutions like J.P. Morgan support digital assets for their clients ,” Lauren Abendschein, VP of Institutional Sales at Coinbase, also added. Moreover, Shopify’s USDC integration through Shopify Payments and Shop Pay marks another significant milestone in mainstream adoption, enabling millions of merchants across 34 countries to accept stablecoin payments directly. The Commerce Payment Protocol, built on Base, addresses traditional crypto commerce complexities through sophisticated escrow architecture supporting authorization, capture, and refunds. The protocol prevents operators from modifying payment intents through cryptographic mechanisms while offering automatic fund reclaim capabilities. Transaction fees typically remain under $0.01 compared to traditional payment networks, with settlement times reaching 200 milliseconds across international borders.

A recent bombshell from the U.S. Department of Justice has once again highlighted this reality, with two individuals indicted in Puerto Rico for their alleged involvement in the staggering OmegaPro crypto fraud case, a scheme that reportedly siphoned off a colossal $650 million from unsuspecting investors worldwide. What Was the OmegaPro Crypto Fraud Scheme? At its core, OmegaPro presented itself as a legitimate online trading and marketing company, luring in countless individuals with promises of extraordinary returns. The alleged scheme revolved around the sale of fraudulent “investment packages.” Victims were told their funds would be expertly managed through advanced forex trading, guaranteeing an astounding 300% return on investment over just 16 months. This was an alluring proposition, especially for those new to the complexities of digital assets and traditional financial markets. However, the reality, as uncovered by the authorities, was far from what was advertised. Instead of legitimate trading, the operation allegedly functioned as a classic Ponzi scheme. Funds from new investors were used to pay off earlier investors, creating an illusion of profitability. A critical aspect of the scheme was its reliance on cryptocurrency for transactions. Victims were instructed to pay in digital currencies, which were then allegedly funneled through a labyrinth of wallets controlled by OmegaPro executives and distributed to insiders. This sophisticated method of payment and distribution was designed to obscure the origins and movement of the illicit funds, making it incredibly difficult for victims to trace their money. The Shocking Indictment: Who’s Behind the Allegations? The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on July 8 that two men have been formally indicted in Puerto Rico in connection with the OmegaPro case. While the names of the individuals were not immediately released in the initial press statement, the significance of this indictment cannot be overstated. It marks a critical step in bringing alleged perpetrators of large-scale crypto fraud to justice, sending a clear message that law enforcement agencies are increasingly equipped and determined to pursue these complex cases across international borders. The charges laid against the defendants are severe, including conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. These charges reflect the multifaceted nature of the alleged scheme, encompassing both the deception used to acquire funds and the methods employed to conceal and move those funds through the global financial system, often leveraging the pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions. The involvement of the DOJ underscores the serious federal implications of such a massive financial crime. Unpacking the Modus Operandi of a $650M Crypto Scam The OmegaPro case serves as a stark reminder of the common tactics employed in a sophisticated crypto scam . Understanding these red flags is crucial for anyone navigating the digital asset space: Unrealistic Returns: Any investment promising guaranteed returns of 300% or more in a short period should immediately raise a red flag. Legitimate investments carry risk, and high returns are never guaranteed. Pressure to Recruit: Many such schemes operate with a multi-level marketing (MLM) component, where participants are incentivized to recruit new investors. This is a hallmark of pyramid schemes, where the focus is on recruitment rather than genuine product or service sales. Lack of Transparency: OmegaPro allegedly provided vague details about its trading strategies and how funds were managed. Legitimate investment platforms offer clear, verifiable information about their operations, team, and financial performance. Cryptocurrency Payment Demands: While crypto is a legitimate payment method, schemes often demand payment in crypto to exploit its decentralized and less regulated nature, making it harder to trace transactions and recover funds. Complex Jargon and Exclusivity: Scammers often use technical jargon to confuse potential victims and create an aura of exclusive knowledge, making it seem like only they possess the secret to immense wealth. The alleged funnelling of funds through controlled wallets and distribution to insiders highlights a classic money laundering technique, designed to obfuscate the money trail and make it exceedingly difficult for law enforcement to track the illicit gains. Navigating the Perils of a Fraudulent Investment Scheme For investors, the OmegaPro case is a critical lesson in vigilance. Protecting yourself from a fraudulent investment scheme requires a proactive approach and adherence to fundamental principles of financial due diligence. Here are some actionable insights: Key Action Why It Matters Do Your Own Research (DYOR) Don’t rely solely on testimonials or promises. Investigate the company, its founders, and its track record independently. Look for red flags like a lack of clear business registration or verifiable financial statements. Verify Regulatory Compliance Check if the company is registered with relevant financial authorities (e.g., SEC, CFTC, local financial regulators). Unregistered entities are a major red flag. Understand the Technology Before investing in any crypto-related project, take the time to understand the underlying blockchain technology, the project’s whitepaper, and its real-world utility. Be Skeptical of High Returns If an offer sounds too good to be true, it almost certainly is. Sustainable, legitimate investments offer reasonable, not astronomical, returns. Seek Professional Advice Consult with a licensed financial advisor before making significant investments, especially in complex or emerging markets like cryptocurrency. Remember, the burden of proof often falls on the investor to demonstrate due diligence, especially in unregulated or loosely regulated markets. Your vigilance is your best defense against predatory schemes. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto? The Role of the DOJ The successful pursuit and DOJ indictment in cases like OmegaPro are crucial for the long-term health and credibility of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While the digital asset space continues to innovate at a rapid pace, it has also become a fertile ground for illicit activities due to its borderless nature and perceived anonymity. The active involvement of law enforcement agencies globally signals a maturing regulatory landscape. These indictments demonstrate that authorities are enhancing their capabilities to track crypto transactions, collaborate internationally, and bring sophisticated fraudsters to justice. This increased enforcement is vital for building trust among mainstream investors and institutions, which is essential for the broader adoption of blockchain technology and digital currencies. While challenges remain in fully regulating a decentralized space, every successful prosecution reinforces the message that the crypto world is not a lawless frontier. A Wake-Up Call for Vigilance The OmegaPro crypto fraud case, with its staggering $650 million alleged losses and the recent indictments, serves as a powerful reminder of the risks inherent in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. It underscores the critical need for investors to exercise extreme caution, conduct thorough due diligence, and remain skeptical of promises that defy economic reality. As law enforcement agencies like the DOJ continue to crack down on these illicit operations, the hope is that the cryptocurrency space can gradually shed its association with scams and emerge as a more secure and trustworthy environment for innovation and investment.

Liquidation data shows a major short cluster near $42, suggesting potential for a sharp short squeeze. Large Inflows and Whale Activity Fuel Interest in HYPE Four wallets collectively deposited $6.14 million in USDC into Hyperliquid, purchasing HYPE tokens seven hours ago. One newly created address alone contributed $1 million, acquiring 25,507 HYPE at an average price of $39.2. 4 wallets deposited 6.14M $USDC to Hyperliquid to buy $HYPE 7 hours ago.

The HYPE price traded at $39.07 at press time, with a 24-hour trading volume of over $230 million. Hyperliquid’s native token has gained 5.35% in the last 24 hours and 3.93% weekly. The move has attracted attention, especially with whale wallets increasing exposure during a sensitive price phase. Over $40M in HYPE to Be Unstaked Before Kinetiq Launch Ahead of the Kinetiq platform’s launch on July 15, over 1 million HYPE—worth approximately $40 million—is being unstaked. Three whale addresses account for 847,000 of that total, indicating a coordinated shift in token positioning. The unstaking period is aligned with a 7-day window following the Kinetiq announcement. Market watchers expect these tokens to be restaked through Kinetiq, a new liquid staking platform that supports validator scoring and institutional access via iHYPE. The protocol has already partnered with FlowDesk and IMC Trading for deployment. Additionally, Hyperliquid’s ecosystem continues to grow, with Phantom now offering perpetual trading access directly through its wallet interface. The feature is initially available to users in the EU, using Hyperliquid’s API to maintain non-custodial control. Introducing: Phantom Perps Go long or short in just a few taps. 100+ markets. Up to 40x leverage. All in your pocket. Powered by @HyperliquidX pic.twitter.com/YDKjUGBdEn — Phantom (@phantom) July 8, 2025 This integration marks another step in expanding the protocol’s reach. It adds utility for HYPE holders and traders seeking permissionless exposure to derivatives without leaving their wallets. Liquidation Map Suggests Short Squeeze Potential According to Coinglass , the Hyperliquid liquidation map indicates that the current HYPE price is just below a major cluster of short positions. If the asset crosses $42, a short squeeze could follow, potentially triggering over $6 million in liquidations. Long liquidation pressure appears limited below $32. This setup suggests that downside risk may be less intense, especially as whales prepare to transition their HYPE holdings into staking via Kinetiq, rather than selling. The data points to strategic movement rather than exit activity.

MANA price could reach a maximum of $0.33 to $1.10 in 2025. Decentraland price with a potential surge could go as high as $5.25 by 2030. Decentraland is a leading community-driven virtual world powered by the Ethereum blockchain , where users can explore, connect, and build using its native ERC-20 token, MANA. Known as one of the top VR metaverse platforms, it continues to grow with regular ecosystem upgrades, strong development activity. If you’re curious about Decentraland’s future and wondering whether MANA is a good investment, this MANA price prediction 2025–2030 will walk you through its potential growth and long-term outlook Table of contents Story Highlights Overview CoinPedia’s Decentraland Price Prediction MANA Price Prediction 2025 Decentraland Price Prediction 2026 – 2030 Market Analysis Factors Affecting The Price Of MANA Token Historical Market Analysis FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Decentraland Token MANA Price $ 0.27798592 5.81% Market Cap $ 547,556,923.0498 Circulating Supply 1,969,729,010.3688 Trading Volume $ 27,884,028.9665 All-time High $5.90 on 25th November 2021 All-time Low $0.00788 on 14th October 2017 CoinPedia’s Decentraland Price Prediction As per the formulated price prediction, the MANA crypto price could hit a potential high of $1.05 in 2025. This could be possible if the project seeks assistance from developments and collaborations. In contrast, factors like a prolonged bear run could spiral the price down to $0.42. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $0.42 $0.73 $1.05 MANA Price Prediction 2025 Decentraland price has faced a challenging journey, hitting a low of $0.1903 on April 6, 2025. Despite this setback, the cryptocurrency made a notable recovery, doubling to $0.3935 by mid-May. However, the optimism was short-lived, as MANA experienced a significant decline throughout the rest of May and into June, dropping nearly 38% from its mid-May peak of $0.40. Yet, early July brought a glimmer of hope. MANA began to show signs of life, riding a short-term upward trendline. It successfully flipped the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands, indicating a potential shift in momentum. If this upward trajectory continues, bolstered by the multi-month support block, reaching $0.5612 by the end of July seems likely, especially if it can breach the “Change of Character (ChoCh)” $0.37 level and the 200-day EMA. For those with a more ambitious outlook, a target of $1.10 could also be on investors’ list and has odds of this target emerging by the close of 2025, provided the market sees a resurgence similar to the one in Q4 2024. Conversely, the situation could take a turn for the worse. If the multi-month support fails again, we might witness a repeat of the sharp decline seen in early April. Should the bears regain control, MANA could tumble back to its April low of $0.1903, with the potential for even lower lows. As market participants ponder the future of MANA, it’s essential to look at its multi-year chart. Since the FTX crash in 2021, MANA has plummeted from a staggering high of over $5.91. This long-term perspective reveals a consolidation phase, especially when compared to its peak in 2021. In 2025, MANA finds itself at a critical juncture, down 95% from its all-time high. However, if it can break through the $1.10 barrier by year-end, it could signal the dawn of a new bullish era for this cryptocurrency. Additionally, the exchange reserve data from CryptoQuant adds to the bullish sentiment surrounding Decentraland (MANA). In 2022, MANA’s exchange reserves were approximately 543 million tokens, but this figure gradually declined to 449 million by 2024. This trend indicates that investors have shown sustained interest in the project and have been accumulating over the years. Source: CryptoQuant However, in the last quarter of 2024, exchange reserves spiked from 449 million to 477 million MANA. This increase coincided with a period of offloading as MANA’s began to fall. Despite this, throughout the first half of 2025, the price continued to decline, while investors took advantage of the lower prices to accumulate more tokens. As a result, exchange reserves plummeted from 477 million to an unprecedented 355 million MANA.

Crypto has always promised something radical: shared ownership, collective decision-making, and communities empowered by technology. From Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) pseudonymous roots to Ethereum’s ( ETH ) programmable governance, the narrative of decentralization has inspired millions to participate in reshaping the future of finance and culture. And yet, in 2025, the reality might feel more like a performance than a transformation. You might also like: Circle’s stablecoin monopoly could be the next Visa, and that’s not a compliment | Opinion Today’s most celebrated web3 platforms still rely on decision-making models that look surprisingly centralized. The teams that launch “community-owned” protocols often retain control long after the initial fanfare fades. Token voting systems give outsized power to wealthy insiders. And communities (the very people meant to govern, guide, and grow these ecosystems) are increasingly sidelined… The result is a growing disillusionment across crypto circles: Has decentralization become just another buzzword? The token distribution dilemma One of the main culprits behind this credibility gap is token allocation. Many blockchain projects begin with investor-heavy cap tables, where venture capital firms, strategic partners, and founding teams receive a majority of the tokens (often at discounted prices during private rounds). When the token eventually becomes publicly tradable, the community enters late, buying in at higher valuations and holding far less governance power. The implications here are clear. From the very beginning, unfortunately, community ownership is more a slogan than a structure. The majority of votes and incentives remain concentrated in the hands of early insiders, leaving everyday users with little more than symbolic influence over decisions that affect protocol upgrades, treasury usage, or partnerships. This dynamic mirrors patterns we’ve seen elsewhere in culture. Think of fan communities that build enormous value around a franchise only to watch corporate executives dictate the creative direction. What web3 promised was different: a system where fans, users, and builders could actually co-create, steer, and benefit from the networks they supported. But the infrastructure hasn’t caught up to that vision. Governance as performance Governance systems are supposed to embody decentralization. In theory, they allow protocols to evolve through consensus with users proposing and voting on changes. But in practice, most crypto governance still runs on a “one token, one vote” model. That means those with more capital have more say. And those with the most capital (often early investors) can effectively shape outcomes with minimal input from the broader community. Turnout in governance votes tends to be very low. Quorum thresholds are sometimes manipulated. Proposals can be buried in technical language, discouraging participation from anyone outside the inner circle. Even in cases where forums exist for open discussion, the decision-making process often happens off-chain, in private chats or founder group threads. Community sentiment may be acknowledged, but it rarely changes the outcome. This isn’t an accident; the industry has quietly built systems that simulate decentralization while keeping control tightly held. It’s not unlike early gaming experiences where fans could “choose their own adventure,” but within a rigid, closed-loop world. You could pick your character’s outfit, but not the narrative. Crypto communities today are often left in a similar position: active participants in name, passive observers in reality. The cultural cost of centralized web3 Undoubtedly, communities are the heart of crypto. They onboard new users, educate curious skeptics, build experimental tooling, and create viral memes that shape the cultural relevance of protocols. But when communities begin to realize that they have no real agency, participation falters. Builders stop contributing. Advocates lose interest. The energy that once animated a protocol dissipates. This goes beyond idealism. There are practical risks to centralized control in decentralized packaging. Projects lose resilience, innovation slows, and network effects weaken. Perhaps most importantly, users begin to trust less, and not just in one project, but in the entire narrative of web3. And it’s not only users who are paying attention. Regulators have started to scrutinize whether governance systems are genuinely decentralized or just a mechanism to avoid accountability. When tokens are held by a few and decisions are made by fewer, projects risk being classified as securities. That classification brings legal consequences, exchange delistings, and operational restrictions that can stall even the most promising ecosystems. Can the industry redeem its own narrative? The truth is that the tools for genuine decentralization exist; they just require intentional design. Token voting could be replaced with mechanisms like quadratic voting, delegated councils, or contributor-based reputation systems. Community treasuries could be structured to prioritize long-term contributors and creative experimenters, not just short-term returns. There’s already a broader cultural shift happening in corporations and beyond—just look at the activist shareholders or fan-driven entertainment franchises. What these many movements share is a desire for meaningful participation—people investing not just money, but time, care, and expertise into causes and characters they believe in. Crypto has the potential to take that idea further. Imagine decentralized intellectual property systems where fans govern the direction of a character they helped create. DAOs that commission content or merchandise simultaneously with communities aligned by values, vision, and upside. That model is already emerging in pockets of the web3 space, but it requires a fundamental shift: away from performance, toward shared power. The path forward Crypto doesn’t need to abandon decentralization; it just needs to take it seriously, which means recognizing where the current model fails, redesigning governance for inclusion and transparency, and reallocating power where it belongs: with the people building and believing in these networks every day. If that shift happens, decentralization will no longer be a branding tool, and those conversations will no longer be necessary. It will become what it was always meant to be: a shared structure of value, ownership, and creativity. If it doesn’t, the industry will find itself increasingly isolated, not just from regulators, but from the very communities it claims to empower.

Matrixport: Ethereum Price Remains Strong Beyond Fundamentals It was emphasized that the ETH price has been steadily rising rather than declining, although on-chain gas fee-based activity is still at low levels and overall network interest has not fully recovered. Matrixport noted that there are a number of structural factors behind this price resistance: Increase in Corporate Demand It was noted that many institutional investors have begun adding Ethereum to their portfolios, positioning it as “digital gold.” This trend is believed to be an indication of ETH's growing acceptance as an institutional asset. Stablecoin Activities Live The fact that stablecoin issuance on the Ethereum network is still at high levels provides continuous liquidity to the ecosystem, which stands out as another important factor supporting the price. Expected Positive Impact from Regulations The GENIUS bill, which is being debated in the US and aims to regulate the stablecoin market, could create a positive environment for Ethereum in the medium to long term in terms of both regulatory clarity and institutional adoption. Seasonally Strong Period Pointing out that July is traditionally a strong period for Ethereum, Matrixport emphasized that the current price structure is shaped not only by market momentum but also by a combination of fundamental dynamics and expectations. At the end of the report, it was stated that the $2,500 level in the Ethereum price should be seen as an important technical support, and that maintaining this level is critical for bullish positions. *This is not investment advice.

The company, known for its ventures in energy, used car sales, and even virtual currency exchange, recently declared via X (formerly Twitter) that it has successfully raised an impressive ¥31.5 billion, equivalent to approximately $215 million. But what makes this news truly captivating is the intended use of these substantial funds: a strategic and ambitious Bitcoin acquisition . Why is Remixpoint Acquiring Bitcoin ? A Deep Dive into Their Strategy Remixpoint’s decision to allocate such a substantial sum towards Bitcoin is a clear indicator of a shifting paradigm in corporate finance. The firm aims to expand its current BTC holdings from 1,051 BTC to a staggering 3,000 BTC. This isn’t just a casual investment; it represents a deliberate and strategic pivot for a company rooted in energy consulting. So, why Bitcoin, and why now? Inflation Hedge: In an era of economic uncertainty and fluctuating fiat currencies, many companies view Bitcoin as a robust hedge against inflation. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply make it an attractive alternative to traditional assets susceptible to monetary policy changes. Store of Value: Bitcoin has increasingly been recognized as ‘digital gold’—a reliable store of value that can preserve purchasing power over time. For Remixpoint, this could be a long-term treasury management strategy. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can help diversify risk and potentially enhance overall portfolio returns, especially given the volatility of energy markets. Future-Proofing: As the global economy continues to digitalize, embracing cryptocurrencies can position a company at the forefront of financial innovation, potentially attracting new investors and talent. This move by Remixpoint isn’t isolated. It follows a trend set by other forward-thinking corporations like MicroStrategy, which has aggressively accumulated Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset. This growing interest from established firms lends further credibility and stability to the cryptocurrency market. Understanding the Broader Corporate Bitcoin Strategy Trend Remixpoint’s move highlights a significant trend: the increasing adoption of Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset. This isn’t just about speculation; it’s about a fundamental shift in how companies perceive and manage their balance sheets. Several factors contribute to this evolving corporate Bitcoin strategy : Benefits for Corporations: Potential for Appreciation: While volatile, Bitcoin has historically offered significant returns, potentially boosting a company’s asset base. Global Accessibility: Bitcoin offers a borderless, permissionless financial system, which can be advantageous for international operations. Transparency and Security: The blockchain’s transparent ledger and robust cryptographic security offer unique advantages over traditional financial systems, reducing counterparty risk. Challenges and Considerations: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price swings can be dramatic, posing risks to corporate balance sheets if not managed carefully. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally, which can create compliance challenges. Security Risks: Storing significant amounts of Bitcoin requires sophisticated security measures to prevent hacks and theft. Companies embarking on this path often engage specialized custody solutions and robust risk management frameworks to mitigate these challenges. Remixpoint’s substantial raise suggests a well-thought-out plan rather than a hasty decision. Implications for the Japanese Energy Firm and Beyond As a prominent Japanese energy firm , Remixpoint’s foray into large-scale Bitcoin acquisition sends a strong signal to both the traditional finance sector and the cryptocurrency market in Japan and globally. Japan has historically been a significant player in the crypto space, with early adoption and a relatively progressive regulatory stance. This move by Remixpoint could: Inspire Others: Encourage other Japanese corporations, particularly those in tech and energy, to explore similar treasury strategies. Boost Local Crypto Market: Increase liquidity and demand within the Japanese cryptocurrency ecosystem. Enhance Bitcoin’s Legitimacy: Further solidify Bitcoin’s status as a legitimate asset class for institutional investors and corporations worldwide. The energy sector, in particular, has an interesting relationship with Bitcoin, given the energy consumption associated with mining. However, as more mining operations shift towards renewable energy sources, and as companies like Remixpoint integrate digital assets into their core business, the synergy between energy and crypto could become increasingly positive and innovative. Navigating the Future of BTC Holdings : Risks and Opportunities For Remixpoint, managing its expanded BTC holdings will be crucial. While the potential for upside is significant, so are the inherent risks of cryptocurrency markets. Effective management will involve: Custody Solutions: Utilizing secure, institutional-grade custody providers to protect the assets. Risk Management: Implementing clear policies for managing price volatility, potentially through hedging strategies or by maintaining a long-term outlook. Regulatory Compliance: Staying abreast of evolving regulations in Japan and international markets to ensure full compliance. This strategic investment by Remixpoint also opens up possibilities for future innovations. Could we see more energy firms exploring blockchain technology for energy trading, supply chain management, or even tokenized energy assets? The possibilities are vast, and Remixpoint’s bold move positions them as a potential pioneer in this evolving landscape. The Bigger Picture: What Does This Mean for Bitcoin Acquisition on a Global Scale? Remixpoint’s substantial Bitcoin acquisition is more than just a company-specific event; it’s a testament to the growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a viable asset. As more corporations, large and small, consider or execute similar strategies, the overall market capitalization and stability of Bitcoin could see significant long-term benefits. This trend signifies a maturation of the cryptocurrency market, moving beyond retail speculation to serious institutional adoption. For individual investors and market observers, Remixpoint’s action serves as a strong signal. It suggests that despite market fluctuations, the underlying value proposition of Bitcoin as a decentralized, scarce, and globally accessible asset continues to resonate with sophisticated corporate treasuries looking for alternative ways to manage capital and drive future growth. Conclusion: A New Era of Corporate Finance Remixpoint’s decision to raise $215 million for a substantial Bitcoin acquisition marks a pivotal moment, not just for the company, but for the broader corporate adoption of digital assets. It highlights a strategic vision that looks beyond traditional financial instruments, embracing Bitcoin as a core component of future growth and treasury management. As more companies follow suit, we are likely to witness a profound transformation in corporate finance, where digital assets play an increasingly central role. This move by a Japanese energy consulting firm underscores Bitcoin’s growing legitimacy and its undeniable place in the global financial landscape.

47876690,https://invezz.com/?p=2793468,1752053800,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,SHIB and MUTM price prediction: which token has clearer path to massive gains?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/07/09/shib-and-mutm-price-prediction-which-token-has-clearer-path-to-massive-gains/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are capturing attention in the crypto market, each vying for investor interest with distinct trajectories. SHIB, one of the most popular memecoins, cannot get out of the current corridor, and its price is very close to 0.0000111. In the meantime, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is also rising in its presale stage 5 at a price of 0.03 with more than 11,900,000 collected and 580 million tokens distributed to 12,800 owners. As investors seek the best crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance’s structured growth and DeFi utility contrast sharply with SHIB’s uncertain recovery. Which token offers the clearer path to significant returns? Let’s explore their potential. Shiba Inu’s uphill battle SHIB is facing challenges in regaining bullish momentum. The memecoin has been trading in a narrow band of $0.0000111 and $0.0000142 but it has not been able to break the vital resistance level of 0.0000136. The low amount of trading in 2025 indicates the poor demand, and on-chain data indicates the drop of Mean Coin Age, pointing to the distribution of the tokens by the long-term holders. Adding to the pressure is the underperformance of the crypto market as the memecoin industry plummeted to a value of 54.72 billion as compared to 59.6 billion before. For SHIB to rally, a Bitcoin-led surge could drive capital into memecoins. However, without sustained buying, SHIB’s path to gains remains murky. Mutuum Finance, by contrast, offers a more defined trajectory. Mutuum Finance’s presale surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is advancing rapidly through its presale, with phase 5 currently underway and over 65% filled. Priced at $0.03, the token has risen 200% from its initial $0.01 offering. Investors buying now are guaranteed a 100% return at the $0.06 launch price, with projections suggesting a climb to $2.50 by late 2025, a potential 83x gain. The project has raised $11,900,000, reflecting strong investor confidence. Phase 6 will see a 16.7% price hike to $0.035, signaling urgency for early buyers. Mutuum Finance’s robust fundamentals make it a standout in the crypto investment space. Furthermore, its innovative features set it apart. Innovative DeFi lending model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is carving a niche in DeFi with its dual lending system. The Peer-to-Contract model uses smart contracts to automate lending, offering dynamic interest rates for stability. Conversely, the Peer-to-Peer approach enables direct, customizable lending, ideal for volatile assets. This flexibility ensures transparency and efficiency, surpassing centralized platforms. Mutuum Finance also introduces mtTokens, which represent deposits and accrue interest, tradable within the ecosystem. Staking mtTokens rewards users via token buybacks, fostering long-term engagement. Additionally, a $100,000 giveaway is boosting excitement, with 10 winners receiving $10,000 in MUTM each by investing $50 and completing simple tasks. Security enhancements further bolster its appeal. Robust security and future growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has finalized a CertiK audit, earning a 95.00 security score with no vulnerabilities in its smart contracts. This underscores the project’s commitment to safety. A $50,000 Bug Bounty Program, partnered with CertiK, rewards vulnerability discoveries across four severity tiers. Looking ahead, Mutuum Finance is developing a USD-pegged stablecoin on Ethereum. Thus enhancing liquidity and reducing volatility risks. Layer 2 scaling plans promise lower costs and faster transactions. This positions Mutuum Finance for global adoption. Consequently, its growth potential shines brightly. Shaping the future of DeFi Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as a compelling choice for investors seeking the best crypto to buy now. Unlike SHIB, which faces an uncertain recovery, Mutuum Finance offers a clear path to gains through its presale and innovative DeFi ecosystem. Investors eyeing crypto investments should explore Mutuum Finance’s presale before phase 5 closes. Don’t miss this opportunity to join a promising DeFi project.

At the heart of the latest development is a significant challenge to FTX’s restructuring plans, specifically concerning FTX payouts . This isn’t just a minor hiccup; it’s a major objection from a substantial group of stakeholders, underscoring the deep financial and legal quagmire FTX finds itself in. Who are the Chinese Creditors and Why Are They Objecting? In a powerful move, more than 500 Chinese creditors of the collapsed FTX exchange have formally objected to the exchange’s request to postpone payouts. This objection targets a proposal that seeks to delay distributions to users residing in 49 jurisdictions, particularly those with restrictive or uncertain crypto laws. The numbers are striking: a staggering $380 million in claims, representing roughly 82% of the total restricted amount, originates from these Chinese users. This isn’t just about money; it’s about justice and timely recovery for those who lost their assets in one of the largest crypto collapses in history. Their objection stems from several core concerns: Delayed Access to Funds: For many, these funds represent life savings or significant investments. Prolonging the payout process creates immense financial hardship and uncertainty. Fairness and Equality: Creditors argue that singling out specific jurisdictions, even with complex crypto laws , creates an unfair two-tiered system. They believe all creditors should be treated equally under the bankruptcy proceedings. Lack of Clarity: The reasons for the proposed delay, particularly the ambiguity around ‘uncertain crypto laws,’ are not sufficiently clear to the creditors, raising suspicions about the true motives behind such a request. Understanding the Complexities of FTX Bankruptcy The FTX bankruptcy case is a labyrinth of international law, digital asset recovery, and a multitude of aggrieved parties. When FTX collapsed in November 2022, it left millions of users worldwide in limbo, with billions of dollars in assets frozen. The current management, led by CEO John Ray III, has been working tirelessly to recover assets and devise a plan for creditor repayment. However, this process is fraught with challenges, including: Aspect of FTX Bankruptcy Challenges & Implications Asset Recovery Tracing digital assets across various blockchains, identifying commingled funds, and dealing with international legal frameworks. Valuation of Crypto Assets Fluctuating cryptocurrency prices make it difficult to determine the exact value of recovered assets at the time of distribution. Jurisdictional Hurdles Navigating different legal systems and regulations across dozens of countries, especially concerning crypto-specific laws. Creditor Communication Managing expectations and providing transparent updates to a diverse global creditor base, many of whom have suffered significant losses. The objection from Chinese creditors adds another layer of complexity, forcing the bankruptcy court to weigh the need for efficient distribution against the principles of fairness and the practicalities of international law. How Do Crypto Laws Impact Global Recoveries? The proposed delay in FTX payouts for certain jurisdictions highlights a critical issue in the global crypto landscape: the varying and often ambiguous nature of crypto laws . While some countries have established clear regulatory frameworks for digital assets, others have outright bans or operate in a legal grey area. This disparity creates significant headaches for entities like FTX, which operated globally without a unified regulatory environment. For instance, some countries may classify cryptocurrencies as securities, while others see them as commodities or simply property. This classification impacts everything from tax implications to how assets are treated in bankruptcy. FTX’s argument for delaying payouts in these jurisdictions likely stems from concerns about: Potential legal challenges from local regulators if payouts are made without clear legal standing. The risk of assets being seized or subject to additional taxes by local authorities upon distribution. Difficulties in complying with local KYC/AML (Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering) regulations during the distribution process. However, from the creditors’ perspective, these are administrative burdens that should not unduly delay their rightful access to funds. What’s Next for FTX Claims and Creditors? The objection by the Chinese creditors will now be considered by the bankruptcy court. This is a crucial moment for the future of FTX claims . The court will need to balance the arguments put forth by FTX’s legal team regarding the complexities of international crypto laws against the impassioned pleas of creditors for timely recovery. The outcome of this objection could set a precedent for how large, international crypto bankruptcies are handled in the future. For affected creditors, this situation underscores the importance of staying informed and, where possible, participating in the legal process. While individual actions might be limited, collective objections, such as this one, demonstrate the power of unity in demanding accountability and fair treatment. The road to recovery for FTX victims remains long and arduous, but every legal battle won, or even strongly contested, brings them closer to a resolution. A Lingering Question: Will Justice Prevail for All? The objection from Chinese creditors is a stark reminder that the FTX collapse is not merely a financial abstract; it affects real people across the globe. Their unified stance against the proposed payout delays injects a powerful human element into the complex legal proceedings of the FTX bankruptcy . As the court deliberates, the crypto world watches closely, hoping for a resolution that prioritizes fairness and transparency for all victims, regardless of their geographical location or the prevailing crypto laws in their jurisdiction. The ultimate test will be whether the recovery process can truly deliver justice and restore confidence in the aftermath of such a devastating financial implosion.

For many, the perception is that a massive marketing blitz, celebrity endorsements, and social media hype are the ultimate ingredients for a successful debut. However, recent research challenges this widely held belief, revealing a powerful truth: true token launch success is built on solid foundations, not fleeting fads. This article delves into why enduring value in the crypto space is rooted in robust crypto fundamentals , offering a fresh perspective for both project developers and eager investors. The Myth of Hype: What Does Research Say About Token Launch Success? The notion that a project can simply market its way to the top has been a pervasive one in the crypto industry. Yet, a revealing research note from blockchain analytics firm Simplicity Group, cited by CoinDesk, offers a starkly different conclusion. After analyzing data from 40 crypto projects that launched their tokens between January and April of this year, the findings are clear: the initial market reaction to a token launch is predominantly driven by fundamental metrics, not the volume of social media noise. This insight is crucial. It suggests that while marketing can generate initial buzz, it’s the underlying strength and structure of a project that dictates its long-term viability and investor confidence. In fact, the research even highlighted instances where excessive social media marketing was either irrelevant to actual performance or, surprisingly, had a negative impact on token debuts. This phenomenon could be attributed to a number of factors: Investor Skepticism: Over-the-top marketing without substance can trigger red flags for seasoned investors, who might perceive it as a tactic to mask underlying weaknesses. Unrealistic Expectations: Hype can inflate expectations, leading to rapid sell-offs when the initial promised returns don’t materialize, causing price crashes. Short-Term Focus: Projects heavily reliant on marketing often prioritize short-term gains over sustainable development, alienating a community seeking genuine innovation. So, if hype isn’t the answer, what truly matters? Understanding the Pillars of Crypto Fundamentals: Market Capitalization One of the primary metrics identified by Simplicity Group as a driver of initial market reaction is market capitalization . But what exactly is it, and why is it so important for a token launch? Market capitalization (often abbreviated as market cap) is simply the total value of all the circulating tokens of a cryptocurrency. It’s calculated by multiplying the current price of a single token by the total number of tokens currently in circulation. For example, if a token is priced at $1 and there are 100 million tokens in circulation, its market cap is $100 million. Why is this fundamental metric so critical? Perceived Value and Size: A higher market cap generally indicates a larger, more established, and potentially more stable project. It gives investors a quick snapshot of the project’s overall footprint in the crypto ecosystem. Liquidity Indicator: While not a direct measure, a larger market cap often correlates with higher liquidity, meaning it’s easier to buy or sell the token without significantly impacting its price. This is vital for both large institutional investors and everyday traders. Comparative Analysis: Investors often compare market caps of similar projects to gauge their relative standing and potential for growth. A project launching with a reasonable and well-justified initial market cap (relative to its competitors and development stage) tends to be viewed more favorably than one with an artificially inflated initial valuation. It’s important to distinguish between initial market cap and fully diluted valuation (FDV), which includes all tokens that will ever exist. A project with a low initial market cap but a very high FDV due to a massive future supply can still be risky. A healthy balance and transparent communication about both are crucial for investor trust. The Scarcity Factor: Why Circulating Supply Matters for Token Value Another fundamental metric that significantly influences a token’s initial performance and long-term price trajectory is its circulating supply . This refers to the number of tokens that are currently available and accessible to the public, actively trading in the market. The relationship between supply and demand is a basic economic principle, and it holds true for cryptocurrencies. A controlled and transparent circulating supply is vital for several reasons: Price Dynamics: A lower circulating supply, coupled with strong demand, can lead to a higher price per token. Conversely, a large, rapidly increasing supply without corresponding demand can dilute value. Scarcity and Value Perception: Just like precious metals, digital assets gain value from scarcity. Projects with a well-defined and managed circulating supply often instill more confidence in investors, as they understand the token’s inflationary or deflationary mechanics. Vesting Schedules and Transparency: Reputable projects clearly outline their token distribution and vesting schedules, which dictate how and when tokens held by the team, advisors, and early investors are released into the circulating supply. Transparency here builds trust and prevents sudden token dumps that could crash the price. A sudden influx of tokens into the circulating supply, for instance, from unlocked vesting periods, can significantly impact price if not managed carefully. Projects that thoughtfully plan their token release schedule, aligning it with development milestones and market absorption capacity, demonstrate a commitment to long-term sustainability rather than quick profits. The Pulse of the Market: Decoding Trading Volume as a Key Indicator The Simplicity Group research specifically underscored that the trading volume of a token within one week and one month after its Token Generation Event (TGE) is a very important indicator for predicting the token’s price. This makes intuitive sense: volume is the lifeblood of any market. Trading volume refers to the total number of tokens that have been bought and sold within a specific period. High trading volume indicates strong market interest and liquidity, while low volume can signal a lack of interest or difficulty in buying/selling the token. Here’s why trading volume is a critical fundamental: Liquidity and Ease of Transaction: High volume means there are plenty of buyers and sellers, making it easy to enter or exit positions without causing significant price fluctuations. This attracts larger investors and facilitates smoother market operations. Genuine Interest vs. Wash Trading: Consistent, organic trading volume indicates genuine interest from the community and investors in the project’s utility and potential. Conversely, artificially inflated volume (wash trading) is a red flag that can be identified by analyzing trading patterns and order book depth. Price Validation: A strong price increase accompanied by high volume is generally considered more sustainable than a price pump on low volume, which can be easily manipulated. Similarly, a price drop on high volume indicates strong selling pressure. Predictive Power: As the research suggests, early trading volume can be a powerful predictor of future price action. A token that generates consistent, healthy volume post-TGE often signifies a robust project with an engaged community and a clear value proposition. Projects should focus on fostering organic trading activity by building a strong product, attracting real users, and ensuring fair market access, rather than attempting to artificially inflate volume through dubious means. Beyond the Numbers: Building a Sustainable Future for Your Token While market capitalization , circulating supply , and trading volume are crucial fundamental metrics, they are ultimately reflections of a project’s underlying strength. For projects aiming for enduring token launch success , the focus must extend beyond just these numbers to the core elements that drive them: What Actionable Insights Can Project Teams Apply? Focus on Product and Utility First: A token’s value ultimately stems from the utility of the underlying blockchain or application. Prioritize developing a robust, innovative product that solves a real-world problem or offers significant value to users. Transparent Tokenomics: Clearly articulate the token’s purpose, distribution, vesting schedules, and how it integrates into the project’s ecosystem. Transparency builds trust and helps investors understand the long-term value proposition. Sustainable Community Engagement: Build a genuine community around your project, not just a hype-driven following. Engage with users, listen to feedback, and foster a sense of ownership and participation. A strong community is a powerful asset that drives organic interest and adoption. Strategic Exchange Listings: While listings on major exchanges can boost visibility and liquidity, rushing into them without sufficient preparation or community readiness can backfire. Prioritize strategic listings that align with your project’s growth phase and target audience. Long-Term Vision and Development: Demonstrate a clear roadmap and consistent progress. Investors are increasingly looking for projects with a long-term vision, continuous development, and adaptability to market changes. Navigating Challenges and Pitfalls Even with a strong focus on fundamentals, token launches face inherent challenges: Market Volatility: The broader crypto market can be unpredictable. Even fundamentally strong projects can be affected by bear markets or macroeconomic shifts. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape in different jurisdictions can pose challenges for token projects, requiring careful legal navigation. Investor Expectations: Managing realistic investor expectations is crucial. Over-promising and under-delivering, even unintentionally, can erode trust. Competition: The crypto space is crowded. Differentiating your project based on genuine utility and strong fundamentals is key to standing out. By proactively addressing these challenges and adhering to a fundamentals-first approach, projects can significantly increase their chances of not just a successful launch, but sustained growth and adoption. The Indelible Mark of Fundamentals: A Lasting Impression The narrative around token launch success is undergoing a significant shift. The days of projects relying solely on aggressive marketing and celebrity endorsements to pump their tokens are, thankfully, giving way to a more mature and discerning market. The research from Simplicity Group serves as a powerful reminder: true value in the crypto space is forged in the crucible of strong crypto fundamentals . Metrics like a healthy market capitalization , transparent and well-managed circulating supply , and robust trading volume are not just numbers; they are indicators of a project’s underlying strength, utility, and long-term potential. For project developers, this means a renewed focus on building solid technology, fostering genuine communities, and ensuring transparent tokenomics. For investors, it’s a call to look beyond the immediate hype and delve deeper into the core mechanics and value proposition of a token. In a market that is constantly evolving, understanding and prioritizing these fundamental drivers will be the key to identifying and participating in truly impactful and enduring crypto innovations.

ETH was trading up 2% on the day at $2,624 at the time of writing, having failed to break past the $2,600 resistance level late last week. Ethereum has gone up over 7% in the past week and is up 2.8% intraday. According to market analysts, even with institutional involvement, the asset is still trading within a tight range, locked in a sideways channel that has persisted for two months. Speaking on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin recently said corporate interest in Ethereum is climbing because they want to “tell the Ethereum story.” “What does Wall Street pay attention to? It pays attention to being able to make money,” he reckoned. GameSquare holdings commences $100 Million ETH treasury plan According to a July 8 press statement , GameSquare Holdings announced the launch of an ETH-based treasury strategy, against the backdrop of a partnership with crypto capital management firm Dialectic. The news took the company’s stock 0.57% upwards of its Tuesday closing session price, now changing hands at $1.54, according to Google Finance data . GameSquare’s Board has approved a total ETH allocation of up to $100 million, which will be deployed in stages while providing liquidity for ongoing operations. The ETH-focused treasury is built on Dialectic’s proprietary Medici platform, which integrates machine learning, automated optimization, and risk management systems. GameSquare is targeting annual yields of 8-14%, well above the current staking benchmarks of 3-4%. To help fund the Ether acquisitions, GameSquare launched a public offering of over 8.4 million shares at $0.95 per share to raise approximately $8 million. The offering was filed under a registration statement declared effective by the SEC on June 4 and is expected to close by July 9. SharpLink acquires over $533 million in ETH Another Media and Sports betting technology company, SharpLink Gaming, disclosed on Tuesday that it now holds 205,634 ETH, valued at more than $533 million, bought between June 28 and July 4.

As reported by Cryptopolitan, SharpLink’s stock rallied 7% after announcing a $30 million Ether purchase on June 25, bringing its holdings to 188,000 ETH. The company has committed all of its Ether holdings to staking and restaking protocols, earning 322 ETH in rewards, worth roughly $848,750, since June 2. SharpLink raised $64 million in net proceeds to fund the ETH investments, by selling more than 5.4 million shares. In May, it filed plans to sell up to $1 billion in common stock, with the bulk of the proceeds earmarked for more ETH acquisitions. Lubin, who is SharpLink’s chairman, said the strategy is rooted in financial discipline and transparency. “Our sustained success is a direct result of SharpLink’s disciplined execution of its ETH-centric treasury management strategy,” he remarked. Lubin explained that adding ETH to corporate treasuries helps to reduce excess Ether supply and could eventually create positive price pressure. Bit Digital goes all-in on Ethereum Meanwhile, earlier this week, Nasdaq-listed Bit Digital has completely exited its Bitcoin holdings in favor of Ethereum. The company sold all of its BTC assets, raising $172 million in the process, and used the funds to acquire more than 100,000 ETH. After buying Ethereum, Bit Digital is reportedly one of the largest corporate Ethereum treasury firms globally. “We believe Ethereum has the ability to rewrite the entire financial system.” CEO Sam Tabar told reporters earlier this week. “We are starting with exposure to over 100K ETH for now, but we intend to aggressively add more so we become the preeminent ETH holding company in the world.” Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",Ethereum|Bit Digital|ETH|GameSquare|SEC|Sharplink Gaming|USD,EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|BUSINESS|BTC,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-09 09:45:52

It is currently taking support from April lows, and breaking short-term EMA bands would trigger a rise. However, if the bearishness takes control and breaks $1.8 support, then a fall to $1 is likely. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) NEAR Crypto Price Prediction July 2025 1.0 2.75 3.50 NEAR Price Prediction 2025 After reaching a $9 peak in Q1 2024, NEAR dropped to $3.5 due to selling pressure in Q2 and consolidated in Q3. Donald Trump’s election win in Q4 boosted the altcoin sector, raising hopes for a new all-time high and crossing the $10 mark. However, NEAR only rose to $8.2 before facing a strong supply level. This supply level hindered price action in Q1 2025, causing the breach of the $3.5 multi-month support, which turned into resistance, leading to a low of $1.8. In Q2, a brief recovery occurred but ended in mid-May due to a “support-turned-resistance block.” From mid-May to the third week of June, NEAR price dipped 46% reaching April’s swing low at $1.8. But, in the fourth week of June, to early weeks of July, the NEAR price has found support at $1.8 and is riding a short-term upward trendline. In July, traits of bullish factors resurfacing are visible, and a short-term rise could occur, pushing for a retest of the $3.5 resistance. Meanwhile, on-chain shows that adoption and fundamentals are strengthening. The number of validators on the NEAR chain spikes from 283 to 312, which is bullish for NEAR. The increased validator count for NEAR signals greater decentralization, enhanced security, and improved network resilience. Source: tokenterminal Also, increased adoption and institutional interest, along with improved geopolitical conditions, could benefit the entire altcoin market. There is a strong possibility that NEAR may aim to retest the $8 to $9 supply range by the end of 2025. For this to happen, it must achieve a weekly close above $3.5 in July and register a Change of Character (ChoCh) above $4.345 in the following months for long-term bullish confirmation. If NEAR falls from this level, $1.8 will serve as its short-term defense line. A break below this could heighten investor fears, potentially targeting the $1.0 mark.

A crucial Senate Hearing on Digital Asset Oversight has been scheduled, promising to be a pivotal moment for the future of the digital economy. This isn’t just another discussion; it’s an opportunity for stakeholders to voice their perspectives directly to policymakers, potentially laying the groundwork for clearer, more comprehensive Crypto Regulation in the United States. What’s on the Agenda for This Pivotal Senate Hearing? According to Eleanor Terrett, host of Crypto In America, the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry has set July 15 for a hearing titled “Stakeholder Perspectives on Federal Oversight of Digital Commodities.” This title itself offers a glimpse into the committee’s focus: understanding how various parties view the regulation of digital assets that fall under the commodity classification. But why the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry? It might seem counterintuitive at first glance. However, this committee oversees the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which has a primary role in regulating commodity markets, including derivatives. Many in the crypto space, particularly those dealing with assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum, argue that these are commodities, not securities. Therefore, the CFTC, under the purview of this committee, is a key player in determining their regulatory fate. The hearing aims to gather insights from a broad spectrum of stakeholders. This means we can expect representatives from: Crypto Industry: Exchanges, developers, blockchain companies, and advocacy groups. Financial Institutions: Banks, investment firms, and traditional finance players exploring digital assets. Consumer Protection Advocates: Groups focused on safeguarding investors and users. Academic Experts: Researchers and legal scholars specializing in digital assets and financial technology. Government Agencies: Though not directly testifying, their perspectives will certainly influence the discussions. The outcome of such a Senate Hearing could significantly impact how Digital Commodities are traded, custodied, and integrated into the broader financial system. Why is Clear Crypto Regulation So Crucial for US Crypto Policy? The current regulatory landscape for digital assets in the U.S. is often described as a patchwork, leading to confusion and uncertainty. This fragmented approach has hindered innovation for some and left investors vulnerable in other instances. The primary debate often centers around whether a digital asset is a security (under the SEC’s purview) or a commodity (under the CFTC’s). This lack of clarity creates significant challenges: Regulatory Arbitrage: Businesses may seek jurisdictions with more favorable or less stringent rules. Investor Protection Gaps: Without clear rules, consumers might not be adequately protected from fraud or market manipulation. Innovation Stifled: Companies may hesitate to develop new products or services due to uncertain legal frameworks. Market Instability: Unregulated markets can be more volatile and prone to sudden shifts. A unified and comprehensive approach to Crypto Regulation is essential for fostering a healthy, secure, and innovative digital asset ecosystem. This hearing is a vital step towards addressing these complexities and shaping a coherent US Crypto Policy that balances growth with consumer safety. Understanding the Landscape of Digital Asset Oversight The concept of Digital Asset Oversight extends beyond just classifying assets. It involves a holistic approach to managing risks, promoting innovation, and ensuring market integrity. This includes aspects like: Licensing and Registration: Determining which entities need to register with which regulators. Custody Rules: How digital assets are securely stored and managed. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC): Preventing illicit financial activities. Market Surveillance: Monitoring for manipulation and ensuring fair trading practices. Taxation: Clarifying how digital asset transactions are taxed. Each of these areas presents its own set of challenges and requires careful consideration. The stakeholders presenting at the hearing will likely bring diverse perspectives on how best to implement effective Digital Asset Oversight without stifling the nascent industry’s potential. The goal is to build a regulatory framework that supports legitimate innovation while weeding out bad actors and protecting everyday users. What Does This Mean for the Future of Digital Commodities? The hearing’s specific focus on “ Digital Commodities ” signals a recognition of their distinct nature from traditional securities. This distinction is crucial because it determines which regulatory body has primary jurisdiction and what rules apply. If a clear framework for digital commodities emerges, it could: Boost Institutional Adoption: Clarity encourages more traditional financial institutions to enter the space. Enhance Market Liquidity: Increased participation can lead to deeper and more stable markets. Facilitate New Products: Clear rules enable the development of regulated derivatives, ETFs, and other financial products. Reduce Legal Uncertainty: Companies operating with digital commodities would have a clearer path for compliance. The outcome of this hearing, and subsequent legislative efforts, will significantly influence how assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum are treated within the U.S. financial system. It could pave the way for more robust, regulated markets for Digital Commodities , benefiting both investors and the broader economy. Actionable Insights for Navigating US Crypto Policy Changes For individuals and businesses involved in the digital asset space, staying informed about evolving US Crypto Policy is paramount. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow legislative developments, regulatory announcements, and industry news closely. Resources like official government websites, reputable crypto news outlets, and industry analyses are invaluable. Engage with Policymakers: If you’re a business or an active participant, consider supporting advocacy groups that represent your interests. Your voice, collectively, can influence policy direction. Prepare for Compliance: Assume that more regulation is coming. Businesses should start reviewing their operations to ensure they can adapt to new compliance requirements related to licensing, AML, and reporting. Understand Your Assets: Know whether the digital assets you hold or deal with are likely to be classified as securities or commodities, as this dictates their regulatory treatment. Seek Expert Advice: Consult with legal and financial professionals who specialize in digital assets to navigate complex regulatory landscapes. The path to comprehensive US Crypto Policy is a marathon, not a sprint. This hearing is a significant milestone, but the journey will require ongoing dialogue, collaboration, and adaptation from all sides. A Defining Moment for Digital Assets The upcoming U.S. Senate hearing on Digital Asset Oversight on July 15 is more than just a procedural event; it’s a defining moment for the digital asset industry. By gathering diverse stakeholder perspectives on Digital Commodities , the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition & Forestry is taking a critical step towards establishing a clearer, more predictable framework for Crypto Regulation . The discussions held and the insights gained from this Senate Hearing will undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping future US Crypto Policy . While challenges remain, the commitment to open dialogue offers hope for a balanced regulatory environment that fosters innovation, protects consumers, and integrates digital assets into the mainstream financial system responsibly. The future of digital finance in the U.S. hangs in the balance, and this hearing is a testament to its growing importance.

As demand for privacy grows in the crypto space, no-KYC exchanges like StealthEX, ChangeHero, and Swapuz offer fast, anonymous swaps, but not without trade-offs. Table of Contents Why privacy matters, in crypto too No-KYC: Not a license for illicit activity How instant swap platforms function Review and comparison: StealthEX, ChangeHero, and Swapuz Choosing the right tool for the job In a world where privacy is a growing concern, many cryptocurrency users are actively seeking ways to manage their digital assets with more control over their personal data. While standard KYC procedures are common, the market offers platforms specifically designed for users prioritizing speed and anonymity for smaller transactions. Welcome to the world of no-KYC crypto exchanges. These services enable private crypto swaps, allowing users to exchange one digital currency for another with minimal personal information required upfront. Often referred to as anonymous crypto exchange options, it’s crucial to understand exactly how they operate and what their capabilities, and limitations, are. Why privacy matters, in crypto too At its heart, cryptocurrency was born from a vision of financial autonomy, the ability to transact peer-to-peer, free from traditional gatekeepers. For many, this includes the fundamental right to crypto privacy. It’s not just about hiding something; it’s about control over one’s financial identity in an increasingly transparent digital world. As the ecosystem matures, this core value hasn’t faded; instead, it fuels the demand for options that respect individual discretion, like those offered by a no-KYC crypto exchange. No-KYC: Not a license for illicit activity The label “no KYC crypto exchange” can be misleading. It’s easy to hear “no KYC” and jump to conclusions about platforms operating outside the law or being havens for illegal activity. That’s a significant distortion of how most reputable services in this space actually function. Understanding what “no-KYC” really means in the context of crypto is absolutely vital for anyone looking to use these platforms responsibly and effectively. What “No-KYC” typically means So, what is a no-KYC crypto exchange actually offering? At its core, the no KYC meaning crypto enthusiasts should grasp is about the onboarding process and transaction type, particularly for smaller amounts. Unlike heavyweight exchanges that demand passports, proof of address, and selfies before users can even make their first move, these platforms often allow users to perform an instant crypto swap with no KYC verification for certain transaction volumes. Why it’s NOT a free-for-all Now, let’s firmly address the idea that “no-KYC” means lawlessness. This is simply incorrect for legitimate operators. While they might skip the initial ID upload for small swaps, these platforms are not operating in a vacuum outside of no-KYC crypto regulations. They must adhere to the rules of the jurisdictions where they are based and serve users, which includes various crypto compliance measures. Asking “is no KYC crypto illegal?” misses the point; the legality depends less on the “no KYC” label itself and more on the platform’s actual compliance infrastructure and the user’s location and actions. Reputable services implement sophisticated systems behind the scenes. This includes monitoring transaction patterns for suspicious activity (a core part of AML CTF crypto protocols), setting transaction limits that trigger verification thresholds, analyzing IP addresses, and using blockchain analysis to trace funds potentially linked to illicit sources. If transactions raise red flags, these platforms can and often will request verification, block funds, or cooperate with law enforcement requests. The immutable nature of the blockchain actually makes it easier to trace transactions retrospectively than many traditional systems. How instant swap platforms function Forget the complex interfaces and order books of traditional exchanges for a moment. Think of these crypto exchange platforms more like a high-speed currency exchange window. But instead of a human counting cash, it’s advanced technology facilitating private crypto swaps instantly. So, how crypto swaps work on these sites is quite neat: Users initiate a trade, specify their wallet address, and send their crypto. Behind the scenes, the platform doesn’t keep the user’s coins sitting in an account. Instead, it quickly connects to various markets using a crypto liquidity aggregator, finds the best rate, executes the swap, and sends the converted crypto straight back to the user’s wallet. This non-custodial crypto exchange approach (during the swap itself) means assets spend minimal time under third-party control, prioritizing speed and ownership.

The market for confidential crypto swaps features several services, each with its own flavor. Here’s a deep dive into three prominent players: StealthEX, ChangeHero, and Swapuz, to break down exactly what they offer, how they feel to use, and where they stand apart. StealthEX review: The privacy-first powerhouse When users looking for a platform that puts anonymity front and center while still offering serious range, StealthEX exchange often comes up. It’s built around a non-custodial model, meaning they don’t hold onto funds any longer than necessary for the swap itself, a big plus for security and privacy advocates. StealthEX impresses with its sheer breadth, supporting well over 800 different cryptocurrencies. If users are trading more than just the major players and want to do it without jumping through extensive identity hoops, this platform offers one of the widest selections available. Using the platform is refreshingly simple. The interface guides users through a clear three-step process: pick coins, punch in the destination address, and hit exchange. It’s designed for speed and ease. While they don’t have a dedicated mobile app, the web experience is smooth. Typical swap times hovered between 5 to 30 minutes, depending on how busy the networks were. They use a floating rate system, which means the final rate might shift slightly from the initial estimate, but it generally tracks market movements closely. StealthEX keeps the barrier to entry low; users don’t even need an email address to swap, though providing one helps with notifications. Users can typically swap up to around $10,000 worth of crypto without triggering KYC. Just be aware that even below this, unusual activity could prompt a check. Should anyone need assistance, their customer support is available via live chat, email, and Telegram. Their help center covers the basics well, though some more complex scenarios might require direct support. Overall, StealthEX shines with its commitment to privacy, extensive coin support, and a user-friendly flow. However, keep an eye on the exchange rates; while transparent about their service fees, the rate they offer sometimes includes a slightly wider spread compared to other services, which can feel like an extra cost. ChangeHero review: The swift and streamlined swapper If speed and a truly beginner-friendly interface are top priorities for a no-KYC service, the ChangeHero cryptocurrency exchange aims to be the go-to. While it supports fewer cryptocurrencies than some rivals (around 300+), it covers all the major ones and plenty of popular altcoins. Where ChangeHero really stands out is its minimalist design. The interface is incredibly clean and intuitive, stripping away complexity to make the swapping process as painless as possible. Even if users have never used a swap service before, they can likely swap crypto on ChangeHero as the platform makes it easy within just a few minutes. The focus on speed isn’t just marketing; transactions are completed quickly, often within 5 to 15 minutes. They achieve this by tapping into various liquidity sources behind the scenes, helping maintain reliable execution. ChangeHero also gives users a choice between fixed and floating rates. If users want certainty on the exact amount they’ll receive, this is the option for them. Users can pick the fixed rate, though they should expect slightly higher fees for that guarantee. If they prefer the potential for a slightly better rate by taking on market fluctuation risks, they can go with the floating option. ChangeHero keeps its no-KYC limit conservative, typically around $5,000 equivalent per day before verification might be requested. While this limit is lower than StealthEX, their application of limits is more consistent, with fewer surprise checks for standard swaps below the threshold. Support is available via email, Telegram, and a ticket system, usually responding within a few hours. Their documentation is solid for core functions, reflecting their focus on simplicity. The big wins for ChangeHero are its incredibly user-friendly interface, reliable speed, and the valuable option of fixed-rate swaps. The main trade-off is a smaller selection of supported coins and a lower no-verification transaction limit compared to some competitors.

This dual nature gives it a unique reach and makes it accessible from numerous points across the web. Swapuz supports a respectable range of cryptocurrencies, around 500+, with a good emphasis on newer tokens and assets within the DeFi space alongside the established coins. From a user experience perspective, Swapuz leans more towards functionality than flashy design. The interface presents all the options clearly, which experienced users might appreciate for its directness. However, newcomers could potentially find it a bit less intuitive than the more streamlined designs of platforms like ChangeHero. Transaction speeds are a bit more variable, typically ranging from 10 to 30 minutes, and sometimes longer during peak network activity. Their fee structure is dynamic, adapting based on current network loads and the specific coins being swapped. This can mean competitive rates for popular pairs but potentially higher costs for less common exchanges. The embeddable widget is a key part of the Swapuz model, creating many different access points for users. While convenient, this can lead to slight inconsistencies in the overall user experience depending on how well the host website integrates the widget. For direct use, Swapuz generally allows transactions up to about $8,000 equivalent without requiring full KYC, sitting between StealthEX and ChangeHero in terms of this limit. They typically require email verification below this threshold but no further ID unless there’s a flag. Swapuz’s strengths lie in its broad availability through integrations, good support for a diverse range of tokens, and a competitive no-KYC limit. On the flip side, potential inconsistencies in the user experience (due to widget integration) and notably slower customer support response times (often taking 6-12 hours) are definite points to consider. Comparative analysis Pitting StealthEX vs ChangeHero vs Swapuz head-to-head in a no KYC exchange comparison reveals that there’s no single “best” platform; it truly depends on what users need most. This analysis breaks down how they stack up across the key factors users should consider when choosing the best no-KYC swap partner. StealthEX leads the pack with the highest stated standard no-KYC limit at roughly $10,000. Swapuz follows with an $8,000 limit, and ChangeHero has the lowest at (reportedly) $5,000. However, ChangeHero was the most consistent in adhering strictly to this limit, while both StealthEX and Swapuz seemed more likely to trigger verification based on transaction patterns rather than just the amount, even below their stated thresholds. If coin variety is king for the user, StealthEX is the clear winner with its extensive catalog of 800+ assets. Swapuz offers a solid 500+ coins, particularly good for emerging tokens, while ChangeHero focuses on the core with 300+ major and popular altcoins. When milliseconds matter, ChangeHero consistently delivered the fastest and most reliable swap times, typically completing transactions in 5-15 minutes. StealthEX was close behind at 5-30 minutes, but Swapuz showed the most variability, averaging 10-30 minutes with potential for delays during network congestion. ChangeHero offers the most straightforward fee experience, especially with its fixed-rate option providing cost certainty. Both StealthEX and Swapuz utilize more variable fee structures, which sometimes mean the cost is reflected more in a wider exchange rate spread than a clear upfront fee percentage. For newcomers or those who value simplicity above all else, ChangeHero’s ultra-clean interface is likely the easiest to navigate. StealthEX strikes a good balance suitable for intermediate users, while Swapuz’s more functional layout might resonate best with experienced crypto traders. StealthEX provided the fastest support responses across multiple channels. ChangeHero was reliable but slightly slower, while Swapuz’s support was notably less responsive, sometimes taking half a day or longer for email replies. So, which is the best no-KYC swap? Consider StealthEX if users need the highest standard no-KYC limits and access to a vast array of altcoins, prioritizing a wide selection alongside privacy. Opt for ChangeHero if users value lightning-fast transactions, a simple, intuitive interface (great for beginners), and the option of a guaranteed fixed exchange rate. Look into Swapuz if users frequently trade emerging tokens or if they interact with websites that already have the Swapuz widget integrated, and are comfortable with a more functional interface. Ultimately, these platforms serve slightly different niches within the no-KYC space. Choosing the right tool for the job No-KYC platforms offer a compelling path for those who prioritize privacy and speed in the crypto world. They function effectively as crypto privacy tools for straightforward asset exchanges, and options like StealthEX, ChangeHero, and Swapuz demonstrate the variety available. But remember, this doesn’t mean trading outside the bounds of the law. These services are best utilized by understanding their inherent limits and regulatory realities. Choosing the best no-KYC exchange means finding a balance that suits the user’s specific transaction habits while maintaining responsibility for compliance, particularly concerning taxes.

Price prediction for 2025 targets $1.74, with potential highs of $2.0 and $3.0. The Pi Network is making waves once again , as its price sees a sudden and powerful breakout backed by real-world developments and renewed investor confidence. With increased activity on major exchanges, rumors of Pi Coin Binance listing , and global adoption efforts, Pi is becoming one of the most-watched tokens in the Crypto market. Global interest in Pi Coin price is surging, especially in regions like India and Pakistan, where users are actively searching for “1 Pi to PKR in 2025” and “Pi Network price in India in the future.” Table of contents Overview Pi Coin Price Targets July 2025 Pi Network Price Prediction 2025 Pi Coin Price Targets 2026 – 2030 Pi Crypto Price Forecast 2026 Pi Coin Price Prediction 2027 Pi Token Price Projection 2028 Pi Network Price Analysis 2029 Pi Network Price Prediction 2030 Market Analysis Coinpedia’s PI Coin Price Prediction Conclusion FAQs Overview Cryptocurrency Pi Token PI Price $ 0.46178591 1.06% Market cap $ 3,539,675,527.5008 Circulating Supply 7,665,187,323.7529 Trading Volume $ 56,272,280.5700 All-time high $2.98 on 26th February 2025 All-time low $0.6152 on 20th February 2025 Pi Coin Price Targets July 2025 In July 2025, PI crypto is strongly attempting to hold the critical $0.45 level. If this positive momentum continues, there is potential for a retest of the $0.66 mark within the month. Successfully maintaining a position above this level by breaking through the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands would indicate a Change of Character (ChoCh) in the prevailing bearish trend. Following such a shift, the price could advance to retest the Fibonacci 0.5 level, situated around $1.65-$1.70, either in July or Q3. On the contrary, if it slips more, it could collapse back to $0.400 again; this time, if the fall extends, a new low is possible. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Pi Crypto Price Forecast July 2025 $0.85 $2.25 $3.50 Pi Network Price Prediction 2025 In mid-May, the weighted sentiment for PI crypto surged to “+2.86,” a significant rebound from Q2’s low of “-1.76.” This shift indicated that positive sentiment was three times greater than negative sentiment, largely fueled by rumors of a Binance listing, which drove substantial price increases. The bullish momentum propelled the price toward the $1.68 mark, acting like a magnet. However, this level was also recognized as a supply zone, meaning it would require intense buying pressure to break through and maintain a position above it. A daily close above this level was essential. Unfortunately, the price peaked at $1.65 but ultimately closed around $1.20, resulting in a nearly 30% drawdown in gains on the same day. This sharp decline was attributed to a wave of profit-taking, which caused the weighted sentiment to shift from positive to negative. From May’s peak to the second week of July, the total losses amounted to nearly 72%. However, in the past few days of July, bullish sentiment has begun to emerge, with PI crypto fighting to hold the $0.45 level. If this bullish sentiment continues to build, PI could retest the $0.66 mark in July. Sustaining above this level by breaking through the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands would signify a Change of Character (ChoCh) in the current bearish trend. Following a ChoCh, the price might advance to retest the Fibonacci 0.5 level, which lies around $1.65-$1.70, either in July or Q3. Under extremely bullish conditions, if PI manages to surpass the 0.5 Fibonacci level, which is closely aligned with a “fixed range volume profile-tool based level,” then odds are higher for higher targets of $2.00 and $3.00 could become attainable later in 2025. However, this potential hinges on the success of utility-driven programs and increased adoption. On the flip side, if the price slips further, it could fall back to the $0.400 mark. Should the decline extend beyond that, a new low could be on the horizon.

This strategic move brings part of the $GUN token’s circulating supply to Solana, enhancing accessibility for U.S. (and global) users while reinforcing GUNZ’s leadership in the blockchain gaming sector. On the 10th of July $GUN lands on Solana, bringing lightning-fast access and next-gen infrastructure to a whole new wave of gamers and community members. Strategic Alignment with Solana: A Multi-Chain Vision Under the bold banner, “$GUN is Coming to Solana,” GUNZ is embracing Solana’s high-speed, low-cost blockchain infrastructure and robust ecosystem to amplify its multi-chain strategy, aptly summarized as “Too Big for One Chain.” This move represents the latest step in a clear multichain strategy, setting the stage for additional expansions to other prominent blockchains in the future. The bridging process to Solana will be facilitated by LayerZero, a leader in blockchain interoperability and seamless cross-chain transactions. Currently, $GUN is available on multiple blockchains and platforms, including GUNZ Layer 1 and AVAX C-chain. This alignment radically increases accessibility to the token and unlocks new opportunities for partnerships, campaigns, and community engagement by leveraging Solana’s global reach. To celebrate this milestone, GUNZ will launch a limited-edition Solana-themed NFT content pack. Details on how to claim this exclusive offering will be announced soon, adding excitement for the growing Off The Grid community. Off The Grid and the GUNZ Ecosystem: A Clarified Vision GUNZ is renowned for Off The Grid, the first AAA game with an onchain economy, available across platforms like Epic Games Store, Xbox, PlayStation, and soon Steam. Within OTG, the $GUN token serves as a utility token, enabling players to purchase in-game items, engage in asset trading, and participate in blockchain-powered gameplay interactions. Following the Solana integration, players will be able to deposit Solana-based $GUN directly into their in-game wallet, enabling fast, reliable, and convenient transactions within OTG’s immersive digital economy. With over 17 million wallets registered in the GUNZ ecosystem, GUNZ is poised for strong growth. This milestone will boost ecosystem activity and token utility. Leadership Perspective “Launching $GUN on Solana reflects our long-term commitment to building a truly global, player-first ecosystem,” said Vlad Korolov, CEO at Gunzilla Games. “Solana’s speed and scalability allow us to reach new communities with greater efficiency and reliability. This is more than a technical upgrade—it’s a major step toward making blockchain gaming seamless, inclusive, and ready for the mainstream.” Looking Ahead GUNZ is set to share additional updates in the coming weeks, including details on the highly anticipated Steam release of Off The Grid and further global token availability. As the ecosystem gears up for mass adoption, the crypto community is encouraged to stay tuned for announcements that will solidify GUNZ’s position as a trailblazer in blockchain gaming.

The investment underscores strong confidence in The Open Platform’s continued development of the blockchain ecosystem in Telegram, being built on TON. The involvement of prominent investors and the raised capital will support the launch of TOP’s portfolio companies across the U.S., EU, and other key regions. The Open Platform , the leading tech company developing TON-based innovations in Telegram, has announced the completion of its Series A and subsequent extension funding rounds, reaching a $1 billion valuation and becoming the first unicorn in the TON-based ecosystem in Telegram. The Open Platform raised $28.5 million in an extended Series A funding round, led by Ribbit Capital, with Pantera Capital also participating. Including this latest raise and previous seed investments, The Open Platform has now secured over $70 million in total funding. These investments demonstrate the confidence that leading investors have in The Open Platform’s ability to spearhead the growth of the blockchain ecosystem in Telegram. This ecosystem is being built on TON Blockchain – a fully decentralized and highly scalable blockchain that is the exclusive blockchain partner of Telegram Messenger. The current strategic focus of The Open Platform centers on geographical expansion. The involvement of prominent investors, along with the newly raised capital, will support the launch of TOP’s portfolio companies across the U.S., EU, and other key regions — in alignment with TON Foundation’s global vision. This expansion will involve significant investment in go-to-market strategies, regulatory licensing, compliance infrastructure, and security enhancements, all aimed at ensuring sustainable growth and long-term success in these new jurisdictions. Andrew Rogozov, CEO and Founder of The Open Platform, said, “This investment supports our long-term strategy to scale the adoption of blockchain-based products by leveraging the power of Telegram as a distribution channel. By combining TON Blockchain with Telegram’s global reach, we’re building both the infrastructure and the consumer-facing apps needed to onboard a billion users to crypto.” The Open Platform is driving the growth of the TON-based ecosystem within Telegram, building both core infrastructure and consumer-facing apps across finance, gaming, and entertainment.

By integrating blockchain technology into everyday digital experience, The Open Platform is creating a seamless, scalable platform designed for a billion users, accelerating the mainstream adoption of crypto — expanding global access to financial services, and enabling a new generation of builders and developers to build the next wave of consumer dApps. This latest investment from Ribbit Capital, which has previously provided early-stage investment to Coinbase, Nubank, and Revolut, amongst many others, and Pantera Capital, is a testament to the potential these investors see in the integration of blockchain technology into a messenger application with over a billion users. Micky Malka, Founder of Ribbit Capital, said, ""We back teams that reimagine how the world experiences money and technology. The Open Platform’s vision of building an intuitive and open platform that enables a robust digital ecosystem to form within Telegram — a platform used by hundreds of millions — opens a new frontier of opportunities for builders and users on a global scale.” “We’re thrilled to back this exceptional team led by Andrew. The opportunity to support groundbreaking tech and financial products that reach 1 billion people is inspiring,"" said Ryan Barney, Partner at Pantera Capital. ”We’re excited to collaborate with the TOP team and strengthen our commitment to TON and Telegram’s ecosystems.” TON Blockchain has been the subject of increased institutional interest throughout this year. In March, TON Foundation announced that several leading investors, including Sequoia Capital, Ribbit Capital, Benchmark, Draper Associates, Kingsway, Vy Capital, Libertus Capital, CoinFund, SkyBridge, Hypersphere, and Karatage, have acquired and now hold $400 million worth of Toncoin, signaling growing interest in the TON-based ecosystem in Telegram.

The project is backed by institutional investors including Jump and CMT Digital. Today, Cooking.City fully launched, revealing its core mechanisms and points system to better align incentives between traders and developers while creating new ways to participate in on-chain launches. Bringing Back Value Redistribution to Solana Fair Launches Cooking.City is more than just another launchpad. It is a community-first platform focused on value redistribution instead of value extraction. With Referral System, Cooking.City shares platform revenues with users. Referrers earn fee rebates and points based on their invitees’ trading activities. As the only launchpad which hasn't launched its official token, Cooking.City aims to attract early users through highly-anticipated airdrops, encouraging interaction between traders and quality token launches. Users can check the rules of rewards and point history on the dashboard every day. Top referrers and traders will receive significant reward multipliers to further amplify their future rewards. Cooking Points: A Multi-Layered Incentive System The Cooking Points system is now live. It rewards users who actively engage with the platform across multiple dimensions. Trading on Cooking.City: Higher trading volumes bring more points. And high market cap with healthy trading volume tokens are designated as Michelin Tokens, and trading them can offer bonus points multipliers. Referrals: Users can share referral codes and earn up to 10x points multipliers based on referred users’ trading activity. Social Quests: Liking, commenting, sharing official tweets, or using the #CookingCity tag unlocks additional point rewards. Each user has a personal dashboard that updates daily. Points are retroactively calculated based on activity since launch and will be tied directly to future airdrop events. Conviction Pool: A Capital-based Launch Feature to Signify Good Launch Cooking.City’s Conviction Pool is a new mechanism that holds developers accountable and helps traders to tell quality launches from random ones. Developer Commitment: To opt in, developers can choose to deposit some SOL and set a price that signals their conviction in the token. Soft Price Protection: If the token graduates, the conviction pool will activate. If the price drops to a set level, users can swap their bought tokens into SOL from the conviction pool, acting like an insurance, establishing benchmarks for quality in the market. If the price does not fall below the set level, the developer can claim back the SOL from the conviction pool. This design filters out low-effort launches, protects traders, and signals serious commitment from builders. The Birthplace of Onchain Conviction Cooking.City is creating a marketplace of convictions, allowing builders and investors to actualize and capture their faith through launches and trading. The launchpad is the first step towards its greater on-chain nation, effectively allowing more convicted projects to enter crypto through Cooking.City. The team expects to diversify approaches of asset issuance and capital matchmaking through their evolving launch infrastructure and mechanisms. About Cooking.City Cooking.City is a pioneering platform designed to revolutionize token fair launches. By aligning values between builders, believers, and traders, Cooking.City creates new opportunities to reward quality launches and early support on token projects, encouraging builders and investors to grow together.

ROFL bridges a critical gap in Web3: how to run intensive workloads, such as AI model training, inference, and data analysis, without sacrificing decentralization or trust. With ROFL, developers can execute resource-intensive operations off-chain within secure enclaves, then cryptographically verify and connect the results back to smart contracts on-chain, unlocking entirely new use cases across the AI and blockchain landscape. “When we think about the future of our digital world, consumers will continue to value convenience and ease of use over anything,” said Jernej Kos, co-founder of Oasis Protocol Foundation. “Which is why it’s critical for developers to focus on building applications that already have privacy and transparency built into their infrastructure. ROFL is a production-ready platform that will serve as plug-and-play infrastructure for building the next wave of AI applications.” Early Builders on ROFL Are Already Redefining What’s Possible Two standout projects already building on ROFL underscore the platform’s versatility: Zeph , a privacy-first AI companion platform, utilizes ROFL to maintain user data confidentiality through trusted execution environments. In a space plagued by security concerns, a 2023 study in the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine found 74% of companion apps posed ""Critical"" or ""High"" security risks. Zeph ensures sensitive data remains protected and verifiable. WT3 , an autonomous AI agent for decentralized trading strategies, is leveraging ROFL to deliver fully private, trustless key management and trade execution. The project is funded with $100,000 in seed capital from the Oasis Protocol Foundation to accelerate development. And the pipeline is just getting started. ROFL is designed to support a wide variety of future products, including game hosting, MCP servers, LLM oracles, price oracles, AI-powered chatbots, and more. ROFL: A “Trustless AWS” for AI Applications What sets ROFL apart is its integration with the Oasis TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) Cloud, a robust infrastructure offering developers a full end-to-end TEE-as-a-Service. This makes ROFL the “Trustless AWS” for AI applications, a white-label compute layer where developers can deploy powerful services with built-in privacy, trust, and scalability. By combining blockchain’s integrity with the processing power of offchain computation, ROFL offers a breakthrough solution to two of today’s biggest tech challenges: the blockchain ecosystem’s limited application layer and AI’s pervasive trust issues. Builders can start exploring how to leverage ROFL at the oasis.net/rofl-deck . About Oasis Protocol Foundation Oasis Protocol Foundation is a steward of Oasis Network, a Layer 1 blockchain platform focused on privacy, scalability, and versatility. It offers the first production-ready confidential EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), Sapphire, enabling privacy-preserving smart contracts and decentralized applications. The network is expanding its focus to include AI applications, positioning itself at the intersection of blockchain, privacy, and artificial intelligence.

Samson Mow Reveals Shocking Scenario,https://coinpedia.org/news/bitcoin-to-1-million-in-months-samson-mow-reveals-shocking-scenario/,"The post Bitcoin to $1 Million in Months? Samson Mow Reveals Shocking Scenario appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a positive update from Samson Mow, the vocal CEO of JAN3 and a Bitcoin advocate. He reveals a delightful prediction: Bitcoin could soar to $1 million per coin in a matter of weeks to months. In a recent interview , Mow outlined his concept of “hyperbitcoinization,” a transformative change in which Bitcoin emerges as a fundamental element of the global financial system. As fiat currencies jiggle and countries are coining forward to adopt crypto, Mow’s vision is enchanting both investors and skeptics. The $1 Million Bitcoin Scenario Explained Mow’s prediction relies on a sudden and steep increase, rather than a gradual rise. He describes the rise as a “brief and fierce surge” that might push Bitcoin’s worth to $1 million. “ They don’t gradually fail, they fail spectacularly “, Mow stated, citing fiat currencies, indicating the increasing global economic turmoil. With inflation reducing faith in traditional currency, Bitcoin’s decentralized features place it as a refuge, placing its worth at unmatched levels. Hyperbitcoinization: Governments Quietly Joining In Mow believes governments are already preparing for this shift. One example he gave is Bhutan, which has been mining Bitcoin since 2019. Today, its Bitcoin holdings are reportedly worth close to one trillion dollars – a signal, he says, that hyperbitcoinization is already underway. Violent upheaval is the most likely scenario. #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/Ibk5qtOVgi — Samson Mow (@Excellion) July 8, 2025 Countries with abundant energy resources are in a unique position, Mow explained. They can use their excess energy to mine Bitcoin, boost their reserves, and use the funds to pay down debt or support national projects. This, he believes, could help some nations stabilize their economies while shifting toward a Bitcoin-based financial model. Bitcoin Bonds Could Redefine Sovereign Debt Mow also sees a future where governments begin issuing Bitcoin-backed sovereign debt. This could lead to a new kind of global Bitcoin Bond market. He pointed to MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor, whose company has used Bitcoin to raise funds successfully. That strategy, Mow said, could soon be adopted by countries. “It’s simply a matter of time before every country pulls that trigger,” Mow asserted. If that happens, Bitcoin’s demand and price could rise sharply, pushing it toward that $1 million mark. What’s Next for Bitcoin? With global uncertainty growing and more governments exploring Bitcoin, Mow’s vision of hyperbitcoinization may not be far off. If countries begin using Bitcoin to back their reserves or issue debt, the cryptocurrency could shift from being just an investment to becoming a core part of the global economy. Whether Bitcoin hits $1 million remains to be seen but the pieces, according to Mow, are already falling into place.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-09 09:57:39

However, regulatory concerns over transaction privacy could affect its long-term viability, potentially impacting ZK protocols like $MANTA. Overall, Manta is a good investment if you want a profitable return in the long term. Why is the Manta price up today? Manta price has triggered a strong bullish rally toward $0.189. This occurred after buyers gained confidence and accumulated heavily around $0.17. Will Manta price recover? If bulls hold the price above $0.2, we might see further recovery toward immediate resistance channels. Will Manta price reach $10? In recent months, the Manta network expanded its offerings and established multiple partnerships. If buying demand continues to increase in the coming years, its price might surpass the $10 mark. Will Manta reach $100? Depending on the current market sentiment, the MNT price might take several years to reach the $100 milestone. We expect the Manta price to achieve $100 by 2060. Will Manta reach $1000? $1000 is a distant dream for Manta price. However, if everything remains in favor of the altcoin market, we might even see the MNT price hitting $1K. Is Manta a good long-term investment? Investors are bullish on Manta, which has gained significant attention in recent months. If developers continue to build robust utilities for Manta and the roadmap fulfills user demand, it can be a good long-term investment option. Recent MANTA news/ opinions Kenny Li, one of the co-founders of Manta Network, was recently almost tricked by a phishing scam carried out by the well-known hacking group Lazarus.

In his reading, Ethereum Classic completed its fifth impulsive wave during the last cycle, whereas Cardano is “waiting on that fifth wave” after a prolonged flag-shaped consolidation. He then dropped a Fibonacci retracement on Ethereum Classic’s 2020–21 third-to-fourth-wave segment, showing the final thrust topped out “just shy of the 2.36”—and repeated the exercise on Cardano’s current structure, which has advanced to the same proportional level. “Come on, it’s not perfect,” he conceded, “but you guys see how similar these structures are.” A second Fibonacci projection, stretching Cardano’s initial three-wave span to a full 1.618 extension, points to a conservative target “up around four bucks,” he said. But a more ambitious extrapolation of Ethereum Classic’s 3.618 climax would propel ADA into a zone between roughly 10.67 and 12.55—an area he calls his “primary” and “secondary” objectives. From the current price such a run would exceed 2,000 percent. “That’s violent,” he remarked after flicking his cursor to the comparative surge on the ETC chart. “Hopefully you can see how clean this is, because I feel really good about Cardano getting up into that $10 level.” Related Reading: Cardano (ADA) Turns Upward — Signs of a Recovery Emerge Quantum Ascend argued that the temporal spacing is also lining up. Ethereum Classic’s listing in August 2016 meant its multiyear base completed roughly four and a half years later; Cardano’s analogous base, begun in late 2017, is now of similar duration, though “the whole chart has taken a little bit longer on the consolidation.” For him, that extension merely “loads the spring” for a sharper repricing once last season begins in earnest. The analyst did allow for interim turbulence. In his scenario, ADA could hit the former all-time-high region around $3.12, “reject back down to $1.67” during a broader market-wide wave-four shake-out, and only then launch into a blow-off toward the upper Fibonacci cluster. Still, even that corrective loop reinforces the fractal: “Over here with Ethereum Classic it got to its last all-time high, rejected, and then went on one more big run.” Related Reading: Cardano Price Woes To Continue? Analyst Expects ADA To Fall To $0.47 Quantifying his own risk appetite, Quantum Ascend told viewers he is “pretty hyped on Cardano” and wants the token “in my portfolio because it is one of my higher-conviction plays for what’s about to happen here.” He concluded by sketching three tiers of price objectives—$4.90 (conservative), $10.67 (primary) and $12.45 (secondary). Whether altseason’s starting gun fires as cleanly as the fractal implies remains to be seen, but Quantum Ascend’s thesis hinges on a single proposition: when the same market makers move two historically linked assets through mirror-image patterns, ignoring the setup may prove costlier than betting against it. At press time, ADA traded at $0.59.

A U.S. federal judge has made a pivotal ruling, potentially reshaping the prosecution’s strategy in the high-profile trial of developer Roman Storm. This decision not only highlights the complex interplay between innovation and regulation but also raises crucial questions about digital privacy and government oversight in the blockchain era. The Whirlwind of Tornado Cash and Its Legal Battle For those new to the space, Tornado Cash is a decentralized cryptocurrency mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to deposit crypto from one address and withdraw it to another, making it difficult to trace the flow of funds. While proponents argue it’s a vital tool for financial privacy, critics, including government agencies, contend it has been exploited by bad actors for illicit activities, including money laundering and sanctions evasion. The mixer gained notoriety when the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC) took the unprecedented step of sanctioning the protocol itself in August 2022. This move sparked widespread debate, with many in the crypto community viewing it as an overreach, arguing that sanctioning a piece of code was a dangerous precedent for open-source software and digital freedom. Who is Roman Storm and Why Does This Matter So Much? At the heart of this legal battle is Roman Storm , one of the co-founders and developers of Tornado Cash. He, along with fellow developer Roman Semenov, was indicted by U.S. prosecutors on charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business, and conspiracy to commit sanctions violations. The charges allege that Storm and his co-conspirators knew Tornado Cash was being used to launder funds from cybercrimes, including those perpetrated by the North Korean state-sponsored hacking group, Lazarus Group. The trial of Roman Storm is not just about one individual; it’s a litmus test for the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The outcome could set a powerful precedent for how developers of privacy-enhancing technologies are treated under existing financial regulations. If developers can be held liable for how their code is used by third parties, it could stifle innovation and push privacy tools further underground. Understanding the Nuances of OFAC Sanctions and Their Evolution The sanctions imposed by OFAC on Tornado Cash in August 2022 were a landmark event. They effectively prohibited U.S. persons from interacting with the mixer’s smart contracts, leading to significant disruption and legal challenges. However, the legal landscape surrounding these sanctions has been anything but static. In a critical development that predates the current ruling, a Texas court in March 2024 deemed OFAC’s sanctions against Tornado Cash unlawful. This decision came from a lawsuit filed by crypto advocacy group Coin Center and several individuals, arguing that OFAC exceeded its authority by sanctioning a decentralized, immutable software protocol rather than a person or entity. This ruling provided a significant, albeit separate, legal challenge to OFAC’s actions. It’s important to distinguish between the Texas court’s ruling on the legality of the sanctions and Judge Katherine Polk Failla’s recent decision in the Roman Storm trial, which pertains to the admissibility of evidence . While both touch upon the sanctions, they address different legal aspects and contexts. The US Court Ruling : What Does It Really Mean for the Trial? The latest US court ruling by Judge Katherine Polk Failla is a significant win for the defense. She has ruled that the U.S. Treasury Department’s OFAC sanctions against Tornado Cash cannot be introduced as evidence in the upcoming trial of Roman Storm . This means prosecutors cannot simply point to the existence of the sanctions as proof of Storm’s alleged intent or knowledge of illicit activity. Judge Failla’s rationale is crucial: any mention of the sanctions will be barred unless prosecutors can provide “compelling evidence” related to Storm’s conduct after the sanctions took effect. The burden is now on the prosecution to demonstrate that Storm’s actions, specifically after August 2022, somehow constituted an intent to violate sanctions or facilitate money laundering, independent of the mere existence of the sanctions themselves. Prosecutors have been given a deadline to submit such material. This ruling significantly complicates the prosecution’s case. Without being able to easily present the sanctions as a key part of their narrative, they will need to rely more heavily on other forms of evidence to prove Storm’s criminal intent and knowledge. It could force them to present a more direct link between Storm’s specific actions and the alleged illicit use of Tornado Cash, rather than relying on the broad legal declaration of the protocol as sanctioned. Key takeaways from the ruling: Exclusion of Sanctions Evidence: The OFAC sanctions themselves cannot be presented as evidence of Storm’s guilt. Focus on Post-Sanction Conduct: Prosecutors must prove Storm’s actions after August 2022 demonstrated intent to violate sanctions. Increased Burden on Prosecution: The prosecution now faces a higher bar to establish criminal intent without relying on the broad sanction designation. Potential for Precedent: While specific to this trial’s evidence, it underscores the judiciary’s careful approach to novel crypto cases. The Future of Crypto Mixer Services: A Delicate Balancing Act This US court ruling has profound implications for the broader landscape of crypto mixer services and privacy-enhancing technologies. It highlights the ongoing tension between regulatory efforts to combat illicit finance and the fundamental right to financial privacy. On one hand, regulators worldwide are grappling with how to oversee decentralized tools that can be used for both legitimate privacy and nefarious activities. The concern is that mixers can provide an anonymity layer for criminals, making it harder to track and recover stolen funds or prevent terrorist financing. On the other hand, privacy advocates argue that mixers are essential for protecting legitimate users’ financial anonymity, especially in an era where blockchain transactions are transparent by default. For individuals living under oppressive regimes, whistleblowers, or simply those who wish to keep their financial activities private from public scrutiny, mixers offer a vital service. The legal challenges faced by Tornado Cash and Roman Storm serve as a stark reminder of the regulatory uncertainty that still plagues the crypto space. While this specific ruling is a win for the defense on an evidentiary point, it doesn’t resolve the larger debate about the legality or regulatory status of mixers themselves. It merely refines the parameters under which developers can be prosecuted. What does this mean for developers and users? For developers of privacy tools, this case underscores the immense legal risks involved, even if their intentions are benign. It may lead to more caution in how such protocols are designed and operated, potentially incorporating more compliance features or restricting access to certain jurisdictions. For users, the message is mixed. While the ruling might offer a glimmer of hope for digital privacy advocates, the regulatory spotlight on mixers remains intense. Users of such services must remain aware of the evolving legal landscape and potential risks associated with their use. A Glimmer of Hope or Just a Detour? The exclusion of OFAC sanctions evidence in the Roman Storm trial is undeniably a significant moment. It demonstrates that the courts are willing to scrutinize the government’s approach to prosecuting crypto developers and that broad declarations by regulatory bodies may not automatically translate into admissible evidence in a criminal trial. This could provide a vital defense strategy for Storm and potentially influence future cases involving similar technologies. However, it’s crucial to remember that this is just one battle in a much larger war. The fundamental questions about the legal status of decentralized protocols, the liability of their developers, and the balance between privacy and illicit finance remain unanswered. The outcome of the Roman Storm trial will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications, shaping not only the future of crypto mixers but also the broader regulatory framework for decentralized technologies worldwide. The crypto community will be watching closely as this pivotal case unfolds.

The SEC’s request for revised S-1 filings, including adjustments for in-kind redemptions and staking, signals potential approval progress, boosting investor confidence. Rising decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes, which hit $64 billion, and growing DeFi activity on Solana (SOL)’s blockchain further support the bullish sentiment, despite short-term technical resistance around $152-$159. While traditional traders eye a 1.5x move from here, crypto speculators with an appetite for larger gains are setting their sights elsewhere—on a low-cap DeFi token that’s still flying under the radar: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . At just $0.03 per token in Phase 5 of its presale, with over $11.90 million raised, more than 12,900 holders, and 65% of its allocation already sold, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has positioned itself as one of the most promising early-stage protocols in the DeFi arena. Unlike high-cap tokens hoping for incremental gains, MUTM is drawing attention with forecasts of a 10x return, underpinned by real, usable lending infrastructure—not speculation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Delivers What DeFi Was Supposed to Be Forget empty buzzwords. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just another token—it’s a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol that enables users to lend, borrow, or even act as liquidators in a permissionless system. At the center of this ecosystem lies a user-first design that requires overcollateralization for all loans—whether issued in a Peer-to-Contract (P2C) or Peer-to-Peer (P2P) format. To manage risk and protect liquidity providers, the protocol evaluates every loan with a Stability Factor—a dynamic metric that compares the collateral value to the borrowed amount. If collateral drops too far, Mutuum will automatically initiate a liquidation. Liquidators will then buy the debt at a discount, protecting the system from bad debt and keeping it solvent. This structure is particularly important in volatile crypto environments where lender safety is often overlooked. Utility, Yield, and the 10x Horizon Unlike SOL, where much of the recent excitement stems from ETFs and institutional rumors, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has committed to deliver value directly to individual users. The protocol will offer mtTokens, which represent a user’s deposit in the system. For every asset you supply, you will receive an equal amount of mtTokens—mtSOL, for instance, when you deposit SOL. These tokens accrue interest automatically, reflecting your growing share in the liquidity pool. Lending will be simple and profitable. Users who deposit $15,000 in SOL, and at an estimated 15% APY (based on pool utilization), your mtSOL will be worth $17,250 after one year. For those seeking passive income beyond interest, MUTM goes a step further. The protocol plans to use part of its revenue to buy MUTM tokens from the market and redistribute them to users who stake their mtTokens in the designated contracts. This means that the participants benefit from the protocol’s success in more ways than one. Beyond yield, the roadmap is equally ambitious. The team is preparing to release a beta version of the platform by token launch, allowing users to immediately explore lending, borrowing, and the stablecoin infrastructure. This early access gives investors a head start in a space where timing matters. For early adopters, there’s a limited-time $100,000 giveaway in progress—ten winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. Mutuum is also building a decentralized stablecoin, pegged to $1, and only minted when collateral is supplied—such as ETH. Interest rates on this stablecoin will be governed by the protocol, fine-tuned to keep its price stable using dynamic adjustments and arbitrage pressure. To ensure accessibility and speed, Mutuum is leveraging Layer-2 integration, minimizing gas fees and solving major friction points seen across DeFi platforms. Combined with its clean tokenomics—4 billion total supply—and third-party security validation via CertiK, Mutuum delivers the confidence serious users need. The CertiK audit included both manual review and static analysis, awarding the project a Token Scan Score of 95.00 and a Skynet Score of 77. That, plus a growing social base with over 10,000 Twitter followers, signals that the Mutuum community is expanding fast—and organically. While Solana (SOL) might be the current favorite among institutional traders banking on ETF-driven momentum, its ceiling looks increasingly modest. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at a much earlier stage, offering direct utility, real DeFi function, and a 10x trajectory backed by responsible lending mechanics and protocol-driven value. With 60% already booked for this stage at just $0.03 per token, the entry point is hard to beat—and the upside even harder to ignore.

Imagine a scenario where building a simple, non-custodial software tool could land you in legal hot water with the U.S. government. That’s precisely the challenge blockchain developer Michael Lewellen is facing, and it’s why a powerful coalition of Crypto Advocacy groups has stepped in to support him. This isn’t just about one developer; it’s about setting a precedent for innovation, open-source development, and the very spirit of decentralization. The Crucial DOJ Lawsuit Against a DeFi Developer At the heart of this unfolding drama is a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) against Michael Lewellen. The DOJ’s argument centers on the assertion that Lewellen’s actions, specifically in building certain non-custodial decentralized finance (DeFi) tools, fall under the purview of money transmission laws. This is where the legal waters get murky. Lewellen’s tools are designed to be open-source and non-custodial, meaning they don’t hold users’ funds or act as intermediaries in transactions. They are, in essence, software programs that facilitate direct peer-to-peer interactions on a blockchain. However, the DOJ appears to be interpreting Section 1960 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, which pertains to unlicensed money transmitting businesses, in a way that broadens its scope to include developers of such software. This aggressive stance by the DOJ has prompted a significant response from the crypto industry. A formidable coalition, including prominent entities like crypto investment firm Paradigm, the DeFi Education Fund, the Blockchain Association, and the Crypto Council for Innovation, has filed an amicus brief. An amicus brief, or ‘friend of the court’ brief, allows parties not directly involved in a case to provide information, expertise, or insight that bears on the issues in the case. In this instance, it’s a powerful statement of industry solidarity and a clear warning against what they perceive as regulatory overreach. Why Are Crypto Advocacy Groups Stepping In? The involvement of these influential Crypto Advocacy groups underscores the gravity of the situation. Their primary motivation is to protect the fundamental principles of open-source development and decentralized innovation. They argue that the DOJ’s interpretation of money transmission laws is fundamentally flawed when applied to developers who create non-custodial software. Here’s why their intervention is so critical: Protecting Innovation: If developers can be held liable for simply writing and publishing code that others might use for financial transactions, it creates an immense chilling effect on innovation. This case could deter talented individuals from building the next generation of decentralized applications. Clarifying Legal Boundaries: The current legal landscape for crypto is notoriously ambiguous. These groups aim to bring much-needed clarity, advocating for regulations that distinguish between actual money transmitters and developers who merely create software tools. Preventing Regulatory Overreach: The coalition believes the DOJ is misapplying existing laws in a way that stretches their original intent. They argue that Section 1960 was designed for entities that act as financial intermediaries, not for software developers. Ensuring Economic Competitiveness: If the U.S. becomes a hostile environment for open-source crypto development, it risks pushing talent and innovation offshore, undermining its position as a leader in technological advancement. Their collective voice represents a significant portion of the crypto ecosystem, emphasizing the industry’s commitment to responsible innovation while pushing back against what they see as an arbitrary expansion of regulatory power. Protecting Innovation: The Impact on Open-Source Software and DeFi The core of the legal debate revolves around the nature of Open-Source Software . Unlike traditional software, open-source code is publicly accessible, allowing anyone to inspect, modify, and distribute it. This collaborative model has been a cornerstone of technological progress, fostering transparency and rapid development. Lewellen’s DeFi tools exemplify this ethos. The concern is that if the DOJ successfully labels open-source developers as money transmitters, it could fundamentally alter how open-source projects are developed and shared. Developers might become hesitant to contribute to projects that could be deemed ‘financial,’ even if their role is purely technical and non-custodial. This would stifle the very collaborative spirit that makes open-source so powerful. Consider the analogy: should the creator of a hammer be held liable if someone uses that hammer to commit a crime? The crypto advocacy groups argue that a developer creating a non-custodial tool is akin to the hammer creator – they provide a tool, but do not control its use or the funds involved. The DOJ’s stance threatens to create a precedent where merely providing code, even without any control over user funds, could lead to severe legal consequences, including imprisonment. Decoding Money Transmission Laws : Section 1960 and Its Misapplication To fully grasp the stakes, it’s essential to understand the specific legal provision at play: Section 1960 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code. This federal statute prohibits operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Typically, this law targets entities that facilitate the transfer of money on behalf of others, often for a fee, and are required to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The crux of the argument from the crypto advocacy groups is that the DOJ is misapplying this law. They contend that Lewellen’s tools, being non-custodial and open-source, do not fit the definition of a ‘money transmitting business’ because: No Custody of Funds: Lewellen’s tools do not take possession or control of users’ funds at any point. Transactions occur directly between users on the blockchain. No Intermediation: The tools are automated software; they do not act as human intermediaries or decision-makers in the transfer of value. Passive Code vs. Active Business: They argue there’s a critical distinction between writing and publishing code (a passive act) and actively operating a business that transmits money for others. The implications of the DOJ’s broad interpretation are profound. It could mean that anyone who contributes code to a DeFi protocol, even if they are not involved in its operation or profit from its use, could be deemed an unlicensed money transmitter. This interpretation could extend to core developers, auditors, and even community contributors, creating an untenable legal environment for the entire DeFi sector. The Future of DeFi Tools : Navigating Legal Uncertainty This lawsuit represents a pivotal moment for the future of DeFi Tools and the broader crypto ecosystem. The outcome could either provide much-needed clarity and foster innovation or cast a long shadow of legal uncertainty that stifles growth and pushes development offshore. The challenges are clear: Regulatory Chill: Developers and entrepreneurs might shy away from building in the U.S. if the legal risks are too high, potentially leading to a brain drain in the crypto space. Innovation Stifled: Fear of prosecution could prevent the creation of new, innovative DeFi protocols that could offer financial inclusion and efficiency. Reduced Competitiveness: Other jurisdictions with clearer or more favorable regulatory frameworks might attract the talent and capital that would otherwise flow to the U.S. Conversely, a favorable ruling for Lewellen, supported by the strong arguments from the crypto advocacy groups, could set a positive precedent. It would provide a clearer distinction between software development and financial intermediation, giving developers the confidence to innovate without constant fear of legal reprisal. This would be a significant win for the entire decentralized movement, affirming that code is speech and that building tools should not automatically equate to operating a regulated financial business. What Can the Community Do? Actionable Insights While this lawsuit unfolds in the courts, the broader crypto community has a role to play in advocating for clear, sensible regulation. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow developments in this case and other regulatory actions closely. Understanding the nuances is key to effective advocacy. Support Advocacy Groups: Organizations like those that filed the amicus brief are on the front lines. Supporting their work, whether through donations, volunteering, or simply amplifying their message, is crucial. Engage with Policymakers: Where possible, engage with elected officials and regulators to share your perspective on the importance of responsible innovation and the need for clear legal frameworks. Educate Others: Help demystify DeFi and open-source technology for those unfamiliar with it, emphasizing its potential benefits and the distinction between software tools and financial services. This lawsuit is more than just a legal dispute; it’s a battle for the soul of decentralized technology. The collective action of crypto advocacy groups highlights the industry’s determination to protect innovation and ensure that the U.S. remains a fertile ground for technological advancement. The outcome will undoubtedly shape how developers approach open-source projects and how regulatory bodies interact with the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized finance. It’s a testament to the power of a united front against what many see as an existential threat to the core principles of crypto.

CRO on the Run Following news that Truth Social, the social media giant operated by the Trump family, had filed with the US SEC to launch a Crypto Blue-Chip ETF, which would include BTC, ETH, SOL, CRO, and XRP, the price of the Cronos ecosystem exploded by double-digits. The asset went from roughly $0.082 to $0.095, corrected slightly, but shot up once again in the past day to over $0.1 for the first time in about a month. Although it has lost some traction since then and is currently down to $0.095, it’s still up by over 15% on the day. The other assets mentioned in the filing are also in the green, albeit in a less impressive manner. SOL, XRP, and ETH are up by 1-2% daily. More notable price pumps come from NEAR, AAVE, XLM, HBAR, and LINK, all of which have added around 5-6% of value.

The tweet directly mentioned Project Stella, a collaborative study between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan, which evaluated the use of blockchain and related technologies to improve international payment systems. According to X Finance Bull, Project Stella examined Ripple’s network “rails” next to SWIFT as part of its exploration of modernizing cross-border settlement processes. The tweet suggested that the study considers how distributed ledger-based platforms, such as RippleNet, could rewire the infrastructure of global money transfers by enabling faster, more efficient, and transparent transactions across borders. The comment was accompanied by an image excerpt from a document highlighting Ripple’s xCurrent product and SWIFT’s global payments innovation (gpi). The document excerpt noted that Ripple has developed xCurrent, a solution designed to connect financial institutions through a global network of participating entities known as RippleNet. It further explained that xCurrent is built on the Interledger Protocol (ILP), which allows bidirectional communication and coordination of payments across different ledgers. In parallel, it described SWIFT’s gpi as a new standard intended to enhance speed, security, and transparency in correspondent banking. Still doubting $XRP ?

The attached image from the highlighted document section reiterated that Ripple’s xCurrent enables interoperability across ledgers and facilitates global connections among banks. Similarly, it described how SWIFT gpi improves transparency and operational efficiency in traditional correspondent banking. Outlook on XRP The tweet concluded by asserting that “XRP will explode soon,” suggesting an expectation of a significant upward movement in the value of XRP . While the tweet did not provide specific price targets or timeframes, it tied this prediction to the ongoing institutional research into Ripple’s infrastructure. X Finance Bull’s position is that central banks’ active evaluation of Ripple’s technology is a clear indication of its relevance in the evolving global financial system. The tweet, therefore, highlighted both the recognition Ripple has received from major monetary authorities and the potential for XRP to benefit from greater adoption of the underlying network technology .

Large holders are quietly exiting their positions and the sell signals are becoming harder to ignore. On-chain data shows trillions of SHIB tokens have been moved to exchanges, pointing to a growing loss of confidence among whales. Smart money is shifting to projects that promise real-world value, like Remittix (RTX) . Shiba Inu (SHIB) Faces Sell-off Shiba Inu is trading around $0.00001187, sliding in response to recent whale activity. Market data shows that Santiment reports over half of SHIB’s supply is controlled by just ten wallets. When big holders move their tokens, the impact can be swift and severe. Source: CoinMarketCap A massive single-day drop of over 12% took SHIB to $0.00001177 after trillions of tokens shifted to exchanges. CoinDesk flagged a whale transaction of 2.87 trillion SHIB worth $36 million, but later noted this was a custody transfer, not a sale. Even so, Binance data and other exchanges report similar shifts for institutional wallets, signaling a broader withdrawal of confidence. Despite the sell-off, the number of SHIB wallets has exceeded 1.5 million. The Shibarium Layer 2 migration also continues, with over 1.5 million users already on board. That’s solid ecosystem growth. Shibarium has logged more than 1.2 billion transactions and counts over 266 million connected wallets, a signal that the community is still engaged. But on-chain activity doesn’t always prevent price drops. SHIB now hovers near a critical support level of $0.0000102. Breaks below that could trigger deeper losses, possibly reaching lows near $0.0000060. Why Traders Are Watching Remittix One of the projects catching attention right now is Remittix (RTX) . Unlike meme tokens, RTX solves an actual problem. It lets users convert crypto like SHIB, ETH or BTC into FIAT currencies and send it straight to a bank account, all in one step. Remittix is already catching the attention of freelancers, remote workers and everyday crypto users who just want a simple way to use their earnings. Users don’t need to shuffle through multiple apps or jump between exchanges. Remittix supports over 100 cryptocurrencies and works with 30+ FIAT currencies, so people can cash out or hold onto their money with ease. That kind of convenience is exactly why more users are starting to take notice. As more traders shift focus from hype to utility, tokens like RTX are stepping into the spotlight. They’re not promising the moon. They’re delivering a service people already need. Expert Verdict Gives Remittix the Edge Whale exits, centralized token control and unstable burn rates make Shiba Inu risky in the short term. Ecosystem momentum like Shibarium helps, but might not be enough to offset declining core support. Meanwhile, Remittix is delivering tangible value: crypto-to-cash access that works today. For those steering away from meme coins and looking for utility, Remittix could be the next smart move.

Here's Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/new-zealand-government-decides-to-ban-crypto-atms-heres-why/,"The New Zealand government has decided to ban crypto ATMs in the country and impose a NZD 5,000 limit on international cash transfers. New Zealand Bans Crypto ATMs and Limits Cash Transfers This comprehensive regulation aims to reshape the AML/CFT regime (Anti-Money Laundering/Counter Financing of Terrorism) within the framework of the fight against money laundering and organized crime. The 221 crypto ATMs operating in the country have been scrutinized for allegedly being used in illegal transactions such as transferring criminal proceeds abroad and drug trafficking. New Zealand Deputy Justice Minister Nicole McKee announced the new bill today, stating that the reform would expand the powers of both police and financial regulators, allow intelligence agencies to collect financial data more comprehensively, and that a new funding cut to finance the system would be discussed. “This government wants to go after criminals with determination. Our aim is to make New Zealand the easiest place in the world to do legitimate business and the hardest place in the world for criminals,” McKee said. The new regulation has been welcomed by some in the industry as a positive step. Janine Grainger, co-founder of crypto trading platform Easy Crypto, said the ban is a sign of maturation in the industry, adding: “We've been watching the rapid proliferation of crypto ATMs, but we want this growth to proceed safely and compliantly. That's why we support the ban.” Grainger emphasized that crypto ATMs often operate with high transaction fees of up to 20%, which has now lost its appeal for many users. Arjun Vijay, founder of Giottus crypto exchange, stated that without security measures such as identity verification (KYC), misuse of these devices is inevitable: Bitcoin ATMs, with their high fees and anonymous transaction features, are often used for illicit fund movements. This ban is not surprising. New Zealand's decision comes amid growing global concerns about crypto ATMs being used for criminal activities. In Australia, AUSTRAC has placed the industry under surveillance, citing a rise in crypto scams targeting the elderly. The US city of Spokane has completely banned crypto kiosks after FBI data linked the devices to $5.6 billion in fraud in 2024. It is stated that the ban in New Zealand is not a “setback” in the crypto sector, but rather a sign of a transition to a more robust and secure structure. *This is not investment advice.

The latest clarification from South Korea’s National Tax Service (NTS) is set to redefine how you handle your finances. In a significant move, the NTS has explicitly stated that virtual assets received as employment income from foreign corporations must be declared in a comprehensive income tax return. This ruling brings much-needed, albeit perhaps challenging, clarity to the evolving landscape of South Korea crypto tax. What’s the Latest on South Korea Crypto Tax? The National Tax Service (NTS) recently addressed a critical inquiry that many residents might have been pondering: how to treat virtual assets received as wages from foreign entities. According to Digital Asset, the NTS confirmed that if you’re a resident receiving cryptocurrency from an overseas company under an incentive contract, and no withholding tax was applied by a tax association, you are indeed required to file a comprehensive income tax return. This decision, issued on July 9, provides a clear directive for individuals in this specific situation. The NTS based its position on key provisions of the Income Tax Act, specifically Articles 127 (Liability for Withholding) and 70 (Final Return on Tax Base of Global Income). These articles lay the groundwork for how income, regardless of its form or origin, is to be reported and taxed within South Korea’s jurisdiction. This clarification underscores the NTS’s commitment to ensuring that all forms of income, including those derived from the burgeoning world of virtual assets, are subject to proper taxation. Why is This NTS Tax Ruling So Important? This ruling from the NTS tax authority marks a significant step in how South Korea approaches the taxation of digital currencies. Historically, the taxation of cryptocurrencies has been a complex and often ambiguous area for governments worldwide. This specific clarification on crypto received as employment income from overseas companies fills a crucial gap, impacting a growing number of remote workers, freelancers, and consultants who might be compensated in digital tokens. Here’s why this matters: Clarity for Taxpayers: It removes ambiguity for South Korean residents about their obligations when earning crypto wages from abroad. Broadening Tax Base: It ensures that a new category of income, previously potentially overlooked or miscategorized, is brought into the tax net. Precedent Setting: This decision could set a precedent for future tax policies regarding various forms of crypto remuneration and international earnings. Increased Compliance: It puts the onus squarely on the individual taxpayer to report and comply, even if the foreign entity did not withhold taxes. Navigating Foreign Earned Income in Crypto: Challenges and Solutions While the NTS’s stance provides clarity, it also presents a new set of challenges for individuals dealing with foreign earned income in the form of cryptocurrencies. One of the primary hurdles is accurate valuation. Cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile, and determining the exact value at the time of receipt for tax purposes can be complex. Furthermore, tracking multiple receipts throughout the year and converting them to Korean Won (KRW) at the correct exchange rate on the date of receipt requires diligent record-keeping. Key Challenges: Valuation Volatility: How do you accurately value crypto received on different dates with fluctuating prices? Record Keeping: Maintaining meticulous records of every crypto payment received, including date, amount, and corresponding KRW value. Exchange Rate Fluctuations: Applying the correct exchange rate on the specific day of receipt can be a logistical nightmare without proper tools. Lack of Withholding: Unlike traditional employment where taxes are often withheld at the source, individuals receiving crypto from overseas must manage their tax liabilities proactively. Actionable Solutions: To navigate these complexities, South Korean residents earning crypto from abroad should consider the following: Diligent Record Keeping: Maintain detailed records of all crypto payments received, including the date, type of cryptocurrency, amount, and the fair market value in KRW at the time of receipt. Screenshots, transaction IDs, and exchange rate data are invaluable. Professional Tax Advice: Consult with a tax professional specializing in cryptocurrency and international taxation. They can provide tailored advice and ensure compliance with the latest NTS guidelines. Utilize Crypto Tax Software: Consider using dedicated cryptocurrency tax software that can help track transactions, calculate gains/losses, and generate tax reports compliant with local regulations. Understand the Income Tax Act: Familiarize yourself with Articles 127 and 70 of the Income Tax Act to grasp the legal basis of your reporting obligations. Proactive Filing: Do not wait for the NTS to inquire. Proactively file your comprehensive income tax return, even if no withholding was made. How Does South Korea’s Stance Compare Globally? South Korea’s proactive approach to taxing crypto income, particularly from foreign sources, places it among a growing number of nations attempting to formalize their digital asset tax frameworks. Many countries are grappling with similar challenges: United States: The IRS views crypto as property, and income earned in crypto (e.g., wages, mining rewards) is generally taxable as ordinary income at its fair market value in USD on the date received. Japan: Japan generally classifies crypto as miscellaneous income, with profits from trading or earning crypto subject to progressive tax rates. Germany: Germany offers a more favorable stance for long-term holders, often exempting crypto held for over a year from capital gains tax, but income from services paid in crypto is taxable. India: India has a flat 30% tax on income from the transfer of virtual digital assets, with no deductions except for the cost of acquisition. This global trend indicates a maturing regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. As digital assets become more integrated into the global economy, tax authorities worldwide are working to establish clear guidelines to ensure fair and equitable taxation. South Korea’s NTS ruling is a clear signal that the era of ambiguous crypto taxation is rapidly drawing to a close, at least for certain types of income. The Future of Virtual Assets and Taxation in South Korea The NTS’s clarification is a significant milestone in South Korea’s journey to regulate and tax virtual assets. It reflects a broader governmental effort to bring the digital economy into traditional financial frameworks. This move will likely pave the way for further detailed regulations concerning other aspects of cryptocurrency, such as staking rewards, DeFi earnings, or NFT-related income. For individuals and businesses operating in or with South Korea, staying informed and compliant is paramount. The NTS is clearly taking a firm stance on ensuring all forms of income are reported, regardless of their digital nature or international origin. This commitment to tax enforcement highlights the importance of proactive planning and professional consultation for anyone involved in the crypto space in South Korea. In conclusion, the NTS’s recent clarification on reporting crypto wages from overseas companies is a critical development for South Korean residents. It underscores the growing importance of compliance in the digital asset space and serves as a strong reminder that South Korea crypto tax laws are evolving rapidly.

South Korea’s government is taking steps to support the crypto industry by officially recognizing crypto businesses as part of its venture ecosystem. A new proposal from the Ministry of SMEs and Startups aims to let crypto firms register as “venture companies” – a status that gives access to tax cuts, government-backed funding, subsidies, and loan guarantees. If approved, the move could bring crypto startups in line with other tech-driven businesses and help boost innovation across the sector. Here is everything you absolutely need to know. A Big Policy U-Turn for South Korea Right now, crypto businesses in South Korea are excluded from registering as venture companies. That’s because current laws group them with restricted sectors like gambling and nightlife which are categories that don’t qualify for state support. That restriction has cost crypto firms. In 2018, Upbit’s parent company Dunamu lost its venture status and was hit with an ₩24 billion (around $18 million) tax bill. The company challenged the decision in court, but lost. The ministry now wants to update the rules. The new proposal would remove virtual asset firms from the restricted list, allowing them to access the same support as other startups. “Virtual asset businesses with innovative and entrepreneurial qualities, based on new technologies, will be newly recognized as venture businesses,” the ministry said. Why This Matters for the Industry If the change is approved, it would mean crypto startups could apply for venture status for the first time, unlocking major benefits. It would also allow existing venture-certified companies to enter the crypto space without losing their status. According to the ministry, the change would “revitalize and broaden the venture ecosystem” and promote growth in the crypto industry. The government is now collecting public feedback on the proposal, with submissions open until August 18, 2025. A Clear Direction Under President Lee The proposal is part of a wider shift under President Lee Jae Myung, who took office last month with a strong pro-crypto stance. His administration is pushing for spot Bitcoin ETFs, planning to introduce a Korean won-based stablecoin, and reviewing the current ban on institutional crypto trading. Some of the country’s biggest banks are already taking steps, from exploring stablecoin products to filing new trademark applications, showing that interest is building. Here’s the bottom line: If passed, this policy could open new doors for crypto businesses in South Korea giving them access to real financial support, and helping the country position itself as a serious player in global crypto innovation.",News,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ASIA|BTC|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-09 10:09:17

With the AI market projected to hit a staggering $16 trillion by 2030 , crypto analysts are now evaluating which tokens could benefit the most. Pi Coin is fast emerging as one of the most talked-about contenders, despite recent price stagnation. The $16 Trillion AI Revolution: And Pi Network Is Leading the Charge By 2030, Artificial Intelligence is expected to add a staggering $16 trillion to the global economy. That’s not hype — it’s the hard truth according to top research from PwC, McKinsey, and IDC. We’re not… pic.twitter.com/pravdpaPME — Mr Spock 𝛑 (@MrSpockApe) July 9, 2025 The Pi Network is doubling down on artificial intelligence (AI), and crypto analyst Mr. Spock believes this could shoot Pi Coin into the top ranks by 2030. If Pi captures just 1–5% of the projected $16 trillion global AI market, its market cap could explode from $3.53 billion to over $160 billion, translating to 46x to 200x returns for early investors. Riding the AI Wave During last month’s Pi2Day celebration, the Pi Core Team introduced the Pi App Studio and reaffirmed its commitment to AI integration. With a decentralized, AI-ready infrastructure in place, Pi Network aims to become the first blockchain fully optimized for artificial intelligence. Mr. Spock points to the network’s GenAI platform and developer tools as key enablers for building personalized, AI-driven applications. Pi Network’s long-term vision is to fuel a data-powered digital economy where developers and users benefit directly from AI utilities built on-chain. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Why Pi Network is Falling? 11 Key Actions That Could Prevent Pi Coin Price Crash , Pi Coin Price Forecast for 2030 According to Spock, if Pi Coin secures even a 1% stake in the AI market, its valuation could soar to $160 billion, pushing the token price above $21. At a 5% market share, the Pi price could hit $100 or more, marking a 200x rise. Despite currently trading under $0.50 and sitting at 30th in crypto rankings, the long-term potential appears explosive if Pi delivers on its roadmap. Expect a Short-Term Haul In the near term, however, Pi Coin faces downward pressure. Over 272 million tokens are set to unlock in July, potentially driving the price back to April lows of around $0.40. While this may concern short-term holders, long-term investors see the dip as a buying opportunity. For Pi Network to sustain its momentum, analysts urge the core team to mobilize its $100 million Pi Ventures fund and incentivize developers with meaningful rewards, something still lacking in the ecosystem’s current state. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

On July 8, US Spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a significant surge, recording a total net inflow of $80.08 million. This marks a pivotal moment, extending the streak of positive flows for the fourth consecutive trading day. For anyone following the evolution of digital assets, this consistent influx of capital into Bitcoin Inflows through regulated investment vehicles signals a growing confidence and appetite from the traditional financial sector. What’s Driving the Latest Bitcoin Inflows? This impressive performance isn’t just a fleeting moment; it’s a testament to the increasing comfort and strategic positioning of institutional investors within the crypto space. The continuous positive inflows highlight a shifting narrative around Bitcoin, moving it further into the mainstream financial landscape. But what exactly does this mean for the broader market, and why are we seeing such sustained interest? The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year opened the floodgates for a new wave of investors who previously might have been hesitant to directly hold cryptocurrencies. These ETFs offer a regulated, accessible, and often more palatable way for institutions and retail investors alike to gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of direct ownership, such as managing private keys or navigating crypto exchanges. Key Players Leading the Charge in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs While the overall net inflow figure is compelling, a closer look reveals which players are truly dominating this new wave of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption . BlackRock’s IBIT continues to be a powerhouse, consistently attracting the lion’s share of new capital. This isn’t surprising, given BlackRock’s immense reach and reputation in traditional finance. Here’s a snapshot of the individual ETF performances on July 8: ETF Ticker Issuer Net Inflows (July 8) IBIT BlackRock $66.82 million BTC Grayscale (mini) $4.82 million FBTC Fidelity $4.75 million BRRR Valkyrie $3.69 million Others Various No Change As evident from the table, BlackRock’s IBIT is not just leading; it’s significantly outperforming its peers in terms of attracting new capital. This dominance suggests that large institutional investors are comfortable placing their trust and funds with established financial giants, even when venturing into the relatively newer asset class of Bitcoin. How Do These Inflows Impact Crypto Market Trends? The consistent positive flows into spot Bitcoin ETFs have several profound implications for the broader Crypto Market Trends and the future trajectory of Bitcoin: Increased Liquidity and Stability: As more capital flows into these ETFs, it enhances the overall liquidity of the Bitcoin market. Greater liquidity can lead to reduced price volatility, making Bitcoin a more attractive asset for a wider range of investors. Validation of Bitcoin: The sustained institutional interest acts as a powerful validation for Bitcoin as a legitimate and viable asset class. This can encourage more traditional financial entities to explore digital assets, further bridging the gap between old and new finance. Potential for Price Appreciation: While not a direct cause-and-effect relationship, consistent buying pressure from ETFs can contribute to Bitcoin’s price appreciation. As demand outstrips supply, especially with Bitcoin’s capped supply, the price tends to rise. Broader Accessibility: The success of these ETFs demonstrates the immense demand for accessible Bitcoin investment products. This could pave the way for more innovative crypto-related financial products in the future, catering to diverse investor needs. It’s important to remember that while inflows are a positive sign, the crypto market remains dynamic and subject to various global macroeconomic factors, regulatory developments, and technological advancements. However, the current trend paints a hopeful picture for Bitcoin’s journey towards wider adoption. What’s Next for Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The momentum seen in US Spot Bitcoin ETFs is likely to continue, especially as more financial advisors and wealth managers become educated about these products and integrate them into client portfolios. We could see: Increased Competition: As the market matures, expect more innovation and competition among ETF providers, potentially leading to lower fees and more diversified offerings. Global Expansion: The success of US ETFs could inspire similar product launches in other major financial jurisdictions, further globalizing institutional access to Bitcoin. Educational Initiatives: Financial institutions will likely ramp up efforts to educate their clients on the benefits and risks of Bitcoin ETFs, fostering greater understanding and potentially driving more inflows. While the journey of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market is always filled with its share of ups and downs, the consistent positive inflows into these ETFs underscore a significant and undeniable trend: institutional money is here, and it’s increasingly making its presence felt. This marks a new chapter in Bitcoin’s story, one where it’s not just a speculative asset but a recognized and increasingly integrated component of global investment portfolios. The recent surge in Bitcoin Inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs, spearheaded by giants like BlackRock’s IBIT, is a powerful indicator of growing institutional confidence and the increasing maturity of the crypto market. Four consecutive days of positive net inflows, totaling $80.08 million on July 8, highlight a robust demand for regulated Bitcoin exposure. This trend is not just about numbers; it signifies a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class, promising enhanced liquidity, stability, and potentially further price appreciation. As Institutional Bitcoin Adoption continues to accelerate, driven by the accessibility and convenience of ETFs, the future of Crypto Market Trends looks increasingly intertwined with traditional finance, opening new avenues for growth and investment.

The gold stockpile is kept in a vault in Switzerland in an undisclosed location for security reasons. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, Chief Executive Paolo Ardoino said that the pile of gold is worth $8 billion. He claimed that the gold is kept in a facility that is the most “most secure vault in the world.” Although, the company would not reveal its location for security reasons. Ardoino also declined to disclose when the vault was establish. The only detail he unveiled was that the vault is based somewhere in Switzerland . At the moment, the USDT ( USDT ) stablecoin issuer Tether holds nearly 80 tons of gold, with most of it being owned directly by the company. The amount is almost equal to the total value of metals and other commodities held by UBS Group. This large stockpile makes Tether one of the largest gold holders in the world outside of banks and nation states. You might also like: Gold hits new ATH at $3,390, is Bitcoin close behind? Ardoino acknowledged the rise in safe haven assets especially gold compared to fiat currency in his interview with Bloomberg. He said the decision to have their own vault instead of paying vault operators was driven by the rising cost of the asset. “Gold, I think should be logically a safer asset than any national currency. So eventually, I think that if people start to get concerned about the potential increase of the debt of United States, they might look at alternatives,” said Ardoino. According to the data from Trading Economics, gold has rallied as much as 38.5% in the past year. It also reached a new all-time high at $3,390 on April 21. At press time, it sits at a value of $3,289. Gold is often used as a hedge by investors against inflation, much like how Bitcoin ( BTC ) is viewed the same way. “Every single central bank in the BRICS countries is buying gold, so that is why gold price went up in our opinion,” he said. Earlier in April, the stablecoin giant issued 7.7 tons of physical gold to back its digital asset Tether Gold or XAUT ( XAUT ), which currently holds pure gold as a reserve backing on a 1:1 ratio. At press time, XAUT’s market cap stands at more than $811 million.

Why This Hearing Matters to XRP Garlinghouse will directly address lawmakers, urging them to differentiate digital assets like XRP from securities. This vital distinction on whether crypto tokens fall under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) jurisdiction has been a central issue. The hearing will spotlight bills like the CLARITY Act and GENIUS Act , which aim to resolve that ambiguity. Taking on X, formerly Twitter, Garlinghouse welcomed the Senate invite and stated , “I am honored to be invited to testify in front of the Senate Banking Committee this Wednesday on the need for passing crypto market structure legislation.” Ripple’s long-running legal disputes with the SEC, stemming from inconsistent messaging on whether XRP qualifies as a security, serve as a real-world case study. Therefore, Garlinghouse is expected to highlight these contradictions, arguing for a fair, stable regulatory environment. He pointed out, “Constructive crypto market structure legislation in the US is imperative in bringing about a new era of innovation and financial opportunity, while protecting consumers.” Notably, clear guidelines could legitimize XRP for institutional use, such as cross-border payments, decentralized finance (DeFi) integrations, and potentially a future XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) . The hearing signals to financial markets and regulators that crypto can be responsibly integrated within the broader financial system. The XRP Community Response Across social platforms, sentiment is electric. Advocates describe Garlinghouse’s testimony as “a defining moment” for XRP’s legitimacy. One top crypto lawyer and pundit, John Deaton, pointed out , “No better example than Ripple & XRP regarding both lack of clarity and confusion between agencies.” Discussions on Telegram and X emphasize that this is a chance to cement XRP’s future in mainstream finance. XRP’s Journey to $1,000 is no Longer a Wild Dream According to crypto analyst BarriC, “People buying $XRP at $0.006 in 2017 weren’t expecting XRP to skyrocket to $3.80 in 2018. This is exactly what will happen with $XRP and the people buying it right now at $2. XRP will skyrocket from $2 to $1,000 a lot sooner than people anticipate.” The analyst believes the market still undervalues XRP’s potential, pointing to its explosive 2017 surge from pennies to nearly $4 as proof. BarriC argues that similar conditions could propel XRP to four-digit prices far sooner than most expect. Meanwhile, XRP recently shattered a multi-month descending triangle pattern after reclaiming the psychological price of $2.20. XRP breaking above the descending triangle's resistance line signals weakening selling pressure and a shift in momentum as buyers begin to take control. At the time of this writing, XRP was trading at $2.29, representing a 4.4% increase in the past week. Conclusion With regulatory fog ready to lift and mainstream opportunity within reach, XRP supporters are hopeful that Garlinghouse’s testimony could be the catalyst transforming the 4th-largest cryptocurrency based on market capitalization from a contested token into a globally adopted financial tool. As a result, the XRP community sees Ripple CEO’s Senate appearance as a moment of reckoning as this can drive the altcoin to unprecedented heights.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|MARKET|TRADING|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-09 11:50:34

Analyst Brian Quinlivan highlighted that excessive retail enthusiasm often precedes local price tops, warning traders to exercise caution even as sentiment indicators flash green. “It’s pretty clear that the crowd is starting to salivate over a potential $110K+ Bitcoin market value,” Quinlivan stated . He explained that trader emotions can often lead to ill-timed decisions, with price action frequently moving against overly bullish retail sentiment. Bullish Sentiment Hits Three-Week High Santiment’s data shows that bullish comments on Bitcoin now outnumber bearish ones by a ratio of 1.51 to 1, the highest reading in the past three weeks. This spike in optimism mirrors previous instances that preceded price corrections, including the declines seen on June 11 and July 7 after similar sentiment surges. On Monday, Bitcoin briefly touched a local high of $109,595 before retracing to $107,681, coinciding with a wave of bullish commentary across social platforms. Quinlivan noted that this pattern aligns with retail investors “buying into the rising momentum” of Bitcoin’s price, which often results in short-term pullbacks. Despite the potential for a near-term correction, Bitcoin remains in an upward trend, currently trading near $108,000, up 2.84% over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. Bitcoin Whale Inactivity Signals Market Caution Quinlivan also pointed out that Bitcoin whale wallets holding between 10 and 10,000 BTC have shown limited movement in recent days, a signal that may warrant caution. “For now, these wallets have been somewhat suspiciously flat,” he said, revealing that whales offloaded 14,140 BTC over the past week, indicating a pause in accumulation. Historically, whale accumulation often happen just before price increases, while periods of distribution or inactivity have signaled upcoming price declines across the crypto market. However, Quinlivan emphasized that the broader outlook remains bullish, with whales and sharks steadily accumulating Bitcoin over the past six months despite short-term market fluctuations. While traders remain eager for Bitcoin to reclaim its all-time high of $111,970 reached on May 22, Santiment suggests that a “mild pullback” could be healthy before a sustained move toward new highs, allowing market momentum to stabilize before the next major leg upward.

According to Tomas Grief, Chief Product Officer at Brainns, the EV giant could have amassed 160,000 BTC, now worth over $17 billion — simply by accepting just 2% of its car sales in Bitcoin since 2021. That stash would now be nearly half of Tesla’s total profits since 2021. Tesla’s $17 Billion What-If Scenario On May 12, 2021, Elon Musk stunned the crypto world. In a now-famous tweet, the Tesla CEO announced the company would suspend accepting Bitcoin for vehicle purchases, citing environmental concerns: “ Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels… but this cannot come at great cost to the environment.” He added Tesla wouldn’t sell its BTC and would reconsider transactions when mining became more sustainable. Here’s What Could Have Happened If Tesla Kept Going In a post on X , Tomas Grief shared a mind-blowing projection: If just 2% of Tesla’s sales since 2021 had been in Bitcoin — and the company held onto the BTC — Tesla would now own around 160,000 BTC. On May 12, 2021 (the day Tesla paused BTC payments), Bitcoin was $56,667 In just 11 days, BTC dropped nearly 39% after the announcement Today, Bitcoin trades around $108,826, up 88.9% year-over-year That 160,000 BTC stash would now be worth over $17 billion To put it in perspective: Tesla has made about $40 billion in profits since 2021. That means their potential BTC stash would have equaled 42.5% of total profit. Why Tesla Paused Bitcoin Payments Musk’s decision came amid rising scrutiny of Bitcoin’s environmental impact: High energy consumption, mostly from fossil fuels Significant carbon emissions and electronic waste Concerns about water and land usage While Bitcoin mining is slowly shifting towards renewables, these sustainability issues remain unresolved, making the tech community divided on its long-term viability. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Is the Bitcoin Bull Run Over or Just Getting Started? , Could Tesla Reconsider Accepting Bitcoin?

With price swings and multiple failed attempts to push past $112,000, many are wondering, is the bull run over? Are we entering another bear market? But, according to experienced crypto trader Mags, analysis suggests that Bitcoin may be preparing for another major rally. Bitcoin’s 50-WMA Hints at $130K Level In a recent tweet, Mags pointed out that Bitcoin’s 50-week moving average (50 WMA) has long acted as a strong support level. Whenever Bitcoin touched this line before, it often bounced back and moved higher. Mags’ chart highlights several historical “BUY” signals when Bitcoin touched the 50 WMA and later surged higher. The only “SELL” signal occurred back in early 2022, when BTC failed to hold above the moving average. Since then, the 50 WMA has continued to act as a strong support line. #Bitcoin – Bear market incoming? A lot of people think Bitcoin is heading into a bear market. The easiest way to check?

On-chain Activity Points to Accumulation Adding to this perspective is some recent large-scale on-chain activity. According to crypto analyst Maartunn, over 19,400 BTC, worth around $2.11 billion, were recently moved out of dormant wallets into institutional-grade addresses. These coins had not been touched for three to seven years. Institutional Accumulation Incoming? Three large transactions hit the chain this morning, moving dormant coins into likely institutional wallets: • Tx 1 3y–5y: 8,002 BTC • Tx 2 3y–5y: 2,438 BTC 5y–7y: 6,000 BTC • Tx 3 5y–7y: 3,002 BTC In… pic.twitter.com/pGF4YFkxFb — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) July 8, 2025 While such moves often hint at strategic selling, it suggests large investors might step in to buy while the price stays steady Short-Term Pressure Still Exists While everything isn’t just bullish yet.

Ripple has announced that BNY Mellon , the oldest bank in the U.S., will act as the primary custodian for its U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, Ripple USD (RLUSD). This means BNY Mellon will now hold the reserves that back RLUSD, marking a big moment not just for Ripple, but for the growing stablecoin industry. Great news! Here are the details. A Major Win for Ripple’s Regulatory Push This move gives Ripple a stronger position in the eyes of regulators and institutions, especially since BNY Mellon is known for working with large corporations and governments. According to the companies, the partnership is aimed at improving regulatory compliance and boosting institutional confidence in RLUSD. “As primary custodian, we are thrilled to support the growth and adoption of RLUSD by facilitating the seamless movement of reserve assets and cash to support conversions,” said Emily Portney, Global Head of Asset Servicing at BNY Mellon. RLUSD Crosses $500 Million in Just 7 Months Ripple launched RLUSD in December 2024 and it’s already crossed a $500 million market cap. That’s fast growth, even in a space that moves quickly. The stablecoin is fully backed 1:1 by cash and U.S. Treasuries, giving it the kind of security institutions expect. Ripple built RLUSD to work alongside its payment network and XRP token and it’s now gaining traction in real-world use. Ripple Eyes U.S. Banking Access Yes, Ripple is also aiming to go deeper into traditional finance. The company has applied for a national U.S. banking charter and a Federal Reserve master account, which would allow it to hold reserves directly with the central bank and use its payment rails. True to our long-standing compliance roots, @Ripple is applying for a national bank charter from the OCC. If approved, we would have both state (via NYDFS) and federal oversight, a new (and unique!) benchmark for trust in the stablecoin market. Earlier in the week via… https://t.co/IdiR7x3eWZ — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) July 2, 2025 That’s a big step for any crypto firm and shows Ripple’s focus on long-term integration with the financial system. Stablecoin Momentum Grows In USA Ripple’s latest move is part of a wider trend now being called “Stablecoin Summer.” As the Trump administration eases crypto restrictions and Congress moves closer to passing stablecoin laws, institutional interest is rising. Tech giants like Amazon, Walmart, Uber, Apple, and Airbnb are reportedly exploring stablecoin use cases. Ripple’s deal with BNY Mellon comes at a great time. AMINA Bank Expands RLUSD’s Global Reach Adding to this, AMINA Bank, a licensed Swiss institution, is now offering custody and trading services for RLUSD. AMINA is regulated by FINMA and already serves institutional investors and corporations, giving RLUSD even more credibility on a global scale. Clients can manage their RLUSD through AMINA’s secure mobile and desktop platforms, built on infrastructure trusted by banks worldwide. What’s Next? With a major Wall Street partner onboard and momentum building, Ripple is positioning RLUSD as a serious contender in the stablecoin space. The next milestone?

MATIC) Breaks Out: Is It Time to Go Long?,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/pol-prev-matic-breaks-out-is-it-time-to-go-long/,"The post POL (prev. MATIC) Breaks Out: Is It Time to Go Long? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The recent surge in the price of POL , previously known as MATIC, has caught the attention of both retail investors and long-term traders. With the price breaking above a key resistance zone ahead of the highly anticipated Heimdall upgrade, the market sentiment is shifting. With this, the question arises whether the current breakout can be considered as a genuine opportunity to take up long or just a short-term upswing. Heimdall v2 Upgrade on July 10, 2025 One of the key bullish catalysts behind POL’s breakout is the upcoming Heimdall v2 upgrade, scheduled to go live on July 10, 2025. This is the most comprehensive technical upgrade to Polygon PoS since its mainnet launch, completely overhauling the chain’s consensus mechanism. What Does Heimdall v2 Do? Migrates the consensus layer from the outdated Tendermint + Cosmos-SDK v0.37 to CometBFT + Cosmos-SDK v0.50 Reduces transaction finality from ~90 seconds to just 4–6 seconds Increases block processing speed to ~2-second intervals Cleans up legacy code, enabling faster development and future integrations Improves bridging reliability, with near-instant checkpoint confirmations This upgrade is not just cosmetic—it’s core to Polygon 2.0’s vision of achieving thousands of transactions per second via AggLayer architecture. For dApps, users, and validators, Heimdall v2 lays the groundwork for a faster, more secure, and enterprise-grade Polygon network. Why POL’s Long-Term Value is Rising Beyond the technical chart setup and upcoming upgrade, POL is fundamentally transforming into a high-utility asset within the Polygon ecosystem. In parallel with the Heimdall v2 upgrade, the migration from MATIC to POL has crossed key milestones: 85%+ of MATIC holders have migrated to POL Validator activity is up as POL becomes central to governance and staking Developer interest is growing, driven by better tooling and documentation post-upgrade This signals rising confidence in the protocol’s long-term utility and positions POL as a foundational token for the Polygon ecosystem moving forward. POL Price Breakout Attempt in Motion POL has recently moved above the $0.19 resistance area with a notable uptick in trading volume. The token is now attempting to flip its 20-day and 50-day moving averages into support, a classic reversal indicator in crypto price action. Although the short-term oscillators show strength, longer-term moving averages are still flashing caution, suggesting that traders should wait for confirmation before opening aggressive long positions. The POL price has risen above the descending parallel channel while the CMF has risen above 0, hinting towards a rise in the money inflow. However, the DMI has reached an interesting juncture where the +di & -di have undergone a bullish crossover, and the ADX has been forming consecutive higher highs and lows. Therefore, if the POL price closes the day’s trade above the channel, the bulls may push the price towards the next target at $0.25. However, the possibility of such a rise seems to be unlikely considering the current price action. The token is facing heavy resistance zones between $0.20 and $0.20-$0.46 due to prior accumulation. Besides, if the Heimdall v2 experiences post-fork bugs and validator lag, sentiment may turn bearish. Besides, broader market weakness or Bitcoin volatility could invalidate POL’s breakout.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|MATIC|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-09 11:55:39

In 2025, ETH stands strong, with analyst forecasts suggesting a breakout toward $10,000. Cointelegraph’s recent coverage pointed to a potential surge beyond its current rally as the Ethereum reboot gains traction. Even more, SEC approval for Ethereum ETFs continues to build institutional confidence. Yet, amid this optimism, forward-thinking investors are quietly rebalancing. They’re funneling resources into projects that promise faster utility, stronger scalability, or alternative narratives poised for breakout. The headline question becomes: which tokens will carry momentum when Ethereum takes a pause? Below are five trending altcoins—one actively preselling—that offer compelling reasons to be part of your 2025 strategy. Little Pepe (LILPEPE) Little Pepe is the only coin here still in presale—and it's a standout for a reason. LILPEPE isn’t just another frog meme; it’s debuting as a purpose-built Layer‑2 chain tailored for meme-age, backed by real products. With the presale now in its fourth stage at $0.0013, the first three phases sold out so swiftly that today’s participants are still early believers. The presale has raised more than $3.3 million in total. What sets this apart is the combination of speed, zero fees, bot protection, and a token model engineered for real engagement. Airdropped tokens for holders, zero taxes, and a roadmap that moves from birth to growth—complete with CEX listings and meme launchpads—make for both substance and community-hype. If the presale trajectory holds, LILPEPE could become one of the most buzz-worthy and user-first meme ecosystems in 2025. Solana (SOL) Solana’s reputation for blistering speed and ultra-low transaction costs has sharpened its appeal. Worth noting: the first U.S.-listed Solana-focused ETF, SSK (Solana + Staking), has already launched on Cboe. With Solana likely to benefit from both ETF allocation and staking-driven returns, the network’s ecosystem continues to evolve rapidly. Developer activity is climbing, DeFi use is accelerating, and Solana is once again delivering functionality at scale. For investors seeking activity outside of Ethereum, SOL offers both momentum and established credentials. Ripple (XRP) Ripple has quietly advanced in its mission to transform international finance. Regulatory headwinds may have slowed its pace in years past, but optimism surrounding XRP’s place in CBDCs and cross-border remittances is brewing. With Bitcoin and Ethereum gaining inclusion in U.S. strategic reserves, speculators wonder whether XRP may be next. Its ledger’s speed and low cost already make it a go-to for payment rails, but renewed institutional adoption could redefine its trajectory. Ripple’s team has made it clear: this isn’t just a token, it’s infrastructure. Chainlink (LINK) The world’s largest aggregator of decentralized oracles, Chainlink, is quietly underpinning global smart contracts. As Ethereum’s go-to oracle in 2025, LINK remains indispensable. Recent advances in Chainlink 2.0, including staking and hybrid on‑ and off‑chain computation, have solidified its role. Whether DeFi, NFTs, or tokenized real-world assets are your focus, Chainlink continues to serve as the connective tissue, tracking external events, rates, sports scores, and beyond. Its value proposition goes well beyond Ethereum, positioning LINK as a DeFi staple with long-term relevance. Stellar (XLM) For its pedigree of utility, Stellar is relatively undervalued. It has built practical use cases by focusing on cross-border payments and stablecoins. Its network is lightweight, efficient, and already integrated with banks and fintech firms. XLM’s strong presence in emerging markets aligns with the big-picture rollout of stablecoins and CBDCs in digital finance. While Ethereum remains dominant in DeFi, Stellar excels at moving value globally with minimal friction. As stablecoin adoption grows, XLM could be the next token riding that wave—this time beyond the Ethereum paradigm. Strong Bull Case for Spreading Bets This story isn’t hypothetical. Experts like Alphractal’s Joao Wedson highlight that altcoins flourish when Ethereum establishes new highs. Fingers crossed, ETH keeps climbing. But a smart investor doesn’t wait to ride Ethereum alone—they distribute across scalable ecosystems, real-world rails, infrastructure tokens, and even meme bridges with purpose. The presence of a meme coin with a robust purpose, like Little Pepe , illustrates this mindset shift. Investors can allocate a small portion to high-risk, high-upside presale tokens while backing established networks that solve tangible problems. Final Take Savvy managers understand their portfolio’s returns won’t ride solely on Ethereum’s shoulders. As the market evolves, smart investors are casting their nets across carefully selected alternatives. In 2025, coins that solve specific problems such as faster bridges, payment rails, oracle arbitration, and Layer‑2 utility will shine brightest. While Ethereum primes itself for institutional growth, these five tokens might just race ahead when altseason accelerates. The era of “only ETH” is fading. Welcome to 2025, where smart money says yes to progress—and yes to the path Ethereum paved.

Just days before the Emirates deal, the Dubai Land Department announced a separate MoU with Crypto․com to develop a blockchain-based ecosystem for virtual real estate investment. The Dubai Land Department’s partnership with Crypto․com, signed on July 6, to facilitate the buying, selling, and tokenization of real estate using crypto. The initiative falls under Dubai’s Real Estate Strategy 2033, which targets Dh1 trillion in real estate transactions under blockchain and tokenized asset technologies. The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) recently approved the QCD Money Market Fund (QCDT), the first tokenized money market fund in the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). The project is being developed in collaboration with Qatar National Bank (QNB) and DMZ Finance. Elsewhere in Dubai’s real estate sector, PRYPCO Mint , a joint initiative between the Dubai Land Department and PRYPCO, completed two tokenized property listings under a regulatory framework designed by the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), the Central Bank of the UAE, and the Dubai Future Foundation. TON residency under regulatory turmoil Despite the institutional adoption of crypto in the UAE, regulators have also barred some private initiatives that overstate the legal recognition of digital assets. Over the weekend, The Open Network (TON), a blockchain network originally developed by Telegram, announced a program offering 10-year UAE golden visas in exchange for a three-year stake of $100,000 worth of Toncoin, along with a one-time processing fee of $35,000. The offer claimed that applicants could retain control of their staked assets via smart contracts on the TON blockchain and would receive an annual yield of 3% to 4%. TON also stated that the visa process would be completed in under seven weeks with the help of UAE-based partners. However, the Emirates News Agency later issued a statement refuting TON’s claims. According to a joint clarification from the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security, the Securities and Commodities Authority, and VARA, digital asset holdings do not qualify for UAE golden visa eligibility.

According to the firm's analysis, the Recurring Fractal Cycle metric has accurately predicted BTC's peaks and troughs to the day since 2015. According to the analysis, the current cycle peak has not yet occurred when looking at this metric. Alphractal maintains that this fractal has been surprisingly accurate historically, stating, “Will it repeat this time? No one knows for sure, but there's a strong possibility.” Analysts claim that the fractal's accuracy will be tested again in the next few months. Related News: There's Significant Whale Activity in This Altcoin: They Unstaked $40 Million Worth of Tokens Alphractal also highlighted the activity in the crypto mining sector, noting that the correlation between mining stocks and Bitcoin market capitalization is an overlooked but highly leading signal in the market. Mining companies are currently rising faster than BTC. One company that stands out in particular is Iris Energy (IREN). The company’s market value has risen from $1.2 billion to over $4 billion in a short time. However, the decrease in correlation between BTC and mining stocks is a strong indicator that sharp fluctuations may occur in the coming period, according to Alphractal. Because large miners have significant BTC reserves both on-chain and in traditional financial markets, and the movements of these companies can directly affect the Bitcoin price. *This is not investment advice.

Stablecoin adoption may trigger Ethereum’s next explosive growth phase soon. Layer 2 scaling and rising utility boost Ethereum’s position for a breakout. Ethereum, the world’s second-largest blockchain, may be on the brink of its biggest breakout yet. According to market watchers, the explosive growth of stablecoins on the Ethereum network could be the long-awaited trigger for a massive, NVIDIA-style price rally. Nvidia’s Breakout: A Blueprint for Ethereum? Nvidia’s story offers a useful comparison. According to Crypto Rover, an analyst analysis, before 2023, Nvidia’s stock price moved mostly sideways, showing little momentum. Then came the AI revolution, marked by ChatGPT’s massive public adoption. As the demand for GPUs exploded, Nvidia’s share price rocketed from below $20 to more than $160 (split-adjusted). This eightfold increase happened because a sudden, massive demand surge hit a technology that was already built and ready. Nvidia’s hardware was already powering AI workloads, so it became the go-to supplier overnight.

47882900,https://coinpaper.com/9861/robinhood-and-bio-sig-lead-tokenization-push-in-equities-and-gold,1752062400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Robinhood and BioSig Lead Tokenization Push in Equities and Gold,https://coinpaper.com/9861/robinhood-and-bio-sig-lead-tokenization-push-in-equities-and-gold,"Robinhood has seen an influx of inquiries from private firms eager to tokenize their shares after launching its equity token platform in the EU. At the same time, BioSig Technologies and Streamex have secured $1.1 billion in growth financing to kickstart a gold-backed onchain treasury business, aiming to challenge incumbents in the tokenized commodities space. Robinhood's Tokenized Stock Platform Sparks Wave of Interest From Private Firms Amid Global Tokenization Boom Robinhood has ignited a surge of demand from private companies looking to tokenize their shares following the launch of its stock token platform in the European Union last week. In an interview with Bloomberg News on Tuesday, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev revealed that private firms are lining up to bring their equity onchain as tokenized assets, eager to tap into a new wave of retail investment. “Since our announcement, I’ve had a deluge of inquiries,” Tenev said. “Private companies that actually want to access retail to have their shares tokenized and be a part of this revolution.” The platform, which debuted in the EU, currently allows users to trade over 200 tokenized US equities five days a week. In a marketing move aimed at showcasing future possibilities, Robinhood also included a promotional giveaway featuring non-tradable tokens representing high-profile private firms like OpenAI and SpaceX. A Push to Democratize Access to Private Equity Tenev emphasized that Robinhood's long-term mission is far broader than simply offering tokenized versions of existing public stocks. The company is aiming to bring thousands of private companies onto its platform, providing new pathways for retail investors to participate in traditionally exclusive investment opportunities. “We believe [this] is a huge opportunity to resolve one of the biggest inequities in capital markets,” said Tenev. “You have these massive companies that are staying private longer, and regular investors are missing out.” For years, retail investors have been locked out of the private equity space due to regulatory hurdles, high minimum investment thresholds, and limited access to early-stage deal flow. Tokenization — the process of converting real-world assets into blockchain-based tokens — offers a way to break these barriers, increasing liquidity, transparency, and inclusivity. Despite the excitement, Robinhood’s venture into tokenized assets has not gone unnoticed by regulators. The Bank of Lithuania, the supervisory body overseeing Robinhood’s EU operations, has requested clarity on how the tokens are structured. Tenev welcomed the inquiry, noting, “They want to make sure that everything is proper because it’s a new innovative offering. We’re confident. We think that these are not only important, but they’ll withstand the highest form of scrutiny.” Under the EU’s regulatory framework, tokenized stocks offered by Robinhood are treated as derivatives and must comply with both the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). These tokens are fully backed by underlying equities held by US brokers, with the corresponding tokens minted or burned as users buy or sell. US and UK Expansion on the Horizon While the platform is currently limited to European users, Tenev confirmed that Robinhood is in discussions with regulators in both the United States and the United Kingdom about expanding the service. “The US shouldn’t be far behind,” Tenev noted. “The opportunity is too large to ignore. Not just for retail but also institutional. And I think they’re keen. They’re having tokenization roundtables at the SEC, which we’ve been a part of.” Tenev suggested that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve tokenized equities without the need for new legislation — a move that could dramatically reshape the accessibility and structure of financial markets. The entrance of Robinhood into tokenized equity trading has not gone unnoticed by incumbents. Galaxy Digital, a major crypto investment firm, has stated that Robinhood’s approach effectively removes assets from traditional finance (TradFi) channels and migrates them onchain — a move that could challenge the dominance of centralized exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). If successful, Robinhood’s platform could undermine the liquidity and control advantages held by legacy institutions, redistributing financial power and access. BioSig and Streamex Secure $1.1 Billion to Launch Tokenized Gold Platform, Challenge Paxos and Tether in Onchain Commodities In related news, BioSig Technologies and Streamex have secured $1.1 billion in growth financing to establish a gold-backed onchain treasury platform, marking a significant expansion into the tokenized commodities space. The companies, which signed a letter of intent to merge on May 5, said the new funding will serve as a foundation for launching a suite of blockchain-based gold financial products and structured instruments. The financing comprises $100 million in senior secured convertible debentures and a $1 billion equity line of credit, providing the new entity with both operational flexibility and deep liquidity to seed its tokenization strategy. At the heart of the initiative is a plan to tokenize physical gold and gold-related assets, offering investors a digitally native alternative to traditional gold exposure. The new venture will compete directly with industry incumbents Paxos Gold (PAXG) and Tether Gold (XAUT), which currently dominate the market with combined capitalizations of $1.74 billion, according to CoinGecko. But BioSig and Streamex are not simply copying the competition. Henry McPhie, CEO of BioSig and co-founder of Streamex, said that their model will diverge from existing frameworks. Unlike Paxos and Tether — which back their tokens 1:1 with gold stored in vaults — McPhie hinted that the new model could involve structured or synthetic gold products, which could offer broader financial instruments beyond pure spot exposure. Four Revenue Streams and a 2026 Launch Target BioSig and Streamex aim to generate revenue through four distinct channels: Origination fees for structuring tokenized assets Tokenization fees tied to asset issuance Secondary market trading fees Spread income from market-making activities and liquidity provision The company plans to launch its first tokenized gold product by early 2026, with expectations to tap into demand from both retail and institutional investors seeking blockchain-based exposure to commodities. Despite the positive long-term outlook, the news was met with short-term volatility. BioSig's stock fell 27.4% on Tuesday, though it remains up over 541% in the last six months, a reflection of investor anticipation for the company’s strategic transformation. Commodities Tokenization Still in Early Stages While RWAs have become one of crypto’s breakout narratives in 2025, tokenized commodities remain a relatively small slice of the $24.5 billion tokenization market, according to RWA.xyz. Currently, the total market capitalization for tokenized commodities stands at $1.62 billion, with gold-backed tokens accounting for 98.9% of that figure. Tokenized commodities market over time (Source: RWA.xyz ) Among the eight tokenized precious metal products listed on RWA.xyz: Six are backed by gold One is tied to silver One is linked to platinum BioSig and Streamex will be entering a space heavily concentrated in gold, but still largely underserved compared to traditional commodity markets. Statista projects the global commodities market will reach $142.9 trillion in 2025, suggesting enormous room for tokenized penetration. As more financial firms explore RWA tokenization, the space is beginning to attract attention from regulators across multiple jurisdictions. While no specific regulatory hurdles have been cited by BioSig or Streamex, the structured nature of their planned products — and the use of convertible debt in their funding stack — suggests future offerings may undergo close scrutiny. That said, growing institutional interest, a wave of tokenization pilot programs from asset managers, and the increased popularity of onchain finance all point to a maturing ecosystem that could soon support more complex, compliant gold-backed instruments.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,FIAT|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|PAXG,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-09 12:00:00

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As crypto investors move beyond hype, platforms like SAVVY MINING are gaining attention for offering steady, market-free returns through automated cloud mining. Table of Contents What is SAVVY MINING? Why are investors choosing SAVVY MINING cloud mining? Core advantages of the platform How to start mining Investment trend change: From speculation to long-term returns With Solana ( SOL ) continuing to expand in the blockchain field, Ripple ( XRP ) being widely used in cross-border payments in Asia, and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) regaining the attention of retail investors, the enthusiasm for cryptocurrencies has been rekindled. But behind the hustle and bustle, more and more investors are beginning to change their minds, no longer paying attention to market hype, but turning their attention to areas that can truly bring stable returns. This is exactly why SAVVY MINING is gradually gaining attention. What is SAVVY MINING? SAVVY MINING is a cloud mining platform headquartered in the UK, which has completed registration and filing with the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). It provides investors with a passive income path without hardware and technical barriers through an advanced blockchain automation system. Simply put, users only need to choose the right mining contract, and the platform will automatically run the computing power and deposit the income into users’ accounts every day. Why are investors choosing SAVVY MINING cloud mining? Compared with the 20%-30% fluctuation of the coin price, SAVVY MINING provides another option: predictable and sustainable income. Even in the downturn of the market, the platform can still bring stable daily income to users with its optimized computing power configuration and top mining infrastructure. This is not empty talk, but real feedback from users after actual testing. Some users have obtained stable passive income of more than $5,000 per day through BTC contracts, which is much higher than the risk-return when the coin price rises. Core advantages of the platform Users can enjoy a $15 computing power reward upon registration with no additional requirements. The contract income is transparent, automatic settlement is made daily, and support is available for viewing at any time. There are no additional service fees and hidden management fees. The fund security is double-protected by McAfee and Cloudflare. There is 24×7 hours online customer service support. The official app supports Android and Apple phones. The alliance program rewards up to $100,000, and users can get high referral rewards by inviting friends. The platform supports settlement of more than 10 mainstream currencies: DOGE, BTC, ETH, LTC, USDC, USDT, BNB, BCH, XRP, SOL. How to start mining Step 1: Users can register an account for free, it only takes 1 minute. Users can register to receive a $15 reward and get $0.6 free income every day. Step 2: Then, users can choose a suitable mining contract and flexibly configure it according to their investment goals. Step 3: Next, users can enjoy the income. The platform automatically settles the income every day, and they can withdraw it to their crypto wallet at any time. Latest contract example: income is visible ⦁ [Free computing power contract] Principal: $15, term 1 day, principal + income: $15.6 ⦁ [Primary experience contract] Principal: $100, term 2 days, principal + income: $107.32. ⦁ [Classic computing power contract] Principal: $500, term 5 days, principal + income: $532.25. ⦁ [Classic computing power contract] Principal: $3,000, term 18 days, principal + income: $3,761.4. ⦁ [Advanced computing power contract] Principal: $13,800, term 40 days, principal + income: $23,184. ⦁ [Super computing power contract]: Principal: $100,000, term 45 days, principal + income: $194,500. When the account balance reaches $100, you can apply for withdrawal or continue to invest to obtain compound interest. Example calculation: How to make more than $90,000 in 45 days? If users invest $100,000 to buy [Super Computing Power Contract], the contract period is 45 days, and the daily interest rate is 2.1%: Daily income = $100,000 x 2.1% = $2,100 Total income = $2,100 x 45 = $94,500 Total amount due = $100,000 + $94,500 = $194,500 Investment trend change: From speculation to long-term returns As the market matures, the myth of getting rich by short-term transactions in the past is gradually being broken by reality. Instead, a more sustainable and controllable strategy is being used. Solana’s strong rise, XRP’s deep landing in the payment network, and DOGE’s community-driven effect all show that mainstream currencies still have huge potential. The advantage of SAVVY MINING is that it allows these currencies to not only be “held” but also “earn interest”. To learn more, visit the official website or download the official APP .

The prospectus sketches a five-coin portfolio weighted approximately 70 percent to bitcoin, 15 percent to ether, 8 percent to solana, 5 percent to Cronos and 2 percent to XRP, making it the first Trump-branded product to diversify beyond the two largest digital assets. The trust, structured as a Nevada business trust and sponsored by boutique issuer Yorkville America Digital, aims to list its shares on NYSE Arca. Foris DAX Trust — the US institutional arm of Crypto.com — is named digital-asset custodian, while authorized participants will create and redeem blocks of 10,000 shares in kind or for cash, subject to NYSE rule changes. The prospectus also discloses that staking rewards on ether, solana and cronos may be passed through to the fund, a design choice that would set a precedent among US spot-crypto ETFs. Related Reading: Pundit Explains Why XRP Stands To Gain Big From Ripple’s RLUSD Analyst Eric Balchunas of Bloomberg distilled the filing in two succinct posts on X: “New filing for the Truth Social Crypto Blue Chip ETF, which will be a spot crypto basket holding Bitcoin, Ether, Solana, XRP and Cronos,” he wrote; in a follow-up, he reproduced the pivotal language: “the Trust’s allocation… is initially expected to approximate 70% bitcoin, 15% ether, 8% SOL, 5% CRO and 2% XRP.” Those percentages now serve as the market’s working model for how the Trump universe ranks crypto’s ‘blue chips.’ Why Solana, Cronos And XRP? Overall, the allocation may serve as an implicit ranking of the top five crypto assets as viewed through the lens of Trump’s inner circle. Binance top trader by PnL Nachi (@alphawifhat) commented via X: “I think it’s useful to look at the allocation ratio of the Truth Social Crypto ETF I see this as an indication of how Trump’s crypto team looks at the top crypto assets and what are the top 5 they want to value the most. This could be a catalyst to pump CRO as it’s a dark horse.” Solana’s climb to an 8 percent weight is more than a momentum trade. CME Group this spring announced cash-settled Solana futures pending CFTC sign-off, extending the same institutional rails that helped bitcoin and ether graduate into ETF form. Notably, the SEC has set a July deadline for spot Solana ETF refilings, indicating a potential approval before the October 2 deadline.

Under the agreement, Crypto.com supplies custody, liquidity and back-end order routing for all Truth-branded funds. XRP brings up the rear at two percent, reflecting both its renewed legitimacy and its still-nascent institutional plumbing. On June 27, Ripple Labs announced that it will withdraw its cross appeal against the SEC. The token’s modest two-percent slice is politicized as much as it is financial. In early March a staffer from Ballard Partners—the K-Street shop that counts Ripple as a client—slipped Donald Trump draft language for a Truth Social post urging that XRP, Solana and Cardano be placed in a national “Crypto Strategic Reserve.” Trump hit “post” and only later discovered the Ripple connection; insiders told Politico he “was furious and felt like he’d been used.” Despite that, the inclusion of XRP still shows Trump’s ties with Ripple. At press time, XRP traded at $2.33.

It involves two words that should scare off the fainthearted… (1) bitcoin and (2) diversification. For many, the word “bitcoin” is an automatic red flag… gambling, etc. But actually, it and crypto are gaining respectability and even functionality (as real money). RIOT is a big-time miner. The number of possible new coins is capped. We won’t reach the end till about 2140, but growth will decelerate as we progress toward then. So, it makes sense for RIOT to diversify. Like other miners, it’s eyeing the data center business, a power-hungry cousin to mining. Success here won’t be automatic for anybody. But…. I think RIOT will succeed. It has a lot of good land near Dallas, an important Tier 1 data center region. This contributes to my story-oriented “Buy” rating. Remember when… Remember when Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ) sold books online? The company still does that, but it’s better known for other things today (selling countless different things, cloud). Remember when Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) was about operating systems? The company still does that, but it’s better known for other things today (cloud, application software). Remember when MicroStrategy sold enterprise analytics software? The company still does that, but with a new name, MicroStrategy Incorporated ( MSTR ), it’s now better known for other things (bitcoin Treasury holdings). Remember when Riot Blockchain was about Bitcoin mining? It still is and has lately been getting better at it, but the company rebranded in 2023 as Riot Platforms, Inc. (RIOT). That reflects its wish to diversify. RIOT can be uncomfortable for investors. It involves two words many find scary… I suggested one of them above… diversification. This sounds respectable, even essential, on its face. Investors constantly hear this when it comes to asset allocation. It can also serve companies well… so long as it’s done wisely. But many companies do it badly. As investment legend Peter Lynch says, one should guard against “ diworsification .” Rather than generating shareholder wealth, they instead make things worse… and generate accounting write-offs. Diversification might sound less challenging if we could at least understand and relax about RIOT’s core competency. But its established business confronts us with the other scary word. One, of course, is bitcoin. Many swear by it as the wave of the future in finance, as a store of value and as a better alternative to conventional money. Many others scorn it as nonsense or gambling. An investment case for or against RIOT stock should be based on how one evaluates it in terms of the two challenging words, diversification and bitcoin. Let’s start looking more closely at the latter… My Stance Toward Bitcoin Has Evolved and is Now Much More Positive Than It Was a Year or So Ago It took me a long time before I came around on bitcoin, and crypto in general. Like many, I thought it was nonsense at worst and at best, gambling without cool casinos, fun shows, and countless restaurants. Too, it can be easy (and self-gratifying) to see market participants as an ignorant or dysfunctional herd. Folks like Ben Graham and Warren Buffet helped to legitimize that view with the Mr. Market allegory . But as I accumulate years of experience analyzing investments (since late 1979), I’ve learned more and more about how important it is to respect the market. Information has become increasingly plentiful. And different views are more likely to reflect different investment goals and risk preferences. True stupidity is quite rare. That helped me see Bitcoin less as folly and more like a collectible… a digital collectible. How much different, once we adapt to the now-ubiquitous digital world, is a bitcoin than a gold bar or a baseball card picturing a great 1950s-era player. (See generally here ). Of course, some things are more collectible than other things. The bursting of the 1600s Dutch tulipmania proved that. As it turned out, the more I learned about the potentially functional properties of crypto and blockchain , the less necessary it became to delve deeper into the philosophy of collectibles. RIOT holds some bitcoin in Treasury (19,223 coins, amounting to about $5 per diluted RIOT share at bitcoin’s recent price of about $108,000). But unlike MSTR, it doesn’t necessarily hold permanently. RIOT has recently shown itself to be willing to use its bitcoin to help it raise capital for other things. (See below). And operationally… RIOT is One of the Major Domestic Bitcoin Miners Bitcoin mining is something of a brain scrambler. That’s so even for those who’ve learned to accept crypto as a legitimate asset. It’s a complex process. But it’s also quite interesting. (I explain more, in regular people language, in my 5/27/25 MARA report ). Here are the key aspects of mining you need to know to assess the investment merits of RIOT: Miners get newly issued coins by successfully answering an absurdly complex mathematical puzzle. Success requires a monstrous amount of computing trial and error. This is very electricity intensive. So, mining profitability isn’t only about bitcoin prices. It’s also about controlling power costs and mining equipment energy efficiency. Each trial is called a hash. Mining power is expressed as “hashrate” (number of trial answers per second). More trials and higher hashrates increase the likelihood of success. The number of possible bitcoins is capped at 21 million. To postpone the end date as far as possible, the number of coins awarded per successful hash is periodically cut in half. As miners go, RIOT is quite good. Scale alone helps RIOT manage power costs. But its primary Texas location may be a much bigger plus. The deregulated power market there opens up opportunities for creativity. A big thing for RIOT is its power curtailment strategy . Based on this, RIOT shuts mining operations during local periods of peak electricity demand. It especially times this in relation to the June through September Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) Four Coincident Peak (4CP) periods. But it doesn’t just stop trying to get Bitcoin. RIOT also sells power back to the grid during high-demand intervals. With electricity prices spiking at such times, RIOT does well, perhaps even better than it could by mining, on these occasions. According to CFO Colin Yee on the 5/1/25 earnings call : Direct cost of mine, excluding depreciation, in the first quarter of 2025 was $43,808 per Bitcoin, of which power costs amounted to $35,313 per Bitcoin or 81% of total direct cost per Bitcoin. Quarter-over-quarter, our net power costs decreased from $0.038 a kilowatt hour to $0.034 a kilowatt hour as Riot's power strategy continued to yield strong results. Another plus is RIOT’s dual cooling approach . It optimizes as appropriate between immersion and air-cooled systems. That’s another way to control power costs. Also, RIOT has a small Energy/Infrastructure operation. It contributes little in the way of revenues and profits. But it helps make RIOT vertically integrated . That means it gives the company more than usual control over its mining hardware supply chain. The unit makes equipment specifically geared for RIOT’s needs. Meanwhile, RIOT has dramatically increased its hashrate over the past year. RIOT IR The company has, lately, spent heavily to buy cutting-edge mining equipment. An acquisition of sorts (a deal involving Corsicana – see below) added to RIOT’s already-large scale. So bitcoin mining, the company’s dominant current business, is on a roll. Analyst Compilation and Calculations based on data from pages F47 - F48 of latest 10-K and pages 31-32 of latest 10-Q Analyst Compilation and Calculations based on data from pages F47 - F48 of latest 10-K and pages 31-32 of latest 10-Q Analyst Compilation and Calculations based on data from pages F47 - F48 of latest 10-K and pages 31-32 of latest 10-Q But let’s remember… As Great as Things Now Look for RIOT Mining, This Business Has a Ceiling RIOT’s forward hashrate expectations do not look especially buoyant. RIOT IR It could probably work harder to mine better… if it wished to. And as the slide notes, a recent acquisition (Rhodium) allows for some guidance upside (more below). Ultimately, though, the company strategically decided to refrain from adding much to mining capital spending. In fact, its latest 38.4 EH/s hashrate forecast is the result of management’s downward revision. It previously forecast 46.7 EH/s . (NOTE: EH/s means exahashes per second, or one quintillion hashes per second. A quintillion is one followed by 18 zeroes!) This relates to the last of the prior section’s bullet points. It bears repeating. The number of possible bitcoins is capped at 21 million. To postpone the end date as far as possible, the number of coins awarded per successful hash is periodically cut in half. Don’t panic… Mining isn’t likely to max out until about 2140 . But halving events (periodic reductions in the number of coins awarded for successful hashes) will continue to make this a progressively harder and probably less lucrative business. That seems opposed to what growth investors want. (Value investors don’t even get there… They’re likely stuck on the word “bitcoin.”) Rest assured RIOT management does NOT have its head in the sand about this. As noted above, it’s diversifying. To support this, RIOT is shifting resources and attention away from trying to max out on mining. That said… Diversification is not inevitable. The company could simply live with the halvings. Investors in natural resource royalty trusts and target date ETFs or mutual funds do something like that. (They face liquidation targets). So, too, could Bitcoin mining shareholders adjust (assuming they appropriately study up and really learn what’s going on). Combined with the RIOT’s owning bitcoin and serving as an asset play, this could work. So, RIOT can’t just diversify and insist all will be well. It also needs to diversify sensibly and well . Diversification must be better than alternative solutions. Diworsification won’t do! That’s why I referred above to diversification as one of the scary RIOT words. But there’s good news… RIOT’s Planned Move into Data Centers Stands an Excellent Chance of Success Demand for Data Centers in General Anybody with any interest in AI, HPC (High Performance Computing), etc. had to wonder about this earlier this year. Who among us could forget DeepSeek Apocalypse ( so named by me ). That happened when Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co., Ltd. ( DEEPSEEK ) announced it created a great AI model that cost much less than popular models then in use. AI-related stocks tanked. So, too, did those that relate to data centers. Investors assumed we were overspending. Many observers and investors feared cutbacks and lower data center demand. But eventually, analytic heads with boots-on-the-ground vantage points prevailed. And once-beaten-down stocks rebounded. On the 6/12/25 Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) earnings call , Larry Ellison, that company’s Co-Founder, Chairman and CTO, was quite definitive: Let me add, we recently got an order that said we'll take all the capacity you have wherever it is. It could be in Europe, it could be in Asia. We'll just take everything. I mean we never got an order like that before. We had to move things around. We did the best we could to give them the capacity they needed. The demand is astronomical… [D]emand right now seems almost insatiable. I mean I don't know how to describe it. I've never seen anything remotely like this. I mean people are calling up and asking us, please, can you find us more capacity. We'll take it wherever. It's in Malaysia, we'll take it fine. We'll take it there. We got some wherever. EMCOR Group, Inc. ( EME ) management shared similar views. See my 6/20/25 EME report for more. RIOT agrees with this assessment. RIOT IR CEO Jason Les verbalized it thusly on the 5/1/25 earnings call : [W]e continue to be very encouraged by the feedback that we've received not just from hyperscalers but potential financing partners, which will be critical in this development as well. And everyone continues to recognize the value of power that can be delivered in the near term. In this case, we're talking about 2026. The fact remains. There's approximately 5 gigawatts of data center capacity being used for generative AI today, and the forecast is we're going to need about 30 gigawatts by 2030. So that's a pretty big delta to fill in a pretty short period of time. And as a result, we continue to see strong demand. Bottom line: Demand for data centers isn’t shrinking. It’s soaring. Nobody should quibble with this as a chosen field for RIOT’s diversification efforts. Of course, that alone won’t support an investment case for RIOT. We need to go further. We can’t naively assume every data center venture will succeed. Introducing the Data Center Business… plus Location Location and Location In general, if you hear of a Bitcoin miner aspiring to data center work, start with a presumption of innocence. Bitcoin mining has a voracious appetite for power. Ditto modern AI- and HPC-oriented data centers. So, they’re compatible bedfellows. Focusing on AI, today’s main headline grabber, data needs vary. If you’re thinking about model training, think big… or rather HUGE! This is where we expose models to monstrous amounts of information. Using that data, the models learn how to recognize patterns, spit back old information, and answer new questions. Think of training as a university where AI models studied. (And as in human universities, there’s continuing education. New information/data is always being generated. So models need to keep updating their training. In human terms, we refer to this as lifelong learning ). Then, there’s inference. This is where graduates go out into the world, get jobs, and do regular work. This is about inference. It’s what you’re doing if you use ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, etc. It’s what Seeking Alpha does when it creates AI stock reports or Earnings Call Insights. Training tasks are monumental, but not necessarily frequent. Inference tasks tend to be smaller (by AI standards, which is still huge compared to non-AI tasks). But they’re frequent. Some data centers are huge. Others are smaller. Either way, we still need heretofore unimaginable amounts of power. Expect RIOT to work with larger centers. It’ll likely serve hyperscalers. (That term refers to the giants like Azure or Google Cloud). Geography plays a big role in that choice. Some parts of the country are better than others for big data centers. Electricity regulatory climates play a big role here. So, too, do access to good power sources and well-educated workforces. (See generally, here and here ). Number one is the Data Center Alley. That’s a nickname for a large northern Virginia concentration of data centers. RIOT is not there. But RIOT is right near Dallas Texas. That’s one of the Tier 1 U.S. data center markets. RIOT IR Dallas ranks number two , right behind Virginia. (See also, here ). Pivoting to Take Advantage of Its Texas-Sized Data Center Opportunity In 2022, RIOT bought a large land parcel, known as Corsicana, in Navarro County, Texas. It planned to create “ the world’s largest Bitcoin mining facility .” In May 2025, RIOT bought adjoining parcels. It thus more than doubled its Corsicana footprint. The latter … is part of Riot's plan to build large-scale data centers tailored for enterprise and hyperscale clients. CEO Jason Les emphasized that these data centers require significantly larger footprints than traditional mining operations, underscoring the company's ambition to diversify its revenue streams. To lead this initiative, Riot hired industry veteran Jonathan Gibbs as Chief Data Center Officer, signaling its commitment to expanding into the fast-growing market for AI-ready infrastructure. Here’s a visual presentation of the outcome of the land transactions. RIOT IR Les expects to serve big-league data center tenants at Corsicana: There are a number of hyperscalers and even large companies beyond hyperscalers that are in high need of power data center capacity to meet their growth targets. So I would say, especially because of the location of our site that allows it to be used for generative AI training, inference or cloud applications being 60 miles away from Dallas, a Tier 1 data center, there's a lot of different things you can do at that site. So our view is the whole hyperscaler landscape and beyond that are potential tenants in this -- for the Corsicana facility. As far as feedback, feedback from our advisers has matched really what we've gotten from tenants. And that's why we've been working on improving the land, adding water and additional fiber connectivity. These weren't things that were holding us back, but we've gotten feedback on what we can do to make the offering more compelling and put ourselves in the best position possible to be successful. As great as all this sounds, let’s maintain perspective… This is a development situation. It’s not a here-and-now money-geyser for RIOT. Even in Texas, as business-friendly as it is, it takes time to get something like this off the ground. Here are the results of the study RIOT conducted to assess what it can do with Corsicana. RIOT IR And here’s a sense of RIOT’s path forward in data centers. RIOT IR RIOT IR So as intriguing as RIOT seems, let’s now switch gears. We need to discuss topics that’ll help keep us away from the dreaded irrational exuberance… Numbers (To the Extent We Have Any Worth Examining) If you love numbers, you’ll hate RIOT. This is not a pre-revenue development entity. But neither is it an old-timer. It didn’t really get going, commerce-wise, until after the pandemic. Besides the small commercial sample, two more things make RIOT hard to quantitatively analyze. 1. Accounting for Bitcoin Operations Traditionally, companies had to write the value of bitcoin holding to account for any paper losses. OKI. Prices fall. Holdings lose value. I get it. But they were not allowed to write those values back up when Bitcoin prices recovered! Seriously! Finally, in late 2023, the accounting powers that be recognized how silly that was. So, they changed the rule to allow companies to write assets back up when appropriate. (It took effect in late 2024). Nice! Who could argue with more economic reality. But it still leaves workaday stock analysts in a quandary. Now we have two-way quarter-to-quarter profit fluctuations as bitcoin zigs and zags. Accounting standards setters pose no solutions for this volatility. I can’t think of anything either. So, it looks like we’ll just have to grit our collective teeth and cope. 2. RIOT’s Strategic Spending and Strategic Pivot Recall that Corsicana first became a gleam in RIOT’s corporate eye in 2022. It started out planning to seriously expand mining capabilities. Translation: big spending. And, of course, there’s the pivot to data centers. Translation: More spending. Numbers We Can Look At Given the above discussion, here are the only numbers I feel able to show you with a straight face. Analyst Compilation based on Data from Seeking Alpha Financial Presentations Notice the footnote below the table! You won’t be able to reconcile the operating margin I show with RIOT’s SEC documents. Nor will they match the income statement numbers Seeking Alpha presents based on what it gets from its data vendor. I did my own things there. I eliminated non-recurring items, especially the bitcoin valuation write-downs and write-ups. My solution is not perfect. I can’t eliminate bouncy numbers from ongoing Bitcoin transactions. (Even “Cash from Operations” is impacted). Let’s just say I’m doing the best I can. I think the best information you can extract from that table lies in the Cash etc. line and, in sections relating to Cash From Investing and Cash from Financing. You see the numerical equivalents to matters discussed above, mainly the expansion of mining and the pivot toward data centers. You also see that RIOT needs outside capital to keep going. That’s also so for many of today’s emerging companies. Risk Needless to say, the risk here is high. Conservative investors, look but don’t touch. Even risk-tolerant folks should size positions appropriately (i.e., small) relative to their total portfolio. Any in-development venture is necessarily risky. Will it succeed? I explained why I think RIOT will succeed. But until that actually happens, it’s a source of risk. Further… Dependence on infusions of outside capital is always risky. But the markets will likely oblige and give RIOT what it requires so long as its strategy and progress remain credible. (That’s how it is usually in situations like this. See, e.g., the financial strength discussion in my 5/21/24 CVNA writeup ). Helping, too, is RIOT’s willingness to get creative using its Bitcoin in terms of capital strategy. As Jason Chung, Head of Corporate Development and Strategy explained on the 5/1/25 earnings call (Note: ATM means at-the-market equity issuance): I think our financing activities this quarter could give a good sense of how we're thinking about all the different financing options that we have available to us. So we saw extremely limited use of the ATM, and therefore, very minimal dilution to our shareholders. When we did issue into the ATM, we achieved an average share price of $13.05 per share. So we feel pretty good about our timing when we did utilize the ATM on a limited basis. But in addition to that, we took two other steps, right? In April, we started selling our monthly Bitcoin production as well, raising additional funds that way. And now with the Coinbase facility, we've opened up another avenue of financing for us that, again, side steps the ATM. What to do About RIOT Stock Don’t even think in terms of valuation ratios. There are none here that are meaningful. Here’s the price chart. StockCharts.com There’s most recently been a lot of very positive sentiment toward RIOT. We see that in the way the 10-day exponential moving average ((EMA)) has been above and running away from the also strong 50-day EMA. We also see it in Chaikin Money Flow ((CMF)) and the Chaikin Oscillator (CO). Both measure which party to trade is more motivated. CMF does it for institutional investors. CO does it for the market in general. Both indicators have been very strong. Buyers being more motivated than sellers typically exerts upward pressure on stock prices. But trees don’t grow unabated to the sky. We have to expect a near-term breather. (We’ve seen big ups and downs before. We already see an indication of price fatigue in the very latest price bar next to the right-side edge.) All in all, nothing I see in the chart runs counter to my judgment regarding this stock. And in terms of that judgment… This is one of many emerging growth stocks today for which no meaningful valuation numbers can be calculated. It’s about the story. But it can’t be any story. It has to be a good story. And it has to be a credible story. My favorite example is value-guru William Miller’s very early investment into Amazon.com, Inc. ((AMZN)) almost on day one. I’ve described other examples on 1/12/25 with RGTI, and on 6/10/25 with QS. I see RIOT as one among that group. When it comes to rating stocks, I think in terms of probable future stock performance relative to the market, rather than literally buying, holding, or selling. And since I’m not rating based on a quant model, I’ll eschew “Strong…” extremes. Absent an exceptional degree of conviction, I think “Buy,” Hold,” or “Sell” are enough. I see RIOT as likely outperforming the broader 3- to 5-year market. I base this on the favorable stance I adopted lately towards crypto and bitcoin, and on my belief RIOT will succeed in its diversification plan. I translate that to the Seeking Alpha rating taxonomy by rating RIOT as a “Buy.”",RIOT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-09 12:00:18
47883121,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=175977,1752062425,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/47883121.jpeg,Bitcoin Acquisition: LQwD Unleashes $9M Private Placement for Explosive Crypto Growth,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/lqwd-bitcoin-acquisition-funding/,"In the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, strategic moves by innovative companies often signal significant shifts. One such development comes from LQWD Technologies Corp., a Canadian firm at the forefront of Bitcoin Lightning infrastructure. They’ve just announced a substantial upsizing of their private placement, securing a remarkable C$12.3 million (approximately $9 million USD). This isn’t just about raising capital; it’s a bold statement, primarily earmarked for a strategic Bitcoin acquisition and strengthening their position in the digital asset space. This move highlights a growing trend of companies embracing digital assets not just for operational purposes, but as a core treasury strategy. What does this mean for the future of Bitcoin, the Lightning Network, and the broader crypto market? What is This Landmark LQwD Technologies Investment? LQWD Technologies Corp., known for its pioneering work in developing and operating infrastructure for the Bitcoin Lightning Network, has successfully expanded its previously announced funding initiative. Initially, the company aimed for a smaller raise, but strong investor interest allowed them to significantly increase the offering. According to a press release distributed via GlobeNewswire, the total amount secured through both brokered and non-brokered private placements now stands at an impressive C$12.3 million, translating to roughly $9 million USD. This substantial capital injection serves a dual purpose. The primary allocation of the net proceeds is designated for the acquisition of Bitcoin. This decision reflects a strategic financial approach, leveraging Bitcoin as a core treasury asset, which many forward-thinking companies are now considering. Beyond Bitcoin holdings, a portion of the funds will also be directed towards general corporate purposes, ensuring LQwD has the necessary liquidity to continue its operational growth, research, and development efforts in the burgeoning crypto sector. This significant financial boost positions LQwD Technologies to further solidify its leadership in the Bitcoin Lightning space, providing crucial infrastructure that enhances Bitcoin’s scalability and utility. Why a Strategic Bitcoin Acquisition Now? The decision by LQwD Technologies to allocate a significant portion of its newly raised capital towards a direct Bitcoin acquisition is a compelling one, reflecting a broader trend of corporate adoption of digital assets. Why now, and what are the underlying strategic reasons for this move? Treasury Management: For many companies, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a robust alternative to traditional fiat currencies for treasury reserves. Its decentralized nature and fixed supply offer a hedge against inflation and currency debasement, making it an attractive long-term store of value. Alignment with Core Business: As a company deeply embedded in the Bitcoin ecosystem through its Lightning Network infrastructure, holding Bitcoin directly aligns with LQwD’s core mission and operational model. It demonstrates confidence in the asset they facilitate transactions for. Market Opportunity: Companies often time their Bitcoin acquisitions based on market conditions. While the crypto market can be volatile, strategic purchases during opportune moments can yield significant long-term returns, strengthening the company’s balance sheet. Enhanced Credibility: By holding Bitcoin, LQwD reinforces its commitment and belief in the future of Bitcoin and its underlying technology. This can enhance investor confidence and market perception, signaling a deep conviction in the digital economy. This strategic move goes beyond simply accumulating an asset; it’s about integrating Bitcoin into the very fabric of the company’s financial strategy, underscoring its belief in the asset’s enduring value and its role in the future of finance. How Does This Fuel the Lightning Network’s Potential? LQwD Technologies’ core business revolves around the Lightning Network , a second-layer payment protocol built on top of Bitcoin. This network aims to solve Bitcoin’s scalability issues by enabling faster, cheaper, and more frequent transactions. So, how does this substantial funding, particularly the Bitcoin acquisition, directly impact and fuel the Lightning Network’s potential? The Lightning Network relies on channels funded by Bitcoin. Companies like LQwD operate these nodes and channels, routing payments across the network. By acquiring more Bitcoin, LQwD can: Increase Channel Capacity: More Bitcoin means LQwD can open larger and more robust payment channels on the Lightning Network. This increases the total capacity of the network, allowing for larger individual transactions and more efficient routing. Enhance Network Liquidity: With greater Bitcoin holdings, LQwD can provide better liquidity across its nodes, ensuring that payments can be routed quickly and reliably without delays due to insufficient channel balances. This improves the overall user experience and reliability of Lightning payments. Strengthen Network Stability: A well-capitalized node operator with significant Bitcoin reserves contributes to the stability and decentralization of the Lightning Network. It reduces reliance on a few large entities and makes the network more resilient. Support Future Development: While a portion of funds is for Bitcoin, the general corporate purposes allocation directly supports the technical development and expansion of LQwD’s Lightning Network infrastructure. This includes improving node software, enhancing security, and exploring new features. Ultimately, this investment isn’t just about holding Bitcoin; it’s about empowering the infrastructure that makes Bitcoin more usable for everyday transactions, paving the way for a more scalable and efficient digital economy powered by the Lightning Network . Understanding the Private Placement Mechanism: What Does It Entail? The funding secured by LQwD Technologies comes in the form of an upsized private placement . But what exactly does a private placement mean, and how does it differ from other fundraising methods? A private placement is a direct offering of securities (like shares or convertible notes) to a select group of investors, rather than through a public offering on a stock exchange. This method is often chosen for several reasons: Speed and Efficiency: Private placements can be executed much faster than public offerings, as they involve fewer regulatory hurdles and less extensive documentation. Targeted Investors: Companies can handpick investors who understand their business model, vision, and long-term potential, often institutional investors, high-net-worth individuals, or strategic partners. Cost-Effectiveness: While fees are still involved, the overall costs associated with a private placement can be lower than a full-blown initial public offering (IPO) or secondary public offering. LQwD’s placement included both brokered and non-brokered components. A brokered private placement involves an investment bank or broker-dealer acting as an intermediary to find investors, while a non-brokered placement is conducted directly by the company without an intermediary. The upsizing from an initially planned smaller amount to C$12.3 million indicates strong investor confidence in LQwD’s strategy and the future of Bitcoin Lightning infrastructure. Here’s a simplified comparison of the private placement’s scale: Aspect Original Placement Size (Approx.) Upsized Private Placement (Approx.) Total Capital Raised C$7.5 million ($5.5 million USD) C$12.3 million ($9 million USD) Primary Use of Funds Bitcoin Acquisition, General Corporate Purposes Bitcoin Acquisition, General Corporate Purposes Investor Confidence Indication Moderate Strong This successful private placement underscores the market’s growing appetite for exposure to Bitcoin and the infrastructure supporting its evolution. Broader Implications for Crypto Investment and Corporate Strategy LQwD Technologies’ strategic move to acquire a significant amount of Bitcoin through an upsized private placement carries broader implications for the entire landscape of crypto investment and corporate strategy. This isn’t an isolated incident; it’s part of a burgeoning trend that reflects increasing institutional confidence in digital assets. What does this mean for the wider market? Validation of Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset: More companies are following the lead of pioneers like MicroStrategy, treating Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury reserve asset. This trend could accelerate as regulatory clarity improves and more traditional financial institutions offer crypto-related services. Growth in Bitcoin Infrastructure: Investments like LQwD’s directly support the underlying infrastructure that makes Bitcoin more usable. As the Lightning Network expands and becomes more robust, it enhances Bitcoin’s utility as a medium of exchange, not just a store of value. This makes Bitcoin a more attractive investment for both individuals and institutions. Increased Institutional Participation: The success of LQwD’s private placement indicates that institutional investors are actively seeking opportunities to gain exposure to the crypto space, particularly through companies building essential infrastructure. This influx of sophisticated capital can bring stability and maturity to the market. Precedent for Other Fintechs: LQwD’s approach could serve as a blueprint for other fintech firms looking to integrate digital assets more deeply into their business models and financial strategies. It showcases a viable path for leveraging private capital to pursue crypto-centric growth. Actionable Insights for Investors: For those observing the crypto market, LQwD’s move offers several insights: Look Beyond Spot Prices: While Bitcoin’s price movements are captivating, understanding the underlying infrastructure development (like the Lightning Network) and corporate adoption strategies provides a more holistic view of the market’s long-term health. Identify Enabling Technologies: Companies that build essential services and infrastructure for the crypto economy, like LQwD, can offer compelling investment opportunities as the sector matures. Monitor Corporate Treasury Trends: Keep an eye on public and private companies announcing Bitcoin acquisitions or crypto-related treasury strategies. These announcements can signal growing mainstream acceptance and potentially influence market dynamics. While the benefits are clear, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges. The crypto market remains volatile, and regulatory landscapes are still evolving. Companies undertaking such strategies must navigate these risks carefully. However, LQwD’s successful crypto investment and funding round signal a strong conviction in the long-term potential of Bitcoin and its supporting technologies. Conclusion: A Bold Step Towards a Bitcoin-Powered Future LQwD Technologies’ successful upsizing of its private placement to $9 million, primarily for a strategic Bitcoin acquisition, marks a pivotal moment for the company and a significant indicator for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem. This move not only fortifies LQwD’s balance sheet with a robust digital asset but also underscores its unwavering commitment to building and scaling the vital Bitcoin Lightning Network infrastructure. It reflects a growing trend of corporate confidence in Bitcoin as a fundamental asset and a strategic component of future-proof business models. By investing directly in Bitcoin and simultaneously enhancing its operational capacity, LQwD is positioning itself at the vanguard of the digital economy. This development signals that the integration of digital assets into mainstream corporate finance is not just a passing fad but a strategic imperative for innovation and growth. As companies like LQwD continue to push the boundaries, the vision of a more efficient, decentralized, and Bitcoin-powered financial future moves ever closer to reality.

Here’s What’s Lining Up,https://timestabloid.com/2025-could-be-historic-for-xrp-heres-whats-lining-up/,"XRP is poised for a potentially groundbreaking year in 2025 , driven by increasing institutional adoption, clearer regulations, and technological advancements that could solidify its position in the global financial landscape. As highlighted by Jungle Inc Crypto News, several major developments are unfolding simultaneously, each with the potential to propel XRP into the mainstream financial spotlight. Ripple’s U.S. Banking Ambitions Take Center Stage At the forefront is Ripple’s pursuit of a U.S. banking license. If approved, it would allow Ripple to operate as a federally regulated financial institution, unlocking new capabilities such as offering custody services, facilitating fiat payments, and directly integrating with the Federal Reserve’s payment systems. This move would represent a significant leap toward legitimizing Ripple—and by extension, XRP—as a central player in the evolving digital financial landscape. This year could be historic for XRP. Here’s what’s lining up: • Ripple’s U.S. banking license • Grayscale adds XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund • Up to 10 XRP spot ETF filings in progress • BlackRock rumored to be eyeing XRP ETF • XRP positioned as bridge asset for… — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) July 8, 2025 Institutional Confidence Returns with Grayscale’s Move In a major signal of growing institutional trust, Grayscale has re-added XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund . This marks a key reversal from its earlier exclusion of the token during Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Grayscale’s inclusion reflects renewed confidence in XRP’s regulatory standing, and it could influence other asset managers to follow suit. XRP Spot ETFs Are Gaining Momentum One of the most significant developments is the wave of new XRP spot ETF applications. As many as ten filings are reportedly in progress, as the success of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs opens the door for more digital assets. While no application has yet been approved , anticipation is building. Market rumors suggest that BlackRock, already a dominant force in ETF offerings, may be eyeing an XRP-based product. If confirmed, such a move could dramatically increase institutional exposure to XRP and catalyze significant price and liquidity growth.

Ripple is collaborating with governments and financial institutions to test XRP Ledger-based solutions for fast and affordable cross-border payments. With over 130 countries actively exploring CBDCs, XRP is well-positioned to become a key interoperability layer between national digital currencies. Robinhood and Bitstamp Join Forces on XRPL Adding another layer of momentum, Robinhood and Bitstamp are reportedly preparing to launch a derivatives exchange on the XRP Ledger. This platform would enable trading in futures and options directly on XRPL, blending decentralized finance with regulated financial products. If successful, it could drive significant activity to the network and further expand XRP’s utility beyond payments. A Defining Year Ahead As Jungle Inc Crypto News noted, “this isn’t hype, these are real moves.” The lineup of potential milestones for XRP in 2025 is not only impressive, it’s historic. From regulatory advancements and ETF speculation to cross-border utility and DeFi integration, the groundwork is being laid for a transformative year. Should even a portion of these developments come to fruition, XRP’s role in the global financial system could shift from promising to pivotal.

Price Jumps 11% but What’s Next?,https://cryptopotato.com/why-is-spx6900-pumping-price-jumps-11-but-whats-next/,"TL;DR SPX6900 price rallies 20% in a week, holding above key trendline with $94M in daily volume. Social dominance for the meme coin hits a 2-month high at 0.913%, reflecting increased online attention. Despite the price surge, active and new address counts fall, signaling reduced user participation. SPX6900 Extends Weekly Gains With Fresh Momentum SPX6900 (SPX) is trading at $1.42 as of press time, rising 8% in the past 24 hours. This move follows an earlier 11% increase, bringing its 7-day gain to around 20%. The current market cap stands at $1.32 billion, based on a circulating supply of 930 million tokens. Daily trading volume reached $94.4 million, with price action ranging between $1.28 and $1.44, based on Coingecko data. SPX6900 is still down 17.8% from its all-time high of $1.73, recorded on June 11, 2025. The broader trend remains upward, supported by recent market interest and social activity. Interestingly, according to Santiment, SPX6900’s social dominance has reached 0.913%, the highest level in over two months. This metric reflects the share of online discussions across major crypto media platforms related to SPX compared to other tokens. SPX6900 Social Dominance | Source: Santiment Meanwhile, the rise in visibility has coincided with stronger market performance. As the coin garners more attention, both new and existing traders appear more active, despite overall network activity showing some signs of slowing. SPX Holds Trendline Support as Resistance Nears The meme coin continues to follow a rising trendline that’s been in place since May, showing steady upward pressure. The price is hovering just below $1.36, a zone that has acted as resistance in recent weeks. This area also lines up with a key Fibonacci level, making it an important point for traders to watch. Source: TradingView If the price closes above $1.36 with volume, it could move toward $1.56, where previous rallies have stalled. The RSI is currently reading 58.29, which leans bullish without showing overbought conditions. Momentum remains intact as long as the price stays above the trendline. Any drop below $1.17 would weaken the structure. For now, buyers appear to be in control. Address Activity Trends Lower Despite Price Surge IntoTheBlock data shows total addresses have reached 1.56K. New addresses are at 172, though they have dropped by 8.44% over the last seven days. This points to slowing growth in new user participation. Active addresses have declined by 9.40% in the same period, with the count at 1.23K. Zero balance addresses are at 157, down 2.92%, which could reflect some user exits or consolidation of holdings. Despite falling address metrics, the price remains strong, driven by increased short-term interest. The post Why Is SPX6900 Pumping?

According to data in the Finbold H1 2025 Cryptocurrency Market Report , between January 1 and June 30, 2025, the number of total XRP addresses rose from 6,282,144 to 7,116,378, an increase of over 834,000. This growth was split across both quarters: Q1 accounted for 528,997 new addresses , while Q2 added another 305,237. Yet active address counts moved in the opposite direction, dropping from 39,515 to 26,807 by the end of the first half. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); That’s a net loss of 12,708 active wallets in Q2, on top of the 16,772 decline already reported in Q1. In other words, while more users are entering the XRP ecosystem on paper, fewer are interacting with the network regularly. The disconnect between new wallet creation and actual network activity suggests growing passive interest, possibly from investors parking funds or institutions onboarding for future use, rather than immediate participation with the network. XRP Q1 active address decline The Q1 decline came despite regulatory tailwinds, including SEC Chair Gary Gensler stepping down and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse stating that major legal overhangs had been resolved. At the time, unique active addresses fell from 39,515 to 22,743. !function(e,n,i,s){var d=""InfogramEmbeds"";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,""script"",""infogram-async"",""https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js""); Combined, these trends point to a 42.2% decline in active addresses during H1 2025, even as XRP’s price and institutional profile gained momentum. With new address growth outpacing actual network activity, the data raises fresh questions about the quality of engagement in the XRP ecosystem, and whether the influx of new users will eventually translate into sustainable usage.

For those deeply entrenched in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these technological advancements is crucial, as they often intersect with decentralized systems and the future of digital economies. A significant step forward comes from Hugging Face, a leading AI development platform , which has officially opened orders for its much-anticipated Reachy Mini desktop robots . This move isn’t just about new hardware; it’s about empowering a new generation of builders and fostering an open-source future for robotics, a philosophy that resonates strongly with the decentralized ethos of crypto. Hugging Face Robots: A New Era for AI Development Hugging Face, widely recognized for its contributions to the artificial intelligence landscape, is now extending its influence into tangible hardware. The announcement marks a pivotal moment for developers eager to bridge the gap between AI models and physical interaction. Initially unveiled as prototypes in May alongside the larger humanoid robot, HopeJR, the Reachy Mini Hugging Face robots are now ready to be shipped, allowing enthusiasts and professionals alike to begin hands-on experimentation. These compact yet powerful devices are designed to be accessible and highly programmable, reflecting Hugging Face’s commitment to democratizing AI. The company is offering two distinct versions to cater to different developer needs: Reachy Mini Wireless: Priced at $449, this version offers complete freedom of movement, running on a Raspberry Pi 5 mini-computer. Its wireless capability makes it ideal for dynamic testing environments or simply moving around a workspace. Reachy Mini Lite: A more budget-friendly option at $299, this version requires a wired connection to a computing source. It’s perfect for developers who prefer a stationary setup or have existing computing resources readily available. Both models are delivered as a kit, inviting developers to engage directly with the assembly process. This hands-on approach ensures a deeper understanding of the robot’s mechanics and encourages customization from the ground up. Meet the Reachy Mini: Your New Desktop Robotics Companion The Reachy Mini is more than just a piece of hardware; it’s an interactive canvas for AI innovation. Roughly the size of a standard stuffed animal, these delightful desktop robots feature two screens for expressive eyes and two antennas, giving them a friendly and approachable demeanor. Once assembled, the true power of the Reachy Mini comes to life: full programmability in Python. This Python integration is a game-changer, as it’s one of the most popular languages for AI and robotics development, making the Reachy Mini accessible to a vast community of coders. Furthermore, each device comes with a set of pre-installed demos, allowing users to quickly get started and explore its capabilities. A core advantage is its seamless integration with the Hugging Face Hub, the company’s vast open-source machine learning platform. This integration grants users immediate access to an incredible repository of over 1.7 million AI models and more than 400,000 datasets, providing an unparalleled resource for building sophisticated applications. The Power of Open-Source Robotics: Why It Matters Hugging Face CEO, Clém Delangue, shared insights with Bitcoin World, revealing that the decision to launch two versions of the Reachy Mini was directly influenced by initial user feedback on their original prototype. Delangue recounted a poignant anecdote about an early tester whose five-year-old daughter wanted to carry the desktop robot around the house. This feedback highlighted a clear demand for portability and user-centric design. “The goal in the future is to keep carefully getting a lot of feedback like that from users, from the community, that’s how we’ve always been building products at Hugging Face as an open source community platform,” Delangue stated. This philosophy underpins the entire project. The inherent nature of the open-source robotics design means that “people will be able to extend it, modify it, change everything they want.” This collaborative approach fosters rapid innovation and ensures the technology evolves in line with community needs and desires, much like the collaborative development seen in many blockchain projects. Empowering AI Developers: Building the Future Together Delangue emphasized that the primary target audience for these devices is dedicated AI developers . The Reachy Minis provide a unique sandbox for coding, building, and rigorously testing AI applications in a physical environment. This hands-on experience is invaluable for understanding the nuances of real-world robotics. “Anyone will be able to build their own specific features and apps for Reachy Mini that then they’ll be able to share with the community,” Delangue explained. This vision extends beyond individual projects; it aims to cultivate a vibrant ecosystem where creativity flourishes. “So we hope that it’s really going to unleash the creativity of builders to build, you know, millions of different applications, millions of different features that they can share with the community, so that anyone can then, like, plug and play with it.” This emphasis on community-driven development and shareable applications mirrors the collaborative spirit often found in open-source blockchain initiatives, where shared codebases drive collective progress. Availability and the Vision Ahead Developers won’t have to wait long to get their hands on these innovative robots. The Reachy Mini Lite is slated to begin shipping next month, with the wireless version following later this year. Delangue highlighted the importance of a swift shipping process, opting against lengthy pre-order timelines to ensure the robots reach users as quickly as possible. This commitment to rapid deployment reflects a desire to accelerate development and feedback cycles within the community. This release aligns perfectly with Hugging Face’s broader vision for its robotics program: to champion open-source hardware that grants users complete control. “I feel like it’s really important for the future of robotics to be open source, instead of being closed source, black box, [and] concentrated in the hands of a few companies,” Delangue asserted. He articulated a compelling argument for decentralized control in robotics, drawing parallels to concerns about centralized power in other technological domains. “I think it’s quite a scary world to have like millions of robots in people’s home controlled by one company, with customers, users, not really being able to control them, understand them. I would much rather live in a place, or in a world, or in a country, where everyone can have some control over the robots.” This strong advocacy for user autonomy and transparency resonates deeply with the core principles of decentralization championed by the cryptocurrency community. A Glimpse into an Open Future The launch of the Hugging Face Reachy Mini desktop robots is more than just a product release; it’s a statement about the future of AI and robotics. By embracing an open-source, community-driven approach, Hugging Face is not only making advanced robotics more accessible but also fostering an environment where innovation can truly thrive. For AI developers , this means unprecedented opportunities to experiment, build, and share, contributing to a collective intelligence that will shape the next generation of intelligent machines. The emphasis on user control and transparency echoes the very foundations of decentralized technologies, suggesting a harmonious path forward where powerful AI tools are democratized, not monopolized.

A significant development from the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MOEF) in South Korea is set to reshape how companies approach their tax obligations. This crucial clarification regarding South Korea crypto tax specifically addresses the valuation of virtual assets received as compensation for validator participation, marking a pivotal moment for compliance in the nation’s burgeoning digital economy. Understanding the MOEF’s Stance on Validator Rewards What exactly does this new directive from South Korea’s MOEF mean for companies? Simply put, if your business is involved in validating transactions on a blockchain or acting as a governance partner, the virtual assets you earn as compensation are now subject to a specific valuation method for tax purposes. The MOEF’s Corporate Tax Division, through the National Tax Law Information System, has unequivocally stated that these newly issued tokens must be reported based on their market value at the time they are received . This isn’t just a minor administrative detail; it’s a fundamental principle for accurate tax reporting. Let’s break down the key elements of this clarification: Scope: Applies to domestic companies receiving virtual assets as compensation. Role: Specifically targets those serving as validators or governance partners under contracts with foreign virtual asset platforms. Valuation Method: The acquisition value of these tokens must be determined by their prevailing market price on the day they are received. This guidance brings a much-needed framework to the often-ambiguous area of crypto earnings, particularly for those contributing to network security and governance. For businesses engaging in activities that generate validator rewards , understanding this specific requirement is the first step towards ensuring compliance and avoiding future complications. Why the MOEF Virtual Asset Valuation Matters The MOEF’s insistence on market value at the time of receipt isn’t arbitrary; it aligns with standard accounting principles for income recognition. When a company earns compensation, whether in fiat currency or digital assets, that income needs to be valued consistently for tax purposes. Prior to this clear guidance, there might have been ambiguity regarding how to account for volatile virtual assets, leading to potential discrepancies in corporate tax filings. This clarity from the MOEF virtual asset division helps in several ways: Ensuring Fair Taxation: It ensures that the taxable income accurately reflects the economic value received by the company at the moment of earning. Preventing Arbitrage: It closes potential loopholes where companies might try to value assets at a lower historical cost or at a later, more convenient price point. Promoting Transparency: It provides a clear, verifiable method for companies to report their digital asset income, enhancing overall transparency in the crypto sector. For businesses operating within the dynamic crypto space, particularly those generating revenue through staking, validating, or providing governance services, this ruling necessitates a robust system for tracking the exact time of receipt and the corresponding market price of every virtual asset earned. This level of precision is vital for accurate financial reporting and tax declarations. Navigating Crypto Taxation Rules for Companies This MOEF directive is part of a broader effort by South Korea to establish comprehensive crypto taxation rules . As the digital asset market matures, governments worldwide are grappling with how to effectively regulate and tax this new asset class. South Korea, being a hub for technological innovation and cryptocurrency adoption, is at the forefront of developing these frameworks. For domestic companies, this means more than just valuing validator rewards. It requires a holistic understanding of how various crypto-related activities are taxed. Key considerations include: Income Recognition: How and when different types of crypto income (trading profits, mining rewards, staking rewards, airdrops, etc.) are recognized. Cost Basis: Establishing the correct cost basis for virtual assets to calculate capital gains or losses upon sale. Record Keeping: Maintaining meticulous records of all transactions, including dates, values, and counter-parties. Cross-Border Implications: Navigating tax obligations when dealing with foreign platforms or international transactions. The MOEF’s latest clarification underscores a growing trend towards greater scrutiny and formalization of crypto income. Companies should proactively engage with tax professionals specializing in digital assets to ensure their compliance strategies are up-to-date and robust. Ignoring these evolving rules can lead to significant penalties and legal challenges. The Challenge of Digital Asset Valuation at Receipt While the principle of valuing virtual assets at market price upon receipt is clear, its practical implementation can present challenges, especially given the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies. How does a company accurately determine the market price of a newly issued token at a precise moment? Here are some common challenges and potential solutions for accurate digital asset valuation : Challenge Description Potential Solution Price Volatility Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate wildly within minutes or even seconds. Utilize reliable, real-time data feeds from multiple reputable exchanges; consider using an average price over a very short window (e.g., 5 minutes) around the receipt time if precise second-by-second data is impractical. Illiquid Assets Newly issued or niche tokens may not have a broad market or readily available price data. Refer to prices on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or over-the-counter (OTC) desks if available. If no market exists, a fair valuation might require expert appraisal or a cost-plus approach, though this is less preferred by tax authorities. Time of Receipt Pinpointing the exact “time of receipt” on a blockchain can be technical, especially for automated rewards. Implement automated tracking systems that log transaction timestamps from the blockchain explorer or the platform providing the rewards. Ensure these systems are robust and auditable. Multiple Platforms Companies may receive rewards from various foreign virtual asset platforms, each with different reporting mechanisms. Standardize internal record-keeping processes across all platforms. Consolidate data into a central system for comprehensive reporting. The MOEF’s guidance emphasizes the need for companies to adopt sophisticated accounting practices and potentially leverage specialized crypto tax software to manage these complexities. Proactive planning and investment in appropriate tools will be crucial for compliance. South Korea’s Ministry of Economy and Finance has issued a vital clarification that brings greater certainty to the taxation of virtual assets earned as validator rewards. By mandating the use of market value at the time of receipt, the MOEF aims to ensure fair, transparent, and accurate corporate tax reporting in the rapidly expanding digital asset sector. This move reinforces South Korea’s commitment to developing clear crypto taxation rules and sets a precedent for how other jurisdictions might approach similar challenges. For domestic companies engaged in blockchain validation or governance, this is a call to action. Review your current accounting practices, ensure your systems can accurately capture the market value of every virtual asset received, and consult with tax experts to navigate these evolving requirements. Embracing these guidelines will not only ensure compliance but also foster a more mature and trusted environment for digital asset businesses in South Korea.

(NASDAQ: OSRH), a global healthcare company advancing biomedical and wellness innovation, today announced the official roadmap for a targeted $50 million security token offering (STO) planned for launch in the second half of 2025 under Regulation D of the U.S. Securities Act. The token, with the working title OSRT, will be a securitized digital asset representing OSR Holdings’ equity exposure and is designed to align with the company’s blockchain-based capital strategy. As part of this roadmap, Taekwondo Access Credit (TAC)—a utility token that rewards participation and has growing adoption in the global Taekwondo community —will be accepted alongside Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT) as eligible currencies for subscription to the OSRT offering. Taekwondo remains one of the world’s most widely practiced martial arts, with an estimated 70 million practitioners of all ages across 190 countries. TAC has been selected as one of the subscription tokens for the upcoming STO, alongside BTC and USDT, for its possible real-world utility with blood glucose monitoring devices, details of which OSRH intends to announce in a forthcoming press release. BCM Europe intends to convert a substantial portion of its TAC holdings into BTC or USDT through market-based transactions prior to its anticipated participation. Due to the convertibility of TAC into OSRT and to ensure compliance and mitigate potential insider trading concerns, BCM Europe AG, the issuer of TAC and the largest shareholder of OSRH, w ill not be permitted to use TAC directly in subscribing to the OSRT offering. Other interested and eligible subscribers of OSRT will be able to use BTC, USDT, or TAC to acquire OSRT tokens. “Our upcoming STO is not just a tokenization of our equity – it’s a foundational element of our long-term capital and treasury strategy,” said Peter Hwang , CEO of OSRH. “We believe that our combined $50 million STO plan and $80 million equity line of credit (ELOC) from White Lion GBM Innovation Fund provides a credible and achievable path towards building a $100 million Bitcoin and USDT reserve on our balance sheet.” Key Elements of the OSRT Security Token Roadmap: Plan for up to $50 Million STO Under Reg D : OSR Holdings aims to raise up to $50 million in digital assets via the OSRT token in the second half of 2025, offered under Regulation D, targeting accredited investors. Eligibility of BTC, USDT, and TAC : OSRT will be offered to accredited investors who may subscribe using BTC, USDT, or TAC, enabling diversified participation and aligning with OSRH’s existing blockchain ecosystem partnerships. Special Restrictions for BCM Europe AG : While TAC will be accepted from eligible investors in the STO, BCM Europe AG, as the issuer of TAC and a major shareholder of OSR Holdings, will not be permitted to subscribe using TAC directly. Instead, BCM Europe will convert its TAC holdings into BTC or USDT through market-based transactions, a process designed to avoid conflicts of interest and align with best practices on insider participation. ELOC-Backed Liquidity Plan : In parallel to the STO, OSR Holdings continues to draw from its $80 million ELOC from White Lion GBM Innovation Fund, further reinforcing its capital base and enabling the company to scale its crypto holdings toward a realistic $100 million reserve. Crypto-Healthcare Convergence Strategy : OSRH is integrating decentralized finance with healthcare innovation, supported by its unique ecosystem that includes TAC, which is already actively used within the global Taekwondo community. Additional announcements on TAC real-world integration with digital healthcare are planned for 3Q2025. “This roadmap represents a significant evolution in how public healthcare companies can engage with digital finance,” said Chris Bang , Chief Financial Officer of O SRH. “By structuring this offering with both transparency and accessibility in mind, we aim to reach a new generation of investors while maintaining regulatory discipline and operational integrity.” About OSR Holdings, Inc.

Most of those who haven’t tried it yet would like to do so in the future, according to the poll that also found that they prefer to convert Russian rubles into digital coins. 90% of qualified Russian investors attracted to crypto A sizable majority of Russian investors allowed to legally trade crypto have either acquired cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or plan to do that. That’s according to a recent study carried out amid a growing crypto turnover in Russia. The results published by the business daily Vedomosti this week show that 52% of qualified investors in the country already have experience with cryptocurrency instruments, the crypto news outlet Bits.media reported. Another 38% of the respondents haven’t tried crypto yet, but they are willing to do so. That means that a total of 90% of those in the studied sample signal interest in decentralized digital assets in terms of investment opportunities. The survey was conducted among 1,500 men and women over the age of 20 in Russian cities with a population exceeding 100,000 people. All participants are qualified investors with financial assets of at least 50,000 rubles (approx. $600) in their possession. Russia is yet to comprehensively regulate operations with cryptocurrencies, but its main financial regulators, the Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance, have made it clear they do not intend to admit every Russian to the crypto market. In March, the central bank proposed to permit a limited number of investors to buy and sell digital coins under a special “experimental legal regime.” The monetary authority insisted these should only be “ highly qualified investors .” To be granted this status, private individuals would need to prove annual income of at least 50 million rubles (over $600,000) and investments in securities or deposits exceeding 100 million rubles (more than $1.2 million), although these thresholds are still to be officially approved. While the Central Bank of Russia itself is not planning to add Bitcoin to its reserves, it announced in May that qualified investors are free to buy crypto derivatives, including securities with yields tied to cryptocurrency prices, as long as these are non-deliverable. A number of Russian financial institutions have since joined the race to offer clients such products . Among them is Russia’s largest stock market, the Moscow Exchange, which recently unveiled that it will launch a crypto futures contract based on its own new Bitcoin index . Russians keep buying Bitcoin, defying restrictive rules Despite the opposition of financial authorities in Moscow against allowing ordinary Russians to purchase cryptocurrencies, a recent estimate indicated that Russian citizens have already acquired well over $25 billion worth of crypto assets. Around 60% of the respondents in the new study quoted by the Russian press expect interest in cryptocurrency-based products to increase as a result of the growing offering of such instruments from established companies. They highlight the reliability of service providers as a key factor for their decisions (43%), along with low fees (24%) and convenient deposits and withdrawals (24%), noted analysts at the Russian investment firm BCS, who compiled the report. The survey also found that the main motives for getting hold of crypto instruments include long-term investments (57% of respondents), portfolio diversification (32%), and short-term speculation (25%). The authors detail further: “Currently, 33% of investors have 5-10% of their portfolios invested in instruments related to crypto assets.” A clear majority among the polled Russian investors, 78%, prefer the services of domestic platforms registered in Russia’s jurisdiction. Most investors, 85%, also like using Russian rubles to top up their investment accounts. Insufficient knowledge about digital assets and the high volatility of cryptocurrencies have been singled out as the main barriers to investing in crypto-linked financial instruments.

33767162,[object Object],1752064242,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Here’s What Ripple CEO Garlinghouse Is About To Tell US Senate Today,https://bitcoinist.com/what-ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-tell-us-senate-today/,"Ripple chief executive Brad Garlinghouse will ask US lawmakers to “put the country on the path to being a global blockchain and crypto leader” when he testifies this morning before the Senate Banking Committee’s hearing on “From Wall Street to Web3: Building Tomorrow’s Digital Asset Markets.” His prepared remarks, obtained in advance, frame the session as a choice between regulatory clarity that keeps innovation onshore and a continuation of regulation-by-enforcement” that drives talent abroad. What Ripple Wants Lawmakers To Hear Garlinghouse opens by reminding senators that Ripple was created “more than a decade ago with a mission: to enable the Internet of Value — a world where money moves like information does today”. He describes the XRP Ledger as “decentralized, battle-tested” infrastructure that already powers “fast, low-cost and highly scalable” cross-border payments for banks worldwide . Ripple, he notes, operates under “over 60 payment service, crypto and money-transmitter licenses” precisely because it “made the deliberate choice to work with policymakers and regulators — not around them”. The core of the testimony is an indictment of Washington’s policy vacuum. “For the last decade, the legal and regulatory uncertainty surrounding crypto has prohibited meaningful progress in the US,” Garlinghouse warns, arguing that the absence of clear rules “has been weaponized to target good actors” and is “pushing technology, jobs and tax dollars offshore , reducing regulatory oversight and putting consumers at higher risk”. He cites Ripple’s own four-year litigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission as emblematic. The 2020 SEC lawsuit , he recalls, made Ripple “the tip of the spear of this regulation-by-enforcement campaign,” yet the company ultimately prevailed: “The court ruled in our favor on everything that mattered — including finding that the token XRP is not, in and of itself, a security”. That outcome, he contends, opened the door for other US crypto firms to fight back. Garlinghouse then lays out three legislative priorities: 1) clear jurisdictional boundaries among regulators, 2) workable pathways for companies to build in the United States without sacrificing investor safeguards, and 3) a framework that lets America “be a global leader in crypto by taking full advantage of the benefits and efficiencies brought by digital assets and blockchain technologies”. With an estimated 55 million US crypto users and a $3.4 trillion global market capitalization on the line, he argues, the stakes are national—not merely corporate. “Speaking on behalf of the entire crypto industry, I urge you to prioritize the passage of market-structure legislation for digital assets through this Committee and the full Senate,” Garlinghouse tells lawmakers, predicting that such a step would “catalyze a new era of US competitiveness and unlock efficiencies in financial transactions”. He closes with a challenge: “There is no reason we should not be the undisputed leader in digital assets and blockchain”. Whether those words move the legislative needle will become clearer as the hearing unfolds, but Garlinghouse’s testimony sets the tone: cooperation over confrontation, clarity over uncertainty—and a blunt warning that the window for US leadership is narrowing fast.
