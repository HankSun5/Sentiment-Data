In a new interview on the Altcoin Daily YouTube channel, Mark Yusko names his top token picks, including prominent smart contract platforms Solana ( SOL ) and Cardano ( ADA ). Other digital assets on the executive’s list include XRP , the digital asset associated with Ripple Labs, meme asset Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and layer-1 blockchain Hedera ( HBAR ). “I’ve become pretty partial to Solana, I got to say it. I mean, the guys have done a good job convincing me and you know, thankfully we didn’t sell our last bag and it’s gone from $13 to $240 or whatever so it’s pretty good.” Yusko goes on to say that if he had “money to lose,” he’d bet on ADA, XRP, and HBAR as some firms in the traditional finance (TradFi) world may eventually adopt the crypto assets to not get left behind. “If I had money that I was willing to lose – because I think you could literally lose it – I might actually own a little bit of [ADA, HBAR, and XRP] because… Depending on how this ‘czar’ position and all that stuff plays out, could I see a world in which, as a bridge to the future – meaning the incumbents don’t want to be displaced tomorrow – they say ‘You know what? Fine we’ll use XRP or we’ll use some Hedera thing and we’ll be crypto.'” Concluding with DOGE, Yusko says not owning the top meme token is a bet against billionaire Elon Musk. “Don’t bet against Elon, obviously. DOGE probably is not the dumbest thing in the world. I thought it was pretty dumb all the way from $0 to $60 billion so jokes on me, I’m the dumb one, but anyway, that’s probably it.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

With its impressive performance, it seems likely that the bulls will carry this rally until it reaches the $3 mark. Will the XRP Price Rally Continue? Following XRP’s latest achievement, participation from whales and investors has skyrocketed and is raising one common question – Will this rally continue, or is there a chance of a price correction in the coming days? $256M of XRP Inflow, Sell-off Incoming? The on-chain analytics firm Coinglass recently reported that amid the ongoing bull rally, whales and institutions have been consistently dumping millions of dollars worth of XRP onto exchanges. According to Coinglass’s XRP spot inflow/outflow data, exchanges have witnessed a significant inflow of $256.30 million in the past three days. Source: Coinglass This substantial inflow suggests that whales and institutions have transferred their holdings to exchanges. In the cryptocurrency landscape, such inflows typically indicate a potential sell-off and an impending price decline. Traders Strong Bests on Long Side In addition to whale participation, traders appear more optimistic, strongly betting on long positions, as indicated by Coinglass. At press time, the XRP Long/Short ratio on the four-hour timeframe stands at 1.98, indicating a strong bullish sentiment among traders. Currently, 66.5% of top traders across exchanges hold long positions, while 33.5% hold short positions. This data indicates that, in the short term, bulls are dominating the altcoin, which could support XRP in continuing its rally toward $3. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level An analysis of these on-chain metrics suggests that bulls are currently in control, potentially supporting XRP’s price and ongoing rally. However, the activity of whales and institutions, along with the $256.30 million worth of XRP offloaded, signals a potential price correction in the coming days. XRP Price Prediction According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, XRP has broken through the highly anticipated resistance level of $2. Following this breakout, there is a strong possibility that it could soar to $3.15 in the coming days. However, the price could experience a minor correction or a breakout retest before the rally continues toward the $3 mark. Source: Trading View Currently, XRP is trading near $2.17 and has registered a price gain of over 15% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume decreased by 14%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-01 21:01:57

Five digital coins are poised for potential explosive growth, offering the chance for remarkable returns. This article delves into these promising assets that could deliver astonishing gains by Christmas. CYBRO Presale Soars Past $5.5 Million: A One-in-a-Million NeoBank Investment Opportunity CYBRO is capturing the attention of crypto whales as its exclusive token presale quickly surges above $5.5 million. This cutting-edge NeoBank offers investors unparalleled opportunities to enhance crypto earnings across multiple blockchains. The presale has now reached its 8th stage out of 10, marking the final opportunity to acquire CYBRO tokens at the presale price of just $0.045 each. With only two stages remaining, time is running out to invest before the Token Generation Event (TGE), where prices are expected to skyrocket. Experts are forecasting a potential ROI of 1200%, solidifying CYBRO’s status as a transformative opportunity in the DeFi and NeoBank sectors. In addition to tokens, CYBRO introduces special Points, offering even more opportunities for investors. Holders of these Points will automatically participate in the CYBRO Airdrop, where the more Points you hold, the more tokens you will receive. CYBRO distributes up to 1 million Points weekly, which can be earned by investing in DeFi Vaults in the CYBRO app. Holders of CYBRO tokens will enjoy lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, cashback on purchases, reduced trading and lending fees, and a robust insurance program within the platform. With only 21% of the total tokens available for this presale and approximately 80 million already sold, this is a golden opportunity for savvy investors to secure a stake in a project that's truly one in a million. >>>Join CYBRO and aim for future returns up to 1200% Solana's Scalable Blockchain: Discovering SOL's Role in Dapps Development Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It provides a base for decentralized applications, known as dapps. Competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana aims for faster transactions through its unique architecture. It supports development in multiple programming languages, making it flexible for developers. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana. It is essential to the ecosystem. SOL is used for transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding those who support the network. The coin holds value as it powers the Solana ecosystem and gives users access to various projects. Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Instead, it attracts developers and investors with its high-capacity network. Avalanche (AVAX): A Layer-1 Blockchain Offering Speed and Customization Avalanche (AVAX) is a Layer-1 blockchain platform that provides eco-friendly operations, low transaction fees, and high-speed processing with a capacity of 4,500 transactions per second. It enables users to launch customizable Subnets for tailored blockchain deployments. Avalanche employs a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto consensus principles, achieving transaction finality in less than two seconds. The platform consists of three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—that manage various functions like transactions and smart contract executions. AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by covering transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and facilitating the operation of multiple Subnets, supporting payments, staking, and the creation of custom tokens and blockchains. Polkadot's DOT: Enhancing Blockchain Connectivity and Scalability Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. It allows value and data to be shared without intermediaries. By using parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing transactions much faster than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Polkadot token (DOT) is used for governance and staking within its network, allowing holders to participate in the protocol's development and transaction verification. Developed by Ethereum co-creator Gavin Wood and maintained by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot aims to create more interconnected and efficient blockchains. Introducing POL: Powering the Polygon Ecosystem The Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL) is a utility token at the core of the Polygon network. It facilitates a range of operations and services across the ecosystem. Holders can stake their tokens, participating in network security and consensus, and earn additional tokens based on the amount staked. POL also enables governance, giving holders the right to vote on proposals that influence the development and direction of the network. Additionally, it grants access to exclusive services within the ecosystem, unlocking special features and applications. With its wide array of use cases, POL plays a crucial role in the growth and functionality of the Polygon ecosystem. Conclusion In conclusion, while SOL, AVAX, DOT, and POL show potential, their short-term prospects seem limited. In contrast, CYBRO stands out as an advanced DeFi platform offering investors exceptional opportunities to boost earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With features like generous staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO provides a superior user experience with smooth deposits and withdrawals. Focusing on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO has attracted significant interest from major crypto investors and influencers, marking it as a promising project in the current bull run.

Will Trump’s deregulation do it again?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/lack-of-oversight-crashed-crypto-once-will-trumps-deregulation-do-it-again/,"The last crypto crash didn’t happen because there were too many rules. It happened because there were barely any. Back in 2022, crypto giants treated the market like a game board. Risky bets, shady leverage, and zero accountability made them billions until it all fell apart. Companies like Terraform, FTX, and Celsius went down in flames, leaving ordinary investors broke. Fast forward to today. Trump’s win has the crypto industry popping champagne. Bitcoin prices have surged nearly 40%, brushing against $100,000. The market cap has jumped by over $1 trillion. The president, once a critic of crypto, is now its loudest cheerleader. He’s promised to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” But with promises of deregulation and industry-friendly policies, skeptics can’t help but wonder if Trump’s crypto revolution is setting the stage for another collapse. The push for less regulation The industry spent over $100 million on the election—almost half of all corporate political spending. It seems to be paying off. Reports say Trump is letting crypto insiders pick the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Gary Gensler, the current SEC chair and a proud crypto hater, plans to step down before Trump takes office. The president had said publicly he’d fire Gensler on day one. Elon Musk, Trump’s ally and crypto enthusiast, has joined the fight for deregulation. He took to his X platform (formerly Twitter) to call for the “deletion” of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency designed to protect consumers from financial scams. According to Elon, the U.S. has “too many duplicative regulatory agencies.” His comment got cheers from crypto fans who see government oversight as the enemy of innovation. Of course, the billionaire’s influence in the crypto industry doesn’t stop with tweets. Dogecoin, the meme coin he’s championed, has skyrocketed 150% since Trump’s election victory. Why? Because “DOGE” is now shorthand for the “Department of Government Efficiency,” Elon’s new agency. Trump’s personal ties to crypto Trump’s sons are involved in World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture that stands to benefit from favorable regulations. Critics say this creates a conflict of interest. Trump’s policies could directly enrich his family while manipulating the market. And it’s not just his family. Crypto titans are backing Trump with both money and influence. The $100 million they funneled into the election wasn’t charity. They want a return on their investment, starting with lenient rules and friendlier regulators. If Trump delivers, it could turn the U.S. into a haven for crypto innovation—or a playground for unchecked greed. The stakes are higher now than in 2021. Back then, crypto was largely isolated from traditional finance. Its crashes didn’t get far beyond the market. That’s not the case anymore. The SEC’s recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has tethered crypto to the global financial system. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has already attracted $48 billion, drawing in hedge funds, retirement accounts, and institutional investors. This integration makes the market more vulnerable. A crypto collapse today would likely affect banks, pensions, and the global economy itself.",OP-ED|BTC|USA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-01 21:20:34

The crypto landscape is ever-evolving, and meme coins have carved out an intriguing niche. They’re not just about fun and games; they represent a unique blend of community spirit and investment potential. In this article, we’ll dive into some exciting new players, including BTFD Coin, Cat in a Dog’s World, and Act I: The AI Prophecy, and explore what makes them stand out in this crowded space. One of the most thrilling newcomers on the block is BTFD Coin, which has already made waves with its presale success. In just 24 hours, it raised over $200,000, and now, in the 5th stage of its presale, it has surpassed $420,000, selling more than 10 billion coins to over 1000 holders. The enthusiasm around BTFD Coin is palpable, and it’s clear that this project is poised for greatness. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, it’s designed to engage a wide audience and encourage community involvement through various incentives like staking rewards and gaming features. In contrast, we’ll also look at established players like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, which have solidified their positions as top contenders in the meme coin arena. These projects have been around for a while, yet they continue to attract attention and investment, serving as alternative assets in a volatile market. Understanding their journey can provide valuable insights into what makes a meme coin successful and how new entries like BTFD Coin can learn from their strategies. BTFD Coin: The Next-Gen Meme Coin Supremo BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin; it’s a phenomenon that’s capturing the hearts and wallets of investors. With its presale hitting the ground running, BTFD Coin has sold over 10 billion coins, attracting over 1000 holders, raising more than $420,000 in the process. But what truly sets it apart? For starters, the presale is currently in its 5th stage, with the 6th stage set to unlock once 15 billion coins are sold. The current price of $0.00005 is a bargain compared to the projected presale end price of $0.0006, suggesting a 14900% ROI for early investors. What’s more, BTFD Coin has a unique Play2Earn game that encourages user engagement and offers real rewards. Imagine playing a fun game while earning coins—sounds like a win-win, right? This gamification aspect appeals particularly to younger audiences, who are increasingly drawn to interactive investment opportunities. The staking rewards further enhance its attractiveness, allowing holders to earn passive income simply by holding their coins. Community engagement is at the heart of BTFD Coin’s strategy. For instance, the project allocates 17% of its maximum supply to Rage Bull Gaming Rewards, which not only incentivises participation but also helps in building a robust community around the coin. This creates a sense of belonging, turning casual investors into dedicated supporters Cat in a Dog’s World: A New Contender Next up, we have Cat in a Dog’s World, a fresh face in the meme coin scene that’s generating buzz for its innovative approach. This project is all about breaking the norms and offering something different. It taps into the playful rivalry between cats and dogs, creating a narrative that resonates with pet lovers and meme enthusiasts alike. What sets Cat in a Dog’s World apart is its community-driven ethos. It encourages holders to participate in various activities, from social media campaigns to local meet-ups, fostering a sense of camaraderie among its users. This approach not only builds a loyal following but also increases visibility in the crowded crypto market. Moreover, Cat in a Dog’s World has implemented features that allow holders to earn rewards through participation in community events and initiatives. This engagement helps to create a vibrant ecosystem where users feel valued and involved. Imagine being part of a community where your love for pets translates into tangible rewards—it’s an enticing proposition for many. As we look at the broader market, it’s clear that Cat in a Dog’s World is vying for a spot alongside the heavyweights. Its unique branding and community focus may just be the ticket to establishing itself as one of the best new meme coins to buy in December 2024. Act I: The AI Prophecy: Blending Technology with Meme Culture Lastly, let’s dive into Act I: The AI Prophecy. This project uniquely combines cutting-edge AI technology with the playful energy of meme culture. It’s an ambitious undertaking that seeks to harness the power of artificial intelligence to enhance user experience and engagement within the crypto space. Act I offers a distinctive proposition: it uses AI algorithms to analyse market trends and user behaviour, providing invaluable insights to its community. This not only empowers investors but also helps them make informed decisions as they navigate the often unpredictable crypto landscape. The integration of AI into the meme coin realm is not just innovative; it’s a game-changer. The project also emphasises community engagement, similar to what we see with BTFD Coin and Cat in a Dog’s World. Holders are encouraged to participate in governance, influencing the direction of the project and its features. This democratic approach fosters loyalty and makes users feel like active contributors rather than passive investors. As for investment potential, the early buzz around Act I: The AI Prophecy indicates it could be one of the best new meme coins to buy in December 2024. Its unique selling points and the integration of AI technology position it as a strong contender in the meme coin market. Join the Next Meme Coin Bull Run with BTFD Coin!

The areas with the highest levels of crypto exposure in 2021 also experienced significant increases in both mortgage and auto loan origination and balance figures in the following years. Crypto Gains and Larger Mortgages The report revealed that for low-income households in areas with high crypto exposure, the mortgage rate jumped from 4.1% in January 2020 to 15.4% in January 2024, almost four times higher. The average mortgage balance increased by over 150%, from almost $172K to a little over $443K, indicating that profits from crypto sales may have helped with larger down payments. Low-income households in high-crypto areas earn an average of $40,664, which results in a mortgage debt-to-income ratio of 0.53, well above the recommended 0.36 and the 0.43 required for some standard loans. The report suggests that this high ratio is concerning because it’s linked to a greater risk of default, particularly during financial crises. On the other hand, in low-crypto areas, low-income households have a much lower debt-to-income ratio of 0.19, with an average mortgage balance of $136,481 and income of $35,950. This suggests that the rise in mortgage debt in recent years may be mainly happening in high-crypto areas, which might increase financial instability. From 2020 to 2024, mortgage delinquency rates dropped across the board, particularly among low-income households. The decline in delinquency was similar across areas with high and low crypto exposure. For example, delinquency fell by 4.2% in high-crypto areas and 3.8% in low-crypto areas for low-income groups. High-crypto areas had lower delinquency rates in 2020, so the percentage drop was bigger there. For high-income households, delinquency rates showed little change. As of Q1 2024, delinquency rates are at their lowest in 15 years, around 1.7%, with no signs of “distress” in high-crypto areas. Auto Loan Debt Hits $1.6T, Crypto Areas See Largest Increases Auto loan debt has surged to over $1.6 trillion as of early 2024, with notable increases among low-income households, particularly in high-crypto exposure areas. Between 2020 and 2024, average auto loan balances for low-income households grew by 52% in high-crypto areas compared to a 38% rise in low-crypto areas. This could potentially suggest that crypto earnings or windfalls may have enabled more vehicle purchases. On the other hand, middle- and high-income households saw decreases in their average auto loan balances during the same period, though those in high-crypto areas experienced smaller declines or even slight increases.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 22:05:00

Analyst Thinks It’s Happening This Cycle,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-to-hit-10-analyst-thinks-its-happening-this-cycle/,"As Bitcoin leads the charge for crypto this cycle, with its price teasing the $100k level, many analysts offer predictions on top altcoins. One token that’s widely seen to surge in this cycle is Cardano (ADA), a popular proof-of-stake blockchain that supports dApps. If one crypto analyst is to be believed, Cardano can hit $10 in this current bull cycle. According to Lark Davis, the token’s 213% monthly surge only scratches the surface of its full potential. Cardano has been one of the top-performing digital assets in the last few weeks. With its over 200% gain in one month, Cardano’s market cap is nearing that of USDC. And for Davis, he expects that this “Ethereum killer” will reach an all-time high of $10 this cycle. Can Cardano Surge To $10? If Davis’ predictions hold, Cardano’s price will grow by 800%. The popular crypto commentator suggests that it’s never too late to invest in the asset. Davis’ assertion is based on observations that Cardano still has room for growth. BREAKING: Lark Davis says “ #Cardano ‘s getting the attention and the hype, we could see $10.00 $ADA .” pic.twitter.com/oOpCx0DuI6 — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) November 29, 2024 Davis explains that strong macroeconomic indicators back Cardano, and there’s still hype on its use cases and ecosystem. He mentioned that the attention and favorable market conditions would let the token “run real hard and real fast”. Davis expects Cardano to continue its run in the short term, and its price will hit $3.16. From this price point, the token can increase by 332%, at the back of a 1.618 Fibonacci level, with a price of $4.80. He expects more price action for Cardano, and when the Fibonacci level reaches 2.618, the token’s price can hit $7.70. Finally, Davis sees Caradno making another push to $10 behind a Fibonacci level score of 3.618. Cardano’s Market Dominance According to Davis, Cardano had 4% market dominance in the last cycle. He analyzed that the token’s market cap can increase 10x in the current market valuation, pushing its valuation to roughly $370 billion. This 10-fold increase in market valuation will be reflected in its price, pushing Cardano past the $10 level. In short, the prediction of its Fibonacci price level matches the analyst’s expectations of its market cap. Other market analysts also echo Davis’ price assessment for Cardano. For example. Dan Gambardello shared that the token can hit $5 up to $10 after consolidating above the $1 level. On-Chain Data Suggests A Cardano Surge According to on-chain data, ADA is ready for another price run. Information from CoinMarketCap tells us that the token has already exceeded Binance in terms of 24-hour volume. A surging market volume suggests increased attention and interest in the asset.

Three days ago, Charles Gasparino, a Senior Correspondent at Fox Business, released a tweet highlighting the potential implications of Trump’s re-election for the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs. New US President Equals New SEC Chairman Gasparino cited the Commission’s decision to drop the appeal once a new administration takes over, likely once Trump is in the White House. Noteworthy, the Republican politician promised to oust Gary Gensler, the current agency chairman, on his first day in office. This means the SEC would get a new chairman, a position Robinhood CLO Dan Gallagher recently rejected . In addition, Gasparino quoted former Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Christopher Giancarlo, who also holds the same stance. SEC Has no Case Against Ripple Popular crypto lawyer Bill Morgan responded to Gasparino’s tweet, further emphasizing the possibility of having the SEC drop the appeal. He claimed that the appeal would be dropped because “there was no error made in the part of the case the SEC lost,” not because of political dynamics. In his opinion, the Commission’s move with the appeal is a political motive for continuing a near-hopeless appeal. Unfortunately, Gensler’s potential dethronement, tentatively scheduled for 20 January 2025, will also erase this political motive. This is the date of the official inauguration of the new US president. These comments have sparked significant discussion within the cryptocurrency community, and many crypto enthusiasts are still looking forward to the case’s eventual outcome. Judge Torres Rules in Partial Favor of Ripple For background on the Ripple-SEC case, Federal judge Analisa Torres differentiated between institutional and programmatic sales of XRP in July 2023. She categorized the first group as securities, while programmatic sales to retail investors were termed non-securities. As this verdict marked a partial victory for Ripple , the SEC contested it. In the meantime, trial dates for the unresolved appeals and claims in the Ripple-SEC lawsuit are scheduled for January 2025.

Last around $97,800, Bitcoin bulls remain optimistic that the world’s largest crypto may be about to vault above $100,000.

Why Microsoft can't afford NOT to buy #Bitcoin . Michael Saylor's 3 minute presentation FINALLY Revealed pic.twitter.com/qqQDVYepqa — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) December 1, 2024 Is Altcoin Season Officially On? Whilst all of this is great for Bitcoin, it’s arguably even better for altcoin markets, hence the recent decline in Bitcoin dominance. Altcoin markets were suppressed by a strongly anti-crypto Biden administration and SEC over the past three years. Crypto’s arch-enemy Gary Gensler will step down as SEC chair when Trump is inaugurated in January, and altcoin bulls are hoping this will herald the start of a new golden age for the US crypto industry. Whilst it remains to early to definitively say altcoin season is here – at 57%, Bitcoin dominance has only so far dropped back to its summer 2024 levels and CoinMarketCap’s altcoin index was last at 74 (75 means altcoin season) – a new alt season seems all but inevitable. XRP (XRP) has raced a staggering 322% higher in the past 30 days, adding a staggering more than $80 billion in value to cryptocurrency markets and taking the fourth largest crypto by market cap. Solana (SOL) recently hit new record highs in the $260s, Cardano (ADA) is up over 200% in 30 days, and Ethereum (ETH) is eyeing a retest of $4,000. But chart analysis suggests altcoin season could be about to accelerate, with Bitcoin dominance set to dive. X user Mikybull Crypto pointed out a pattern that Bitcoin dominance tends to remain at elevated levels until roughly 240 days after each halving, only to then dive spectacularly over the course of the next 6 or so months. Wow, Bitcoin dominance has just broken down the 2-year support. We are indeed officially in #ALTSEASON folks! https://t.co/IYfQF7P7XI pic.twitter.com/fVysBYuOKn — Mikybull Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) November 30, 2024 A closer look at the Bitcoin dominance chart also suggests a rising risk that the recent drop could accelerate. Bitcoin dominance has been trending higher within the confines of an upwards trend channel since mid-2023. But that trend channel is under threat of being broken imminently. If this trend line does break, chart analysis suggests a drop back towards a Bitcoin dominance percentage of 50% is likely. How Low Could Bitcoin Dominance Go? Back in January 2018, Bitcoin dominance fell as low as 35% during the first altcoin season before then bottoming out around 39% in 2021 through to late 2022 following the second altcoin season. One might assume then that altcoin season three might send Bitcoin dominance eventually as low as around 40%. Readers should understand, this isn’t to suggest that Bitcoin will do badly, only that altcoins will do better. And there are plenty of narratives to support the case for altcoin outperformance. In recent years, Bitcoin was insulated from SEC attacks and received Blackrock’s support, which culminated in the launch spot ETF launch in January. The same cannot be said for most of the rest of the altcoin market – the last few years has seen the SEC embark on a legal rampage called “regulation by enforcement” against major US crypto firms, which also saw them label dozens of major cryptos as digital securities. Admittedly, Ethereum was able to secure an ETF launch earlier this year, but initial enthusiasm was muted amid the ongoing altcoin market overhang. However, the prospect of a 180-degree shift towards pro-crypto policy has up until recently beaten down coins like XRP and ADA charging higher. All eyes are now on whether Ethereum can follow suit and break above its 2021 record highs about $1000 above current levels. Risks seem strongly tilted in favor of an upside breakout of the largest altcoin by market cap, and a further rapid decline in Bitcoin dominance. Smaller Coin to Consider As Altcoin Season Beacons Major altcoins are set to pump hard in the coming months. But the coins that will perform best are likely to be new, still relatively unknown but massively high-potential projects. There is a lot of chatter about micro-cap coins in the AI space, but traders shouldn’t overlook new meme coins . One name that has been getting a lot of attention in web3 circles in recent weeks has been Pepe Unchained (PEPU) . Pepe Unchained, an innovative meme-themed Ethereum layer-2 protocol that is busily building one of the most promising ecosystems in the crypto space, has raised over $60 million from early backers in its presale. Its huge presale success combined with rapid community growth sets up PEPU to potentially be the most explosive token launch of 2024. cryptonews.com ‘s in-house analyst Crypto Arjay outlines why the project has so much upside potential in the video below.

It is about an approach where every nuance is important: genetics, lifestyle, even the microcosm inside us. All this helps to create a treatment that works specifically for you. I wonder, how such approaches can change your health? Read on to learn about the latest advances in personalized medicine. Nanotechnology in medicine Nanomaterials have become widespread in medicine. This is understandable: the small size of the particles allows them to easily penetrate the skin and tissue. The main task of a person is to learn to control them. After all, uncontrolled nanoparticles in the human body can cause harm, not benefit. Let’s take, for example, particles of mineral dust – why not a nanomaterial? When inhaled, the particles firmly stick to the walls of the bronchi with sharp edges, causing severe lung disease. Scientists have solved this problem, learned how to model nanoparticles of the required size with specified properties. Targeted drug delivery technology using untethered microrobots. Now nanomaterials and nano-devices are widely used in diagnostics and treatment. Their importance is hard to overestimate. Targeted drug delivery technology using untethered microrobots. Source: iopscience.iop.org Targeted drug delivery systems have been created based on nanocapsules. Such capsules are made of a material neutral to the body, in which drugs are placed. The well-known drug ABRAXANE® for cancer treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (USA) was created according to the same principle. Nanocapsules are also used for targeted delivery of drugs for skin diseases and as part of nanogels for the transfer of stem cells. Pinpoint drug delivery reduces the toxic impact on healthy tissues, increases the effectiveness of the drug and accelerates recovery. Nanotechnology has made a real breakthrough in diagnostics. Thanks to nanoparticles, doctors can determine the disease at a lower molecular level, diagnosing the disease at the earliest stage. This is especially important for cancer. Nanoparticles are designed so that they bind to tumor biomarkers and become visible during examination. Thus, the disease is detected at the earliest stage. Nanosensors are successfully used in express tests for the early and rapid diagnosis of diabetes, heart attack and infectious diseases. Holographic technologies RealView Imaging Adopts Intel® RealSense Technology for HOLOSCOPE-i Holographic Augmented Reality Medical System. Therapeutic lasers help treat inflammation and speed up metabolism. But their capabilities do not end there: they are also used to create holographic images of internal organs. Holography is the process of recording and restoring three-dimensional images that are effectively used in minimally invasive surgeries and detailed examination of internal organs. This technology allows you to create and visualize volumetric holograms in space. One of the developers of such methods is RealView Imaging, an Israeli startup that develops applications for medical imaging. The system allows you to create online interactive three-dimensional images based on angiography and ultrasound data. RealView Imaging technology receives ultrasound, CT or MRI data and reconstructs this data in three-dimensional space, creating a hologram that a specialist can work with. Holographic technologies are successfully used in volumetric surgery . They reduce the rehabilitation period after interventions, improve the quality of treatment and the effectiveness of procedures. Virtual reality Due to the effect of full immersion, metaverses create the feeling that everything is happening in reality – this is exactly what is needed for medicine. Source: ourmetaversetimes.com The emergence of #metaverses can take medical practice to a new level. Telemedicine is one of the most promising areas for the use of virtual reality technologies, where extended consultations can be carried out. Metaverses are able to create the impression of reality due to the effect of deep immersion, which makes them ideal for such purposes. Doctors and patients can meet in a virtual office, using digital doubles for diagnosis and treatment at a distance. Metaverse Virtual Space (MVS) by Lado Okhotnikov for medicine and healthy lifestyle Lado Okhotnikov, CEO of Holiversе, the creator of the #Metaverse Virtual Space (MVS) metaverse did not stop at creating virtual reality. The company develops unique DNA-based avatars — digital models created by analyzing the human genome. The process begins with obtaining a sample of the user’s genetic material. This is usually done by swabbing the inside of the cheek. The sample is then sent to a lab for analysis. The lab sequences the entire genome. The genome consists of 3.5 billion base pairs, which represent the code for #DNA. This data is analyzed using artificial intelligence algorithms to compare the user’s unique genetic profile with databases of how the human body works at a molecular level. This reveals individual characteristics of the user, including their metabolism, potential susceptibility to various diseases, and even aging patterns. This information is used in conjunction with photos provided by the user to create a personalized digital avatar. A digital avatar is a mathematical model with many variables that predict how the body will respond to various life conditions, including diet, exercise, supplements, and medical interventions. The avatar will also be able to display changes in the user’s appearance over time, taking into account the impact of lifestyle on aging and health. Lado Okhotnikov continues to explore the possibilities of the virtual world in interaction with reality. He believes that investments in this area will benefit humanity: the technology for creating digital avatars will help avoid fatal errors during clinical drug trials and surgical interventions. According to him, these avatars are designed, among other things, to help the user better understand their body and make the right decision about treatment. Fundamental Surgery by FundamentalVR for surgical modeling and training An example of a successful combination of virtual and real is the Fundamental Surgery platform from the British company FundamentalVR, which specializes in VR technologies. The platform allows you to perform various operations in a safe environment, using haptic system and interactive elements. This helps surgeons improve their skills and prepare for real operating conditions without risk to patients. The company provides training and support to doctors in more than 30 countries. Fundamental Surgery allows doctors from all over the world to meet, consult patients, teach and learn new medical technologies. Brain — computer interface Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology developed at the beginning of the 21st century, which has received a new impetus for development along with #VR, #AI and other computer technologies. BCI allows you to control electronic devices with your thoughts. This field of science explores the possibilities of direct communication between the human brain and external devices, such as computers, robots and medical equipment. The development of this technology will open up new opportunities in medicine, entertainment and everyday life, providing people with alternative ways of interacting with the world around them. This tool is especially promising for people with disabilities. With the help of thought, people will be able to control objects, devices and communicate with other people. Health and longevity are one of the main priorities of our society. We have considered only a small part of the technologies that will help a person to prevent and treat diseases. But we must not forget that technologies are just tools in the hands of a person and they must be treated wisely and responsibly.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 23:28:00

The Democratic Party (DP), the largest party in the National Assembly, had threatened to thwart the ruling People’s Power Party (PPP)’s plans to postpone the launch. But the DP’s late bid to amend existing law in favor of its own proposal to instead raise the annual tax threshold for crypto traders has failed. Crypto Tax Launch Delayed Yet Again Money Today reported that Park Chan-dae, the DP’s floor leader, said the party had agreed to the government’s plan. Park was speaking at a press conference at the National Assembly on December 1. DP Floor Leader Park Chan-dae, speaking about crypto tax launch plans at a press conference at the South Korean National Assembly on December 1. (Source: MBC News/YouTube/Screenshot) Park said the decision had been made “after in-depth discussions on the postponement of taxation on virtual assets.” He agreed that “more institutional preparation” was “needed” before tax bodies started trying to tax crypto traders. This appears to echo the sentiments recently voiced by the DP leader Lee Jae-myung. Lee argued that crypto tax was not yet “systematically possible.” “We will process the government’s income tax law amendment bill to defer taxation on virtual assets at the National Assembly plenary session on December 2.” Park Chan-dae, lawmaker and DP Floor Leader It appears that the DP is making the concession so it can focus its attention on bills on the separate taxation of dividend income and the easing of inheritance tax, both of which it opposes. A South Korean crypto trader surnamed Kim told Cryptonews.com on December 1: “This whole situation about crypto tax is a complete mess. And politicians are squarely to blame for all of this. As a crypto investor, of course, I am happy not to pay tax. But this situation has been badly mishandled by the government, the opposition, and everyone else.” People Power Party Rep. Na Kyung-won proposed introducing a policy similar to France’s ""Pacte Civil de Solidarite"" to offer legal protection for children born to unmarried parents. https://t.co/i889BwHZe1 — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 1, 2024 Third Delay Lawmakers first voted in favor of launching crypto tax in December 2020. The levy was first scheduled for launch on January 1, 2021. However, its debut has since been postponed twice , on both occasions with just weeks to go before launch. Korea's exports grow for 14th month in Nov. on record shipments of chips https://t.co/9iqTzZH7h2 — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) December 1, 2024 DP lawmakers last week tried to convince the government to accept a rival bill . This bill proposed launching crypto tax per the existing schedule (January 2025). But the bill also proposed raising the annual threshold to 50 million won (around $36,000). This would have given crypto investors parity with stock market trading. The party reportedly claimed: “Most investors, except for a very small number of large-scale traders, will not end up being subject to taxation [under our proposal].” However, the PPP appears to have rebuffed the DP’s various attempts to force its bill through National Assembly subcommittees last week.

With so many options on the market, it’s not always easy to figure out which projects deserve your attention. Fortunately, some cryptos have already proven their value over time. Bitcoin, as the original cryptocurrency, continues to reign supreme, holding its status as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.Similarly, Stellar has emerged as a powerhouse in the world of cross-border payments. However, if you’re looking to step into something with massive potential and ground-breaking technology, then Qubetics might be exactly what you’re looking for. Qubetics is currently in the presale phase, selling $TICS tokens at a low price of $0.025, with analysts predicting that the token price could reach $10-$15 after the mainnet launch. With over 251 million tokens sold to more than 5000 holders, it’s clear that the momentum around Qubetics is building, and the presale stage is quickly becoming a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for those who want to invest early before the price skyrockets. Qubetics: Innovation at the Forefront with the QubeQode IDE When it comes to blockchain innovation, Qubetics is taking things to the next level. One of the standout features of the project is its QubeQode IDE, a tool designed to simplify the process of developing and deploying smart contracts. For anyone who’s ever tried to create a smart contract or build a blockchain application, you know how complicated and technical the process can be. That’s where Qubetics comes in, offering an intuitive, easy-to-use platform that eliminates the complexity. Developers no longer need to be experts in blockchain code to get started with building decentralized applications—QubeQode IDE takes care of much of the heavy lifting. This can radically expand the number of people who can participate in the blockchain revolution, from solo developers to large-scale enterprise teams. But the real magic happens when you think about the real-world applications of Qubetics. Imagine businesses that need to handle secure, automated transactions but are put off by the steep learning curve of blockchain development. With QubeQode, these businesses can quickly deploy smart contracts and integrate blockchain technology into their operations. In fact, Qubetics could solve major pain points for industries such as finance, supply chain, and healthcare. Additionally, Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet ensures that users maintain control over their own funds without the risk of third-party hacks or restrictions. As the market for decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to grow, Qubetics is well-positioned to become a major player in the space, offering tools that can simplify and secure the blockchain experience for everyone. Qubetics’ Presale: A Window of Opportunity for Early Investors If you’re wondering when to jump in on Qubetics, the presale stage is currently in full swing, and it’s one of the best crypto to invest in right now . As of now, Qubetics has raised over $3.9 million and sold more than 251 million tokens. The presale price is currently at $0.025 per token, which is incredibly affordable compared to the price forecasted after the mainnet launch. With analysts predicting that the price could surge to anywhere between $10-$15 per token after the mainnet goes live, the presale represents a unique chance to get in early on a project with huge growth potential. To date, more than 5300 holders have already invested in the presale, indicating strong confidence in the project and its future success. Investing in a presale offers a rare opportunity to acquire tokens at a discounted rate before the general public gets access. But it’s not just about the potential for high returns—it’s also about timing. As Qubetics continues to build out its infrastructure and gain traction, the value of $TICS tokens is only expected to rise. With the QubeQode IDE set to launch and the mainnet coming soon, this is the perfect time to consider getting involved in Qubetics. Whether you’re an experienced crypto investor or new to the scene, Qubetics’ presale represents a once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of a project that’s poised to reshape the blockchain landscape. Bitcoin: The King of Cryptos No discussion of the best crypto to invest in would be complete without mentioning Bitcoin. As the first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains a cornerstone of the crypto market. It is the digital gold of the space, widely seen as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Despite the volatility in the markets, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook continues to be strong. Over the past decade, Bitcoin has consistently proven to be a reliable investment, weathering downturns and emerging stronger each time. It is the benchmark cryptocurrency, and for many, Bitcoin remains the ultimate choice for anyone looking for stability in the unpredictable world of digital assets. Stellar: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments In the world of cross-border payments, Stellar is making a name for itself. The Stellar network is designed to allow quick and low-cost transfers of value across borders, which is a critical problem in today’s global economy. Whether it’s remittances, international trade, or micropayments, Stellar’s fast and cost-effective solution has garnered attention from financial institutions worldwide. With partnerships with large organizations like IBM, Stellar is cementing its place as one of the most important players in the crypto space. Its ability to streamline cross-border payments in ways traditional systems can’t make it a top contender for the best crypto to invest in. As the world continues to move toward a more digital, decentralized economy, Stellar’s potential to disrupt the financial system is only growing. Conclusion If you’re searching for the best crypto to invest in for 2024, it’s clear that both Bitcoin and Stellar offer stability and proven value. However, for those looking for the next big thing, Qubetics presents an exciting opportunity. With its QubeQode IDE, presale excitement, and strong analyst predictions, Qubetics is setting itself up to disrupt the blockchain industry and offer incredible returns for early investors.

Van Code has an interesting take on the transaction, attributing this activity to institutional investors. A very larger order of 2.1M #XRP just executed on #Binance . These are not whales. They are institutions buying. pic.twitter.com/hdR7x0Dl5P — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 1, 2024 This sentiment comes as XRP reaches a major milestone, recently crossing the $2 price point for the first time since 2018. The price movement reflects heightened interest in XRP, particularly as institutional players begin to recognize its potential as both an investment and a tool for blockchain-based financial services. When asked by a community member why the institutions waited this long to invest in XRP, Van Code remarked that institutions are now stepping in due to increased regulatory clarity, stating they feel safe from potential actions by Gary Gensler and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Shifting Regulatory Landscape XRP has been smashing through milestones since Donald Trump won the U.S. Presidential election. This rally intensified when Gensler, the SEC’s current Chair, hinted at a resignation. Gensler has led an anti-crypto war in the U.S. for years, and this caused institutions to stay away from cryptocurrencies like XRP and slowed the advancement of the U.S. crypto space. However, Trump supports the crypto market and has promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. Gensler has revealed that he will step down from his role on January 20, and anticipation of the Trump administration’s pro-crypto policies and potential crypto-friendly SEC Chair is already sending the market to new heights. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Rise Among Institutional Investors Institutions are returning to XRP, as multiple asset managers have recently filed applications to launch ETFs for XRP, and the WisdomTree XRP ETP recently debuted in Europe. These developments show a growing appetite for XRP among institutional investors, who view it as a versatile asset with long-term potential. The institutional interest is expected to intensify as the old administration transitions out of office. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has also been key in driving adoption through its blockchain-powered solutions. By partnering with financial institutions globally, Ripple is positioning XRP as a practical tool for efficient and cost-effective cross-border payments. This dual utility as a trading asset and a payment solution has made XRP increasingly attractive to institutional players, and this transaction might just be the first of many as XRP rises.

This puts Pump.fun’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) at $1.5 billion. Token Launch and New Trading Features The stake can be purchased on SecondLane’s web app and through its Telegram channel, where new offerings are regularly announced. Pump.fun, which has yet to launch a native token, is a Solana-based platform built around the meme coin trading frenzy. It has attracted a significant user base and boasts considerable transaction volume. According to DefiLlama data , Pump.fun is currently the eighth highest-earning blockchain protocol, just below key players such as Circle and Uniswap. Over the past 30 days, it has generated $86 million in fees, and its cumulative fee revenue exceeds $225 million. PitchBook shows that it has also raised funds from notable investors, including Alliance DAO, Big Brain Holdings, and 6th Man Ventures. In October 2024, the Pump.fun team hinted at a future token launch, although they did not provide a specific timeline for the event. They also shared plans for an upgraded trading terminal called “Pump Advance,” which is expected to introduce mini-charts, data on top holders, and social indicators to help traders navigate the increasingly crowded meme coin market. Incentives Amidst High Token Failure Rate Despite its popularity, Pump.fun is facing quite a few challenges. Data from Dune Analytics shows that about 98% of meme coins listed on the platform have failed. To address this, the team behind the project introduced an $80 incentive in August 2024 to encourage token creators to complete the bonding curve and successfully list their tokens on Raydium. The platform has also slashed its token launch fee from $2 to zero. The platform was also recently forced to press pause on its livestream feature following increased cases of inappropriate content. Some users had resorted to streaming acts of self-harm, threats of self-harm, or other disturbing or violent acts to pump their tokens. Meme coins, which are Pump.fun’s bread and butter have also caused mixed reactions within the crypto community. Prominent figures like former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) have criticized the growing number of these assets, suggesting that developers should focus on creating more useful blockchain applications. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also called for crypto builders to stop copying and pasting meme coins and instead make them into more exciting blockchain games.

Global trade has been a recurring bison for the crypto market but has performed poorly over the years due to regulatory and industry-related factors. The report, “From Digital Currency to Legal Tender: The Role of Regulated Stablecoins in Driving Real-World Payments,” drafted by Quinlan & Associates and IDA, shows limitations in present stablecoin utility, a possible pathway to asset adoption, and regulations. Per the release, stablecoins can transform cross-border payments and domestic trade through speed and security. Another major factor for stablecoin adoption is the ability to process transactions within 24 hours and make it more efficient. Several countries have also tried to make their stablecoin replica in the form of Central Bank Digital Currencies ( CBDCs ) backed with local assets. “ In the case of domestic payments, users can leverage programmable features to set self-executed scheduled top-ups, conditioned payments, and instant settlements. For cross-border payments, stablecoins can support faster, cheaper, and more transparent user experiences. In these two realms, stablecoins will play a critical role in supporting Hong Kong’s ambition to become a leading global Web3 hub.” Non-USD Stablecoin Can Raise Adoption At the moment, stablecoins account for 0.02% of global trades, a low figure compared to the level projected by maker participants. Two major reasons for this are regulation and the absence of non-USD stablecoins. According to the report, 83% of countries globally are not using USD as their main or substitute currency. Although USD remains the most popular asset, about 40% of global trade is in non-USD currencies creating a need for similar stablecoins. The absence of this creates scarcity in the market that could easily be filled boosting the total industry’s numbers. Lack of Regulation Stalls Adoption The stablecoin market cap stands at $200 billion, with USD-based assets making up the majority. Another factor responsible for the slow adoption is regulation. At the moment, some countries have yet to pass comprehensive crypto laws, creating a vacuum. This leads to regulatory uncertainty, plunging investor sentiments as they avoid such markets. The report states that 81% of global merchants cite the lack of proper regulations as a major barrier to the adoption of stablecoins. Adding to the complexities are frequent lawsuits filed by regulators due to an absence of rules. A notable example is the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approach in the last two years.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-01 23:53:04

This comes on the heels of the Binance listing , which sent the asset on an uphill climb. Thena claims to be an innovative decentralized liquidity layer deployed on the BNB network and has garnered steam this week. The trader used 698 BNB worth approximately $429K to purchase 416,897 $THE. As a result of the price rally, the asset soared in value to over $1 million, making the trader net a whopping $596K. This 196% growth in a short period sparked positive conversations within the community on the state of bull cycles. Crypto users pointed to the importance of alerts for centralized exchange listings to stay ahead of others in the market. Recently, the industry has recorded several token moves, resulting in high profits. Meme coins make up most of these assets due to their high volatility and community traction upon launch. Binance Listing Sends $THE To Impressive Heights Binance listings were at the center of the surge, and profits were made by several traders. Within 24 hours, the asset surged to a $233 million market cap as bulls set gaze for gains. The exchange also announced airdrops for users interacting with the Simple Earn product. Analysts posit that the listings will enable the asset to reach its potential, achieving a wider adoption with a better shot at strategic partnerships. X user @cryptokaduna wrote: “ Yesterday CZ tweeted: “I am not against memes, but meme coins are getting “a little” weird now. Let’s build real applications using blockchain. Then Binance listed $THE (a project on BSC). Will they continue to list more real applications on BSC? It seems like people are betting on $NMT.” Crypto Bulls Maintain Pressure Despite the price correction recorded earlier this week, a bullish presence in the market has taken the prices of assets upwards. This trajectory has seen Bitcoin price hit $96,470, a 5% rise in the last 24 hours. Similarly, altcoins such as Ethereum and Solana gained 9% and 4.4% respectively with ETF flows notching high spikes.

Table of Contents Dogecoin eyes $1 after golden cross formation IntelMarkets eyes $1, following 500% price pump Ethereum breaks out of H&S pattern Final Thoughts The crypto market has been on an uptrend, but crypto experts expect that the coin’s many top altcoins to pick up more pace over the next few weeks. Ethereum (ETH) is aiming for $5,800 after breaking out of a head and shoulders pattern. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) and a new AI coin called IntelMarkets (INTL) could see huge gains in the coming months. IntelMarkets is just in the sixth stage of its presale and has raised over $2.6 million. Dogecoin eyes $1 after golden cross formation Krisspax a leading expert, has noted that Dogecoin is displaying very bullish signals. According to him, the Dogecoin crypto has formed a new Golden Cross in the MACD averages below the zero level. This technical pattern is a bullish signal, which means the memecoin could surge to new levels in the coming weeks. With this positive charting formation, Krisspax believes the Dogecoin token could see an upward movement to $1. Such a potential surge makes DOGE one of the best meme coins to watch. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s price is attempting to climb above the $0.5 mark. CoinMarketCap data reveals it has gains of 10.5% and 139.0% on the biweekly and monthly levels. The cryptocurrency has a long way to go before it can cross $1.

Because IntelMarkets is set to transform the crypto trading space, experts expect INTL to reach $1 in the months ahead. One of the main features of IntelMarkets is the use of artificial intelligence in trading bots. These bots are created to help traders make automated trades. The bots can analyze market conditions and make changes to trading strategies in real-time. So, IntelMarkets’ AI bots are far more precise than any manual trader. This automation enables traders to take advantage of the opportunities at any one time without having to sit in front of the computer all the time. Besides the AI trading bots, IntelMarkets also has a reasonable fee structure that is important to traders in order to minimize their trading costs. It also has a no-KYC policy, which means that the identity of the users is not revealed when they are trading. This removes the stressful process of identity verification, thus allowing users to get started easily. IntelMarkets has also had its smart contracts audited by Cyberscope in order to ensure that its smart contracts are safe from hacks. This audit helps to build trust in the platform and gives traders confidence in the fairness of their transactions. Ethereum breaks out of H&S pattern Trader Tardigrade told his followers in a recent tweet that Ethereum has broken out of an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern. He said a retest to the $3,538-$3,445 range may be the last signal to enter these lower levels before the Ethereum coin skyrockets. With this breakout in place, the altcoin price is likely to explode to a new all-time high. Trader Tardigrade forecasts a target of $5,800 for the altcoin in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the sentiment around the Ethereum ETFs has improved. Over $200 million has flown into the ETF in the past week. Also, the VWMA (10) and Hull Moving Average (9) are flashing buy signals that support an uptrend. At the moment, the Ethereum price is trading above the $3,500 mark. There are profits of 6.0% on the weekly chart and 34.0% on the monthly level, according to CoinMarketCap.

Market Strategist Says WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Go From $0.017 To $11 First,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-price-to-hit-5-market-strategist-says-wallitiq-wltq/,"Speculations about the Dogecoin price in the crypto market are heating up, and recent forecasts from market strategists are suggesting that the Dogecoin price might reach the $5 mark. However, the attention of most investors is not on the Dogecoin price but on WallitIQ (WLTQ), as the same market strategist predicts that the newcomer, WLTQ, will rise from $0.017 to $11 before the Dogecoin price gets to $5. Unlock Unmatched Investment Potential With WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale WallitIQ (WLTQ) has positioned itself as a top contender in the crypto market with its impressive ongoing presale by presenting a decentralized crypto wallet that allows investors and traders to have total control over their portfolios and digital assets. By adopting AI solutions and machine learning algorithms, WallitIQ (WLTQ) promotes financial security, decentralization, and security for its users. Following the market strategist’s predictions of WallitIQ (WLTQ) to rise from its current presale price of $0.017 to $11, most investors are in doubt that the Dogecoin price will get to $5 in the near future. As a result, many of these investors are rapidly buying the WallitIQ native token, WLTQ in order to position themselves for massive future gains. Early investors in the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale will enjoy benefits such as referral bonuses, participation in governance decisions, early profits due to token price increases in the next presale stage, and much more. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) will provide its users access to blockchain-based activities like trading, yield farming, and staking activities. There are also incentives such as a 180% annual percentage yield (APY) when holders stake their tokens. Another outstanding feature that supports the market strategist‘s 64,665% gain prediction for WallitIQ (WLTQ) is its fast-rising acceptance among merchants and traders who aim to adopt its crypto wallet. The WallitIQ wallet provides top features such as a Scan and Pay QR functionality that eliminates errors and saves time during transactions and DeFi payments. WallitIQ (WLTQ) also combines advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to guarantee the investors’ private keys and transactions are protected from fraudulent interceptions, making WallitIQ (WLTQ) a highly secure yet user-friendly decentralized wallet. With the first presale stage still ongoing, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has continued to attract both retail and institutional investors looking to benefit from the market strategist’s projected price increase. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has bolstered the confidence of its users after undergoing a thorough smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof , a prominent cybersecurity and blockchain audit firm specializing in protecting blockchain projects and financial institutions from malicious attacks. Will Dogecoin Price Hit $5? The recent surge in the Dogecoin price has stirred a new debate among market strategists and investors on whether the Dogecoin will hit the $5 mark. Based on new Bitcoin ATHs and political developments, Dogecoin price volatility continues to maintain its relevance in the crypto market. Following Donald Trump’s victory in the just concluded U.S. presidential elections and his appointment of Elon Musk to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the interest in the Dogecoin price has increased among crypto enthusiasts. In the past, the Tesla CEO’s tweets have often influenced the Dogecoin price. The announcement of Musk’s involvement in this crypto-supportive government has further heightened investor interest in the meme coin. According to data from CoinGecko, Dogecoin’s market cap is at $56.7 billion with a daily trading volume of $12.4 billion. As of the time of this writing, the Dogecoin price is at $0.3861. Join The WallitIQ Presale For Massive Gains The impressive numbers in the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale mirror its growth potential and underscore the tremendous opportunity available for early investors. Following the market strategist predictions of WallitIQ (WLTQ) reaching $11 before tge Dogecoin price gets to its ambitious target of $5, smart investors are buying WLTQ tokens for a low price of $0.0171 in order to position themselves for unparalleled returns.

The Altcoin Season Index has reached 74/100, signaling a robust shift into alt dominance, while the Fear & Greed Index sits at an “Extreme Greed” level of 81—caution is advised, but the excitement is palpable. Source: coinmarketcap.com This week, we conclude our three-part series on the AI crypto sector. After exploring Fetch.ai ($FET ) and Render Network ($RNDR )—two giants with established reputations—it’s time to shed light on a true underdog: Opulous ($OPUL ). Ranked 824th with a market cap of just under $55M, OPUL is a fraction of FET ($4.7B) and RNDR ($4.69B), making it a potential dark horse in the AI coin race. Small in size but mighty in potential, OPUL represents a rare high-risk, high-reward play. Let’s dissect its fundamentals and technicals to see why it could outpace its larger peers. Opulous: Fundamentals at a Glance At its core, Opulous is revolutionizing music financing and rights management with blockchain technology. By tokenizing music royalties, the platform allows artists and fans to interact in an entirely new way. Its standout features include: Market Cap: $55M, ranked 824th. A minuscule valuation compared to Render’s $4.69B, highlighting the upside potential. Circulating Supply: Fully diluted at 500M tokens (no inflation risk; all tokens are already in circulation). CEX Listing Potential: Currently trading on niche platforms like MEXC and Gate.io. A listing on larger exchanges like Binance or Coinbase could transform its supply-demand dynamics, especially since liquidity is relatively scarce. In essence, Opulous combines blockchain utility with a niche, high-growth industry (music royalties). This unique narrative makes it stand out, especially as AI and decentralization converge across sectors. Technical Analysis: Resistance, Breakouts, and the Bigger Picture 1W Chart: The Battle at 12 Cents Price action this week underscores the importance of the $0.12 level—a confluence of horizontal resistance (where previous rallies have failed) and dynamic resistance (the 50-week and 100-week SMAs). A breakout above this zone would signal a major trend shift, but until then, caution is warranted. Let’s break this down:​ Dynamic Resistance: The 50-week SMA (simple moving average) curves upward just below $0.12. Think of it as a long-term moving trendline that acts as a ceiling until broken. (In simple terms: the 50 SMA tracks average prices over 50 weeks, smoothing out short-term noise.) Horizontal Resistance: Historical price action shows that $0.12 aligns with multiple rejection zones, making it a psychological and technical barrier. Why It Matters: Breaking above this confluence could lead to a rapid climb to $0.17 (next resistance) and beyond, as historical supply zones diminish. 1D Chart: Preparing for Lift-Off On the daily chart, OPUL has reclaimed the 200-day SMA ($0.09) for the first time in over a year—a textbook bullish signal. Volume, while still subdued, shows signs of rising, and the chart suggests a potential Golden Cross (when the 50D SMA crosses above the 200D SMA—a classic bullish formation). Key observations: Rejection Zone at $0.39: This level, the upper border of a 2.5-year accumulation range, rejected March’s rally, marking it as a critical take-profit target for long-term bulls. Golden Cross Alert: Expected in December if momentum holds. Strategies: Entering the Dark Horse Breakout Above $0.12 Why: A confirmed daily or weekly close above $0.12 validates the bullish trend, opening the door to $0.17 and beyond. Stop Loss: $0.11 (tight for breakout traders). Take Profit: $0.17 (initial resistance), $0.39 (long-term resistance). $0.09-$0.07 Accumulation Zone Why: Confluence of dynamic support (200 SMA on daily) and historical horizontal support. Stop Loss: $0.065 (below the 2.5-year accumulation range). Take Profit: $0.12-$0.17. Absolute Bottoms: $0.05 Zone Why: Final support level based on multiple retests during the bear market. Ideal for stink orders. Stop Loss: below $0.04. Take Profit: $0.09, $0.17, $0.39. Long-Term Targets: Moonshots and Reality Realistic Goals (2024): $0.17 (early 2023 resistance). $0.39 (March’s rejection zone). $1.00-$1.25 (historical key levels). Ultra-Optimistic Goals (2025): $3.50 (5x market cap). $7.67 (ATH from 2021 bull run). Risk vs. Reward: A breakout above $0.12 significantly reduces downside risk, but the low liquidity and small market cap could amplify volatility. Stick to a strategy and avoid emotional decisions. Summary: A Hidden Gem with Tremendous Potential Opulous represents the kind of opportunity that comes along rarely: a niche project with strong fundamentals, undervalued in market cap, and ripe for a breakout. However, patience is key. The $0.12 resistance zone remains a pivotal battleground, and a breakout will likely define the next leg of its journey. For now, keep an eye on volume, monitor the charts, and always respect stop-loss levels. As the final installment of our AI trilogy, Opulous stands out not just as a coin but as a story waiting to unfold. Small in size, colossal in potential—this dark horse could lead the race if the market aligns. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

From explosive presale performances to quirky tokens making headlines, meme coins are proving to be a gateway for crypto enthusiasts looking for quick wins. If you’re scouting for the best new meme coins to buy and hold for short-term gains, you’ve hit the jackpot. Today, we’ll be diving into three rising stars in the meme coin universe: BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Snek. First up, let’s talk about BTFD Coin , the current darling of the crypto community. This coin has been making waves with its presale performance, crossing impressive milestones at lightning speed. With over $400,000 raised and 10 billion coins sold so far, BTFD Coin has captured the hearts (and wallets) of investors globally. But hold on—Notcoin and Snek are no slouches either. Both of these tokens bring unique vibes to the table, offering exciting opportunities for those seeking fast returns. So, grab your popcorn and let’s break down why these three coins are the best new meme coins to buy and hold for short-term gains. BTFD Coin: Short-Term Gains with Long-Term Potential Let’s kick off with BTFD Coin, a meme coin that’s redefining how investors approach crypto dips. Short for Buy The Dip, BTFD Coin is all about encouraging investors to turn market downturns into profit opportunities. Its community-driven ethos, combined with a highly anticipated P2E game and staking rewards, makes it a powerhouse for short-term gains. As of its current presale stage (Stage 5), BTFD Coin is priced at $0.00005, with over $400,000 raised and 10 billion coins already snapped up by eager investors. This kind of performance screams potential. The presale has been smashing records, and analysts are buzzing about its likely price jump once it hits exchanges. Projections suggest it could debut at $0.0006—a significant leap from its presale price. Here’s the exciting part: if you invest $1,000 in the presale at $0.00005, you’d bag 20 million BTFD Coins. When the price rises to $0.0006, your investment would be worth a jaw-dropping $12,000. That’s the kind of short-term gain that makes meme coins irresistible. But BTFD Coin isn’t just about quick profits. Its ecosystem, complete with staking options offering an average APY of 90%, promises ongoing rewards for holders.

Its ability to balance short-term gains with user engagement is what makes it a top contender in the meme coin space. Snek: Slithering Its Way to Short-Term Success Last but certainly not least, we have Snek, a meme coin that’s equal parts charm and ambition. Inspired by the classic snake game, Snek is bringing retro vibes to the modern crypto scene. Its gamified ecosystem has captured the attention of gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike, making it a hot pick for short-term profits.

Most likely, it’s Ethereum. It’s the leader in smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), and it’s constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the blockchain space. But that’s not all. VeChain, a blockchain project focused on supply chain management, is quickly growing in prominence, solving real-world problems and building trust with enterprises globally. Both Ethereum and VeChain have made huge strides in the crypto world and continue to be some of the best crypto to invest in due to their established use cases and long-term potential. But wait—what if we told you that Qubetics is emerging as a major player, too? With its unique approach to blockchain technology, Qubetics is catching the eyes of investors. The project has just raised $3.9 million in its presale, and with over 5300 holders, it’s gaining serious momentum. Analysts are predicting that Qubetics could hit a price range of $10-15 after the mainnet launch, making it one of the best crypto to invest in for the future. Its QubeQode IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is set to revolutionize how developers interact with blockchain, giving them a platform to build and deploy decentralized applications seamlessly. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Blockchain with QubeQode IDE Qubetics isn’t your typical crypto project. While many focus solely on tokenomics or decentralized finance (DeFi), Qubetics is tackling the developer experience head-on. Its QubeQode IDE is a game-changer for the crypto world. Developers will have access to an all-in-one environment to build, test, and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) without the usual complexity. This makes it easier for both new and experienced developers to jump into the blockchain ecosystem. With Qubetics providing an intuitive platform, blockchain development becomes less intimidating, enabling more innovation in the space. What’s even more exciting? Qubetics’ presale numbers are through the roof. They’ve raised $3.9 million so far, with over 5300 holders and 251 million tokens sold in Phase 10. And at just $0.025 per token, there’s still an opportunity to get in early before Qubetics hits the big time. Analysts are predicting that once the mainnet launches, the price could soar to anywhere between $10-15 per token. With such a promising future and a unique offering in QubeQode, Qubetics is definitely one of the best crypto to invest in today. Ethereum: Still Leading the Charge When it comes to smart contracts, Ethereum is still the king. Its massive network and developer base make it the go-to platform for decentralized applications (dApps). The Ethereum ecosystem is vast and includes everything from DeFi to NFTs. And with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, Ethereum is transitioning to a more sustainable proof-of-stake model, which only increases its long-term viability. The network’s dominance in the blockchain space makes it one of the best crypto to invest in today, and it’s not showing signs of slowing down anytime soon. Ethereum’s strong presence in the DeFi space, its network of decentralized applications, and its partnerships with major companies all contribute to its continued success. If you’re looking for a safe bet in the world of crypto, Ethereum should definitely be on your radar. While there are other blockchains trying to compete, Ethereum’s ecosystem is tough to beat. For those seeking solid growth, Ethereum remains a leader in the market. VeChain: Supply Chain Management on Blockchain VeChain’s focus is on improving supply chain management through blockchain technology. By providing solutions for tracking products and ensuring transparency, VeChain is helping companies improve efficiency and reduce fraud. With a strong real-world use case, VeChain has partnered with major companies and governments worldwide to improve the traceability of goods and services. This makes VeChain a standout project in the blockchain space and one of the best crypto to invest in if you’re looking for something with tangible use in the supply chain sector. VeChain’s business model is based on providing blockchain solutions to industries, particularly in the supply chain. The network offers a platform for secure data sharing and tracking, which enhances transparency and reduces errors in the supply chain. As more industries look for ways to streamline their operations and reduce fraud, VeChain’s technology could become even more essential. For investors who are interested in a blockchain project with practical applications, VeChain is certainly worth considering. Conclusion While Ethereum and VeChain continue to make strides in their respective spaces, Qubetics offers something different—and perhaps even more exciting for future growth. The combination of a presale that’s already raised $3.5 million, a rapidly growing community, and analysts predicting a price surge to $10-15 after the mainnet launch, makes Qubetics one of the best crypto to invest in for 2024 and beyond. Its QubeQode IDE and tokenized marketplace are set to make a real impact on the blockchain world, attracting developers and businesses alike. With a promising future and innovative solutions for blockchain development, Qubetics is not just another project—it’s a movement. If you’re looking to diversify your crypto portfolio, Qubetics could be the perfect addition. With its impressive presale success and unique approach, it might just be the best crypto to invest in right now. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to get in early!

Want to know where the real opportunities are hiding in 2024? Well, look no further because Qubetics, Cronos, and Hedera are currently paving the way for some of the most promising investments in the market. Whether it’s Qubetics’ groundbreaking non-custodial wallet, Cronos’ ecosystem expansion, or Hedera’s role in scaling decentralized finance, these three cryptos have the potential to change the game. So, let’s dive into why they should be on your radar right now and why Qubetics is gearing up for an explosive post-mainnet launch. Qubetics: The Future of Crypto Wallets When we talk about the best cryptos to buy now, we can’t ignore Qubetics, especially with its innovative approach to blockchain technology. Qubetics is redefining the way we interact with digital assets, and it all begins with its non-custodial wallet. Now, you might be wondering, “What makes a non-custodial wallet so important?” Well, for starters, it gives users full control over their funds. No longer do you need to worry about relying on a third-party service to store your crypto. In a world where security risks are higher than ever, Qubetics offers a solution that puts privacy and control back into the hands of the users. The Qubetics wallet stands out because it’s designed to be user-friendly, even for those new to the crypto world. Unlike traditional wallets that can be complicated and require technical expertise, Qubetics offers an intuitive experience that allows anyone — from beginners to experts — to manage their digital assets securely. Whether you’re storing tokens, interacting with smart contracts, or participating in DeFi applications, the wallet makes it easy to do it all with a few clicks. This simple but powerful tool is likely to be a game-changer in how we approach blockchain and digital finance. But that’s just the beginning for Qubetics. The project is currently in its presale phase, raising an impressive $3.9 million and selling over 251 million tokens. Priced at just $0.025 per token during presale, analysts predict that the value of $TICS could soar to anywhere between $10 and $15 after its mainnet launch. That means if you get in now, you could be looking at incredible ROI once Qubetics hits the mainstream. With its innovative wallet and upcoming developments, Qubetics is poised for explosive growth, and now could be the perfect time to add this gem to your portfolio. Cronos: A Bridge Between Traditional Finance and DeFi Next up, let’s talk about Cronos, a blockchain that’s been making serious strides in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Cronos is a smart contract platform that focuses on creating an ecosystem that connects traditional finance with blockchain technology. What makes Cronos stand out is its unique positioning within the crypto space: it’s part of the Crypto.com family, which provides it with an established user base and access to millions of users worldwide. With its focus on scalability, interoperability, and security, Cronos is fast becoming a top choice for developers looking to build decentralized applications (dApps). One of Cronos’ most attractive features is its ability to offer fast transactions and low fees. In a space where transaction speed and costs can make or break a project, Cronos delivers on both fronts. This makes it an appealing choice for anyone looking to build on Ethereum but without the high gas fees that often come with it. Plus, Cronos is focused on bridging different blockchain ecosystems, making it easier for developers and users alike to move assets across different networks. If you’re someone looking for a project that’s scalable and has a strong community, Cronos might just be your ticket. Despite its promising tech and growing adoption, Cronos faces stiff competition in the DeFi space from giants like Ethereum and Solana. However, its close ties with Crypto.com give it a unique advantage, especially in terms of mainstream adoption and user accessibility. If you’re looking for a project that is building a powerful infrastructure for the future of decentralized finance, Cronos is certainly one to keep an eye on. Conclusion: The Future of Crypto Is Bright — Get In Now As we’ve seen, Qubetics, Cronos, and Hedera are three projects that have all the right ingredients to succeed in the evolving world of blockchain technology. Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet, Cronos’ DeFi ecosystem, or Hedera’s enterprise-ready scalability, these cryptos are positioning themselves for long-term growth. But if you’re looking for a project with explosive potential, Qubetics is the one to watch. With its presale raising millions and a future price prediction of $10-$15 per $TICS token after the mainnet launch, it’s clear that Qubetics is poised to be a major player in the crypto space. Add this to your portfolio now, and you could be looking at some seriously impressive returns in the near future. So, what are you waiting for? The best cryptos to invest in now are right in front of you. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to be part of the future of digital finance with Qubetics, Cronos, and Hedera.

Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, presented Bitcoin strategic reserve for Microsoft (MSFT) boards on Dec. 01 as he promised earlier . He highlighted that Bitcoin is a transformation of digital capital, and they need to adopt Bitcoin as part of their balance sheet in the next few years. Bitcoin is projected to be one of the biggest assets in the world and account for $280 trillion of global wealth, which exceeds gold and art by the next 20 years with $45 trillion and $110 trillion, respectively. Saylor also noted that Microsoft clearly needed to be powered by digital capital as the price movement of Bitcoin outperformed Microsoft shares by 12 times annually. MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares also jumped to 3,045% after acquiring Bitcoin in the past few years, while MSFT only performed 103%. “Bitcoin is the best asset that you can own. The number’s speaks for themselves. It is make alot more sense to buy Bitcoin than buy your own stock back, or to hold Bitcoin rather than holding bonds. If you wanted to outperform you gotta need Bitcoin,” Saylor mention on his presentation posted on YouTube. Political and market support, which is represented by Trump’s administration and Bitcoin ETF’s products in the stock market, will also make Bitcoin massively adopted in the next few years, so Microsoft has, too.

These digital assets have garnered attention for different reasons, from Dogecoin’s meme-driven popularity to XRP’s robust utility in cross-border transactions and PropiChain’s innovative approach to real estate investment. As investors seek the next big opportunity, the question arises: Which of these altcoins will soon create the most millionaires? Dogecoin Price Surge: Excitement or Overhype? The Dogecoin price is again making waves in the crypto world, surging to a live price of $0.3933 with an impressive 24-hour trading volume of $11.45 billion. This momentum, fueled by a remarkable 169.64% increase in the last 30 days, has cemented DOGE’s position as the #7 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at $57.77 billion. While the Dogecoin price rise is undeniably captivating, its foundation remains tied to external factors like the influence of Elon Musk’s tweets. This dependency makes DOGE a volatile investment. Without robust utility or innovation underpinning its growth, Dogecoin price faces challenges in maintaining its long-term appeal for serious investors. Legal Optimism Fuels a Record-Breaking XRP Price Rally The XRP price has surged an astonishing 218.68% since November 5, marking a remarkable rebound from its early November price of $0.51343. Currently trading at $1.67, XRP price is just 14% shy of its 2021 peak, with analysts setting their sights on a bold target of $4.20. This rally is underpinned by bullish technical indicators, particularly a golden cross, a rare alignment of the 50-day and 200-day SMAs on weekly charts. Historically, such signals have preceded the XRP price all-time highs, intensifying excitement among investors. Regulatory optimism and institutional adoption drive the XRP price growth, with trading volume at $8.4 billion. As Ripple’s SEC battle nears resolution, XRP price is poised to lead the crypto market and potentially achieve record-breaking performance. PCHAIN Beats Dogecoin Price and XRP Price PropiChain (PCHAIN) is poised to outperform the Dogecoin price and XRP price by revolutionizing the $300 trillion real estate market through blockchain and AI integration. Unlike Dogecoin’s meme-driven value and XRP’s regulatory challenges, PropiChain offers tangible utility by tokenizing real estate assets, enabling fractional ownership, and automating transactions via smart contracts. This approach democratizes property investment, providing stability and substantial growth potential. Analysts project that PropiChain could deliver returns up to 12,204%, surpassing the speculative gains of Dogecoin price and XRP price. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Revolutionizing Real Estate with Blockchain, AI, and NFTs PropiChain is reshaping the real estate space by combining blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and NFTs to address the inefficiencies of traditional property management. Built on a decentralized platform, PropiChain transforms real estate investment, ownership, and management into a simplified, secure, and globally accessible space. At its core, PropiChain leverages NFT tokenization to convert physical properties into digital assets. These NFTs represent ownership stakes, enabling fractional ownership where users can buy, sell, or trade portions of high-value properties. This democratization of real estate makes it accessible to a broader audience, eliminating barriers like exorbitant capital requirements and opaque pricing models. By tokenizing real estate, PropiChain brings liquidity to one of the most illiquid asset classes, allowing investors to diversify portfolios and easily trade their stakes. PropiChain’s integration of AI takes real estate management to new heights. The platform delivers real-time insights into property values, market trends, and investment opportunities through automated valuation models and predictive market analytics. Users can automate transactions based on specific conditions, optimizing strategies and minimizing risks. For instance, AI-powered tools can execute property purchases or sales automatically when predefined market criteria are met, ensuring efficiency and accuracy. PropiChain introduces the Propiverse, a metaverse-enabled feature that revolutionizes how investors explore and evaluate properties. Through immersive 3D virtual tours, users can interact with properties as if they were physically present. This eliminates geographical barriers and broadens investment opportunities. The PropiChain platform employs blockchain-based smart contracts to automate lease agreements, rental payments, and renewals. These contracts are tamper-proof and self-executing, ensuring transparency, reducing administrative burdens, and eliminating the need for intermediaries. Why Now Is the Best Time to Invest in PropiChain PropiChain’s presale offers a compelling opportunity for early investors, with the token currently priced at just $0.004. This low entry point is set to rise to $0.011 in stage two and climb even higher in later stages, rewarding those who act quickly with significant cost advantages. Early adopters benefit from discounted pricing and first-mover advantages, bolstered by PropiChain’s listing on CoinMarketCap and BlockAudit -certified security measures, which underscore its credibility. PropiChain outshines the Dogecoin price and XRP price by offering real-world utility and unmatched growth potential, making it the top choice for investors seeking high ROI and transformative opportunities. With the growing presale investments, now is the perfect time to seize this groundbreaking investment.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 02:27:00

There was a break above a short-term bearish trend line with resistance at $96,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).

Lightchain AI , priced at just $0.07 during its presale, is emerging as a transformative force in blockchain innovation. With its unique integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and cutting-edge decentralized technology, experts believe Lightchain AI could redefine how industries leverage blockchain. Why Lightchain AI Is a Game-Changer Lightchain AI is not just another cryptocurrency—it’s a platform designed to solve real-world challenges while pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology. Its revolutionary features, including Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , set it apart from traditional blockchains. Key Innovations That Stand Out: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Lightchain AI’s consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing AI computations, such as machine learning and data analysis, making it eco-friendly and utility-driven. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): AIVM enables the seamless execution of AI tasks directly on the blockchain, offering industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics an advanced, decentralized solution.

The large-cap altcoin surged over 25 percent in the last 24 hours to trade about $2.4 on Monday, December 2, during the early Asian session. The utility-based altcoin, with a market cap of about $140 billion and a fully diluted valuation of over $240 billion, registered a 45 percent surge in daily average traded volume to about $23 billion at the time of this report. Why Did XRP Go Up? As Coinpedia previously noted, XRP price has significantly benefited from the election of pro-crypto leaders in the United States, led by President-elect Donald Trump. The long-standing legal hurdles emanating from the US SEC charges are likely to be dropped once a new SEC chair is confirmed early next year. The notable rise of XRP in the past 24 hours is partly attributed to the heavy liquidation of short traders. According to data from Coinglass, XRP’s leveraged market-led in liquidations during the past 24 hours of more than $50 million, with over $36 million involving short traders. Consequently, the odds of a short squeeze have significantly increased the ongoing XRP’s bullish outlook. 500,000,000 #XRP (945,196,977 USD) unlocked from escrow at unknown wallet https://t.co/BiPf94ED2q — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 1, 2024 In the last 24 hours, on-chain data shows a heightened activity of whale traders, led by Ripple. For instance, Ripple unlocked 1 billion XRP units from the escrow account and locked back over 800 million units. Meanwhile, several transactions involved whale investors withdrawing huge amounts of XRP from different exchanges led by Upbit and Binance . What Next For XRP Price? pic.twitter.com/1kuFxoWxM0 — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 1, 2024 Following a 280 percent surge in November, XRP price has officially broken out of a multi-year triangular consolidation. The veteran altcoin is now on the verge of retesting its all-time high (ATH), which was set in 2018 after surpassing its 2021 bull cycle peak. From a technical analysis standpoint, XRP price has entered its much anticipated parabolic phase, which could yield further gains in the coming months. Already, the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has surged above the 85 percent level for the first time since 2021, signaling the bulls are in control.

It can be a tough choice with so many options out there. But if you’re keeping an eye on the right projects, some are starting to shine brighter than the rest. Solana and Fantom are two of the heavyweights that have been causing waves in the blockchain world. Solana’s blazing-fast transaction speeds and low costs make it a go-to for developers, while Fantom is becoming the favourite for DeFi enthusiasts with its lightning-fast and scalable platform. Both projects continue to grow and bring exciting new features to the space, proving why they’re often listed among the best crypto to invest in right now. However, there’s a new player in town that’s starting to make a serious splash—Qubetics. With its innovative Decentralised VPN (dVPN), Qubetics is carving out its own niche in the crypto world. Plus, with Qubetics currently in its presale phase, analysts predict a significant price surge to $10 to $15 after its mainnet launch. For anyone looking to get ahead of the curve, Qubetics could just be one of the best crypto to invest in right now. Solana: Speed and Efficiency for the Future When you’re talking about the best crypto to invest in, Solana is a name that you can’t ignore. Known for its incredibly fast transaction speeds, Solana has gained a strong following in the crypto community. This high-performance blockchain has been able to scale without compromising on decentralisation or security, which makes it stand out among its peers. Solana’s proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism allows transactions to be processed at lightning speed, making it one of the most efficient platforms available. What’s exciting about Solana is its rapidly expanding ecosystem. From DeFi platforms to NFTs, the network is seeing more and more developers flocking to it due to its low transaction costs and high throughput. Solana’s growing popularity and adoption continue to drive its price upward, which makes it a solid choice if you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in today. And with the network’s constant development, Solana is set to remain a key player in the crypto space for the foreseeable future. Fantom: Fast, Scalable, and Ready for DeFi Fantom is another rising star in the world of crypto. If you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in for the long term, Fantom should definitely be on your radar. This blockchain platform offers quick, secure transactions, thanks to its unique consensus mechanism, Lachesis. Fantom’s low transaction fees and high throughput make it perfect for building decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. And as the DeFi space continues to grow, Fantom is positioning itself as a go-to platform for developers. What sets Fantom apart is its ability to interoperate with other blockchains, especially Ethereum. This means developers can use Fantom to build dApps that are easily integrated with other networks, making it more versatile than many other blockchain platforms. Fantom’s fast-growing ecosystem and focus on decentralisation make it a great contender for the best crypto to invest in right now, and its performance over the last year shows just how much potential it holds for the future. Qubetics: The Future of Decentralised VPN and Security Qubetics is focusing on an area that’s quickly becoming a hot topic—privacy and security. With its Decentralised VPN (dVPN), Qubetics is offering a solution to one of the biggest issues on the internet today: data security. Traditional VPNs come with their own set of problems, from data storage risks to reliance on centralised service providers. Qubetics aims to solve these issues by offering a fully decentralised alternative that puts users back in control of their data. What makes Qubetics particularly appealing is that it’s not just a privacy-focused project, it’s also a tech powerhouse. With the launch of the QubeQode IDE, Qubetics is creating an ecosystem where developers can build and deploy decentralised applications (dApps) in a secure, private, and efficient manner. This will drive more innovation within the decentralised space, bringing more use cases for Qubetics’ token. Analysts predict that the price of Qubetics could surge to $10-$15 after the mainnet launch, making it one of the best crypto to invest in today if you’re looking to get in on the ground floor of a truly disruptive project. With its presale already raising millions and attracting thousands of investors, Qubetics is showing all the signs of a major player in the crypto world. The project’s commitment to security, privacy, and decentralisation is resonating with users and investors alike, and with more features like the QubeQode IDE in the pipeline, it’s only a matter of time before Qubetics becomes a household name in the blockchain space. Conclusion While Solana and Fantom continue to impress with their speed, scalability, and growing ecosystems, Qubetics brings a fresh approach by focusing on privacy and decentralisation. The project’s dVPN offering is filling a much-needed gap in the market, while its upcoming mainnet launch has analysts predicting significant price growth. If you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in today , Qubetics could be the project that not only keeps you ahead of the curve but also delivers substantial returns in the future. With its presale generating excitement and a clear roadmap ahead, Qubetics is definitely worth keeping an eye on. So, if you’re ready to get in early on a project that’s set to revolutionise the world of decentralised internet security, Qubetics might just be the best crypto to invest in right now. Don’t miss out on this exciting opportunity—join the presale and get ready for the future of blockchain technology!

ETH is showing bullish signs and might soon aim for a move above the $3,800 resistance zone. Ethereum started a decent increase from the $3,550 zone. The price is trading above $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,700 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could restart its increase if it clears the $3,750 zone. Ethereum Price Eyes Steady Increase Ethereum price remained supported above $3,350 and started a fresh increase like Bitcoin . ETH was able to surpass the $3,450 and $3,550 resistance levels. The bulls pumped the price above the $3,700 level. A high was formed at $3,748 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $3,720 level. The price dipped and tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $3,572 swing low to the $3,748 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,700 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,740 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,750 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,800. A clear move above the $3,800 resistance might send the price toward the $3,880 resistance. An upside break above the $3,880 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,940 resistance zone or even $4,000. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,750 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,700 level. The first major support sits near the $3,675 zone. A clear move below the $3,675 support might push the price toward the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $3,572 swing low to the $3,748 high at $3,640. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,570 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,550.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 03:57:00

The 364% XRP rally in November calls for a new all-time high beyond $4.3. XRP Price to New All-Time High? The XRP Price could be making a move to its new all-time high in December itself. The third-largest altcoin has achieved a significant milestone, breaking out of 84 months of stagnant price action with a single explosive XRP monthly candle . This dramatic move marks a turning point for the cryptocurrency, potentially signaling the start of a new trend after years of consolidation. Veteran trader Peter Brandt shares a classic breakout from a flag-and-pole pattern on a multi-year timeframe. Source: Peter Brandt With more than 75% weekly gains, XRP is dominating the entire altcoin space outperforming other giants like Ethereum. As a result, crypto market experts are once again stressing the need to have a spot XRP ETF in the market. Three major firms—Bitwise, Canary, and 21Shares—have filed applications for spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), targeting the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Nate Geraci, the President of ETH Store believes that additional issuers are likely to join the race, with the growing interest in XRP-based investment products. Pro-XRP lawyer Jeremy Hogan believes that a spot XRP ETF could come by mid-2025. There are currently 3 filings for ETFs holding what is now the 3rd largest crypto asset by market cap… Bitwise, Canary, & 21Shares have all filed for spot XRP ETFs. Guessing addn’l issuers will jump in here. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 2, 2024 As of press time, the XRP price is trading 27% up at $2.40 with a market cap of $136 billion. The Coinglass data shows that the XRP open interest has surged 28.67% moving all the way to $4.21 billion. Also, the 24-hour liquidations have shot up to $53 million with $38 million in short liquidations and over $14 million in long liquidations. Some market analysts believe that the XRP is eyeing the next leg of the rally to $4.3. A Walk Down the Memory Lane When XRP Dominated Solana, USDT The XRP price rally helped it overtake Tether (USDT) to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, marking a return to its pre-SEC lawsuit position. Historically, XRP held the second spot behind Bitcoin (BTC) until the SEC’s 2018 Hinman speech, which classified Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) as non-securities under the “sufficiently decentralized” framework. Back then it was trading much above other rivals like Solana, USDT, BNB Coin, etc. Ethereum’s market cap surpassed XRP’s in November 2018, reshaping the crypto rankings. XRP’s recent surge now revives its position among the top-tier cryptocurrencies. In December 2020, the US SEC lawsuit against Ripple caused XRP’s price to plummet from around $0.50 to $0.17, wiping out over $15 billion in market value. Although the price eventually recovered, XRP remained at the 7 spot for the next four years. XRP Lawyer John Deaton provides a complete overview of how XRP was the go-to cryptocurrency for businesses while the XRP Ledger was the most preferred platform for instant cross-border settlement. Talking about his long-going battle with the US SEC in the Ripple lawsuit, Deaton wrote: “I sued the SEC b/c what it did was wrong. I’m not talking about Ripple. The SEC sues lots of companies. I’m talking about the absurd allegation that XRP itself was illegal, including if acquired by USERS of the XRPL or by people who’d never heard of Brad Garlinghouse, Chris Larsen, or Ripple”. Below is a complete timeline of how Ripple’s XRP gained prominence in the early days before facing the regulatory heat in 2020. THE RETURN OF XRP With XRP overtaking SOL, above $2, and approaching a $120B market cap, allow me to reflect. When I sued the SEC, people assumed I was a huge XRP holder. The truth is, when the @Ripple case was filed, 50% of my net worth was in BTC. Today, it’s 80%.

Bitcoin’s price keeps flirting with new highs, Ethereum’s updates promise to reshape decentralised finance, and rising stars like Qubetics ($TICS) are turning heads with their unique offerings and explosive growth potential. While volatility is the name of the game, it’s also what makes crypto such an exciting space for high-return investments. Among the standout players, Qubetics is making waves for all the right reasons. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics isn’t just another cryptocurrency—it’s solving problems that other blockchains have struggled to address. With applications like decentralised VPNs and a record-breaking presale, $TICS is a name that keeps popping up in discussions about the best cryptos to invest in 2024. Let’s break down what makes these five coins top contenders for your portfolio this year. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Qubetics has set out to unify the blockchain universe, and it’s doing so with game-changing features. One of its standout applications is its decentralised VPN, a privacy-focused tool that not only secures internet connections but also incentivises users by rewarding them with $TICS tokens for sharing unused bandwidth. It’s a win-win for businesses and individuals alike. Picture this: a small business running sensitive transactions across various locations. With Qubetics’ dVPN, data breaches have become a thing of the past. Or imagine an avid gamer who wants a lag-free experience while ensuring their data isn’t being sold to third parties. Qubetics offers a seamless solution, proving its real-world value. The numbers don’t lie. Qubetics’ presale is currently in its 10th stage, with over 251 million tokens sold to more than 5,300 holders, raising $3.9 million. At $0.025 per token, analysts predict mind-blowing returns, with $TICS potentially hitting $15 post-mainnet launch. A $1,000 investment today buys 40,000 tokens. By the presale’s end at $0.25, that’s $10,000. If the price reaches $15, it skyrockets to $600,000. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics isn’t just about profits; it’s about solving real-world problems while creating opportunities for unprecedented growth. 2. Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin remains the gold standard in crypto. As the first and most recognised cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s dominance is unmatched. But as much as it’s hailed as “digital gold,” its use cases are limited by slow transaction speeds and high fees. Despite this, Bitcoin’s value proposition as a store of value continues to attract institutional investors. Recently, Bitcoin has been making headlines as its price stabilises above $37,000. Analysts predict that a bull market could push BTC back to its previous highs of $60,000 or even beyond. For investors looking for stability in an otherwise volatile market, Bitcoin remains a solid pick. Think about it: a $1,000 investment in Bitcoin at its current price secures about 0.027 BTC. If Bitcoin reaches $60,000, that investment becomes $1,620. Not bad for a low-risk addition to your portfolio, though it pales in comparison to the ROI potential of newer players like Qubetics. Why did this coin make it to this list? Bitcoin’s reliability and market dominance make it a cornerstone for any diversified crypto portfolio. 3. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s an entire ecosystem powering decentralised finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts. With its recent shift to a proof-of-stake model, Ethereum is also becoming more energy-efficient, addressing one of its biggest criticisms. Ethereum’s latest upgrade, known as the “Shanghai update,” is expected to enhance scalability and lower transaction costs. These improvements are crucial for DeFi platforms and dApps, which rely on Ethereum’s infrastructure. Imagine a startup building a lending platform that connects borrowers and lenders without banks. Ethereum makes it possible. Currently priced around $1,800, Ethereum is projected to reach $3,000 by the end of 2024. A $1,000 investment today buys about 0.55 ETH. If the price hits $3,000, that investment grows to $1,650. While it’s not as flashy as Qubetics’ projections, Ethereum’s proven track record makes it a safe bet. Why did this coin make it to this list? Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi and its role as the backbone of blockchain innovation make it indispensable. 4. Solana (SOL): Solana has earned a reputation as one of the fastest blockchains in the world, with transaction speeds clocking in at 65,000 transactions per second. It’s a developer’s dream, enabling the creation of dApps and DeFi platforms without the bottlenecks seen on Ethereum. Recent developments include Solana’s growing NFT ecosystem and its focus on gaming applications. For example, imagine a gaming platform where players can trade in-game assets instantly and with minimal fees. Solana’s speed and low costs make this a reality. SOL is currently priced around $35, with analysts predicting it could hit $80 in 2024. A $1,000 investment secures about 28.57 SOL. If the price reaches $80, that investment grows to $2,286. It’s not the explosive growth of Qubetics, but Solana’s focus on speed and scalability ensures it remains a top contender. Why did this coin make it to this list? Solana’s unmatched speed and low costs make it a go-to for developers and investors alike. 5. Cardano (ADA) Cardano takes a methodical approach to blockchain development, using peer-reviewed research to inform its upgrades. Its Hydra scaling solution promises to make Cardano one of the most scalable platforms, capable of handling microtransactions and enterprise-level applications. For instance, imagine a global non-profit using Cardano to distribute aid transparently and efficiently. Its scalability and focus on sustainability make it a compelling choice for real-world applications. Currently priced at $0.26, ADA is projected to reach $0.50 in 2024. A $1,000 investment buys about 3,846 ADA tokens. If the price doubles to $0.50, that investment becomes $1,923. While the returns aren’t as eye-popping as those of Qubetics, Cardano’s long-term vision and steady growth make it a strong candidate. Why did this coin make it to this list? Cardano’s focus on sustainability and real-world applications ensures its relevance in an evolving market. Conclusion: Choosing the Best Cryptos to Invest When it comes to the best cryptos to invest in 2024, each coin on this list brings something unique to the table. Bitcoin offers stability, Ethereum powers innovation, Solana delivers speed, and Cardano provides a sustainable vision. But Qubetics stands out for its ability to solve real-world problems while offering explosive ROI potential. With its presale nearing a price hike, now’s the perfect time to secure $TICS tokens and position yourself for incredible returns. Don’t miss out—the future of crypto is here, and it’s called Qubetics.

The price even meteorically increases by 365% from $0.51 in the past month, making them the top gainers along with Peanut (PNUT), Stellar (XLM), and Hedera (HBAR). The price movement also made XRP’s market capitalization as the third largest in the world after surging 26% to $136 billion, surpassing Tether ( USDT ) and Solana ( SOL ) with $134 billion and $108 billion, respectively. 1 Day XRP price chart, September 08 – December 02, 2024 | Source: crypto.news The tokens were also actively traded for about $26.41 billion, or an increase of 75% in a day. Earlier last week, XRP had already flipped Binance’s BNB after they reached $97 billion in market cap, while BNB was still on their $95 billion. Ripple’s business expansion and market optimism pushed the price movement and headed to the all-time high record of $3.8 that was reached 7 years ago.

Meanwhile, analysts are sounding alarms about the potential volatility surrounding XRP, especially in light of its recent surge to multi-year highs. XRP Surges to 2021 Highs Amid Leverage Concerns and Market Buzz Ripple’s native token, XRP , has seen an explosive rally, with its price reaching levels not witnessed since 2021. However, analysts warn the surge may be ”leverage-driven,” cautioning traders about potential volatility as open interest in XRP derivatives reaches record levels. In a Dec. 1 post on X, CryptoQuant analyst Maarten Regterschot sounded the alarm on XRP’s open interest, which saw a massive 37% spike in just 24 hours. Open interest measures the total number of active derivatives contracts, such as futures and options, and its sudden increase often precedes heightened price volatility. “Open Interest is up 37% already — watch for volatility. The last similar event led to a -17% drawdown,” Maarten warned. “Stay sharp, manage risk accordingly.” CoinGlass data corroborates Maarten’s analysis, showing that XRP’s open interest has climbed 30% in the past day to reach $4 billion across major exchanges. Such a sharp increase often signals that traders are leveraging positions to capitalize on the rally, but it also raises the risk of sudden sell-offs. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.39, marking a staggering 68% gain over the past month. The token’s performance has been particularly strong in the past week, during which it soared nearly 70%. Year-to-date, XRP has posted an eye-popping 370% increase, significantly outperforming most other major cryptocurrencies. The rally comes on the heels of bullish sentiment sweeping the crypto markets following Donald Trump’s election victory on Nov. 6. While Bitcoin and Solana also posted significant gains, XRP has been a standout performer, driven by a confluence of factors. On Dec. 1, XRP surpassed Solana in market capitalization and has since leapfrogged Tether, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency by total value. Its market cap now sits behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. The token’s outsized performance has been attributed to a variety of catalysts, including Ripple Labs’ strategic partnerships, new product rollouts, and growing speculation about an XRP-focused exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). Several developments have bolstered investor confidence in XRP: Ripple’s Key PartnershipsRipple Labs has secured a series of high-profile partnerships aimed at expanding the use of XRP for cross-border payments. These collaborations have strengthened the token’s utility and reinforced its value proposition. XRP ETF SpeculationOn Nov. 1, 2024, asset manager 21Shares filed for an XRP ETF, fueling expectations that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve the application. Optimism has also grown amid reports of likely leadership changes at the SEC in January 2025, which could usher in a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Rumors of Elon Musk’s InvolvementUnverified reports suggesting that Elon Musk may invest heavily in XRP and Ripple have further amplified market excitement. While these rumors remain speculative, they have contributed to the token’s bullish momentum. Analysts Urge Caution Despite the euphoria, analysts like Maarten are urging caution, emphasizing the risks associated with a leverage-driven rally. Historical patterns suggest that rapid increases in open interest often lead to abrupt market corrections. The last time XRP experienced a similar spike, the price saw a sharp 17% decline shortly afterward. Traders are advised to monitor market conditions closely and manage their risk exposure. The combination of leverage, speculative activity, and heightened volatility could lead to significant price swings in the short term. With XRP’s price hitting new multi-year highs, its market performance will remain under close scrutiny. Key developments to watch include the SEC’s decision on XRP ETF applications, the validity of rumors surrounding Musk’s involvement, and Ripple Labs’ continued efforts to expand the token’s adoption. The crypto community is divided between those celebrating XRP’s resurgence and those wary of the risks posed by leverage and speculation. As the narrative unfolds, XRP’s trajectory could set the tone for broader market dynamics heading into 2025. Ripple CTO David Schwartz Condemns Operation Chokepoint 2.0, Citing Threats to Civil Liberties In a related development, Ripple’s Chief Technical Officer, David Schwartz, has joined the growing chorus of tech leaders denouncing Operation Chokepoint 2.0—a purported government initiative targeting the crypto industry through debanking. Schwartz criticized the operation for undermining the rule of law and threatening fundamental civil liberties, while urging regulators to adopt transparent and lawful processes. In a recent statement, Schwartz accused the government of being ”addicted to indirect regulation,” using debanking as a tool to suppress industries without following due legal processes. He identified four critical ways in which debanking undermines civil liberties: Evasion of Surveillance and SanctionsSchwartz argued that debanked entities often resort to switching service providers or taking their funds underground. This not only limits governmental oversight but also reduces the effectiveness of sanctions enforcement. Violation of Due ProcessBy pressuring financial institutions to cut ties with certain businesses, the government circumvents the judicial process, effectively punishing entities without formally charging them with a crime. Infringement on Free SpeechSchwartz linked debanking to restrictions on freedom of speech, noting that financial exclusion can stifle dissenting voices and disfavored industries. Encroachment on Privacy RightsThe CTO criticized the practice for enabling what he described as unlawful search and seizure, with banks being pressured to act as extensions of regulatory agencies. “Our government has become addicted to indirect regulation precisely because of these evils,” Schwartz stated. “It is cheaper and easier to pressure someone else to punish me than to charge me with a crime and give me due process.” He implored regulators to abandon covert tactics in favor of lawful and transparent mechanisms, adding, “It is easier to pressure banks to cut off disfavored businesses than to make that business illegal.” The Fallout from Operation Chokepoint 2.0 The crypto industry has faced significant challenges under what many executives describe as a coordinated effort to choke off financial access. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, claimed that more than 30 tech firms have been victims of the operation. Other prominent voices have shared similar experiences: Sam Kazemian (Frax Finance)The founder alleged that JPMorgan Chase debanked him in December 2022, reflecting a broader pattern of financial institutions severing ties with crypto firms. Brian Armstrong (Coinbase)Coinbase’s co-founder and CEO has formally requested records related to Operation Chokepoint 2.0 under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and is compiling evidence of what he describes as systemic debanking. Nic Carter (Castle Island Ventures)In September 2024, Carter accused the Biden administration of deliberately orchestrating the collapse of Silvergate Bank—a pivotal institution for the crypto sector. “I believe Silvergate could have survived its drawdown — and was on a path to do so,” Carter said. Schwartz’s remarks come amid growing scrutiny of government actions targeting the crypto sector. Industry stakeholders have expressed hope that the incoming Trump administration, set to take office in 2025, will reverse what many perceive as regulatory hostility. Optimism centers on the possibility of fostering a more balanced regulatory environment that encourages innovation while addressing legitimate concerns about financial stability and compliance. Industry insiders believe such a shift could restore confidence in the United States as a hub for blockchain and cryptocurrency development. While Operation Chokepoint 2.0 has caused significant disruption, the crypto industry remains resilient. Ripple’s David Schwartz and other industry leaders continue to advocate for fair and transparent regulations, underscoring the need to protect civil liberties while fostering technological progress. The debate over crypto regulation reflects broader tensions between innovation and oversight, with the outcome likely to shape the future of the digital economy.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-02 05:29:36

As Bitcoin (BTC) price failed to reach the much-hyped target of $100k in November, investors’ focus has gradually shifted to the altcoin industry in the recent past led by Ethereum (ETH), Ripple’s XRP, Hedera (HBAR), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana (SOL), among many others. Major Paradigm Shift in Investing Models According to Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO at CryptoQuant, the ongoing altseason is no longer defined by crypto cash rotation from Bitcoin. Moreover, Bitcoin price has not registered notable cash outflows in the recent past to guarantee a significant spike in large-cap altcoins. Instead, Ju highlighted that the notable altcoin growth is majorly attributed to stablecoin and fiat pairs, which reflects real market growth rather than asset rotation.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been a top performer in previous cycles, new data suggests a rising contender could outshine the popular meme coin. That token is Lightchain AI , a revolutionary blockchain project blending artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. With its innovative approach and growing ecosystem, Lightchain AI is positioned to redefine the market narrative. What Makes Lightchain AI a Stronger Contender Than SHIB? 1. Real-World Utility Over Memes While SHIB owes much of its success to community-driven hype and branding, Lightchain AI’s foundation lies in real-world applications. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism incentivizes meaningful AI computations, enabling applications like machine learning, data analytics, and predictive modeling—all while maintaining scalability and sustainability. 2. Early-Stage Investment Potential SHIB has already experienced its meteoric rise, and while it remains a strong community-driven asset, Lightchain AI is in its presale phase , offering a rare chance to invest at a ground-floor price. Investors who recognized SHIB’s potential early saw life-changing gains, and Lightchain AI provides a similar opportunity for exponential growth. 3. Broader Market Appeal Lightchain AI’s dual focus appeals to a wider range of investors: Enterprise Solutions: Its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) empowers businesses to leverage decentralized AI for critical tasks. Retail Speculators: Features like the upcoming meme coin pump pad position it as a unique platform for high-energy market movements. By catering to both institutional and retail audiences, Lightchain AI combines the best of utility and speculative potential. SHIB’s Strengths and Its Limitations SHIB has earned its place as a top meme coin, boasting a loyal community and expanding utility with its Shibarium Layer 2 solution. However, its value largely depends on speculative sentiment, and many investors are looking for tokens with more tangible use cases in the long term. Key Challenges for SHIB: Market Saturation: The meme coin space is increasingly crowded, making it harder for SHIB to maintain its dominance. Utility Limitations: While its ecosystem is growing, SHIB’s primary value driver remains community hype. Lightchain AI addresses these gaps by combining speculative appeal with technological innovation, offering a more robust investment case. Why Lightchain AI Could Dominate the Next Bull Run Technological Innovation No other project combines blockchain and AI as effectively as Lightchain AI. Its ability to perform AI-specific tasks on-chain opens doors to industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics, creating a vast market for its native token, LCAI. Massive Growth Potential Analysts predict that AI and blockchain integration will be a trillion-dollar market by 2030. By being an early mover in this space, Lightchain AI positions itself for unparalleled adoption and value appreciation. Presale Momentum Lightchain AI’s ongoing presale has already raised significant capital, reflecting strong investor confidence. As it transitions into mainstream trading, early adopters could see exponential returns. Should You Bet on Lightchain AI Over SHIB? While SHIB remains a fan favorite and could perform well in the next bull run, Lightchain AI offers a more compelling investment narrative. Its combination of cutting-edge technology, real-world applications, and early-stage pricing makes it a standout choice for investors seeking both short-term excitement and long-term value. Join the Lightchain AI Revolution With the next bull run on the horizon, there’s no better time to explore projects with the potential to redefine the crypto landscape. Lightchain AI is more than just a token—it’s a movement bridging AI and blockchain for the future. Don’t miss your chance to secure your place in this revolutionary project.

This marks a major milestone, bringing XRP back to where it was before Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC . Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett recently highlighted XRP’s challenges, noting it was once the second-largest cryptocurrency before the SEC’s 2018 Hinman speech. The speech classified Bitcoin and Ethereum as non-securities, causing XRP to lose its position to Ethereum by November 2018 due to regulatory uncertainty. Documents from the Ripple case, known as the “ Hinman emails ,” revealed internal SEC disagreements about the speech’s impact on other cryptocurrencies. Six years later, XRP’s regulatory status remains unclear, fueling ongoing debates on how cryptocurrencies should be classified. John Deaton’s Legal Battle for XRP’s Fairness Attorney John Deaton has been a key figure in XRP’s legal journey. Reflecting on his battle against the SEC, Deaton revealed that his initial XRP holdings were modest compared to his investments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the SEC’s claim that all XRP transactions were illegal motivated him to step up and defend not just Ripple but also XRP’s global users. Deaton highlighted key inconsistencies in the SEC’s actions. In 2014, the U.S. Government Accountability Office classified XRP as a virtual currency. In 2015, FinCEN declared XRP a currency and set compliance rules for Ripple. By 2019, Coinbase listed XRP after thorough legal reviews, and MoneyGram publicly disclosed using XRP in its business. Despite these validations, the SEC filed its lawsuit in December 2020, calling XRP an unregistered security and sending shockwaves through the crypto world. But it’s not just Deaton who supported XRP, the 75000 XRP army also made it possible and stayed strong in all phases of XRP. Many investors have doubled their holdings just to show their confidence in XRP. Amid the ongoing Ripple vs SEC battle, uncover what’s next for XRP—read XRP price prediction and see why analysts are bullish! XRP Price Surge XRP closed November with a whopping 3x rally, hitting a seven-year high. The crypto remained resilient despite releasing 1 billion tokens, which might concern newcomers unfamiliar with XRP’s tokenomics. After yesterday’s 2.4% dip, XRP has seen a 29% surge today and is currently trading at $2.44. As the new month begins, market watchers are eager to see how XRP performs amid increased trading volumes, suggesting the continuation of its recent momentum. Analysts are hopeful that XRP will see a massive jump in January after Gary Gensler steps down . FAQs What caused XRP’s recent price rally? XRP’s rally is fueled by legal updates, reduced regulatory uncertainty, and bullish technical breakouts driving a 3x gain in November. How does Ripple vs SEC affect XRP’s price? The Ripple vs SEC case has impacted XRP by creating legal uncertainty, but recent progress boosts investor confidence and price growth. How much will XRP be worth by the end of 2025?

The bullish sentiment peaking can be directly seen in the rising Bitcoin price. The cumulative digital assets market cap jumped marginally over the day to stand at $3.43 trillion. Its 24 hour trading volume spiked by 18% to hit the $181 billion mark. Analysts suggest that the Bitcoin balance of the crypto exchange is drying up amid high buying pressure. Ether ETFs attracted $466M last week According to reports , November 2024 saw Bitcoin ETFs attracting $6.5 billion in net inflows, while Ether ETFs garnered $1.1 billion. These figures represent all-time highs for both assets as crypto bulls took over after much anticipated Donald Trump’s US Presidential election win. With a Bitcoin surge , a climbing interest in Ether signals a growing speculative appetite for crypto. On Nov 29, nine Ether ETFs recorded a $333 million net inflow, with major players like BlackRock and Fidelity leading the charge. BlackRock’s ETHA has seen a cumulative inflow of $2.10 billion of inflow till now. Data provided by SosoValue shows that Ether ETFs pulled in over $466 million in the last week of November, while it saw an outflow of $71.60 million in the prior week. ETH price surged by 48% in the last 7 days. The biggest altcoin is trading at an average price of $3,691, at the press time. Bitcoin approached $100K in November but couldn’t make it through. However, Ether has outperformed Bitcoin since Trump’s election, though it has yet to hit new highs. BTC is trading at an average price of $96,892, at the press time. At the moment, XRP is printing huge green indexes as investors anticipate a reversal of the SEC crackdown. Some firms are already looking to launch XRP-focused ETFs. Trump has vowed to overhaul regulatory approaches, remove restrictions, and build more crypto-friendly policies. XRP price is up by 376% in the last 30 days. Ripple’s native crypto is trading at an average price of $2.44, at the press time. It is now the 3rd biggest crypto asset with a market cap of over $140 billion. Bitcoin balances on exchanges declining? Markus Thielen suggested in a post that Bitcoin balances on exchanges are rapidly decreasing, with no large inflows replenishing inventory as seen earlier this year. Only three exchanges—Bitfinex, Binance, and Coinbase currently have sufficient Bitcoin inventory, he added. Recent inflows into Bitcoin have been substantial which indicates that a bearish outlook is premature. Bitcoin is not only a topic at Thanksgiving dinners, but it’s also set to be a key discussion point during Christmas. He highlighted that the crypto market capitalization has now reached $3.43 trillion, with BTC’s dominance decreasing from 60% to 56%. This shift may signal the beginning of altcoin season, a phenomenon often driven by market sentiment. Since Trump’s election, the crypto market has seen a $1.2 trillion surge. This rally, building on the momentum of pro-crypto policies, is revitalizing the sector after the 2021 downturn.

Now, the cryptocurrency's price chart reveals a compelling pattern reminiscent of the set-up in bitcoin (BTC) before it chalked out a record rally last month. Ether's three-line break chart, which filters out day-to-day noise and erratic price movements, shows the cryptocurrency's eight-month corrective trend, characterized by lower highs and lower lows, has ended and the broader uptrend from the October 2023 lows near $1,500 has resumed. Such breakouts often trigger a bullish cascading effect on price by attracting new buyers and forcing out sellers that restricted price rallies during consolidation. Bitcoin witnessed a similar breakout in mid-October , signaling a rally to the then-record highs above $73,000. BTC has since surged 45% to over $96,000, according to data source TradingView and CoinDesk. While traders track price patterns to gauge trend strength and changes, they don't always work as intended and fundamental factors can single-handedly make or break trends. That said, the recent activity on the ethereum network supports the bullish case in ETH. The number of ""blobs"" posted on the Ethereum network by the layer 2 protocols surged in November. Posting blobs incurs fluctuating fees paid in ether, which are burned like regular transaction fees, taking out ETH's supply from the market. Meanwhile, mainstream investor interest in the token is rising. On Friday, the nine spot ether ETFs listed in the U.S. accumulated $332.9 million in inflows, the highest single tally since inception, according to Farside Investors .Read more: This Chart Indicates Bitcoin May Be Headed for Record Highs Above $73K",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-02 05:54:07

It broke higher and appears super bullish on the day. In November, Shiba saw few gains compared to other top meme coins like Doge, Pepe, and Bonk, which rallied hard within a few weeks. It posted small gains and quickly took a bullish break after testing the $0.00003 level. That break brought a three-week retracement and the price dropped near $0.00002. Holding this price level as support, it bounced back but no enough buying volume to bring the bulls back in action and the month ended indecisively. Starting this month on a strong note following a rising demand, trading volatility increased and the price exploded massively following the latest price break. The price is now looking strong again as it sits well above $0.000031 at the time of writing. The main obstacle for the bulls right now is the $0.000046 level, tested in March. Once they manage to push through, we should anticipate a major run from a long-term perspective. A drop from the current trading level could bring a slight retest before resuming bullish. Leading today’s meme coins rally, Shiba is up 30% in the past week as it makes a new shift. It is currently looking bullish on the daily chart. Shiba’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview On the way up, Shiba is facing a minor resistance at $0.000033 while the main resistance sits at $0.0000457. A break out there should skyrocket the price to $0.00006. In case of a drop, $0.00003 is the closest level to consider for support, followed by the $0.000023 level. Lower support levels for drops are $0.000016 and $0.0000125. Key Resistance Levels: $0.000033, $0.0000457, $0.00006 Key Support Levels: $0.000023, $0.000016, $0.0000125 Spot Price: $0.000032 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Historical data shows that the BTC rally can continue to another 46% in December. While BTC is currently flirting around $96,600, this rally could push it all the way to $141,000 by the year-end. Bitcoin Price to Rally in December? After a staggering 37.3% gain in November, Bitcoin is looking forward to a strong year-end in December. Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain reported that in December following the elections, Bitcoin price has surged by an average of 30-46% historically. As of press time, BTC price is trading at $96,922 with a market cap of $1.918 trillion. Thus, if Bitcoin replicates its previous performance, the $100K level seems to be easily achievable. With new FOMO-driven market dynamics, their updated model now predicts BTC could climb to $115K by the end of December if we consider 30% gains from here. In the case of a 46% surge, BTC price rally can further extend to $141K by December-end. Source: Spot On Chain Furthermore, popular crypto analyst Ben Armstrong aka BitBoy believes that Bitcoin price could rally to $100,000 levels in the next 48 hours from here. BitBoy bases his prediction on the BTC’s future perpetual data. He noted: “It’s time guys. The next 48 hours. BTC will hit $100,000. The moment we have waited for. Cherish it. We will only get it once”. Source: Bitboy Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Dropping Significantly As per the data from 10x Research , the Bitcoin supply from the exchanges could be drying up pretty fast. Unlike the late summer influx that temporarily boosted exchange inventories, current on-chain data reveals a sharp drop in supply. Furthermore, long-term holders remain steadfast, opting not to release Bitcoin into the market. This can provide an additional catalyst to Bitcoin price from here. Source: 10x Research On the other hand, the Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed more than $31 billion of inflows since their inception scooping massive supply from the market. As reported, the BlackRock traditional funds are also seeking exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs . 10x Research stated that as of now, only three exchanges – Bitfinex, Binance, and Coinbase, have enough BTC inventory. It added: “Considering that $30 billion in Bitcoin ETF inflows would only secure 300,000 BTC at current prices, Bitfinex’s reserves could last about one year, while Binance and Coinbase have enough supply”. Veteran Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo also confirmed this stating: “If you want some situational awareness of what’s going on, take a look at the BTC reserves on exchanges, nothing short of a supply shock. I don’t know who is buying, but short-term traders are selling their coins to a BTC vacuum cleaner”.

Speaking on CNN's Inside Politics today, Wood said reducing regulatory burdens could help the U.S. regain its position as a global leader in innovation. “The U.S. has almost lost ground in the crypto space,” Wood said, attributing the situation to overregulation during SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s tenure. He added that the Trump administration’s expected regulatory overhaul could spur growth in emerging sectors like crypto and artificial intelligence, allowing the country to regain a leadership position similar to its dominance during the early internet era. Related News: One Trader Makes 2580x Profit on Surprise Memecoin - Here Are His Trades “A change in the regulatory system where both crypto and AI are the main focuses would be quite significant,” Wood said. Cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence, as well as other transformative technologies such as robotics, energy storage and multiomics sequencing, are also critical platforms that the U.S. must “seize and exploit,” Wood said. Asked about Trump’s proposed tariffs on trading partners, Wood agreed with the approach, saying it made “some sense” if it was balanced with tax cuts to maintain competitiveness. Wood also commented on the potential impact of Trump's return on the stock market, predicting a shift away from the concentrated gains seen in recent years toward broader growth opportunities. “We’ve seen a huge concentration in a very small number of stocks over the last four years,” he said. “I think the market is going to expand right now and reward companies that are at the forefront of innovation.” That broader growth could particularly benefit small and medium-sized businesses, Wood said. *This is not investment advice.

It is likely to enter a correction mode if the price drops daily, though the trend is still bullish. As low-cap altcoins take the stage this week while Bitcoin decides the next move, Theta continued to show strength and exploded massively to a new multi-month high of $3.2 during the November rally. The rally was intercepted today being the first day of December, and as we can see on the daily chart, the price is currently down after a week of consistent increase, showing signs of weakness from the buying side. Despite that, the bulls are still in charge from a short-term perspective. We can expect more rallies if they show strong commitment in the next few hours. Otherwise, the crypto may correct lower before climbing back. Technically, this should provide a little discount in the market. So far, Theta has seen a significant recovery from where it was trading in the past month. While there’s still room for massive growth in the long term, the price must break above March’s high before considering a massive upsurge. All in all, it remains bullish on the daily timeframe. THETA’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview If the bulls counter the latest drop with a push above the recent rejected high, the next target level would be $3.82 – March’s high. A break up from there should send the price to $4 and $5 in no time. The potential support level to watch for the ongoing sell is $2.56. If the price drops below it, Theta may pull back to the $2.06 and $1.66 support before bouncing back.

Thanks to this, bullish predictions are flooding in, with targets as high as $250,000 in 2024 and $13 million long-term. Market dynamics, institutional adoption, and liquidity expansion are driving this optimism. Other macroeconomic events, like a potential Bitcoin reserve under Trump, fuel bullish sentiment even more. Meanwhile, Solv Protocol plans to transform Bitcoin into an active DeFi asset, inspired by MicroStrategy’s strategy of leveraging Bitcoin for yield and corporate growth. Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Correction to 60K Robert Kiyosaki, the well known author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, shared a bold prediction regarding Bitcoin (BTC), and suggested that its price may ”crash” to as low as $60,000. Despite this big potential downturn, Kiyosaki is still optimistic and unfazed. He sees such a correction as a buying opportunity, and stated that he will not sell but instead acquire more Bitcoin during the dip. At press time, Bitcoin is trading hands at $97,561, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The crypto recently reached an all-time high on Nov. 22 before experiencing a minor pullback to $90,742. This price movement reignited discussions about Bitcoin’s volatility and long-term potential. BTC’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) While some, like Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, believe Bitcoin is unlikely to fall below $80,000, Kiyosaki’s outlook focuses less on short-term price fluctuations and more on accumulation. He stated that at this stage, the number of Bitcoin held matters more than its immediate price. Kiyosaki also previously expressed his support for ultra-bullish predictions, like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor’s projection of Bitcoin reaching $13 million. Additionally, he recently referenced an unidentified AI model predicting Bitcoin will hit $500,000 by 2025. $150K Bitcoin Possible by Copying 2023 Performance Other Bitcoin predictions even suggest that the crypto could reach $250,000 in 2024 or hit $150,000 simply by replicating its 2023 price performance. Tom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, shared in an interview with Wealthion that Bitcoin's price cycles, especially those linked to block subsidy halving events, support these ambitious targets. According to Lee, the ”sweet spot” of Bitcoin’s bull run has already started, with the supply cut effects expected to drive massive price growth over the next year. Lee also pointed to a potential game-changer under a new U.S. administration, and suggested that a Bitcoin reserve strategy could lend some much needed legitimacy to the cryptocurrency. By drawing parallels with MicroStrategy, Lee mentioned how adopting Bitcoin as a balance-sheet asset generated immense value for the company’s shareholders. Lee is not the only one who sees massive potential in Bitcoin as commentators like The Bitcoin Therapist echoed a similar sentiment on social media. Meanwhile, other analysts are equally bullish. Trader Dave The Wave believed that Bitcoin could realistically reach $150,000 by mirroring its 186% gain between October of 2023 and March of 2024. He described this price surge as entirely feasible, especially given the current market dynamics and Bitcoin's historical performance. The combination of cyclical supply dynamics, institutional strategies, and market sentiment proves that there is a growing confidence in the cryptocurrency's potential for reaching six-figure valuations in the near future. Bitcoin in Its ‘Parabolic Phase’ Bitcoin is also entering what analysts describe as the ” parabolic phase ” of its current market cycle, with projections suggesting a potential local top of over $110,000 before the end of January. This optimistic forecast aligns with its correlation to the Global Macro Investor’s Total Liquidity Index, which aggregates the balance sheets of major central banks. According to Raoul Pal , CEO of Global Macro Investor, this price level is just a local peak for Bitcoin, with its right-hand side (RHS) potentially peaking in January 2025 before a correction below $70,000 by February. The expected dip is seen as temporary, driven by an ”interim peak in liquidity,” with liquidity projected to continue increasing into the third quarter of 2025. Historically, growing money supply was a major catalyst for Bitcoin's price. Bitget Wallet’s COO, Alvin Kan , pointed out that liquidity injections from the Federal Reserve typically create favorable market conditions for risk assets like Bitcoin as it spurs investor interest and inflows into the crypto market. Other analysts, including Jamie Coutts of Real Vision, suggested that Bitcoin’s price could reach over $132,000 during the year, fueled by the increasing money supply . Historical patterns also indicate that Bitcoin could absorb up to 10% of the new liquidity, which could potentially attract $2 trillion in investments as the global liquidity pool is predicted to expand by $20 trillion. Coutts did warn that Bitcoin cycles sometimes deviate from linear projections, leaving room for even higher price targets. Bitcoin’s rally has also been influenced by broader macroeconomic and political events. Donald Trump’s victory in the recent U.S. presidential election boosted risk appetite in financial markets, and created even more momentum for Bitcoin. Analysts from Bitfinex predict that the new administration's supportive regulatory stance could lead to new all-time highs for cryptocurrencies in 2025. Speculation about the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve under the Trump administration fueled this optimism even more. Blockstream CEO Adam Back suggested that such a move could drive Bitcoin’s price toward $1 million. On-chain MicroStrategy? Solv Protocol is set to launch what it describes as an ”on-chain MicroStrategy,” to transform Bitcoin from a passive store of value into an active asset in decentralized finance (DeFi). Co-founder Ryan Chow announced the initiative, and described it as a transparent and permissionless platform that is designed to strategically manage Bitcoin reserves. The goal is to preserve wealth while still generating yield and amplifying returns, though specifics on exactly how this will be achieved remain unclear. As a Bitcoin staking platform, Solv offers a variety of yield strategies across multiple blockchain networks, leveraging Bitcoin layer-2s like Babylon and CoreChain, and DeFi protocols like Jupiter and Ethena. Currently, the platform oversees more than $3 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to data from DefiLlama . This move draws inspiration from MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm that has become synonymous with large-scale Bitcoin investments. Since 2020, MicroStrategy pivoted toward Bitcoin accumulation under the leadership of Michael Saylor, and established itself as a de-facto Bitcoin hedge fund. The company’s shares soared by over 450% in 2024 alone thanks to its innovative approach to leveraging its balance sheet for Bitcoin acquisitions. MSTR Bitcoin holdings (Source: MSTR Tracker ) MicroStrategy’s strategy includes the concept of Bitcoin yield, which measures the ratio of BTC holdings to outstanding shares, effectively tying corporate performance to Bitcoin accumulation. The firm also plans to raise $42 billion through equity and debt as part of its ambitious “21/21 Plan,” aiming for a projected Bitcoin yield of 12.7% by 2025. Solv’s effort to replicate this model in DeFi could bridge traditional finance strategies and blockchain innovation. This could position Bitcoin as a much more dynamic and versatile asset in decentralized ecosystems.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-02 06:12:26

This impressive rally pushed XRP past USDT, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, currently trading around $2.42 , XRP has seen a remarkable 70% weekly rise and a massive 377% increase over the past month. But here’s what is driving the XRP price Up. Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Awaits NYDFS Approval One of the biggest contributors to XRP’s surge is the news surrounding Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Reports suggest that the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) might soon approve RLUSD, with Ripple planning a December 4 launch. If approved, this would allow Ripple to enter New York’s strict digital finance market, enhancing its position in the stablecoin ecosystem. Ripple aims to position RLUSD as a competitor to major stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC. Acting as a liquidity bridge within Ripple’s network, RLUSD would work alongside XRP to strengthen Ripple’s global payment offerings. Growing Optimism for an XRP ETF Another factor boosting XRP’s price is growing anticipation for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. With hopes for a more crypto-friendly environment under a potential Trump administration, major players like Bitwise Invest, 21Shares, and Canary Funds have already joined the race by filing for XRP-spot ETFs. WisdomTree recently submitted its application, further fueling excitement in the market. Ripple Wins & Gary Gensler Exit Ripple’s recent legal win against the SEC has also reignited investor confidence. The court’s decision that XRP is not a security in most cases has set a precedent for the entire crypto industry. Adding to this is the announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation, set for January 2025. His exit might impact Ripple’s ongoing legal challenges, potentially inclining the ruling in Ripple’s favor. XRP Price Forecast XRP is showing strong growth as the cryptocurrency market recovers. Its performance often moves with the overall market trend. If Ripple keeps building partnerships and wins more legal battles, XRP’s price could rise even higher. It might reach $3.00 to $5.00 in the coming months if more investors get interested. However, there’s also a chance of price drops. Bad news, like new SEC claims or a market downturn, could bring XRP’s price back to $1.50 to $2.00.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|USDT|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-02 06:19:03

According to a Nikkei Asia report , the exchange will shut down operations and sell all assets to SBI Group-owned trading company SBI VC Trade, with the sale expected to be completed by March 2025. A Dec. 2 statement released by SBI VC Trade confirms that the company has reached an agreement with the exchange and will acquire all Japan crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin set for liquidation. The specific date of transfer will be disclosed in an upcoming announcement. As a part of the acquisition, SBI VC Trade will expand its offering by introducing 14 cryptocurrency trading pairs currently available on DMM Bitcoin but not yet supported by SBI VC Trade. This expansion is planned to be completed before the transfer of customer accounts and assets, ensuring a seamless transition for the hacked exchange’s users. The developments are somewhat unexpected considering that DMM Bitcoin had initiated recovery efforts and promised to make all users whole after the May 30 incident. Over 4,500 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $308 million at the time, was drained from one of the exchange’s wallets, making it the second largest hack in Japan, following the $534 million Coincheck hack in 2018.

It was a part of the exchange’s plans to raise $320 million to pay back its customers. Meanwhile, in July, the attackers, suspected to be the notorious Lazarus Group, were seen laundering a portion of the stolen funds via Huione Guarantee, an online marketplace turned hub for illicit activities. Additionally, in August, another 500 BTC was moved to multiple wallets. So far, all efforts to recover the stolen assets have failed. DMM Bitcoin becomes the latest Asian exchange to wind down its operations in 2024. WazirX , an Indian-origin exchange, has halted its operations in July after a $235 million hack of its hot wallet. In October, it was revealed that over a dozen South Korean crypto exchanges had shut down in 2024 after failing to comply with local regulations. On Oct. 11, the Singapore-based Fairdesk exchange also cited regulatory challenges before announcing plans to shut down shop.

Is XRP ATH Imminent in December? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP news today highlights its price surge past $2, reaching its highest levels since 2018. This jump, bringing its market cap above $100 billion, comes after a prolonged period of stagnation due to Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC Now, it seems like XRP is reclaiming its place in the market, and there’s more exciting news on the horizon. In a video analysis by Altcoin Daily the analyst charts out the key factors behind this bullish rally. Let’s dive straight into the facts. Ripple’s Stablecoin Could Be a Game-Changer The main factor driving XRP’s rise is Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin , RLUSD. Ripple is close to getting regulatory approval to launch the stablecoin, which could happen as soon as December 4th. The company has been working to ensure it complies with U.S. regulations before going live. Once RLUSD gets the green light, it could have a big impact on XRP’s price. A recent report from Fox Business revealed that the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) could approve RLUSD soon. If this happens, Ripple’s software could be used more widely by traditional banks, which could adopt RLUSD for transactions. As more banks use Ripple’s software, the demand for XRP is likely to rise as well, benefiting the token. Ripple’s Growing Footprint in the Stablecoin Market RLUSD has the potential to make a huge impact on the $200 billion stablecoin market, which is currently led by Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). With Ripple already well-integrated into the financial system, the addition of a stablecoin could further boost XRP’s utility and adoption. The more RLUSD is used, the more XRP could be needed for transactions, creating a positive feedback loop that benefits both Ripple and XRP. Legal Battle with the SEC May Soon End Another factor that’s giving positive vibes is the Ripple vs SEC case coming to an end . SEC Chairman Gary Gensler recently announced he will step down in January , and many in the XRP community are hopeful that his departure could lead to a more favorable outcome for Ripple. Legal experts, including attorney Jeremy Hogan, suggest that the SEC may drop all non-fraud crypto cases, including Ripple’s, which could result in a settlement. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Marks a 6-Year High, Smashes $2.5-Here’s the XRP Price Prediction for 2025 After a 300% Rise , Positive Market Signals for XRP Looking at XRP’s technical indicators, there are bullish signs across short, medium, and long-term trends. The moving averages show positive crossovers, suggesting potential price strength. While volatility is moderate at 7.75%, the RSI is at 93.89, indicating neutral conditions. The MACD shows mild upward momentum, signaling positive pressure in the market. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.39. FAQs Is XRP a Good Investment? XRP could be a good investment due to the upcoming launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD and the potential end of its legal battle with the SEC, which may drive increased demand. However, its volatility and market risks should be carefully considered. Can Ripple reach 100 euros?

37123939,https://coinpaprika.com/news/how-politics-killed-facebook-s-libra-project,1733125022,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37123939.jpeg,How Politics Killed Facebook’s Libra Project,https://coinpaprika.com/news/how-politics-killed-facebook-s-libra-project,"David Marcus, the former leader of Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project, has shed light on the reasons behind the initiative’s failure, pointing to political opposition rather than legal or regulatory challenges. His comments reveal how intense political pressures and the debanking of supporting institutions ultimately dismantled Libra, later rebranded as Diem. Announced in 2019, Libra aimed to transform global payments with a stablecoin backed by a cutting-edge blockchain. Despite its potential and extensive efforts to address regulatory concerns, the project was met with immediate resistance. Marcus shared that political forces were the decisive factor, stating, “There was no legal or regulatory issue left for regulators to use against us. It was a 100% political kill , executed through intimidation of captive banks.” Marcus highlighted key events that led to the project's collapse. Initially postponed to address concerns, Libra faced unwavering political hostility. A major turning point came after a meeting between Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. According to Marcus, Yellen described supporting Libra as “political suicide.” This prompted the Federal Reserve to caution banks involved with the project. Banks reportedly received calls from the Fed's general counsel, warning, “We can’t stop you from launching, but we’re not comfortable with it.” These warnings effectively ended the initiative. Marcus also revealed that this political resistance had broader implications. Kathryn Haun, a former Libra board member, and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, supported his account. Winklevoss described how Federal regulators halted the project despite its near readiness, stating, “It was all politics, no legal basis .” Reflecting on this experience, Marcus emphasized the importance of decentralization in future financial systems. He argued that truly global monetary networks need to be built on neutral, tamper-proof systems like Bitcoin, saying, “If you want to build an open monetary network for the world—designed to move trillions daily and last for a century—it must be based on the most decentralized and neutral asset: Bitcoin .” Marcus’s revelations have reignited debates about political interference in innovation, particularly in the cryptocurrency sector.

His call comes in response to Operation Chokepoint 2.0, a global initiative aimed at disrupting the crypto industry through measures like debanking, audits, and fines. Hoskinson stressed that internal conflicts must end if the industry hopes to overcome these challenges and achieve mainstream acceptance. In a November 30 post on X (formerly Twitter), Hoskinson addressed his past criticisms of ecosystems such as Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana, urging reconciliation. He encouraged the Cardano community to let go of old grievances and embrace collaboration across all crypto ecosystems. “Let the comments and opinions of the past go and embrace a full reset of all ecosystems,” he wrote. Hoskinson acknowledged that many influencers from rival platforms have previously dismissed Cardano. However, he pointed out that attitudes are shifting, with more people recognizing its potential. He emphasized the need to abandon tribalism , which he sees as a major barrier to widespread adoption and long-term growth. Looking ahead to 2025, Hoskinson envisions a united crypto industry driving progress and expanding markets. He argued that the next two years represent a critical period for the industry to establish itself as a mainstream financial asset . “We have a window to make crypto mainstream and grow our markets to tens of trillions of dollars of value,” he said, urging the community to set aside divisions and seize emerging opportunities. Hoskinson’s comments come as the industry continues to grapple with the effects of Operation Chokepoint 2.0. This campaign, which uses aggressive tactics to isolate crypto businesses, has had a global impact , disrupting financial operations and causing significant harm. “Many businesses were harassed, fined, audited, and de-platformed,” he noted. By focusing on shared goals and building solidarity, Hoskinson believes the crypto industry can overcome external threats and achieve broader adoption. He called on the community to prioritize collaboration, arguing that only a united front can secure the industry's future and unlock its full potential.",,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|MARKET|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-02 07:41:37

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 07:42:00

Michael Saylor’s Bold Prediction,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-microsoft-buy-bitcoin-following-microstrategy-michael-saylors-bold-prediction/,"The post Will Microsoft Buy Bitcoin Following MicroStrategy? Michael Saylor’s Bold Prediction appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News MicroStrategy, with its impressive BTC holding of 386,700 BTC, worth $37,335,320,418, is currently the top public company in terms of Bitcoin holdings. Recent developments indicate that the company is now very keen to encourage other companies to adopt Bitcoin. Recently, in a sensational 3-minute presentation, MicroStrategy former CEO Michael Saylor explained why top companies like Microsoft can no longer ignore Bitcoin, and even advised the Redmond-based American multinational technology conglomerate to consider exploring MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy. Here is everything you should know about Saylor’s extraordinary presentation. Saylor About Superiority of Digital Assets Saylor initially explained how global wealth is distributed between assets that provide utility and others that provide capital. He also discussed in detail how risky it is to invest in traditional assets. Presenting digital capital as the best strategy to avoid the threat of risk, he stated that this class of capital is far superior to physical capital. Projecting the emergence of the digital capital sector as a revolutionary advance in the area of capital preservation, he mentioned investors’ growing interest, and its newly received political and economic backing. Bitcoin as the Future of Technology Highlighting Bitcoin as the greatest digital transformation of the 21st century, he described how it has outperformed MicroSoft over the last four years. In the last four years, Bitcoin has seen a growth of 402.005%, while MicroSoft has surged by just 96.71%. Pointing at the charts, like the annualised asset performance chart, showcasing the exceptional performance of Bitcoin over others, Saylor claimed that it is more sensible for MicroSoft to invest in the largest cryptocurrency than to pursue stocks and bonds. Risks of Bonds v.s. Bitcoin Emphasising the capability of Bitcoin to minimise the element of risk, and warning how bonds undermine liquidity, Saylor projected investing in BTC as the only method before MicroSoft to achieve exceptional success. Public and Political Support for Bitcoin Saylor mentioned the growing public support for the Bitcoin market. Highlighting Donald Trump’s recent statement advising investors not to sell Bitcoin, he noted the recent shifts in the political landscape in favour of BTC. Saylor’s Call to Action: Embrace Bitcoin Pointed out how Microsoft has amplified the risks for its shareholders by investing over $200B in the last five years, he explained why the company urgently needs an asset like Bitcoin with no counterparty risk. Advising MicroSoft to convert their cash flows, dividends, buybacks and debts into Bitcoin, Saylor explained how the company could add hundreds of dollars to its value and eliminate risk. Saylor even invited MicroSoft to go through MicrosStrategy’s open source Bitcoin investment model. Finally, MicroStrategy’s former CEO strongly advised MicroSoft to consider investing in Bitcoin, indirectly emphasising it as a move necessary for the general good of the world. In conclusion, Michael Saylor’s call to MicroSoft emphasises the immense potential of Bitcoin as a strategic digital asset.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-02 07:44:53

The BRICS bloc, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has been working on alternatives, including a new currency and the use of digital assets, to reduce reliance on the dollar. In a statement on Truth Social, Trump demanded that BRICS nations abandon these plans. He warned of severe consequences, including 100% tariffs on goods and restricted access to the U.S. market, if the bloc continued pursuing a rival currency. “The idea that the BRICS countries are trying to move away from the dollar while we stand by is over,” Trump stated. He insisted that the U.S. would not allow any attempts to weaken the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency. Trump’s stance aligns with his “America First” policy and campaign promises to protect the dollar’s global dominance. Reports indicate his team is already considering punitive actions against nations backing de-dollarization initiatives. His administration views the BRICS efforts as a threat to U.S. economic power, particularly as the bloc has expanded its membership and influence. The BRICS group has been pushing for alternatives to the dollar since 2023, exploring mechanisms like using local currencies, the Chinese yuan, and blockchain-based stablecoins for trade. These measures could help member nations bypass Western sanctions and reduce dependency on the U.S.-led financial system. At a recent summit, BRICS nations discussed ways to reshape international trade, including creating a new framework that avoids reliance on the dollar. The bloc also expanded its membership for the first time in over a decade, adding Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UAE , Ethiopia, and Egypt. With 34 other nations expressing interest in joining, BRICS aims to strengthen its economic influence and challenge the West’s dominance in global trade. Market analysts suggest that these alternative currencies could allow BRICS countries to avoid U.S. sanctions, offering more flexibility in global transactions. However, Trump’s aggressive response signals a possible escalation in economic tensions between the U.S. and BRICS nations. His administration is expected to take a tough approach to counter these moves, which could reshape the global financial landscape. Observers note that the U.S. and BRICS are on a collision course over the future of international trade. While the BRICS bloc seeks greater independence from the dollar, Trump’s hardline stance underscores the importance of protecting the U.S. economy and its role in global finance. With BRICS’ efforts gaining momentum, this conflict could define a new era of economic competition. Trump’s warning highlights the stakes for both sides as they navigate a rapidly changing global economy.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-02 07:45:34

Instead, Base is focused on supporting developers and solving practical challenges in the blockchain space. Jesse Pollak, Base's lead developer, reaffirmed this vision in a statement on November 30. He emphasized that the network’s goal is to create tools that empower developers and enhance decentralized application (dApp) innovation. Pollak highlighted Base’s commitment to being open-source and adhering to open standards and markets, ensuring the network remains accessible and creative. ""There are no plans for a Base network token. We are focused on building and solving real problems,"" he said. This announcement comes as Base continues to achieve remarkable milestones. On November 28, analytics platform Nansen reported that the network had processed 11.4 million transactions, a dramatic increase from the 263,000 it handled the previous year. Base also reached a record-breaking 132.50 daily transactions per second (TPS) on November 26, surpassing its earlier achievement of 106.86 TPS, according to L2beat. Base’s ecosystem has played a crucial role in its success. Popular gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, such as Uniswap and Aerodrome, have thrived on the network. Viral trends like Clanker and Virtuals Protocol memes have further driven user engagement. These factors have helped Base secure the second-highest Total Value Locked ( TVL ) among Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, reaching $12.54 billion, second only to Arbitrum. The network’s strong performance is also linked to its backing by Coinbase, a company valued at $73 billion. With Coinbase’s vast resources and user base, Base offers enhanced scalability and simplified interactions for dApp users. These advantages position Base as a leading competitor in the Ethereum Layer-2 market, outpacing networks like Optimism. By focusing on innovation without relying on token incentives, Base aims to solve real-world problems and continue its growth. Its success underscores the potential of blockchain networks to thrive by prioritizing developer support and practical applications. Base’s commitment to open standards and community-driven innovation ensures its place as a leader in the sector.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ARB,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-02 07:49:22

From the breakout on 9 November, Shiba Inu increased nearly 50% before topping out on 12th at the high of $0.00003. After the correction from the top, SHIB has failed to regain strength. However, it trades above the short-term moving averages of 10 and 20. While it has taken support from the 10-DMA several times, it has only touched 20 twice, which indicates that the coin still has strong buying power. According to technical analysis, Shiba Inu is trading inside the triangle pattern, which will work out as a bullish continuation pattern if it breaks out from the upper resistance. The breakout level of this triangle pattern coincides with the $0.000025 resistance level, which is the major level to watch in the next few days. The first target for the SHIB price is $0.00003, the recent swing high. The next target could be the March resistance level of $0.000032. If it breaks down, the major support levels are $0.000022 and $0.00002. Brett trades in bullish flag pattern In technical analysis comparison, Brett has shown stronger strength than Shiba Inu but lags behind Cutoshi. After the rally in early November, Brett has been trading in a bullish flag pattern. This flag pattern in Brett has a depth of 15% and a duration of 14 days. Currently, the price is near the breakout level. If buyers take control, the recent swing high might be taken out. Brett’s relative strength index is at 67, near the overbought zone, but it might go higher if the price breaks the near resistance levels. The MACD is showing mixed signals as the MA lines are flat. The change in direction of the MA lines will further decide the direction of Brett’s price. To learn more about the Cutoshi presale, visit the website.

Eros Biondini introduced a bill on Monday suggesting Brazil's central bank establish a strategic reserve called ResBit. The plan involves gradually purchasing bitcoin until it makes up 5% of Brazil’s national reserves , as reported by local sources. The initiative follows similar moves in the United States, where Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis is advocating for a national bitcoin reserve. Lummis, who previously proposed this idea during the Bitcoin 2024 conference, plans to reintroduce her bill now that Donald Trump is set to return to the White House. Her proposal suggests the U.S. Treasury acquire 1 million bitcoins over five years , to be held for at least 20 years. Lummis believes this approach could help address the national deficit and strengthen the economy. “It’s gaining momentum,” she told the Washington Examiner, emphasizing the need to rally support in Congress. Biondini’s bill highlights how countries like El Salvador and the U.S. are integrating cryptocurrencies into their financial systems. According to the proposal, investing in bitcoin would boost financial sovereignty and support economic growth in Brazil. Both Brazil’s and the U.S.’s plans share some common ground. They propose holding bitcoin in cold storage for security and require public reporting of transactions. However, while Lummis’s bill sets a 20-year holding period, Brazil’s proposal does not specify when the bitcoin could be sold.

U.S. asset managers have filed plans with regulators to launch Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds that use derivatives to eliminate or at least minimize potential losses in an effort to attract cautious investors seeking exposure to the crypto market with reduced risk. According to a Financial Times report on Monday, Dec. 2, the proposals include a range of “buffered” and “managed floor” strategies, which reduce risks by protecting investors from big losses but limit how much profit they can make. Calamos Investments, First Trust Portfolios, Innovator ETFs, and Grayscale Investments are among the firms seeking the green light from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the report reads. Each firm plans to offer products using buffered or managed floor strategies to protect against losses of up to 30%, while some also propose covered call ETFs or leveraged variations.

The filings follow a significant shift in the ETF market as Ethereum ( ETH ) spot ETFs recently recorded a $332.92 million single-day inflow, surpassing Bitcoin ETFs for the first time.

Speaking at a U.K. event hosted by Coinbase-backed advocacy group Stand With Crypto, Shirzad reportedly called the president the most pro-crypto leader in history. “We have the most pro-crypto Congress ever,” he said, referring to Republicans sweeping the House and Senate. With Trump and his allies running the show, Shirzad predicts the long-stalled crypto bills will finally gain traction. For the 50 million Americans holding crypto, this could be the moment their interests are taken seriously in Washington. “I think the combination should finally allow the 50 million Americans who own crypto to have their interests and voice heard in policy,” Shirzad added. Two key bills on the table Congress isn’t starting from scratch. Two major crypto bills are already in the pipeline, and they could reshape how digital assets are treated in the U.S. The first is the Republican-led Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. This one’s a big deal. It lays out the rules for how crypto will be regulated and managed, something the industry has been screaming for over the past decade. The bill has already passed the House, setting the stage for smoother progress when the new administration steps in. The second bill, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, targets stablecoins. Ideally, it would set up a licensing system for stablecoin issuers, creating a solid framework for these tokens, which are critical to the broader crypto ecosystem. But unlike its counterpart, this one hasn’t cleared the House yet. Shirzad is hopeful but realistic, admitting that the stablecoin bill might not see movement until Trump is fully seated well into 2025. Crypto’s political muscle and Gensler’s highly-anticipated departure Trump’s victory wasn’t just a win for him, it was a power move for the entire crypto industry. The numbers back it up. Crypto-related PACs raised over $245 million during the election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission data. That money funded campaigns, rallied support, and stacked Congress with nearly 300 pro-crypto lawmakers. Coinbase’s Stand With Crypto Alliance created a grading system to evaluate candidates based on their crypto stance. The result? A Congress that’s now ready to listen to the industry. Then there’s Gary Gensler, the SEC chair who’s been a thorn in crypto’s side for years. He’s out the door on January 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration. Gensler’s tenure was filled with aggressive crackdowns on crypto. Trump, though, has brought a new direction. Shirzad wouldn’t speculate on who Trump might pick to replace Gensler but said the president-elect has a knack for choosing people who align with his vision. “As long as he picks somebody who’s a change agent, it’ll be good for the U.S., good for society, good for the people that own crypto,” he noted.

According to local media outlet Money Today , Democratic Party floor leader Park Chan-dae announced at a press conference that the DP has agreed to the government’s plan to postpone the tax on crypto traders for another two years, pushing back the bill intended for 2025 to 2027. Park said that the government needs “more institutional preparation” before regulators can systematically begin to tax crypto traders. “After in-depth discussions on the postponement of taxation on virtual assets, I thought that now is the time for additional institutional overhaul,” said Park. The National Assembly will vote on Dec. 2, 2024 to decide the fate of South Korea’s crypto tax proposal, with both parties in agreement to postpone the tax. Initially, the DP had opposed the People’s Power Party’s plans to postpone the launch, insisting that the 20% tax on crypto traders must be launched in January 2025. In addition, the DP had also proposed raising the annual tax threshold from 2.5 million won ($1,781) to 50 million won ($35,633). But the government had rejected the main opposition party’s proposal, instead voting in favor of PPP’s motion to delay the crypto tax to 2027. You might also like: South Korean FSC dismiss plans to build Bitcoin reserve ‘for the time being’ Additionally, Park said that there is still room for negotiations regarding the 13 bills proposed by the government, which include the crypto tax bill, the inheritance bill and the gift tax bill among others. This means that the 20% tax on crypto traders earning a profit minimum of 2.5 million won is still subject to change. “If the government does not take any action, an even greater reduction is possible with the revised plan [which modifies the current reduction plan],” said Park. This marks the third time the South Korean government has decided to postpone the virtual asset tax bill. It was first introduced in December 2020 and scheduled for implementation as early as 2021, but then the bill was delayed to 2025. Now, it has a very strong chance of being postponed even further to 2027. The law would implement a 20% tax with an extra 2% local tax towards profits exceeding 2.5 million won or around $1,781. Several major crypto exchanges argued against the 2.5 million won threshold, saying that a 20% tax on the basic deduction would make trading volumes plummet.

The cryptocurrency has already gained 2% in the first days of the month, continuing its upward momentum.

As XRP recently hit a multi-year high of $1.9513, questions have arisen about whether its true market cap is being underreported due to how circulating supply is calculated. Morgan argues that XRP’s market cap should reflect the approximately 62 billion tokens not locked in escrow rather than the 57.8 billion tokens currently reported as its circulating supply by CoinMarketCap. There is less than 38 billion XRP left in escrow which means than when XRP reached $1.90 it’s market cap was almost $118 billion not $107 billion which is not being shown on @CoinMarketCap . If so it has already flipped Solana. pic.twitter.com/oKHLdDwuNY — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) November 30, 2024 Ripple’s XRP holdings recently dropped below 39% , and at $1.90 per token, Morgan claims the market cap should be closer to $118 billion, a significant increase from the $107 billion figure derived from the listed supply. In response to critics, Morgan clarified his methodology, “I am counting 62 billion not in escrow multiplied by $1.90. Do the math.” He dismissed the categorization of Ripple’s holdings outside escrow as “undistributed,” arguing that it is a subjective and arbitrary exclusion from the circulating supply. The debate has drawn mixed reactions. One user countered , “Your maths is off as the circulating supply excludes ‘escrow’ and ‘undistributed.’ The latter belongs to Ripple outside of escrow.” Others reiterated that escrow doesn’t get counted until it has entered the market. Morgan, however, remains firm in his position, emphasizing that his calculations do not include escrowed tokens. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Has XRP Surpassed Solana? This issue is particularly relevant given XRP’s recent performance. After being overtaken by Solana in late 2023, XRP’s resurgence to $1.94 has reignited competition between the two assets. Morgan shared a screenshot showing Solana’s market cap at $115 billion at the time of his post, but his recalculations suggest XRP may have already surpassed it. At the time of press, XRP is trading at $2.42, up over 30% in the past 24 hours. The digital asset has officially flipped Solana and Tether (USDT) to reclaim the third position after years of struggles and price suppressions. Many experts have predicted that XRP will surpass Ethereum in this cycle. However, Morgan’s post is important as it highlights a significant valuation issue in the market that could hamper digital assets.

However, when it comes to crypto trading, things haven’t been smooth sailing, and traders have had to deal with the impacts of a more complex and saturated crypto market. This has included volatility levels reaching all-time highs , trading fees going up, and liquidity being spread thin across exchanges. The good news is that with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), crypto traders and developers now have the ability to create powerful AI agents that provide a competitive edge . Amongst these is Monitok’s hybrid crypto exchange with an AI trading assistant, which goes beyond mere automation, and offers predictive analytics, personalized trade recommendations, and real-time risk management – to name a few features. Challenges That Modern Crypto Traders Face With crypto markets becoming increasingly saturated and unpredictable, traders are confronted with a host of new challenges, creating roadblocks that can be overwhelming without the right support or solution in place. Let’s dive into some of the most common challenges currently facing crypto traders. 1) Overwhelming amount of new tokens With thousands of crypto tokens launching across multiple blockchain networks, crypto traders face an increasingly difficult task—finding value amidst a flood of new assets. This oversaturation often leads to confusion and missed opportunities as traders struggle to evaluate each new project (due to a lack of time), and also increases the risk of falling into illiquid or low-performing assets. 2) Increased volatility Although volatility is often one of the reasons why crypto swing traders can make impressive gains, it’s also one of the most dangerous aspects of trading. This is because market conditions can change in seconds, and many traders often find themselves ill-equipped or unable to respond to sudden price swings in both a rapid and informed manner. 3) Liquidity fragmentation Another common frustration amongst crypto traders is an increase in liquidity fragmentation. With liquidity often spread thinly across various exchanges and platforms, trading conditions have suffered, and often result in slippage, delays, or poor pricing. This not only reduces efficiency but creates extra hurdles for those looking to execute large trades or capitalize on quick market shifts. 4) High transaction fees + network congestion Rising transaction fees and network congestion continue to be persistent issues in the crypto space. During busy periods, network slowdowns can cost traders valuable time and money, while high gas fees can take away from profits. So without efficient management, these issues can become costly; and for even the most skilled of traders. 5) AI-driven competition As AI crypto bots become more omnipresent and readily available, it’s starting to create a divide between those who use them, and those who don’t. AI trading bots are often outpacing the manual data collection and analyses of most crypto traders, and also offer superior evaluation of crypto asset performance. AI does this by being able to collect, track and interpret the “right” data correctly, helping to foresee the impact of macro events to markets, and knowing when to take profit; helping traders to manage emotions and greed. This gives those who embrace AI a distinct advantage. AI Technology in Modern Crypto Trading Given the challenges seen above, it’s not surprising how more and more developers are seeking to leverage AI to enhance crypto trading. Below are some examples of how AI is revolutionizing crypto trading. How AI is revolutionizing crypto trading Firstly, AI has the ability to detect patterns in large datasets and provides traders with insights that would otherwise be missed. More specifically, AI-powered tools can identify correlations between market events, price movements, and trading volume that are nearly impossible for humans to spot. This enables traders to refine their strategies with next-level precision. Another very impressive (and useful) feature of AI for crypto trading is its ability to process vast amounts of quantitative data and in real-time. So instead of having to spend ages manually analyzing order books, technical indicators, and market sentiment, AI allows traders to do this far quicker, and more efficiently. This in turn allows traders to rapidly respond to market shifts during periods of high volatility. AI-powered bots also have the ability to automate the trading process in ways that can greatly enhance efficiency. Executing trades faster than humans ever could, allows traders to act on opportunities the moment they arise. But perhaps the most appealing utility is AI’s predictive models, which attempt to forecast price movements by analyzing historical data and current trends, and at times yields surprisingly accurate predictions. Although not foolproof, these AI models can be very useful for managing risks, and gauging potential market shifts. How Monitok’s AI Assistant Simplifies Decision-making To bring additional value to users, Monitok’s revolutionary hybrid crypto exchange will be incorporating a cutting-edge AI assistant to help simplify (and enhance) the decision-making process based on users’ profiles and market trends. Below there are some of the core features of the new AI assistant, and how they will each bring value to Monitok users. Predictive analytics for trading Monitok’s AI assistant includes predictive analytics and will process real-time data and historical trends to help traders identify patterns, and anticipate market movements with greater accuracy. This is a process that usually takes human hours to conduct manually. Personalized AI trade recommendations Monitok’s AI assistant is more than a one-size-fits-all solution and offers personalized trade recommendations by analyzing users’ trading habits, risk tolerance, and market conditions. This is designed to optimize profits whilst simultaneously saving users time. Automated trade selection To further simplify the trading process, Monitok’s AI assistant automates trade selection, executing transactions at the most opportune moments. This reduces the burden on traders to constantly monitor the market and react to rapid price fluctuations. Gauging social sentiment By collecting on-chain data, and scraping data from crypto social media and news outlets, the AI assistant iwill then feed them through an LLMs to provide a holistic social sentiment on various markets, tokens and projects. Real-time risk management Last but not least, Monitok’s AI assistant offers real-time risk management, meaning it continuously monitors market conditions and adjusts strategies to mitigate potential losses. This feature is particularly useful during market downturns. Why Monitok’s Users Should be Excited While there are a few AI trading bots in the crypto industry, most fail to address the full spectrum of challenges traders face. Monitok, however, will offer something far more well-rounded with its AI trading assistant (set to be released in Q3, 2025) and revolutionary hybrid exchange, which already solves key issues such as a lack of security, complex user experience, and fragmented liquidity. Therefore, the future addition of an AI assistant is the cherry on the cake, as providing features like personalized trade recommendations, predictive analytics, and automated trade selection will work in perfect harmony with Monitok’s hybrid infrastructure; giving traders more control, precision and speed. A match made in heaven if you will. It’s important to note that staking $MONY will unlock various AI features, and will give users the ability to personalize their own apps. For this reason, Monitok’s ongoing $MONY Airdrop Rain Season, and upcoming token launch will provide users with a great opportunity to accumulate enough $MONY to start experimenting with the platform’s AI. In the meantime, the Monitok team will continue to work diligently on the platform’s AI features and recommends that all interested users follow the project on its Twitter page to keep up to date with the latest developments.",AI and Tech,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-02 08:00:23
37124655,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656242,1733126445,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Crypto Analyst Says Litecoin Is About To Pull An XRP, Here’s What He Means",https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/ltc/litecoin-about-to-pull-an-xrp/,"Crypto analyst Tony Severino said Litecoin is about to pull an XRP, suggesting that the coin could soon enjoy a parabolic rally. The analyst alluded to a bullish indicator on LTC’s chart, which showed that the crypto could witness this parabolic rally. Litecoin Is About To Pull An XRP, Here’s Why In an X post, Tony Severino said that Litecoin is about to pull an XRP, noting that the crypto is now above the monthly upper Bollinger Band . This suggests that LTC has undergone the necessary price correction and is now well-primed for a bullish reversal. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that a wick to the upside was already forming for the crypto on the monthly chart. Severino didn’t give a price target for how high Litecoin could rally when this move to the upside occurs. However, the chart showed that the $150 and $300 price levels were in view, a rally that could ultimately pave the way for LTC to rally to its current all-time high (ATH) of $412. It is worth mentioning that the crypto analyst had also recently made a similar analysis for XRP. Before now, Severino mentioned XRP is just above the monthly upper Bollinger Band just as BB Width expands from the tightest squeeze in XRP history. He added that this is going to shock and awe. Since then, XRP has enjoyed a parabolic rally of over 200% and is now above the $2 mark, a level the analyst’s chart showed the crypto could surpass. Therefore, this Litecoin analysis is undoubtedly one to watch since the crypto analyst predicts that LTC will pull an XRP. Litecoin has yet to enjoy its bull run, although it already looks to be catching up, considering it is up over 24% in the last seven days. The Next Dino Coin To Run? Like Severino, crypto analyst Crypto Snorlax has also suggested that Litecoin will be the next ‘ Dino coin ’ to witness a parabolic rally. In an X post , the analyst highlighted a chart overlaying XRP’s price action over LTC’s. Based on this analysis, Crypto Snorlax revealed two interesting findings. Firstly, he noted that there is a strong correlation between old altcoins. With XRP recording a 5x price increase from its bottom range, the analyst expects Litecoin to follow shortly. Secondly, Crypto Snorlax revealed that Litecoin just broke above $115, an 18-month resistance. Therefore, Litecoin is well primed for a significant rally, having flipped this resistance to support. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that LTC could enjoy up to a 3x price increase and reach as high as $450, which would mark a new ATH for the crypto. At the time of writing, Litecoin is trading at around $121, up over 20% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",LTC|XRP|analyst|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news|Litecoin|Litecoin news|litecoin price|ltc|LTC news|ltc price|ltc/usd|LTCUSDT|Ripple|ripple news|xrp|xrp news|XRP Price|XRPUSD|xrpusdt,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|LTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-02 08:00:45

In a post on social media platform X, the longtime Bitcoin bull says that those who save their money in fiat currencies will be left behind by those who save in BTC and precious metals. Kiyosaki says that after a certain point, the poor and the middle class will have missed their chance to get into BTC at a reasonable price, cementing their place on the wealth ladder. “THE RICH WILL GET RICHER: Q: WHO WILL BE RICHER? A: The people who save Gold, Silver. Bitcoin. I own all three financial assets. Q: WHO WILL BE POORER? A: The people who save dollars, Pesos, Yen, Euro, & Loonies. As I warned in Rich Dad Poor Dad ‘Savers are losers…because cash is trash.’ Bitcoin will soon break $100,000. Once Bitcoin passes $100,000, it will be almost impossible for the poor and middle class to catch up. The horse will be out of the barn and running. WHY? Once Bitcoin breaks $100,000, ONLY the ultra-rich such as corporations, banks, and sovereign wealth funds will be able to afford Bitcoin of any consequence. FOMO (fear of missing out) is good. Don’t be left behind. Don’t let the rich get richer…without You. Take care.” Last month, Kiyosaki said that his goal was to own 100 BTC, regardless of price. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $97,567.

We can see that CryptoBox combines simplicity, security, and profitability, making it the premier choice for staking in 2025. Binance – Big Ecosystem, Lower Rewards Binance, one of the largest crypto exchange, also offers staking with a wide range of assets. Users benefit from its brand reputation and ease of use with trading. But Binance’s staking rewards are lower than CryptoBox and it does not have advanced AI-driven insights to maximize earnings. Features: Wide selection of staking coins Reputable exchange with high volume Fixed and flexible staking options While Binance is a big name, CryptoBox’s AI and bonuses make it to have a better staking experience. Kraken – Trusted Platform, Limited Staking Options Kraken is another big player in the crypto space, offering staking for popular assets like Ethereum, Polkadot, and Solana. The platform is user-friendly for beginners but has limited staking options compared to CryptoBox’s 100+ assets. Features: High security and transparency Daily staking rewards for select assets Easy onboarding process While Kraken is reliable, CryptoBox has more assets and higher returns for serious investors. Stakewise – Liquid Staking With Fewer Perks Stakewise specializes in liquid staking, users can unlock staked funds for trading or other purposes. While this is useful, Stakewise doesn’t have CryptoBox’s AI-driven tools and bonuses like a free $100 sign up bonus and lifetime referral commissions. Features: Liquid staking for Ethereum Decentralized platform with a focus on transparency Lower fees for staking services CryptoBox’s seamless integration of liquid staking with AI and its lucrative cashback rewards make it the better option for maximizing returns. Lido Finance – Leading Ethereum Staking Platform Lido Finance is the biggest Ethereum staking platform where users can earn rewards while having liquidity. Its popularity is mainly due to its simplicity and decentralized model. But it does not have multi-asset support and bonuses like CryptoBox’s Million Bounty Program which makes it less appealing. Features: Liquid staking for Ethereum and a few other assets Decentralized governance model Competitive staking rates Lido is good for Ethereum-focused investors, whereas CryptoBox is good for investors with 100+ assets and custom plans. Coinbase – Beginner Friendly, High Fees Coinbase offers staking as part of its exchange, convenient for new users. But the fees are high, cutting into potential profits. In contrast, CryptoBox ensures users keep more of their earnings and has AI-driven staking strategies for better results. Features: Big exchange with easy-to-use app Educational resources for beginners Limited staking options with high fees For those who want to earn more with less effort, CryptoBox delivers better value with a free staking plan and higher daily rewards which you get to keep. Conclusion Staking continues to offer an excellent pathway for earning passive income in the crypto world.

Coinbase ‘s top policy executive expects U.S. cryptocurrency regulations to move quickly once Donald Trump assumes the presidency in January 2025. In an interview with CNBC on Dec. 2, Coinbase’s chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad said that crypto legislation will likely progress “fairly quickly” through Congress after Trump takes office, pointing to the Republican president-elect’s strong pro-crypto stance and the party’s recent control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. “We have the most pro-crypto Congress ever and an extraordinarily pro-crypto president. This combination should allow the 50 million Americans who own crypto to have their interests heard in policy.” Faryar Shirzad You might also like: Trump in considerations for CFTC to regulate crypto CNBC notes that Shirzad’s comments coincide with two significant pieces of crypto-related legislation advancing through Congress: the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act and the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act. The first aims to establish a legal framework for cryptocurrencies and passed the House earlier this year, while the second seeks to regulate stablecoin issuers but has not yet been approved by the House. Shirzad expressed optimism that the bills will pass, though he acknowledged the chance of consideration in the current “lame duck” session is low. He expects major progress on both the market structure and stablecoin bills in 2025.

Besides, the top two cryptos, Bitcoin & Ethereum, continue to juggle within a narrow range, probably due to a massive liquidity shift into the other tokens. One among them is Dogecoin, which showed huge strength in the past few days and is currently preparing for another bullish wave. DOGE price broke the multi-year consolidation that held the levels largely below $0.15 and launched a 350% jump to mark the yearly highs at $0.48. Although the bulls seem to have halted a bit, they continue to maintain an ascending range, which suggests the top memecoin is preparing for the next bullish wave. With this, will the DOGE price reach $1 in 2025? The long-term price action suggests the bulls are strengthening their position to trigger a 500% rise over the next few months. The price remains consolidated within a rising parallel channel, and the recent rise from the pattern could push the price towards the resistance. Besides, the RSI entered the overbought zone and turned flat. However, the possibility of a continued upswing remains elevated as long as RSI trades within the bullish range, with the target at $0.7 for 2024 and over $11 in 2025. Besides, in the short term, the DOGE price is trading within a bull flag by maintaining a sustained rise within a pennant. With this, the price is expected to revamp a rise beyond $0.5, which may place the token at the edge of a massive explosion. A breakout from the range may trigger a 100% rise to mark $1, probably before the end of 2024 or in the first few days of 2025. On the other hand, memecoins like SHIB, PEPE, FLOKI, etc. have been ranging within a rising pattern, and hence, after a breakout, the price could trigger a huge upswing, forming new highs.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-02 08:05:48

The Trump administration has promised a tone of goodies for the cryptocurrency industry due to the overwhelming support during last month’s election. Already, institutional investors’ confidence in the cryptocurrency industry has significantly surged in the recent past. Furthermore, the overall crypto cash inflow, as observed by the US spot BTC and Ether ETFs, has increased the ongoing bullish outlook. The Ex Parte Garland Playbook As the United States undergoes a crucial transition to welcome the Trump administration, the difference with the Democrats has been exacerbated by today’s President Biden’s pardon for his son, Hunter Biden. Furthermore, President Biden pardoned Hunter not only for the gun and tax convictions but also for any crime he might have committed in the last decade. As a result, Hunter is immune from any potential investigation by the Trump administration. Consequently, the crypto community has been pushing the upcoming Trump administration to exercise its powers to pardon unfair treatment of Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ).

The movements on charts are spreading excitement among the Shib Army. At the end of October 2021, as the crypto market was about to take a dip, the dog-themed meme coin started its downward journey. From a peak of $0.00008854, it touched the bottom at $0.00000543 in June 2023. What are the symptoms that point towards an uprising? Let’s discuss. Historical Price Patterns of Shiba Inu Before we dive into the current conditions, let’s have a look at the past. As Niccolò Machiavelli said, “Whoever wishes to foresee the future must consult the past.” Since June 2022, SHIB has been moving mostly in a confined zone between $0.00000731 and $0.00001320. The memecoin finally broke out of this range in February 2024. The price has been following the support and resistance levels indicated by the Fibonacci retracement perfectly. In the last week of February 2024, SHIB surged by 371.98% to reach $0.00003564, however, it could not hold this position for long. Facing rejection from the 0.618 level of Fib at $0.00003429, the token started another down movement. From March to November 2024, Shiba Inu moved in a symmetrical triangle only to receive an upside breakout during the US election. Current Technical Analysis and Key Levels Currently, on a daily chart, we can see the movement is perfectly aligning with Fib levels, and the current support is at $0.00002553, with an ongoing resistance at $0.00003429. The RSI looks solid at 67.40, giving huge space for the price rise, and ADX at 41.94 supports the move. However, if we talk about the balance of power, it is currently at -0.55, which means bulls are taking a break before pushing the price further up. The 200 moving average has been crossed over by 20, 50, and 100 MA, and the 20 daily moving average lies exactly at the 0.5 support level of Fib. This shows that this is a very solid support zone now, and as the whole crypto market is in bullish sentiment, there are next to zero chances that this will be broken. The token is witnessing a 37.16% surge in the daily trading volume, which is at $6.11 billion at the time of writing. Investor Sentiments and On-Chain Metrics According to data by IntoTheBloc, 74% of Shiba investors are in profit at the current price of $0.00002950. Seven percent of investors bought at the current price range, leaving 19% in the loss. Since the launch of the Shiba Inu blockchain Shibarium, the total value locked in it is on the rise, with a few small bumps. Currently, the TVL is $5.57M. It was in decline from March 2024 till November, then it gained a huge spike. Approximately 41.07% of the total supply has been burned, supporting the rise of price. Shiba Inu Ecosystem: Expanding Horizons There are a number of projects that are built on Shiba Inu, which are contributing to its mass adoption and transactions. With every transaction, some amount of the fee is burned. These projects include a decentralized exchange called ShibaSwap, a collectible card game named Shiba Eternity, Shiboshis (a collection of 10,000 NFTs), and ShibaSwag. The SHIB ecosystem has other currencies like Leash and Bone. A new project, “Treat,” is coming to the ecosystem soon. There are many other projects on their way to support the Shiba Inu ecosystem. The bullish market sentiment and strong support levels suggests that the memecoin is on the path of rising.",Price Analysis|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-02 09:11:17

At 4 am UTC on Dec. 1, an attacker manipulated Clipper’s withdrawal function, exploiting its ability to process bundled swap and withdrawal transactions, the protocol wrote in its first post-incident report. The lost funds from liquidity pools on Optimism and Base accounted for roughly 6% of the total value locked in the platform, compelling it to suspend swaps and deposits on all chains and disable the ability to withdraw in the form of just one token. “Withdrawals are still available because Clipper is noncustodial and can never prevent you from withdrawing. However, any withdrawals must be in the mix of all assets in the pool,” Clipper Dex wrote. An initial investigation from Chaofan Shou, co-founder of security firm Fuzzland, suggested that the exploit stemmed from a private key leak, enabling the attacker to sign deposit and withdrawal requests to extract funds. However, Clipper has debunked these claims, stressing that its security architecture is designed to prevent such vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, Clipper reassured its community that all remaining funds are secure, promising regular updates as it continues its investigation. The team is also actively tracing the stolen assets and has invited the attacker to engage in dialogue.

Here are some of the possible reasons behind this mindblowing rally that made Ripple’s token the third-largest earlier today. Whale Accumulation It’s safe to say that Ripple’s native cross-border token has stolen the show after the US presidential elections. Despite its sluggish start, XRP went on a roll that pushed its price from about $0.6 to $2.5 earlier today, which became its highest level since January 2018. Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of the company behind the asset, explained earlier that US-based crypto companies have benefited the most from Trump’s victory due to the Democrats’ hostile stance against the industry. This theory has only been proven right since then, with XRP charting nothing but impressive gains. Within this past month or so, whales have been particularly active in accumulating the token. Their cumulative stash tapped a 6-year high recently amid reports that they have been buying from retail investors who rushed to secure profits. More recent data from Santiment revealed that large XRP wallets holding between 1M and 10M had purchased over 679 million coins in just three weeks. Additionally, non-empty addresses have gone above 5.5 million for the first time ever. Both of these are highly bullish factors for the underlying asset. XRP has skyrocketed to an astounding $2.49 market value for the first time since January 8, 2018. The 6-year (nearly 7-year) high comes as wallets with 1M-10M XRP have accumulated 679.1M tokens (currently worth $1.66B) in just 3 weeks. Also, total non-empty XRP wallets have… pic.twitter.com/bIsfOqdCQX — Santiment (@santimentfeed) December 2, 2024 Upcoming Stablecoin Launch Amid its four-year-long legal tussle against the US SEC, Ripple announced plans earlier this year to launch a stablecoin, which will be pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. This upcoming entrance in the multi-billion dollar stablecoin industry depends on the regulatory landscape in the US, which is expected to change a lot under Trump’s administration. According to FoxBusiness, the watchdog responsible for approving or rejecting the RLUSD applications – the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), has “indicated to Ripple it will approve the product” soon. In fact, the company is reportedly planning to launch it as early as December 4. The growing hype around the potential release of the product comes as the second potential reason behind XRP’s surge. Regulatory Change The third reason has been mentioned quite a lot since November 5 – the upcoming regulatory changes in the US, but cannot be overstated due to its significance. After all, Ripple and many other crypto companies were in the crosshairs of the SEC and other US watchdogs for years during Biden’s reign. With Trump making so many pro-crypto promises during his campaign and Gary Gensler already announcing his departure from the agency on January 20, the hype is real when it comes down to a more favorable environment for crypto businesses to thrive in the world’s largest economy. More than $1.3 billion entered the crypto markets since the elections, and XRP, which many believed was suppressed during Gensler’s time at the SEC, is finally breaking out.

China ‘s central bank digital currency — also known as the digital yuan — is still encountering “bottlenecks” in user adoption, driven by reluctance and competition from platforms like Alipay, says Charles Chang, director of the Fintech Research Centre at Fudan University in Shanghai. Despite the digital yuan’s potential, popular online payment services such as Alipay and WeChat Pay have entrenched user bases, making it difficult to persuade consumers to switch to a new option, Chang told the South China Morning Post in a Dec. 1 interview .

As of June, the cumulative transaction value of the digital yuan had reached 7 trillion yuan (around $968 billion), a significant increase from the previous year.

This development, which will distribute portions of the Wise Monkey (MONKY) supply, is part of a collaborative effort involving Floki, the Ape Accelerator, and other notable blockchain entities to introduce new energy to the crypto ecosystem. According to Binance’s announcement , the airdrop will use wallet snapshots to determine eligibility. For holders of ApeCoin ( APE ), the snapshot occurred on Nov. 29 at 00:00 UTC. Meanwhile, Floki ( FLOKI ) holders will have their snapshot on Dec. 15, at 00:00 UTC. Binance confirmed that the distribution will follow a specific ratio. Particularly, for every 1 FLOKI held, a market participant will receive 0.35 MONKY, while each 1 APE token will equal 804,828 MONKY. To qualify for the airdrop, users must hold at least 1 FLOKI or 1 APE. Any balances below this threshold, including those in trade, withdrawals or deposits at the time of the snapshot, are excluded.

However, liabilities in margin accounts and borrowed tokens are ineligible. Wise Monkey airdrop The Wise Monkey token gets its inspiration from the proverb “See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil.” The meme coin will launch on the Binance Smart Chain later this month. FLOKI and APE holders stand to receive portions of the supply. The project plans to allocate 35% of the supply to the Floki community, with 27% set to be airdropped to holdings on supported centralized exchanges and on-chain holdings. Meanwhile, 10% of the supply will go to APE holders. Binance’s recent support comes on the back of a similar move from OKX, Uphold and KuCoin. While the MONKY token distribution is confirmed, its listing on Binance for trading is subject to the platform’s rigorous review process, and no guarantees have been made.

Listing these as Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Hedera (HBAR), Yusko said that he invested in SOL due to the insistence of his team and became quite fond of it. “I have to admit that I really like Solana because they do it very well. And luckily we didn't sell the Solana at $13, and it went up to $240.” Mark Yusko also concluded his remarks by talking about DOGE and said that not owning the best memecoin Dogecoin is like betting against Elon Musk and that it is not a good idea, and that it is necessary to have at least a little DOGE. The famous CEO finally said that ADA, XRP and HBAR should also be invested in, even though he thinks they are risky.

Crypto Analyst Warns Of Sudden Sell Signal,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-boom-over-crypto-analyst-sudden-sell-signal/,"After staging a massive rally, the Dogecoin price is currently in a consolidation phase. And this is also reflected in the technical indicators. Crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) is warning of a potential sell indicator. In his latest update on X, Kevin shared a weekly DOGE/USDT chart and outlined technical signs that traders should monitor closely. Dogecoin Price Analysis Kevin highlighted that Dogecoin is “printing a sell signal on the weekly time frame with the red dot appearing,” cautioning that this signal requires confirmation over the next week to solidify its validity. He identified a convergence of three strong technical indicators, including a declining Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and a Stochastic Relative Strength Index (Stoch RSI) that has “topped out waiting for a bear cross.” These indicators collectively suggest that a potential downside may be imminent. However, Kevin balanced this with the observation that “price action still looks bullish and money flow is also bullish,” indicating that these factors currently outweigh the bearish signals. Despite the long-term sell signals, Kevin remains open to the possibility of continued bullish momentum in the short term. He noted that Dogecoin has “close[d] its highest monthly candle body close of all time,” marking a significant milestone while acknowledging that “downside is still a risk.” Looking ahead, Kevin pointed to the importance of a key resistance level, stating, “Until we break $0.60 cents cleanly then there’s nothing to really be excited about,” in reference to his weekly chart that includes Fibonacci price levels extending to $1. Moreover, Kevin is closely looking at macroeconomic factors that could influence Dogecoin’s performance. He indicated that an “ altcoin season ” could serve as a catalyst for DOGE’s continued strength, contingent upon Bitcoin’s dominance falling below the 55% level. “If BTC Dominance breaks the 55% level cleanly you will get your #ALTSEASON folks,” he explained. Additionally, Kevin shared his strategy regarding long-term moving averages, stating, “When these two long term moving averages cross on Dogecoin I will be selling a large piece of my bag. They have called the top successfully on DOGE multiple times. They are moving up fast!” Notably, the crypto analyst is referring to the Pi Cycle Top Indicator for Dogecoin, a tool traditionally used for Bitcoin (BTC). This indicator relies on the crossing of two moving averages—the 111-day and the 350-day multiplied by two—to signal potential market peaks. Last week, Kevin revealed, “One of my secret indicators for Dogecoin that is traditionally only supposed to work for BTC is the Pi Cycle tops indicator. It has accurately called every DOGE cycle top and bottom over each of its cycles. When the two moving averages cross along with Monthly RSI being at a certain level that’s when I plan on taking significant portions out of the market.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.41.",Dogecoin|doge|DOGE news|Doge price|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|Dogecoin price analysis|dogecoin technical analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-02 09:30:24

To be more specific, the veterans are back as the primitive tokens like XRP, AVAX, LTC, ALGO, HBAR, etc. and many more with experience of the 2021 bull run and gaining more attention. It happened soon after the Bitcoin price entered relaxing mode after an attempt to breach the much-awaited target of $100K. The most important reason behind the sluggish behaviour is the drop in volume from the highs above $150 billion to the current levels below $50 billion. This shift in the volume to other altcoins could have weakened the rally, which again faced a failed attempt to reach $100K and dropped below $95,000. What’s next? What’s the Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction for December 2024? As the Bitcoin price struggles, the fear and greed index just dropped below 80, suggesting the trader’s sentiments have just shifted from extreme greed to greed. However, the downfall does not appear to have reached its destiny yet, as more longs await to liquidate soon. The liquidation heatmap from Coinglass suggests the price faced a long liquidation barrier between $98,065 and $98,257 where nearly $500 million in longs were liquidated. Although the shorts placed at $96,336 offered a small rebound, it was not enough to keep up the rally, which fell weak at $97,000. As a result, the price is juggling in and out of $95,300, which has over $130 million in accumulated liquidity. So what’s next? Considering the heatmap, the next possible level to look at is $95,657, which could break the bearish narrative; else, $94,500, which may weaken the bulls even more. However, considering the current trade set, a rebound appears to be fast approaching. The short-term price action suggests the token broke out of the rising parallel channel intending to reach the $100 milestone. Unfortunately, it attracted an 8.38% pullback, which further activated the bulls. Presently, the BTC price is testing the lower support of the channel, but this may certainly not be treated as the start of a bearish cycle. Previously, when the bulls failed to hold $92,500, a drop close to $90,000. initiated a strong rebound. Hence, if the price fails to hold the support, a small bearish pullback to $94,500 could attract huge liquidity, reviving a rise to levels above $98,000. The stochastic RSI, which has dropped to the oversold range, is preparing for a rebound. With this, the bullish momentum could be re-instigated, reviving a rise back to $98,000, which has become more rigid, and a breakout with massive buying pressure could lead the rally to $100K. Until then, the Bitcoin (BTC) price could continue to juggle below the milestone while defending the support first at $95,500 and later at $91,500.",Price Analysis|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ALGO|ALTCOIN|AVAX|BTC|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-02 09:35:07

This drop, highlighted by a clear downside breakout from a rising wedge pattern, signals the official start of Altseason 2024-25. While Bitcoin struggles to hit the $100,000 milestone despite weeks of strong upward momentum, the focus is now shifted to altcoins. Bitcoin Dominance Falls Below 57% Prominent crypto trader Captain Faibik has confirmed that Altseason 2024-25 has officially begun.

If the trend line breaks, chart analysis suggests that Bitcoin’s dominance could drop back to around 50%, highlighting the growing focus on altcoins. Altcoin Season Index Hits 78 Along with the Bitcoin dominance breakdown, the Altcoin Season Index has surged to 78 , surpassing the critical level of 75%. Captain Faibik points out that when the index goes above 75%, it shows that the top 50 cryptocurrencies have been performing better than Bitcoin over the past 90 days. This is a clear sign that altcoins are currently outpacing Bitcoin. However, coins like XRP have surged an impressive 360% in the last 30 days. Solana recently reached new record highs, touching the $260 mark. Cardano has risen over 208% in the same period, and Ethereum is now aiming to retest the $4,000 level. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin, ETH, & XRP Price Prediction: Here’s What to Expect in December 2024! , Opportunities for Altcoin Traders Faibik believes this is a great time for traders to focus on altcoins.

Eligible users will receive MONKY tokens directly in their wallets, calculated based on token holdings. This latest Binance news highlights the platform’s commitment to rewarding its user base while supporting emerging projects. With tailored distribution ratios, the MONKY airdrop promises added value for FLOKI and APE holders across the whole ecosystem. Binance Confirms MONKY Airdrop for FLOKI and APE Holders Binance has announced a significant update for FLOKI and ApeCoin (APE) holders, confirming its support for the Wise Monkey (MONKY) airdrop. With clear eligibility criteria and attractive distribution ratios, the event emphasizes its focus on delivering value and creating opportunities for its users. According to the update, FLOKI holders will receive 0.35 MONKY for every FLOKI token, while APE holders are set to gain 804,828 MONKY per token. To qualify, users must hold at least 1 FLOKI or 1 APE in Binance wallets such as Spot, Funding, and Margin accounts. The snapshot for APE will take place on November 29, and for FLOKI, it will occur on December 15. Deposits or withdrawals in progress during the snapshot will not count, ensuring only active balances are considered. This airdrop could generate increased attention toward FLOKI and APE, potentially boosting their trading activity. FLOKI, a prominent top meme coin , continues to attract retail investors, while APE holds a strong position in the NFT ecosystem, offering long-term appeal. Binance’s involvement adds credibility and excitement to the distribution process. While Binance, one of the top crypto exchanges , will manage the MONKY airdrop, the token’s listing on the platform is not guaranteed. Its inclusion will depend on whether MONKY successfully passes Binance’s rigorous review process. This reinforces Binance’s commitment to providing transparent and user-focused initiatives that support the broader crypto community. FLOKI and APE Prices: Recent Trends and Market Performance FLOKI price traded at $0.0002273, down nearly 5% during writing. The meme coin saw a 24-hour high of $0.0002489, indicating the highly volatile scenario in the market. The token is down by 6% over the past week but has surged 70% in the last month. This rise is largely due to its recent Coinbase listing . With a market cap of $2.2 billion and a 24-hour trading volume of $701 million, FLOKI remains a strong player in the meme token market. On the other hand, ApeCoin (APE) price was $1.50, down 2% from yesterday. Its 24-hour low and high range from $1.46 to $1.62. APE benefits from its connection to the Bored Ape Yacht Club. It has a market cap of $1.14 billion and a $367 million trading volume. Both FLOKI and APE remain in the top 100 coins by market cap, showing their strong presence in the crypto space. In addition, FLOKI and APE both continue to show strong performance. Besides, the recent Binance update is also expected to provide an additional boost to the tokens. For example, when THENA was listed on Binance , it experienced a massive 500% price jump. This trend highlights the influence Binance’s listing can have on a token’s market value, potentially providing additional momentum for coins like FLOKI and APE.

This adverse move came amid reports that large bitcoin whales have deposited significant amounts of the asset to Binance, potentially to realize some profits. However, there’s some good news as well. Whales Selling? Large crypto investors, known as whales, are fundamental to the underlying assets’ price movements due to their ability to purchase or offload substantial amounts in a short time. As such, several on-chain analytics platforms are observing many of their actions to possibly predict a notable price movement in either direction depending on whether they buy or sell. Lookonchain outlined a recent worrying move from a ‘giant’ whale that had accumulated 11,657 BTC (valued at over $780 million) from March 14 until October 31 at an average price of $66,953. With the cryptocurrency skyrocketing by about 50% from their average entry price, the anonymous whale deposited 1,000 BTC to Binance earlier today, potentially with the intention of selling and realizing some profits. A giant whale deposited 1000 $BTC ($97.5M) to #Binance in the past 4 hours! This whale has accumulated 11,657 $BTC ($780.5M) from #Binance between Mar 14 and Oct 31 at an average price of $66,953. https://t.co/WYPGmoZcB0 pic.twitter.com/S2BCAyYVn2 — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) December 2, 2024 In the following hours, BTC’s price slumped from over $98,000 to under $95,000 before recovering slightly to just over the latter. Despite its minor bounce-off, the cryptocurrency still trades below $96,175, which popular analyst Ali outlined as a significant level that has to endure for the asset to continue its trajectory toward $100,000 and beyond. This is because over a million bitcoin addresses have accumulated more than 950,000 BTC at that average price, effectively turning it into a strong support. As long as #Bitcoin $BTC holds above $96,175, the odds favor the bulls! pic.twitter.com/18097DlAPF — Ali (@ali_charts) December 1, 2024 No Need to Panic, Yet? Although BTC has dumped below the crucial $96,175 line, Glassnode’s Rafael said there’s still no need to panic, at least according to the relative unrealized profit metric. When it goes above 0.9, it shows when the market is overheated due to the large number of investors sitting on paper gains. Historically, such a number has resulted in immediate price corrections for the asset, as seen in the chart below. Currently, though, the metric is at 0.74, which is under the overheated levels seen in previous cycles. Consequently, Rafael concluded that “there’s room to run.” The relative unrealized profit of #bitcoin long-term holders currently sitting at 0.74, well below the overheated levels seen in previous cycles—there’s room to run.

The token recently surged past a key level despite a double-digit decline in the SHIB burn rate. Over the past year, Shiba Inu price has skyrocketed by 260%, reflecting its robust community support and market resilience. With bullish sentiment mounting, the coin is setting sights on a potential milestone by the end of 2024. Shiba Inu Price Increases Amid an 84% Plunge in SHIB Burns The Shiba Inu price has experienced a remarkable surge despite a significant decline in its token burn rate. Over the past month, the meme coin has gained over 70%, with a 17% increase in the last week. This impressive price momentum comes as SHIB’s burn rate dropped by a staggering 84% in the past 24 hours, with only 62,005,008 SHIB tokens burned. The sharp contrast between the rising price and the reduced burn rate has sparked interest and speculation among the cryptocurrency community. Token burns have been a cornerstone of Shiba Inu’s strategy to reduce circulating supply and boost value over time. Despite the current drop in burns, the strong price performance indicates heightened market demand and investor interest. Source- Shibburn How High Can SHIB Price Go In Dec After Soaring Above $0.00003? At the time of writing, the SHIB price has reached approximately $0.00003009, gaining strong bullish traction in the markets. Bitcoin trades above $96,000, while Ethereum maintains its position above $3,600, reflecting a broader crypto market upswing. The Shiba Inu price prediction is witnessing a significant surge in price momentum. Analysts suggest that if the ongoing rally sustains, SHIB might test its critical resistance at $0.000037. If the token surpasses the resistance level, it could pave the way for a rally toward $0.00005 by the end of 2024. Source: X Shiba Inu’s resilience and price surge highlight its growing market demand despite declining burn rates.

The S&P 500 soared 5.73%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 7.54%, and the Nasdaq Composite gained 6.21%. Both the Dow and S&P 500 hit all-time highs during Friday’s shortened trading session in a triumphant end to a month that was nothing short of historic. Small-cap stocks stole part of the spotlight, with the Russell 2000 Index skyrocketing over 10%—its biggest monthly gain of the year. Investors leaned heavily into small caps, anticipating that the Trump administration’s promised tax cuts would disproportionately benefit smaller, U.S.-focused businesses. Stocks saw big gains due to Trump’s win The markets hate uncertainty, and Donald Trump’s decisive election win provided the clarity investors craved. With the political noise out of the way, traders poured into equities, boosting all major indexes. Trump’s stock-market-friendly policies—centered on deregulation, lower taxes, and general market enthusiasm—played a massive role in driving November’s record-breaking gains. The U.S. economy was no slouch in November either. It grew at a 2.8% annualized rate in the third quarter. While the fourth quarter is projected to slow to 1.31%, according to the St. Louis Fed, even that modest growth is enough to keep the recession fears at bay. Slow growth might actually be a blessing in disguise, giving the Federal Reserve room to cut rates again during its December meeting. Inflation, meanwhile, held steady. In Europe, annual inflation in the eurozone ticked up to 2.3% from October’s 2%, a manageable number that didn’t deter investors. The pan-European Stoxx 600 Index gained 0.58% on Friday, closing November 0.96% higher. On the global stage, India’s economic data was kind of a letdown. The country reported disappointing growth numbers, with its GDP expanding by 5.4% in the fiscal quarter ending in September. That’s a steep drop from the previous quarter’s 6.7% and far below the 6.5% predicted by analysts. The Reserve Bank of India’s 7% projection now feels like a far-fetched dream. Bitcoin’s second-best month of the year November wasn’t just about traditional markets though. In fact, crypto’s king Bitcoin was the best-performing asset in what was its second-best month in 2024, skyrocketing 38%. Investors poured into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which saw their largest single-day inflows during this period. Profit-taking was offset by fresh enthusiasm, especially with the launch of options on Bitcoin ETFs. At one point, Bitcoin was literally worth over $99,700. It broke so many all-time highs, it was hard to keep count. At press time, it was hovering around $97,000, but expectations of breaking $100,000 this year are sky-high. Short sellers had a rough month. Many were forced to buy stocks and cryptos to cover their positions as the market climbed, further fueling gains. This year-end rush, combined with seasonal optimism, created a perfect storm for the markets. Stocks futures trading on Monday suggested a quieter start to December though, with Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq futures all dipping slightly in early morning trades.

Lilic suggested that President-elect Donald Trump should think about pardoning CZ in light of his past criminal charges that led to him receiving a four-month prison sentence. “President @realDonaldTrump should consider a pardon for @cz_binance so he can return to being the CEO of @binance and help the crypto industry mature, and realize its full potential.

Speaking to Microsoft’s board, Saylor delivered a fast-paced, three-minute pitch supported by a 44-slide deck, laying out his vision of Bitcoin as the next major technological wave. Whether Microsoft will heed Saylor’s proposal remains to be seen, but the pitch underscores Bitcoin’s growing influence on corporate strategy discussions. Microsoft with $5 Trillion Potential Saylor’s pitch focused on the immense value he believes Bitcoin could unlock for Microsoft. He suggested the company redirect its cash flow, dividend payouts, debt, and stock buybacks into acquiring Bitcoin. By doing so, he projected Microsoft’s share price could increase by $584 over the next decade, assuming Bitcoin reaches $1.7 million per coin by 2034. The boldest claim in his presentation was that Microsoft could boost its market cap by a staggering $4.9 trillion, propelling the company far beyond its current $3.18 trillion valuation. Saylor argued that Bitcoin offers unparalleled growth potential, saying, “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is that wave.” He further likened Bitcoin to a high-growth business available at an unbeatable valuation, stating its strategic advantage over traditional financial assets like bonds or stock buybacks. “What if you could buy a $100 billion company growing faster than Microsoft for one times revenue?” Saylor asked, underscoring Bitcoin’s perceived value. A Crypto Renaissance Saylor’s confidence in Bitcoin comes amid a surge in its value, which has climbed 120% this year to approach $100,000. His own company, MicroStrategy, has been a pioneer in corporate Bitcoin adoption , accumulating 386,700 BTC since 2020 at a cost of $21.9 billion. With Bitcoin now trading at $97,200, MicroStrategy’s holdings are worth nearly $37.6 billion, pushing its stock to new highs. The timing of Saylor’s pitch aligns with growing public and political support for cryptocurrency. He pointed to pro-crypto statements from incoming U.S. President Donald Trump and the introduction of Bitcoin investment products by leading Wall Street firms. Saylor concluded his pitch with a call to action, urging Microsoft to invest $100 billion annually in Bitcoin. “It’s time for Microsoft to evaluate its Bitcoin strategic options,” he said, emphasizing the potential benefits for shareholders and the broader financial ecosystem.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 09:52:00

The broker noted that on Friday Blackrock's spot ether ETF saw inflows of $250 million, versus only $137 million of inflows for the asset manager's larger spot bitcoin ETF. ""This creates favorable demand-supply dynamics for ETH,"" analysts led by Gautam Chhugani wrote. Ether staking yields could be another tailwind for the cryptocurrency. Bernstein noted that initial ether spot ETF applications did not include yields due to regulatory limitations. ""Under a new Trump 2.0 crypto friendly SEC, ETH staking yield will likely be approved,"" the authors wrote, adding that as Ethereum blockchain activity surges the ether yield can grow to 4-5%. Ethereum blockchain activity is on the up, and the network remains the platform of choice for asset tokenization and stablecoins, the report said. Following Ethereum's transition to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, the supply of ether has remained ""stagnant"" at a total of 120 million tokens, Bernstein said. Ethereum's transaction fees deliver a yield of around 3% to stakers, which keeps about 28% of ether supply locked in staking contracts, the report noted. Another 10% of supply is locked in deposit and lending contracts. Almost 60% of ether has not changed hands in the last 12 months which is indicative of a ""resilient investor base,"" and this reinforces the positive demand-supply dynamics for the cryptocurrency, the report added.

While it is wondered whether the rise in XRP will continue at full speed, 50-year analyst Peter Brandt argued that another altcoin could follow the rise in XRP and experience a boom.

Back in late 2021, when Bitcoin’s dominance dipped, altcoins exploded with over 140% growth. Experts now see similar conditions brewing, with Bitcoin pushing toward $100,000. After Bitcoin’s rally, altcoins often take the lead, and this could be a golden chance for massive gains, especially for selective altcoins. Veteran trader Peter Brandt weighed in on this, suggesting that Litecoin could hit $420, similar to XRP’s recent rise. He posted a chart on social media comparing the two coins, which has excited the crypto traders looking to diversify their portfolios. Surprisingly, Litecoin (LTC) is showing some quick price movements. The coin surged by over 21% in just one day, currently trading above $120, and its trading volume reached $2.58 billion, signaling strong interest from investors. Keeping the indicators and chart in mind analysts think Litecoin could follow in the footsteps of XRP, which recently experienced a massive rally. Is Litecoin Ready for Altcoin Season? The Altcoin Season Index is at 59, meaning Bitcoin is still leading the market, but some altcoins like Litecoin are starting to rise and show promise. The key factor that boosted this bullish sentiment is the renewed interest of big bulls in the crypto market, boosted by Donald Trump’s election victory and the potential resignation of US SEC Chair Gary Gensler. These events are fueling expectations of more favorable regulations for cryptocurrencies. Plus, the possibility of a Litecoin ETF approval in the US has traders excited, as it could increase demand for the asset. Based on the charts he also sees a better opportunity for XRP which hit $2 today and flipped major coins like Solana and USDT in market cap. Taking the 3rd position in the crypto market. What Analysts Are Saying Crypto experts like Tony Severino and Crypto Snorlax believe Litecoin is positioned for a “parabolic rally.” Severino noted that Litecoin is showing bullish indicators, including breaking above key resistance levels. He compared Litecoin’s chart to XRP’s recent price action, suggesting that Litecoin could soon experience a similar upward surge. Severino speculates that LTC could even reach its all-time high of $412, or potentially higher. Meanwhile, Crypto Snorlax emphasized the strong correlation between old altcoins like Litecoin and XRP. He pointed out that Litecoin just broke above an 18-month resistance level, which he sees as a sign that the coin could rally further, possibly reaching new heights of $450. Moreover, Litecoin is gaining attention with its strong market momentum and upcoming network upgrades, making it a promising altcoin to watch for potentially explosive growth during the current altseason. But if that gave you the impression that all altcoins may explode in 2025, think again not all altcoins are showing signs of breakout hence make your choice wisely.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|LTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-02 09:58:19

Kiyosaki warns Bitcoin will crash to $60,000",https://finbold.com/rich-dad-r-kiyosaki-warns-bitcoin-will-crash-to-60000/,"The famed Bitcoin ( BTC ) bull and author of the best-selling personal finance book ‘ Rich Dad Poor Dad ’ Robert Kiyosaki’s most recent X post indicates, at face value, that the prominent investor has finally turned bearish on the cryptocurrency. Specifically, Kiyosaki concluded that BTC’s stalling slightly short of $100,000 indicates it is bound for a substantial correction and predicted the coin might plunge as low as $60,000. Despite the bearish forecast, the famous author quickly turned his argument optimistic, explaining that such a cryptocurrency market move would, in fact, constitute a Bitcoin ‘sale’ and stressed that he would not be selling and would instead use the opportunity to buy more BTC. Bitcoin is stalled short of $100k. That means BTC may crash to $60k. If and when that happens I will not sell. BTC will be having a sale. I will buy more. Additionally, the prominent investor added he still estimates the coin would reach $250 – likely meaning $250,000 – in 2025. BITCOIN to CRASH Bitcoin is stalled short of $100k. That means BTC may crash to $60k. If and when that happens I will not sell. BTC will be having a sale. I will buy more. I predict Bitcoin will settle around $250 in 2025. At this stage of the BTC process… price is not… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) December 1, 2024 Robert Kiyosaki says ‘FOMO is good’ then warns of a correction While not uncharacteristically bearish, the X post can be seen as somewhat odd, perhaps even contradictory. Indeed, while Kiyosaki predicted a plunge to $60,000 on December 1, on November 30, he opined Bitcoin will soon climb to $100,000 and added ‘FOMO is good’ while urging his followers not to ‘be left behind.’ Additionally, the author also explained in the November 30 post that the ‘rich will get richer’ while describing the rich and the soon-to-be rich as those who are invested in gold , silver , and Bitcoin. THE RICH WILL GET RICHER: Q: WHO WiLL BE RICHER? A: The people who save Gold, Silver. Bitcoin. I own all three financial assets. Q: WhO WILL BE POORER? A: The people who save dollars, Pesos, Yen, Euro, & Loonies. As I warned in Rich Dad Poor Dad “Savers are losers…because… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) November 29, 2024 Kiyosaki has been a long-term advocate for BTC and the two commodities and is known for his bets on Solana ( SOL ), Ethereum (ETH), and wagyu cattle while also having a large real estate portfolio. Simultaneously, the famous investor raised another of his long-standing talking points: that those who save American dollars and other similar currencies will grow poorer since ‘cash is trash.’ Finally, while it is impossible why Robert Kiyosaki changed his prediction from $100,000 Bitcoin being right around the corner to a looming correction to $60,000 before the high target is reached within approximately 24 hours, both posts fall in line with the author’s broader narrative. Specifically, he has, in general, been recommending BTC no matter the circumstances – and, indeed, in the December 1 post, he stated that ‘price is not as important.’ Given the author’s $250,000 forecast for 2025, and his agreement with MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) Michael Saylor’s $14 million 20-year price target, it shouldn’t matter if a trader purchases Bitcoin at its press time price of $95,358 or after a correction to $60,000 or another price. Bitcoin price chart Whatever the truth and accuracy of Robert Kiyosaki’s overall forecasts ends up being, Bitcoin’s most recent performance indicates there is truth to the correction prediction. Specifically, BTC began dropping late on December 1, and it stands at $95,358 at press time. BTC 7-day price chart. Source: Finbold Furthermore, though the weekly chart is red and shows the cryptocurrency has fallen 3.23% within the timeframe, it is worth remembering it is also just some $4,000 short of the all-time high (ATH) and remains a staggering 115.57% in the green year-to-date (YTD).

Hong Kong-based Boyaa Interactive recently shifted a large portion of its Ethereum holdings into Bitcoin. On the other hand, Japan's DMM Bitcoin exchange is shutting down after a devastating hack earlier this year. Meanwhile, analysts predict a bullish December for Bitcoin, though some still warn about possible corrections ahead. Michael Saylor Sees Bitcoin as Microsoft’s Key to Future Dominance Michael Saylor, chair of MicroStrategy and a well known advocate for Bitcoin (BTC), recently delivered a bold pitch to Microsoft’s board of directors. During this pitch, Saylor suggested that the tech giant could greatly boost its market capitalization by embracing Bitcoin. Michael Saylors MSFT market cap estimates (Source: Michael Saylor ) In a presentation that was shared via video on Dec. 1, Saylor proposed that Microsoft could add almost $5 trillion to its value by converting its cash flows, dividends, stock buybacks, and debt into Bitcoin. The three-minute presentation was accompanied by a 44-slide deck, and mainly centered around Bitcoin as the cornerstone of Microsoft's future strategy. Saylor argued that Bitcoin represents the next transformative wave in technology, and warned that missing it could leave Microsoft at a disadvantage. According to his projections, Bitcoin could add up to $584 to Microsoft’s share price over the next decade, assuming the crypto’s value reaches $1.7 million per BTC by 2034. This aggressive strategy will generate immense enterprise value while reducing risk for shareholders. Michael Saylor’s MSFT share price estimations (Source: Michael Saylor ) Microsoft is the third most valuable company globally, with its valuation of $3.18 trillion. Saylor suggested that an annual investment of $100 billion into Bitcoin will be a much more lucrative alternative to stock buybacks or holding bonds. He also mentioned the growing public and political support for Bitcoin, and referred to some pro-crypto statements from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and recent Bitcoin-related products introduced by major Wall Street firms. He believes this is evidence of a “crypto renaissance.” MicroStrategy’s own experience with Bitcoin has been quite successful. Since 2020, the company bought 386,700 BTC for $21.9 billion, which is an investment that is now worth close to $37.6 billion at Bitcoin’s current price. This strategy also propelled MicroStrategy’s stock price , which surged 465.5% in 2024 to reach a record high of $421.88 in November. Saylor finished his pitch by urging Microsoft to seize the opportunity. He also framed Bitcoin not only as an investment, but as a transformative strategic asset. He even challenged the board to “do the right thing for the world and adopt Bitcoin.” Hong Kong’s Boyaa Shifts Crypto Strategy to Bitcoin Boyaa Interactive International, a Hong Kong-based gaming company that is known for its online card and board games, reshaped its crypto treasury strategy by converting a big portion of its Ethereum (ETH) holdings into Bitcoin. Between Nov. 19 and 28, the company exchanged 14,200 ETH, which is valued at close to $49 million, for approximately 515 Bitcoin. This move increases Boyaa's Bitcoin reserves to 3,183 BTC, worth an estimated $310.7 million at current market prices. In a statement , the company shared that it is very confident in Bitcoin’s future prospects, and considers this a suitable time to expand its reserves by reallocating from Ethereum to Bitcoin. According to its third-quarter results , Boyaa previously held 2,635 Bitcoin and 15,388 ETH in its treasury. This recent conversion also aligns with the company's initial $100 million crypto allocation strategy that was launched in November of 2023. The strategy earmarked $45 million each for Bitcoin and Ethereum and $10 million for stablecoins like Tether and USD Coin. The shift happened during larger price movements in the crypto market. Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin gained more than 6%. The crypto king is also in the green by more than 36% on its monthly time frame. ETH surged by over 45% over the past month to trade at $3,629 at press time. Despite Ethereum’s stronger short-term performance, Boyaa's board chose to prioritize Bitcoin due to its strategic value for the company’s long-term plans. BTC’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Boyaa’s stock price also saw remarkable growth after rising 874% over the past year to $0.68 (5.26 Hong Kong dollars). However, the company’s share value is still below its all-time high of $1.81. Boyaa joined a growing list of companies increasing their Bitcoin holdings. Other firms like Rumble , Semler Scientific, and Genius Group also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets in November. Japanese Exchange DMM Bitcoin to Liquidate On the other hand, Japanese crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin is set to liquidate after failing to recover from a May hack that resulted in the theft of about $320 million in Bitcoin. The company announced plans to transfer customer assets to SBI VC Trade, which is an exchange operator under SBI Group, by March of 2025. This decision was made after a basic agreement between the two firms to facilitate the transfer of all accounts and deposit assets, including both Japanese yen and crypto holdings. The breach happened on May 30, when more than 4,500 Bitcoin were stolen through a private key hack, which the company described as an “unauthorized leak.” At the time, DMM Bitcoin assured its customers that all deposits will be fully guaranteed. The exchange also stopped withdrawals, account openings, and trading, but pledged to procure funds to compensate users. Despite these efforts, the exchange was unable to recover after the second-largest crypto hack in Japan’s history. The stolen funds have been partially laundered. Blockchain investigator ZachXBT reported in July that around $35 million was funneled to the online marketplace Huione Guarantee. The laundering techniques and indicators suggest that North Korea’s Lazarus Group may have orchestrated the attack. DMM Bitcoin, which was launched in January of 2018 under the ownership of Japanese e-commerce giant DMM Group, faced seven more challenges over the past few months. In November, it discontinued its Seamoon Protocol , a Web3 gaming and anime content initiative, because of rapid changes in the business environment. The firm also shelved plans to issue a stablecoin in partnership with Progmat. The collapse of DMM Bitcoin is part of a broader trend of centralized exchange hacks in 2024. The year saw some major incidents that affected platforms like WazirX in India, BingX in Singapore, and BtcTurk in Turkey, resulting in combined losses of hundreds of millions of dollars. December Bull Run Expected Those companies taking advantage of Bitcoin might reap the rewards of their decision soon. Bitcoin may be entering a price discovery phase that could signal potential ”insane long opportunities” in the months ahead, according to analysts. Daan Crypto Trades , a trader and analyst, said on Dec. 2 that Bitcoin maintained a position above its previous all-time high for nearly a month, which signals the start of its price discovery phase for this cycle. By drawing parallels to past cycles, the analyst pointed out that Bitcoin surged by 1,600% during the 2017 bull market and 245% during the 2021 bull market. Even a modest repeat of half the 2021 gains could push Bitcoin’s price to around $150,000. Price discovery is where an asset’s fair market value is established through buyer and seller interactions, and it usually begins when it trades above previous highs. Charles Edwards , founder of Capriole Fund, believes there is a lot of potential for returns during this phase, especially as each cycle historically delivers 4-7 months of exceptional price discovery gains. He also pointed out that November was the first of these months, with Bitcoin gaining 40% and breaking monthly candle records. December is historically a bullish month for Bitcoin, with average gains of about 10%. Markus Thielen, founder and CEO of 10x Research, pointed out that during halving years, December returns have been particularly strong, averaging 28% across 2012, 2016, and 2020. John Glover , chief investment officer at Ledn, is not as optimistic about the month ahead, and suggested that while momentum could drive Bitcoin toward $125,000, a larger correction is still a possibility. He did reassure traders that a drastic sell-off is unlikely unless Bitcoin breaches the March 2024 high near $74,000.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-02 11:28:06

However, a new blockchain token, Lightchain AI , is emerging as a serious challenger to Ethereum’s dominance—specifically in the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) applications. With its revolutionary approach to integrating AI into blockchain ecosystems, Lightchain AI is capturing the attention of analysts and investors as the next big thing in decentralized technology. What Makes Lightchain AI a Serious Contender? Unlike Ethereum, which focuses on generalized blockchain applications, Lightchain AI has carved out a niche by seamlessly merging blockchain and AI. This focus gives it a significant edge in targeting industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics, where AI integration can deliver transformative results. Key Features of Lightchain AI: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): A cutting-edge consensus mechanism that rewards participants for executing AI computations, such as machine learning and predictive modeling, instead of traditional mining or staking. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): Lightchain AI’s AIVM enables developers to deploy and execute AI-specific tasks directly on the blockchain, making it ideal for real-time data analysis and automation. Scalability and Efficiency: By incorporating advanced sharding and Layer 2 solutions, Lightchain AI ensures that its network remains scalable, efficient, and eco-friendly, even as usage grows. Early Investment Opportunity: Currently priced at just $0.07 during its presale, Lightchain AI offers an incredible entry point for investors seeking exponential returns. Ethereum’s Strengths—and Its Limitations Why Ethereum Leads the Market: First-Mover Advantage: Ethereum introduced smart contracts and created a thriving developer ecosystem. Extensive Use Cases: Powers thousands of decentralized applications (dApps), from DeFi protocols to NFTs. Transition to Proof of Stake (PoS): Ethereum 2.0 has improved scalability and energy efficiency, addressing key criticisms of the original network. Challenges Ethereum Faces in AI Integration: Generalized Infrastructure: While versatile, Ethereum lacks native support for AI-specific applications. Scalability Bottlenecks: Despite Ethereum 2.0, high gas fees and occasional congestion remain concerns. Competition from Specialized Platforms: New blockchains like Lightchain AI are better equipped to handle specific use cases like AI. How Lightchain AI Stands Out from Ethereum While Ethereum is a general-purpose blockchain, Lightchain AI’s specialization in AI applications gives it an undeniable advantage in certain sectors. AI-Specific Focus: Lightchain AI’s AIVM enables tasks that Ethereum cannot natively support, such as training machine learning models directly on-chain. Lower Costs: With its optimized infrastructure, Lightchain AI offers a cost-effective alternative to Ethereum’s gas fees. Targeted Growth: Lightchain AI’s presale funds are strategically allocated to further its mission of bridging AI and blockchain technology. Real-World Applications Driving Lightchain AI’s Momentum Healthcare: AI-powered diagnostics and patient data analysis can be securely processed on Lightchain AI’s decentralized network. Finance: Predictive analytics for fraud detection and automated trading models leverage the platform’s AI capabilities. Logistics: Lightchain AI facilitates real-time optimization of supply chains through advanced data processing and AI modeling. These applications highlight Lightchain AI’s ability to target industries where Ethereum’s generalized infrastructure may fall short.

Despite the courtroom fight not being quite finished – it will enter its next and possibly final chapter in January 2025 – XRP has recently exploded in value on a string of positive news. Specifically, Donald Trump’s re-election – and the anticipated pro-cryptocurrency pivot expected from it – and the news that SEC Chair Gary Gensler will resign on January 20 served to ignite the built-up optimism from Ripple’s courtroom wins. Overall, the setup ensured that XRP is 351.69% in the green over the last 30 days, with a press time price of $2.33. XRP 30-day price chart. Source: Finbold Here’s how much a 2020 XRP investment would have returned Considering the SEC lawsuit served as the starting point of the dominant strand of the XRP saga – and that the sage now appears poised for an epilogue – Finbold decided how much would have an investment made in late 2020, either as a show of support for Ripple or taking advantage of the ‘buy the dip’ moment, be worth today, on December 2, 2024. On December 22, 2020 – the day the SEC announced its case against Ripple Labs, Brad Garlinghouse, and Christian Larsen – XRP stood at $0.4484. Just one day later, the value of the token plunged to $0.2586. This means a $1,000 investment made when the SEC unveiled its lawsuit would have initially lost nearly half its value in a day. However, by Monday, December 2, 2024, it would have grown by an impressive 123.02%, reaching $2,230.15 – a profit of $1,230.15. An investment made one day after the watchdog’s announcement – as a show of confidence in Ripple, taking advantage of the ‘buy the dip’ opportunity, or for an entirely different reason – would have been even more lucrative. Specifically, $1,000 invested on December 23, 2020, would have grown 286.7% by press time to a total value of $3,866.98 – a $2,866.98 profit. Will XRP continue surging into 2025 Looking ahead, XPR’s future appears as bright as its last 30 days. Numerous analysts have taken their turns analyzing the token and trying to gauge its likely pathway to high targets such as $6 . Furthermore, a new all-time high (ATH) for XRP in 2025 appears highly likely , particularly as significant whale activity in recent weeks has bolstered ever-higher support zones. Still, it is worth remembering that January could bring another twist in the Ripple-SEC legal battle – one with a non-zero chance of being adverse for the cryptocurrency – and the very nature of the market means that there are no guarantees XRP’s upcoming performance will mimic the current trends.

Many analysts believed December might get even better, offering higher gains, with the Bitcoin value aiming at $100k. However, that is the story for later, but many opportunities are growing in the airdrops sections right now. A new Wise Monkey airdrop is going live soon, where the token is based on a proverb of three wise monkeys, ‘See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No Evil.’ With high demand, the team has revealed the listing date, eligibility criteria, and many other details. Monkey Airdrop Going Live Date, Eligibility Criteria & More In the Airdrops list 2024 , Monkey airdrop is trending as the famous gaming and crypto firm Forj, a subsidiary of Animoca Brands, is launching this Monkey-themed meme coin called Wise Monkey. More importantly, many crypto exchanges like Binance, Kucoin, OKX, and others are supporting this crypto airdrop. The MONKY airdrop is going live in December, with the token launch on December 12. Interestingly, this airdrop is in collaboration with FLOKI, which limits it to FLOKI, APE, and TOKEN users. FLOKI TO SUPPORT THE WISE MONKEY (MONKY) LAUNCH We’re thrilled to announce that Floki will support the launch of the highly-anticipated Wise Monkey / $MONKY IP memecoin – an exciting new project brought to you by Forj, a subsidiary of Animoca Brands. Forj, Animoca Brands has… pic.twitter.com/jfIjn9JMDi — FLOKI (@RealFlokiInu) November 14, 2024 Most importantly, the crypto airdrop will go live on the BNB chain and various popular crypto exchanges on different dates. The user can check their eligibility on tb.floki.com MONKY Airdrop Eligibility & Distribution Criteria Through this MONKY airdrop, the FLOKI, Forj, and Animoca Brand are collaborating, so a major portion is allocated for the FLOKI community. The Wise Monkey and FLOKI announcement confirms the allocation of 35% of the total MONKY supply to the Floki community. Out of this, the team will directly share 2.7 Trillion MONKY or 27% of the supply to FLOKI holders on various popular crypto exchanges on December 15, 2024. An additional 4% will be distributed among Floki trading bot users, and another 4% will be allocated to the TokenFi (TOKEN) holders on-chain. Interestingly, the APE holders are also eligible for a 10% airdrop. Terms & Conditions for FLOKI Holders The team has allocated 35% of this crypto airdrop to the FLOKI holders and FLOKI trading bot users. The trading bot users are directly eligible for the 4% Monkey airdrop, but for the FLOKI holder, it depends on various factors. Here, the distribution ratio is 0.35 MONKY for 1 FLOKI, which means a user with 100 FLOKI will receive 35 MONKY, a user with 1000 FLOKI will receive 350 MONKY, and so on. The basic requirement is that a person should hold at least 1 FLOKI token, but the quantity of airdrop will vary depending on the quantity of holdings. Terms & Conditions for TOKEN Holders The Tokenfi (TOKEN) holders are eligible for 4% of the Monkey airdrop, where the distribution criteria say to hold at least 1 TOKEN. Here, the distribution is like 130 MONKY for 1 TOKEN. For example, if a person has 100 TOKEN, he will receive 13,000 MONKY, and so on. Terms & Conditions for APE Holders The official announcement stated that APE holders are eligible for a 10% MONKY airdrop. In this, 8% is allocated to the APE holders on-chain and on supported centralized exchanges, 1% to the Ape Accelerator Supporters, and the remaining 1% to ApeFest attendees. Overall, the team will airdrop 800 Billion tokens for the APE holders. However, the Monkey airdrop has been live for APE holders since November 29, 2024, so new users cannot participate in this anymore. The 1 APE holder is receiving 804,828 MONKY. So, if someone holds 100 APE, they will receive 804,828,00, and the counting continues. What’s The Expected MONKY Token Price on Listing? Kucoin and many other popular crypto exchanges have shown support for the MONKY token even before its official release, which confirms the high demand for the token. More importantly, the collaboration of a major gaming and crypto firm, Forj, with one of the biggest tokens in the top meme coins list , is likely to grow its demand even further. Wise Monkey @MonkyMeme is swinging into #KuCoin —stay tuned! pic.twitter.com/pIfq2HQDcD — KuCoin (@kucoincom) November 30, 2024 For now, the listing price is not unknown. More importantly, the focus is on how high the token could grow past the launch, as the Monkey airdrop volatility could impact its Monky token price. However, its demand speaks for a possible rally right after launch. Bottom Line The Monkey airdrop is one of the most anticipated crypto airdrops at this point due to Forj’s mission to bring together gaming, web3, and blockchain technology with this token. Kucoin and a few other crypto exchanges are listing this token on December 12, 2024. However, the MONKY airdrop distribution varies depending on many factors. For FLOKI and TokenFi holders, the airdrop will go live on December 15, 2024. However, it is already live for APE holders. As a result, new APE users could not participate. Overall, the MONKY team will distribute around 45% of tokens in the airdrop, where 35% is reserved for the FLOKI community and 10% for the APE community.

Cardano’s bullish surge and Rollblock’s explosive presale gains spark investor optimism, with both tokens poised for significant growth in the crypto market. Table of Contents Rollblock branches into iGaming market, increasing profit margin Cardano rockets following recent network developments Conclusion Cardano (ADA) and Rollblock (RBLK) have sparked optimism among investors. With increased trading volume and growing market confidence, ADA’s recent performance has analysts speculating whether this could mark the beginning of a broader bull run. On the other hand, Rollblock is nearing the end of its public presale. With over $6.5 million generated and projections of 800% post-launch, could this rally signal a turning point for RBLK or ADA in the crypto market? Find the details below. Rollblock branches into iGaming market, increasing profit margin Rollblock takes online gambling to a whole new level by fusing it with blockchain technology and a reward-based ecosystem. The games, exclusive events, and financial compensations in return are powered by the RBLK token. By embedding DeFi features into the platform, Rollblock provides a unique opportunity through which both players and investors can benefit from its growth. The most outstanding feature of Rollblock is its revenue-sharing model. Token holders are rewarded for staking their RBLK by sharing in the revenues from the platform on a week-to-week basis. That creates long-term involvement, and the user earns passive income when the platform does well. Additionally, Rollblock provides staking bonuses and cashback rewards, enhancing the player experience and incentivizing continued engagement. Regarding long-term value, Rollblock provides a deflationary mechanism that accommodates token buybacks and burns. Using these strategies reduces the circulating supply of RBLK, which creates scarcity and increases in value over time. With a focus on security, transparency, and user rewards, Rollblock maintains an edge over the rising iGaming scene. A perfect mix of the best elements of gaming and decentralized finance, Rollblock provides a platform where players and investors can thrive together. Cardano rockets following recent network developments ADA has been on a bull run, with a price climb exceeding 200% in the past month. As of November 30, the coin is approaching important resistance levels, notably $1.15 and $1.22. This bullish momentum is supported by a favorable technical outlook, including ADA trading above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. The market sentiment surrounding Cardano has been strengthened by the ZK smart contract on Halo 2, the upcoming Hydra scaling upgrade, and its expansion into decentralized finance. Additionally, the recent 54% spike in trading volume indicates growing investor demand and the price has shown resilience with solid support levels of around $1. With 22 green days in the last 30, some analysts project a 140% surge in the coming months. Sentiments on the ADA network are largely positive following a 119% increase in daily active addresses. If ADA can break through its key resistance levels, it could push the price toward $1.30 by the end of 2024. Conclusion While Cardano predictions indicate a potential increase of around 110% in the coming months, Rollblock’s projections exceed an impressive 750% for the same period. During the Rollblock presale, each RBLK token is priced at $0.037. Investors are currently participating in the eighth stage, where early holders can benefit from attractive tiered bonuses based on their RBLK holdings.

Kiyosaki, who is famous for his bold comments about financial markets, the US government and the FED, stated that Bitcoin could experience a sharp decline in the short term. Despite concerns about a possible price drop to $60,000, Kiyosaki continues to hold Bitcoin as part of his portfolio. The famous name showed his belief in the long-term potential of Bitcoin by stating that if his prediction comes true and BTC drops to $60,000, he will not sell his BTCs and will even see this drop as an opportunity to buy more Bitcoin. “Bitcoin is crashing: Bitcoin remains below $100,000. This means that BTC could drop to $60,000. “If and when I won't sell. BTC will sell. I'll buy more.” Kiyosaki stated that the rise in Bitcoin has just begun and thinks that Bitcoin is likely to reach $250,000 in 2025. While this estimate would be 2.5 times the current BTC price, Kiyosaki stated that Bitcoin could fall to $60,000 before reaching $250,000. *This is not investment advice.

Notably, this comes as XRP has noted a strong rally recently, surpassing the market cap of BNB and USDT. In addition, the filing also showcases the market confidence towards the digital assets and its regulatory dynamics, especially after Donald Trump’s election win. WisdomTree Files S-1 For XRP ETF Approval WisdomTree’s S-1 filing for an XRP ETF, registered in Delaware, has sparked optimism across the crypto industry. This development follows XRP’s remarkable rally, which underscored its growing market relevance. Investors have shown renewed enthusiasm for digital assets, viewing this ETF as a milestone for broader institutional acceptance. Notably, XRP’s momentum is part of a larger crypto resurgence driven by Donald Trump’s recent election victory. Market participants anticipate more crypto-friendly policies under his administration, which could accelerate ETF approvals. Notably, the experts have predicted a flurry of altcoins to witness their ETF launch in the US under the Republican government. In addition, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has also expressed optimism about XRP’s potential growth. Besides, he revealed ongoing discussions with the Republican administration, further boosting market confidence. However, the timing is notable as SEC Chair Gary Gensler is set to step down by January next year. His departure, whom many deem as an anti-crypto regulator, could usher in leadership that supports pro-crypto reforms. A Coinbase executive recently suggested that under Trump, crypto-specific legislation could pass “quickly”, signaling a favorable environment for institutional crypto adoption.

The ever-vigilant Ripple community was quick to outline new peaks for the asset, with some slightly ridiculous predictions of up to $20. Will XRP See New All-Time High Soon? The cryptocurrency market has been on fire ever since Donald J. Trump won the ’24 US presidential elections nearly a month ago. The charge was initially led by Bitcoin, which broke its March all-time high of $73,737 and skyrocketed to just shy of $100,000 for its latest peak. Numerous altcoins followed suit with immediate gains, such as Dogecoin, while others, like XRP, trailed behind at first but joined the party later and exceeded most expectations. Ripple’s token has been at the forefront of gains in the past month, having surged by 350% and tapping $2.5 earlier today for the first time since January 2018. Moreover, it surpassed several crypto assets on its way up in terms of market cap and even entered the top three briefly today. The XRP army, one of the most popular crypto communities, celebrated the move, and many posted their predictions about the asset’s future behavior. According to Xena XRP, the $3 level remains the biggest obstacle now in the token’s path toward a new all-time high of $3.4. If it breaks, then comes “price discovery… levels XRP has never been before.” JayXRP forecasted that the token will surge to $3.19 this week, while business consultant and market observer Jacob Canfield said XRP could rise up to $6.6, which is the “ideal FOMO target.” However, he believes there will be a pull back soon before the asset heads north again. The only difference between this $XRP move and those in the past is the price of Bitcoin is 5X higher than it was in 2017. If we use Canfield Fibonacci extensions to give us an idea of where this move may take us, it would be at the 11.09 fib exension.

Tony Edward, the host of Thinking Crypto Podcast, was also quite bullish on XRP, indicating a price target of somewhere between $5 and $8. At the same time, he blasted the quite ridiculous predictions of up to $10,000. My $XRP price target for this cycle $5-$8. It could go a bit higher but I’m gonna play it safe and be conservative.

With its current supply of over 57 billion tokens, such a price would put its market cap at $1.1 trillion, which would be second only to Bitcoin in the crypto industry.

Santa Pepe (SANPEPE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SANPEPE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Santa Pepe can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Santa Pepe could become the next viral memecoin. Santa Pepe launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Santa Pepe on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Santa Pepe by entering its contract address – 2NefXDdBhUkVn7dXW5wxVtCHKHKE8uiRGUqZGxT5HAN8 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SANPEPE.

In a three-minute presentation, Saylor outlined how Bitcoin could transform Microsoft’s financial strategy, potentially adding nearly $5 trillion to its market capitalization. Financial Growth and Enhanced Shareholder Returns “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is that wave,” Saylor declared. He described Bitcoin as the greatest digital transformation of the 21st century, labeling it a “digital capital” that is economically and technically superior to physical money. Saylor emphasized that the Redmond-based software maker should embrace digital capital, arguing that investing in Bitcoin offers greater advantages than stock buybacks or holding bonds. Highlighting Bitcoin’s potential, MicroStrategy’s Executive Chair projected it would grow to represent $280 trillion of global wealth within 20 years, surpassing gold and art. He pointed out that Microsoft’s adoption of the cryptocurrency would offer significant advantages. Saylor urged the company to convert its cash flows, dividend payouts, stock buybacks, and debt into BTC, stating this move could add hundreds of dollars to its stock price and create trillions in enterprise value. Specifically, he predicted that Bitcoin could increase Microsoft’s stock price by up to $584 per share over the next decade, assuming its value reaches $1.7 million by 2034. Currently valued at $3.18 trillion, Microsoft is the third most valuable firm globally. Saylor predicted that adopting Bitcoin could elevate its market cap by an additional $4.9 trillion. He framed the decision as a choice between clinging to outdated financial strategies or using Bitcoin to drive accelerated growth. “It’s time for Microsoft to evaluate its BTC strategic options,” he said in closing. “Do the right thing for the world and adopt Bitcoin.” Saylor Says He Can Convince Buffett to Buy Bitcoin Microsoft’s board of directors isn’t the only one Saylor is targeting as he continues his Bitcoin evangelism. In a recent appearance on the PBD Podcast, the BTC bull expressed confidence in his ability to convince Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett to embrace the cryptocurrency. “I’d be willing to bet you that if I had an hour alone with Buffett in a calm environment, I’d walk out, and he would say this Bitcoin thing is a pretty good idea,” he stated. Highlighting what he described as inefficiencies in Berkshire’s $325 billion cash reserve, Saylor argued that the funds generate just a 3% after-tax yield while facing a 15% cost of capital. He claimed this results in a 12% negative real yield and an annual shareholder value erosion of $32 billion. The 59-year-old has consistently promoted Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, urging companies with substantial cash reserves to integrate it into their financial strategies. This approach has gained popularity among several organizations, including Metaplanet, with 1,142 BTC , and Semler Scientific, which recently invested $29 million in BTC. Online video platform Rumble also recently announced a $20 million investment in the coin. However, MicroStrategy remains the largest publicly traded Bitcoin holder, with nearly 387,000 BTC reserves.

The protocol clarified in a December 1 statement on X that contrary to earlier claims by third parties, the exploit was not due to a private key leak but rather a design flaw within its withdrawal process. Hack Targets Two Liquidity Pools The breach, which occurred on December 1, impacted two of Clipper’s liquidity pools, amounting to 6% of the exchange’s total value locked (TVL). Clipper assured users that no other pools were affected and that the exploit has been resolved. “There have been third-party claims suggesting a private key leak,” Clipper stated. “We can confirm that this is not the case and is inconsistent with the design and security architecture of Clipper.” The vulnerability was linked to the ability to withdraw funds in the form of a single token, described as a “bundled swap + deposit/withdrawal transaction.” This feature has since been disabled as a precautionary measure. The incident came to light after Chaofan Shou, co-founder of the security firm Fuzzland, suggested on X that the hack could have resulted from an API vulnerability, enabling attackers to sign deposit and withdrawal requests fraudulently. Clipper dismissed these claims but acknowledged the need for a thorough investigation. Protocol Takes Action Amid Rising Crypto Thefts In the wake of the hack, Clipper has paused swaps and deposits while keeping withdrawals open, albeit with stricter conditions. Users can only withdraw funds in a mix of assets from the affected pools. The protocol is actively tracing the stolen funds and has extended an olive branch to the attacker, inviting them to initiate communication for potential negotiations. This breach adds to the troubling tally of over $1.48 billion in crypto stolen globally in 2024 , according to a recent Immunefi report. While this figure marks a 15% decline compared to the same period last year, it underscores the persistent vulnerabilities plaguing the DeFi sector. Shipyard Software Inc., the creator of Clipper, has yet to issue further statements regarding the incident. For Clipper and its users, the hack serves as a stark reminder of the importance of robust security protocols in safeguarding decentralized platforms.

HODL has been the time-honored philosophy of Bitcoin ( BTC ) holders. Rather than spending their growing wealth, those who own the biggest cryptocurrency have chosen to ‘hold on for dear life’ with an evangelistic zeal. Nevertheless, while Bitcoin, the king of crypto, continues to capture the headlines, the cryptocurrency space is in a very different place now from where it was just a few years ago. You might also like: The transformative potential of Bitcoin in the job market | Opinion Dogecoin ( DOGE ) may have been launched in 2013, but it is currently in the cycle of an explosion of interest in memecoins. While this market has unfortunately been prey to scams and pump-and-dump schemes, the growth and increasing significance of meme coins is an undeniable fact. Meanwhile, the architecture and payment rails of the space have also changed dramatically. In the past, Bitcoin holders who chose to sell their holdings and off-ramp rather than HODL often had to rely upon shady intermediaries, exorbitant fees, and snail-paced processing times. Now, holders of cryptocurrency have a variety of options for off-ramping, with payment specialists in the web3 space forming partnerships with giants from the TradFi space, such as Mastercard. Off-ramping from digital tokens into a fiat currency can now be done in a seamless and secure way with low fees and charges. Meme coin frenzy In the current bull market cycle, which has seen Bitcoin pierce a new all-time high above $97,000, the market capitalization of meme coins has skyrocketed from $56 billion to $118 billion following Trump’s re-election and a subsequent crypto bull run. Originally created as a joke based on the ‘Doge’ meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, DOGE is the biggest and most recognisable meme coin. Many meme coins are also named after endearing animals, one example being Moo Deng ( MOODENG ), the baby pygmy hippopotamus living in a Thai zoo. Elon Musk’s appointment to President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet as head of the new Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE, has fueled DOGE’s ascent, with the digital token now having a market capitalization of $58 billion. We’re now witnessing tens of thousands of meme coins attempting to emulate DOGE’s success being created each day on Pump.Fun, a Solana-based tool that removes technical barriers to developing the tokens. Crypto traders are FOMing into newly launched meme coins, often for just a few dollars, in the hope that the token will capture a cult-like following and soar in value. Non-custodial wallet Phantom, which provides users with an array of opportunities to bet on meme coins, has been propelled to the second spot on the charts in the utility section of the Apple App Store in the US. Those who make winning bets on meme coins often swap the tokens into established cryptocurrencies such as Solana to lock in profits and as a bridge before converting their holdings into a fiat currency. End of creaky payment rails The cryptocurrency space has evolved to a point where it is almost unrecognizable from where it was a decade ago. Notably, Mastercard and Visa have now entered the web3 ecosystem. Mercuryo’s Mastercard crypto debit card, Spend, bridges the gap between non-custodial crypto wallets and traditional payment methods. Spend is a plug-and-play solution that can be quickly integrated into a non-custodial wallet and rolled out to users who can add it to their Apple Pay or Google Play wallet. Spend is available to use online and in-store across Mastercard’s 100 million-plus network of merchants, providing users with a seamless, low-cost means of off-ramping their crypto holdings. Holders of the Spend card benefit from a level of consumer protection on a par with a traditional debit or credit card. The cryptocurrency space is continually evolving. The growing significance of meme coins has partly been driven by Generation Z’s dominance of social media channels such as Instagram, TikTok, and X. These social channels provide a public forum for newly launched meme coins to go viral and obtain a cult-like following. At the same time, we are witnessing the emergence of new payment products that provide crypto traders with an accessible and low-cost means of spending their trading profits. While the philosophy of HODL still resonates strongly with Bitcoin evangelists, newcomers to the web3 space arguably have more of a ‘live-for-today’ philosophy. Driven by a belief that life is short and crypto profits should be spent, these consumers are taking advantage of payment products that facilitate the off-ramping of cryptocurrency at a low cost. While it is pure speculation to guess how long the current crypto bull market will go on, what’s certain is that the market is continuing to evolve at a breakneck pace. This is reflected in a somewhat comedic fashion with the meme coin mania that we’ve been witnessing but also in the increasing sophistication of payment products in the space. These off-ramping services have levels of compliance and protection that are on par with payment products from traditional finance and enable people to spend their newfound crypto wealth in the real world.

As the JTO price drops under the $3.50 crucial milestone, the buyers are under panic. Will a double top reversal result in a pullback to the $2.68 support level? Let’s find out in our latest JITO price analysis. JTO Price Analysis In the daily chart, the JTO price trend continues a bullish rally of higher high formation. However, the intraday drop of 7.87% has warned of a sharp pullback. Tradingview Currently, the JTO price is trading at the psychological mark of $3.50, with the bearish engulfing candle crossing under the 50% Fibonacci level. The bearish engulfing candle undermines the bullish recovery over the last four days and warns of a bearish extension. The immediate support for the JTO price is $3.18, the 38.20% Fibonacci level. The trendline breakout rally continues to form higher highs. However, the pullbacks have been intense, with the previous one dropping from $3.18 to $2.68 in the second week of November. Furthermore, the current rejection from the $3.80 warns of a double top reversal. The neckline for the bearish pattern is at $3.45. Hence, a closing below this level will increase pressure over the $3.18 support level. Technical Indicators MACD: Supporting the chances of a bearish turnaround, the MACD and signal lines are merged and warn of a negative crossover. EMA: The dynamic average support lines of the 20, 50, and 100-day EMA are rising higher. The immediate dynamic support is provided by the 20-day EMA at $3.35. However, the significant support remains at the 50D EMA at $2.93. Will JTO Price Cross $3.18? In case of a bullish turnaround from the crucial dynamic average lines, the Fibonacci level swains the price target at the $4 psychological mark. However, the massive supply at $3.80 must be surpassed before the JTO price continues the higher high trend. Considering the broader market recovery, the JTO price could reach the $5.33 mark by the end of December if the support at $3.18 persists. In case of a bearish breakdown, the JTO price could retest the 100-day EMA at $2.70. As Solana crosses $200, how high will the SOL price go in 2024?

Crypto analysts, citing its strong fundamentals and technicals, believe that LINK could stage a strong rally, mirroring Ripple’s XRP. Chainlink Price Mirroring XRP and Rally 500% : Analyst Chainlink price soared and retested the important resistance level at $20 for the first time since March 11. This rally happened in sync with the ongoing recovery of Bitcoin and most altcoins, which pushed the crypto fear and greed index to 85. Crypto analysts are now optimistic that the coin could be on the verge of a strong bullish breakout. In an X post, Bullish noted that the coin had left a multi-year falling wedge pattern. He sees it rising by 500%, a move that would push it to $120. He cited XRP, which went vertical in November and jumped by 400% , pushing its market cap to over $130 billion. In another X post, Crypto Rand, a popular analyst predicted that the coin would gain momentum if it breaches the year-to-date high of $22.90. If that happens, he believes that the Chainlink “marines” will take over and push it higher. Marines are members of the Chainlink community who are similar to XRP Army. Chainlink Price Crypto Rand LINK Price Forecast As It Nears A Key Resistance The Chainlink price has had strong technicals, which explains why the coin has rallied in the past few weeks. It has formed a cup and handle chart pattern, which is made up of a horizontal line and a rounded bottom. It moved above the upper side of this pattern this week, clearing a crucial resistance level. The price target of a C&H pattern is established by calculating the depth of the cup, which is 55%. One then measures the same distance from the upper side of the cup, and establishes the target at $31.60. The value of LINK has also formed a golden pennant pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a triangle. Therefore, the coin will likely continue rising as bulls target the initial target the year-to-date high of $22.85. A break above that level will point to more gains to the C&H target at $31.60. Chainlink Price Chart The Chainlink price forecast bullish view will become invalid if the coin drops below the key support at $17, the lower side of the pennant’s triangle point. If this happens, the mean reversion could see it drop to the 200 EMA at $13.29.

In a post on X, Young Ju explained that most of the trading volume for altcoins is tied to stablecoins and fiat pairs. According to him, rotation from Bitcoin no longer defines the alt season, a major departure from previous bull runs. According to Cryptoquant data, the aggregated trading volume for stablecoin pairs has reached peak levels this year, while the trading volume for Bitcoin pairs is down. Young Ju said : “Alt season is no longer defined by asset rotation from #Bitcoin. Stablecoin liquidity better explains the altcoin markets.” His comments capture the significant difference between the current and previous bull markets. Historically, the alt season, which refers to when these tokens record a surge in value and outshine Bitcoin, usually happens due to investors rotating capital out of Bitcoin into other cryptocurrencies, the alternatives. Stablecoin liquidity now defines altcoin markets better – CryptoQuant However, this has not happened, leading many market observers to question why alternative cryptos have not entered their season. Young Ju now believes that investors need to pay attention to stablecoins liquidity instead of focusing on capital rotation out of Bitcoin. Institutional interest in Bitcoin ends capital rotation to altcoins Young Ju had previously explained why the altcoin season is delayed. According to him, institutional investors and spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are driving the current Bitcoin rally, and this group does not buy on exchanges nor do they care much for Bitcoin alternatives. He said: “Unlike crypto exchange users, institutional investors and ETF buyers have no intention of rotating their assets from Bitcoin to altcoins. Moreover, as they operate outside of crypto exchanges, asset rotation becomes inherently less feasible.” The limited exposure of these institutional investors to altcoins or exchanges means that retail investors will likely be responsible for any alts season in this bull run. The analyst said: “For altcoins to reach a new all-time high market capitalization, they will require a significant influx of fresh capital to crypto exchanges. The altcoin market cap below its previous ATH indicates reduced fresh liquidity from new exchange users.” Since retail is unlikely to drive any major Bitcoin rally in the future, altcoins would have to find other ways to attract liquidity apart from relying on the Bitcoin rotation. Altcoin season might be here already While questions remain about when the alts season will start, some analysts believe that it has already started with retail selectively picking its winners. Podcaster CryptoVizArt noted that it has already started and might have even peaked with Solana. However, Young Ju did not agree fully with this opinion, noting that the altcoin season has started for some but not others. “Altseason has started for a few major altcoins, but not for others, imo. The total altcoin market cap is still below its all-time high.” Others also share this view. Crypto trader CryptoFeras noted that alt season usually happens toward the final stages of the bull cycle, and this is likely what will happen now, as is the case in every other bull cycle. The analyst explained the reason for this, noting: “Once BTC goes parabolic, media start pushing the narrative, a new wave of retail buyers will come, and as usual, they will never buy the “expensive BTC” they will be buying altcoins. that was always the case in all cycles.” Still, one coin that is currently experiencing its season is Ripple (XRP). The token has been up over 20% in the last 24 hours, peaking at $2.491. It has leapfrogged Solana in terms of market cap. For a few hours today, it even became the third biggest crypto asset, temporarily taking USDT’s position behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. Altcoin market cap breakout suggests altseason is coming – Ash Crypto Meanwhile, several other analysts believe alts season is not here yet and will happen in the next few months. Crypto trader Ash Crypto noted that the market cap breakout has finally happened, and the last time it did, alts market cap increased by 1000% in seven months.

Where could the bounces happen?",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2024/12/major-altcoins-eth-sol-and-bnb-on-the-way-down-where-could-the-bounces-happen,"As Bitcoin continues to head lower on its own downward trajectory, the major altcoins are following suit. What are the best potential levels to catch a bounce for Ethereum ($ETH), Solana ($SOL), and Binance Coin ($BNB)? $ETH rejected from massive triangle top Source: TradingView When looking at the $ETH price on the weekly time frame, it can be seen that a rejection has just taken place at the top trendline of the huge triangle that $ETH has been in since late 2021. That said, the price has been down and touched the bottom of the triangle, which coincided with the 0.618 Fibonacci, thus a bullish bounce. $ETH bounce or further downside? Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $ETH shows the price traversing upwards in a wedge pattern. The price is currently deciding whether to bounce from the bottom of the wedge, which also coincides with the 0.236 Fibonacci ( a very bullish bounce should it happen), or perhaps to fall through the bottom of the wedge and head for one of the lower Fibonacci levels. Any of these levels would likely signal a bullish bounce. Prices can be taken from the chart above. If the price fell all the way down and below $3,000, this would potentially negate the upside trend. $SOL heading back down to major horizontal support Source: TradingView The weekly chart for the $SOL price shows that the latest big surge out of the bull flag succeeded in making a new all-time high. Instead of pushing on upwards, the $SOL price is coming down again. This is much healthier for the price overall, and it looks as though the price may come down either to the lesser support at $210, or the major support at $202. This would have the effect of building price structure on top of the bull flag and also support from the 2021 highs. $SOL lower low or bounce? Source: TradingView The 4-hour chart for $SOL shows how the price is rolling over. In fact, the price is currently in danger of making a lower low on this time frame. It could be that the 0.382 Fibonacci does become the bounce level, but a small slip to the downside and below $222 could mean a further drop. The 5.0 Fibonacci lines up with the support at $210, while the 0.618 Fibonacci is just below the major support level of $202. All could be potentially good levels for entering a position. $BNB rejects from top of huge range Source: TradingView The weekly time frame for $BNB is self-explanatory. The price has been in a huge range since early May 2021. The price looks to have rejected from the top of this range currently, and it just remains to be seen where a bounce could take place from. Potential entry for $BNB but set tight stop loss Source: TradingView The 4-hour time frame for $BNB displays an ascending channel which the price is currently traversing within. An excellent place to open a position could potentially be the bottom of the channel, which coincides nicely with the horizontal support at $610. Bear in mind that this strong support could fail, and so a stop loss should be employed. Lower lows below this could signal the end of the uptrend, at least for the short to medium term.

However, the asset fell hard today, and the question remains whether that target will be achieved soon. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart As the daily chart demonstrates, the asset has been breaking through several resistance levels over the past few weeks, paving its way toward the $100K mark. However, the price has yet to reach this level, as the market is moving sideways. With the $90K support level intact, investors could be hopeful that a bullish breakout and rally above the $100K mark would materialize. Yet, if the $90K level gets broken to the downside, a significant pullback toward the $80K area could be expected. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart illustrates the recent BTC price action, as the market has been consolidating inside a symmetrical triangle pattern. These patterns can either be continuation or reversal ones, depending on the direction of the breakout. Therefore, if the market can break above the triangle, a bullish continuation toward and above the $100K mark would be likely. On-Chain Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Exchange Netflow (30-Day Moving Average) It is possible to analyze the accumulation and distribution of Bitcoin in the spot market using the exchange netflow metric. It measures the net deposits and withdrawals of Bitcoin into and from centralized exchanges. Positive values show distribution, while negative numbers indicate accumulation. As the chart suggests, there have been substantial negative netflows recently, as investors are rapidly accumulating BTC in the hopes of a rally above $100K soon. The 30-day moving average of the BTC netflows has also consistently shown negative values over the past six months. As a result, if the derivatives market does not create an obstacle, the demand in the spot market will likely push the price higher in the coming months.

Despite a recent market correction, analysts remain optimistic about SOL’s potential to hit the $500 mark. The surge is driven by strong bullish sentiment and increasing investor interest, with market experts predicting a breakout fueled by growing adoption and technological advancements. Solana Price Eyes $500 Amid Analyst Insights on Recent Rally Crypto expert tweeted that Solana has surged by 46% this month, but retail investors appear absent from the rally. The data highlights minimal retail trading activity, suggesting that institutional or high-net-worth players may drive the price increase. A shared chart categorizes retail participation levels as neutral, few retail, many retail, and too many retail. During the current rally, SOL’s activity remained mainly in the “neutral” range, a sharp contrast to past bull markets, often driven by heightened retail involvement. Source: X SOL Price Poisoned for Major Rally Solana price shows signs of a potential surge to $500 as bullish momentum sweeps through the cryptocurrency market. BTC’s recent rally above $96,000 has sparked optimism, creating a ripple effect across altcoins. The rally has boosted the performance of leading cryptocurrencies, including ETH, BNB coin, and XRP. Solana stands out due to its increasing traction in decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and the rise of Solana-based meme coins . These developments have fueled investor confidence in the network’s ecosystem. In the past 24 hours, SOL traded between $223 and $239, reflecting market volatility amid broader upward trends. Despite a recent pullback, Solana remains 14.41% below its all-time high of $263.83, recorded on November 23, 2024. At the time of writing, the SOL price is trading at $226 with a slight decrease of 4%.

Ethereum price’s YTD performance is lackluster, stands at 45%, and is well below BTC.

Can BTC Extend November Gains & End 2024 on Positive Note? Industry veterans’ speculation of a bull run post-US elections was right, and Bitcoin is likely to end November 2024 on a positive note.

Key Bitcoin Upgrades With a market cap of $1.93 trillion, it is necessary for the network to remain secure, decentralized, and scalable. This is possible by upgrading the Bitcoin network regularly. Here are some notable upgrades the Bitcoin network has received or planned to receive since its inception in 2009.

This remarkable rally represents a 120% increase in value over the month. Currently, Pepe is trading at $0.00002032, reflecting a minor pullback of 3% from recent highs. The weekly price chart highlights the formation of a bullish engulfing pattern, signaling a continuation of upward momentum for Pepe Coin price. The bullish pennant measures approximately 1,858%.

The bullish outlook would be invalidated if the Pepe Coin price falls below the pennant’s lower trendline, closing decisively below $0.00001650.

However, with the market showing signs of overheating, a consolidation phase is anticipated in the near term. XRP Analysis By Shayan The Weekly Chart Ripple has shown an impressive surge, climbing over 100% since last week, pushing past the $2 resistance level, and hitting $2.5 for the first time since January 2018. This strong upward movement signals a dominant buying presence in the market. The price action reflects extreme optimism, but the RSI has surged into overbought territory, suggesting the market is overheated. Such conditions often precede a period of consolidation or corrective retracements, as buyers may need time to digest the gains before pushing the price higher again. In the mid-term, the key support level to watch is the $2 threshold, which has now turned into crucial support after being reclaimed as resistance during the recent surge. A pullback toward this level would be healthy for the market, offering a chance for buyers to regroup before a potential continuation of the uptrend. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, the bullish structure is clear, with higher highs and higher lows. Ripple has successfully reclaimed several key resistance levels, including its previous ATH of $2, before surging to the new $2.5 mark. The asset recently broke above the upper trendline of an ascending channel, further emphasizing buyers’ dominance. However, the RSI on this shorter timeframe shows a notable bearish divergence, signaling that a correction is likely in the near term. With its large number of leveraged positions, the overheated futures market increases the likelihood of a liquidation cascade if the price experiences a sharp decline. This suggests that while the mid-term outlook remains bullish, short-term consolidation or a pullback is expected, potentially leading to heightened volatility.

With Bitcoin dominance falling and altcoins registering massive gains, the altcoin season might just be around the corner. In a latest development, the Ava Labs CEO, Emin Gün Sirer has revealed that Ava Labs is in talks with the US administration.

XRP price rallies against the backdrop of legal victories in Ripple’s favor and speculations that CEO Brad Garlinghouse will be the top pick for the rumored “Crypto Czar” position under Trump. Notably, XRP has recently also flipped Solana to get to the top three cryptocurrencies. AVAX is currently trading at $46.34, up over 4% in the last 24 hours. AVAX Price Rallies Aligning with the optimistic event mentioned above, AVAX price soared roughly 5% over the past day and is sitting at $47.17. Its 24-hour trading volume soared over 200% to $2.07 billion. Market enthusiasts are extensively eyeing the coin for further gains, given Trump is set to resume his role the next year. Notably, the Ichimoku Cloud signals a bullish outlook for Avalanche (AVAX), with key support levels at $44.27 and $42.25 providing a strong foundation for upward momentum. The transaction volumes have surged for AVAX, reaching $566 million in November before stabilizing at $250 million. Additionally, a 5.52% decrease in zero-balance addresses over seven days indicates that funds are re-entering circulation, further supporting market confidence. Outlook remains positive Despite the bullish indicators, AVAX faces challenges. The overbought conditions suggest a potential pause or retracement in its current rally.

Helium Mobile (MOBILE) rallied to a seven-month high of $0.00257 on Dec. 2 during early Asian trading hours before settling at $0.001916, still marking a 78.7% increase over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. The altcoin’s market cap was seated at $199.2 million when writing, while its daily trading volume was up almost 10x, hovering over $193 million. Helium Mobile’s recent rally aligns with a sharp rise in Helium Data Credits (DC) usage. These credits, which are fixed-value tokens used for data transfer on the Helium Mobile network, saw a significant increase in burning activity. According to data from Dune, daily DC burned jumped by over 30%, rising from $10,606 on Nov. 31 to $13,868 on Dec. 1. Helium offers a crypto rewards program that allows users and Hotspot operators to earn IOT or MOBILE tokens to help drive its network growth. Both of these tokens can be swapped for HNT, which is the primary utility token used in the Helium Network . One reason MOBILE’s price could be rising is that traders are taking advantage of an arbitrage opportunity with HNT. According to a community member, the current HNT to MOBILE swap rate is around 5,000:1, which is significantly better than the expected final rate of 7,700:1, as outlined in Helium Improvement Proposal 138. This could prompt many investors to buy MOBILE and then exchange it for HNT to capitalize on the difference—driving demand for MOBILE in the short term and indirectly boosting demand for HNT as well.

Notably, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) demonstrated a remarkable resurgence, boasting an impressive 57.8% increase in monthly sales, signaling renewed interest and activity in this vibrant market. On the other hand, Solana’s meme coin launchpad, Pump.fun, encountered some challenges, particularly after the disabling of its livestream feature, which may have impacted user engagement and overall performance. Pump.fun’s Revenue Plummets Amid Livestream Shutdown Following Violent Content Reports Solana meme coin launchpad Pump.fun has experienced a sharp decline in weekly revenue following the controversial disabling of its livestream feature. The move came in response to reports of harmful and violent content being broadcast on its platform, raising concerns over the company’s moderation policies and long-term viability. Pump.fun started November on a strong note, showing robust revenue growth fueled by the surging popularity of its meme coin launchpad. According to DefiLlama , the platform generated $33.83 million in revenue during the week of Nov. 18–24, marking a staggering 60% increase from the previous week and an almost 400% surge from the beginning of the month. However, the platform’s revenue trajectory took a dramatic turn the following week. Between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, Pump.fun recorded just $11.31 million in revenue, representing a 66% week-over-week decline. This abrupt reversal coincided with the removal of its livestream feature , a decision that has sparked mixed reactions from the community. Pump.fun’s livestream feature was initially lauded for fostering user engagement and providing a dynamic environment for promoting new tokens. However, it quickly became a flashpoint for controversy. On Nov. 25, troubling incidents were reported by community members and safety professionals, drawing widespread attention to the platform. One particularly alarming incident involved a streamer who threatened to commit suicide if their coin did not achieve a specific market cap. This prompted Beau, a safety project manager for Pudgy Penguins, to tag Pump.fun on X, urging immediate action to disable the stream and provide support to the individual involved. Other users reported equally disturbing content, including threats of violence against animals and schools. These reports prompted swift action from Pump.fun, which announced on Nov. 25 that it had indefinitely paused its livestream feature to address the growing concerns. In a community note, Pump.fun acknowledged the gravity of the situation, stating that the events on its livestreams had “caused concern” and that it was working to implement proper moderation tools before reinstating the feature. Legal and Regulatory Implications The fallout from the livestream controversy has extended beyond the realm of community criticism, drawing attention from legal experts and regulatory bodies. Yuriy Brisov, a partner at Digital and Analogue Partners, described the situation as “a legitimate reason for a criminal investigation and civil lawsuits.” His comments serve as a warning of the potential legal ramifications for Pump.fun, which may face scrutiny for its failure to prevent harmful content from being broadcast. Mikko Ohtamaa, co-founder of Trading Strategy, echoed similar concerns, suggesting that the platform could either face immediate closure by authorities or eventual shutdown once regulators grasp the complexities of the situation. These statements shed some light on the precarious position of Pump.fun as it navigates the aftermath of its livestream debacle. The decision to disable the livestream feature has elicited varied responses from the Pump.fun community and the broader crypto industry. While some have praised the platform for taking swift action to address the issue, others have criticized the move as reactionary and indicative of deeper systemic problems. The incident has also reignited discussions about the ethical responsibilities of platforms in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Critics argue that Pump.fun’s reliance on user-generated content without robust moderation mechanisms reflects a broader challenge for DeFi platforms, which often prioritize innovation over regulatory compliance and safety. Despite its recent setbacks, Pump.fun remains a significant player in the Solana ecosystem, and its ability to recover from this crisis will likely hinge on how effectively it addresses the root causes of the controversy. Implementing comprehensive moderation tools and establishing clear community guidelines will be critical steps in restoring trust and resuming growth. The platform has also hinted at future developments, including the potential launch of its own token and a new trading terminal. These initiatives could help Pump.fun regain momentum, provided it can navigate the regulatory scrutiny and community concerns stemming from the livestream controversy. The Pump.fun saga serves as a cautionary tale for the constantly evolving DeFi space, highlighting the challenges of balancing innovation with ethical responsibility and regulatory compliance. As the platform works to rebuild its reputation and revenue, its actions in the coming months will be closely watched by both its users and industry stakeholders. For now, Pump.fun faces the daunting task of demonstrating that it can grow responsibly while addressing the complex issues that have arisen from its rapid ascent. Whether it can rise to the occasion remains to be seen, but the outcome will undoubtedly have implications for the broader DeFi ecosystem. NFT Market Rebounds: November Sales Volume Surges 57.8% Amid Broader Crypto Recovery While Pump.fun’s revenue took a dive, the non-fungible token ( NFT ) market demonstrated a robust recovery in November, with monthly sales volume climbing by 57.8% to $562 million. This marks the highest sales volume since May 2024, signaling renewed investor interest in digital collectibles after months of declining momentum. Data from CryptoSlam reveals that November’s sales represented a significant rebound from October, positioning NFTs on an upward trajectory for the first time since March 2024. While the $562 million in sales is a positive development, it still pales in comparison to the $1.6 billion recorded during the market's 2024 peak in March. Between March and October, the NFT market faced a prolonged slump, with monthly sales volumes steadily declining to levels not seen since 2021. This resurgence could mark the beginning of a broader market recovery, driven by an increase in blockchain activity and heightened interest in prominent NFT collections. Among the standout performers, CryptoPunks solidified its position as a leading NFT collection, with a remarkable rise in floor price and sales volume. Data from DefiLlama shows that the CryptoPunks floor price jumped from 26.3 Ether (ETH) on Nov. 1 to 39.7 ETH by the end of the month—an increase of 52%. At current market prices, this rise translates to an approximate valuation of $147,000 per CryptoPunk. In terms of sales, CryptoSlam reported over $49 million in 30-day sales volume for the collection, reflecting a staggering 392% month-on-month increase. The number of sales transactions also surged to 388 in November, up 213% from October. Another collection that captured significant attention in November was Pudgy Penguins. The collection’s monthly sales volume reached $16 million, representing a 262% increase compared to October. According to DefiLlama , Pudgy Penguins’ floor price climbed from 8.7 ETH on Nov. 1 to 13 ETH by the end of November, equating to a 49% gain and a current valuation of approximately $48,000 per token. The rise in both floor price and sales volume suggests growing demand for this collection, further emphasizing the resurgence of interest in blue-chip NFTs. The recovery in NFT sales was not limited to individual collections, as top blockchain networks also posted impressive numbers in November. Ethereum maintained its dominance in the NFT ecosystem, accounting for over $216 million in sales volume, a 12% increase from the previous month. Bitcoin emerged as the fastest-growing blockchain for NFTs in November, with sales volume soaring by 99.44% to $186 million. The significant jump suggests the adoption of Ordinals, a technology that facilitates NFTs on the Bitcoin network, is increasing. Other blockchain platforms, including Solana, Mythos Chain, Immutable, Polygon, and BNB Chain, collectively recorded $162.9 million in sales. These networks continue to provide alternative ecosystems for NFT trading, appealing to users seeking diverse options beyond Ethereum and Bitcoin. Renewed Optimism in the NFT Market The NFT market’s resurgence comes amid broader recovery trends in the cryptocurrency sector. Rising digital asset prices and increased blockchain activity have helped boost investor confidence, drawing attention back to NFTs as a speculative and cultural asset class. Market analysts attribute this rebound to several factors, including the improving macroeconomic environment, a surge in new NFT-related projects, and heightened interest in utility-focused NFTs, such as gaming and metaverse assets. The performance of flagship collections like CryptoPunks and Pudgy Penguins has also played a pivotal role in reinforcing market sentiment. While November’s recovery is promising, the NFT market still faces challenges that could dampen its growth. Regulatory uncertainties, market volatility, and the high cost of transactions on certain blockchains remain key concerns for participants. Additionally, with sales volumes still far below their 2024 peak, sustained growth will require innovation and broader adoption of NFTs beyond speculative trading. Market participants are increasingly looking for NFTs that offer tangible utility, such as access to exclusive content, experiences, or digital rights management.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-02 13:28:26

The Saudi Central Bank (SAMA) now holds $144 billion in US Treasuries, which account for 35% of its total foreign assets as of the latest data in October. This is the largest share since February 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic first rattled global markets. Despite this surge in US bond holdings, Saudi Arabia’s total foreign reserves have plunged to $411 billion, marking their lowest point since February 2020. The drop reflects a mix of economic strategy and fiscal necessity, with massive withdrawals directed toward the country’s sovereign wealth fund and domestic government spending. Shifting reserves: A tactical play In 2020, SAMA’s US Treasury holdings made up over 37% of its foreign reserves before dropping sharply. The decline came after a $40 billion transfer to the Public Investment Fund (PIF) as the government moved to capitalize on global market chaos. It tapped those reserves to buy discounted assets during a period of investor panic. The timing of this shift is impossible to ignore. Donald Trump’s return to the White House could rejuvenate Saudi Arabia’s political and economic alignment with the US. Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who enjoyed a close relationship with Trump during his first term, appears to be positioning Saudi Arabia to strengthen ties with the incoming administration. Earlier this month, Yasir Al Rumayyan, the head of the PIF and a trusted ally of Prince Mohammed, was spotted sitting next to Trump at a UFC event in New York. That was a public display of camaraderie that could mean the kingdom is ready to recalibrate its US relationships under a familiar political ally. Treasury yields surge: Investors await labor data Treasury yields edged higher on Monday as investors braced for key labor and manufacturing data set to drop later this week. The 10-year Treasury yield ticked up by 1 basis point to hit 4.207%, while the 2-year yield climbed 2 basis points, landing at 4.192%. On Friday, the 10-year yield had dipped to its lowest point since late October, catching some attention before this week’s movements. For context, a basis point is 0.01%, and yields move in the opposite direction of bond prices. Right now, investors are laser-focused on upcoming labor data, hoping to gauge the US economy’s pulse. On Wednesday, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for October will drop, giving numbers on job openings, hires, layoffs, and quits. It’s a solid first look at how the labor market is holding up. Then, the big one: Friday’s November jobs report. Analysts are betting on a gain of 177,500 jobs for the month, based on FactSet’s consensus, which would be a big jump from October’s slim 12,000 jobs. Unemployment is also expected to inch up slightly to 4.2% from 4.1%, according to the same estimates.

Michael Saylor Urges Microsoft to Invest in Bitcoin: “The Best Asset You Can Have” Addressing Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and the company's board of directors, Saylor argued that Bitcoin represents “the greatest digital transformation of the 21st century.” In a three-minute presentation shared online, Saylor highlighted Bitcoin's potential to reshape corporate finance and increase Microsoft's enterprise value. “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next wave of technology, and that wave is Bitcoin,” Saylor said. “It makes sense for Microsoft to buy and hold Bitcoin rather than buy back stocks or hold bonds.” Saylor criticized Microsoft’s financial strategy of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, arguing that such moves increase risks for shareholders. Instead, he recommended Bitcoin as a superior alternative without counterparty risk. Saylor claimed that if Microsoft converted its cash flows, dividends, buybacks, and debt into Bitcoin, the company's stock price could increase by $584 per share, adding $4.9 trillion to its enterprise value by 2034. Microsoft shares closed at $423.46 on Friday, up 0.11% on the day and 3.67% over the past month, according to Google Finance. MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Strategy MicroStrategy, under Saylor’s leadership, has been a pioneer in institutional Bitcoin adoption. Since it began accumulating in 2020, the company has amassed 386,700 BTC, worth over $37.7 billion at current prices. The firm’s aggressive Bitcoin strategy has paid off, with shares up 465% year to date. Saylor's recent presentation to Microsoft underscores his belief that Bitcoin is a transformative asset for large companies. While Microsoft has not publicly commented on Saylor's recommendation, the proposal highlights Bitcoin's growing influence in corporate strategy discussions. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin Development Company MicroStrategy (MSTR) is now the owner of nearly 2% of all the bitcoin (BTC) that will ever be created after again adding to its holdings of the token. The firm Monday morning disclosed the purchase of 15,400 bitcoin over the week ended Dec. 1 for $15.4 billion, or an average price of $95,976 each. That brings its holdings to 402,100 tokens worth $38.2 billion at bitcoin's current price of $95,000. The company's overall average purchase price is $58,263. This most recent buy was funded with share sales under the company's existing at-the-market program, according to the disclosure. Executive Chairman Michael Saylor once again on Sunday teased the Monday announcement. MicroStrategy's 402,100 tokens amount to more than 1.9% of the 21 million bitcoin that can ever be created. Other developments Underway is the process for rebalancing the Nasdaq 100 and one discussion point is whether MicroStrategy will be included in the re-figured index. An announcement on inclusion is due to take place on Dec. 13. Saylor also on Sunday posted that he gave a 3-minute presentation to the Microsoft (MSFT) board regarding bitcoin investment as a diversification strategy.

However, the landscape could soon change, as investors seem primed to start inserting fresh funds into the market. BTC to Head North Soon? CryptoPotato reported BTC’s price drop that drove the asset to a multi-day low of under $95,000 after the relatively quiet weekend. It cost over-leveraged traders dearly as the total liquidations have shot up to almost $550 million on a daily scale, with longs responsible for the lion’s share. However, there are certain indicators that suggest BTC’s impressive rally that started after Trump’s victory is not over. Aside from the relative unrealized profit metric, which still shows that the market has not reached an overheated state yet, a recent CryptoQuant report hints at more buying power prepared to be discharged. The ERC-20 stablecoin reserves on Binance have reached a new all-time high of over $28 billion. This means that the capital sitting on the sidelines waiting for proper opportunities to enter the market on the world’s largest crypto exchange has never been so much. Binance’s role is highly significant due to its dominance over the industry. The report depicts the exchange as a “liquidity hub, attracting traders and institutions for stablecoin transactions, storage, and trading.” As such, the massive amounts of stablecoins sitting there amid a market-wide retracement could be the beginning of yet another rally: “Market Sentiment: Rising reserves indicate renewed confidence, increased trading activity, and staking.” – reads the report. Binance Stablecoin Reserves. Source: CryptoQuant $120K Soon? Popular crypto YouTuber Crypto Rover weighed in on BTC’s potential during this cycle and outlined a target of $120,000 should the asset’s bull run continue.

As the chart below demonstrates, these scarce occurrences have led to immediate and continuous price surges from the asset, which Jelle described as – “price generally pumps for months on end.” Monthly breakouts don’t come around very often.

While the trader’s sentiments for some of the tokens remain uncertain, for other’s it’s just bullish. In the meantime, some of the primitive tokens, like Cardano & Solana, are facing tough times and are expected to lose more gains in the coming days. With this, the bulls may get a good entry as the prices of ADA & SOL continue to remain under bullish influence in the long term. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis Cardano is testing some crucial support levels, losing which the token is believed to undergo a hefty 15% pullback. The ADA price has begun to swell after prolonged consolidation, and hence it can be assumed that the market participants may have extracted profits after a pretty long wait. However, the price is expected to trigger a strong rebound after the selling pressure fades off with lower selling volume. As seen in the above chart, the ADA price is trading within an ascending triangle in the short term and is trying hard to defend the ascending support. With this, the token has entered a decisive phase and a close below $1.10 signals a trend shift, while a drop under $1.03 could confirm a bearish breakdown to $0.88. However, the technicals remain in bullish favor, which suggests the bulls to enter the ring anytime from now and revamp a strong ascending trend towards a new ATH. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis The Solana price was expected to be one of the most dominant altcoins during the ongoing bullish action, with the price targets above $300 in the short term and above $500 in the long term. However, a major shift in market sentiments appears to have occurred, according to which the price is now feared to plunge back to $200 if bulls fail to defend the support at $220. The SOL price is now testing the neckline of the head and shoulder pattern, which is flashing massive bearish signals. Besides, the price is trading between the base & conversion lines of the Ichimoku cloud, and it appears that the levels are heading towards a bearish crossover, flipping the cloud to bearish and triggering a sell signal. The descending RSI also validates a bearish claim along with a major drop in volume. Therefore, the prices of Cardano & Solana are heading towards the lower support by losing nearly 15% of its value. If the bulls fail to hold the levels, more bearish action may occur.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-02 13:39:17

Bitcoin has more than doubled, while smaller meme coins like Dogwifhat and Popcat have minted many millionaires. So, let us explore some of the 5 crypto to buy this December for a great retirement. Best crypto to buy for a good retirement While Bitcoin is the best-known cryptocurrency, many others make a good investment. When looking at coins to buy and hold, it is good to look at those with a good staking yield and strong momentum. Mantra | OM Mantra is one of the best coins to buy and hold. It has a strong staking yield of almost 30%. It also has a strong momentum as it has surged by more than 11,400% from its lowest point in January. On the daily chart below, the coin has formed a falling wedge chart pattern. This pattern is made up of two falling and converging trendlines. It often leads to a strong bullish breakout in most instances. Mantra has also formed a bullish flag chart pattern, which is made up of a vertical line followed by a consolidation. Therefore, there are odds that the Mantra price will stage a strong bullish breakout, and possibly jump to $10 soon. Mantra Price Chart Aureal One | DLUME Aurel One is a top cryptocurrency that offers a good opportunity for investors. It has attracted thousands of investors in its presale. Part of the reason for this is that it offers an easy way to generate a return since the DLUME price is rising per stage. DLUME token was trading at $0.0007 and will list at $0.005. As such, anyone who buys it now can expect a 614% return. In contrast, the S&P 500 index has risen by less than 300% in the last decade. Aureal One is in the fast-growing industry of the metaverse and gaming, which are expected to do well over time. Polkadot | DOT Polkadot is another good crypto to buy because of its strong momentum and its strong staking yield of 11.82%. This yield means that an investor with $10,000 will receive about $1,100 annually. Polkadot coin has also formed a golden cross pattern as the 50-day and 200-day moving averages have crossed each other. It has also moved slightly above the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level. DOT price was trading at the weak, stop & reverse point of the Murrey Math Lines. This means that it has more room to go to get the extreme overshoot at $11.91, which is about 27% above the current level. Polkadot price chart Cosmos | ATOM Cosmos is another popular cryptocurrency to buy and hold. On the daily chart, it is about to form a golden cross, a few weeks after it completed the multi-month falling wedge pattern. A falling wedge is made up of two converging trendlines and is a popular bullish reversal pattern. With many altcoins eying their year-to-date highs, ATOM price could hit $14.51, which is about 70% above the current level. Cosmos is also a high yielder, with a staking return of 20%. Cosmos Price Chart Celestia | TIA Celestia is another good cryptocurrency to buy for retirement. It has a leading market share in the modular data industry, and is 65% below its all-time high. On the daily chart, the TIA token has just made a breakout after consolidating in the past few months. That is a sign that Celestia is about to make a bullish breakout that could push it higher to $12.46, its highest level on April 20 and 65% above the current level. Celestia has a staking yield of at least 10%. Celestia price chart Conclusion On The Best Cryptocurrency To Buy These cryptocurrencies combine strong techicals and high staking rewards. Staking is where an investor delegates his tokens to secure a network and then earns a reward every month. For example, a 20% yield is much higher than that of the popular Schwab US Dividend ETF (SCHD), which yields about 3%.

Notably, the firm revealed on Monday that it intends to offer a private offering worth $700 million in 0% convertible senior notes due 2031, primarily to qualified institutional buyers. This mover, riding the heels of the miner’s colossal buying witnessed previously, has in turn echoed significant market optimism surrounding the flagship crypto. Bitcoin Miner MARA To Raise $700M Sparking Market Discussions In an official press release dated December 2, MARA announced a proposed private offering of 0% convertible notes worth $700 million for institutional buyers. Further, the Bitcoin miner announced that it would grant the initial purchasers of the notes an option to purchase an additional $105 million aggregate principal amount of the notes within a 13-day period, beginning and including the date of issue. This enhanced market offering, in turn, magnetized institutional buyers across the broader American landscape. However, the mining firm also revealed that the offering remains subject to market and other conditions, “and there can be no assurance as to whether, when or on what terms the offering may be completed.” Moreover, these notes will be unsecured, which is in line with MARA’s senior obligation. Besides, it’s noteworthy that all of the proceeds will be used primarily to acquire Bitcoin, with some proceeds also being used to repurchase the 2026 convertible notes up to $50 million. Overall, the miner’s massive buying could significantly aid the BTC price amid a bullish Q4 crypto market, offering heightened buying pressure. Simultaneously, it’s also worth mentioning that MARA recently completed its $1 billion private offering in another BTC purchase saga. BTC Mirrors Bullishness Amid Massive Buying Meanwhile, BTC price today slipped nearly 2% reaching $95,685, indicating a muted market interest. The flagship crypto’s 24-hour low and high were $94,820.20 and $98,152.60, respectively. Nevertheless, it’s worth noting that the coin’s monthly chart indicates gains worth 38%, underscoring a bullish momentum for the token. Notably, the coin even neared the much-awaited $100K mark amid this bull cycle, solidifying investor optimism in the wake of the massive buying globally. Further, in light of the coin’s run near $100K, CoinGape Media reported the same Bitcoin miner to have bagged 5771 BTC, underlining the asset’s potential. Crypto market participants continue to keep the flagship crypto on their radars amid bullish events unfolding across the broader sector.

37135371,https://coinpedia.org/?p=388088,1733147352,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Can Avalanche (AVAX) Break $50 and Rally to $169?,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/can-avalanche-avax-break-50-and-rally-to-169/,"The post Can Avalanche (AVAX) Break $50 and Rally to $169? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Avalanche (AVAX) is turning heads again. Its price has jumped an impressive 9.45% in the past 24 hours, but the buzz isn’t just about numbers. Behind the scenes, rumors of political connections and comparisons to Ripple (XRP) are fueling big hopes. Could this be the moment AVAX finally breaks through its limits and sets a new all-time high? Let’s break it all down. Trading Momentum Has Traders Watching Closely AVAX is now priced at $48.09, and it’s not just the 9.45% spike that has people talking. Its trading volume has exploded by a jaw-dropping 233.35%, climbing to $2.22 billion in just a day. That’s pretty wild and cements AVAX as the 10th-largest cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap. But it’s not all smooth sailing. The $50 mark is proving to be a tough barrier. Technical indicators are sending mixed signals—moving averages are looking bullish, with the 20, 50, and 100-day lines crossing above the 200-day average. But here’s the catch: the RSI is sitting at 75.87, putting AVAX in the overbought zone. That could mean a short-term pause before the next leg up. Profitability Stats According to the data by IntoTheBlock, 81% of the AVAX investors are in profit at the current price. That’s a pretty solid indication of positive investor sentiment. However, 16% investors are still waiting to enter the profit zone while 2% are at break even level. This clearly suggests how confident investors are in regards to Avalanche and they are holding strong especially looking at the recent surge. But some may still be waiting for a breakout past $50 to book profits or buy more. Is Ripple Leading the Way for Avalanche? What’s adding to the hype is how Avalanche’s rise seems to mirror Ripple’s recent success. Ripple (XRP) gained major traction after legal wins and hints of deeper collaboration with U.S. regulators. Now, Avalanche might be charting a similar path. Emin Gün Sirer, the CEO of Ava Labs, recently hinted at quiet discussions with the incoming Trump administration, which is being seen as crypto-friendly. In his words, Avalanche tends to deliver “results, in total Avalanche fashion.” This kind of political backing could boost AVAX’s chances of thriving in the U.S., much like Ripple has benefited from its own regulatory clarity. Yes, of course we are. You will not see us parade our political connections in social media. You'll just suddenly see results, in total Avalanche fashion. Plan accordingly. https://t.co/98tp1SR2QY — egs9000 (@el33th4xor) December 2, 2024 The comparison has traders excited. If AVAX can ride this wave of optimism and secure its own breakthroughs, the potential upside is huge. What’s Next for Avalanche? Here’s what everyone’s asking: can AVAX finally smash past $50 and aim for $169, as Fibonacci projections suggest? The answer might depend on whether it sustains its current momentum and how these political developments unfold. If Avalanche’s talks with U.S. regulators deliver meaningful results, it could cement its position as a blockchain leader. While short-term pullbacks are possible, the long-term picture looks promising. The big question is, how high can Avalanche climb—and how soon?",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,AVAX|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-02 13:49:12

With its $3.148 trillion market cap, Microsoft is currently the third most valuable globally, trailing behind only Apple and Nvidia Corp. The “Crypto Renaissance” Saylor further told the Microsoft board that public and political support for Bitcoin is skyrocketing and that there is a “crypto renaissance”, citing pro-crypto commitments made by President-elect Donald Trump and novel Bitcoin investment vehicles introduced on Wall Street by prominent companies. “Do the right thing for your customers, employees, shareholders, the country, the world, and your legacy,” Saylor concluded, “adopt Bitcoin”. Notably, the price of Bitcoin has spiked 130% so far this year — roughly 37% over the last month alone — to touch the underbelly of the highly-coveted $100,000 mark. Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy has acquired roughly 386,700 BTC for a total of $22 billion since late 2020. Its BTC stash is now valued at $36.8 billion, with Bitcoin priced at $95,400. MicroStrategy’s shares are up 465% year-to-date alongside the value of its Bitcoin stockpile as it continues to leverage its position and buy up more BTC. This is part of MicroStrategy’s bold “21/21” strategy announced in October, which seeks to raise $42 billion through equal amounts of stock and bond sales through 2027 to boost its Bitcoin holdings.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News|MICROSOFT,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-02 13:58:49

The wallet will allow users to safeguard and manage their crypto on over 2,300+ blockchains. Users can now pay for gas fees using $USDT or $CTRL for all transactions. Ctrl , the one-for-all wallet solution, announced the launch of its browser extension wallet, in a move set to simplify self-custody for users across 2,300+ blockchains. The platform is built to work with all major blockchains including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cosmos, Solana, THORchain etc., breathing fresh air to managing and securing digital assets. The Ctrl browser extension wallet simplifies self-custody by consolidating all assets within a single, intuitive platform. It makes it easy to connect to DApps, swap tokens cross-chain, aggregate one's portfolio, and even uncover forgotten funds. The wallet has an easy setup routine that allows users to sign up using their email or social accounts or a passphrase for more advanced crypto users without sacrificing the security of users’ funds. Speaking on the latest innovation, Emile Dubié, Co-Founder and CEO of Ctrl stated the goal for his company is to “make self-custody accessible to everyone” and promote mass adoption of crypto globally. “Our extension wallet is making self-custody accessible to everyone around the world,” Dubié stated. “Our team is committed to creating a wallet that empowers users to control their assets and take advantage of all the opportunities in crypto.” Founded in 2020 and previously named XDEFI, Ctrl has grown into one of the most reliable self-custody wallet solutions, rivalling Brave, Metamask and other top wallets. The wallet provider allows users to manage their digital assets, execute token swaps, and connect to thousands of DApps while ensuring the highest levels of security and efficiency. For existing XDEFI Wallet users, their accounts and funds will automatically migrate to Ctrl Wallet, allowing them to instantly benefit from the extension’s advanced features. Consolidating Gas Fees And Cross-Chain Swaps The competitive advantage that the Ctrl browser extension wallet claims to have is the introduction of the Gas Tank, aiming at solving the pressure point of gas fees. The Gas Tank allows users to pay all on-chain fees with a single balance of $USDC or $CTRL, no matter the blockchain. By eliminating the need to hold multiple tokens for gas fees, Ctrl Wallet provides a smoother, more efficient experience across networks. On the launch of the Gas Tank, Emile Dubié stated: “The Gas Tank is a game-changer for self-custody. Our users can now interact cross-chain without the hassle of managing different gas tokens. This launch represents a significant step forward in making self-custody as user-friendly as possible.” Notwithstanding the new wallet will also include several features that ease the usability and management of funds on the wallet. First, users will have a unified portfolio view to enhance ease of use, giving users a single, aggregated dashboard to manage holdings across multiple accounts and blockchains. This view not only allows users to keep track of their assets effortlessly but also makes it possible to rediscover funds they may have forgotten. Additionally, the dashboard will also allow users to easily locate assets spread across different blockchains, platforms, or DApp accounts. Every account and platform linked to the wallet’s seed phrase and hidden tokens on custom networks will be shown on the dashboard. Finally, the browser extension wallet will also introduce cross-chain swaps, removing the need for bridges or third-party applications. Ctrl Wallet provides a solution for this by enabling cross-chain swaps directly within the wallet. With support for major blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche, Ctrl Wallet allows users to swap tokens across ecosystems seamlessly. Integrated routing providers ensure they get competitive rates without the need for external tools. The recent developments on Ctrl Wallet have seen rapid adoption rates for the self-custody solution, reaching a milestone of over half a million users and becoming a top five multi-ecosystem wallet with the highest ratings on the Google Chrome Store.

Ohio data centers acquired at $500/operating KW, significantly below peers’ $900-$1500 range, boosting ROI. 102% annual increase expected by 2024, reaching 50 EH/s, solidifying MARA’s digital asset dominance. Secures electricity at $0.01/kWh, reducing costs and supporting a 34% return on capital employed (ROCE). $2.5B Bitcoin holding (~28% of market cap) positions MARA for gains but exposes it to volatility. Investment Thesis MARA Holdings, Inc. ( MARA ) is poised for exponential growth, underpinned by its aggressive expansion of compute capacity and strategic acquisitions at industry-leading low multiples. With 1.5 GW of nameplate capacity, 65% of which is owned and operated, MARA achieves unmatched cost control and operational efficiency. The company's acquisition of Ohio data centers at ~$500/Operating KW, far below peers' ~$900-$1500, positions it for superior ROI. A 102% annual increase in compute power by 2024 fortifies its digital asset dominance. Coupled with energy partnerships yielding $0.01/kWh electricity and a 34% ROCE, MARA exemplifies scalability, cost leadership, and capital efficiency in a surging compute market. Expansion of Compute Capacity and Low Acquisition Multiples MARA stock holds valuation support from the company's expansion of compute capacity. Here, the company added 372 megawatts ((MW)) of interconnect-approved capacity across three sites in Ohio in Q3 2024. Additionally, acquiring two operational data centers in Hannibal and Hopedale brings in 222 MW, whereas 122 MW is already operational. These centers will generate 100 MW of remaining approved capacity in 2025. Further, MARA is assembling a new 150 MW facility in Findlay, Ohio (30 MW already operational). These ongoing developments may be online by 2025 and may increase the company's compute capacity and get optimized over time. For 2024, there will be a 102% annual increase in compute capacity to 50 EH per second. MARA Investor Presentation Moreover, MARA's strategy is moving beyond expanding capacity with geographic and operational diversification. The data centers are now across multiple jurisdictions so no single independent system operator ((ISO)) has control >50% of MARA's owned and operated capacity . This strategy minimizes risks from regulatory shifts, system failures, and operational issues within a single ISO. It pushes MARA to leverage multiple energy markets and maximize the potential for business returns. MARA's return on capital employed (ROCE) is now at 34% just behind the tech sector's 43%. Meanwhile, the closest peer yielded 23%. Further, MARA acquired the two data centers in Ohio at a cost of ~$270K per MW of interconnect-approved capacity. This acquisition cost is lower than its publicly traded peers. MARA's turnkey purchase multiple is at ~$500/Operating KW whereas the closest peers are in ~$900-$1500/Operating KW range. The relatively low cost of acquisition indicates MARA is securing valuable assets at attractive prices. With that, MARA may continue to yield high investment once the compute data centers become online and fully operational. By acquiring assets at a low multiple , MARA can have massive operational savings. At the Hopedale data center, MARA projects that ownership may reduce operating costs by up to ~50%. This heavy cut in OpEx will boost the company's bottom line and operational edge obviously. In a capital-intensive industry like data centers, OpEx can burn a major portion of revenue. By reducing its operational footprint and boosting control over its assets, MARA may derive economies of scale to optimize its bottom line. MARA Investor Presentation Additionally, MARA persists in its digital asset compute market lead due to its high scale. In 2024, the company secured ~1 gigawatt (GW) of nameplate capacity through acquisitions and greenfield developments, bringing its consolidated nameplate capacity to ~1.5 GW. 65% of this capacity may be owned and operated by MARA. As a result, this direct control scales up MARA's lead in the digital asset compute and data center sector. How? By owning and operating a majority of its assets, MARA gains a cost edge against the market. Relying on leasing and third-party arrangements brings in additional costs and less operational control. The ownership of such a large portion of its capacity provides MARA with a higher potency of long-term improvement in its cost structure. Market-wise, the demand for data storage and compute capacity continues to grow, now owning and operating data centers may allow MARA to have a larger market opportunity. Overall, the company is now best-capitalized and can edge by pursuing M&A opportunities to accelerate its operational growth and compute expansion. MARA Investor Presentation Energy Dependency, Bitcoin Price Volatility, and HODL Strategy As observed, MARA Holdings targets to reduce OpEx (mostly energy costs), but it requires sharp scaling of energy generation and managing power prices against the macro challenges. While MARA hit a high reduction in energy costs (through its partnership with NGON ) the ability to continue to derive electricity at ~$0.01 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) against the market price of $0.04 per kWh makes the long-term scalability of this cost-saving strategy uncertain. Although this reduction can be sustained with the use of stranded gas, the availability of this energy resource on a large scale (for MARA's needs) may be limited based on the outlook for demand from Asia giants. On the earnings call, MARA mentioned over 1 million gigawatt-hours of available stranded gas. However, this is an estimate based on the entire market availability, not what can be reliably captured and utilized by MARA alone. Although MARA is focusing on securing more control over its energy generation by investing in its own sites, its energy strategy is still subject to partnerships and the state of the market. MARA is currently operating in competitive energy regions like PJM that do not offer exclusive control over pricing and supply. If the cost of energy and access to cheap stranded gas increases or at least becomes more volatile, MARA can be hit by high operational/bottom-line issues and related drops in valuations. iea.org Moreover, MARA's move to expand its energy generation and cut costs by increasingly relying on its owned and operated data centers (scaling energy infrastructure with new technologies like micro data centers) is capital intensive. MARA's expansion efforts may continue to require massive financial outlay to build/acquire assets. Now, given the size of MARA's operations and its target to scale up capacity with large sites (100-megawatt and larger), any delays or failures in scaling energy resources could hurt its growth potential and street confidence (analysts' estimates). Further, MARA's balance sheet holds ~$2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) with an average purchase cost of under $50K per Bitcoin. This holding is a major fraction of its market value (28% at the time of writing), and the price fluctuations of Bitcoin directly hit MARA's stock price. MARA has a solid return on its Bitcoin investments due to the recent surge in Bitcoin prices, but the same volatility could also lead to massive losses if prices drop sharply below $50K (under Bitcoin Market Cycle). MARA's strategy on Bitcoin (Full ""HODLˮ approach) introduces huge risk by getting highly exposed to fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices. While the company preferred the flexibility in managing its Bitcoin through yield generation, collateralized loans, or asset purchases, all-in-all these solutions still carry risk. Lastly, the value of collateralized Bitcoin may diminish with a drop in Bitcoin prices reducing MARA's capability to derive cash from this source. calebandbrown.com Takeaway MARA's aggressive expansion of compute capacity, driven by industry-leading low acquisition multiples and cost-efficient operations, positions it as a dominant player in the digital asset and data center space. With 1.5 GW of capacity and unparalleled cost control, MARA is set for robust growth, offering superior ROI and scalability in a rapidly expanding market.",BTC-USD|MARA,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-02 14:00:00

After reaching a local high of $1.15 on November 23, the price retraced significantly and recently failed to reclaim this key level. The inability to break above $1.15 has raised questions about whether ADA’s bullish momentum can sustain its recent uptrend. Top analyst and investor Ali Martinez has weighed in, highlighting the potential for a 20% correction if Cardano loses critical demand zones. His analysis suggests that ADA’s current consolidation phase could either serve as a foundation for another rally or lead to further downside if key support levels fail to hold. The coming days will be pivotal for Cardano, as its price action will determine whether it can break above yearly highs or retreat to lower levels for consolidation. Investors closely monitor ADA’s ability to hold crucial support zones , as losing them could signal a deeper retracement. Conversely, a decisive move above $1.15 could renew bullish optimism, setting the stage for further gains. Cardano remains at a critical juncture, with both risk and opportunity shaping the market outlook. Cardano Losing Strength Cardano’s (ADA) price action has displayed weakening momentum as it struggles to maintain its upward trajectory. After failing to break above the key $1.15 resistance level decisively, ADA’s bullish momentum appears to be fading. Analysts are now questioning whether Cardano can sustain its recent rally or is poised for a deeper correction. Analyst Ali Martinez shared a detailed technical analysis on X , highlighting key levels that could dictate ADA’s next move. According to Martinez, a close below $1.10 would signal a potential trend shift, raising investor concerns. Furthermore, he notes that a drop below $1.03 would confirm a bearish breakout, potentially driving the price down to $0.88. Martinez’s analysis emphasizes the significance of supply and demand zones, suggesting that these levels could trigger sharp price reactions in either direction. Despite the bearish outlook, there is still room for optimism. Cardano could recover and potentially push toward new highs if the broader cryptocurrency market resumes its bullish trend. However, any upside may lack the strong momentum seen earlier in the rally. Cardano remains at a critical juncture, with its price hovering near key support levels. The next few days will determine whether ADA can reclaim its bullish footing or succumb to increased selling pressure. ADA Testing Support At Crucial Demand Level Cardano is currently trading at $1.08 after failing to sustain its recent bullish momentum above the previous high of $1.15. Despite briefly reaching a new local high of $1.19, the price could not maintain this level, slipping below the $1.15 threshold—a key demand zone that now acts as resistance. This inability to hold above previous highs raises concerns about the strength of ADA’s upward trend. The $1.15 level is pivotal for Cardano’s near-term price action. If ADA manages to reclaim this level and establish it as a solid support, it could reinvigorate bullish sentiment and potentially pave the way for further gains. However, failure to do so increases the risk of a deeper correction, as the current price suggests a lack of sustained buying pressure. Market participants are closely monitoring ADA’s price behavior around this critical zone. A sustained move above $1.15 could signal renewed demand and spark another attempt to push toward $1.20 and beyond. Conversely, continued weakness at current levels might lead to further downside, with ADA testing lower supports.

Similarly, the DEXX trading terminal suffered a $30 million breach. DEXX is working on recovering the stolen funds alongside law enforcement. Thanks to these crimes, regulatory scrutiny also intensified. The SEC filed a lawsuit against Touzi Capital for misleading investors about its crypto mining fund. On the other hand, some industry leaders expect a potential shift in regulatory enforcement under the new Trump administration. Clipper DEX Denies Private Key Leak Decentralized exchange (DEX) Clipper confirmed that the recent $450,000 hack of its protocol was due to a vulnerability in its withdrawal function. The DEX also dismissed earlier claims that the breach stemmed from a private key leak. The attack took place on Dec. 1, and targeted two liquidity pools. The hack resulted in the loss of about 6% of the protocol’s total value locked. Clipper assured its users that other pools remained unaffected and that the exploit was contained. In a statement on X, Clipper clarified that the ability to withdraw funds in a single token, a feature involving a bundled swap and deposit/withdrawal transaction, appeared to be the source of the exploit. This feature has since been disabled. Security firm Fuzzland’s co-founder, Chaofan Shou , previously speculated on X that the hack could be linked to an API vulnerability that allows unauthorized signing of deposit and withdrawal requests. Clipper, however, held firm that its design and security architecture ruled out a private key leak. The protocol paused swaps and deposits while keeping withdrawals open, albeit requiring a mix of assets from the pool. Clipper is actively tracing the stolen funds and reached out to the attacker to encourage them to contact the team. Crypto losses YTD (Source: Immunefi ) The hack contributes to a year that has already seen more than $1.48 billion worth of crypto stolen by the end of November, according to a report from Immunefi. This figure is still a 15% decline compared to the same period in 2023. $200K Hack Hits Spectral Labs’ Syntax Platform Spectral Labs also recently reported a $200,000 exploit on its Syntax platform, a no-code environment for creating on-chain AI agents. The attack happened due to a vulnerability in its bonding curve. The flaw allowed the attacker to remove tokens at a reduced price. In response, Spectral Labs disabled access to Syntax and paused contracts to prevent any more damage. The company assured users that it is addressing the issue, running extensive tests, and collaborating with industry partners to restore functionality as soon as possible. Crypto hacks and exploits are still a major challenge for the industry. Immunefi’s report shows that November losses from crypto hacks and fraud totaled $71 million. Some of the most serious incidents in November included the $25.5 million exploit of decentralized finance project Thala , which was caused by a vulnerability in its v1 farming contracts. Crypto losses from November of 2024 (Source: Immunefi ) Thala recovered the stolen funds on Nov. 18 with the help of law enforcement but has not revealed the hacker's identity. Another big breach involved the DEXX on-chain trading terminal, where a private key leak resulted in huge losses. Over 8,620 Wallets Linked to DEXX Exploit The recent security exploit on the meme coin trading terminal DEXX drew a lot of attention from the crypto community, with more than 8,620 Solana addresses now suspected of being linked to the hacker behind the attack. On Nov. 16, DEXX fell victim to a breach that resulted in financial losses that affected at least 900 unique users. According to SlowMist’s blockchain intelligence arm, MistTrack , most of the victims lost less than $10,000, but one individual suffered losses of more than $1 million. The total loss from the incident was initially reported to be $21 million, which made it the second-largest hack in November after the $25.5 million Thala attack. Unfortunately, the scale of the DEXX exploit continued to grow, and SlowMist founder Cos revealed that the total losses climbed to an estimated $30 million on Nov. 29. The fluctuating prices of meme tokens impacted the overall financial damage, according to Cos. The hacker has been converting the stolen assets into Solana. SlowMist also committed to publishing any additional wallet addresses that are suspected of being linked to the attack on other blockchains, including Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Base, in the coming week. In response to the attack, DEXX has been actively working on recovery efforts. The platform issued a public statement confirming that it is monitoring the hacker’s wallets and collaborating with blockchain security firm SlowMist and law enforcement agencies. To incentivize the return of stolen assets, DEXX offered a bug bounty and token rewards, but the hacker did not respond to these appeals. Attempts to communicate with the attacker through on-chain messages and email have also been unsuccessful. Bruce, the operations director at DEXX, stated that the platform is actively negotiating with stakeholders, counting the losses, and addressing security vulnerabilities to relaunch the service. The company pledged to compensate the affected users, but the specifics of the compensation plan will depend on the amount of recovered funds. SEC Sues Touzi Capital Recent crypto crimes were not only limited to hacks. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Touzi Capital, accusing the investment firm of misleading investors about the liquidity and profitability of its crypto asset mining fund. According to the SEC, Touzi Capital raised almost $95 million from over 1,200 U.S. investors by promoting the fund as a stable and high-yield investment tied to cryptocurrency mining operations. However, the regulator alleges that the firm misrepresented the risks and diverted investor funds into unrelated ventures. The SEC claims Touzi Capital made false assurances to investors, and compared the fund to high-yield money market accounts while hiding its risky and illiquid nature. Despite the alleged failures of its investments, the firm reportedly continued accepting funds from new investors. The regulator’s complaint also alleges that the promised crypto mining operations were not the primary focus of the raised capital as funds were being commingled across Touzi Capital’s subsidiaries for purposes unrelated to mining. This case is part of a broader crackdown by the SEC on alleged crypto-related frauds, including a recent unsuccessful appeal by Kristoffer Krohn, who argued that his involvement in an $18 million crypto mining scheme did not constitute a securities offering. The federal judge decided to deny Krohn’s appeal. Despite these legal actions, industry leaders like Consensys CEO Joe Lubin suggest that the regulatory landscape for crypto firms could change dramatically very soon. At DevCon 2024 in Thailand, Lubin speculated that the reelection of Donald Trump as U.S. president might lead to the dismissal of many SEC cases, and could potentially save the industry huge amounts of legal costs. However, he pointed out that while not all cases may be dropped, the crypto sector will certainly benefit from a more favorable regulatory environment in the future.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-02 14:00:37

It reached as high as $2.42 before stabilizing around $2.35. This huge hit came after many positive developments brewing around Ripple and XRP with talks of XRP ETFs, stablecoin launch, and IPOs, XRP future indeed looks bright. Recent data from Santiment shows that in just three weeks, wallets holding between 1 million and 10 million XRP coins bought over 679 million tokens. Also, the number of wallets holding XRP has hit a new record of over 5.5 million. These signs show that many big investors are confident in XRP’s long-term potential and that it’s a good time to buy. What Experts Are Saying Dan Tapiero, a well-known investor, has praised XRP’s recent surge, pointing out that the market didn’t fully understand its potential before. He believes this 400% jump isn’t luck but a sign of XRP’s strong fundamentals. He believes that XRP’s price is overlooked by many and since it’s opening wings now it will be the best buy in the coming months. Raoul Pal, the CEO of Real Vision, admitted he was wrong about XRP earlier this year and now sees its growth as significant. Earlier in 2024, Pal had dismissed XRP and Cardano (ADA) as “old cult coins” and urged investors to steer clear of them. However, with XRP’s remarkable rally and growing market influence, Pal admitted he was wrong in his earlier assessment. In a series of X posts, Pal noted that the market conditions and developments surrounding XRP are changing and so is his stance. He referred to XRP’s recent rise as the “Banana Zone,” a playful term he used to describe a phase of explosive growth. Pal’s comments suggest that XRP’s recent performance has forced him to reconsider his XRP take, seeing it as a major player in the crypto space rather than a forgotten token. Ripple’s Legal Wins Are Key Tapiero further noted that XRP is rising because the biggest regulatory hurdle is at ease. Ripple recent legal victory is the root where the judge ruled that XRP is not a security (like stocks), and the SEC reduced its fine from $2 billion to just $125 million. These victories helped clear up legal doubts surrounding XRP and boosted investor confidence. Adding to the good news, the head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, announced that he will step down in January 2025, which some believe could lead to more favorable regulations for cryptocurrencies. Another factor that’s driving the bulls are anticipated approval of Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD on Dec 4, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. What lies ahead for XRP? With Bitcoin hovering around $95,000, the overall crypto market is looking positive. Moreover, at present XRP is holding strong above key support levels, showing continued buyer interest. If it stays above $2, the next target will be $5, and many believe this could be just the beginning of a much larger rally.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-02 14:09:27

The price is heading towards the yearly highs at $22.89 with an aim to set up a bullish path towards the ATH. The price recorded one of the most bullish monthly closes, with a rise of over 80%, not seen since the 2021 bull run. The price printed massive bullish candles then, and hence a similar pattern suggests the LINK pric e is at the foothill of a massive explosion, which may elevate the levels beyond a 3-digit figure. The catalyst of the rise is the recent partnership announcement of Chainlink with 21X, Europe’s first tokenised securities trading and settlement system, to launch the very first EU-regulated financial market infrastructure. With this, the LINK price broke the resistance at $19.25 with a major force, shooting past $20 in the past few hours. All eyes are now on $22.90, which is around the yearly highs, and a breakout from this range may propel the price towards a new ATH. The monthly chart of Chianlink displays a breakout from the multi-year symmetrical triangle before reaching the apex. This suggests strong bullish momentum being piled up since the past month as the buying volume revamped after largely being under bearish influence since the start of the year. The immediate upper target could be around $34.2 at 0.618 FIB, which could pay way for the price to reach the ATH at 1 FIB at $52.88. Meanwhile, the technicals have tuned in favour of the bulls as the RSI has just launched an incremental range along the ascending support as it appeared during the 2021 bull run. On the other hand, the MACD, which was about to undergo a bearish crossover, has reversed as the buying pressure escalates. Therefore, there are clear signals of a bullish continuation with the upper targets as mentioned in the chart, provided the yearly close is above the pattern. Chainlink is largely considered to be undervalued despite being the integral part of not only DeFi but traditional finance, insurance, real estate, gaming, etc., and many more. However, the integration into other financial entities, including DTCC, and now with 21X, highlights the project’s potential.

In an X post reaching out to Ripple enthusiasts, Raoul said : You Were Right, I Was Wrong. Well done! Dinosaurs still roam the earth. Raoul Pal Referring to them as “ XRP Jedi Warriors .” the crypto expert admitted his misjudgment while acknowledging their foresight regarding the token’s potential price rally. This comes after Ripple-affiliated cryptocurrency XRP experienced a dramatic rise beyond the $2 threshold, reclaiming its long-lost third position on the CoinMarketCap rankings. Pal also conceded that the Ripple community had “walked through hell to get here.” He reminded his audience that he still holds some of the Ripple tokens from the turbulent “delisting times” in 2021. During that period, following the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple and XRP—alleging the token was an unregistered security—several significant exchanges like Coinbase, Binance US, and Bitstamp suspended XRP trading. However, these platforms continued to allow users to hold Ripple in their wallets and enabled withdrawals and deposits without restrictions. XRP outperforms BNB, Solana, and USDT In August, Raoul Pal expressed skepticism about XRP and ADA, labeling them “cult” coins and cautioning investors against investing in these older assets. At that time, Ripple was trading around $0.50, showing minimal growth and ranking among the worst-performing crypto assets. With XRP’s recent breakthrough—first surpassing $1 and then surging beyond $2—Pal has admitted his earlier stance was incorrect. The token has surged to over $2.40, experiencing a remarkable 400% increase in value. The token has surpassed BNB and Solana in market rankings, including the largest stablecoin, USDT. It is now just behind Ethereum. Ripple unlocks 1 billion XRP as token surges The cryptocurrency market saw a general gain during the “Trump trade” phenomenon in November, although Ripple experienced minor setbacks due to its protracted regulatory limbo. Investors were greatly uneasy because the US SEC complaint claimed that Ripple was an unregistered security. Before these regulatory issues, XRP was the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, when the SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, its price dropped from around $0.50 to $0.17, erasing over $15 billion in market value. Now, the crypto’s supporters are optimistic about the regulatory situation improving. Another source of optimism is Ripple’s impending stablecoin, RLUSD. It is scheduled to launch on December 4, 2024, and is just awaiting approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). Once approved, Ripple can legally offer RLUSD to the public.

""We estimate that bitcoin miners earned an average of $52,000 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue in November, up 24% from October,"" analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote. The bank noted that transaction fees on the network spiked following the U.S. Nov. 5 presidential election and this provided some ""hashprice relief."" The hashprice is a measure of mining profitability. The total market cap of the 14 publicly listed bitcoin miners in the bank's coverage surged 52% in November to $36.2 billion, the report said. The average network hashrate rose 4% month-on-month to 731 exahash per second (EH/s), the bank noted, while mining difficulty increased 7% from October. Hashrate refers to the total combined computational power used to mine and process transactions on a proof-of-work blockchain and is a proxy for competition in the industry and mining difficulty.

The bulls have shown impressive strength, fueling optimism for a potential breakout . A successful move beyond $50 could signal the start of a robust rally, capturing the attention of traders and setting the stage for further upside. The goal of this article is to examine AVAX’s upward momentum as it nears the $50 resistance level, assessing the possibility of a breakout. It also delves into the technical and market factors influencing the price action, offering insights into whether the bulls can push AVAX higher or if resistance will trigger a pullback. Bullish Momentum Builds: Can AVAX Break Through? On the 4-hour chart, AVAX is positioned above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), a key indicator of its current bullish trajectory. Significantly, this alignment highlights the token’s underlying strength and suggests that positive sentiment is driving its momentum. The steady upward movement reflects growing optimism among traders, with Avalanche now eyeing the critical $50 resistance level. An examination of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that the RSI has climbed back above the 70% threshold after experiencing a decline to 52%, signaling a resurgence in buying pressure and reflecting renewed bullish movement in the market. A persistent climb would indicate strong overbought conditions, suggesting robust demand and the possibility of more price growth. Also, the daily chart highlights AVAX’s strong upward movement, marked by the formation of a bullish candlestick as the price surges toward $50. Its position above the SMA reinforces the positive trend, demonstrating sustained strength. This upward movement bolsters market confidence, setting the stage for a continued rally . Lastly, the daily chart’s RSI recently reached 75%, indicating that AVAX has entered overbought territory. This suggests a strong optimistic sentiment, with significant buying pressure pushing the price higher. While this level points to the potential for more upside, it also signals that the asset may be overheating. Breakout Or Pullback On The Horizon? As Avalanche nears the crucial $50 resistance level, two possible outcomes are unfolding: a breakout or a pullback. If the bullish momentum persists, AVAX could surpass the $50 mark, sparking a rally toward higher levels. This would signal a continuation of the upward trend, with the next target being the $65 resistance level. However, if the $50 resistance holds, a pullback may follow, with the price possibly testing the $42 support level. A break below this level could lead to further downside, pushing AVAX toward additional support zones.",AVAX|Avalanche|AVAXUSD|AVAXUSDT|Relative Strength Index|RSI|Simple Moving Average|SMA,EN,0,0,AVAX|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-02 15:30:17

XRP has been rising ever since Donald Trump won last month’s election, yet compared to many other major token it remains relatively underpriced, which is why it has been beating the market in recent days. It’s now up by 50% in a week and by a huge 340% in a month, with these ascents enabling it to overtake Solana in terms of market cap. And given that it’s still down on its 2018 ATH by 33%, it could continue to see outsized gains for a while yet, as the marker catches up with its potential value. XRP Overtakes Solana and Tether as Market Cap Reaches $139 Billion – Can XRP Hit $100 Next? XRP is currently correcting after hitting what was its highest price since January 2018, with the coin reaching a 24-hour peak of $2.48 earlier this morning. Its indicators do suggest that it may have entered an overbought position, with its relative strength index (purple) falling from just over 80 to just over 50. Source: TradingView Its 30-period average (orange) has potentially peaked in relation to the longer term 200-period average (blue), something which also indicates that a correction should be coming. However, the market had oversold and undervalued XRP for years, so it may take several more weeks of catch up before the coin stops rising. Its volume has touched $36.7 billion today, which is its highest level ever, and a very strong sign of exploding demand. The past few days have seen some big XRP buys from whales , who continue to stock up on the token in expectation of future gains. 12,160,698 #XRP (29,863,787 USD) transferred from #Binance to unknown wallet https://t.co/F91qzkiQQv — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 2, 2024 Aside from its undervaluation, XRP has been performing so well because of how the election of Donald Trump has changed the regulatory landscape for it and Ripple. While the SEC had filed an appeal against the company prior to the election, Trump’s victory likely means that this appeal is now dead in the water (and some legal experts had suggested it didn’t have much of a chance anyway). And with current SEC Chairman Gary Gensler recently confirming that he will step down upon Trump’s inauguration, the next four years could end up being very profitable for Ripple. My $XRP Price Targets: $0.75 $0.90 $1.50 $1.80 $2.40 $5 $8 $10 $22 $30 $130 $700 $1000 $10,000+ — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) December 1, 2024 It’s therefore on track to pass its current ATH of $3.40 in the next few months, potentially reaching this milestone by H2 2025. New High-Performance Meme Tokens Traders worried that XRP is already overbought may prefer to turn to newer, small-cap tokens, which can often have more upside potential, particularly if they attract new listings. And one very coin on the up right now is Catslap (SLAP), an Ethereum-based token that has launched directly to DEXes. It started trading on Uniswap a few weeks ago , and is up by over 1,000% from its listing price, according to DEXTools . SLAP now boasts around 10,000 holders since listing on November 21, with the coin already having a market cap of $13.6 million. Catslap has been successful since its launching because it’s more than utility-free meme token, with the coin having its very own slap-to-earn mini-game. Users can play this game via Catslap’s official website , which invites users to click (or tap) the screen in order to animate a cat-slap gif. This is an extremely simple mechanic, but the game rewards players with more SLAP tokens, incentivising ownership and engagement with the project.

It’s also highly bullish that Catslap’s X account now has 10,000 followers , a sign of how much it could grow in the future. SLAP comes with a max supply of 9 billion SLAP, with 50% of this going to liquidity, 20% to staking rewards, 10% to community rewards, 10% to development, and 10% to its team (with this latter 10% vested for ten years).

The company may allow initial buyers to purchase an extra $105 million in notes within 13 days of issuance. $700M Convertible Notes Offering MARA plans to use up to $50 million from the note sale to buy back part of its 2026 convertible notes through private deals. The rest of the funds will go toward acquiring more Bitcoin and general purposes like working capital, strategic acquisitions, asset expansion, and debt repayment, according to the official press release . The company expects the notes to be issued with no interest, except in rare cases where special interest may apply, and the principal amount is expected to remain unchanged. The notes, maturing in 2030, are convertible into cash, equity, or a combination of the two. This strategy helps MARA improve its balance sheet by replacing short-term obligations with long-term debt while continuing its investment in digital assets. The move comes less than a week after MARA acquired 6,474 BTC from its $1 billion convertible note offering at 0% interest. In the same announcement, the company also revealed buying $200 million worth of its 2026 notes and plans to use the remaining $160 million to purchase more Bitcoin at more favorable prices during market dips. This strategy aligns with MicroStrategy’s approach of issuing corporate debt to increase BTC holdings, a growing trend among businesses. Bitcoin For Financial Sovereignty: MARA’s Recommendations MARA Holdings recently called on the United States policymakers to take the lead in Bitcoin mining, positioning the asset as crucial for national security and financial sovereignty. The mining company stressed Bitcoin’s finite supply, decentralization, and cross-border transferability, comparing it to gold as a store of value. MARA argued that controlling Bitcoin’s blockspace and hash rate would ensure access to secure transactions, preventing manipulation by “adversarial” nations. The firm recommended the US to develop domestic Bitcoin mining infrastructure, prioritize renewable energy adoption, and reduce reliance on foreign ASIC chips. This strategic shift could strengthen the economy, boost energy grids, and create high-tech jobs.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE.

Spot Crypto Exchange Volume Hits $2.7 Trillion in November, Highest Since 2021 This figure was more than double the $1.14 trillion volume in October, underscoring the revival in market activity. Data revealed that Binance traded over $986 billion, accounting for around 36% of November volume. Other major players include Crypto.com, Upbit, and Bybit, each of which surpassed $200 billion in monthly trading volume. Significant growth was observed across regions, highlighting a global increase in trading activity. Bitcoin and Ethereum futures also saw significant growth, with Bitcoin futures volume reaching $2.59 trillion and Ethereum futures volume reaching $1.28 trillion, both reaching their highest levels since May 2021. Catalysts for Growth The record-breaking activity comes after pro-crypto Republican Donald Trump was re-elected as US President on November 6. Trump's victory sparked a wave of optimism in the crypto market, with Bitcoin surpassing its previous all-time high to reach $99,635. Solana also hit a new record high, with the GMCI 30 index tracking the top 30 cryptocurrencies rising 62.3% in November. *This is not investment advice.

On-chain data has attributed this mindblowing monthly rally to whales accumulating the asset, mostly on Coinbase. It almost seems like a repeat now when it comes down to XRP’s price performances in the past month and since Sunday, in particular, but there’s a lot going on around the asset. Recall that just yesterday, Ripple’s native token traded at around $1.9. However, it exploded first to over $2.2, as reported, before it shot up to $2.5 for the first time since January 2018. During the market-wide retracement from earlier on Monday, it slipped back down to $2.2, but the bulls stepped up on the gas pedal once again and initiated another massive rally. This time, XRP’s price skyrocketed to $2.75, which became a new local peak. Moreover, the cryptocurrency came just 23% away from its all-time high of $3.4 (CoinGecko data). XRPUSD. Source: TradingView Despite retracing slightly to under $2.7 now, XRP is still up by over 420% in the past month. This surge has pushed its market cap to well beyond $150 billion, solidifying its place as the third-largest cryptocurrency by this metric. Many reports claimed that this rally was driven primarily by whales accumulating substantial portions of the asset. CryptoQuant’s CEO, Ki Young Ju, confirmed this narrative but also shed some more light, noting that most of the buying took place on Coinbase. This makes sense due to the expected political change in the United States following Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential elections and Gary Gensler’s announcement that he will step down as SEC Chair in January. Coinbase whales are driving this $XRP rally. Over the past 30 days, Coinbase’s minute-level price premium has ranged from 3% to 13% during the surge. Meanwhile, Upbit—a Korean exchange with more XRP investors than Binance—has shown no significant premium so far. pic.twitter.com/ENESB2Zrkv — Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) December 2, 2024 The post Ripple Price Eyes $3 as XRP Goes Parabolic: Who Is Behind This Rally? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-02 15:41:26

The only project that unites the top meme coins to harness their collective memetic power and offer huge staking rewards has sparked massive FOMO, with less than 18 days remaining in its presale. As funding continues to pour in, the outlook for $STARS’ debut on exchanges is sky-high, with some predicting potential returns of 10x or more. This momentum has earned Crypto All-Stars widespread attention, including praise from popular crypto influencer Daryl Boo, who has called $STARS “the most bullish coin of 2024.” At its current presale price of $0.0016582, early investors have a rare opportunity to secure positions for maximum gain. With the rapidly growing interest, this price point may never be seen again. Meme coins are taking over, and Crypto All-Stars is spicing things up The meme coin sector, with a collective market valuation of $127 billion, clearly demonstrates the significant value in internet culture. Currently ranked 18th in market capitalization across all crypto sectors, meme coins have become a force to be reckoned with, according to CoinGecko data. This is remarkable, considering that just eight years ago, only one meme coin – Dogecoin ($DOGE) – was making headlines. Today, multiple meme coins are in the spotlight, shifting attention away from many altcoins. With this surge in popularity, it’s not unthinkable that meme coins could one day break into the top 10 sectors in the crypto industry. As of November, two of the top-performing assets in the space were Dogecoin and Shiba Inu ($SHIB), with Dogecoin delivering a 310% gain year-to-date and Shiba Inu following with 150%. In comparison, Bitcoin, which reached new all-time highs in November, ranked fourth, with Solana ($SOL) taking third. This trend isn’t limited to just the well-established meme coins. Lesser-known tokens, such as Chill Guy ($CHILLGUY), have seen a 120% jump on mere rumors of a Binance listing last week – further proof of the immense potential in this sector. Source: CoinGecko And to spice things up with even higher returns, the Crypto All-Stars meme coins staking platform – the MemeVault – is here. It’s starting to become a race to buy $STARS Crypto All-Stars’ MemeVault is the industry’s first unified meme coin staking platform that brings together top meme coins like $DOGE, $SHIB, Brett ($BRETT) – which recently hit an all-time high similar to $BTC – and potentially $CHILLGUY and other rising meme coins set to break into the top meme coin list. This staking protocol, once launched, will simplify the staking process by eliminating the need to juggle multiple protocols to generate returns. This All-Star train is still going! They are having a blast! pic.twitter.com/3WYhAeohWL — Crypto All-Stars (@all_stars_coin) November 27, 2024 Instead, users can rely on just one protocol to quickly generate passive income for their meme coin stash. Now, where does $STARS fit into all this? The answer lies in it being the key to unlocking the full potential of MemeVault. Simply holding $STARS can multiply staking rewards by up to three times the normal rate, which is why it’s no wonder investors are rushing to secure as much $STARS in presale as they can. Furthermore, users are also taking advantage of the platform’s independent staking protocol to grow their holdings at 282% APY before the MemeVault launch. The race to become a Crypto All-Stars whale intensifies with each passing day. Binance wants to focus on utility rather than meme coins – wait till CZ learns about Crypto All-Stars Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) recently voiced his growing frustration with crypto’s whimsical assets, despite his company aggressively listing meme coins. CZ has made it clear that he wants to focus on blockchain projects with real utility. I am not against memes, but meme coins are getting ""a little"" weird now. Let's build real applications using blockchain. — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) November 26, 2024 However, CZ might have to retract his statement once Crypto All-Stars catches his attention. With the MemeVault in its corner, Crypto All-Stars is far from just a meme coin. The ease with which it generates passive returns for users is a form of utility that the sector is embracing with open arms. Crypto All-Stars wasn’t built just to entertain or satisfy the crypto degen’s risk appetite – it’s also about creating more stable returns for a sector driven mostly by wild speculation. In this way, Crypto All-Stars could be the future the sector needs to boost its valuation and legitimize and establish meme coins as a credible, high-value part of the crypto ecosystem. In other words, becoming an early supporter of Crypto All-Stars now is like backing the future of meme coins. How do we back the future of meme coins? Buy $STARS To give the future of meme coins a leg up, be a $STARS holder today and support the launch of MemeVault. Visit the Crypto All-Stars website , connect your wallet (e.g. Best Wallet ), and swap ETH, USDT, or BNB for $STARS. Bank cards are also accepted. In addition, you can use popular meme coins like $FLOKI, $SHIB, $DOGE, and $PEPE to grab $STARS tokens through the site’s easy-to-use widget. Crypto All-Stars prioritizes investor peace of mind, which is why two leading crypto audit firms, Coinsult and SolidProof , have thoroughly audited its smart code. These audits confirm that its code is free from critical errors. Engage with the Crypto All-Stars community on Telegram or X. The presale could easily reach its next funding goal of $9 million this week, especially as it nears its close.

With over $3 million raised in its presale, Lunex stands out as an accessible and innovative option for investors who eye the next bull run. Meanwhile, Solana and Ripple continue to dominate headlines, bolstered by the Bitwise filings for ETFs that could reshape dynamics in the market. Why Lunex Is Gaining Momentum Lunex addresses critical blockchain challenges by streamlining cross-chain transactions. This approach minimizes costs and improves liquidity, key factors for scalability in decentralized finance. Tokens are priced at just $0.0033, offering investors an affordable entry into a project built for sustainability. The 18% revenue-sharing model rewards long-term holders, making Lunex an attractive alternative for those seeking consistent returns. As the DeFi ecosystem expands, Lunex’s focus on interoperability positions it to rival larger players. While Solana and Ripple lead in market presence, Lunex appeals to investors looking for growth opportunities tied to practical, user-focused solutions. XRP ETF Developments Boost Ripple Activity on Ripple (XRP) saw a surge after the announcement of an XRP ETF filing by Bitwise. Analysts expect the XRP price could climb further, with the $2 mark well within reach as December approaches. The potential of Ripple extends far beyond short-term gains. Projections suggest a price of $33.21 by 2025, because XRP captures the attention of both retail and institutional investors. The XRP ETF filing reinforces the idea that institutional interest is here to stay and this drives Ripple’s momentum in the ongoing bull run. Solana Prepares for Its Next Big Move Solana (SOL) reached a new all-time high of $264. Despite a pullback to $222, market optimism remains strong. Analysts predict another rally, where SOL targets of $300 or even more in the coming weeks. The Bitwise SOL ETF filing further strengthens the appeal of Solana. It’s known for its fast transaction speeds and efficient ecosystem and because of that Solana consistently ranks among the most favored platforms for decentralized applications. ETF-related developments bolsters institutional confidence and underscores its position as a top contender for gains in the bull run. Lunex Stands Out in a Crowded Market While Solana and Ripple benefit from institutional backing, Lunex offers unique advantages for those seeking high-growth opportunities in DeFi. Its focus on cross-chain functionality fills a critical gap in the ecosystem. For backers of Lunex, the current market climate presents a golden opportunity. As XRP and SOL ETFs gain traction, Lunex could capitalize on the rising tide of institutional and retail investment in decentralized finance. With practical solutions and a clear growth strategy, Lunex positions itself as a leading contender in the next bull run. The Time to Act Is Now The Bitwise filings for XRP ETF and SOL ETF mark a pivotal moment for the crypto market. Solana and Ripple are positioned for significant growth, but Lunex brings fresh potential to the table. With its innovative approach and accessible entry point, Lunex offers a compelling option for investors aiming to stay ahead in the DeFi space. For those ready to act, Lunex combines affordability with innovation, making it a standout choice as DeFi gains momentum. The bull run is shaping the future of crypto, and Lunex is poised to play a key role in what’s to come.

Poised to commence in March 2025, the academy’s return to Europe after a two-year hiatus will offer a new generation of developers the chance to gain hands-on expertise in blockchain and web3 technologies. At the heart of the initiative is a partnership with the prestigious Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts, renowned for its commitment to innovation and applied research. The collaboration underscores PBA’s mission to cultivate a global pool of developer talent equipped to tackle the onchain challenges of tomorrow. Lucerne: A Hub of Learning and Innovation Nestled in the picturesque Swiss Alps, Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts boasts a reputation for cutting-edge research and a strong emphasis on applied learning. Its newly established institute for blockchain research makes it an ideal setting for the European cohort of Polkadot Blockchain Academy . The university combines state-of-the-art facilities with a commitment to fostering technological advancement, creating an inspiring environment for developers looking to deepen their blockchain knowledge. The decision to host Cohort 6 in Lucerne reflects the academy’s recognition of the university’s role as a thought leader in blockchain and its potential to provide students with a supportive, innovation-driven framework. Cohort 6 of PBA will offer an intensive, nearly three-week program tailored to developers at different stages of their journey. The curriculum is divided into two tracks. The Protocol (on-chain) track will focus on the foundational aspects of Polkadot’s architecture and blockchain engineering. The newly introduced Dapps (off-chain) track, meanwhile, is designed to meet the growing demand for decentralized application development. Led by experts including Dr. Gavin Wood, Polkadot’s co-founder and visionary, the academy emphasizes practical training, ensuring that participants leave with skills they can immediately apply in their careers. The academy isn’t limited to Polkadot enthusiasts; it caters to blockchain developers across ecosystems and even web2 engineers eager to transition into web3. Breaking Barriers to Blockchain Education For many aspiring developers, the costs of gaining sufficient training to attain an industry job can prove prohibitive. Polkadot Blockchain Academy eliminates this impediment for those fortunate enough to be accepted onto the course. Thanks to funding from the Polkadot Treasury, Cohort 6 participants will have their course fees, accommodation, and some meals covered, significantly lowering the financial threshold for entry. The rigorous application process ensures that only the most dedicated candidates make it through. Applicants must pass a blockchain fundamentals exam, complete a programming assignment, and navigate an interview. Those who need a preparatory boost can turn to PBA-X, Polkadot’s online school, which provides foundational courses to help them qualify. This selective process ensures that the approximately 100 developers accepted are not only technically proficient but also deeply motivated to make their mark in the blockchain industry. For those with a passion for decentralized systems, the Lucerne course offers more than an education: it’s an entry point into a global movement. Whether attendees aim to design next-generation dapps or secure the backbone of blockchain protocols, PBA provides the tools, mentorship, and community to succeed.",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|DOT|FIAT|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-02 15:52:38

In a rapid-fire presentation lasting just over three minutes, Saylor presented 44 slides outlining why Microsoft should adopt Bitcoin. “Microsoft can’t afford to miss the next technology wave, and Bitcoin is that wave,” Saylor stated in a Dec. 1 video of his pitch. He suggested the firm convert its cash flows, dividends, stock buybacks, and debt into Bitcoin, claiming: “If you do that, you’ll add hundreds of dollars to the stock price. You can create trillions of dollars of enterprise value. You can strip away risk from your shareholders.” Saylor projected that Microsoft’s share price could increase by up to $584 over the next decade if Bitcoin reached $1.7 million by 2034. This strategy, according to Saylor, could add $4.9 trillion to Microsoft’s valuation, propelling it beyond its current $3.18 trillion market cap as the world’s third most valuable company, trailing Apple and Nvidia. Bitcoin has already surged 120% this year, nearing the $100,000 mark. Since 2020, MicroStrategy has purchased 386,700 BTC for $21.9 billion, now valued at nearly $37.6 billion. MicroStrategy shares have soared 465.5% in 2024, with the stock reaching $421.88 in late November, a new all-time high since the dot-com era. Saylor noted growing political and public support for Bitcoin, citing statements from incoming U.S. President Donald Trump and Bitcoin-backed products from major Wall Street firms. He proposed Microsoft invest $100 billion annually in Bitcoin, asserting, “It makes a lot more sense to buy Bitcoin than to buy your own stock back or to hold bonds.” “It’s time for Microsoft to evaluate its Bitcoin strategic options,” Saylor concluded. “So do the right thing for the world and adopt Bitcoin.”",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 15:58:06

The comment was made at a time when people in the United States are still discussing pardons, especially after Joe Biden issued a pardon to his son, Hunter Biden. In a recent X post, Telos executive director, John Lilic, suggested incoming president Donald Trump consider a pardon for the former Binance CEO so he could get back to helping the crypto industry attain new heights. Responding to Lilic’s post, CZ clarified he has no intentions to return to the helms at Binance, but would accept a presidential pardon with open arms. No wish to be CEO again. But definitely wouldn't mind a pardon. — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 2, 2024 CZ’s guilty plea and career shift Changpeng Zhao (CZ) stepped down as Binance’s chief executive in 2023 after he entered a plea of guilty to money laundering charges. Under the deal, he agreed to an indefinite ban from managing or running Binance and received a four-month jail term. CZ was released in September, and since then, he has been spotted actively investing in artificial intelligence, which is a different effort from his previous leadership in the cryptocurrency market. The U.S. President has the power to issue a pardon that would clear an individual from the crime he or she committed. A pardon for CZ could mean that he may come back as the CEO of Binance, but he has not shown interest in the position.

While the likes of Pepe are also seeing strong growth, several emerging meme coins could be set for even bigger gains. SHIB Catching Up After DOGE Rally Shiba Inu has begun showing strength against Dogecoin this week, a signal that attention and liquidity will begin to rotate from the market leader in the weeks ahead. Dogecoin has enjoyed monumental success this month, adding over $35 billion to its market cap. However, this week’s momentum has slowed. It’s gained 4.5%, while Shiba Inu is up 17%. DOGE is up 172% this month, while SHIB is up 69%. There’s a big gap for Shiba Inu to fill. And that’s what analysts think is about to happen. Currently, SHIB is trading at $0.00002992 with a $17.3 billion market cap and a $7.07 billion 24-hour trading volume. The Crypto King notes that SHIB is now “breaking out of a 4-year downtrend.” According to the analyst, the breakout will spark a run toward its ATH, a 174% gain. https://twitter.com/thekryptoking_/status/1863218467757043736 Brett Preparing For Tier-1 Exchange Listings? Prominent analyst and Brett proponent Crash suggests that a Binance or Coinbase listing is incoming for Brett. He noted that Brett is now the largest meme coin to ever not be listed on either exchange. Currently, Brett has a $2 billion market cap and a $253 million 24-hour trading volume. $BRETT is the largest market cap memecoin EVER not listed on @Binance or @coinbase YET Whos listing first? And just how bullish is this thing to be at 2B without either so far pic.twitter.com/xQudxwm2s3 — Crash (@CrashiusClay69) December 1, 2024 Crash suggests that Binance will list Brett with a market cap between $2 and $4 billion, while Coinbase may wait a little longer to promote activity on its Base Layer 2 blockchain. https://twitter.com/CrashiusClay69/status/1863114931899355556 Brett has shown considerable strength this month, pumping 129%. Indeed, a tier-1 exchange listing would be bullish for Brett, but Crash also noted how bullish it is that Brett has reached a $2 billion market cap without big-name exchanges. Best Meme Coins to Buy for December Rally While established meme coins continue to grow, several new tokens look like they could provide bigger growth over the Christmas period. Here are three meme coins to watch: Pepe Unchained Pepe Unchained is an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain designed for meme coins. Right now, it’s undergoing a presale, which means investors can buy at what could be the best-ever price. The presale has raised $63 million so far, showing massive demand. The chain is expected to be 100x faster than Ethereum and much chepaer, which makes it ideal for trading meme coins. It’ll also have a “Pepe Pump Pad,” a meme coin launchpad that allows anyone to create a token without coding. https://twitter.com/pepe_unchained/status/1839304995465998825 Other features include a block explorer, staking, and a decentralized exchange. The presale will end in 11 days, and then $PEPU will debut on the open market. According to the website, it will list on tier-1 exchanges. With meme coins on the rise, Pepe Unchained is emerging at just the right time. Catslap Catslap is a new cat-themed meme coin on the Ethereum network. The project offers a Slap-to-Earn game that allows users to earn free tokens. It launched on exchanges less than two weeks ago but has already seen significant success. At its peak, it pumped over 58x from its launch price. However, investors now have a second buying opportunity after $SLAP retraced with the rest of the market. https://twitter.com/CatSlapToken/status/1863265620600422475 The project has almost $4 million in locked liquidity, 8,000 holders, $900K in 24-hour trading volume, and 12K followers on its social media channels. Evidently, the market is paying close attention to this project. This early momentum could indicate $SLAP is the next cat-themed meme coin to explode. It has a $24 million market cap, leaving massive room for growth to catch the top cat coins such as Popcat and Mog Coin. Catslap is back on the rise, pumping 5% in the last hour and 4% in the last six hours. Flockez Flockerz is a meme coin all about decentralization. The project distributes control to its holders via a “Vote-to-Earn” decentralized autonomous exchange (DAO). This means $FLOCK holders get to vote on all key decisions relating to the project’s future and get paid for it. Self-appointed and centralized teams control many meme coins, and holders have no say in the projects’ future direction. Flockerz offers an attractive alternative, and its proving in popular demand. https://twitter.com/FlockerzToken/status/1862874262769746259 And there’s more. Users can also stake their $FLOCK tokens to increase their rewards. Right now, Flockerz staking offers a 583% APY, but this will gradually decrease as the staking pool grows. Flockerz is currently undergoing a presale and has raised $4.1 million so far. The current price is $0.0061997, but this will increase in one day.",Press Release,EN,0,0,DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-02 16:00:06

Analysts predict it could achieve over 5,000% growth in the coming months. This emerging token might surpass established names like TRX and Solana, capturing the attention of investors seeking the next big opportunity. CYBRO Presale Exceeds $5.5 Million: A One-in-a-Million Multichain Next GEN DeFi Investment Opportunity CYBRO is capturing the attention of crypto whales as its exclusive token presale quickly surges above $5.5 million. This next-generation DeFi platform offers investors unparalleled opportunities to enhance crypto earnings across multiple blockchains. The presale has now reached its 8th stage out of 10, offering investors a limited-time opportunity to purchase CYBRO tokens at the presale price of just $0.045 each. With only two stages remaining, the Token Generation Event (TGE) is fast approaching, at which point prices are expected to soar. Experts are projecting a potential ROI of 1200%, making this one of the most exciting investment opportunities in the DeFi ecosystem. In addition to its token offering, CYBRO has introduced a Points system, further enhancing investor incentives. Holders of these Points will automatically qualify for participation in the CYBRO Airdrop, with token distribution tied directly to the number of Points held. The platform allocates up to 1 million Points on a weekly basis, which investors can accrue through positions in CYBRO’s DeFi Vaults. Holders of CYBRO tokens will enjoy lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, cashback on purchases, reduced trading and lending fees, and a robust insurance program within the platform. With only 21% of the total tokens available for this presale and approximately 100 million already sold, this is a golden opportunity for savvy investors to secure a stake in a project that's truly one in a million. >>>Join CYBRO and aim for future returns up to 1200% Solana's Scalable Blockchain: Discovering SOL's Role in Dapps Development Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It provides a base for decentralized applications, known as dapps. Competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana aims for faster transactions through its unique architecture. It supports development in multiple programming languages, making it flexible for developers. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana. It is essential to the ecosystem. SOL is used for transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding those who support the network. The coin holds value as it powers the Solana ecosystem and gives users access to various projects. Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Instead, it attracts developers and investors with its high-capacity network. TRON (TRX): Empowering Content Creators with Decentralized Technology TRON (TRX) is a decentralized blockchain platform that aims to change how content creators earn rewards. It allows creators to have full ownership of their digital content. Users can directly support creators without intermediaries like YouTube or Facebook. TRON supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Developers can build dApps on TRON and offer content in exchange for digital assets. The platform uses a transaction model similar to Bitcoin, where transactions are recorded in a public ledger. TRON offers an open way to create and share content without worrying about transaction fees. It serves as an alternative to Ethereum for building decentralized applications. Conclusion In summary, while coins like SOL and TRX have had notable performances, their short-term potential appears limited. CYBRO stands out as a technologically advanced DeFi platform offering investors exceptional opportunities to enhance their earnings. Through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain, it provides lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases. The platform ensures a superior user experience with seamless deposits and withdrawals. Emphasizing transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO has attracted strong interest from crypto whales and influencers. As the market experiences significant growth in 2024, CYBRO is positioned to surpass expectations and potentially achieve remarkable gains in the coming months.

After providing a 58x gain with one of its featured cryptocurrencies, the presale raise has surged beyond the $1.8 million raised milestone. Investors are flocking to participate in this presale as early as possible, undoubtedly hoping that Best Wallet could surpass the heights of current industry leaders MetaMask and Trust Wallet. Best Wallet is a popular crypto wallet known for its wide range of features, many of which are unavailable on other wallets. Notably, its “Upcoming Tokens” feature is the hottest right now, having just provided a massive win for its users with Catslap. Join the $BEST Token Presale!

An investment of less than $20K would make you a millionaire. For some Best Wallet users, that’s precisely what happened last week. Best Wallet’s Upcoming Tokens feature is brand new to the crypto market and an innovative way for users to get day-one access to the most promising new cryptocurrencies. Last week, a new cat-themed meme coin called Catslap launched on the Ethereum network. The Best Wallet team has the heads up and listed it from launch. Best Wallet users were notified and could purchase it via the “Upcoming Tokens” feature without ever leaving the wallet. Within one week, the project had already gained a staggering 58x. $SLAP retraced with the rest of the market last week, but it remains over 20 times higher than its launch price. And that’s not the only success story of Upcoming Tokens. The wallet also provides access to the hottest presales on the market. Presales allow investors to buy at a fixed price before the token launches on exchanges. Best Wallet users can purchase the $BEST presale via Upcoming Tokens alongside other hot presales like Pepe Unchained and Crypto All-Stars. Pepe Unchained is an Ethereum layer 2 blockchain created solely for meme coins. It boasts 100x faster speeds and much cheaper transactions than the Ethereum main network. The presale has raised close to $60 million, showing immense demand. Once it lists on exchanges, there’s every chance this is the next explosive meme coin that provides gains. Crypto All-Stars is another. It’s building a meme coin staking app that lets users earn $STARS tokens for staking DOGE, SHIB, PEPE, and more. The presale has raised $7.5 million so far. But early access is not the only benefit. Users can make and track their Upcoming Tokens purchases directly from the app, adding a layer of security and convenience that was previously unavailable. They’ll also get major updates on their investments, ensuring they don’t miss something crucial. Always get the $BEST price Best Wallet is all about providing users with the best value. They’re doing this via a series of innovative products. Best DEX is already live on the wallet. It’s a decentralized exchange that aggregates liquidity from over 200 other exchanges and 20 blockchain bridges so that users always get the most value on their token swaps. And they’re even bringing this energy to the real world. Best Card is a crypto debit card that will be released soon. It will enable holders to spend their crypto in the real world and get cashback. The card works worldwide anywhere that Mastercard is accepted. Lastly, Best Wallet is multichain and available on over 60 networks, such as Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, and Tron. Users no longer have to manage multiple wallets and all the headaches that come with them – Best Wallet meets all their crypto needs. Analyst Crypto June says it could be the best crypto wallet for 2025. Trading fee discounts bonuses with Best Wallet token The $BEST token is the key to getting the most out of Best Wallet. Holding $BEST grants users governance rights, meaning they get a say on all key decisions relating to the project’s future. Moreover, it provides trading fee discounts across the Best Wallet ecosystem and even gives higher staking rewards. The token also opens holders to exclusive advantages on partner projects. For instance, Best Wallet has partnered with four iGaming sites, where $BEST holders get free spins, deposit bonuses, and more. But prospective buyers should act quickly. The $BEST price will rise throughout the presale, with the next increase later today. Follow Best Wallet on X or join its Telegram for updates.

MicroStrategy purchased 15,400 BTC for approximately $1.5 billion in cash, according to a Form 8-K , which public companies use to announce unexpected material events or corporate changes, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Dec. 2. The business intelligence company paid an average price of $95,976 per Bitcoin, including fees and expenses. This purchase brings MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin return to 38.7% for the quarter and 63.3% year-to-date. MicroStrategy has acquired 15,400 BTC for ~$1.5 billion at ~$95,976 per #bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 38.7% QTD and 63.3% YTD. As of 12/2/2024, we hodl 402,100 $BTC acquired for ~$23.4 billion at ~$58,263 per bitcoin. $MSTR https://t.co/K3TK4msGp0 — Michael Saylor (@saylor) December 2, 2024 Strategic Stock Sales Fuel Bitcoin Accumulation This latest purchase was funded through the sale of Class A common stock under a previously established sales agreement. Between Nov. 25 and Dec. 1, MicroStrategy sold approximately 3.7 million shares, generating net proceeds of around $1.48 billion after deducting sales commissions. This sale is part of a broader plan under the sales agreement with various financial institutions, which allows for the issuance and sale of up to $21 billion worth of shares. As of Dec. 1, MicroStrategy’s total Bitcoin holdings stand at 402,100 BTC, acquired at an aggregate purchase price of roughly $23.4 Billion. This equates to an average price of $58,263 per Bitcoin, including associated fees and costs. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings and share dilution. Source: MicroStrategy The sales agreement, initiated on Oct. 30 with TD Securities (USA) LLC and other sales agents, has facilitated the sale of shares, leaving the company with approximately $11.3 billion worth of shares available for future transactions. 2025 Will Become the “Year of the Crypto Renaissance” MicroStrategy continues to actively accumulate Bitcoin. To fund these purchases, the company is strategically issuing shares to expand its cryptocurrency holdings. This strategy aligns with CEO Michael Saylor’s vocal support for Bitcoin, further solidifying MicroStrategy’s position as a leading institutional holder of the cryptocurrency. MicroStrategy calls Bitcoin as “the highest performing uncorrelated asset that a corporation can hold on its balance sheet” in its recent presentation about the company’s Bitcoin strategy. In the presentation, MicroStrategy predicts that 2025 will be the “year of the crypto renaissance.” This prediction is based on anticipated developments such as Wall Street’s embrace of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) , widespread adoption of fair value accounting for digital assets, and a pro-Bitcoin stance from the next U.S. president and cabinet. Further supporting this “renaissance” are MicroStrategy’s expectations of growing congressional support for crypto, the establishment of a “Bitcoin Strategic Reserve” , and a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the U.S. MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) is closely tied to Bitcoin’s performance, but with amplified swings. While Bitcoin is up 150% this year, MSTR has surged by 513%. This heightened volatility was clear in November when MSTR soared 58%, exceeding Bitcoin’s 37% gain for the month. $MSTR November 2024 Returns: +58.47% December will be very interesting to see how we close out this amazing quarter and year.

A growing number of companies are adding the cryptocurrency to their balance sheets as a potential hedge against inflation . Artificial intelligence firm Genius Group also joined the trend on Nov. 18, purchasing 110 Bitcoin for $10 million and outlining its intention to hold up to 90% of its reserves in Bitcoin in the future. Additionally, tech solution provider Semler Scientific increased its Bitcoin holdings to 1,570 BTC by purchasing 297 coins for $29.1 million between Nov. 18 and 22 at an average price of $75,039 per coin. Adding to this trend, Japanese investment firm Metaplanet plans to raise over $62 million through a stock acquisition plan to buy more Bitcoin, adding to its current holdings of 1,142 Bitcoin.

PEPU has already raised over $64 million in its Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and is adding over $2 million to its tally daily behind heavy whale bidding. With less than 11 days left in its presale, the buys are ramping up and the new meme coin is on track to hit the $80 million mark. Considering the hype and FOMO surrounding it, it is no surprise that prominent investors are calling Pepe Unchained one of the best meme coins to buy now. Pepe Unchained’s L2 Chain, Meme Coin Launchpad and Other Unique Selling Points Pepe Unchained isn’t a run-of-the-mill token. While most frog-themed meme coins rely solely on their ‘Pepe The Frog’ packaging or their correlation with PEPE, PEPU is aiming to revolutionise the meme coin ecosystem with next-gen features. For instance, it is set to launch a Layer-2 ecosystem, soon after the conclusion of its presale. Unlike most ERC-20 meme coins, PEPU holders will benefit from extremely low trading costs, near-instantaneous transactions and cutting-edge tools like ETH-PEPU bridge, custom DEX, block explorer, advanced analytics, etc. Experts believe this is the perfect formula to attract retail investment and could be one of the key reasons behind its strong presale performance. Meanwhile, it is also launching Pepe’s Pump Pad, a two-click meme coin launchpad, not unlike Solana’s Pump Fun. Pump Fun has already been a massive success and is one of the key factors behind Solana’s hegemony over the meme coin sector. Popular tokens including Goatseus Maximus (GOAT), Peanut The Squirrel (PNUT) and Moo Deng (MOODENG) all saw explosive growth following their Pump Fun launches, with the first two even reaching multi-billion dollar valuations. Considering Ethereum’s vast user base, it wouldn’t be a surprise if Pepe’s Pump Pad saw similar success and delivered the next 100x meme coins. Moreover, PEPU’s community-centric tokenomics, transparent roadmap and successful security audits have made it a favourite among smart money investors. For instance, the project has allocated 30% of the token supply to staking rewards . Presale buyers can already stake their coins and earn attractive passive income, currently at an APY of over 55%. Is PEPU The Best Meme Coin To Buy? Prominent crypto investor ClayBro, who has over 130k subscribers on YouTube, called Pepe Unchained one of the best meme coins to buy today. In another video, he hinted that PEPU could create the next millionaires. Similarly, smart money investor Cilinix Crypto revealed on Sunday that he purchased even more Pepe Unchained ahead of its December launch on Tier-1 exchanges. He is also not the only one. Whales can’t get enough of this meme coin and aren’t waiting for its launch to ape in. $50k buys are daily occurrences for PEPU, with many deep-pocketed investors buying over $100k worth of the meme coin in a single transaction. These smart money investors are eyeing anywhere between 50x and 100x returns from Pepe Unchained. After all, PEPU remains a microcap meme coin despite its stellar presale performance. Several small-cap tokens have already delivered over 1000x returns amidst the extreme bull market euphoria that has currently gripped the market. There is also a strong speculation of Pepe Unchained being the next Binance listing. After all, the world’s leading crypto exchange has been listing low-cap meme coins with strong community support and in-demand utilities. PEPU checks all these boxes. Interested buyers can visit the project’s presale website and use the over-the-counter widget to buy the meme coin with just a few clicks. However, with just 11 days remaining in the presale end, they have an extremely short window to take advantage of the maximum discount.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 17:20:00

WisdomTree’s spot XRP ETF application, increasing odds of RLUSD stablecoin approval and strong futures market activity have pushed the XRP market capitalization past the $150 billion mark. However, XRP price predictions from experts suggest that sidelined investors and swing traders may get a better entry point to scale into their long positions, considering the token faces key resistance levels both in its USD and BTC charts. Why Is XRP Pumping Today? XRP’s price chart is the result of a bullish breakout from a 3-year consolidatory triangle. Prominent crypto analysts like Blockchainedbb reveal that the breakout is still playing out and could push the token price to $3.30 in the coming months. XRP has already flipped Solana and Tether in market capitalization, making it the 3rd largest cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin and Ethereum. WisdomTree’s S-1 application for an XRP spot ETF has also added to the FOMO, with all eyes on BlackRock and Fidelity. Similarly, the growing likelihood of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and strong futures market activity is also contributing to the bullish trajectory. The XRP price is now up by nearly 400% since Donald Trump’s victory. The anti-Ripple SEC Chair Gary Gensler is set to resign and be replaced by a pro-crypto head like Paul Atkins. As a result, the spot XRP ETF approval odds are extremely high, as is the likelihood of the SEC dropping or settling its lawsuit against Ripple. This would provide regulatory clarity, result in global partnerships and drive up the institutional demand for XRP. It is not without any reason that a few XRP price predictions have the token trading as high as $18 in the long term. Hey there. I hope you all are fine!Here is the weekly update on $XRP . People began to believe in XRP after our first target was eliminated at $1.88. Fibonacci's level stands at $5.85. People started copying our targets, but never mind—we have known their precision for almost… pic.twitter.com/J52Aj5a51C — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 2, 2024 XRP Price Prediction - Buy Now Or Wait? While XRP remains an attractive long-term investment, sidelined investors and swing traders can no longer underestimate the possibility of a short-term dip. For instance, the XRP price wicked above its 0.786 Fibonacci level in today’s rally. However, this is a multi-year resistance from the 2017-2018 cycle. It wouldn’t be a surprise if the token dips below this level before its upcoming weekly close. Similarly, a prominent analyst Jacob Canfield reveals that the XRPBTC chart has also hit a multi-year resistance. While a bullish breakout above could result in another 250% rally, the possibility of a bearish rejection cannot be ignored. Consequently, the risk-reward ratio isn’t favouring new long positions at the current price. Sidelined investors can wait for either a successful retest of the $2.50 support or a dip below the $2.00 price mark. Best Crypto To Buy Now? With XRP set to enter another consolidatory phase, the market capital would rotate to other crypto assets with bullish charts. For instance, legendary trader Bluntz reveals that the top Base meme coin Brett could hit a new all-time high in the coming days and enter price discovery. $BRETT just hit 2 billy mcap and flirting with an ATH breakout, quite surprised how little I see it talked about tbh. pic.twitter.com/lNJ0Wbnd4z — Bluntz (@Bluntz_Capital) December 1, 2024 Similarly, the Moo Deng price could hit a new all-time high as well following its Coinbase listing on Monday. The trending microcap meme coin Pepe Unchained (PEPU) is also nearing its highly-anticipated December launch. The Pepe Unchained presale has already raised nearly $65 million. With the ICO set to end in just 10 days, the whale buys are only ramping up, contributing to the hype and FOMO. PEPU’s in-demand utilities have already separated it from most new meme coins. Its upcoming Layer-2 chain will allow PEPU holders to benefit from extremely low trading costs as well as instant transactions. Meanwhile, the project is also launching Pepe’s Pump Pad, a two-click meme coin launchpad that is expected to be a direct competitor to Solana’s Pump Fun. Considering Ethereum’s vast user base, it wouldn’t be a surprise if Pepe’s Pump Pad is as successful as Pump Fun. With PEPU at the core of the ecosystem, it is no surprise that smart money investors are viewing it as one of the best crypto to buy right now. Many are even calling it the next 100x meme coin.

However, the bank noted that profitability remained significantly below pre-halving levels. “We estimate that Bitcoin miners earned an average of $52,000 per EH/s in daily block reward revenue in November, up 24% from October,” JPMorgan analysts Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote, noting the revenue increases miners achieved throughout the month. The increase in transaction fees following the November 5 U.S. presidential election contributed to what the bank calls “hashprice relief.” Hashprice is a key measure of mining profitability that combines block rewards and transaction fees. Related News: Why Has The Bitcoin Price Never Surpassed $100,000? Here's an Analyst's View The combined market value of the 14 publicly traded Bitcoin mining companies covered by JPMorgan rose 52% in November to $36.2 billion. JPMorgan also reported a 4% month-over-month increase in Bitcoin’s average network hashrate, which reached 731 exahashes per second (EH/s) in November. The company noted that Bitcoin’s annualized volatility also climbed in November, rising to 62% from 42% in October. This volatility presents both opportunities and challenges for miners, as sudden price swings can significantly impact profitability. Despite the improvements, the report noted that miners' gross profits remain around 50% below levels seen before Bitcoin's most recent halving event. *This is not investment advice.

This may reshape Brazil’s stance on cryptocurrencies as Brazil’s real is falling drastically. Proposed Ban in Focus The draft, published on Nov. 29, bars VASPs from transferring stablecoins denominated in foreign currencies to self-custodial wallets. The consultation period runs up until Feb. 28, 2025. “The provider of virtual asset services shall not transfer virtual assets denominated in foreign currency to a self-custodial portfolio,” the document reads. Stricter Oversight in the Cryptocurrency Space The central bank’s proposal comes in line with the government’s broader push to increase oversight of the foreign exchange market and track Brazilian capital abroad. Such measures follow 2022 regulations that targeted virtual asset service providers. Key components of the proposal include: The expansion of foreign exchange rules to cover crypto payments, custody, and transactions. VASPs will be compelled to provide the central bank with comprehensive client information and data on transfers. Why Target Self-Custodial Wallets? Self-custodial wallets allow users to manage their assets independently, without any third-party interference. This makes them, by nature, censorship-resistant. According to proponents, though regulations can hamper its use, an outright ban on self-custodial wallets is all but impossible. “They’re closing the exits while BRL is collapsing,” said Carol Souza, co-founder of Area Bitcoin. Economic and Market Implications The proposal comes as the Brazilian real suffered a dramatic decline, falling 23% against the US dollar in 2023 and reaching an all-time low of 6.09 reals per dollar. This has driven many Brazilians toward stablecoins like Tether (USDt) to hedge against currency devaluation. Brazil’s Key Role in Global Stablecoin Markets Brazil is the second-biggest market for stablecoin transactions, as 59.8% of its crypto market is covered by stablecoins. Over the past year, the country has recorded $90 billion in crypto inflows, just behind Argentina’s $91 billion.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2024-12-02 17:32:50

A wallet tagged as ""U.S. Government: Silk Road DOJ Confiscated Funds"" transferred 19,800 bitcoin on Monday to a fresh address with no prior history of transactions, blockchain data by Arkham Intelligence showed. The funds were then deposited to Coinbase Prime. The transfer likely indicates that the government is preparing to sell or has already sold the assets. Earlier instances of government selling this year sparked sizable selloffs in bitcoin, but the action today — so far — has been more muted, with the price dipping a bit more than 1% to the current $95,800 since the news hit. Following this move, the U.S. government still holds $18 billion worth of seized crypto assets, per Arkham. The Department of Justice announced in 2022 that it seized over 50,000 BTC and arrested James Zhong, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud after the government alleged he manipulated the transaction system of dark web market Silk Road in 2012. Last month, U.S. district court of Northern California requested involved parties to ""stipulate that government may liquidate some or all"" of the forfeited digital assets related to Silk Road and holding on the funds while an ongoing FOIA action resolves. The last confirmed sale of Silk Road assets by the government was in March 2023 selling nearly 10,000 BTC for $216 million, court filings show. The government laid out plans in the filing to sell the remaining assets in four tranches during that year, but there wasn't follow-up communication about any sales since then. Earlier this year, the U.S. Marshals Service, a division of the DOJ, announced a partnership with Coinbase Prime to ""safeguard and trade"" the government's large-cap digital assets.",Markets|Silk Road|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-02 17:33:18

The trend still looks bullish in the long term but will likely correct lower before resuming the rally. Bitcoin’s trend remains bullish on the daily chart but the price looks stalled over the past week after several failed attempts to push above the psychological $100k level. The newly tapped all-time high has been an obstacle to Bitcoin’s next move for almost two weeks. Meanwhile, the bulls are still eyeing the mentioned psychological level, but they appear weak at the moment. This level should manifest when they return. While the bulls continue to take a break, regrouping for the next leg up, Bitcoin’s lost buzz and initiated drops today. It currently trades in the $95,000 range as it forms a double-top pattern on the daily chart. A further decline could bring a major correction in the short term before skyrocketing to a new ATH. Losing momentum should provide more opportunity to reaccumulate for bigger moves. That said, the temporal halt in bullish has given life to many lower-cap altcoins in the past week. If Bitcoin continues to hover, we can expect more rallies amongst some undervalued assets before deciding on where next to head. For now, the bull season remains intact. BTC’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Now that BTC is back in the $95,000 range, we may see more sell-offs in the coming days. The closest support level lies at $90,791 – last week’s low. If this support fails to produce a bounce, $85,072 and $81,500 are the next level to keep in mind. Towards the upside, Bitcoin must break above the current $99,588 high to sustain bullish momentum. Tapping $100k, the next level to consider for buying would be $103,000 Key Resistance Levels: $99,588, $100,000, $103,000 Key Support Levels: $90,791, $85,072, $81,500 Spot Price: $95,200 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

However, certain analysts believe this could be the calm before the storm, and they even envision a new all-time high for the popular meme coin. SHIB’s Monday Downfall CryptoPotato reported yesterday the positive price developments around the second-biggest meme coin. At the time, SHIB was the top performer from the larger-cap alts, having surged by over 15% on a 24-hour scale. As a result, SHIB skyrocketed to its highest levels since March this year of over $0.000033. However, the entire crypto landscape changed on Monday, with many assets plunging hard. Bitcoin, for example, dumped from over $98,000 to under $95,000 amid some potential profit taking from whales. Shiba Inu’s largest native token was not spared either, dumping by nearly 10% on a daily scale to well below $0.00003. However, popular X analyst Diamond-Hands noted that SHIB’s correction could be over now, and the asset seems primed for a new wave up from this point. Correction done on $SHIB WE MIGHT GET ANOTHER WAVE UP FROM HERE #ShibaInu https://t.co/Buw6BtI6CV pic.twitter.com/h6M0Uwz6jB — DIAMOND-HANDS (@TamngwaB) December 2, 2024 Ali, another well-known technical analyst, has $0.000037 in sight and believes the asset could reach that level as long as it remains above the crucial support at $0.000025, which still holds. Naturally, there are certain SHIB-related pages that continue to be highly bullish about the asset’s perspective in the near future, highlighting the potential of reaching a new all-time high. To do so, SHIB would need to triple its price from its current levels as its ATH stands at $0.00008616, according to CoinGecko. Major Strength Javon Marks told his nearly 50,000 followers on X that the meme coin’s rally over the weekend had confirmed “another bull pattern,” which shows its potential to be “further joining the bull show.” As such, the analyst noted that $0.000081 is still in play, meaning that SHIB could soon indeed target that aforementioned ATH. $SHIB (Shiba Inu), after recently confirming another bull pattern, looks to be further joining the bull show as prices are now showing signs of MAJOR STRENGTH!

XRP dropped out of the top three in December 2020 when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple, alleging it conducted an “unregistered digital asset securities offering.” With the SEC lawsuit nearing resolution and Ripple securing multiple legal wins in 2024, XRP has surged. Its price saw a notable spike in November following Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election. After lagging behind cryptocurrencies like Tether (USDT), Binance’s BNB, Solana (SOL), and Circle’s USDC for years, XRP has now climbed back to the third spot, following Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). “This is how it looked before Dec. 22, 2020,” pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton remarked on X. The lawsuit initially caused XRP’s price to plummet from $0.50 to $0.17, erasing over $15 billion in market value. “While the price recovered, XRP spent the next four years at the #7 spot,” Fox Business reporter Eleanor Terrett noted in a Dec. 1 post. Despite its decline, XRP consistently remained within the top 10 cryptocurrencies, signaling its resilience. In November, XRP gained further traction online, with Google searches for “XRP” surpassing those for “crypto” multiple times. According to Google Trends, XRP even briefly overtook Ether (ETH) in search popularity but has yet to surpass Bitcoin. To overtake Ether in market capitalization, XRP would need to rise significantly. Crypto trader Christopher Jaszczynski, known as MMCrypto, predicts, “XRP will flip ETH when its price surges to $7.75.” At present, Ether’s market cap exceeds XRP by 219%, suggesting that XRP still has a considerable gap to close before challenging ETH for the second spot.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 17:35:00

This remarkable rally reflects growing bullish sentiment across the sector, drawing renewed interest from investors in alternative digital assets. ADA has demonstrated robust upward momentum, making it a key performer in the market’s resurgence. With increasing optimism, speculation arises whether Cardano could achieve another significant rally, potentially surging 230% by December’s end. Is a 230% Cardano Price Rally on the Horizon This December? Cardano price is gaining attention as traders analyze its price movements and predict potential future trends. However, speculation about a massive 230% price rally appears unlikely. Current market signals suggest a possible correction instead of the anticipated upward surge. The provided analysis highlights a critical support level of $1.10. A sustained drop below this level would signify a bearish trend shift. If the price falls further and breaks under $1.03, it could confirm a bearish breakout, potentially driving the value down to $0.88. Such a move would represent a significant 20% correction, countering the bullish expectations. Even if Cardano manages to break out from its current consolidation, the likelihood of achieving a 230% rally seems remote. Source: X ADA Price Soars 10%; What Next for Token? At the time of writing, the ADA price has surged by 12%, trading at $1.20. The Cardano price demonstrated impressive performance over the past 24 hours, rallying from a low of $1.06 to a high of $1.21. The gain signals renewed investor confidence in the cryptocurrency, placing it back in the spotlight among top-performing assets. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 81, the asset currently sits in overbought territory, suggesting potential caution for investors. The top altcoin is nearing a critical resistance level at $1.3, supported by bullish momentum that signals the potential for further gains. A successful breakthrough could propel the cryptocurrency toward the $2 mark, its next significant resistance point. Cardano Price Chart: TradingView The whale activity surrounding Cardano price has surged, with transactions exceeding $100K, alongside ADA’s rising price. This growing activity highlights increasing interest from large investors. Notably, ADA’s price gains correlate with heightened whale transaction counts, reflecting positive sentiment. This trend underscores the significance of institutional involvement in Cardano’s ecosystem. Cardano’s recent surge has captured attention, but a 230% rally seems overly optimistic. While bullish trends persist, overbought indicators and resistance levels suggest caution. Investors should monitor key levels as the market unfolds, balancing optimism with realistic expectations.

The price is down but bigger moves lie ahead as it targets the current high while gathering liquidity. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum did not slow down buying in the past week despite witnessing volatility contraction on the way up. The contraction, which started from around $3,000, suggests a serious liquidity gathering on the daily timeframe. From the look of things, the price will likely explode massively to a new all-time high soon. As seen on the daily chart, the price broke above a monthly resistance level last week and increased steadily to a daily high of $3,760. It saw a rejection there and dropped below $3,600, looking for a retest. Rolling back gains could trigger a small price retracement, capable of slowing down the bullish rally. The $3,000 level is a key support to watch for such a rebound. Failure to rebound could cause more setbacks in the market before the bulls step back into action. If July’s high provides support, ETH may continue to gather momentum until the price breaks out of the current all-time high. The price currently appeared weak following the latest drops. While the bears are showing interest, more drops can be expected if the supply level increases. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Pushing above the current daily high, ETH is likely to encounter minor resistance at $4,000 before reclaiming the $4,094 resistance with a major break out to $5,000 For a potential pullback, the immediate support level to consider for drops is $3,497. Below it lies the $3,255 support. If the price further dips, the next level to watch is $3,015. Key Resistance Levels: $3,760, $4,094, $5,000 Key Support Levels: $3,497, $3,255, $3,015 Spot Price: $3,595 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Just last week, BTFD Coin burst onto the scene with a presale that’s already raised over $500,000, zooming through 25% of its 16-stage journey in a single day. Meanwhile, Bonk has seen its popularity surge on social media despite recent price struggles, and Fartcoin is gaining traction as a quirky but promising meme coin. If you’re wondering which of these might be the best crypto coin to buy, you’re not alone. Over the years, meme coins have become more than just digital laughs; they’ve turned into serious profit engines. From Dogecoin’s early hype to Shiba Inu’s jaw-dropping run, meme coins have taught us that community and timing can trump even the best tech. Now, BTFD Coin is taking the meme game to a whole new level with a killer P2E game, juicy staking rewards, and a “Bulls Squad” community that’s all about flipping market dips into wins. Let’s break down why BTFD Coin, Bonk, and Fartcoin are trending as top contenders for the best crypto coin to buy in 2024. Spoiler alert: there’s a lot to get hyped about. BTFD Coin: Flipping Market Lows into Big Wins BTFD Coin has wasted no time grabbing the spotlight. With a presale price starting at $0.000004, it’s now in its sixth stage at $0.000058. Over 10 billion coins have been sold, raising more than $500,000 in just days. That’s a staggering pace for a newcomer, but it’s not just the numbers that have people talking. It’s the vibe. BTFD—short for “Buy The F***ing Dip”—isn’t just a coin; it’s a rallying cry for traders who thrive in chaos. The presale’s momentum has been nothing short of electric. Within 24 hours, BTFD blitzed through 25% of its 16-stage presale journey, raising $150,000 in that first-day frenzy. Early adopters are already seeing the potential for huge returns, especially with the price set to hit $0.0006 once it’s listed. That’s a 10x gain for those who got in at the ground floor. Take this example: Imagine you dropped $4,000 in Stage 5 when the price was $0.00005. That would’ve scored you 80 million BTFD Coins. By the end of the presale, at $0.0006 per coin, your $4,000 investment balloons to $48,000. Let that sink in. What really sets BTFD apart is its ecosystem. A P2E game is in the works, designed to keep the community engaged and earning. There’s also a staking rewards system offering a sweet 90% APY. And with the “Bulls Squad” pushing its ethos of turning market downturns into golden opportunities, BTFD isn’t just a coin; it’s a movement. If you’re looking for the best crypto coin to buy this December, it’s hard to argue against the numbers and the vibe. Bonk: Social Media Sensation with Challenges Bonk has had a rollercoaster year. As Solana’s flagship meme coin, it’s built a strong community driven by social media hype and grassroots campaigns. But let’s be real: it’s not all smooth sailing. Bonk recently saw a 23% price drop in just a week, thanks to overall market volatility. Still, its die-hard investors are holding out hope for a comeback. What keeps Bonk in the conversation is its foundation as a community-first project. Social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit are buzzing with Bonk memes and discussions. But despite its popularity, Bonk’s lack of utility compared to newer meme coins is a glaring issue. Investors are starting to look elsewhere, with many turning to upcoming ICOs like FXGuys for potentially bigger returns. That said, Bonk’s volatility could still appeal to short-term traders looking to capitalise on quick price swings. If you’ve got the stomach for risk, Bonk’s social media buzz and speculative nature might just make it the best crypto coin to buy for a fast flip. But keep in mind, its long-term growth will depend on whether the team can deliver meaningful updates to its utility and ecosystem. Fartcoin: Quirky, Bold, and Full of Potential Fartcoin is exactly what it sounds like—a meme coin with a name that’ll make you laugh out loud. But don’t let its humour fool you. This quirky project is quietly building a loyal community and gaining traction in the meme coin space. Its roadmap is ambitious, featuring plans for community-driven initiatives, partnerships, and even a Fart-themed NFT collection. What’s got everyone talking about Fartcoin is its ability to combine internet culture with solid engagement strategies. It’s the kind of project that appeals to Gen Z and Millennials who value humour as much as they do potential profits. And with its developers teasing upcoming collaborations with influencers and meme creators, Fartcoin’s star is on the rise. But here’s the kicker: Fartcoin’s community engagement is off the charts. Whether it’s meme contests, charity drives, or just a constant stream of hilarious content, Fartcoin knows how to keep its audience hooked. While it may not yet have the financial backing of projects like BTFD, its charm and grassroots appeal make it a dark horse in the race for the best crypto coin to buy in 2024. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Bonk, and Fartcoin each bring something unique to the table. BTFD Coin’s explosive presale growth and innovative ecosystem make it the frontrunner for life-changing returns. Bonk’s social media-driven popularity keeps it in the spotlight, even as it faces challenges. And Fartcoin’s quirky branding and community engagement make it a fresh and exciting contender. Don’t wait too long to make your move. The crypto market never sleeps, and opportunities like these don’t last forever. Join the BTFD Coin presale now and secure your spot in one of the most exciting crypto projects of 2024.

But the message ended with a ‘stay tuned’ hint. Using the brand of the now-defunct corporation also led to the creation of numerous Enron-themed meme tokens on Pump.fun. Rumors are emerging from an X account using the @Enron handle, hinting at a possible new token. The account itself states it has not issued its own crypto token, but leads to a site with a one-week countdown to an undisclosed event. Soon after posting the token teaser, the @Enron handle deleted the message. Just hours after the message spread, Community Notes outed the content as a crypto scam masquerading as the bankrupted energy corporation. However, the message already had an effect on the meme token market. The real Enron, notorious for its accounting scandal in the early 2000s, warned through its X account that it did not launch any type of coin or token. On the other hand, Enron hinted the possibility is not out of the question. The newly active Enron account had to explain its plans for the crypto space, after receiving thousands of queries on creating a digital token. For now, there is no official asset or contract address tied to Enron. The speculations around an eventual token launch follow the announcement of Enron’s plan to rebuild as a clean energy company. On Monday, Enron sent out a press release announcing its relaunch as a company aiming to solve the global energy crisis. The press release did not mention a new coin or token but accelerated the speculation and new asset launches through Pump.fun. The only thing tangentially related to a token is a mention that Enron would use ‘permissionless innovation’ and decentralized technology. The account using the brand of Enron also seems to be aware of token scams, since it ended its recent X announcements with a warning not to follow any links or offers on behalf of its brand. Enron still holds the record for the biggest corporate bankruptcy at $63.4B, far surpassing the scale of any crypto crash. Is there really an Enron token? Token creators on Pump.fun are extremely fast, and have already created at least a dozen assets under the same ticker. These tokens vary, with some appearing official and others humorously themed, such as referencing Enron’s infamous accounting scandals. The crypto community is well aware that the Enron moniker was a publicity stunt but ran with it as the next hot theme on Pump.fun. There are several contenders for the most curious token based on Enron’s fame. The first one is the OG Enron token, created more than eight months ago. That token has not left the bonding curve, with just $10.4K in liquidity. An early asset with claims of being the OG token has also surfaced, though with only 267 holders and $23K in available liquidity. Several tokens with a non-serious profile were also created, all holding $6.4K in liquidity. The last such token was launched seven days ago, before Enron’s relaunch message. The other contender is the most liquid Solana-based token tapping Enron’s fame. The asset still holds only $134K in liquidity, but it has at least graduated to Raydium. There are multiple competing tokens, but some feature more active wallet clusters and at least create the impression of activity. Social media users noted one of the tokens , with 2,344 users, pumped just days before Enron sent out its press release and started producing X content. There is no way to know who pumped those tokens, which take very little to rally and line up among trending assets. The appearance of a copycat trend further complicates the choice of which version to support. Some Enron-themed tokens on Pump.fun have reached market caps exceeding $500 million, despite having low liquidity. These assets appear to attract traders with a sense of financial nihilism, who are more interested in pumping prices for symbolic or ironic reasons than for long-term value. There has been talk of creating another irrational cult to pump a selected Enron token version and put it among the more valuable memes. For now, no Enron-themed tokens have found market makers, and are just another hot short-term trend among meme assets. The tokens launched at a time when the meme market recovered above a total market cap of $123B , while funds rolled over from former stars into a new batch of rising tokens.

Blockchain data from Arkham Intelligence revealed that a wallet labeled “US Government: Silk Road DOJ Seized Funds” moved 19,800 BTC to a new address before depositing the funds to Coinbase Prime. The wallet had no previous transaction history, leading to speculation that the government may be preparing to sell the assets. Historically, government-seized BTC sales have triggered significant market reactions. Earlier this year, similar sales led to sharp declines in Bitcoin prices. However, today the impact of the transfer was more subtle, with Bitcoin prices falling just over 1% to around $95,800 following the news. Related News: JPMorgan Releases New Report on Bitcoin Network Following Recent Volatility Despite this transaction, the U.S. government still holds approximately $18 billion worth of confiscated cryptocurrency, according to Arkham Intelligence. The BTC in question stems from a 2022 Department of Justice (DOJ) case in which over 50,000 BTC was seized and a Silk Road user, James Zhong, was arrested. Zhong pleaded guilty to wire fraud after authorities accused him of abusing Silk Road’s transaction system in 2012. In November, a U.S. District Court in Northern California allowed the government to liquidate some or all of the Silk Road-related BTC while awaiting the resolution of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit. *This is not investment advice.

These allegations culminated in a four-month prison sentence for CZ and a personal fine of $50 million. The exchange he founded, Binance, faced an even heftier penalty, with fines totaling $4.3 billion.

He had highlighted that it was not a measure of success, but rather an indictment of oversight gone terribly wrong, driven by perverse incentives. The SEC under Gensler has faced widespread criticism over its hostile approach towards the crypto industry. The agency, under Gensler, sued Ripple in December 2020, alleging it of violating the law by selling XRP without first registering it as a security. The agency then filed lawsuits against several digital asset companies, including Coinbase Global and Binance Holdings. Light At The End? Analyst anticipate that legal battles between crypto companies and the SEC may be “dismissed or settled” under the Trump administration. Recently, the former CFTC Chair Chris Giancarlo also urged regulatory agencies to drop several cases, including Ripple’s. In a recent Fox Business interview on Nov. 26, Giancarlo said, “It’s time for regulatory agencies to drop a lot of these cases.” When asked if the SEC should drop the Ripple case specifically, Giancarlo responded: “I think they should.” Recently, amidst the news of Gensler stepping down in January has contributed to XRP’s price increase. Digital assets flagged as “unregistered securities” in previous SEC litigation, such as ADA and SOL, have also benefited from this positive sentiment. “XRP was in an accumulation phase for nearly three years—around 900 days. The duration of such a phase often determines the strength of the subsequent rally, so it’s no surprise that from November 4, XRP has surged around 404%,” noted Arthur Azizov, the chief executive of crypto exchange and payment processor B2BinPay, as per a Forbes report. The improving regulatory landscape and its immense potential could further push the XRP price beyond its 2017 bull run all-time high in 2025.

This comes after the Litecoin price bounced hard from moving average support, bolstered by XRP’s strong performance, which saw XRP overtake SOL on the Weekend . Breaking to the upside comes after days of sustained ascendant moves, propped up by tight support from the 20DMA since the beginning of November. With the 20DMA now left standing at $108, it appears Litecoin is in the midst of a bullish rally, with price action currently probing resistance at $125 after initial rejection was met with a well-defended consolidation above $115 by holders. The upside move has seen the RSI over-heat, however, this is rapidly cooling down to lower levels amid the consolidation, suggesting upside movements could be on the cards soon. As it stands, upside targeting remains above resistance at $130 (a possible +9.4% move), while downside risk could see LTC plummet back down to 20DMA support at $108.5 (a potential -9.17% drop). This leaves Litecoin with a mediocre risk: reward ratio of just 1.03 on the short-time frame, which is relatively unalluring for most investors, yet, this doesn’t mean there’s not exciting opportunities available in the crypto market today.

In a post on the social media platform X, Armstrong says that the US anti-money laundering (AML) policies should be reviewed by President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) – a new agency that aims to reduce government waste. “Anti Money Laundering (AML) regulations have been a policy failure. They cost ~$213 billion annually, harm legitimate consumers (as we’ve seen with these de-banking stories), and only manage to stop ~0.2% of illicit activity according to the UN. Sounds like a job for DOGE.” Armstrong also suggests having a “sunset provision” on all laws to automatically retire them after a certain amount of time unless Congress votes to keep them. The Coinbase CEO also shares data that only 0.05% to 0.2% of criminal proceeds are intercepted, indicating that over 99% of illicit funds successfully evade detection. In addition, banks have shelled out $321 billion in fines since 2008 for compliance failures and crimes related to money laundering. Armstrong recently alleged that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren was likely involved in the de-banking of 30 tech and crypto founders. “Can confirm this is true. It was one of the most unethical and un-American things that happened in the Biden administration, and my guess is we’ll find Elizabeth Warren’s fingerprints all over it (Biden himself was probably unaware).” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Following the resignation announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler and Ripple’s significant legal victory against the SEC earlier this year, XRP has experienced an extraordinary surge. Brad Garlinghouse, alongside Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty and lawyer Bill Morgan, has emphasized that these developments have set the stage for unprecedented growth in the crypto industry. Ripple CEO Hints At Main Reason Behind XRP Rally Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse pointed to the resignation of SEC Chair Gary Gensler as a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market, including Ripple. Gensler, whose tenure has been marked by aggressive regulatory actions against crypto, announced he would step down in January 2025. This decision coincides with the election of pro-crypto U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to foster a more favorable regulatory environment. Garlinghouse tweeted, “After Gensler, all boats rise,” referring to the industry-wide optimism sparked by this leadership change. Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty echoed this sentiment, stating, “The only ‘efforts of others’ that truly moved crypto markets—by causing massive and prolonged artificial suppression—were those of the SEC.” Many in the industry see Gensler’s departure as marking the end of what they view as an era of legal hostility toward cryptocurrency projects. XRP’s Bullish Momentum Hits Multi-Year Highs XRP has reached a six-year price high, climbing to $2.71, with a market cap exceeding $150 billion. Ripple’s legal victory against the SEC earlier in the year was a critical turning point for the asset, cementing its status as a leader in the crypto market. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse attributed much of XRP’s rally to renewed investor confidence following the legal win and broader market optimism. Ripple lawyer Bill Morgan highlighted the SEC’s misstep in its handling of the Ripple case, stating, “The SEC made a huge mistake not seeking a penalty in XRP rather than USD.” This legal outcome has energized Ripple and its supporters, with the XRP community celebrating the end of what they perceive as a lengthy period of regulatory suppression. Institutional Demand Drives Market Gains The growing demand for XRP among institutional investors has also played a significant role in its price surge. Coinbase, one of the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchanges, reported a price premium for XRP over the past 30 days, indicating strong buying interest from U.S.-based investors. According to Ki Young Ju, CEO of CryptoQuant, this premium has ranged from 3% to 13%, underscoring robust demand for the digital asset. Meanwhile, Ripple’s market momentum has encouraged traditional financial firms to explore XRP-related products. Investment management company WisdomTree recently filed for an XRP Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) with the SEC, joining other firms such as Bitwise and 21Shares.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) says the banking giant has admitted it’s liable for failing to discover and stop misconduct by its relationship managers. The agency says the managers provided incorrect information to clients while executing 24 over-the-counter bond transactions, which resulted in those customers being overcharged. According to the MAS, JPMorgan did not have a proper system in place to make sure its managers complied with the predetermined client spread agreements. “The bank has refunded the overcharged fees to affected clients. The bank has also enhanced its pricing frameworks and internal controls to prevent the recurrence of such misconduct.” JPMorgan says the issue affected a “very small” percentage of total trades processed. “In 2020, after completing our internal review, JPMorgan Private Bank undertook a comprehensive update to its internal controls, monitoring and training framework to ensure our trade governance, pricing transparency and compliance principles continue to be upheld.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

In total, MicroStrategy now owns over $38 billion in bitcoin. Other companies are now starting to copy the Microstrategy play book and run their strategy of accumulating bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Saylor even presented to Microsoft’s CEO and board of directors on why they should adopt a bitcoin standard. Microsoft is the third largest company in the world by market cap, and is voting on whether or not they should add bitcoin to their balance sheet. Insane! Publicly traded bitcoin miner MARA is also copying MicroStrategy’s playbook and announced today that they’re raising up to $805 million in debt to buy more bitcoin. Do you get it yet? This is not going to stop any time soon. We have officially entered a new era of bitcoin accumulation that is being led by these large corporations. Saylor, MicroStrategy, and other companies are going to scoop up every available coin they can get their hands on. And if they’re as convicted as MicroStrategy is — they’re not selling. That’s not even to mention the other big players now (BlackRock, Fidelity, ARK, etc) buying up coins for their ETFs. The amount of demand for bitcoin today is surreal.

I’m not saying or advising anyone to take on debt to buy bitcoin, but rather adopt it as your primary savings account and sit back and take in all the benefits of holding bitcoin — especially in regards to holding your own private keys. The plan is simple: buy bitcoin, secure it safely, and hold it for the long term. If you sell, you will be selling directly into the hands of MicroStrategy and every other company running this playbook. This article is a Take .

As the PolitiFi scene continues to carve out its niche in 2024, FreeDum Fighters is quickly emerging as the top token to buy in December, especially as it attracts politically inclined crypto enthusiasts looking for massive gains. Positioning itself as a key player beyond the election cycle, FreeDum Fighters is evolving to tap into the broader meme coin sector. Its growth is set to continue as the political landscape shifts, particularly with President-elect Trump’s assumption of office next year. This evolution makes it a top pick for investors looking to capitalize on political momentum and the broader meme coin market. With only five days remaining in the presale, the opportunity to buy $ DUM at its current price of $0.000113 is rapidly closing. The price is set to rise as the presale enters its final stages – don’t miss out on your chance to get in before it’s too late. Politifi tokens reshape the crypto landscape, with FreeDum Fighters leading the charge The PolitiFi sector has dramatically impacted the crypto world in 2024. With meme coins now valued at nearly half a billion dollars and recent 24-hour trading volumes hitting over $355 million, it’s clear this subsector is here to stay. Tokens like MAGA Hat ($MAGA) and Fight to MAGA ($FIGHT) have posted solid gains of 23.2% and 9.2%, respectively, while Patriot ($PATRIOT) has surged by 33% over the past week. Even in a broader meme coin market that dipped 0.83% in the past 24 hours, PolitiFi tokens are showing impressive resilience. Source: CoinGecko / MAGA Hat The appeal of PolitiFi tokens lies in their ability to inject humor into the often intense and divisive world of politics. Tokens like Doland Tremp ($TREMP), Joe Boden ($BODEN), and Kamala Horris ($KAMA) – which intentionally twist the names of political figures with bastardized cartoon representations – have captured attention for their satire. And no other meme coin project understands this blend of humor and politics like FreeDum Fighters. FreeDum Fighters pivots back to its PolitiFi roots (i.e., meme coins) by incorporating Dogecoin and Pepe. Dogecoin joins the MAGATRON and Dark MAGA cohort, while Pepe aligns with Sleepy Joe and Kamacop 9000. Through these pairings, FreeDum Fighters taps into a unique, meme-driven political dynamic that positions itself at the forefront as the PolitiFi landscape evolves post-2024. Yet, this is just one part of the story. FreeDum Fighters: Where political stakes meet crypto – a dynamic ecosystem for debate and rewards Since launching its presale in late October, FreeDum Fighters has proven it’s not just a meme coin – it’s a platform where political stakes meet crypto. Like Polymarket, it offers a space to engage with political dynamics, but with a uniquely meme-driven twist. The characters MAGATRON and Kamacap 9000 represent two staking pools, allowing $DUM holders to stake their tokens and earn rewards. While Kamacap 9000 boasted a higher APY due to fewer tokens competing for rewards, MAGATRON still dominates despite its lower returns. Why? Because for these investors, it’s not just about financial rewards – it’s about backing a political cause they believe in, one that views Trump as a stronger force for the future of crypto than Harris. Beyond the staking pools, FreeDum Fighters is a dynamic space where politically inclined crypto enthusiasts can passionately debate their views. Users can engage in debates on its social media platforms, with the most compelling arguments earning additional $DUM tokens. This makes it a truly interactive platform where financial and political engagement go hand-in-hand. This is what makes FreeDum Fighters a complete ecosystem for settling the most contentious political score. Popular crypto influencer Borch Crypto has provided an in-depth review of the presale to his 85,800 YouTube subscribers in the video below: Join the PolitiFi movement with $DUM Indeed, the PolitiFi landscape is evolving, and FreeDum Fighters is the only project primed for this shift. To join the movement, secure your $DUM tokens before the presale ends in five days by visiting the official FreeDum Fighters website and connecting your wallet. FreeDum Fighters offers multi-chain support, allowing you to purchase $DUM tokens with various options, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Base, and Solana. Accepted payment methods include ETH, BSC, BASE, SOL, USDT, and USDC. With a strong emphasis on security, FreeDum Fighters’ smart contract has been fully audited by top firms like Coinsult and SolidProof , ensuring the code is secure and error-free.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 18:04:00

This decision underscores Coinbase’s commitment to offering a diverse range of digital assets, providing traders with broader opportunities for engagement in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Moo Deng Price Surges 70% Following Coinbase Listing Plan Following Coinbase announcement , Moo Deng (MOODENG) experienced a remarkable 70.31% surge in price within 24 hours, reaching $0.6123. The sharp increase reflects a boost in market enthusiasm, likely spurred by Coinbase’s influence as a major trading platform. The trading activity surrounding Moo Deng also experienced a notable uptick. Within the same 24-hour period, the token’s trading volume rose by 400%, reaching $751 million. This rise indicates heightened investor interest and a wave of activity among traders. However, it is essential to note that while the exchange has included Moo Deng in its roadmap, trading and transfers for the token are not supported until the official listing is announced. This practice ensures compliance with regulatory and technical preparations required for asset integration. The Moo Deng meme coin operates on the Solana blockchain, a network known for its efficiency and scalability. Simultaneously, the top exchange also included QCAD, an ERC-20 token from the Ethereum blockchain, in its roadmap. Experimental Label and Asset Hub Standards More so, Coinbase recently introduced an Experimental label, which may apply to newly listed assets, including Moo Deng. This label indicates assets that are in the early stages of adoption or testing, providing transparency to users about the nature of the assets. In line with its Asset Hub initiative, Coinbase aims to list every asset that meets its legal, compliance, and technical security standards. These criteria are focused on the integrity of the platform rather than the market capitalization or popularity of the tokens. Last month, FLOKI price rallied after being added to the top exchange listing roadmap, reaching a five-month high. The inclusion sparked increased interest among traders, with the token gaining 12% in 24 hours and nearly doubling over the week. Most recently, the Solana meme coin price soared 26% following its listing on the Asian crypto exchange OKX. At press time, Moo Deng (MOODENG) price experienced a slight decline but remained strong, trading at $0.5402. The token has maintained significant gains following the announcement, with a 50% increase in price over the last 24 hours.

The head of business development at Libeara, Alexandre Deschatres, reportedly disclosed this in an interview with Hong Kong newspaper Xin Bao. According to the reports , the tokenization platform will launch the fund on Ethereum in partnership with FundBridge Capital, a licensed fund manager in Singapore, and Wellington Asset Management in the US. Deschartres stated that the fund will launch on the Ethereum mainnet, and they will first evaluate the liquidity of US Treasury bonds before proceeding with the launch. If it goes as planned, this will add another to the growing list of tokenized real-world assets (RWA) issued through Libeara since the platform launched in 2023. While details of the new money market fund remain uncertain, Libeara has a strong relationship with FundBridge Capital. They launched the first tokenized Singapore-Dollar Government Bond Fund for eligible investors in 2023. Since then, it has been used to issue other tokenized funds on Ethereum, with plans to expand to other chains, including Avalanche, Solana, and Arbitrum. The platform provides the technology needed to onboard accredited investors, allowing them to subscribe to and redeem units of tokenized funds directly on the chain. The enterprise-grade tokenization platform leverages the expertise and technology of blockchain-native companies such as Fireblocks, Fazz, Chainalysis, Letsbloom, and Chekk. The tokenization sector continues to grow Meanwhile, the announcement highlights the continued growth of tokenization, particularly among traditional financial institutions. Demand for tokenized RWA has risen over the last few months, with US treasury bonds accounting for a significant portion of the total tokenized RWA. This is due to the participation of major firms such as BlackRock, Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), and Franklin Templeton, as well as the emergence of a more crypto-friendly administration in the US. Many believe that regulatory clarity around stablecoins and cryptocurrencies will boost tokenization efforts. Interestingly, the total value of RWA on-chain increased by 2.33% to reach $13.54 billion in the last 30 days, while asset holders also increased by 2.46% to reach 66,617. However, this is a mere drop in the ocean compared to the projections of many financial institutions, including Standard Chartered, which expects the sector to be worth $30 trillion by 2030. Regulators embrace tokenization in several forms While the $30 trillion projection may seem like a moonshot, recent regulatory developments suggest it is possible. Spanish financial regulator CNMV recently approved the first tokenization issuance in the country, certifying Ursus-3 Capital as Entity Responsible for Registration and Registration (ERIR). The firm, in partnership with Onyze, will now be able to facilitate the issuance of on-chain tokenized assets on distributed ledger technology (DLT) networks for other companies within the country. Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) also recently introduced the Digital Bond Grant Scheme (DBGS) to incentivize the growth of tokenized bonds. The grant, up to 2.5 million Hong Kong dollars ($321,200), is offered to eligible issuers of digital bonds in the city. Beyond that, there are expectations that regulatory clarity on stablecoins, which is already happening worldwide, could also boost the growth of the tokenization sector as regulated stablecoins will be used for real-time settlement of on-chain transactions. In Europe, this clarity has already arrived in the Market in Crypto Assets (MiCA) Act, which provides guidelines for issuing electronic money tokens (EMTs). Although the US does not yet have clear regulations on stablecoins, many expect this to happen as soon as 2025. Unsurprisingly, analysts have predicted that stablecoins will see massive growth in adoption over the next few years and could soon make up 10% of the US M2 and foreign exchange transactions.

A yield-bearing Ethereum ETF would be a far more attractive proposition than the current Ethereum ETF to many traditional investors and could bolster inflows.

As a result of growing bullish narratives surrounding Ethereum and its ecosystem moving forward, few would be surprised to see the price charge above $4,000 this month and mount a challenge of the 2021 all-time highs in the $4,800s. If prior altcoin seasons are any guide, the Ethereum price could charge more than 2x higher from its prior record highs and on towards $10,000. So that could mean gains of around 3x are possible for ETH from current levels. Impressive stuff. However, for some in crypto markets, this upside potential won’t be enough, with many investors instead hunting for the next 100x project that will make them rich. In their hunt for outsized returns, these investors often turn to the micro-cap meme coin markets. Many get caught up in FOMO and end up getting burnt by scam meme coins and pump-and-dump schemes. A better option might be to invest in meme coin presales that are already seeing surging momentum and interest. One of the top projects being watched by investors at crypto news.com is a “hidden” meme coin called Flockerz (FLOCK) that has been going under the radar up until now. Here is everything you need to know about this exciting new vote-to-earn DAO-powered meme coin, and why analysts at crypto news.com rank it as one of their top meme coins to buy now . The flocks always helping each other reach their goals! Teamwork makes the dream work! pic.twitter.com/Mk97zpMy37 — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) December 2, 2024 “Hidden” Meme Coin Flockers (FLOCK) – Here’s What You Need to Know Whilst Flockerz (FLOCK) has been flying under most meme coin investors’ radar, it is making waves in web3 trading circles.

From humble beginnings to worldwide notoriety the flock isn't ready to stop anytime soon! Here's to the next! pic.twitter.com/Go1L3mDsTm — Flockerz (@FlockerzToken) November 28, 2024 The current bullish environment in crypto means FLOCK is setting up to launch at the perfect time. Couple that with the fact that Flockerz offers so much more than your typical meme coin – FLOCK owners are automatically part of the Flockerz decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) called Flocktopia. Here they have a chance to earn more FLOCK every time they vote on DAO proposals, whilst presale investors are also benefitting from massive staking rewards, which were last around 575% per the official website. The blockbuster success of the presales means that major exchange listings are sure to come soon. Interested investors need to move quickly so as not to miss out on what could be one of the best meme coin token launches of 2024. Widely followed crypto analyst ClayBro outlines in the below video why hidden meme coin FLOCK could be one of the biggest success stories of 2025.

Is it innovative technology, solid real-world applications, or simply the promise of massive returns? With so many digital assets competing for attention, it’s crucial to focus on projects that not only offer solutions to real-world problems but also have the potential to generate life-changing returns. While Cronos and Bitcoin Cash have recently shown promising developments in scalability and market growth, Qubetics ($TICS) is stepping up with a unique feature that could redefine asset management entirely. Its Real-World Asset Tokenization bridges traditional and blockchain economies, offering a transformative opportunity for investors and businesses alike. Let’s break down how these three cryptos are shaping up to be some of the best investments for 2024. Qubetics ($TICS) Pioneers Real-World Asset Tokenization Qubetics is making waves as the world’s first Web3 aggregator, aiming to bridge the gap between traditional assets and blockchain technology. Its standout feature, Real-World Asset Tokenization , allows physical assets like real estate, art, and commodities to be represented digitally on the blockchain. This innovation provides liquidity to otherwise illiquid assets and opens up investment opportunities to a broader audience. Consider a small business owner with valuable equipment. Through Qubetics’ platform, they can tokenize this equipment, enabling them to secure loans using these tokens as collateral, thus accessing capital without traditional banking hurdles. For individual investors, this means the ability to invest in fractions of high-value assets like commercial real estate, diversifying their portfolios without substantial capital. Moreover, artists can tokenize their works, selling shares to multiple investors and receiving royalties automatically through smart contracts. This democratizes investment and ensures creators are fairly compensated. For a deeper understanding of Qubetics’ asset tokenization, check out this informative video . Qubetics Presale: A Golden Opportunity Currently, Qubetics is in its 11th presale stage, having sold over 255 million $TICS tokens to more than 5,600 holders, raising over $4.1 million. Tokens are priced at $0.0282 in this stage, with a 10% price increase slated for the next stage. Analysts predict that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a 783% return on investment. Investment Example: Investing $68,000 at the current price of $0.0282 per token could yield: At $0.25 (end of presale): $531,205 (783% ROI) At $1 (post-presale): $2,400,000 (3434% ROI) At $5: $12,000,000 (17,571% ROI) At $15 (after mainnet launch): $36,000,000 (52,912% ROI). These projections showcase the significant potential for life-changing returns, making Qubetics an attractive choice for early investors. Cronos Expands Its Ecosystem Cronos, the native token of the Crypto.com ecosystem, has been actively expanding its reach. Recently, Cronos Group Inc. reported a profit of $8.3 million in its third quarter, translating to earnings of 2 cents per share citeturn0search10. This financial growth reflects the company’s efforts to enhance its platform and services. In addition, Cronos has been focusing on increasing its user base by offering various incentives and launching new products. These initiatives aim to strengthen its position in the competitive crypto market. Bitcoin Cash Shows Signs of a Strong Rally Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has been experiencing significant price movements. The cryptocurrency recently rallied to near $500, gaining amid Bitcoin’s breakout performance citeturn0search1. Analysts suggest that if buying pressure continues and BCH surpasses the $500 hurdle, the next target could be $750. Furthermore, Bitcoin Cash has been breaking out of key technical patterns that suggest a 50% rally to $709 by December 2024 citeturn0search3. This bullish momentum is supported by Bitcoin’s halving events and pro-crypto policies. Conclusion: Seizing the Opportunity While Cronos and Bitcoin Cash are making strides in their respective areas, Qubetics ($TICS) offers a unique proposition with its real-world asset tokenization. The ongoing Qubetics presale presents a timely opportunity for investors to get in early and potentially reap substantial returns. Don’t miss out on this chance to be part of a project that’s set to revolutionize asset management in the crypto space.

This stash, seized from the infamous Silk Road marketplace, was part of the government’s long-running effort to liquidate confiscated crypto assets. The funds, initially moved to a fresh wallet with zero transaction history, were later deposited to Coinbase Prime, the go-to platform for institutional crypto trading. Speculation is rife that this signals an impending sale. Historically, such government sales have triggered selloffs in the market. But Bitcoin prices have remained relatively stable this time, dipping to just over 1.6% to around $95,580 as of press time. Silk Road, James Zhong, and the massive Bitcoin haul Back in 2022, the Department of Justice (DOJ) seized over 50,000 bitcoins tied to the Silk Road marketplace. James Zhong, who orchestrated the heist in 2012, was arrested and later pleaded guilty to wire fraud. The DOJ accused Zhong of exploiting vulnerabilities in Silk Road’s transaction system to siphon off the assets. The seizure, valued at $3.36 billion at the time, is one of the largest crypto recoveries ever. Court filings show that the government sold a portion of these assets in March 2023, offloading 9,861 bitcoins for $216 million. The DOJ had planned to liquidate the remaining holdings in four tranches over the year, but updates on further sales have been scarce. Last month, a Northern California district court authorized the government to liquidate these assets while resolving a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request tied to the case. The government’s collaboration with Coinbase Prime is another part of this saga. Earlier this year, the U.S. Marshals Service, a DOJ division, partnered with Coinbase Prime to manage and trade confiscated digital assets. This partnership has likely streamlined the liquidation process, as Coinbase Prime specializes in handling large-scale institutional transactions. MicroStrategy keeps stacking But as the U.S. government liquidates, MicroStrategy continues to aggressively accumulate. The Virginia-based company, led by Bitcoin maxi Michael Saylor, added 15,400 bitcoins to its holdings just moments before America’s transfer. It spent $1.5 billion between November 25 and December 1. This brings MicroStrategy’s total stash to a staggering $38 billion. An SEC filing reveals that MicroStrategy has spent $13.5 billion on Bitcoin purchases since November 11 alone. Saylor’s strategy of turning the company into a “Bitcoin Treasury” has paid off, with the firm’s stock soaring over 500% this year. Unlike the government, which seems eager to cash out, MicroStrategy is doubling down, cementing its position as a top corporate Bitcoin whale.

After months of strategic discussions, the acquisition, completed for an undisclosed amount, positions The Dai Lo to harness Fractal’s groundbreaking ZK technology and revitalize its vision for the future. The acquisition encompasses Fractal’s robust technology portfolio, token reserves, intellectual property, and, most importantly, its dedicated community. By integrating these assets, The Dai Lo aims to expand upon the exceptional work initiated by Fractal’s founders and deliver transformative solutions. Fractal should be part of every technology stack in DeFi, AI, and others on every chain possible. Privacy is a killer app and should be an option on every application on every chain. Fractal aims to be used everywhere” – Gary Mitchell. A Strategic Vision for Fractal Earlier this year, The Dai Lo embarked on a journey to explore groundbreaking projects in the Bitcoin, UTXO, BRC20, and Runes ecosystems. Fractal stood out as a project with immense potential but lacked the momentum to realize it fully. While Fractal demonstrated the capacity to operate as an independent Layer 1 (L1) or Layer 2 (L2) platform, its greatest value lies in serving as a foundational component for broader ecosystems, bridging blockchain and traditional Web2 applications. With privacy as a core focus, Fractal’s technology is uniquely positioned to redefine the market. “It’s our belief that this project could achieve a $1 billion market cap or more,” said Gary Mitchell, The Dai Lo’s unofficial leader. “Our mission is to realize that potential and build a future where privacy is prioritized and celebrated.” Meet The Dai Lo The Dai Lo is a team of transformation specialists committed to identifying undervalued projects and driving them to success. Gary Mitchell ( @GuyGaryMitchell ): A startup veteran passionate about innovation, Mitchell brings a wealth of experience from the Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana ecosystems and will dedicate his focus entirely to Fractal. Yeolin Han ( @_yeonglihan ): A coding prodigy with expertise in UTXO chains and the RGBPP space, Han’s technical acumen will be instrumental in unlocking Fractal’s full potential. And a team of about 10 developers with expertise in AI, ZK, and other related technologies. The Path Forward Revitalizing Fractal’s community is the team’s top priority. Acknowledging frustrations from past mismanagement, The Dai Lo is committed to rebuilding trust, improving transparency, and expanding the community with new supporters who align with the project’s vision. In tandem, the team is revisiting branding to return to Fractal’s roots as a privacy-focused project. With cutting-edge zero-knowledge technology in the pipeline, the long-term goal is to make Fractal scalable, reliable, and user-friendly. “Privacy isn’t just a feature—it’s the foundation,” said Yeolin Han. “Fractal will empower users to decide what remains public and what stays private, revolutionizing on-chain transaction privacy.” Additionally, “Fractal should be part of every technology stack in DeFi, AI, and others on every chain possible. Privacy is a killer app and should be an option on every application on every chain. Fractal aims to be used everywhere” said Gary Mitchell.

According to Cathie Wood of Ark Investment Management, Trump’s win will spur innovation in artificial intelligence, tech, and cryptocurrencies. In an interview with CNN’s Inside Politics Sunday, the Ark Investment CEO shared her thoughts about Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler’s restrictive policies on crypto, which, according to her, nearly knocked the country from the global cryptocurrency map. Wood said that the US lost its footing in digital currency, and Trump’s presidency will create meaningful developments in various sectors. US Must Focus On Top Technologies, Like Crypto And AI Cathie Wood states that overregulation is the country’s primary enemy of tech and innovation. She argues that Gensler’s aggressive regulation policy on crypto has caused many talents to leave the country. She adds that this is about to change, with the new administration approving friendly regulations on bitcoin and generative AI. Wood shared that five major technologies are shaping our world: cryptocurrency, energy storage, and multiomics. She explained that the US must develop and lead these technologies. In the same CNN interview, she shared that the concentration was on a few stocks in the last four years. However, with Trump returning to office, she expects more significant gains for companies pushing innovation. A Regulatory Reset Will Help US Tech & Crypto According to Cathie Wood, the SEC’s overregulation has particularly damaged cryptocurrency . Gensler’s approach and public statements have stifled innovation, according to Wood. And with the possibility of loose regulations on the horizon, Wood expects that smaller players in emerging industries can have their chances. Wood used the interview to highlight crypto’s experience under Gensler’s policies. She shared that the industry faced challenges, and the US needed to harness the technology before other countries left it out. However, a second Trump presidency will diminish the SEC’s influence. The administration is looking to expand the role of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to reverse the SEC’s overregulation. Public Should Expect Changes Under Trump’s Second Term Wood also discussed other possible economic issues and policies, including Trump’s tariff threats. These tariffs, while aggressive, she says, still make sense, especially if combined with tax cuts that will allow businesses to remain competitive. The combination of tariffs and tax cuts can help boost innovation in different sectors. The market responds positively to these plans, with many investors shifting their investments to smaller, high-growth companies. On the digital currency side, Bitcoin continues to lead the market, with price testing the $100k mark.

DOGE meets BTC: Earn Yields with New Staking Protocol Exciting news for Dogecoin (DOGE) enthusiasts! – GOAT Network, a Bitcoin layer 2 scaling project, will allow users to stake their DOGE to earn yields. Through this staking feature, investors can now earn passive income on this platform by utilizing their DOGE shares. The platform whose mainnet is yet to be released allows users to earn network rewards through staking by utilizing BTC. Within the ecosystem, bitcoin holders can engage in various decentralized finance activities such as lending or trading, and earn while maintaining the ownership of their assets. Now, the protocol aims to let Dogecoin (DOGE) users in on this opportunity, by allowing them to stake their coins to earn fixed yields in BTC. In the future, the platform aims to introduce more financial applications for meme coins to provide better rewards for DOGE holders. In a statement to Coindesk on Wednesday, GOAT Network announced this latest development. By adding DOGE into its ecosystem, the platform wants to be known as “the home of people’s coins.” As Dogecoin continues to evolve and expand from its meme coin origin, the DOGE community is growing stronger. DOGE is currently trading on the market at $0.4028. Despite enjoying a massive rally after the US presidential election and Elon Musk’s support, the Dogecoin price surge has seemed to slow down. In the 24-hour charts, Dogecoin price witnessed a drop of 0.50%. The coin’s 24-hour trading volume also took a 41.26% hit. Additionally, its market cap dropped by 0.49%. However, the weekly charts reflect an upward momentum with a 1.94% gain. Furthermore, in the monthly timeline, bulls have rallied DOGE upwards by 132.60%. Experts are speculating a pullback before the Dogecoin price breaks out to new heights. Amid this, investors are turning their eye towards IntelMarkets, a new AI altcoin projected to give bigger returns than DOGE.

The token’s impressive weekend rally has solidified a bullish trend, capturing significant attention from investors and analysts alike. Many speculate that this price pattern could trigger a massive rally reminiscent of XRP’s historic 5,600% surge in 2018. With heightened investor interest and positive sentiment driving the market, XRP stands out as a leading performer in the ongoing crypto resurgence. Analyst Predicts 5,600% XRP Price Rally Eyeing 2018 Crypto analyst tweeted about XRP price, highlighting a potential breakout similar to one in 2018. During that period, top altcoin surged an astonishing 5,600% after breaking out of a wedge pattern. While the analyst acknowledges that a repeat of such explosive growth is unlikely, the current chart displays a similar wedge structure, sparking optimism among traders. This technical setup, often associated with consolidation before significant moves, has drawn attention to XRP’s potential upside. Source- X Ripple Price Soars 38%: Is ATH Within Reach The latest price of XRP has seen a remarkable surge, climbing 18% over the past week and recording a 431% increase in monthly gains. This rally has pushed XRP ahead of Solana in market capitalization, solidifying its position as the third-largest cryptocurrency. Legal clarity and regulatory developments surrounding Ripple Labs have significantly boosted investor confidence. Ripple’s recent ecosystem innovations, including tokenized funds and the anticipated RLUSD stablecoin, further fuel the bullish momentum. In addition, Ripple’s new partnerships and strategic moves have strengthened its market position. The company continues to expand its use cases, integrating blockchain technology into financial systems and cross-border payments. As the crypto market responds to these developments, XRP’s price reached a high of $2.85 today, marking significant progress toward its all-time high of $3.84, achieved in January 2018. XRP’s price action has formed an ascending channel, demonstrating consistent upward movement. Key resistance levels are observed at $3.00 and the all-time high (ATH) near $3.85. If momentum sustains, XRP may aim to challenge these levels in the short term. The technical indicator for XRP price suggests bullish momentum as the cryptocurrency breaks through significant resistance levels. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached 94, signalling overbought conditions. However, this indicates strong buying pressure rather than an imminent reversal. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) stands at 0.31, reflecting positive capital inflow into XRP. XRP Price Chart: TradingView XRP’s bullish momentum, fueled by regulatory clarity, ecosystem expansion, and strong market interest, positions it for potential gains. While a 5,600% rally may be unlikely, sustained upward trends could propel XRP closer to its all-time high.

According to a new CNBC report, Coinbase’s Faryar Shirzad expects the US to begin enacting crypto regulations under Trump very quickly. At a recent Stand with Crypto event in the UK, Shirzard told CNBC that the Republican congress will easily approve pro-crypto measures. “We have the most pro-crypto Congress ever [in] history, we have an extraordinarily pro-crypto president coming into office. I think the combination should finally allow the 50 million Americans who own crypto to have their interests and voice heard in policy.” Congress is currently looking at two major pieces of crypto-related regulations, including the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act and the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act. According to Shirzad, the Republican congress is likely to pass botch acts rapidly. Crypto Political Action Committees (PACs) raised over $245 million for this year’s US Presidential election, reports CNBC. Last week, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said that Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler wanted to destroy the crypto industry. “Warren and Gensler tried to unlawfully kill our entire industry, and it was a major factor in the Democrats losing the election. The Democratic party should realize Warren is a liability and further distance themselves if they want to have any hope of rebuilding.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Polygon price prediction for 2024 expects the price of MATIC to surge toward $1.03. By 2030, we expect the MATIC price to record a maximum price of $10.51. Polygon, an Ethereum side chain and layer two scaling solution, has experienced substantial uptake by enterprises and industries in the last year. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, MATIC. This raises the question: Can MATIC price reach $10? This forecast for Polygon’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the MATIC price prediction from 2024 to 2030.

Currently, the bears are aiming for a drop below Fib channels. MATIC price analysis 1-day chart: Polygon aims for immediate decline MATIC witnessed a bearish rally after bulls failed to push the altcoin above immediate Fib levels. Over the last 24 hours, the price dropped toward $0.62. However, buyers are strongly defending a decline on the price chart. The 24-hour volume surged to $137 million, showing increased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.62, decreasing by over 0.3% in the last 24 hours. Matic/USD price chart.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the MATIC price from an immediate surge. However, if MATIC’s price successfully breaks above $0.6528, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.7007. POL/USDT Chart If bulls cannot initiate a surge, MATIC’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.5686, resulting in a correction to $0.5068. Is MATIC a good investment? MATIC token can be a good investment option in the long run as the project develops a roadmap for its Polygon 2.0 version. Polygon collaborates with diverse industries to enhance adoption, focusing on NFT solutions and Ethereum scalability. Partnerships include Starbucks for an NFT loyalty program and collaborations with Adidas, Prada, and Disney to develop NFT offerings. Why is Matic price down today? Following intense sell off around $0.64, MATIC price failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a break below immediate Fib channels. Will MATIC price touch $1? Yes, Matic price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2024. However, this depends on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will MATIC Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and MATIC gains regulatory recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2030. Is MATIC a good long-term investment? As Polygon continues to expand its offerings, it gains a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, MATIC can be a good long-term investment option. Recent news/ Opinions on MATIC According to Ali Charts, Polygon whales have accumulated more than 59 million POL tokens within the past 48 hours. This significant increase in activity from large holders suggests a growing confidence in the Polygon network. MATIC price prediction December 2024 Following Donald Trump’s victory in the elections, the crypto market witnessed a robust surge in prices. As a result, the altcoin market skyrocketed and touched a peak in market cap, resulting in a bull run in the Polygon price. However, analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices following a bearish October. We expect MATIC to record a minimum price of $0.57 and a maximum price of $0.72, with an average of $0.6 in December. MATIC Price Prediction Potential low Potential average Potential high MATIC Price Prediction December 2024 $0.57 $0.6 $0.72 MATIC price prediction 2024 Based on our thorough technical analysis of MATIC’s historical price data, we anticipate Polygon’s price in 2024’s end to range between a minimum of $0.57 and a maximum of $0.72, with an average trading price around $0.6.

That’s why Polygon became popular during the last bull market. But this time, in 2025, Polygon has tougher competition from Arbitrum, Optimism, and Starknet. However, Polygon’s Proof of Stake (PoS) chain can handle up to 65,000 transactions per second (TPS) and is cheaper than chains like Arbitrum and Optimism. Hence, increasing adoption might drive up its price in 2025. In 2025, the price of Polygon is forecasted to reach a minimum level of $1.34. It’s anticipated to achieve a maximum level of $1.57, with an average price of $1.39 throughout the year. MATIC price forecast for 2026 Polygon has made PolygonzkEVM available to everyone, making it one of the first ZK Rollups to do so. This is a big step forward for Polygon and gives it an advantage. With its growing use by businesses, innovative technology, and past success, Polygon could reach a new all-time high in 2026. According to the forecast and technical analysis, Polygon’s price is expected to hit a minimum of $2.07 in 2026. The maximum price projection is $2.39, with an average value of $2.12. Polygon (MATIC) price prediction 2027 In 2027, one Polygon is anticipated to reach a minimum price of $3.03. The maximum projection for MATIC price is $3.60, with an average price of $3.11 for the year. Polygon price prediction 2028 For 2028, the price of Polygon is predicted to attain a minimum value of $4.28. The maximum value could soar to $5.36, with an average trading price of $4.43 throughout the year. Polygon price prediction 2029 In 2029, Polygon’s price is forecasted to bottom out at $6.08. The maximum possible level for MATIC price could hit $7.41, with an average forecast price of $6.26. Polygon (MATIC) price prediction 2030 Looking ahead to 2030, Polygon’s price is expected to reach a minimum of $8.93. The maximum projection is $10.51, with an average trading price of $9.18.

We anticipate Polygon’s price in 2024 to range between a minimum of $0.9012 and a maximum of $1.03, with an average trading price of around $0.9298. However, its future market sentiment entirely depends on the SEC’s stance, global regulation, and investor interest. MATIC historic price sentiment MATIC price history MATIC debuted in 2019, initially valued below a cent. Maintained a steady level around $0.02 for the following two years. The transformation of MATIC into Polygon in 2021 led to significant growth. Surged past the $1 mark in May 2021, eventually peaking over $2. Notably, on December 27, 2021, Polygon reached an all-time high of $2.92. However, in 2022, the token struggled, dipping below $1 in May. It experienced several market crashes throughout the year, falling below $0.50 in June. There was a brief resurgence above $1 in August. By the end of 2022, Polygon closed at $0.7585, reflecting a significant 70% decline. The following year, 2023, saw mixed performance for Polygon. It broke the $1 threshold in February but faced setbacks, such as dropping to $0.5593 in June due to Crypto.com news. Nonetheless, it peaked at $0.8775 on July 13. The token then experienced a decline to $0.4946 on September 11. Recovering momentum, it reached $0.9789 on November 14. As of January 16, 2024, Polygon was trading at approximately $0.8514.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 19:44:00

In a space dominated by dog-themed coins, new players like BTFD Coin, Apu Apustaja, and Cat in a Dog’s World are shaking things up in ways no one saw coming. Each of these projects brings something fresh to the table, with strong community backing and exciting growth prospects. BTFD Coin is breaking barriers with its record-breaking presale, offering a mix of high APY staking and a unique P2E game concept . Meanwhile, Apu Apustaja, inspired by its viral meme roots, is rallying a community of thousands and gaining traction among first-time crypto investors. Not to be outdone, Cat in a Dog’s World is proving that felines have a place in the meme coin universe, riding high on a Solana integration. With so many choices, it’s worth digging deeper into what makes these meme coins stand out. Whether you’re chasing the next big thing or just looking for the best meme coins to invest in this weekend, here’s the rundown on why BTFD Coin, Apu Apustaja, and Cat in a Dog’s World are stealing the spotlight. Why Everyone Is Talking About BTFD Coin and Its Mind-Boggling Presale Success BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a powerhouse in the making. Since its presale began on November 26, 2024, BTFD Coin has been generating buzz for all the right reasons. Launching at an initial price of $0.000004 per coin, it has advanced swiftly through its presale stages. Within the first 24 hours, the project raised over $150,000, marking a significant milestone early in its journey. By the end of the first week, it reached the 6th stage, with the price increasing to $0.000058. So far, the presale has raised over $600,000, attracted more than 1,500 enthusiastic holders, and sold an impressive 16 billion $BTFD coins . But BTFD Coin isn’t relying on hype alone. Its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, “Raging Bull,” promises to bring fun and utility when it launches in Stage 8, allowing players to earn rewards while gaming. Staking enthusiasts are already cashing in on the 90% APY program introduced in Stage 4, which offers unmatched returns for those willing to lock their tokens. To sweeten the deal, the project’s referral program gives both the referrer and referee a 10% bonus in BTFD tokens for purchases over $50. Now, let’s talk numbers. Imagine putting down $5,600 in Stage 6 when the price was $0.000058 per coin. That would’ve landed you approximately 96,551,724 BTFD tokens. By the time the presale wraps up and the price hits $0.0006, your investment would be worth a staggering $57,931. That’s a tenfold return—proof that early adopters could see life-changing gains. With so many features already in motion and a growing community of “bulls,” BTFD Coin is fast becoming one of the best meme coins to invest in this weekend. Apu Apustaja: From Internet Meme to Crypto Contender Apu Apustaja, the endearing internet meme, has made a significant leap into the cryptocurrency space with its token, APU. As of December 2, 2024, APU is trading at approximately $0.000832, with a market capitalization of around $266.6 million and a circulating supply of 320,385,865,167 APU coins. The token has experienced a 12.77% decrease from its previous close, with an intraday high of $0.000998 and a low of $0.000827.

The Democratic Party of Korea (DPK) previously pushed back against the ruling People Power Party’s (PPP) proposal to postpone crypto asset taxation, which was supposed to take effect in 2021 but has already been put on hold twice. The DPK initially suggested increasing the tax threshold from 2.5 million won, or $1,784, to 50 million won ($35,688) instead of delaying the taxation of crypto gains, but the opposition is now changing its stance. The Korea Herald reports that during a press conference on Sunday, DPK floor leader, Representative Park Chan-dae, said his party no longer opposes the proposal to postpone the implementation of the crypto tax. “We have decided to agree to a two-year moratorium on the implementation of the cryptocurrency taxation proposed by the government and ruling party.” In July of this year, 13 representatives submitted a proposal to delay crypto taxation by three years, citing an anemic market at the time. “However, with investment sentiment toward virtual assets deteriorating, some argue that hasty taxation of virtual assets is not desirable right now, as virtual assets are high-risk assets with a higher risk of loss than stocks, and if income tax is also imposed, most investors are expected to leave the market. Accordingly, the tax enforcement date for virtual asset income, currently scheduled to be taxed from January 1, 2025, will be postponed for three years to January 1, 2028 (Article 37, Paragraph 5 of the Bill).” But with recent developments, South Korea may start taxing crypto income as early as 2027.

The digital investment product has recently recorded a monthly trading volume of $154 million, valued at 1.2 billion HKD in November 2024. This milestone reflects the increasing interest and confidence in Bitcoin-related investment products. It is particularly significant for a region that has only recently embraced cryptocurrency ETFs. Key Players Driving the Bitcoin ETF Surge in Hong Kong Many investors are riding on Hong Kong’s defined push for varied crypto derivatives offerings to go all out on Bitcoin ETFs. Three Bitcoin spot ETFs are leading the charge in this historic surge. This includes the ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF, Bosera Hashkey Bitcoin ETF, and Harvest Bitcoin Spot ETF. Together, these ETFs account for most of the trading volume. In particular, ChinaAMC, launched under the Huaxia Fund umbrella, has been the dominant player. This digital product is responsible for a significant portion of the monthly trading volume. As of December 2, ChinaAMC Bitcoin ETF had recorded an impressive trading volume of 2.02 million shares, each priced at 11.89 HKD. This positions ChinaAMC as the clear leader among the three ETFs. Meanwhile, Harvest Bitcoin Spot ETF is the second-largest contributor, with 162,500 shares traded on December 2 at 11.96 HKD per share. Bosera Hashkey Bitcoin ETF, while contributing to the overall volume, saw a trading volume of 64,680 shares, with its shares priced at HKD 74.58. ChinaAMC and Harvest International alone accounted for about 88% of the total trading volume in November, around 1.06 billion HKD, equivalent to $136 million. These ETFs have been at the forefront of the market’s growth, capturing the lion’s share of investor interest. Hong Kong ETF Market: A Growing Market with Room to Expand Despite the impressive numbers, Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs are still far from reaching the scale of their U.S. counterparts. This includes the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF. These digital investment products boast average daily trading volumes of 40 million shares and 3.8 million shares, respectively. These volumes significantly surpass those seen in Hong Kong, showing the stark contrast in market size and investor activity levels. However, Hong Kong’s growth trajectory indicates its BTC ETFs are set for expansion, with rising investor interest likely boosting volumes soon. Hong Kong’s Strategic Positioning in the Crypto World Since their launch, Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong have steadily gained momentum , reflecting the region’s growing appeal as a cryptocurrency hub. The primary goal behind approving these funds was to offer local and international investors a secure and transparent platform for trading digital assets. November’s record-breaking trading volumes underscore this success, signaling strong investor enthusiasm for the digital asset market. Now firmly established in the global crypto landscape, Hong Kong is poised to attract increasing attention from cryptocurrency investors worldwide.

According to the SEC filing document , the WisdomTree XRP fund will be listed on the Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. The Bank of New York Mellon serves as the administrator, fund accountant, and transfer agent for WisdomTree XRP ETF . “The Trust’s investment objective is to gain exposure to the price of XRP, less expenses and liabilities of the Trust’s operations. In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Trust will hold XRP and will value its Shares daily,” WisdomTree wrote within its S-1 filing. Though WisdomTree has not unveiled a ticker symbol for the XRP ETF, the firm explained through the filing that the shares will be sold or redeemed in blocks of 5,000 shares based on the quantity of XRP attributable to each share. You might also like: WisdomTree files for XRP ETF in Delaware The WisdomTree ETF would track the XRP ( XRP ) price, which is currently the third-largest crypto asset by market value, just below Bitcoin and Ethereum. WisdomTree’s filing comes a week after the firm established a trust entity in Delaware for the proposed fund. At that time, no formal application had been submitted to the SEC . In order to bring a new ETF class into the market, WisdomTree must submit a 19b-4 Form. The firm would need the SEC’s approval for both the S-1 and 19b-4 Forms before the XRP ETF can list and trade on national exchanges. Though, that remains to be seen as XRP’s developer firm Ripple Labs is still engaged in an ongoing legal battle with the SEC that has been building up since 2020. WisdomTree is not the first firm to attempt to introduce more crypto ETF offerings beyond Bitcoin( BTC ) and Ethereum( ETH ). Bitwise has gone further in its effort to bring XRP ETF’s into the market after filing an S-1 Form on Nov. 26. In early November, 21Shares also did the same for an XRP-based fund amid skepticism toward crypto ETF demand outside Bitcoin products. Meanwhile, Canary Capital has also sought approval for ETFs based on assets like Solana( SOL ), Litecoin, and HBAR.

According to some crypto commentators over Twitter/X, Bitcoin’s market dominance is dipping, which means that altcoin season is about to start. In a post by MikyBull Crypto, Bitcoin’s market dominance falls below its two-year support line, creating plenty of opportunities for holders and traders. According to TradingView, Bitcoin’s current dominance is 56.67%, from last week’s 57%, breaking through its support level for two years. Analysts say that the continuous dip in Bitcoin’s dominance will impact the general crypto market this December and onwards. On-chain and market data suggest that altcoins are poised for a market run, with MikyBull Crypto saying that its season started November 30th. Wow, Bitcoin dominance has just broken down the 2-year support. We are indeed officially in #ALTSEASON folks! https://t.co/IYfQF7P7XI pic.twitter.com/fVysBYuOKn — Mikybull Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) November 30, 2024 A Look At Bitcoin Market Dominance In crypto, analysts and market participants use a variety of metrics to assess Bitcoin’s performance. Bitcoin dominance is one reliable metric used to determine the relative market share of the asset in the crypto sector. The higher the percentage share of BTC, the better it is for holders and investors. However, Bitcoin’s dominance score has been dipping in recent weeks. As of December 2nd, it is at 55.3%, compared to 58.9% last month. According to MikyBull Crypto, Bitcoin has dipped below its two-year support. A declining Bitcoin dominance offers insights into the traders’ and investors’ strategies. One takeaway is that investors are reallocating their cash to other digital assets. Many analysts say that some of these investors are reallocating funds to altcoins, like XRP , which is now surging. Analysts say investors are potentially diversifying their funds and looking at other high-growth coin alternatives. Analysts And Crypto Commentators Offer Differing Insights A few altcoins are currently leading the market surge. Ether is experiencing a spike in price and increased demand for leveraged ETH exchange-traded funds. On-chain data shows the product experienced a 160% increase in demand immediately after the November 5th US elections. Analysts remain bullish on ETH, and many expect the asset to hit $4k soon. Then, there’s XRP, which trades above the $2 level. Pav Hundal of Swyftx offers a conservative opinion, saying that Bitcoin’s dominance score may still hit 65%, 67%, or even 70% before it declines. He argues that complex factors make it impossible to pick the right date for altcoin’s surge or Bitcoin’s decline. Not All Analysts See An Altcoin Surge Soon Meanwhile, not all crypto commentators agree that altcoins’ surge will come in days. Ki Young Ju of CryptoQuant advises caution on times like this. The CryptoQuant CEO remains bullish on Bitcoin, adding that there’s still institutional support for Bitcoin, and it’s unlikely that they will refocus on speculative assets. The CEO added that for altcoins to reach all-time high market caps, these assets need a considerable capital inflow to cryptocurrency exchanges. He said that altcoins must develop strategies to earn capital instead of relying on Bitcoin’s lack of momentum.

The move, first detailed in the exchange’s developer documentation, aims to reduce issues typically associated with funding self-custody wallets. Coinbase Onramp offers a one-click purchasing feature that minimizes the steps required to convert fiat currency into cryptocurrency. “Using crypto often involves too many hassles, and users give up as a result,” Coinbase said. The new integration is part of an effort to simplify the process and retain users. Formerly known as Coinbase Pay, the Onramp tool is a software development kit (SDK) and a suite of APIs that developers can embed in their apps and browser extensions. It supports a wide range of wallets, including Ethereum’s MetaMask and Rainbow, Solana’s Phantom, and Coinbase’s own Coinbase Wallet.

The platform seems to be grappling with the fallout from a decision to temporarily pause its livestream function after users broadcast disturbing content in a bid to pump their tokens’ values. Weekly Income Nosedives Information from decentralized finance (DeFi) data aggregator DefiLlama shows that between November 18 and November 24, Pump.fun generated an impressive $33.83 million in revenue, the highest since its launch in early 2024. The figure represented a 60% increase from the prior week and a 400% jump since the beginning of November, as meme coin mania hit the broader crypto market. However, the following week saw a dramatic $22.52 million reversal, with proceeds plunging to $11.31 million, the lowest the platform recorded since the end of October. Despite the dip, the $82.78 million raised in November, per DefiLlama, is still the highest amount Pump.fun has raked in across a 30-day period since it opened to the public. Monthly returns have been on a steady rise since March, with only a slight contraction in September, when they went down to $14.41 million, being the only blip. In that time, the meme coin launcher has earned more than $227 million in revenue. The weekly income slump was also accompanied by a significant dip in the number of tokens launched on Pump.fun during that period. On November 30, according to data from Dune, only 34,359 were created, a 50% drop from a record 69,046 registered just ten days earlier on November 20. Exploitative Livestreams The decline came against the backdrop of Pump.fun’s decision to suspend its livestream feature amid rising concerns over harmful behavior. Originally intended to help developers promote their projects, some seemingly abused the feature by airing acts ranging from threats of self-harm to extreme violence. One incident involved a developer claiming they would commit suicide if their token failed to hit a specific market cap. At the same time, another allegedly threatened to harm a pet in exchange for their project’s success. In another incident, a user had to be hospitalized for several days after sustaining severe burns when he doused himself in isopropyl and set off fireworks during a live broadcast to promote the TruthOrDare (DARE) meme coin. However, following public outcry, the Pump.fun team issued a community note on November 24, acknowledging the disturbing nature of the events. They also announced that they would indefinitely pause the platform’s livestream feature, promising to work on its moderation tools to prevent such content from being broadcast in the future.
