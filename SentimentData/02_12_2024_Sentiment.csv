In a new interview on the Altcoin Daily YouTube channel, Mark Yusko names his top token picks, including prominent smart contract platforms Solana ( SOL ) and Cardano ( ADA ). Other digital assets on the executive’s list include XRP , the digital asset associated with Ripple Labs, meme asset Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and layer-1 blockchain Hedera ( HBAR ). “I’ve become pretty partial to Solana, I got to say it. I mean, the guys have done a good job convincing me and you know, thankfully we didn’t sell our last bag and it’s gone from $13 to $240 or whatever so it’s pretty good.” Yusko goes on to say that if he had “money to lose,” he’d bet on ADA, XRP, and HBAR as some firms in the traditional finance (TradFi) world may eventually adopt the crypto assets to not get left behind. “If I had money that I was willing to lose – because I think you could literally lose it – I might actually own a little bit of [ADA, HBAR, and XRP] because… Depending on how this ‘czar’ position and all that stuff plays out, could I see a world in which, as a bridge to the future – meaning the incumbents don’t want to be displaced tomorrow – they say ‘You know what? Fine we’ll use XRP or we’ll use some Hedera thing and we’ll be crypto.'” Concluding with DOGE, Yusko says not owning the top meme token is a bet against billionaire Elon Musk. “Don’t bet against Elon, obviously. DOGE probably is not the dumbest thing in the world. I thought it was pretty dumb all the way from $0 to $60 billion so jokes on me, I’m the dumb one, but anyway, that’s probably it.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

With its impressive performance, it seems likely that the bulls will carry this rally until it reaches the $3 mark. Will the XRP Price Rally Continue? Following XRP’s latest achievement, participation from whales and investors has skyrocketed and is raising one common question – Will this rally continue, or is there a chance of a price correction in the coming days? $256M of XRP Inflow, Sell-off Incoming? The on-chain analytics firm Coinglass recently reported that amid the ongoing bull rally, whales and institutions have been consistently dumping millions of dollars worth of XRP onto exchanges. According to Coinglass’s XRP spot inflow/outflow data, exchanges have witnessed a significant inflow of $256.30 million in the past three days. Source: Coinglass This substantial inflow suggests that whales and institutions have transferred their holdings to exchanges. In the cryptocurrency landscape, such inflows typically indicate a potential sell-off and an impending price decline. Traders Strong Bests on Long Side In addition to whale participation, traders appear more optimistic, strongly betting on long positions, as indicated by Coinglass. At press time, the XRP Long/Short ratio on the four-hour timeframe stands at 1.98, indicating a strong bullish sentiment among traders. Currently, 66.5% of top traders across exchanges hold long positions, while 33.5% hold short positions. This data indicates that, in the short term, bulls are dominating the altcoin, which could support XRP in continuing its rally toward $3. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level An analysis of these on-chain metrics suggests that bulls are currently in control, potentially supporting XRP’s price and ongoing rally. However, the activity of whales and institutions, along with the $256.30 million worth of XRP offloaded, signals a potential price correction in the coming days. XRP Price Prediction According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, XRP has broken through the highly anticipated resistance level of $2. Following this breakout, there is a strong possibility that it could soar to $3.15 in the coming days. However, the price could experience a minor correction or a breakout retest before the rally continues toward the $3 mark. Source: Trading View Currently, XRP is trading near $2.17 and has registered a price gain of over 15% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume decreased by 14%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-01 21:01:57

Five digital coins are poised for potential explosive growth, offering the chance for remarkable returns. This article delves into these promising assets that could deliver astonishing gains by Christmas. CYBRO Presale Soars Past $5.5 Million: A One-in-a-Million NeoBank Investment Opportunity CYBRO is capturing the attention of crypto whales as its exclusive token presale quickly surges above $5.5 million. This cutting-edge NeoBank offers investors unparalleled opportunities to enhance crypto earnings across multiple blockchains. The presale has now reached its 8th stage out of 10, marking the final opportunity to acquire CYBRO tokens at the presale price of just $0.045 each. With only two stages remaining, time is running out to invest before the Token Generation Event (TGE), where prices are expected to skyrocket. Experts are forecasting a potential ROI of 1200%, solidifying CYBRO’s status as a transformative opportunity in the DeFi and NeoBank sectors. In addition to tokens, CYBRO introduces special Points, offering even more opportunities for investors. Holders of these Points will automatically participate in the CYBRO Airdrop, where the more Points you hold, the more tokens you will receive. CYBRO distributes up to 1 million Points weekly, which can be earned by investing in DeFi Vaults in the CYBRO app. Holders of CYBRO tokens will enjoy lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, cashback on purchases, reduced trading and lending fees, and a robust insurance program within the platform. With only 21% of the total tokens available for this presale and approximately 80 million already sold, this is a golden opportunity for savvy investors to secure a stake in a project that's truly one in a million. >>>Join CYBRO and aim for future returns up to 1200% Solana's Scalable Blockchain: Discovering SOL's Role in Dapps Development Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It provides a base for decentralized applications, known as dapps. Competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana aims for faster transactions through its unique architecture. It supports development in multiple programming languages, making it flexible for developers. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana. It is essential to the ecosystem. SOL is used for transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding those who support the network. The coin holds value as it powers the Solana ecosystem and gives users access to various projects. Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Instead, it attracts developers and investors with its high-capacity network. Avalanche (AVAX): A Layer-1 Blockchain Offering Speed and Customization Avalanche (AVAX) is a Layer-1 blockchain platform that provides eco-friendly operations, low transaction fees, and high-speed processing with a capacity of 4,500 transactions per second. It enables users to launch customizable Subnets for tailored blockchain deployments. Avalanche employs a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto consensus principles, achieving transaction finality in less than two seconds. The platform consists of three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—that manage various functions like transactions and smart contract executions. AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by covering transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and facilitating the operation of multiple Subnets, supporting payments, staking, and the creation of custom tokens and blockchains. Polkadot's DOT: Enhancing Blockchain Connectivity and Scalability Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. It allows value and data to be shared without intermediaries. By using parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing transactions much faster than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Polkadot token (DOT) is used for governance and staking within its network, allowing holders to participate in the protocol's development and transaction verification. Developed by Ethereum co-creator Gavin Wood and maintained by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot aims to create more interconnected and efficient blockchains. Introducing POL: Powering the Polygon Ecosystem The Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL) is a utility token at the core of the Polygon network. It facilitates a range of operations and services across the ecosystem. Holders can stake their tokens, participating in network security and consensus, and earn additional tokens based on the amount staked. POL also enables governance, giving holders the right to vote on proposals that influence the development and direction of the network. Additionally, it grants access to exclusive services within the ecosystem, unlocking special features and applications. With its wide array of use cases, POL plays a crucial role in the growth and functionality of the Polygon ecosystem. Conclusion In conclusion, while SOL, AVAX, DOT, and POL show potential, their short-term prospects seem limited. In contrast, CYBRO stands out as an advanced DeFi platform offering investors exceptional opportunities to boost earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With features like generous staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO provides a superior user experience with smooth deposits and withdrawals. Focusing on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO has attracted significant interest from major crypto investors and influencers, marking it as a promising project in the current bull run.

Will Trump’s deregulation do it again?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/lack-of-oversight-crashed-crypto-once-will-trumps-deregulation-do-it-again/,"The last crypto crash didn’t happen because there were too many rules. It happened because there were barely any. Back in 2022, crypto giants treated the market like a game board. Risky bets, shady leverage, and zero accountability made them billions until it all fell apart. Companies like Terraform, FTX, and Celsius went down in flames, leaving ordinary investors broke. Fast forward to today. Trump’s win has the crypto industry popping champagne. Bitcoin prices have surged nearly 40%, brushing against $100,000. The market cap has jumped by over $1 trillion. The president, once a critic of crypto, is now its loudest cheerleader. He’s promised to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” But with promises of deregulation and industry-friendly policies, skeptics can’t help but wonder if Trump’s crypto revolution is setting the stage for another collapse. The push for less regulation The industry spent over $100 million on the election—almost half of all corporate political spending. It seems to be paying off. Reports say Trump is letting crypto insiders pick the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Gary Gensler, the current SEC chair and a proud crypto hater, plans to step down before Trump takes office. The president had said publicly he’d fire Gensler on day one. Elon Musk, Trump’s ally and crypto enthusiast, has joined the fight for deregulation. He took to his X platform (formerly Twitter) to call for the “deletion” of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency designed to protect consumers from financial scams. According to Elon, the U.S. has “too many duplicative regulatory agencies.” His comment got cheers from crypto fans who see government oversight as the enemy of innovation. Of course, the billionaire’s influence in the crypto industry doesn’t stop with tweets. Dogecoin, the meme coin he’s championed, has skyrocketed 150% since Trump’s election victory. Why? Because “DOGE” is now shorthand for the “Department of Government Efficiency,” Elon’s new agency. Trump’s personal ties to crypto Trump’s sons are involved in World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture that stands to benefit from favorable regulations. Critics say this creates a conflict of interest. Trump’s policies could directly enrich his family while manipulating the market. And it’s not just his family. Crypto titans are backing Trump with both money and influence. The $100 million they funneled into the election wasn’t charity. They want a return on their investment, starting with lenient rules and friendlier regulators. If Trump delivers, it could turn the U.S. into a haven for crypto innovation—or a playground for unchecked greed. The stakes are higher now than in 2021. Back then, crypto was largely isolated from traditional finance. Its crashes didn’t get far beyond the market. That’s not the case anymore. The SEC’s recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has tethered crypto to the global financial system. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has already attracted $48 billion, drawing in hedge funds, retirement accounts, and institutional investors. This integration makes the market more vulnerable. A crypto collapse today would likely affect banks, pensions, and the global economy itself.",OP-ED|BTC|USA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-01 21:20:34

The crypto landscape is ever-evolving, and meme coins have carved out an intriguing niche. They’re not just about fun and games; they represent a unique blend of community spirit and investment potential. In this article, we’ll dive into some exciting new players, including BTFD Coin, Cat in a Dog’s World, and Act I: The AI Prophecy, and explore what makes them stand out in this crowded space. One of the most thrilling newcomers on the block is BTFD Coin, which has already made waves with its presale success. In just 24 hours, it raised over $200,000, and now, in the 5th stage of its presale, it has surpassed $420,000, selling more than 10 billion coins to over 1000 holders. The enthusiasm around BTFD Coin is palpable, and it’s clear that this project is poised for greatness. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, it’s designed to engage a wide audience and encourage community involvement through various incentives like staking rewards and gaming features. In contrast, we’ll also look at established players like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, which have solidified their positions as top contenders in the meme coin arena. These projects have been around for a while, yet they continue to attract attention and investment, serving as alternative assets in a volatile market. Understanding their journey can provide valuable insights into what makes a meme coin successful and how new entries like BTFD Coin can learn from their strategies. BTFD Coin: The Next-Gen Meme Coin Supremo BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin; it’s a phenomenon that’s capturing the hearts and wallets of investors. With its presale hitting the ground running, BTFD Coin has sold over 10 billion coins, attracting over 1000 holders, raising more than $420,000 in the process. But what truly sets it apart? For starters, the presale is currently in its 5th stage, with the 6th stage set to unlock once 15 billion coins are sold. The current price of $0.00005 is a bargain compared to the projected presale end price of $0.0006, suggesting a 14900% ROI for early investors. What’s more, BTFD Coin has a unique Play2Earn game that encourages user engagement and offers real rewards. Imagine playing a fun game while earning coins—sounds like a win-win, right? This gamification aspect appeals particularly to younger audiences, who are increasingly drawn to interactive investment opportunities. The staking rewards further enhance its attractiveness, allowing holders to earn passive income simply by holding their coins. Community engagement is at the heart of BTFD Coin’s strategy. For instance, the project allocates 17% of its maximum supply to Rage Bull Gaming Rewards, which not only incentivises participation but also helps in building a robust community around the coin. This creates a sense of belonging, turning casual investors into dedicated supporters Cat in a Dog’s World: A New Contender Next up, we have Cat in a Dog’s World, a fresh face in the meme coin scene that’s generating buzz for its innovative approach. This project is all about breaking the norms and offering something different. It taps into the playful rivalry between cats and dogs, creating a narrative that resonates with pet lovers and meme enthusiasts alike. What sets Cat in a Dog’s World apart is its community-driven ethos. It encourages holders to participate in various activities, from social media campaigns to local meet-ups, fostering a sense of camaraderie among its users. This approach not only builds a loyal following but also increases visibility in the crowded crypto market. Moreover, Cat in a Dog’s World has implemented features that allow holders to earn rewards through participation in community events and initiatives. This engagement helps to create a vibrant ecosystem where users feel valued and involved. Imagine being part of a community where your love for pets translates into tangible rewards—it’s an enticing proposition for many. As we look at the broader market, it’s clear that Cat in a Dog’s World is vying for a spot alongside the heavyweights. Its unique branding and community focus may just be the ticket to establishing itself as one of the best new meme coins to buy in December 2024. Act I: The AI Prophecy: Blending Technology with Meme Culture Lastly, let’s dive into Act I: The AI Prophecy. This project uniquely combines cutting-edge AI technology with the playful energy of meme culture. It’s an ambitious undertaking that seeks to harness the power of artificial intelligence to enhance user experience and engagement within the crypto space. Act I offers a distinctive proposition: it uses AI algorithms to analyse market trends and user behaviour, providing invaluable insights to its community. This not only empowers investors but also helps them make informed decisions as they navigate the often unpredictable crypto landscape. The integration of AI into the meme coin realm is not just innovative; it’s a game-changer. The project also emphasises community engagement, similar to what we see with BTFD Coin and Cat in a Dog’s World. Holders are encouraged to participate in governance, influencing the direction of the project and its features. This democratic approach fosters loyalty and makes users feel like active contributors rather than passive investors. As for investment potential, the early buzz around Act I: The AI Prophecy indicates it could be one of the best new meme coins to buy in December 2024. Its unique selling points and the integration of AI technology position it as a strong contender in the meme coin market. Join the Next Meme Coin Bull Run with BTFD Coin!

The areas with the highest levels of crypto exposure in 2021 also experienced significant increases in both mortgage and auto loan origination and balance figures in the following years. Crypto Gains and Larger Mortgages The report revealed that for low-income households in areas with high crypto exposure, the mortgage rate jumped from 4.1% in January 2020 to 15.4% in January 2024, almost four times higher. The average mortgage balance increased by over 150%, from almost $172K to a little over $443K, indicating that profits from crypto sales may have helped with larger down payments. Low-income households in high-crypto areas earn an average of $40,664, which results in a mortgage debt-to-income ratio of 0.53, well above the recommended 0.36 and the 0.43 required for some standard loans. The report suggests that this high ratio is concerning because it’s linked to a greater risk of default, particularly during financial crises. On the other hand, in low-crypto areas, low-income households have a much lower debt-to-income ratio of 0.19, with an average mortgage balance of $136,481 and income of $35,950. This suggests that the rise in mortgage debt in recent years may be mainly happening in high-crypto areas, which might increase financial instability. From 2020 to 2024, mortgage delinquency rates dropped across the board, particularly among low-income households. The decline in delinquency was similar across areas with high and low crypto exposure. For example, delinquency fell by 4.2% in high-crypto areas and 3.8% in low-crypto areas for low-income groups. High-crypto areas had lower delinquency rates in 2020, so the percentage drop was bigger there. For high-income households, delinquency rates showed little change. As of Q1 2024, delinquency rates are at their lowest in 15 years, around 1.7%, with no signs of “distress” in high-crypto areas. Auto Loan Debt Hits $1.6T, Crypto Areas See Largest Increases Auto loan debt has surged to over $1.6 trillion as of early 2024, with notable increases among low-income households, particularly in high-crypto exposure areas. Between 2020 and 2024, average auto loan balances for low-income households grew by 52% in high-crypto areas compared to a 38% rise in low-crypto areas. This could potentially suggest that crypto earnings or windfalls may have enabled more vehicle purchases. On the other hand, middle- and high-income households saw decreases in their average auto loan balances during the same period, though those in high-crypto areas experienced smaller declines or even slight increases.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 22:05:00

Analyst Thinks It’s Happening This Cycle,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-to-hit-10-analyst-thinks-its-happening-this-cycle/,"As Bitcoin leads the charge for crypto this cycle, with its price teasing the $100k level, many analysts offer predictions on top altcoins. One token that’s widely seen to surge in this cycle is Cardano (ADA), a popular proof-of-stake blockchain that supports dApps. If one crypto analyst is to be believed, Cardano can hit $10 in this current bull cycle. According to Lark Davis, the token’s 213% monthly surge only scratches the surface of its full potential. Cardano has been one of the top-performing digital assets in the last few weeks. With its over 200% gain in one month, Cardano’s market cap is nearing that of USDC. And for Davis, he expects that this “Ethereum killer” will reach an all-time high of $10 this cycle. Can Cardano Surge To $10? If Davis’ predictions hold, Cardano’s price will grow by 800%. The popular crypto commentator suggests that it’s never too late to invest in the asset. Davis’ assertion is based on observations that Cardano still has room for growth. BREAKING: Lark Davis says “ #Cardano ‘s getting the attention and the hype, we could see $10.00 $ADA .” pic.twitter.com/oOpCx0DuI6 — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) November 29, 2024 Davis explains that strong macroeconomic indicators back Cardano, and there’s still hype on its use cases and ecosystem. He mentioned that the attention and favorable market conditions would let the token “run real hard and real fast”. Davis expects Cardano to continue its run in the short term, and its price will hit $3.16. From this price point, the token can increase by 332%, at the back of a 1.618 Fibonacci level, with a price of $4.80. He expects more price action for Cardano, and when the Fibonacci level reaches 2.618, the token’s price can hit $7.70. Finally, Davis sees Caradno making another push to $10 behind a Fibonacci level score of 3.618. Cardano’s Market Dominance According to Davis, Cardano had 4% market dominance in the last cycle. He analyzed that the token’s market cap can increase 10x in the current market valuation, pushing its valuation to roughly $370 billion. This 10-fold increase in market valuation will be reflected in its price, pushing Cardano past the $10 level. In short, the prediction of its Fibonacci price level matches the analyst’s expectations of its market cap. Other market analysts also echo Davis’ price assessment for Cardano. For example. Dan Gambardello shared that the token can hit $5 up to $10 after consolidating above the $1 level. On-Chain Data Suggests A Cardano Surge According to on-chain data, ADA is ready for another price run. Information from CoinMarketCap tells us that the token has already exceeded Binance in terms of 24-hour volume. A surging market volume suggests increased attention and interest in the asset.

Three days ago, Charles Gasparino, a Senior Correspondent at Fox Business, released a tweet highlighting the potential implications of Trump’s re-election for the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs. New US President Equals New SEC Chairman Gasparino cited the Commission’s decision to drop the appeal once a new administration takes over, likely once Trump is in the White House. Noteworthy, the Republican politician promised to oust Gary Gensler, the current agency chairman, on his first day in office. This means the SEC would get a new chairman, a position Robinhood CLO Dan Gallagher recently rejected . In addition, Gasparino quoted former Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Christopher Giancarlo, who also holds the same stance. SEC Has no Case Against Ripple Popular crypto lawyer Bill Morgan responded to Gasparino’s tweet, further emphasizing the possibility of having the SEC drop the appeal. He claimed that the appeal would be dropped because “there was no error made in the part of the case the SEC lost,” not because of political dynamics. In his opinion, the Commission’s move with the appeal is a political motive for continuing a near-hopeless appeal. Unfortunately, Gensler’s potential dethronement, tentatively scheduled for 20 January 2025, will also erase this political motive. This is the date of the official inauguration of the new US president. These comments have sparked significant discussion within the cryptocurrency community, and many crypto enthusiasts are still looking forward to the case’s eventual outcome. Judge Torres Rules in Partial Favor of Ripple For background on the Ripple-SEC case, Federal judge Analisa Torres differentiated between institutional and programmatic sales of XRP in July 2023. She categorized the first group as securities, while programmatic sales to retail investors were termed non-securities. As this verdict marked a partial victory for Ripple , the SEC contested it. In the meantime, trial dates for the unresolved appeals and claims in the Ripple-SEC lawsuit are scheduled for January 2025.

Last around $97,800, Bitcoin bulls remain optimistic that the world’s largest crypto may be about to vault above $100,000.

Why Microsoft can't afford NOT to buy #Bitcoin . Michael Saylor's 3 minute presentation FINALLY Revealed pic.twitter.com/qqQDVYepqa — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) December 1, 2024 Is Altcoin Season Officially On? Whilst all of this is great for Bitcoin, it’s arguably even better for altcoin markets, hence the recent decline in Bitcoin dominance. Altcoin markets were suppressed by a strongly anti-crypto Biden administration and SEC over the past three years. Crypto’s arch-enemy Gary Gensler will step down as SEC chair when Trump is inaugurated in January, and altcoin bulls are hoping this will herald the start of a new golden age for the US crypto industry. Whilst it remains to early to definitively say altcoin season is here – at 57%, Bitcoin dominance has only so far dropped back to its summer 2024 levels and CoinMarketCap’s altcoin index was last at 74 (75 means altcoin season) – a new alt season seems all but inevitable. XRP (XRP) has raced a staggering 322% higher in the past 30 days, adding a staggering more than $80 billion in value to cryptocurrency markets and taking the fourth largest crypto by market cap. Solana (SOL) recently hit new record highs in the $260s, Cardano (ADA) is up over 200% in 30 days, and Ethereum (ETH) is eyeing a retest of $4,000. But chart analysis suggests altcoin season could be about to accelerate, with Bitcoin dominance set to dive. X user Mikybull Crypto pointed out a pattern that Bitcoin dominance tends to remain at elevated levels until roughly 240 days after each halving, only to then dive spectacularly over the course of the next 6 or so months. Wow, Bitcoin dominance has just broken down the 2-year support. We are indeed officially in #ALTSEASON folks! https://t.co/IYfQF7P7XI pic.twitter.com/fVysBYuOKn — Mikybull Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) November 30, 2024 A closer look at the Bitcoin dominance chart also suggests a rising risk that the recent drop could accelerate. Bitcoin dominance has been trending higher within the confines of an upwards trend channel since mid-2023. But that trend channel is under threat of being broken imminently. If this trend line does break, chart analysis suggests a drop back towards a Bitcoin dominance percentage of 50% is likely. How Low Could Bitcoin Dominance Go? Back in January 2018, Bitcoin dominance fell as low as 35% during the first altcoin season before then bottoming out around 39% in 2021 through to late 2022 following the second altcoin season. One might assume then that altcoin season three might send Bitcoin dominance eventually as low as around 40%. Readers should understand, this isn’t to suggest that Bitcoin will do badly, only that altcoins will do better. And there are plenty of narratives to support the case for altcoin outperformance. In recent years, Bitcoin was insulated from SEC attacks and received Blackrock’s support, which culminated in the launch spot ETF launch in January. The same cannot be said for most of the rest of the altcoin market – the last few years has seen the SEC embark on a legal rampage called “regulation by enforcement” against major US crypto firms, which also saw them label dozens of major cryptos as digital securities. Admittedly, Ethereum was able to secure an ETF launch earlier this year, but initial enthusiasm was muted amid the ongoing altcoin market overhang. However, the prospect of a 180-degree shift towards pro-crypto policy has up until recently beaten down coins like XRP and ADA charging higher. All eyes are now on whether Ethereum can follow suit and break above its 2021 record highs about $1000 above current levels. Risks seem strongly tilted in favor of an upside breakout of the largest altcoin by market cap, and a further rapid decline in Bitcoin dominance. Smaller Coin to Consider As Altcoin Season Beacons Major altcoins are set to pump hard in the coming months. But the coins that will perform best are likely to be new, still relatively unknown but massively high-potential projects. There is a lot of chatter about micro-cap coins in the AI space, but traders shouldn’t overlook new meme coins . One name that has been getting a lot of attention in web3 circles in recent weeks has been Pepe Unchained (PEPU) . Pepe Unchained, an innovative meme-themed Ethereum layer-2 protocol that is busily building one of the most promising ecosystems in the crypto space, has raised over $60 million from early backers in its presale. Its huge presale success combined with rapid community growth sets up PEPU to potentially be the most explosive token launch of 2024. cryptonews.com ‘s in-house analyst Crypto Arjay outlines why the project has so much upside potential in the video below.

It is about an approach where every nuance is important: genetics, lifestyle, even the microcosm inside us. All this helps to create a treatment that works specifically for you. I wonder, how such approaches can change your health? Read on to learn about the latest advances in personalized medicine. Nanotechnology in medicine Nanomaterials have become widespread in medicine. This is understandable: the small size of the particles allows them to easily penetrate the skin and tissue. The main task of a person is to learn to control them. After all, uncontrolled nanoparticles in the human body can cause harm, not benefit. Let’s take, for example, particles of mineral dust – why not a nanomaterial? When inhaled, the particles firmly stick to the walls of the bronchi with sharp edges, causing severe lung disease. Scientists have solved this problem, learned how to model nanoparticles of the required size with specified properties. Targeted drug delivery technology using untethered microrobots. Now nanomaterials and nano-devices are widely used in diagnostics and treatment. Their importance is hard to overestimate. Targeted drug delivery technology using untethered microrobots. Source: iopscience.iop.org Targeted drug delivery systems have been created based on nanocapsules. Such capsules are made of a material neutral to the body, in which drugs are placed. The well-known drug ABRAXANE® for cancer treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (USA) was created according to the same principle. Nanocapsules are also used for targeted delivery of drugs for skin diseases and as part of nanogels for the transfer of stem cells. Pinpoint drug delivery reduces the toxic impact on healthy tissues, increases the effectiveness of the drug and accelerates recovery. Nanotechnology has made a real breakthrough in diagnostics. Thanks to nanoparticles, doctors can determine the disease at a lower molecular level, diagnosing the disease at the earliest stage. This is especially important for cancer. Nanoparticles are designed so that they bind to tumor biomarkers and become visible during examination. Thus, the disease is detected at the earliest stage. Nanosensors are successfully used in express tests for the early and rapid diagnosis of diabetes, heart attack and infectious diseases. Holographic technologies RealView Imaging Adopts Intel® RealSense Technology for HOLOSCOPE-i Holographic Augmented Reality Medical System. Therapeutic lasers help treat inflammation and speed up metabolism. But their capabilities do not end there: they are also used to create holographic images of internal organs. Holography is the process of recording and restoring three-dimensional images that are effectively used in minimally invasive surgeries and detailed examination of internal organs. This technology allows you to create and visualize volumetric holograms in space. One of the developers of such methods is RealView Imaging, an Israeli startup that develops applications for medical imaging. The system allows you to create online interactive three-dimensional images based on angiography and ultrasound data. RealView Imaging technology receives ultrasound, CT or MRI data and reconstructs this data in three-dimensional space, creating a hologram that a specialist can work with. Holographic technologies are successfully used in volumetric surgery . They reduce the rehabilitation period after interventions, improve the quality of treatment and the effectiveness of procedures. Virtual reality Due to the effect of full immersion, metaverses create the feeling that everything is happening in reality – this is exactly what is needed for medicine. Source: ourmetaversetimes.com The emergence of #metaverses can take medical practice to a new level. Telemedicine is one of the most promising areas for the use of virtual reality technologies, where extended consultations can be carried out. Metaverses are able to create the impression of reality due to the effect of deep immersion, which makes them ideal for such purposes. Doctors and patients can meet in a virtual office, using digital doubles for diagnosis and treatment at a distance. Metaverse Virtual Space (MVS) by Lado Okhotnikov for medicine and healthy lifestyle Lado Okhotnikov, CEO of Holiversе, the creator of the #Metaverse Virtual Space (MVS) metaverse did not stop at creating virtual reality. The company develops unique DNA-based avatars — digital models created by analyzing the human genome. The process begins with obtaining a sample of the user’s genetic material. This is usually done by swabbing the inside of the cheek. The sample is then sent to a lab for analysis. The lab sequences the entire genome. The genome consists of 3.5 billion base pairs, which represent the code for #DNA. This data is analyzed using artificial intelligence algorithms to compare the user’s unique genetic profile with databases of how the human body works at a molecular level. This reveals individual characteristics of the user, including their metabolism, potential susceptibility to various diseases, and even aging patterns. This information is used in conjunction with photos provided by the user to create a personalized digital avatar. A digital avatar is a mathematical model with many variables that predict how the body will respond to various life conditions, including diet, exercise, supplements, and medical interventions. The avatar will also be able to display changes in the user’s appearance over time, taking into account the impact of lifestyle on aging and health. Lado Okhotnikov continues to explore the possibilities of the virtual world in interaction with reality. He believes that investments in this area will benefit humanity: the technology for creating digital avatars will help avoid fatal errors during clinical drug trials and surgical interventions. According to him, these avatars are designed, among other things, to help the user better understand their body and make the right decision about treatment. Fundamental Surgery by FundamentalVR for surgical modeling and training An example of a successful combination of virtual and real is the Fundamental Surgery platform from the British company FundamentalVR, which specializes in VR technologies. The platform allows you to perform various operations in a safe environment, using haptic system and interactive elements. This helps surgeons improve their skills and prepare for real operating conditions without risk to patients. The company provides training and support to doctors in more than 30 countries. Fundamental Surgery allows doctors from all over the world to meet, consult patients, teach and learn new medical technologies. Brain — computer interface Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology developed at the beginning of the 21st century, which has received a new impetus for development along with #VR, #AI and other computer technologies. BCI allows you to control electronic devices with your thoughts. This field of science explores the possibilities of direct communication between the human brain and external devices, such as computers, robots and medical equipment. The development of this technology will open up new opportunities in medicine, entertainment and everyday life, providing people with alternative ways of interacting with the world around them. This tool is especially promising for people with disabilities. With the help of thought, people will be able to control objects, devices and communicate with other people. Health and longevity are one of the main priorities of our society. We have considered only a small part of the technologies that will help a person to prevent and treat diseases. But we must not forget that technologies are just tools in the hands of a person and they must be treated wisely and responsibly.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 23:28:00

The Democratic Party (DP), the largest party in the National Assembly, had threatened to thwart the ruling People’s Power Party (PPP)’s plans to postpone the launch. But the DP’s late bid to amend existing law in favor of its own proposal to instead raise the annual tax threshold for crypto traders has failed. Crypto Tax Launch Delayed Yet Again Money Today reported that Park Chan-dae, the DP’s floor leader, said the party had agreed to the government’s plan. Park was speaking at a press conference at the National Assembly on December 1. DP Floor Leader Park Chan-dae, speaking about crypto tax launch plans at a press conference at the South Korean National Assembly on December 1. (Source: MBC News/YouTube/Screenshot) Park said the decision had been made “after in-depth discussions on the postponement of taxation on virtual assets.” He agreed that “more institutional preparation” was “needed” before tax bodies started trying to tax crypto traders. This appears to echo the sentiments recently voiced by the DP leader Lee Jae-myung. Lee argued that crypto tax was not yet “systematically possible.” “We will process the government’s income tax law amendment bill to defer taxation on virtual assets at the National Assembly plenary session on December 2.” Park Chan-dae, lawmaker and DP Floor Leader It appears that the DP is making the concession so it can focus its attention on bills on the separate taxation of dividend income and the easing of inheritance tax, both of which it opposes. A South Korean crypto trader surnamed Kim told Cryptonews.com on December 1: “This whole situation about crypto tax is a complete mess. And politicians are squarely to blame for all of this. As a crypto investor, of course, I am happy not to pay tax. But this situation has been badly mishandled by the government, the opposition, and everyone else.” People Power Party Rep. Na Kyung-won proposed introducing a policy similar to France’s ""Pacte Civil de Solidarite"" to offer legal protection for children born to unmarried parents. https://t.co/i889BwHZe1 — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 1, 2024 Third Delay Lawmakers first voted in favor of launching crypto tax in December 2020. The levy was first scheduled for launch on January 1, 2021. However, its debut has since been postponed twice , on both occasions with just weeks to go before launch.

This bill proposed launching crypto tax per the existing schedule (January 2025). But the bill also proposed raising the annual threshold to 50 million won (around $36,000). This would have given crypto investors parity with stock market trading. The party reportedly claimed: “Most investors, except for a very small number of large-scale traders, will not end up being subject to taxation [under our proposal].” However, the PPP appears to have rebuffed the DP’s various attempts to force its bill through National Assembly subcommittees last week.

With so many options on the market, it’s not always easy to figure out which projects deserve your attention. Fortunately, some cryptos have already proven their value over time. Bitcoin, as the original cryptocurrency, continues to reign supreme, holding its status as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.Similarly, Stellar has emerged as a powerhouse in the world of cross-border payments. However, if you’re looking to step into something with massive potential and ground-breaking technology, then Qubetics might be exactly what you’re looking for. Qubetics is currently in the presale phase, selling $TICS tokens at a low price of $0.025, with analysts predicting that the token price could reach $10-$15 after the mainnet launch. With over 251 million tokens sold to more than 5000 holders, it’s clear that the momentum around Qubetics is building, and the presale stage is quickly becoming a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for those who want to invest early before the price skyrockets. Qubetics: Innovation at the Forefront with the QubeQode IDE When it comes to blockchain innovation, Qubetics is taking things to the next level. One of the standout features of the project is its QubeQode IDE, a tool designed to simplify the process of developing and deploying smart contracts. For anyone who’s ever tried to create a smart contract or build a blockchain application, you know how complicated and technical the process can be. That’s where Qubetics comes in, offering an intuitive, easy-to-use platform that eliminates the complexity. Developers no longer need to be experts in blockchain code to get started with building decentralized applications—QubeQode IDE takes care of much of the heavy lifting. This can radically expand the number of people who can participate in the blockchain revolution, from solo developers to large-scale enterprise teams. But the real magic happens when you think about the real-world applications of Qubetics. Imagine businesses that need to handle secure, automated transactions but are put off by the steep learning curve of blockchain development. With QubeQode, these businesses can quickly deploy smart contracts and integrate blockchain technology into their operations. In fact, Qubetics could solve major pain points for industries such as finance, supply chain, and healthcare. Additionally, Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet ensures that users maintain control over their own funds without the risk of third-party hacks or restrictions. As the market for decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to grow, Qubetics is well-positioned to become a major player in the space, offering tools that can simplify and secure the blockchain experience for everyone. Qubetics’ Presale: A Window of Opportunity for Early Investors If you’re wondering when to jump in on Qubetics, the presale stage is currently in full swing, and it’s one of the best crypto to invest in right now . As of now, Qubetics has raised over $3.9 million and sold more than 251 million tokens. The presale price is currently at $0.025 per token, which is incredibly affordable compared to the price forecasted after the mainnet launch. With analysts predicting that the price could surge to anywhere between $10-$15 per token after the mainnet goes live, the presale represents a unique chance to get in early on a project with huge growth potential. To date, more than 5300 holders have already invested in the presale, indicating strong confidence in the project and its future success. Investing in a presale offers a rare opportunity to acquire tokens at a discounted rate before the general public gets access. But it’s not just about the potential for high returns—it’s also about timing. As Qubetics continues to build out its infrastructure and gain traction, the value of $TICS tokens is only expected to rise. With the QubeQode IDE set to launch and the mainnet coming soon, this is the perfect time to consider getting involved in Qubetics. Whether you’re an experienced crypto investor or new to the scene, Qubetics’ presale represents a once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of a project that’s poised to reshape the blockchain landscape. Bitcoin: The King of Cryptos No discussion of the best crypto to invest in would be complete without mentioning Bitcoin. As the first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains a cornerstone of the crypto market. It is the digital gold of the space, widely seen as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Despite the volatility in the markets, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook continues to be strong. Over the past decade, Bitcoin has consistently proven to be a reliable investment, weathering downturns and emerging stronger each time. It is the benchmark cryptocurrency, and for many, Bitcoin remains the ultimate choice for anyone looking for stability in the unpredictable world of digital assets. Stellar: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments In the world of cross-border payments, Stellar is making a name for itself. The Stellar network is designed to allow quick and low-cost transfers of value across borders, which is a critical problem in today’s global economy. Whether it’s remittances, international trade, or micropayments, Stellar’s fast and cost-effective solution has garnered attention from financial institutions worldwide. With partnerships with large organizations like IBM, Stellar is cementing its place as one of the most important players in the crypto space. Its ability to streamline cross-border payments in ways traditional systems can’t make it a top contender for the best crypto to invest in. As the world continues to move toward a more digital, decentralized economy, Stellar’s potential to disrupt the financial system is only growing. Conclusion If you’re searching for the best crypto to invest in for 2024, it’s clear that both Bitcoin and Stellar offer stability and proven value. However, for those looking for the next big thing, Qubetics presents an exciting opportunity. With its QubeQode IDE, presale excitement, and strong analyst predictions, Qubetics is setting itself up to disrupt the blockchain industry and offer incredible returns for early investors.

Van Code has an interesting take on the transaction, attributing this activity to institutional investors. A very larger order of 2.1M #XRP just executed on #Binance . These are not whales. They are institutions buying. pic.twitter.com/hdR7x0Dl5P — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 1, 2024 This sentiment comes as XRP reaches a major milestone, recently crossing the $2 price point for the first time since 2018. The price movement reflects heightened interest in XRP, particularly as institutional players begin to recognize its potential as both an investment and a tool for blockchain-based financial services. When asked by a community member why the institutions waited this long to invest in XRP, Van Code remarked that institutions are now stepping in due to increased regulatory clarity, stating they feel safe from potential actions by Gary Gensler and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Shifting Regulatory Landscape XRP has been smashing through milestones since Donald Trump won the U.S. Presidential election. This rally intensified when Gensler, the SEC’s current Chair, hinted at a resignation. Gensler has led an anti-crypto war in the U.S. for years, and this caused institutions to stay away from cryptocurrencies like XRP and slowed the advancement of the U.S. crypto space. However, Trump supports the crypto market and has promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. Gensler has revealed that he will step down from his role on January 20, and anticipation of the Trump administration’s pro-crypto policies and potential crypto-friendly SEC Chair is already sending the market to new heights. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Rise Among Institutional Investors Institutions are returning to XRP, as multiple asset managers have recently filed applications to launch ETFs for XRP, and the WisdomTree XRP ETP recently debuted in Europe. These developments show a growing appetite for XRP among institutional investors, who view it as a versatile asset with long-term potential. The institutional interest is expected to intensify as the old administration transitions out of office. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has also been key in driving adoption through its blockchain-powered solutions. By partnering with financial institutions globally, Ripple is positioning XRP as a practical tool for efficient and cost-effective cross-border payments. This dual utility as a trading asset and a payment solution has made XRP increasingly attractive to institutional players, and this transaction might just be the first of many as XRP rises.

This puts Pump.fun’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) at $1.5 billion. Token Launch and New Trading Features The stake can be purchased on SecondLane’s web app and through its Telegram channel, where new offerings are regularly announced. Pump.fun, which has yet to launch a native token, is a Solana-based platform built around the meme coin trading frenzy. It has attracted a significant user base and boasts considerable transaction volume. According to DefiLlama data , Pump.fun is currently the eighth highest-earning blockchain protocol, just below key players such as Circle and Uniswap. Over the past 30 days, it has generated $86 million in fees, and its cumulative fee revenue exceeds $225 million. PitchBook shows that it has also raised funds from notable investors, including Alliance DAO, Big Brain Holdings, and 6th Man Ventures. In October 2024, the Pump.fun team hinted at a future token launch, although they did not provide a specific timeline for the event. They also shared plans for an upgraded trading terminal called “Pump Advance,” which is expected to introduce mini-charts, data on top holders, and social indicators to help traders navigate the increasingly crowded meme coin market. Incentives Amidst High Token Failure Rate Despite its popularity, Pump.fun is facing quite a few challenges. Data from Dune Analytics shows that about 98% of meme coins listed on the platform have failed. To address this, the team behind the project introduced an $80 incentive in August 2024 to encourage token creators to complete the bonding curve and successfully list their tokens on Raydium. The platform has also slashed its token launch fee from $2 to zero. The platform was also recently forced to press pause on its livestream feature following increased cases of inappropriate content. Some users had resorted to streaming acts of self-harm, threats of self-harm, or other disturbing or violent acts to pump their tokens. Meme coins, which are Pump.fun’s bread and butter have also caused mixed reactions within the crypto community. Prominent figures like former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) have criticized the growing number of these assets, suggesting that developers should focus on creating more useful blockchain applications. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also called for crypto builders to stop copying and pasting meme coins and instead make them into more exciting blockchain games.

Global trade has been a recurring bison for the crypto market but has performed poorly over the years due to regulatory and industry-related factors. The report, “From Digital Currency to Legal Tender: The Role of Regulated Stablecoins in Driving Real-World Payments,” drafted by Quinlan & Associates and IDA, shows limitations in present stablecoin utility, a possible pathway to asset adoption, and regulations. Per the release, stablecoins can transform cross-border payments and domestic trade through speed and security. Another major factor for stablecoin adoption is the ability to process transactions within 24 hours and make it more efficient. Several countries have also tried to make their stablecoin replica in the form of Central Bank Digital Currencies ( CBDCs ) backed with local assets. “ In the case of domestic payments, users can leverage programmable features to set self-executed scheduled top-ups, conditioned payments, and instant settlements. For cross-border payments, stablecoins can support faster, cheaper, and more transparent user experiences. In these two realms, stablecoins will play a critical role in supporting Hong Kong’s ambition to become a leading global Web3 hub.” Non-USD Stablecoin Can Raise Adoption At the moment, stablecoins account for 0.02% of global trades, a low figure compared to the level projected by maker participants. Two major reasons for this are regulation and the absence of non-USD stablecoins. According to the report, 83% of countries globally are not using USD as their main or substitute currency. Although USD remains the most popular asset, about 40% of global trade is in non-USD currencies creating a need for similar stablecoins. The absence of this creates scarcity in the market that could easily be filled boosting the total industry’s numbers. Lack of Regulation Stalls Adoption The stablecoin market cap stands at $200 billion, with USD-based assets making up the majority. Another factor responsible for the slow adoption is regulation. At the moment, some countries have yet to pass comprehensive crypto laws, creating a vacuum. This leads to regulatory uncertainty, plunging investor sentiments as they avoid such markets. The report states that 81% of global merchants cite the lack of proper regulations as a major barrier to the adoption of stablecoins. Adding to the complexities are frequent lawsuits filed by regulators due to an absence of rules. A notable example is the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approach in the last two years.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-01 23:53:04

Bitcoin dominance, which measures the market capitalization of Bitcoin influence in the cryptocurrency market, has dropped to 56% or shrunk from 60% in the past month, according to the data from TradingView . Analysts also projected that Bitcoin seems to dip below its long-standing support trend line, which refers to the key technical levels that record Bitcoin domination falling below a certain threshold. “Bitcoin dominance looks so ready to break down through its multi-year support trend line,” analyst says on his X post on Dec. 02.

This comes on the heels of the Binance listing , which sent the asset on an uphill climb. Thena claims to be an innovative decentralized liquidity layer deployed on the BNB network and has garnered steam this week. The trader used 698 BNB worth approximately $429K to purchase 416,897 $THE. As a result of the price rally, the asset soared in value to over $1 million, making the trader net a whopping $596K. This 196% growth in a short period sparked positive conversations within the community on the state of bull cycles. Crypto users pointed to the importance of alerts for centralized exchange listings to stay ahead of others in the market. Recently, the industry has recorded several token moves, resulting in high profits. Meme coins make up most of these assets due to their high volatility and community traction upon launch. Binance Listing Sends $THE To Impressive Heights Binance listings were at the center of the surge, and profits were made by several traders. Within 24 hours, the asset surged to a $233 million market cap as bulls set gaze for gains. The exchange also announced airdrops for users interacting with the Simple Earn product. Analysts posit that the listings will enable the asset to reach its potential, achieving a wider adoption with a better shot at strategic partnerships. X user @cryptokaduna wrote: “ Yesterday CZ tweeted: “I am not against memes, but meme coins are getting “a little” weird now. Let’s build real applications using blockchain. Then Binance listed $THE (a project on BSC). Will they continue to list more real applications on BSC? It seems like people are betting on $NMT.” Crypto Bulls Maintain Pressure Despite the price correction recorded earlier this week, a bullish presence in the market has taken the prices of assets upwards. This trajectory has seen Bitcoin price hit $96,470, a 5% rise in the last 24 hours. Similarly, altcoins such as Ethereum and Solana gained 9% and 4.4% respectively with ETF flows notching high spikes.

Table of Contents Dogecoin eyes $1 after golden cross formation IntelMarkets eyes $1, following 500% price pump Ethereum breaks out of H&S pattern Final Thoughts The crypto market has been on an uptrend, but crypto experts expect that the coin’s many top altcoins to pick up more pace over the next few weeks. Ethereum (ETH) is aiming for $5,800 after breaking out of a head and shoulders pattern. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) and a new AI coin called IntelMarkets (INTL) could see huge gains in the coming months. IntelMarkets is just in the sixth stage of its presale and has raised over $2.6 million. Dogecoin eyes $1 after golden cross formation Krisspax a leading expert, has noted that Dogecoin is displaying very bullish signals. According to him, the Dogecoin crypto has formed a new Golden Cross in the MACD averages below the zero level. This technical pattern is a bullish signal, which means the memecoin could surge to new levels in the coming weeks. With this positive charting formation, Krisspax believes the Dogecoin token could see an upward movement to $1. Such a potential surge makes DOGE one of the best meme coins to watch. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s price is attempting to climb above the $0.5 mark. CoinMarketCap data reveals it has gains of 10.5% and 139.0% on the biweekly and monthly levels. The cryptocurrency has a long way to go before it can cross $1.

Because IntelMarkets is set to transform the crypto trading space, experts expect INTL to reach $1 in the months ahead. One of the main features of IntelMarkets is the use of artificial intelligence in trading bots. These bots are created to help traders make automated trades. The bots can analyze market conditions and make changes to trading strategies in real-time. So, IntelMarkets’ AI bots are far more precise than any manual trader. This automation enables traders to take advantage of the opportunities at any one time without having to sit in front of the computer all the time. Besides the AI trading bots, IntelMarkets also has a reasonable fee structure that is important to traders in order to minimize their trading costs. It also has a no-KYC policy, which means that the identity of the users is not revealed when they are trading. This removes the stressful process of identity verification, thus allowing users to get started easily. IntelMarkets has also had its smart contracts audited by Cyberscope in order to ensure that its smart contracts are safe from hacks. This audit helps to build trust in the platform and gives traders confidence in the fairness of their transactions. Ethereum breaks out of H&S pattern Trader Tardigrade told his followers in a recent tweet that Ethereum has broken out of an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern. He said a retest to the $3,538-$3,445 range may be the last signal to enter these lower levels before the Ethereum coin skyrockets. With this breakout in place, the altcoin price is likely to explode to a new all-time high. Trader Tardigrade forecasts a target of $5,800 for the altcoin in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the sentiment around the Ethereum ETFs has improved. Over $200 million has flown into the ETF in the past week. Also, the VWMA (10) and Hull Moving Average (9) are flashing buy signals that support an uptrend. At the moment, the Ethereum price is trading above the $3,500 mark. There are profits of 6.0% on the weekly chart and 34.0% on the monthly level, according to CoinMarketCap.

Market Strategist Says WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Go From $0.017 To $11 First,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-price-to-hit-5-market-strategist-says-wallitiq-wltq/,"Speculations about the Dogecoin price in the crypto market are heating up, and recent forecasts from market strategists are suggesting that the Dogecoin price might reach the $5 mark. However, the attention of most investors is not on the Dogecoin price but on WallitIQ (WLTQ), as the same market strategist predicts that the newcomer, WLTQ, will rise from $0.017 to $11 before the Dogecoin price gets to $5. Unlock Unmatched Investment Potential With WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale WallitIQ (WLTQ) has positioned itself as a top contender in the crypto market with its impressive ongoing presale by presenting a decentralized crypto wallet that allows investors and traders to have total control over their portfolios and digital assets. By adopting AI solutions and machine learning algorithms, WallitIQ (WLTQ) promotes financial security, decentralization, and security for its users. Following the market strategist’s predictions of WallitIQ (WLTQ) to rise from its current presale price of $0.017 to $11, most investors are in doubt that the Dogecoin price will get to $5 in the near future. As a result, many of these investors are rapidly buying the WallitIQ native token, WLTQ in order to position themselves for massive future gains. Early investors in the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale will enjoy benefits such as referral bonuses, participation in governance decisions, early profits due to token price increases in the next presale stage, and much more. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) will provide its users access to blockchain-based activities like trading, yield farming, and staking activities. There are also incentives such as a 180% annual percentage yield (APY) when holders stake their tokens. Another outstanding feature that supports the market strategist‘s 64,665% gain prediction for WallitIQ (WLTQ) is its fast-rising acceptance among merchants and traders who aim to adopt its crypto wallet. The WallitIQ wallet provides top features such as a Scan and Pay QR functionality that eliminates errors and saves time during transactions and DeFi payments. WallitIQ (WLTQ) also combines advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to guarantee the investors’ private keys and transactions are protected from fraudulent interceptions, making WallitIQ (WLTQ) a highly secure yet user-friendly decentralized wallet. With the first presale stage still ongoing, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has continued to attract both retail and institutional investors looking to benefit from the market strategist’s projected price increase. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has bolstered the confidence of its users after undergoing a thorough smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof , a prominent cybersecurity and blockchain audit firm specializing in protecting blockchain projects and financial institutions from malicious attacks. Will Dogecoin Price Hit $5? The recent surge in the Dogecoin price has stirred a new debate among market strategists and investors on whether the Dogecoin will hit the $5 mark. Based on new Bitcoin ATHs and political developments, Dogecoin price volatility continues to maintain its relevance in the crypto market. Following Donald Trump’s victory in the just concluded U.S. presidential elections and his appointment of Elon Musk to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the interest in the Dogecoin price has increased among crypto enthusiasts. In the past, the Tesla CEO’s tweets have often influenced the Dogecoin price. The announcement of Musk’s involvement in this crypto-supportive government has further heightened investor interest in the meme coin. According to data from CoinGecko, Dogecoin’s market cap is at $56.7 billion with a daily trading volume of $12.4 billion. As of the time of this writing, the Dogecoin price is at $0.3861. Join The WallitIQ Presale For Massive Gains The impressive numbers in the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale mirror its growth potential and underscore the tremendous opportunity available for early investors. Following the market strategist predictions of WallitIQ (WLTQ) reaching $11 before tge Dogecoin price gets to its ambitious target of $5, smart investors are buying WLTQ tokens for a low price of $0.0171 in order to position themselves for unparalleled returns.

The Altcoin Season Index has reached 74/100, signaling a robust shift into alt dominance, while the Fear & Greed Index sits at an “Extreme Greed” level of 81—caution is advised, but the excitement is palpable. Source: coinmarketcap.com This week, we conclude our three-part series on the AI crypto sector. After exploring Fetch.ai ($FET ) and Render Network ($RNDR )—two giants with established reputations—it’s time to shed light on a true underdog: Opulous ($OPUL ). Ranked 824th with a market cap of just under $55M, OPUL is a fraction of FET ($4.7B) and RNDR ($4.69B), making it a potential dark horse in the AI coin race. Small in size but mighty in potential, OPUL represents a rare high-risk, high-reward play. Let’s dissect its fundamentals and technicals to see why it could outpace its larger peers. Opulous: Fundamentals at a Glance At its core, Opulous is revolutionizing music financing and rights management with blockchain technology. By tokenizing music royalties, the platform allows artists and fans to interact in an entirely new way. Its standout features include: Market Cap: $55M, ranked 824th. A minuscule valuation compared to Render’s $4.69B, highlighting the upside potential. Circulating Supply: Fully diluted at 500M tokens (no inflation risk; all tokens are already in circulation). CEX Listing Potential: Currently trading on niche platforms like MEXC and Gate.io. A listing on larger exchanges like Binance or Coinbase could transform its supply-demand dynamics, especially since liquidity is relatively scarce. In essence, Opulous combines blockchain utility with a niche, high-growth industry (music royalties). This unique narrative makes it stand out, especially as AI and decentralization converge across sectors. Technical Analysis: Resistance, Breakouts, and the Bigger Picture 1W Chart: The Battle at 12 Cents Price action this week underscores the importance of the $0.12 level—a confluence of horizontal resistance (where previous rallies have failed) and dynamic resistance (the 50-week and 100-week SMAs). A breakout above this zone would signal a major trend shift, but until then, caution is warranted. Let’s break this down:​ Dynamic Resistance: The 50-week SMA (simple moving average) curves upward just below $0.12. Think of it as a long-term moving trendline that acts as a ceiling until broken. (In simple terms: the 50 SMA tracks average prices over 50 weeks, smoothing out short-term noise.) Horizontal Resistance: Historical price action shows that $0.12 aligns with multiple rejection zones, making it a psychological and technical barrier. Why It Matters: Breaking above this confluence could lead to a rapid climb to $0.17 (next resistance) and beyond, as historical supply zones diminish. 1D Chart: Preparing for Lift-Off On the daily chart, OPUL has reclaimed the 200-day SMA ($0.09) for the first time in over a year—a textbook bullish signal. Volume, while still subdued, shows signs of rising, and the chart suggests a potential Golden Cross (when the 50D SMA crosses above the 200D SMA—a classic bullish formation). Key observations: Rejection Zone at $0.39: This level, the upper border of a 2.5-year accumulation range, rejected March’s rally, marking it as a critical take-profit target for long-term bulls. Golden Cross Alert: Expected in December if momentum holds. Strategies: Entering the Dark Horse Breakout Above $0.12 Why: A confirmed daily or weekly close above $0.12 validates the bullish trend, opening the door to $0.17 and beyond. Stop Loss: $0.11 (tight for breakout traders). Take Profit: $0.17 (initial resistance), $0.39 (long-term resistance). $0.09-$0.07 Accumulation Zone Why: Confluence of dynamic support (200 SMA on daily) and historical horizontal support. Stop Loss: $0.065 (below the 2.5-year accumulation range). Take Profit: $0.12-$0.17. Absolute Bottoms: $0.05 Zone Why: Final support level based on multiple retests during the bear market. Ideal for stink orders. Stop Loss: below $0.04. Take Profit: $0.09, $0.17, $0.39. Long-Term Targets: Moonshots and Reality Realistic Goals (2024): $0.17 (early 2023 resistance). $0.39 (March’s rejection zone). $1.00-$1.25 (historical key levels). Ultra-Optimistic Goals (2025): $3.50 (5x market cap). $7.67 (ATH from 2021 bull run). Risk vs. Reward: A breakout above $0.12 significantly reduces downside risk, but the low liquidity and small market cap could amplify volatility. Stick to a strategy and avoid emotional decisions. Summary: A Hidden Gem with Tremendous Potential Opulous represents the kind of opportunity that comes along rarely: a niche project with strong fundamentals, undervalued in market cap, and ripe for a breakout. However, patience is key. The $0.12 resistance zone remains a pivotal battleground, and a breakout will likely define the next leg of its journey. For now, keep an eye on volume, monitor the charts, and always respect stop-loss levels. As the final installment of our AI trilogy, Opulous stands out not just as a coin but as a story waiting to unfold. Small in size, colossal in potential—this dark horse could lead the race if the market aligns. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

From explosive presale performances to quirky tokens making headlines, meme coins are proving to be a gateway for crypto enthusiasts looking for quick wins. If you’re scouting for the best new meme coins to buy and hold for short-term gains, you’ve hit the jackpot. Today, we’ll be diving into three rising stars in the meme coin universe: BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Snek. First up, let’s talk about BTFD Coin , the current darling of the crypto community. This coin has been making waves with its presale performance, crossing impressive milestones at lightning speed. With over $400,000 raised and 10 billion coins sold so far, BTFD Coin has captured the hearts (and wallets) of investors globally. But hold on—Notcoin and Snek are no slouches either. Both of these tokens bring unique vibes to the table, offering exciting opportunities for those seeking fast returns. So, grab your popcorn and let’s break down why these three coins are the best new meme coins to buy and hold for short-term gains. BTFD Coin: Short-Term Gains with Long-Term Potential Let’s kick off with BTFD Coin, a meme coin that’s redefining how investors approach crypto dips. Short for Buy The Dip, BTFD Coin is all about encouraging investors to turn market downturns into profit opportunities. Its community-driven ethos, combined with a highly anticipated P2E game and staking rewards, makes it a powerhouse for short-term gains. As of its current presale stage (Stage 5), BTFD Coin is priced at $0.00005, with over $400,000 raised and 10 billion coins already snapped up by eager investors. This kind of performance screams potential. The presale has been smashing records, and analysts are buzzing about its likely price jump once it hits exchanges. Projections suggest it could debut at $0.0006—a significant leap from its presale price. Here’s the exciting part: if you invest $1,000 in the presale at $0.00005, you’d bag 20 million BTFD Coins. When the price rises to $0.0006, your investment would be worth a jaw-dropping $12,000. That’s the kind of short-term gain that makes meme coins irresistible. But BTFD Coin isn’t just about quick profits. Its ecosystem, complete with staking options offering an average APY of 90%, promises ongoing rewards for holders.

Its ability to balance short-term gains with user engagement is what makes it a top contender in the meme coin space. Snek: Slithering Its Way to Short-Term Success Last but certainly not least, we have Snek, a meme coin that’s equal parts charm and ambition. Inspired by the classic snake game, Snek is bringing retro vibes to the modern crypto scene. Its gamified ecosystem has captured the attention of gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike, making it a hot pick for short-term profits.

Most likely, it’s Ethereum. It’s the leader in smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), and it’s constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the blockchain space. But that’s not all. VeChain, a blockchain project focused on supply chain management, is quickly growing in prominence, solving real-world problems and building trust with enterprises globally. Both Ethereum and VeChain have made huge strides in the crypto world and continue to be some of the best crypto to invest in due to their established use cases and long-term potential. But wait—what if we told you that Qubetics is emerging as a major player, too? With its unique approach to blockchain technology, Qubetics is catching the eyes of investors. The project has just raised $3.9 million in its presale, and with over 5300 holders, it’s gaining serious momentum. Analysts are predicting that Qubetics could hit a price range of $10-15 after the mainnet launch, making it one of the best crypto to invest in for the future. Its QubeQode IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is set to revolutionize how developers interact with blockchain, giving them a platform to build and deploy decentralized applications seamlessly. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Blockchain with QubeQode IDE Qubetics isn’t your typical crypto project. While many focus solely on tokenomics or decentralized finance (DeFi), Qubetics is tackling the developer experience head-on. Its QubeQode IDE is a game-changer for the crypto world. Developers will have access to an all-in-one environment to build, test, and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) without the usual complexity. This makes it easier for both new and experienced developers to jump into the blockchain ecosystem. With Qubetics providing an intuitive platform, blockchain development becomes less intimidating, enabling more innovation in the space. What’s even more exciting? Qubetics’ presale numbers are through the roof. They’ve raised $3.9 million so far, with over 5300 holders and 251 million tokens sold in Phase 10. And at just $0.025 per token, there’s still an opportunity to get in early before Qubetics hits the big time. Analysts are predicting that once the mainnet launches, the price could soar to anywhere between $10-15 per token. With such a promising future and a unique offering in QubeQode, Qubetics is definitely one of the best crypto to invest in today. Ethereum: Still Leading the Charge When it comes to smart contracts, Ethereum is still the king. Its massive network and developer base make it the go-to platform for decentralized applications (dApps). The Ethereum ecosystem is vast and includes everything from DeFi to NFTs. And with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, Ethereum is transitioning to a more sustainable proof-of-stake model, which only increases its long-term viability. The network’s dominance in the blockchain space makes it one of the best crypto to invest in today, and it’s not showing signs of slowing down anytime soon. Ethereum’s strong presence in the DeFi space, its network of decentralized applications, and its partnerships with major companies all contribute to its continued success. If you’re looking for a safe bet in the world of crypto, Ethereum should definitely be on your radar. While there are other blockchains trying to compete, Ethereum’s ecosystem is tough to beat. For those seeking solid growth, Ethereum remains a leader in the market. VeChain: Supply Chain Management on Blockchain VeChain’s focus is on improving supply chain management through blockchain technology. By providing solutions for tracking products and ensuring transparency, VeChain is helping companies improve efficiency and reduce fraud. With a strong real-world use case, VeChain has partnered with major companies and governments worldwide to improve the traceability of goods and services. This makes VeChain a standout project in the blockchain space and one of the best crypto to invest in if you’re looking for something with tangible use in the supply chain sector. VeChain’s business model is based on providing blockchain solutions to industries, particularly in the supply chain. The network offers a platform for secure data sharing and tracking, which enhances transparency and reduces errors in the supply chain. As more industries look for ways to streamline their operations and reduce fraud, VeChain’s technology could become even more essential. For investors who are interested in a blockchain project with practical applications, VeChain is certainly worth considering. Conclusion While Ethereum and VeChain continue to make strides in their respective spaces, Qubetics offers something different—and perhaps even more exciting for future growth. The combination of a presale that’s already raised $3.5 million, a rapidly growing community, and analysts predicting a price surge to $10-15 after the mainnet launch, makes Qubetics one of the best crypto to invest in for 2024 and beyond. Its QubeQode IDE and tokenized marketplace are set to make a real impact on the blockchain world, attracting developers and businesses alike. With a promising future and innovative solutions for blockchain development, Qubetics is not just another project—it’s a movement. If you’re looking to diversify your crypto portfolio, Qubetics could be the perfect addition. With its impressive presale success and unique approach, it might just be the best crypto to invest in right now. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to get in early!

Want to know where the real opportunities are hiding in 2024? Well, look no further because Qubetics, Cronos, and Hedera are currently paving the way for some of the most promising investments in the market. Whether it’s Qubetics’ groundbreaking non-custodial wallet, Cronos’ ecosystem expansion, or Hedera’s role in scaling decentralized finance, these three cryptos have the potential to change the game. So, let’s dive into why they should be on your radar right now and why Qubetics is gearing up for an explosive post-mainnet launch. Qubetics: The Future of Crypto Wallets When we talk about the best cryptos to buy now, we can’t ignore Qubetics, especially with its innovative approach to blockchain technology. Qubetics is redefining the way we interact with digital assets, and it all begins with its non-custodial wallet. Now, you might be wondering, “What makes a non-custodial wallet so important?” Well, for starters, it gives users full control over their funds. No longer do you need to worry about relying on a third-party service to store your crypto. In a world where security risks are higher than ever, Qubetics offers a solution that puts privacy and control back into the hands of the users. The Qubetics wallet stands out because it’s designed to be user-friendly, even for those new to the crypto world. Unlike traditional wallets that can be complicated and require technical expertise, Qubetics offers an intuitive experience that allows anyone — from beginners to experts — to manage their digital assets securely. Whether you’re storing tokens, interacting with smart contracts, or participating in DeFi applications, the wallet makes it easy to do it all with a few clicks. This simple but powerful tool is likely to be a game-changer in how we approach blockchain and digital finance. But that’s just the beginning for Qubetics. The project is currently in its presale phase, raising an impressive $3.9 million and selling over 251 million tokens. Priced at just $0.025 per token during presale, analysts predict that the value of $TICS could soar to anywhere between $10 and $15 after its mainnet launch. That means if you get in now, you could be looking at incredible ROI once Qubetics hits the mainstream. With its innovative wallet and upcoming developments, Qubetics is poised for explosive growth, and now could be the perfect time to add this gem to your portfolio. Cronos: A Bridge Between Traditional Finance and DeFi Next up, let’s talk about Cronos, a blockchain that’s been making serious strides in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Cronos is a smart contract platform that focuses on creating an ecosystem that connects traditional finance with blockchain technology. What makes Cronos stand out is its unique positioning within the crypto space: it’s part of the Crypto.com family, which provides it with an established user base and access to millions of users worldwide. With its focus on scalability, interoperability, and security, Cronos is fast becoming a top choice for developers looking to build decentralized applications (dApps). One of Cronos’ most attractive features is its ability to offer fast transactions and low fees. In a space where transaction speed and costs can make or break a project, Cronos delivers on both fronts. This makes it an appealing choice for anyone looking to build on Ethereum but without the high gas fees that often come with it. Plus, Cronos is focused on bridging different blockchain ecosystems, making it easier for developers and users alike to move assets across different networks. If you’re someone looking for a project that’s scalable and has a strong community, Cronos might just be your ticket. Despite its promising tech and growing adoption, Cronos faces stiff competition in the DeFi space from giants like Ethereum and Solana. However, its close ties with Crypto.com give it a unique advantage, especially in terms of mainstream adoption and user accessibility. If you’re looking for a project that is building a powerful infrastructure for the future of decentralized finance, Cronos is certainly one to keep an eye on. Conclusion: The Future of Crypto Is Bright — Get In Now As we’ve seen, Qubetics, Cronos, and Hedera are three projects that have all the right ingredients to succeed in the evolving world of blockchain technology. Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet, Cronos’ DeFi ecosystem, or Hedera’s enterprise-ready scalability, these cryptos are positioning themselves for long-term growth. But if you’re looking for a project with explosive potential, Qubetics is the one to watch. With its presale raising millions and a future price prediction of $10-$15 per $TICS token after the mainnet launch, it’s clear that Qubetics is poised to be a major player in the crypto space. Add this to your portfolio now, and you could be looking at some seriously impressive returns in the near future. So, what are you waiting for? The best cryptos to invest in now are right in front of you. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to be part of the future of digital finance with Qubetics, Cronos, and Hedera.

Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, presented Bitcoin strategic reserve for Microsoft (MSFT) boards on Dec. 01 as he promised earlier . He highlighted that Bitcoin is a transformation of digital capital, and they need to adopt Bitcoin as part of their balance sheet in the next few years. Bitcoin is projected to be one of the biggest assets in the world and account for $280 trillion of global wealth, which exceeds gold and art by the next 20 years with $45 trillion and $110 trillion, respectively. Saylor also noted that Microsoft clearly needed to be powered by digital capital as the price movement of Bitcoin outperformed Microsoft shares by 12 times annually. MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares also jumped to 3,045% after acquiring Bitcoin in the past few years, while MSFT only performed 103%. “Bitcoin is the best asset that you can own. The number’s speaks for themselves. It is make alot more sense to buy Bitcoin than buy your own stock back, or to hold Bitcoin rather than holding bonds. If you wanted to outperform you gotta need Bitcoin,” Saylor mention on his presentation posted on YouTube. Political and market support, which is represented by Trump’s administration and Bitcoin ETF’s products in the stock market, will also make Bitcoin massively adopted in the next few years, so Microsoft has, too.

These digital assets have garnered attention for different reasons, from Dogecoin’s meme-driven popularity to XRP’s robust utility in cross-border transactions and PropiChain’s innovative approach to real estate investment. As investors seek the next big opportunity, the question arises: Which of these altcoins will soon create the most millionaires? Dogecoin Price Surge: Excitement or Overhype? The Dogecoin price is again making waves in the crypto world, surging to a live price of $0.3933 with an impressive 24-hour trading volume of $11.45 billion. This momentum, fueled by a remarkable 169.64% increase in the last 30 days, has cemented DOGE’s position as the #7 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at $57.77 billion. While the Dogecoin price rise is undeniably captivating, its foundation remains tied to external factors like the influence of Elon Musk’s tweets. This dependency makes DOGE a volatile investment. Without robust utility or innovation underpinning its growth, Dogecoin price faces challenges in maintaining its long-term appeal for serious investors. Legal Optimism Fuels a Record-Breaking XRP Price Rally The XRP price has surged an astonishing 218.68% since November 5, marking a remarkable rebound from its early November price of $0.51343. Currently trading at $1.67, XRP price is just 14% shy of its 2021 peak, with analysts setting their sights on a bold target of $4.20. This rally is underpinned by bullish technical indicators, particularly a golden cross, a rare alignment of the 50-day and 200-day SMAs on weekly charts. Historically, such signals have preceded the XRP price all-time highs, intensifying excitement among investors. Regulatory optimism and institutional adoption drive the XRP price growth, with trading volume at $8.4 billion. As Ripple’s SEC battle nears resolution, XRP price is poised to lead the crypto market and potentially achieve record-breaking performance. PCHAIN Beats Dogecoin Price and XRP Price PropiChain (PCHAIN) is poised to outperform the Dogecoin price and XRP price by revolutionizing the $300 trillion real estate market through blockchain and AI integration. Unlike Dogecoin’s meme-driven value and XRP’s regulatory challenges, PropiChain offers tangible utility by tokenizing real estate assets, enabling fractional ownership, and automating transactions via smart contracts. This approach democratizes property investment, providing stability and substantial growth potential. Analysts project that PropiChain could deliver returns up to 12,204%, surpassing the speculative gains of Dogecoin price and XRP price. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Revolutionizing Real Estate with Blockchain, AI, and NFTs PropiChain is reshaping the real estate space by combining blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and NFTs to address the inefficiencies of traditional property management. Built on a decentralized platform, PropiChain transforms real estate investment, ownership, and management into a simplified, secure, and globally accessible space. At its core, PropiChain leverages NFT tokenization to convert physical properties into digital assets. These NFTs represent ownership stakes, enabling fractional ownership where users can buy, sell, or trade portions of high-value properties. This democratization of real estate makes it accessible to a broader audience, eliminating barriers like exorbitant capital requirements and opaque pricing models. By tokenizing real estate, PropiChain brings liquidity to one of the most illiquid asset classes, allowing investors to diversify portfolios and easily trade their stakes. PropiChain’s integration of AI takes real estate management to new heights. The platform delivers real-time insights into property values, market trends, and investment opportunities through automated valuation models and predictive market analytics. Users can automate transactions based on specific conditions, optimizing strategies and minimizing risks. For instance, AI-powered tools can execute property purchases or sales automatically when predefined market criteria are met, ensuring efficiency and accuracy. PropiChain introduces the Propiverse, a metaverse-enabled feature that revolutionizes how investors explore and evaluate properties. Through immersive 3D virtual tours, users can interact with properties as if they were physically present. This eliminates geographical barriers and broadens investment opportunities. The PropiChain platform employs blockchain-based smart contracts to automate lease agreements, rental payments, and renewals. These contracts are tamper-proof and self-executing, ensuring transparency, reducing administrative burdens, and eliminating the need for intermediaries. Why Now Is the Best Time to Invest in PropiChain PropiChain’s presale offers a compelling opportunity for early investors, with the token currently priced at just $0.004. This low entry point is set to rise to $0.011 in stage two and climb even higher in later stages, rewarding those who act quickly with significant cost advantages. Early adopters benefit from discounted pricing and first-mover advantages, bolstered by PropiChain’s listing on CoinMarketCap and BlockAudit -certified security measures, which underscore its credibility. PropiChain outshines the Dogecoin price and XRP price by offering real-world utility and unmatched growth potential, making it the top choice for investors seeking high ROI and transformative opportunities. With the growing presale investments, now is the perfect time to seize this groundbreaking investment.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 02:27:00

Lightchain AI , priced at just $0.07 during its presale, is emerging as a transformative force in blockchain innovation. With its unique integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and cutting-edge decentralized technology, experts believe Lightchain AI could redefine how industries leverage blockchain. Why Lightchain AI Is a Game-Changer Lightchain AI is not just another cryptocurrency—it’s a platform designed to solve real-world challenges while pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology. Its revolutionary features, including Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , set it apart from traditional blockchains. Key Innovations That Stand Out: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Lightchain AI’s consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing AI computations, such as machine learning and data analysis, making it eco-friendly and utility-driven. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): AIVM enables the seamless execution of AI tasks directly on the blockchain, offering industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics an advanced, decentralized solution.
