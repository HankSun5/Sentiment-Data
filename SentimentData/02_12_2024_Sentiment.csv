In a new interview on the Altcoin Daily YouTube channel, Mark Yusko names his top token picks, including prominent smart contract platforms Solana ( SOL ) and Cardano ( ADA ). Other digital assets on the executive’s list include XRP , the digital asset associated with Ripple Labs, meme asset Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and layer-1 blockchain Hedera ( HBAR ). “I’ve become pretty partial to Solana, I got to say it. I mean, the guys have done a good job convincing me and you know, thankfully we didn’t sell our last bag and it’s gone from $13 to $240 or whatever so it’s pretty good.” Yusko goes on to say that if he had “money to lose,” he’d bet on ADA, XRP, and HBAR as some firms in the traditional finance (TradFi) world may eventually adopt the crypto assets to not get left behind. “If I had money that I was willing to lose – because I think you could literally lose it – I might actually own a little bit of [ADA, HBAR, and XRP] because… Depending on how this ‘czar’ position and all that stuff plays out, could I see a world in which, as a bridge to the future – meaning the incumbents don’t want to be displaced tomorrow – they say ‘You know what? Fine we’ll use XRP or we’ll use some Hedera thing and we’ll be crypto.'” Concluding with DOGE, Yusko says not owning the top meme token is a bet against billionaire Elon Musk. “Don’t bet against Elon, obviously. DOGE probably is not the dumbest thing in the world. I thought it was pretty dumb all the way from $0 to $60 billion so jokes on me, I’m the dumb one, but anyway, that’s probably it.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

With its impressive performance, it seems likely that the bulls will carry this rally until it reaches the $3 mark. Will the XRP Price Rally Continue? Following XRP’s latest achievement, participation from whales and investors has skyrocketed and is raising one common question – Will this rally continue, or is there a chance of a price correction in the coming days? $256M of XRP Inflow, Sell-off Incoming? The on-chain analytics firm Coinglass recently reported that amid the ongoing bull rally, whales and institutions have been consistently dumping millions of dollars worth of XRP onto exchanges. According to Coinglass’s XRP spot inflow/outflow data, exchanges have witnessed a significant inflow of $256.30 million in the past three days. Source: Coinglass This substantial inflow suggests that whales and institutions have transferred their holdings to exchanges. In the cryptocurrency landscape, such inflows typically indicate a potential sell-off and an impending price decline. Traders Strong Bests on Long Side In addition to whale participation, traders appear more optimistic, strongly betting on long positions, as indicated by Coinglass. At press time, the XRP Long/Short ratio on the four-hour timeframe stands at 1.98, indicating a strong bullish sentiment among traders. Currently, 66.5% of top traders across exchanges hold long positions, while 33.5% hold short positions. This data indicates that, in the short term, bulls are dominating the altcoin, which could support XRP in continuing its rally toward $3. XRP Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level An analysis of these on-chain metrics suggests that bulls are currently in control, potentially supporting XRP’s price and ongoing rally. However, the activity of whales and institutions, along with the $256.30 million worth of XRP offloaded, signals a potential price correction in the coming days. XRP Price Prediction According to CoinPedia’s technical analysis, XRP has broken through the highly anticipated resistance level of $2. Following this breakout, there is a strong possibility that it could soar to $3.15 in the coming days. However, the price could experience a minor correction or a breakout retest before the rally continues toward the $3 mark. Source: Trading View Currently, XRP is trading near $2.17 and has registered a price gain of over 15% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume decreased by 14%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-01 21:01:57

Five digital coins are poised for potential explosive growth, offering the chance for remarkable returns. This article delves into these promising assets that could deliver astonishing gains by Christmas. CYBRO Presale Soars Past $5.5 Million: A One-in-a-Million NeoBank Investment Opportunity CYBRO is capturing the attention of crypto whales as its exclusive token presale quickly surges above $5.5 million. This cutting-edge NeoBank offers investors unparalleled opportunities to enhance crypto earnings across multiple blockchains. The presale has now reached its 8th stage out of 10, marking the final opportunity to acquire CYBRO tokens at the presale price of just $0.045 each. With only two stages remaining, time is running out to invest before the Token Generation Event (TGE), where prices are expected to skyrocket. Experts are forecasting a potential ROI of 1200%, solidifying CYBRO’s status as a transformative opportunity in the DeFi and NeoBank sectors. In addition to tokens, CYBRO introduces special Points, offering even more opportunities for investors. Holders of these Points will automatically participate in the CYBRO Airdrop, where the more Points you hold, the more tokens you will receive. CYBRO distributes up to 1 million Points weekly, which can be earned by investing in DeFi Vaults in the CYBRO app. Holders of CYBRO tokens will enjoy lucrative staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, cashback on purchases, reduced trading and lending fees, and a robust insurance program within the platform. With only 21% of the total tokens available for this presale and approximately 80 million already sold, this is a golden opportunity for savvy investors to secure a stake in a project that's truly one in a million. >>>Join CYBRO and aim for future returns up to 1200% Solana's Scalable Blockchain: Discovering SOL's Role in Dapps Development Solana is a blockchain platform that focuses on scalability. It provides a base for decentralized applications, known as dapps. Competing with platforms like Ethereum and Cardano, Solana aims for faster transactions through its unique architecture. It supports development in multiple programming languages, making it flexible for developers. SOL is the native cryptocurrency of Solana. It is essential to the ecosystem. SOL is used for transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding those who support the network. The coin holds value as it powers the Solana ecosystem and gives users access to various projects. Solana does not use sharding or second-layer solutions for scalability. Instead, it attracts developers and investors with its high-capacity network. Avalanche (AVAX): A Layer-1 Blockchain Offering Speed and Customization Avalanche (AVAX) is a Layer-1 blockchain platform that provides eco-friendly operations, low transaction fees, and high-speed processing with a capacity of 4,500 transactions per second. It enables users to launch customizable Subnets for tailored blockchain deployments. Avalanche employs a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines classical and Nakamoto consensus principles, achieving transaction finality in less than two seconds. The platform consists of three interoperable chains—the X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain—that manage various functions like transactions and smart contract executions. AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by covering transaction fees, securing the network through staking, and facilitating the operation of multiple Subnets, supporting payments, staking, and the creation of custom tokens and blockchains. Polkadot's DOT: Enhancing Blockchain Connectivity and Scalability Polkadot is a decentralized protocol and cryptocurrency that enables secure communication between different blockchains like Ethereum and Bitcoin. It allows value and data to be shared without intermediaries. By using parachains, Polkadot enhances speed and scalability, processing transactions much faster than Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Polkadot token (DOT) is used for governance and staking within its network, allowing holders to participate in the protocol's development and transaction verification. Developed by Ethereum co-creator Gavin Wood and maintained by the Web3 Foundation, Polkadot aims to create more interconnected and efficient blockchains. Introducing POL: Powering the Polygon Ecosystem The Polygon Ecosystem Token (POL) is a utility token at the core of the Polygon network. It facilitates a range of operations and services across the ecosystem. Holders can stake their tokens, participating in network security and consensus, and earn additional tokens based on the amount staked. POL also enables governance, giving holders the right to vote on proposals that influence the development and direction of the network. Additionally, it grants access to exclusive services within the ecosystem, unlocking special features and applications. With its wide array of use cases, POL plays a crucial role in the growth and functionality of the Polygon ecosystem. Conclusion In conclusion, while SOL, AVAX, DOT, and POL show potential, their short-term prospects seem limited. In contrast, CYBRO stands out as an advanced DeFi platform offering investors exceptional opportunities to boost earnings through AI-powered yield aggregation on the Blast blockchain. With features like generous staking rewards, exclusive airdrops, and cashback on purchases, CYBRO provides a superior user experience with smooth deposits and withdrawals. Focusing on transparency, compliance, and quality, CYBRO has attracted significant interest from major crypto investors and influencers, marking it as a promising project in the current bull run.

Will Trump’s deregulation do it again?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/lack-of-oversight-crashed-crypto-once-will-trumps-deregulation-do-it-again/,"The last crypto crash didn’t happen because there were too many rules. It happened because there were barely any. Back in 2022, crypto giants treated the market like a game board. Risky bets, shady leverage, and zero accountability made them billions until it all fell apart. Companies like Terraform, FTX, and Celsius went down in flames, leaving ordinary investors broke. Fast forward to today. Trump’s win has the crypto industry popping champagne. Bitcoin prices have surged nearly 40%, brushing against $100,000. The market cap has jumped by over $1 trillion. The president, once a critic of crypto, is now its loudest cheerleader. He’s promised to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” But with promises of deregulation and industry-friendly policies, skeptics can’t help but wonder if Trump’s crypto revolution is setting the stage for another collapse. The push for less regulation The industry spent over $100 million on the election—almost half of all corporate political spending. It seems to be paying off. Reports say Trump is letting crypto insiders pick the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Gary Gensler, the current SEC chair and a proud crypto hater, plans to step down before Trump takes office. The president had said publicly he’d fire Gensler on day one. Elon Musk, Trump’s ally and crypto enthusiast, has joined the fight for deregulation. He took to his X platform (formerly Twitter) to call for the “deletion” of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency designed to protect consumers from financial scams. According to Elon, the U.S. has “too many duplicative regulatory agencies.” His comment got cheers from crypto fans who see government oversight as the enemy of innovation. Of course, the billionaire’s influence in the crypto industry doesn’t stop with tweets. Dogecoin, the meme coin he’s championed, has skyrocketed 150% since Trump’s election victory. Why? Because “DOGE” is now shorthand for the “Department of Government Efficiency,” Elon’s new agency. Trump’s personal ties to crypto Trump’s sons are involved in World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture that stands to benefit from favorable regulations. Critics say this creates a conflict of interest. Trump’s policies could directly enrich his family while manipulating the market. And it’s not just his family. Crypto titans are backing Trump with both money and influence. The $100 million they funneled into the election wasn’t charity. They want a return on their investment, starting with lenient rules and friendlier regulators. If Trump delivers, it could turn the U.S. into a haven for crypto innovation—or a playground for unchecked greed. The stakes are higher now than in 2021. Back then, crypto was largely isolated from traditional finance. Its crashes didn’t get far beyond the market. That’s not the case anymore. The SEC’s recent approval of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has tethered crypto to the global financial system. BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has already attracted $48 billion, drawing in hedge funds, retirement accounts, and institutional investors. This integration makes the market more vulnerable. A crypto collapse today would likely affect banks, pensions, and the global economy itself.",OP-ED|BTC|USA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2024-12-01 21:20:34

The crypto landscape is ever-evolving, and meme coins have carved out an intriguing niche. They’re not just about fun and games; they represent a unique blend of community spirit and investment potential. In this article, we’ll dive into some exciting new players, including BTFD Coin, Cat in a Dog’s World, and Act I: The AI Prophecy, and explore what makes them stand out in this crowded space. One of the most thrilling newcomers on the block is BTFD Coin, which has already made waves with its presale success. In just 24 hours, it raised over $200,000, and now, in the 5th stage of its presale, it has surpassed $420,000, selling more than 10 billion coins to over 1000 holders. The enthusiasm around BTFD Coin is palpable, and it’s clear that this project is poised for greatness. With a maximum supply of 173 billion coins, it’s designed to engage a wide audience and encourage community involvement through various incentives like staking rewards and gaming features. In contrast, we’ll also look at established players like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, which have solidified their positions as top contenders in the meme coin arena. These projects have been around for a while, yet they continue to attract attention and investment, serving as alternative assets in a volatile market. Understanding their journey can provide valuable insights into what makes a meme coin successful and how new entries like BTFD Coin can learn from their strategies. BTFD Coin: The Next-Gen Meme Coin Supremo BTFD Coin is not just another meme coin; it’s a phenomenon that’s capturing the hearts and wallets of investors. With its presale hitting the ground running, BTFD Coin has sold over 10 billion coins, attracting over 1000 holders, raising more than $420,000 in the process. But what truly sets it apart? For starters, the presale is currently in its 5th stage, with the 6th stage set to unlock once 15 billion coins are sold. The current price of $0.00005 is a bargain compared to the projected presale end price of $0.0006, suggesting a 14900% ROI for early investors. What’s more, BTFD Coin has a unique Play2Earn game that encourages user engagement and offers real rewards. Imagine playing a fun game while earning coins—sounds like a win-win, right? This gamification aspect appeals particularly to younger audiences, who are increasingly drawn to interactive investment opportunities. The staking rewards further enhance its attractiveness, allowing holders to earn passive income simply by holding their coins. Community engagement is at the heart of BTFD Coin’s strategy. For instance, the project allocates 17% of its maximum supply to Rage Bull Gaming Rewards, which not only incentivises participation but also helps in building a robust community around the coin. This creates a sense of belonging, turning casual investors into dedicated supporters Cat in a Dog’s World: A New Contender Next up, we have Cat in a Dog’s World, a fresh face in the meme coin scene that’s generating buzz for its innovative approach. This project is all about breaking the norms and offering something different. It taps into the playful rivalry between cats and dogs, creating a narrative that resonates with pet lovers and meme enthusiasts alike. What sets Cat in a Dog’s World apart is its community-driven ethos. It encourages holders to participate in various activities, from social media campaigns to local meet-ups, fostering a sense of camaraderie among its users. This approach not only builds a loyal following but also increases visibility in the crowded crypto market. Moreover, Cat in a Dog’s World has implemented features that allow holders to earn rewards through participation in community events and initiatives. This engagement helps to create a vibrant ecosystem where users feel valued and involved. Imagine being part of a community where your love for pets translates into tangible rewards—it’s an enticing proposition for many. As we look at the broader market, it’s clear that Cat in a Dog’s World is vying for a spot alongside the heavyweights. Its unique branding and community focus may just be the ticket to establishing itself as one of the best new meme coins to buy in December 2024. Act I: The AI Prophecy: Blending Technology with Meme Culture Lastly, let’s dive into Act I: The AI Prophecy. This project uniquely combines cutting-edge AI technology with the playful energy of meme culture. It’s an ambitious undertaking that seeks to harness the power of artificial intelligence to enhance user experience and engagement within the crypto space. Act I offers a distinctive proposition: it uses AI algorithms to analyse market trends and user behaviour, providing invaluable insights to its community. This not only empowers investors but also helps them make informed decisions as they navigate the often unpredictable crypto landscape. The integration of AI into the meme coin realm is not just innovative; it’s a game-changer. The project also emphasises community engagement, similar to what we see with BTFD Coin and Cat in a Dog’s World. Holders are encouraged to participate in governance, influencing the direction of the project and its features. This democratic approach fosters loyalty and makes users feel like active contributors rather than passive investors. As for investment potential, the early buzz around Act I: The AI Prophecy indicates it could be one of the best new meme coins to buy in December 2024. Its unique selling points and the integration of AI technology position it as a strong contender in the meme coin market. Join the Next Meme Coin Bull Run with BTFD Coin!

The areas with the highest levels of crypto exposure in 2021 also experienced significant increases in both mortgage and auto loan origination and balance figures in the following years. Crypto Gains and Larger Mortgages The report revealed that for low-income households in areas with high crypto exposure, the mortgage rate jumped from 4.1% in January 2020 to 15.4% in January 2024, almost four times higher. The average mortgage balance increased by over 150%, from almost $172K to a little over $443K, indicating that profits from crypto sales may have helped with larger down payments. Low-income households in high-crypto areas earn an average of $40,664, which results in a mortgage debt-to-income ratio of 0.53, well above the recommended 0.36 and the 0.43 required for some standard loans. The report suggests that this high ratio is concerning because it’s linked to a greater risk of default, particularly during financial crises. On the other hand, in low-crypto areas, low-income households have a much lower debt-to-income ratio of 0.19, with an average mortgage balance of $136,481 and income of $35,950. This suggests that the rise in mortgage debt in recent years may be mainly happening in high-crypto areas, which might increase financial instability. From 2020 to 2024, mortgage delinquency rates dropped across the board, particularly among low-income households. The decline in delinquency was similar across areas with high and low crypto exposure. For example, delinquency fell by 4.2% in high-crypto areas and 3.8% in low-crypto areas for low-income groups. High-crypto areas had lower delinquency rates in 2020, so the percentage drop was bigger there. For high-income households, delinquency rates showed little change. As of Q1 2024, delinquency rates are at their lowest in 15 years, around 1.7%, with no signs of “distress” in high-crypto areas. Auto Loan Debt Hits $1.6T, Crypto Areas See Largest Increases Auto loan debt has surged to over $1.6 trillion as of early 2024, with notable increases among low-income households, particularly in high-crypto exposure areas. Between 2020 and 2024, average auto loan balances for low-income households grew by 52% in high-crypto areas compared to a 38% rise in low-crypto areas. This could potentially suggest that crypto earnings or windfalls may have enabled more vehicle purchases. On the other hand, middle- and high-income households saw decreases in their average auto loan balances during the same period, though those in high-crypto areas experienced smaller declines or even slight increases.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 22:05:00

Analyst Thinks It’s Happening This Cycle,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-to-hit-10-analyst-thinks-its-happening-this-cycle/,"As Bitcoin leads the charge for crypto this cycle, with its price teasing the $100k level, many analysts offer predictions on top altcoins. One token that’s widely seen to surge in this cycle is Cardano (ADA), a popular proof-of-stake blockchain that supports dApps. If one crypto analyst is to be believed, Cardano can hit $10 in this current bull cycle. According to Lark Davis, the token’s 213% monthly surge only scratches the surface of its full potential. Cardano has been one of the top-performing digital assets in the last few weeks. With its over 200% gain in one month, Cardano’s market cap is nearing that of USDC. And for Davis, he expects that this “Ethereum killer” will reach an all-time high of $10 this cycle. Can Cardano Surge To $10? If Davis’ predictions hold, Cardano’s price will grow by 800%. The popular crypto commentator suggests that it’s never too late to invest in the asset. Davis’ assertion is based on observations that Cardano still has room for growth. BREAKING: Lark Davis says “ #Cardano ‘s getting the attention and the hype, we could see $10.00 $ADA .” pic.twitter.com/oOpCx0DuI6 — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) November 29, 2024 Davis explains that strong macroeconomic indicators back Cardano, and there’s still hype on its use cases and ecosystem. He mentioned that the attention and favorable market conditions would let the token “run real hard and real fast”. Davis expects Cardano to continue its run in the short term, and its price will hit $3.16. From this price point, the token can increase by 332%, at the back of a 1.618 Fibonacci level, with a price of $4.80. He expects more price action for Cardano, and when the Fibonacci level reaches 2.618, the token’s price can hit $7.70. Finally, Davis sees Caradno making another push to $10 behind a Fibonacci level score of 3.618. Cardano’s Market Dominance According to Davis, Cardano had 4% market dominance in the last cycle. He analyzed that the token’s market cap can increase 10x in the current market valuation, pushing its valuation to roughly $370 billion. This 10-fold increase in market valuation will be reflected in its price, pushing Cardano past the $10 level. In short, the prediction of its Fibonacci price level matches the analyst’s expectations of its market cap. Other market analysts also echo Davis’ price assessment for Cardano. For example. Dan Gambardello shared that the token can hit $5 up to $10 after consolidating above the $1 level. On-Chain Data Suggests A Cardano Surge According to on-chain data, ADA is ready for another price run. Information from CoinMarketCap tells us that the token has already exceeded Binance in terms of 24-hour volume. A surging market volume suggests increased attention and interest in the asset.

Three days ago, Charles Gasparino, a Senior Correspondent at Fox Business, released a tweet highlighting the potential implications of Trump’s re-election for the ongoing legal battle between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ripple Labs. New US President Equals New SEC Chairman Gasparino cited the Commission’s decision to drop the appeal once a new administration takes over, likely once Trump is in the White House. Noteworthy, the Republican politician promised to oust Gary Gensler, the current agency chairman, on his first day in office. This means the SEC would get a new chairman, a position Robinhood CLO Dan Gallagher recently rejected . In addition, Gasparino quoted former Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), Christopher Giancarlo, who also holds the same stance. SEC Has no Case Against Ripple Popular crypto lawyer Bill Morgan responded to Gasparino’s tweet, further emphasizing the possibility of having the SEC drop the appeal. He claimed that the appeal would be dropped because “there was no error made in the part of the case the SEC lost,” not because of political dynamics. In his opinion, the Commission’s move with the appeal is a political motive for continuing a near-hopeless appeal. Unfortunately, Gensler’s potential dethronement, tentatively scheduled for 20 January 2025, will also erase this political motive. This is the date of the official inauguration of the new US president. These comments have sparked significant discussion within the cryptocurrency community, and many crypto enthusiasts are still looking forward to the case’s eventual outcome. Judge Torres Rules in Partial Favor of Ripple For background on the Ripple-SEC case, Federal judge Analisa Torres differentiated between institutional and programmatic sales of XRP in July 2023. She categorized the first group as securities, while programmatic sales to retail investors were termed non-securities. As this verdict marked a partial victory for Ripple , the SEC contested it. In the meantime, trial dates for the unresolved appeals and claims in the Ripple-SEC lawsuit are scheduled for January 2025.

Last around $97,800, Bitcoin bulls remain optimistic that the world’s largest crypto may be about to vault above $100,000.

Why Microsoft can't afford NOT to buy #Bitcoin . Michael Saylor's 3 minute presentation FINALLY Revealed pic.twitter.com/qqQDVYepqa — Altcoin Daily (@AltcoinDailyio) December 1, 2024 Is Altcoin Season Officially On? Whilst all of this is great for Bitcoin, it’s arguably even better for altcoin markets, hence the recent decline in Bitcoin dominance. Altcoin markets were suppressed by a strongly anti-crypto Biden administration and SEC over the past three years. Crypto’s arch-enemy Gary Gensler will step down as SEC chair when Trump is inaugurated in January, and altcoin bulls are hoping this will herald the start of a new golden age for the US crypto industry. Whilst it remains to early to definitively say altcoin season is here – at 57%, Bitcoin dominance has only so far dropped back to its summer 2024 levels and CoinMarketCap’s altcoin index was last at 74 (75 means altcoin season) – a new alt season seems all but inevitable. XRP (XRP) has raced a staggering 322% higher in the past 30 days, adding a staggering more than $80 billion in value to cryptocurrency markets and taking the fourth largest crypto by market cap. Solana (SOL) recently hit new record highs in the $260s, Cardano (ADA) is up over 200% in 30 days, and Ethereum (ETH) is eyeing a retest of $4,000. But chart analysis suggests altcoin season could be about to accelerate, with Bitcoin dominance set to dive. X user Mikybull Crypto pointed out a pattern that Bitcoin dominance tends to remain at elevated levels until roughly 240 days after each halving, only to then dive spectacularly over the course of the next 6 or so months. Wow, Bitcoin dominance has just broken down the 2-year support. We are indeed officially in #ALTSEASON folks! https://t.co/IYfQF7P7XI pic.twitter.com/fVysBYuOKn — Mikybull Crypto (@MikybullCrypto) November 30, 2024 A closer look at the Bitcoin dominance chart also suggests a rising risk that the recent drop could accelerate. Bitcoin dominance has been trending higher within the confines of an upwards trend channel since mid-2023. But that trend channel is under threat of being broken imminently. If this trend line does break, chart analysis suggests a drop back towards a Bitcoin dominance percentage of 50% is likely. How Low Could Bitcoin Dominance Go? Back in January 2018, Bitcoin dominance fell as low as 35% during the first altcoin season before then bottoming out around 39% in 2021 through to late 2022 following the second altcoin season. One might assume then that altcoin season three might send Bitcoin dominance eventually as low as around 40%. Readers should understand, this isn’t to suggest that Bitcoin will do badly, only that altcoins will do better. And there are plenty of narratives to support the case for altcoin outperformance. In recent years, Bitcoin was insulated from SEC attacks and received Blackrock’s support, which culminated in the launch spot ETF launch in January. The same cannot be said for most of the rest of the altcoin market – the last few years has seen the SEC embark on a legal rampage called “regulation by enforcement” against major US crypto firms, which also saw them label dozens of major cryptos as digital securities. Admittedly, Ethereum was able to secure an ETF launch earlier this year, but initial enthusiasm was muted amid the ongoing altcoin market overhang. However, the prospect of a 180-degree shift towards pro-crypto policy has up until recently beaten down coins like XRP and ADA charging higher. All eyes are now on whether Ethereum can follow suit and break above its 2021 record highs about $1000 above current levels. Risks seem strongly tilted in favor of an upside breakout of the largest altcoin by market cap, and a further rapid decline in Bitcoin dominance. Smaller Coin to Consider As Altcoin Season Beacons Major altcoins are set to pump hard in the coming months. But the coins that will perform best are likely to be new, still relatively unknown but massively high-potential projects. There is a lot of chatter about micro-cap coins in the AI space, but traders shouldn’t overlook new meme coins . One name that has been getting a lot of attention in web3 circles in recent weeks has been Pepe Unchained (PEPU) . Pepe Unchained, an innovative meme-themed Ethereum layer-2 protocol that is busily building one of the most promising ecosystems in the crypto space, has raised over $60 million from early backers in its presale. Its huge presale success combined with rapid community growth sets up PEPU to potentially be the most explosive token launch of 2024. cryptonews.com ‘s in-house analyst Crypto Arjay outlines why the project has so much upside potential in the video below.

It is about an approach where every nuance is important: genetics, lifestyle, even the microcosm inside us. All this helps to create a treatment that works specifically for you. I wonder, how such approaches can change your health? Read on to learn about the latest advances in personalized medicine. Nanotechnology in medicine Nanomaterials have become widespread in medicine. This is understandable: the small size of the particles allows them to easily penetrate the skin and tissue. The main task of a person is to learn to control them. After all, uncontrolled nanoparticles in the human body can cause harm, not benefit. Let’s take, for example, particles of mineral dust – why not a nanomaterial? When inhaled, the particles firmly stick to the walls of the bronchi with sharp edges, causing severe lung disease. Scientists have solved this problem, learned how to model nanoparticles of the required size with specified properties. Targeted drug delivery technology using untethered microrobots. Now nanomaterials and nano-devices are widely used in diagnostics and treatment. Their importance is hard to overestimate. Targeted drug delivery technology using untethered microrobots. Source: iopscience.iop.org Targeted drug delivery systems have been created based on nanocapsules. Such capsules are made of a material neutral to the body, in which drugs are placed. The well-known drug ABRAXANE® for cancer treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (USA) was created according to the same principle. Nanocapsules are also used for targeted delivery of drugs for skin diseases and as part of nanogels for the transfer of stem cells. Pinpoint drug delivery reduces the toxic impact on healthy tissues, increases the effectiveness of the drug and accelerates recovery. Nanotechnology has made a real breakthrough in diagnostics. Thanks to nanoparticles, doctors can determine the disease at a lower molecular level, diagnosing the disease at the earliest stage. This is especially important for cancer. Nanoparticles are designed so that they bind to tumor biomarkers and become visible during examination. Thus, the disease is detected at the earliest stage. Nanosensors are successfully used in express tests for the early and rapid diagnosis of diabetes, heart attack and infectious diseases. Holographic technologies RealView Imaging Adopts Intel® RealSense Technology for HOLOSCOPE-i Holographic Augmented Reality Medical System. Therapeutic lasers help treat inflammation and speed up metabolism. But their capabilities do not end there: they are also used to create holographic images of internal organs. Holography is the process of recording and restoring three-dimensional images that are effectively used in minimally invasive surgeries and detailed examination of internal organs. This technology allows you to create and visualize volumetric holograms in space. One of the developers of such methods is RealView Imaging, an Israeli startup that develops applications for medical imaging. The system allows you to create online interactive three-dimensional images based on angiography and ultrasound data. RealView Imaging technology receives ultrasound, CT or MRI data and reconstructs this data in three-dimensional space, creating a hologram that a specialist can work with. Holographic technologies are successfully used in volumetric surgery . They reduce the rehabilitation period after interventions, improve the quality of treatment and the effectiveness of procedures. Virtual reality Due to the effect of full immersion, metaverses create the feeling that everything is happening in reality – this is exactly what is needed for medicine. Source: ourmetaversetimes.com The emergence of #metaverses can take medical practice to a new level. Telemedicine is one of the most promising areas for the use of virtual reality technologies, where extended consultations can be carried out. Metaverses are able to create the impression of reality due to the effect of deep immersion, which makes them ideal for such purposes. Doctors and patients can meet in a virtual office, using digital doubles for diagnosis and treatment at a distance. Metaverse Virtual Space (MVS) by Lado Okhotnikov for medicine and healthy lifestyle Lado Okhotnikov, CEO of Holiversе, the creator of the #Metaverse Virtual Space (MVS) metaverse did not stop at creating virtual reality. The company develops unique DNA-based avatars — digital models created by analyzing the human genome. The process begins with obtaining a sample of the user’s genetic material. This is usually done by swabbing the inside of the cheek. The sample is then sent to a lab for analysis. The lab sequences the entire genome. The genome consists of 3.5 billion base pairs, which represent the code for #DNA. This data is analyzed using artificial intelligence algorithms to compare the user’s unique genetic profile with databases of how the human body works at a molecular level. This reveals individual characteristics of the user, including their metabolism, potential susceptibility to various diseases, and even aging patterns. This information is used in conjunction with photos provided by the user to create a personalized digital avatar. A digital avatar is a mathematical model with many variables that predict how the body will respond to various life conditions, including diet, exercise, supplements, and medical interventions. The avatar will also be able to display changes in the user’s appearance over time, taking into account the impact of lifestyle on aging and health. Lado Okhotnikov continues to explore the possibilities of the virtual world in interaction with reality. He believes that investments in this area will benefit humanity: the technology for creating digital avatars will help avoid fatal errors during clinical drug trials and surgical interventions. According to him, these avatars are designed, among other things, to help the user better understand their body and make the right decision about treatment. Fundamental Surgery by FundamentalVR for surgical modeling and training An example of a successful combination of virtual and real is the Fundamental Surgery platform from the British company FundamentalVR, which specializes in VR technologies. The platform allows you to perform various operations in a safe environment, using haptic system and interactive elements. This helps surgeons improve their skills and prepare for real operating conditions without risk to patients. The company provides training and support to doctors in more than 30 countries. Fundamental Surgery allows doctors from all over the world to meet, consult patients, teach and learn new medical technologies. Brain — computer interface Brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology developed at the beginning of the 21st century, which has received a new impetus for development along with #VR, #AI and other computer technologies. BCI allows you to control electronic devices with your thoughts. This field of science explores the possibilities of direct communication between the human brain and external devices, such as computers, robots and medical equipment. The development of this technology will open up new opportunities in medicine, entertainment and everyday life, providing people with alternative ways of interacting with the world around them. This tool is especially promising for people with disabilities. With the help of thought, people will be able to control objects, devices and communicate with other people. Health and longevity are one of the main priorities of our society. We have considered only a small part of the technologies that will help a person to prevent and treat diseases. But we must not forget that technologies are just tools in the hands of a person and they must be treated wisely and responsibly.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-01 23:28:00

The Democratic Party (DP), the largest party in the National Assembly, had threatened to thwart the ruling People’s Power Party (PPP)’s plans to postpone the launch. But the DP’s late bid to amend existing law in favor of its own proposal to instead raise the annual tax threshold for crypto traders has failed. Crypto Tax Launch Delayed Yet Again Money Today reported that Park Chan-dae, the DP’s floor leader, said the party had agreed to the government’s plan. Park was speaking at a press conference at the National Assembly on December 1. DP Floor Leader Park Chan-dae, speaking about crypto tax launch plans at a press conference at the South Korean National Assembly on December 1. (Source: MBC News/YouTube/Screenshot) Park said the decision had been made “after in-depth discussions on the postponement of taxation on virtual assets.” He agreed that “more institutional preparation” was “needed” before tax bodies started trying to tax crypto traders. This appears to echo the sentiments recently voiced by the DP leader Lee Jae-myung. Lee argued that crypto tax was not yet “systematically possible.” “We will process the government’s income tax law amendment bill to defer taxation on virtual assets at the National Assembly plenary session on December 2.” Park Chan-dae, lawmaker and DP Floor Leader It appears that the DP is making the concession so it can focus its attention on bills on the separate taxation of dividend income and the easing of inheritance tax, both of which it opposes. A South Korean crypto trader surnamed Kim told Cryptonews.com on December 1: “This whole situation about crypto tax is a complete mess. And politicians are squarely to blame for all of this. As a crypto investor, of course, I am happy not to pay tax. But this situation has been badly mishandled by the government, the opposition, and everyone else.” People Power Party Rep. Na Kyung-won proposed introducing a policy similar to France’s ""Pacte Civil de Solidarite"" to offer legal protection for children born to unmarried parents. https://t.co/i889BwHZe1 — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 1, 2024 Third Delay Lawmakers first voted in favor of launching crypto tax in December 2020. The levy was first scheduled for launch on January 1, 2021. However, its debut has since been postponed twice , on both occasions with just weeks to go before launch. Korea's exports grow for 14th month in Nov. on record shipments of chips https://t.co/9iqTzZH7h2 — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) December 1, 2024 DP lawmakers last week tried to convince the government to accept a rival bill . This bill proposed launching crypto tax per the existing schedule (January 2025). But the bill also proposed raising the annual threshold to 50 million won (around $36,000). This would have given crypto investors parity with stock market trading. The party reportedly claimed: “Most investors, except for a very small number of large-scale traders, will not end up being subject to taxation [under our proposal].” However, the PPP appears to have rebuffed the DP’s various attempts to force its bill through National Assembly subcommittees last week.

With so many options on the market, it’s not always easy to figure out which projects deserve your attention. Fortunately, some cryptos have already proven their value over time. Bitcoin, as the original cryptocurrency, continues to reign supreme, holding its status as a store of value and a hedge against inflation.Similarly, Stellar has emerged as a powerhouse in the world of cross-border payments. However, if you’re looking to step into something with massive potential and ground-breaking technology, then Qubetics might be exactly what you’re looking for. Qubetics is currently in the presale phase, selling $TICS tokens at a low price of $0.025, with analysts predicting that the token price could reach $10-$15 after the mainnet launch. With over 251 million tokens sold to more than 5000 holders, it’s clear that the momentum around Qubetics is building, and the presale stage is quickly becoming a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for those who want to invest early before the price skyrockets. Qubetics: Innovation at the Forefront with the QubeQode IDE When it comes to blockchain innovation, Qubetics is taking things to the next level. One of the standout features of the project is its QubeQode IDE, a tool designed to simplify the process of developing and deploying smart contracts. For anyone who’s ever tried to create a smart contract or build a blockchain application, you know how complicated and technical the process can be. That’s where Qubetics comes in, offering an intuitive, easy-to-use platform that eliminates the complexity. Developers no longer need to be experts in blockchain code to get started with building decentralized applications—QubeQode IDE takes care of much of the heavy lifting. This can radically expand the number of people who can participate in the blockchain revolution, from solo developers to large-scale enterprise teams. But the real magic happens when you think about the real-world applications of Qubetics. Imagine businesses that need to handle secure, automated transactions but are put off by the steep learning curve of blockchain development. With QubeQode, these businesses can quickly deploy smart contracts and integrate blockchain technology into their operations. In fact, Qubetics could solve major pain points for industries such as finance, supply chain, and healthcare. Additionally, Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet ensures that users maintain control over their own funds without the risk of third-party hacks or restrictions. As the market for decentralized finance (DeFi) continues to grow, Qubetics is well-positioned to become a major player in the space, offering tools that can simplify and secure the blockchain experience for everyone. Qubetics’ Presale: A Window of Opportunity for Early Investors If you’re wondering when to jump in on Qubetics, the presale stage is currently in full swing, and it’s one of the best crypto to invest in right now . As of now, Qubetics has raised over $3.9 million and sold more than 251 million tokens. The presale price is currently at $0.025 per token, which is incredibly affordable compared to the price forecasted after the mainnet launch. With analysts predicting that the price could surge to anywhere between $10-$15 per token after the mainnet goes live, the presale represents a unique chance to get in early on a project with huge growth potential. To date, more than 5300 holders have already invested in the presale, indicating strong confidence in the project and its future success. Investing in a presale offers a rare opportunity to acquire tokens at a discounted rate before the general public gets access. But it’s not just about the potential for high returns—it’s also about timing. As Qubetics continues to build out its infrastructure and gain traction, the value of $TICS tokens is only expected to rise. With the QubeQode IDE set to launch and the mainnet coming soon, this is the perfect time to consider getting involved in Qubetics. Whether you’re an experienced crypto investor or new to the scene, Qubetics’ presale represents a once-in-a-lifetime chance to be part of a project that’s poised to reshape the blockchain landscape. Bitcoin: The King of Cryptos No discussion of the best crypto to invest in would be complete without mentioning Bitcoin. As the first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin remains a cornerstone of the crypto market. It is the digital gold of the space, widely seen as a store of value and a hedge against inflation. Despite the volatility in the markets, Bitcoin’s long-term outlook continues to be strong. Over the past decade, Bitcoin has consistently proven to be a reliable investment, weathering downturns and emerging stronger each time. It is the benchmark cryptocurrency, and for many, Bitcoin remains the ultimate choice for anyone looking for stability in the unpredictable world of digital assets. Stellar: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments In the world of cross-border payments, Stellar is making a name for itself. The Stellar network is designed to allow quick and low-cost transfers of value across borders, which is a critical problem in today’s global economy. Whether it’s remittances, international trade, or micropayments, Stellar’s fast and cost-effective solution has garnered attention from financial institutions worldwide. With partnerships with large organizations like IBM, Stellar is cementing its place as one of the most important players in the crypto space. Its ability to streamline cross-border payments in ways traditional systems can’t make it a top contender for the best crypto to invest in. As the world continues to move toward a more digital, decentralized economy, Stellar’s potential to disrupt the financial system is only growing. Conclusion If you’re searching for the best crypto to invest in for 2024, it’s clear that both Bitcoin and Stellar offer stability and proven value. However, for those looking for the next big thing, Qubetics presents an exciting opportunity. With its QubeQode IDE, presale excitement, and strong analyst predictions, Qubetics is setting itself up to disrupt the blockchain industry and offer incredible returns for early investors.

Van Code has an interesting take on the transaction, attributing this activity to institutional investors. A very larger order of 2.1M #XRP just executed on #Binance . These are not whales. They are institutions buying. pic.twitter.com/hdR7x0Dl5P — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) December 1, 2024 This sentiment comes as XRP reaches a major milestone, recently crossing the $2 price point for the first time since 2018. The price movement reflects heightened interest in XRP, particularly as institutional players begin to recognize its potential as both an investment and a tool for blockchain-based financial services. When asked by a community member why the institutions waited this long to invest in XRP, Van Code remarked that institutions are now stepping in due to increased regulatory clarity, stating they feel safe from potential actions by Gary Gensler and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Shifting Regulatory Landscape XRP has been smashing through milestones since Donald Trump won the U.S. Presidential election. This rally intensified when Gensler, the SEC’s current Chair, hinted at a resignation. Gensler has led an anti-crypto war in the U.S. for years, and this caused institutions to stay away from cryptocurrencies like XRP and slowed the advancement of the U.S. crypto space. However, Trump supports the crypto market and has promised to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world. Gensler has revealed that he will step down from his role on January 20, and anticipation of the Trump administration’s pro-crypto policies and potential crypto-friendly SEC Chair is already sending the market to new heights. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Rise Among Institutional Investors Institutions are returning to XRP, as multiple asset managers have recently filed applications to launch ETFs for XRP, and the WisdomTree XRP ETP recently debuted in Europe. These developments show a growing appetite for XRP among institutional investors, who view it as a versatile asset with long-term potential. The institutional interest is expected to intensify as the old administration transitions out of office. Ripple, the company behind XRP, has also been key in driving adoption through its blockchain-powered solutions. By partnering with financial institutions globally, Ripple is positioning XRP as a practical tool for efficient and cost-effective cross-border payments. This dual utility as a trading asset and a payment solution has made XRP increasingly attractive to institutional players, and this transaction might just be the first of many as XRP rises.

This puts Pump.fun’s fully diluted valuation (FDV) at $1.5 billion. Token Launch and New Trading Features The stake can be purchased on SecondLane’s web app and through its Telegram channel, where new offerings are regularly announced. Pump.fun, which has yet to launch a native token, is a Solana-based platform built around the meme coin trading frenzy. It has attracted a significant user base and boasts considerable transaction volume. According to DefiLlama data , Pump.fun is currently the eighth highest-earning blockchain protocol, just below key players such as Circle and Uniswap. Over the past 30 days, it has generated $86 million in fees, and its cumulative fee revenue exceeds $225 million. PitchBook shows that it has also raised funds from notable investors, including Alliance DAO, Big Brain Holdings, and 6th Man Ventures. In October 2024, the Pump.fun team hinted at a future token launch, although they did not provide a specific timeline for the event. They also shared plans for an upgraded trading terminal called “Pump Advance,” which is expected to introduce mini-charts, data on top holders, and social indicators to help traders navigate the increasingly crowded meme coin market. Incentives Amidst High Token Failure Rate Despite its popularity, Pump.fun is facing quite a few challenges. Data from Dune Analytics shows that about 98% of meme coins listed on the platform have failed. To address this, the team behind the project introduced an $80 incentive in August 2024 to encourage token creators to complete the bonding curve and successfully list their tokens on Raydium. The platform has also slashed its token launch fee from $2 to zero. The platform was also recently forced to press pause on its livestream feature following increased cases of inappropriate content. Some users had resorted to streaming acts of self-harm, threats of self-harm, or other disturbing or violent acts to pump their tokens. Meme coins, which are Pump.fun’s bread and butter have also caused mixed reactions within the crypto community. Prominent figures like former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) have criticized the growing number of these assets, suggesting that developers should focus on creating more useful blockchain applications. Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has also called for crypto builders to stop copying and pasting meme coins and instead make them into more exciting blockchain games.

Global trade has been a recurring bison for the crypto market but has performed poorly over the years due to regulatory and industry-related factors. The report, “From Digital Currency to Legal Tender: The Role of Regulated Stablecoins in Driving Real-World Payments,” drafted by Quinlan & Associates and IDA, shows limitations in present stablecoin utility, a possible pathway to asset adoption, and regulations. Per the release, stablecoins can transform cross-border payments and domestic trade through speed and security. Another major factor for stablecoin adoption is the ability to process transactions within 24 hours and make it more efficient. Several countries have also tried to make their stablecoin replica in the form of Central Bank Digital Currencies ( CBDCs ) backed with local assets. “ In the case of domestic payments, users can leverage programmable features to set self-executed scheduled top-ups, conditioned payments, and instant settlements. For cross-border payments, stablecoins can support faster, cheaper, and more transparent user experiences. In these two realms, stablecoins will play a critical role in supporting Hong Kong’s ambition to become a leading global Web3 hub.” Non-USD Stablecoin Can Raise Adoption At the moment, stablecoins account for 0.02% of global trades, a low figure compared to the level projected by maker participants. Two major reasons for this are regulation and the absence of non-USD stablecoins. According to the report, 83% of countries globally are not using USD as their main or substitute currency. Although USD remains the most popular asset, about 40% of global trade is in non-USD currencies creating a need for similar stablecoins. The absence of this creates scarcity in the market that could easily be filled boosting the total industry’s numbers. Lack of Regulation Stalls Adoption The stablecoin market cap stands at $200 billion, with USD-based assets making up the majority. Another factor responsible for the slow adoption is regulation. At the moment, some countries have yet to pass comprehensive crypto laws, creating a vacuum. This leads to regulatory uncertainty, plunging investor sentiments as they avoid such markets. The report states that 81% of global merchants cite the lack of proper regulations as a major barrier to the adoption of stablecoins. Adding to the complexities are frequent lawsuits filed by regulators due to an absence of rules. A notable example is the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) approach in the last two years.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2024-12-01 23:53:04

This comes on the heels of the Binance listing , which sent the asset on an uphill climb. Thena claims to be an innovative decentralized liquidity layer deployed on the BNB network and has garnered steam this week. The trader used 698 BNB worth approximately $429K to purchase 416,897 $THE. As a result of the price rally, the asset soared in value to over $1 million, making the trader net a whopping $596K. This 196% growth in a short period sparked positive conversations within the community on the state of bull cycles. Crypto users pointed to the importance of alerts for centralized exchange listings to stay ahead of others in the market. Recently, the industry has recorded several token moves, resulting in high profits. Meme coins make up most of these assets due to their high volatility and community traction upon launch. Binance Listing Sends $THE To Impressive Heights Binance listings were at the center of the surge, and profits were made by several traders. Within 24 hours, the asset surged to a $233 million market cap as bulls set gaze for gains. The exchange also announced airdrops for users interacting with the Simple Earn product. Analysts posit that the listings will enable the asset to reach its potential, achieving a wider adoption with a better shot at strategic partnerships. X user @cryptokaduna wrote: “ Yesterday CZ tweeted: “I am not against memes, but meme coins are getting “a little” weird now. Let’s build real applications using blockchain. Then Binance listed $THE (a project on BSC). Will they continue to list more real applications on BSC? It seems like people are betting on $NMT.” Crypto Bulls Maintain Pressure Despite the price correction recorded earlier this week, a bullish presence in the market has taken the prices of assets upwards. This trajectory has seen Bitcoin price hit $96,470, a 5% rise in the last 24 hours. Similarly, altcoins such as Ethereum and Solana gained 9% and 4.4% respectively with ETF flows notching high spikes.

Table of Contents Dogecoin eyes $1 after golden cross formation IntelMarkets eyes $1, following 500% price pump Ethereum breaks out of H&S pattern Final Thoughts The crypto market has been on an uptrend, but crypto experts expect that the coin’s many top altcoins to pick up more pace over the next few weeks. Ethereum (ETH) is aiming for $5,800 after breaking out of a head and shoulders pattern. Meanwhile, Dogecoin (DOGE) and a new AI coin called IntelMarkets (INTL) could see huge gains in the coming months. IntelMarkets is just in the sixth stage of its presale and has raised over $2.6 million. Dogecoin eyes $1 after golden cross formation Krisspax a leading expert, has noted that Dogecoin is displaying very bullish signals. According to him, the Dogecoin crypto has formed a new Golden Cross in the MACD averages below the zero level. This technical pattern is a bullish signal, which means the memecoin could surge to new levels in the coming weeks. With this positive charting formation, Krisspax believes the Dogecoin token could see an upward movement to $1. Such a potential surge makes DOGE one of the best meme coins to watch. Meanwhile, Dogecoin’s price is attempting to climb above the $0.5 mark. CoinMarketCap data reveals it has gains of 10.5% and 139.0% on the biweekly and monthly levels. The cryptocurrency has a long way to go before it can cross $1.

Because IntelMarkets is set to transform the crypto trading space, experts expect INTL to reach $1 in the months ahead. One of the main features of IntelMarkets is the use of artificial intelligence in trading bots. These bots are created to help traders make automated trades. The bots can analyze market conditions and make changes to trading strategies in real-time. So, IntelMarkets’ AI bots are far more precise than any manual trader. This automation enables traders to take advantage of the opportunities at any one time without having to sit in front of the computer all the time. Besides the AI trading bots, IntelMarkets also has a reasonable fee structure that is important to traders in order to minimize their trading costs. It also has a no-KYC policy, which means that the identity of the users is not revealed when they are trading. This removes the stressful process of identity verification, thus allowing users to get started easily. IntelMarkets has also had its smart contracts audited by Cyberscope in order to ensure that its smart contracts are safe from hacks. This audit helps to build trust in the platform and gives traders confidence in the fairness of their transactions. Ethereum breaks out of H&S pattern Trader Tardigrade told his followers in a recent tweet that Ethereum has broken out of an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern. He said a retest to the $3,538-$3,445 range may be the last signal to enter these lower levels before the Ethereum coin skyrockets. With this breakout in place, the altcoin price is likely to explode to a new all-time high. Trader Tardigrade forecasts a target of $5,800 for the altcoin in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the sentiment around the Ethereum ETFs has improved. Over $200 million has flown into the ETF in the past week. Also, the VWMA (10) and Hull Moving Average (9) are flashing buy signals that support an uptrend. At the moment, the Ethereum price is trading above the $3,500 mark. There are profits of 6.0% on the weekly chart and 34.0% on the monthly level, according to CoinMarketCap.

Market Strategist Says WallitIQ (WLTQ) Will Go From $0.017 To $11 First,https://timestabloid.com/dogecoin-price-to-hit-5-market-strategist-says-wallitiq-wltq/,"Speculations about the Dogecoin price in the crypto market are heating up, and recent forecasts from market strategists are suggesting that the Dogecoin price might reach the $5 mark. However, the attention of most investors is not on the Dogecoin price but on WallitIQ (WLTQ), as the same market strategist predicts that the newcomer, WLTQ, will rise from $0.017 to $11 before the Dogecoin price gets to $5. Unlock Unmatched Investment Potential With WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale WallitIQ (WLTQ) has positioned itself as a top contender in the crypto market with its impressive ongoing presale by presenting a decentralized crypto wallet that allows investors and traders to have total control over their portfolios and digital assets. By adopting AI solutions and machine learning algorithms, WallitIQ (WLTQ) promotes financial security, decentralization, and security for its users. Following the market strategist’s predictions of WallitIQ (WLTQ) to rise from its current presale price of $0.017 to $11, most investors are in doubt that the Dogecoin price will get to $5 in the near future. As a result, many of these investors are rapidly buying the WallitIQ native token, WLTQ in order to position themselves for massive future gains. Early investors in the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale will enjoy benefits such as referral bonuses, participation in governance decisions, early profits due to token price increases in the next presale stage, and much more. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) will provide its users access to blockchain-based activities like trading, yield farming, and staking activities. There are also incentives such as a 180% annual percentage yield (APY) when holders stake their tokens. Another outstanding feature that supports the market strategist‘s 64,665% gain prediction for WallitIQ (WLTQ) is its fast-rising acceptance among merchants and traders who aim to adopt its crypto wallet. The WallitIQ wallet provides top features such as a Scan and Pay QR functionality that eliminates errors and saves time during transactions and DeFi payments. WallitIQ (WLTQ) also combines advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to guarantee the investors’ private keys and transactions are protected from fraudulent interceptions, making WallitIQ (WLTQ) a highly secure yet user-friendly decentralized wallet. With the first presale stage still ongoing, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has continued to attract both retail and institutional investors looking to benefit from the market strategist’s projected price increase. Furthermore, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has bolstered the confidence of its users after undergoing a thorough smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof , a prominent cybersecurity and blockchain audit firm specializing in protecting blockchain projects and financial institutions from malicious attacks. Will Dogecoin Price Hit $5? The recent surge in the Dogecoin price has stirred a new debate among market strategists and investors on whether the Dogecoin will hit the $5 mark. Based on new Bitcoin ATHs and political developments, Dogecoin price volatility continues to maintain its relevance in the crypto market. Following Donald Trump’s victory in the just concluded U.S. presidential elections and his appointment of Elon Musk to head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the interest in the Dogecoin price has increased among crypto enthusiasts. In the past, the Tesla CEO’s tweets have often influenced the Dogecoin price. The announcement of Musk’s involvement in this crypto-supportive government has further heightened investor interest in the meme coin. According to data from CoinGecko, Dogecoin’s market cap is at $56.7 billion with a daily trading volume of $12.4 billion. As of the time of this writing, the Dogecoin price is at $0.3861. Join The WallitIQ Presale For Massive Gains The impressive numbers in the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale mirror its growth potential and underscore the tremendous opportunity available for early investors. Following the market strategist predictions of WallitIQ (WLTQ) reaching $11 before tge Dogecoin price gets to its ambitious target of $5, smart investors are buying WLTQ tokens for a low price of $0.0171 in order to position themselves for unparalleled returns.

The Altcoin Season Index has reached 74/100, signaling a robust shift into alt dominance, while the Fear & Greed Index sits at an “Extreme Greed” level of 81—caution is advised, but the excitement is palpable. Source: coinmarketcap.com This week, we conclude our three-part series on the AI crypto sector. After exploring Fetch.ai ($FET ) and Render Network ($RNDR )—two giants with established reputations—it’s time to shed light on a true underdog: Opulous ($OPUL ). Ranked 824th with a market cap of just under $55M, OPUL is a fraction of FET ($4.7B) and RNDR ($4.69B), making it a potential dark horse in the AI coin race. Small in size but mighty in potential, OPUL represents a rare high-risk, high-reward play. Let’s dissect its fundamentals and technicals to see why it could outpace its larger peers. Opulous: Fundamentals at a Glance At its core, Opulous is revolutionizing music financing and rights management with blockchain technology. By tokenizing music royalties, the platform allows artists and fans to interact in an entirely new way. Its standout features include: Market Cap: $55M, ranked 824th. A minuscule valuation compared to Render’s $4.69B, highlighting the upside potential. Circulating Supply: Fully diluted at 500M tokens (no inflation risk; all tokens are already in circulation). CEX Listing Potential: Currently trading on niche platforms like MEXC and Gate.io. A listing on larger exchanges like Binance or Coinbase could transform its supply-demand dynamics, especially since liquidity is relatively scarce. In essence, Opulous combines blockchain utility with a niche, high-growth industry (music royalties). This unique narrative makes it stand out, especially as AI and decentralization converge across sectors. Technical Analysis: Resistance, Breakouts, and the Bigger Picture 1W Chart: The Battle at 12 Cents Price action this week underscores the importance of the $0.12 level—a confluence of horizontal resistance (where previous rallies have failed) and dynamic resistance (the 50-week and 100-week SMAs). A breakout above this zone would signal a major trend shift, but until then, caution is warranted. Let’s break this down:​ Dynamic Resistance: The 50-week SMA (simple moving average) curves upward just below $0.12. Think of it as a long-term moving trendline that acts as a ceiling until broken. (In simple terms: the 50 SMA tracks average prices over 50 weeks, smoothing out short-term noise.) Horizontal Resistance: Historical price action shows that $0.12 aligns with multiple rejection zones, making it a psychological and technical barrier. Why It Matters: Breaking above this confluence could lead to a rapid climb to $0.17 (next resistance) and beyond, as historical supply zones diminish. 1D Chart: Preparing for Lift-Off On the daily chart, OPUL has reclaimed the 200-day SMA ($0.09) for the first time in over a year—a textbook bullish signal. Volume, while still subdued, shows signs of rising, and the chart suggests a potential Golden Cross (when the 50D SMA crosses above the 200D SMA—a classic bullish formation). Key observations: Rejection Zone at $0.39: This level, the upper border of a 2.5-year accumulation range, rejected March’s rally, marking it as a critical take-profit target for long-term bulls. Golden Cross Alert: Expected in December if momentum holds. Strategies: Entering the Dark Horse Breakout Above $0.12 Why: A confirmed daily or weekly close above $0.12 validates the bullish trend, opening the door to $0.17 and beyond. Stop Loss: $0.11 (tight for breakout traders). Take Profit: $0.17 (initial resistance), $0.39 (long-term resistance). $0.09-$0.07 Accumulation Zone Why: Confluence of dynamic support (200 SMA on daily) and historical horizontal support. Stop Loss: $0.065 (below the 2.5-year accumulation range). Take Profit: $0.12-$0.17. Absolute Bottoms: $0.05 Zone Why: Final support level based on multiple retests during the bear market. Ideal for stink orders. Stop Loss: below $0.04. Take Profit: $0.09, $0.17, $0.39. Long-Term Targets: Moonshots and Reality Realistic Goals (2024): $0.17 (early 2023 resistance). $0.39 (March’s rejection zone). $1.00-$1.25 (historical key levels). Ultra-Optimistic Goals (2025): $3.50 (5x market cap). $7.67 (ATH from 2021 bull run). Risk vs. Reward: A breakout above $0.12 significantly reduces downside risk, but the low liquidity and small market cap could amplify volatility. Stick to a strategy and avoid emotional decisions. Summary: A Hidden Gem with Tremendous Potential Opulous represents the kind of opportunity that comes along rarely: a niche project with strong fundamentals, undervalued in market cap, and ripe for a breakout. However, patience is key. The $0.12 resistance zone remains a pivotal battleground, and a breakout will likely define the next leg of its journey. For now, keep an eye on volume, monitor the charts, and always respect stop-loss levels. As the final installment of our AI trilogy, Opulous stands out not just as a coin but as a story waiting to unfold. Small in size, colossal in potential—this dark horse could lead the race if the market aligns. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Sheikh Musk (SHEMUSK), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHEMUSK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Sheikh Musk can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Sheikh Musk could become the next viral memecoin. Sheikh Musk launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Sheikh Musk on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Sheikh Musk by entering its contract address – 2jw2gXJaYUG5qJTwiPjjuTdsopJBdRVoBaPgMZ8ucHRr – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum.

From explosive presale performances to quirky tokens making headlines, meme coins are proving to be a gateway for crypto enthusiasts looking for quick wins. If you’re scouting for the best new meme coins to buy and hold for short-term gains, you’ve hit the jackpot. Today, we’ll be diving into three rising stars in the meme coin universe: BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Snek. First up, let’s talk about BTFD Coin , the current darling of the crypto community. This coin has been making waves with its presale performance, crossing impressive milestones at lightning speed. With over $400,000 raised and 10 billion coins sold so far, BTFD Coin has captured the hearts (and wallets) of investors globally. But hold on—Notcoin and Snek are no slouches either. Both of these tokens bring unique vibes to the table, offering exciting opportunities for those seeking fast returns. So, grab your popcorn and let’s break down why these three coins are the best new meme coins to buy and hold for short-term gains. BTFD Coin: Short-Term Gains with Long-Term Potential Let’s kick off with BTFD Coin, a meme coin that’s redefining how investors approach crypto dips. Short for Buy The Dip, BTFD Coin is all about encouraging investors to turn market downturns into profit opportunities. Its community-driven ethos, combined with a highly anticipated P2E game and staking rewards, makes it a powerhouse for short-term gains. As of its current presale stage (Stage 5), BTFD Coin is priced at $0.00005, with over $400,000 raised and 10 billion coins already snapped up by eager investors. This kind of performance screams potential. The presale has been smashing records, and analysts are buzzing about its likely price jump once it hits exchanges. Projections suggest it could debut at $0.0006—a significant leap from its presale price. Here’s the exciting part: if you invest $1,000 in the presale at $0.00005, you’d bag 20 million BTFD Coins. When the price rises to $0.0006, your investment would be worth a jaw-dropping $12,000. That’s the kind of short-term gain that makes meme coins irresistible. But BTFD Coin isn’t just about quick profits. Its ecosystem, complete with staking options offering an average APY of 90%, promises ongoing rewards for holders.

Its ability to balance short-term gains with user engagement is what makes it a top contender in the meme coin space. Snek: Slithering Its Way to Short-Term Success Last but certainly not least, we have Snek, a meme coin that’s equal parts charm and ambition. Inspired by the classic snake game, Snek is bringing retro vibes to the modern crypto scene. Its gamified ecosystem has captured the attention of gamers and crypto enthusiasts alike, making it a hot pick for short-term profits.

Most likely, it’s Ethereum. It’s the leader in smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), and it’s constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in the blockchain space. But that’s not all. VeChain, a blockchain project focused on supply chain management, is quickly growing in prominence, solving real-world problems and building trust with enterprises globally. Both Ethereum and VeChain have made huge strides in the crypto world and continue to be some of the best crypto to invest in due to their established use cases and long-term potential. But wait—what if we told you that Qubetics is emerging as a major player, too? With its unique approach to blockchain technology, Qubetics is catching the eyes of investors. The project has just raised $3.9 million in its presale, and with over 5300 holders, it’s gaining serious momentum. Analysts are predicting that Qubetics could hit a price range of $10-15 after the mainnet launch, making it one of the best crypto to invest in for the future. Its QubeQode IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is set to revolutionize how developers interact with blockchain, giving them a platform to build and deploy decentralized applications seamlessly. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Blockchain with QubeQode IDE Qubetics isn’t your typical crypto project. While many focus solely on tokenomics or decentralized finance (DeFi), Qubetics is tackling the developer experience head-on. Its QubeQode IDE is a game-changer for the crypto world. Developers will have access to an all-in-one environment to build, test, and deploy decentralized applications (dApps) without the usual complexity. This makes it easier for both new and experienced developers to jump into the blockchain ecosystem. With Qubetics providing an intuitive platform, blockchain development becomes less intimidating, enabling more innovation in the space. What’s even more exciting? Qubetics’ presale numbers are through the roof. They’ve raised $3.9 million so far, with over 5300 holders and 251 million tokens sold in Phase 10. And at just $0.025 per token, there’s still an opportunity to get in early before Qubetics hits the big time. Analysts are predicting that once the mainnet launches, the price could soar to anywhere between $10-15 per token. With such a promising future and a unique offering in QubeQode, Qubetics is definitely one of the best crypto to invest in today. Ethereum: Still Leading the Charge When it comes to smart contracts, Ethereum is still the king. Its massive network and developer base make it the go-to platform for decentralized applications (dApps). The Ethereum ecosystem is vast and includes everything from DeFi to NFTs. And with the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, Ethereum is transitioning to a more sustainable proof-of-stake model, which only increases its long-term viability. The network’s dominance in the blockchain space makes it one of the best crypto to invest in today, and it’s not showing signs of slowing down anytime soon. Ethereum’s strong presence in the DeFi space, its network of decentralized applications, and its partnerships with major companies all contribute to its continued success. If you’re looking for a safe bet in the world of crypto, Ethereum should definitely be on your radar. While there are other blockchains trying to compete, Ethereum’s ecosystem is tough to beat. For those seeking solid growth, Ethereum remains a leader in the market. VeChain: Supply Chain Management on Blockchain VeChain’s focus is on improving supply chain management through blockchain technology. By providing solutions for tracking products and ensuring transparency, VeChain is helping companies improve efficiency and reduce fraud. With a strong real-world use case, VeChain has partnered with major companies and governments worldwide to improve the traceability of goods and services. This makes VeChain a standout project in the blockchain space and one of the best crypto to invest in if you’re looking for something with tangible use in the supply chain sector. VeChain’s business model is based on providing blockchain solutions to industries, particularly in the supply chain. The network offers a platform for secure data sharing and tracking, which enhances transparency and reduces errors in the supply chain. As more industries look for ways to streamline their operations and reduce fraud, VeChain’s technology could become even more essential. For investors who are interested in a blockchain project with practical applications, VeChain is certainly worth considering. Conclusion While Ethereum and VeChain continue to make strides in their respective spaces, Qubetics offers something different—and perhaps even more exciting for future growth. The combination of a presale that’s already raised $3.5 million, a rapidly growing community, and analysts predicting a price surge to $10-15 after the mainnet launch, makes Qubetics one of the best crypto to invest in for 2024 and beyond. Its QubeQode IDE and tokenized marketplace are set to make a real impact on the blockchain world, attracting developers and businesses alike. With a promising future and innovative solutions for blockchain development, Qubetics is not just another project—it’s a movement. If you’re looking to diversify your crypto portfolio, Qubetics could be the perfect addition. With its impressive presale success and unique approach, it might just be the best crypto to invest in right now. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to get in early!

Want to know where the real opportunities are hiding in 2024? Well, look no further because Qubetics, Cronos, and Hedera are currently paving the way for some of the most promising investments in the market. Whether it’s Qubetics’ groundbreaking non-custodial wallet, Cronos’ ecosystem expansion, or Hedera’s role in scaling decentralized finance, these three cryptos have the potential to change the game. So, let’s dive into why they should be on your radar right now and why Qubetics is gearing up for an explosive post-mainnet launch. Qubetics: The Future of Crypto Wallets When we talk about the best cryptos to buy now, we can’t ignore Qubetics, especially with its innovative approach to blockchain technology. Qubetics is redefining the way we interact with digital assets, and it all begins with its non-custodial wallet. Now, you might be wondering, “What makes a non-custodial wallet so important?” Well, for starters, it gives users full control over their funds. No longer do you need to worry about relying on a third-party service to store your crypto. In a world where security risks are higher than ever, Qubetics offers a solution that puts privacy and control back into the hands of the users. The Qubetics wallet stands out because it’s designed to be user-friendly, even for those new to the crypto world. Unlike traditional wallets that can be complicated and require technical expertise, Qubetics offers an intuitive experience that allows anyone — from beginners to experts — to manage their digital assets securely. Whether you’re storing tokens, interacting with smart contracts, or participating in DeFi applications, the wallet makes it easy to do it all with a few clicks. This simple but powerful tool is likely to be a game-changer in how we approach blockchain and digital finance. But that’s just the beginning for Qubetics. The project is currently in its presale phase, raising an impressive $3.9 million and selling over 251 million tokens. Priced at just $0.025 per token during presale, analysts predict that the value of $TICS could soar to anywhere between $10 and $15 after its mainnet launch. That means if you get in now, you could be looking at incredible ROI once Qubetics hits the mainstream. With its innovative wallet and upcoming developments, Qubetics is poised for explosive growth, and now could be the perfect time to add this gem to your portfolio. Cronos: A Bridge Between Traditional Finance and DeFi Next up, let’s talk about Cronos, a blockchain that’s been making serious strides in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Cronos is a smart contract platform that focuses on creating an ecosystem that connects traditional finance with blockchain technology. What makes Cronos stand out is its unique positioning within the crypto space: it’s part of the Crypto.com family, which provides it with an established user base and access to millions of users worldwide. With its focus on scalability, interoperability, and security, Cronos is fast becoming a top choice for developers looking to build decentralized applications (dApps). One of Cronos’ most attractive features is its ability to offer fast transactions and low fees. In a space where transaction speed and costs can make or break a project, Cronos delivers on both fronts. This makes it an appealing choice for anyone looking to build on Ethereum but without the high gas fees that often come with it. Plus, Cronos is focused on bridging different blockchain ecosystems, making it easier for developers and users alike to move assets across different networks. If you’re someone looking for a project that’s scalable and has a strong community, Cronos might just be your ticket. Despite its promising tech and growing adoption, Cronos faces stiff competition in the DeFi space from giants like Ethereum and Solana. However, its close ties with Crypto.com give it a unique advantage, especially in terms of mainstream adoption and user accessibility. If you’re looking for a project that is building a powerful infrastructure for the future of decentralized finance, Cronos is certainly one to keep an eye on. Conclusion: The Future of Crypto Is Bright — Get In Now As we’ve seen, Qubetics, Cronos, and Hedera are three projects that have all the right ingredients to succeed in the evolving world of blockchain technology. Whether you’re drawn to Qubetics’ non-custodial wallet, Cronos’ DeFi ecosystem, or Hedera’s enterprise-ready scalability, these cryptos are positioning themselves for long-term growth. But if you’re looking for a project with explosive potential, Qubetics is the one to watch. With its presale raising millions and a future price prediction of $10-$15 per $TICS token after the mainnet launch, it’s clear that Qubetics is poised to be a major player in the crypto space. Add this to your portfolio now, and you could be looking at some seriously impressive returns in the near future. So, what are you waiting for? The best cryptos to invest in now are right in front of you. Don’t miss out on the opportunity to be part of the future of digital finance with Qubetics, Cronos, and Hedera.

Executive Chairman of MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor, presented Bitcoin strategic reserve for Microsoft (MSFT) boards on Dec. 01 as he promised earlier . He highlighted that Bitcoin is a transformation of digital capital, and they need to adopt Bitcoin as part of their balance sheet in the next few years. Bitcoin is projected to be one of the biggest assets in the world and account for $280 trillion of global wealth, which exceeds gold and art by the next 20 years with $45 trillion and $110 trillion, respectively. Saylor also noted that Microsoft clearly needed to be powered by digital capital as the price movement of Bitcoin outperformed Microsoft shares by 12 times annually. MicroStrategy (MSTR) shares also jumped to 3,045% after acquiring Bitcoin in the past few years, while MSFT only performed 103%. “Bitcoin is the best asset that you can own. The number’s speaks for themselves. It is make alot more sense to buy Bitcoin than buy your own stock back, or to hold Bitcoin rather than holding bonds. If you wanted to outperform you gotta need Bitcoin,” Saylor mention on his presentation posted on YouTube. Political and market support, which is represented by Trump’s administration and Bitcoin ETF’s products in the stock market, will also make Bitcoin massively adopted in the next few years, so Microsoft has, too.

These digital assets have garnered attention for different reasons, from Dogecoin’s meme-driven popularity to XRP’s robust utility in cross-border transactions and PropiChain’s innovative approach to real estate investment. As investors seek the next big opportunity, the question arises: Which of these altcoins will soon create the most millionaires? Dogecoin Price Surge: Excitement or Overhype? The Dogecoin price is again making waves in the crypto world, surging to a live price of $0.3933 with an impressive 24-hour trading volume of $11.45 billion. This momentum, fueled by a remarkable 169.64% increase in the last 30 days, has cemented DOGE’s position as the #7 cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at $57.77 billion. While the Dogecoin price rise is undeniably captivating, its foundation remains tied to external factors like the influence of Elon Musk’s tweets. This dependency makes DOGE a volatile investment. Without robust utility or innovation underpinning its growth, Dogecoin price faces challenges in maintaining its long-term appeal for serious investors. Legal Optimism Fuels a Record-Breaking XRP Price Rally The XRP price has surged an astonishing 218.68% since November 5, marking a remarkable rebound from its early November price of $0.51343. Currently trading at $1.67, XRP price is just 14% shy of its 2021 peak, with analysts setting their sights on a bold target of $4.20. This rally is underpinned by bullish technical indicators, particularly a golden cross, a rare alignment of the 50-day and 200-day SMAs on weekly charts. Historically, such signals have preceded the XRP price all-time highs, intensifying excitement among investors. Regulatory optimism and institutional adoption drive the XRP price growth, with trading volume at $8.4 billion. As Ripple’s SEC battle nears resolution, XRP price is poised to lead the crypto market and potentially achieve record-breaking performance. PCHAIN Beats Dogecoin Price and XRP Price PropiChain (PCHAIN) is poised to outperform the Dogecoin price and XRP price by revolutionizing the $300 trillion real estate market through blockchain and AI integration. Unlike Dogecoin’s meme-driven value and XRP’s regulatory challenges, PropiChain offers tangible utility by tokenizing real estate assets, enabling fractional ownership, and automating transactions via smart contracts. This approach democratizes property investment, providing stability and substantial growth potential. Analysts project that PropiChain could deliver returns up to 12,204%, surpassing the speculative gains of Dogecoin price and XRP price. PropiChain (PCHAIN): Revolutionizing Real Estate with Blockchain, AI, and NFTs PropiChain is reshaping the real estate space by combining blockchain, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and NFTs to address the inefficiencies of traditional property management. Built on a decentralized platform, PropiChain transforms real estate investment, ownership, and management into a simplified, secure, and globally accessible space. At its core, PropiChain leverages NFT tokenization to convert physical properties into digital assets. These NFTs represent ownership stakes, enabling fractional ownership where users can buy, sell, or trade portions of high-value properties. This democratization of real estate makes it accessible to a broader audience, eliminating barriers like exorbitant capital requirements and opaque pricing models. By tokenizing real estate, PropiChain brings liquidity to one of the most illiquid asset classes, allowing investors to diversify portfolios and easily trade their stakes. PropiChain’s integration of AI takes real estate management to new heights. The platform delivers real-time insights into property values, market trends, and investment opportunities through automated valuation models and predictive market analytics. Users can automate transactions based on specific conditions, optimizing strategies and minimizing risks. For instance, AI-powered tools can execute property purchases or sales automatically when predefined market criteria are met, ensuring efficiency and accuracy. PropiChain introduces the Propiverse, a metaverse-enabled feature that revolutionizes how investors explore and evaluate properties. Through immersive 3D virtual tours, users can interact with properties as if they were physically present. This eliminates geographical barriers and broadens investment opportunities. The PropiChain platform employs blockchain-based smart contracts to automate lease agreements, rental payments, and renewals. These contracts are tamper-proof and self-executing, ensuring transparency, reducing administrative burdens, and eliminating the need for intermediaries. Why Now Is the Best Time to Invest in PropiChain PropiChain’s presale offers a compelling opportunity for early investors, with the token currently priced at just $0.004. This low entry point is set to rise to $0.011 in stage two and climb even higher in later stages, rewarding those who act quickly with significant cost advantages. Early adopters benefit from discounted pricing and first-mover advantages, bolstered by PropiChain’s listing on CoinMarketCap and BlockAudit -certified security measures, which underscore its credibility. PropiChain outshines the Dogecoin price and XRP price by offering real-world utility and unmatched growth potential, making it the top choice for investors seeking high ROI and transformative opportunities. With the growing presale investments, now is the perfect time to seize this groundbreaking investment.

Trump Loves Russia (TRUMPRUS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPRUS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Loves Russia can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Loves Russia could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Loves Russia launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Loves Russia on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Loves Russia by entering its contract address – Qq41T28zPi8Wg7KWjeYMKkQPnUZ68ULvgWTEFpkaJXJ – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPRUS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 02:27:00

Lightchain AI , priced at just $0.07 during its presale, is emerging as a transformative force in blockchain innovation. With its unique integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and cutting-edge decentralized technology, experts believe Lightchain AI could redefine how industries leverage blockchain. Why Lightchain AI Is a Game-Changer Lightchain AI is not just another cryptocurrency—it’s a platform designed to solve real-world challenges while pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology. Its revolutionary features, including Proof of Intelligence (PoI) and the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) , set it apart from traditional blockchains. Key Innovations That Stand Out: Proof of Intelligence (PoI): Lightchain AI’s consensus mechanism rewards nodes for performing AI computations, such as machine learning and data analysis, making it eco-friendly and utility-driven. Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM): AIVM enables the seamless execution of AI tasks directly on the blockchain, offering industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics an advanced, decentralized solution.

The large-cap altcoin surged over 25 percent in the last 24 hours to trade about $2.4 on Monday, December 2, during the early Asian session. The utility-based altcoin, with a market cap of about $140 billion and a fully diluted valuation of over $240 billion, registered a 45 percent surge in daily average traded volume to about $23 billion at the time of this report. Why Did XRP Go Up? As Coinpedia previously noted, XRP price has significantly benefited from the election of pro-crypto leaders in the United States, led by President-elect Donald Trump. The long-standing legal hurdles emanating from the US SEC charges are likely to be dropped once a new SEC chair is confirmed early next year. The notable rise of XRP in the past 24 hours is partly attributed to the heavy liquidation of short traders. According to data from Coinglass, XRP’s leveraged market-led in liquidations during the past 24 hours of more than $50 million, with over $36 million involving short traders. Consequently, the odds of a short squeeze have significantly increased the ongoing XRP’s bullish outlook. 500,000,000 #XRP (945,196,977 USD) unlocked from escrow at unknown wallet https://t.co/BiPf94ED2q — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) December 1, 2024 In the last 24 hours, on-chain data shows a heightened activity of whale traders, led by Ripple. For instance, Ripple unlocked 1 billion XRP units from the escrow account and locked back over 800 million units. Meanwhile, several transactions involved whale investors withdrawing huge amounts of XRP from different exchanges led by Upbit and Binance . What Next For XRP Price? pic.twitter.com/1kuFxoWxM0 — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) December 1, 2024 Following a 280 percent surge in November, XRP price has officially broken out of a multi-year triangular consolidation. The veteran altcoin is now on the verge of retesting its all-time high (ATH), which was set in 2018 after surpassing its 2021 bull cycle peak. From a technical analysis standpoint, XRP price has entered its much anticipated parabolic phase, which could yield further gains in the coming months. Already, the weekly Relative Strength Index (RSI) has surged above the 85 percent level for the first time since 2021, signaling the bulls are in control.

It can be a tough choice with so many options out there. But if you’re keeping an eye on the right projects, some are starting to shine brighter than the rest. Solana and Fantom are two of the heavyweights that have been causing waves in the blockchain world. Solana’s blazing-fast transaction speeds and low costs make it a go-to for developers, while Fantom is becoming the favourite for DeFi enthusiasts with its lightning-fast and scalable platform. Both projects continue to grow and bring exciting new features to the space, proving why they’re often listed among the best crypto to invest in right now. However, there’s a new player in town that’s starting to make a serious splash—Qubetics. With its innovative Decentralised VPN (dVPN), Qubetics is carving out its own niche in the crypto world. Plus, with Qubetics currently in its presale phase, analysts predict a significant price surge to $10 to $15 after its mainnet launch. For anyone looking to get ahead of the curve, Qubetics could just be one of the best crypto to invest in right now. Solana: Speed and Efficiency for the Future When you’re talking about the best crypto to invest in, Solana is a name that you can’t ignore. Known for its incredibly fast transaction speeds, Solana has gained a strong following in the crypto community. This high-performance blockchain has been able to scale without compromising on decentralisation or security, which makes it stand out among its peers. Solana’s proof-of-history (PoH) consensus mechanism allows transactions to be processed at lightning speed, making it one of the most efficient platforms available. What’s exciting about Solana is its rapidly expanding ecosystem. From DeFi platforms to NFTs, the network is seeing more and more developers flocking to it due to its low transaction costs and high throughput. Solana’s growing popularity and adoption continue to drive its price upward, which makes it a solid choice if you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in today. And with the network’s constant development, Solana is set to remain a key player in the crypto space for the foreseeable future. Fantom: Fast, Scalable, and Ready for DeFi Fantom is another rising star in the world of crypto. If you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in for the long term, Fantom should definitely be on your radar. This blockchain platform offers quick, secure transactions, thanks to its unique consensus mechanism, Lachesis. Fantom’s low transaction fees and high throughput make it perfect for building decentralised finance (DeFi) applications. And as the DeFi space continues to grow, Fantom is positioning itself as a go-to platform for developers. What sets Fantom apart is its ability to interoperate with other blockchains, especially Ethereum. This means developers can use Fantom to build dApps that are easily integrated with other networks, making it more versatile than many other blockchain platforms. Fantom’s fast-growing ecosystem and focus on decentralisation make it a great contender for the best crypto to invest in right now, and its performance over the last year shows just how much potential it holds for the future. Qubetics: The Future of Decentralised VPN and Security Qubetics is focusing on an area that’s quickly becoming a hot topic—privacy and security. With its Decentralised VPN (dVPN), Qubetics is offering a solution to one of the biggest issues on the internet today: data security. Traditional VPNs come with their own set of problems, from data storage risks to reliance on centralised service providers. Qubetics aims to solve these issues by offering a fully decentralised alternative that puts users back in control of their data. What makes Qubetics particularly appealing is that it’s not just a privacy-focused project, it’s also a tech powerhouse. With the launch of the QubeQode IDE, Qubetics is creating an ecosystem where developers can build and deploy decentralised applications (dApps) in a secure, private, and efficient manner. This will drive more innovation within the decentralised space, bringing more use cases for Qubetics’ token. Analysts predict that the price of Qubetics could surge to $10-$15 after the mainnet launch, making it one of the best crypto to invest in today if you’re looking to get in on the ground floor of a truly disruptive project. With its presale already raising millions and attracting thousands of investors, Qubetics is showing all the signs of a major player in the crypto world. The project’s commitment to security, privacy, and decentralisation is resonating with users and investors alike, and with more features like the QubeQode IDE in the pipeline, it’s only a matter of time before Qubetics becomes a household name in the blockchain space. Conclusion While Solana and Fantom continue to impress with their speed, scalability, and growing ecosystems, Qubetics brings a fresh approach by focusing on privacy and decentralisation. The project’s dVPN offering is filling a much-needed gap in the market, while its upcoming mainnet launch has analysts predicting significant price growth. If you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in today , Qubetics could be the project that not only keeps you ahead of the curve but also delivers substantial returns in the future. With its presale generating excitement and a clear roadmap ahead, Qubetics is definitely worth keeping an eye on. So, if you’re ready to get in early on a project that’s set to revolutionise the world of decentralised internet security, Qubetics might just be the best crypto to invest in right now. Don’t miss out on this exciting opportunity—join the presale and get ready for the future of blockchain technology!

ETH is showing bullish signs and might soon aim for a move above the $3,800 resistance zone. Ethereum started a decent increase from the $3,550 zone. The price is trading above $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,700 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could restart its increase if it clears the $3,750 zone. Ethereum Price Eyes Steady Increase Ethereum price remained supported above $3,350 and started a fresh increase like Bitcoin . ETH was able to surpass the $3,450 and $3,550 resistance levels. The bulls pumped the price above the $3,700 level. A high was formed at $3,748 and the price is now consolidating gains. There was a minor decline below the $3,720 level. The price dipped and tested the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $3,572 swing low to the $3,748 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,550 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $3,700 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,740 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,750 level. The main resistance is now forming near $3,800. A clear move above the $3,800 resistance might send the price toward the $3,880 resistance. An upside break above the $3,880 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,940 resistance zone or even $4,000. Downside Correction In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,750 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,700 level. The first major support sits near the $3,675 zone. A clear move below the $3,675 support might push the price toward the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward wave from the $3,572 swing low to the $3,748 high at $3,640. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,570 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $3,550.

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 03:57:00

The 364% XRP rally in November calls for a new all-time high beyond $4.3. XRP Price to New All-Time High? The XRP Price could be making a move to its new all-time high in December itself. The third-largest altcoin has achieved a significant milestone, breaking out of 84 months of stagnant price action with a single explosive XRP monthly candle . This dramatic move marks a turning point for the cryptocurrency, potentially signaling the start of a new trend after years of consolidation. Veteran trader Peter Brandt shares a classic breakout from a flag-and-pole pattern on a multi-year timeframe. Source: Peter Brandt With more than 75% weekly gains, XRP is dominating the entire altcoin space outperforming other giants like Ethereum. As a result, crypto market experts are once again stressing the need to have a spot XRP ETF in the market. Three major firms—Bitwise, Canary, and 21Shares—have filed applications for spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), targeting the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Nate Geraci, the President of ETH Store believes that additional issuers are likely to join the race, with the growing interest in XRP-based investment products. Pro-XRP lawyer Jeremy Hogan believes that a spot XRP ETF could come by mid-2025. There are currently 3 filings for ETFs holding what is now the 3rd largest crypto asset by market cap… Bitwise, Canary, & 21Shares have all filed for spot XRP ETFs. Guessing addn’l issuers will jump in here. — Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) December 2, 2024 As of press time, the XRP price is trading 27% up at $2.40 with a market cap of $136 billion. The Coinglass data shows that the XRP open interest has surged 28.67% moving all the way to $4.21 billion. Also, the 24-hour liquidations have shot up to $53 million with $38 million in short liquidations and over $14 million in long liquidations. Some market analysts believe that the XRP is eyeing the next leg of the rally to $4.3. A Walk Down the Memory Lane When XRP Dominated Solana, USDT The XRP price rally helped it overtake Tether (USDT) to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, marking a return to its pre-SEC lawsuit position. Historically, XRP held the second spot behind Bitcoin (BTC) until the SEC’s 2018 Hinman speech, which classified Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) as non-securities under the “sufficiently decentralized” framework. Back then it was trading much above other rivals like Solana, USDT, BNB Coin, etc. Ethereum’s market cap surpassed XRP’s in November 2018, reshaping the crypto rankings. XRP’s recent surge now revives its position among the top-tier cryptocurrencies. In December 2020, the US SEC lawsuit against Ripple caused XRP’s price to plummet from around $0.50 to $0.17, wiping out over $15 billion in market value. Although the price eventually recovered, XRP remained at the 7 spot for the next four years. XRP Lawyer John Deaton provides a complete overview of how XRP was the go-to cryptocurrency for businesses while the XRP Ledger was the most preferred platform for instant cross-border settlement. Talking about his long-going battle with the US SEC in the Ripple lawsuit, Deaton wrote: “I sued the SEC b/c what it did was wrong. I’m not talking about Ripple. The SEC sues lots of companies. I’m talking about the absurd allegation that XRP itself was illegal, including if acquired by USERS of the XRPL or by people who’d never heard of Brad Garlinghouse, Chris Larsen, or Ripple”. Below is a complete timeline of how Ripple’s XRP gained prominence in the early days before facing the regulatory heat in 2020. THE RETURN OF XRP With XRP overtaking SOL, above $2, and approaching a $120B market cap, allow me to reflect. When I sued the SEC, people assumed I was a huge XRP holder. The truth is, when the @Ripple case was filed, 50% of my net worth was in BTC. Today, it’s 80%.

Bitcoin’s price keeps flirting with new highs, Ethereum’s updates promise to reshape decentralised finance, and rising stars like Qubetics ($TICS) are turning heads with their unique offerings and explosive growth potential. While volatility is the name of the game, it’s also what makes crypto such an exciting space for high-return investments. Among the standout players, Qubetics is making waves for all the right reasons. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics isn’t just another cryptocurrency—it’s solving problems that other blockchains have struggled to address. With applications like decentralised VPNs and a record-breaking presale, $TICS is a name that keeps popping up in discussions about the best cryptos to invest in 2024. Let’s break down what makes these five coins top contenders for your portfolio this year. 1. Qubetics ($TICS): Qubetics has set out to unify the blockchain universe, and it’s doing so with game-changing features. One of its standout applications is its decentralised VPN, a privacy-focused tool that not only secures internet connections but also incentivises users by rewarding them with $TICS tokens for sharing unused bandwidth. It’s a win-win for businesses and individuals alike. Picture this: a small business running sensitive transactions across various locations. With Qubetics’ dVPN, data breaches have become a thing of the past. Or imagine an avid gamer who wants a lag-free experience while ensuring their data isn’t being sold to third parties. Qubetics offers a seamless solution, proving its real-world value. The numbers don’t lie. Qubetics’ presale is currently in its 10th stage, with over 251 million tokens sold to more than 5,300 holders, raising $3.9 million. At $0.025 per token, analysts predict mind-blowing returns, with $TICS potentially hitting $15 post-mainnet launch. A $1,000 investment today buys 40,000 tokens. By the presale’s end at $0.25, that’s $10,000. If the price reaches $15, it skyrockets to $600,000. Why did this coin make it to this list? Qubetics isn’t just about profits; it’s about solving real-world problems while creating opportunities for unprecedented growth. 2. Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin remains the gold standard in crypto. As the first and most recognised cryptocurrency, Bitcoin’s dominance is unmatched. But as much as it’s hailed as “digital gold,” its use cases are limited by slow transaction speeds and high fees. Despite this, Bitcoin’s value proposition as a store of value continues to attract institutional investors. Recently, Bitcoin has been making headlines as its price stabilises above $37,000. Analysts predict that a bull market could push BTC back to its previous highs of $60,000 or even beyond. For investors looking for stability in an otherwise volatile market, Bitcoin remains a solid pick. Think about it: a $1,000 investment in Bitcoin at its current price secures about 0.027 BTC. If Bitcoin reaches $60,000, that investment becomes $1,620. Not bad for a low-risk addition to your portfolio, though it pales in comparison to the ROI potential of newer players like Qubetics. Why did this coin make it to this list? Bitcoin’s reliability and market dominance make it a cornerstone for any diversified crypto portfolio. 3. Ethereum (ETH): Ethereum isn’t just a cryptocurrency; it’s an entire ecosystem powering decentralised finance (DeFi), NFTs, and smart contracts. With its recent shift to a proof-of-stake model, Ethereum is also becoming more energy-efficient, addressing one of its biggest criticisms. Ethereum’s latest upgrade, known as the “Shanghai update,” is expected to enhance scalability and lower transaction costs. These improvements are crucial for DeFi platforms and dApps, which rely on Ethereum’s infrastructure. Imagine a startup building a lending platform that connects borrowers and lenders without banks. Ethereum makes it possible. Currently priced around $1,800, Ethereum is projected to reach $3,000 by the end of 2024. A $1,000 investment today buys about 0.55 ETH. If the price hits $3,000, that investment grows to $1,650. While it’s not as flashy as Qubetics’ projections, Ethereum’s proven track record makes it a safe bet. Why did this coin make it to this list? Ethereum’s dominance in DeFi and its role as the backbone of blockchain innovation make it indispensable. 4. Solana (SOL): Solana has earned a reputation as one of the fastest blockchains in the world, with transaction speeds clocking in at 65,000 transactions per second. It’s a developer’s dream, enabling the creation of dApps and DeFi platforms without the bottlenecks seen on Ethereum. Recent developments include Solana’s growing NFT ecosystem and its focus on gaming applications. For example, imagine a gaming platform where players can trade in-game assets instantly and with minimal fees. Solana’s speed and low costs make this a reality. SOL is currently priced around $35, with analysts predicting it could hit $80 in 2024. A $1,000 investment secures about 28.57 SOL. If the price reaches $80, that investment grows to $2,286. It’s not the explosive growth of Qubetics, but Solana’s focus on speed and scalability ensures it remains a top contender. Why did this coin make it to this list? Solana’s unmatched speed and low costs make it a go-to for developers and investors alike. 5. Cardano (ADA) Cardano takes a methodical approach to blockchain development, using peer-reviewed research to inform its upgrades. Its Hydra scaling solution promises to make Cardano one of the most scalable platforms, capable of handling microtransactions and enterprise-level applications. For instance, imagine a global non-profit using Cardano to distribute aid transparently and efficiently. Its scalability and focus on sustainability make it a compelling choice for real-world applications. Currently priced at $0.26, ADA is projected to reach $0.50 in 2024. A $1,000 investment buys about 3,846 ADA tokens. If the price doubles to $0.50, that investment becomes $1,923. While the returns aren’t as eye-popping as those of Qubetics, Cardano’s long-term vision and steady growth make it a strong candidate. Why did this coin make it to this list? Cardano’s focus on sustainability and real-world applications ensures its relevance in an evolving market. Conclusion: Choosing the Best Cryptos to Invest When it comes to the best cryptos to invest in 2024, each coin on this list brings something unique to the table. Bitcoin offers stability, Ethereum powers innovation, Solana delivers speed, and Cardano provides a sustainable vision. But Qubetics stands out for its ability to solve real-world problems while offering explosive ROI potential. With its presale nearing a price hike, now’s the perfect time to secure $TICS tokens and position yourself for incredible returns. Don’t miss out—the future of crypto is here, and it’s called Qubetics.

The price even meteorically increases by 365% from $0.51 in the past month, making them the top gainers along with Peanut (PNUT), Stellar (XLM), and Hedera (HBAR). The price movement also made XRP’s market capitalization as the third largest in the world after surging 26% to $136 billion, surpassing Tether ( USDT ) and Solana ( SOL ) with $134 billion and $108 billion, respectively. 1 Day XRP price chart, September 08 – December 02, 2024 | Source: crypto.news The tokens were also actively traded for about $26.41 billion, or an increase of 75% in a day. Earlier last week, XRP had already flipped Binance’s BNB after they reached $97 billion in market cap, while BNB was still on their $95 billion. Ripple’s business expansion and market optimism pushed the price movement and headed to the all-time high record of $3.8 that was reached 7 years ago.

Meanwhile, analysts are sounding alarms about the potential volatility surrounding XRP, especially in light of its recent surge to multi-year highs. XRP Surges to 2021 Highs Amid Leverage Concerns and Market Buzz Ripple’s native token, XRP , has seen an explosive rally, with its price reaching levels not witnessed since 2021. However, analysts warn the surge may be ”leverage-driven,” cautioning traders about potential volatility as open interest in XRP derivatives reaches record levels. In a Dec. 1 post on X, CryptoQuant analyst Maarten Regterschot sounded the alarm on XRP’s open interest, which saw a massive 37% spike in just 24 hours. Open interest measures the total number of active derivatives contracts, such as futures and options, and its sudden increase often precedes heightened price volatility. “Open Interest is up 37% already — watch for volatility. The last similar event led to a -17% drawdown,” Maarten warned. “Stay sharp, manage risk accordingly.” CoinGlass data corroborates Maarten’s analysis, showing that XRP’s open interest has climbed 30% in the past day to reach $4 billion across major exchanges. Such a sharp increase often signals that traders are leveraging positions to capitalize on the rally, but it also raises the risk of sudden sell-offs. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.39, marking a staggering 68% gain over the past month. The token’s performance has been particularly strong in the past week, during which it soared nearly 70%. Year-to-date, XRP has posted an eye-popping 370% increase, significantly outperforming most other major cryptocurrencies. The rally comes on the heels of bullish sentiment sweeping the crypto markets following Donald Trump’s election victory on Nov. 6. While Bitcoin and Solana also posted significant gains, XRP has been a standout performer, driven by a confluence of factors. On Dec. 1, XRP surpassed Solana in market capitalization and has since leapfrogged Tether, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency by total value. Its market cap now sits behind only Bitcoin and Ethereum. The token’s outsized performance has been attributed to a variety of catalysts, including Ripple Labs’ strategic partnerships, new product rollouts, and growing speculation about an XRP-focused exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). Several developments have bolstered investor confidence in XRP: Ripple’s Key PartnershipsRipple Labs has secured a series of high-profile partnerships aimed at expanding the use of XRP for cross-border payments. These collaborations have strengthened the token’s utility and reinforced its value proposition. XRP ETF SpeculationOn Nov. 1, 2024, asset manager 21Shares filed for an XRP ETF, fueling expectations that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could approve the application. Optimism has also grown amid reports of likely leadership changes at the SEC in January 2025, which could usher in a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Rumors of Elon Musk’s InvolvementUnverified reports suggesting that Elon Musk may invest heavily in XRP and Ripple have further amplified market excitement. While these rumors remain speculative, they have contributed to the token’s bullish momentum. Analysts Urge Caution Despite the euphoria, analysts like Maarten are urging caution, emphasizing the risks associated with a leverage-driven rally. Historical patterns suggest that rapid increases in open interest often lead to abrupt market corrections. The last time XRP experienced a similar spike, the price saw a sharp 17% decline shortly afterward. Traders are advised to monitor market conditions closely and manage their risk exposure. The combination of leverage, speculative activity, and heightened volatility could lead to significant price swings in the short term. With XRP’s price hitting new multi-year highs, its market performance will remain under close scrutiny. Key developments to watch include the SEC’s decision on XRP ETF applications, the validity of rumors surrounding Musk’s involvement, and Ripple Labs’ continued efforts to expand the token’s adoption. The crypto community is divided between those celebrating XRP’s resurgence and those wary of the risks posed by leverage and speculation. As the narrative unfolds, XRP’s trajectory could set the tone for broader market dynamics heading into 2025. Ripple CTO David Schwartz Condemns Operation Chokepoint 2.0, Citing Threats to Civil Liberties In a related development, Ripple’s Chief Technical Officer, David Schwartz, has joined the growing chorus of tech leaders denouncing Operation Chokepoint 2.0—a purported government initiative targeting the crypto industry through debanking. Schwartz criticized the operation for undermining the rule of law and threatening fundamental civil liberties, while urging regulators to adopt transparent and lawful processes. In a recent statement, Schwartz accused the government of being ”addicted to indirect regulation,” using debanking as a tool to suppress industries without following due legal processes. He identified four critical ways in which debanking undermines civil liberties: Evasion of Surveillance and SanctionsSchwartz argued that debanked entities often resort to switching service providers or taking their funds underground. This not only limits governmental oversight but also reduces the effectiveness of sanctions enforcement. Violation of Due ProcessBy pressuring financial institutions to cut ties with certain businesses, the government circumvents the judicial process, effectively punishing entities without formally charging them with a crime. Infringement on Free SpeechSchwartz linked debanking to restrictions on freedom of speech, noting that financial exclusion can stifle dissenting voices and disfavored industries. Encroachment on Privacy RightsThe CTO criticized the practice for enabling what he described as unlawful search and seizure, with banks being pressured to act as extensions of regulatory agencies. “Our government has become addicted to indirect regulation precisely because of these evils,” Schwartz stated. “It is cheaper and easier to pressure someone else to punish me than to charge me with a crime and give me due process.” He implored regulators to abandon covert tactics in favor of lawful and transparent mechanisms, adding, “It is easier to pressure banks to cut off disfavored businesses than to make that business illegal.” The Fallout from Operation Chokepoint 2.0 The crypto industry has faced significant challenges under what many executives describe as a coordinated effort to choke off financial access. Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz, claimed that more than 30 tech firms have been victims of the operation. Other prominent voices have shared similar experiences: Sam Kazemian (Frax Finance)The founder alleged that JPMorgan Chase debanked him in December 2022, reflecting a broader pattern of financial institutions severing ties with crypto firms. Brian Armstrong (Coinbase)Coinbase’s co-founder and CEO has formally requested records related to Operation Chokepoint 2.0 under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and is compiling evidence of what he describes as systemic debanking. Nic Carter (Castle Island Ventures)In September 2024, Carter accused the Biden administration of deliberately orchestrating the collapse of Silvergate Bank—a pivotal institution for the crypto sector. “I believe Silvergate could have survived its drawdown — and was on a path to do so,” Carter said. Schwartz’s remarks come amid growing scrutiny of government actions targeting the crypto sector. Industry stakeholders have expressed hope that the incoming Trump administration, set to take office in 2025, will reverse what many perceive as regulatory hostility. Optimism centers on the possibility of fostering a more balanced regulatory environment that encourages innovation while addressing legitimate concerns about financial stability and compliance. Industry insiders believe such a shift could restore confidence in the United States as a hub for blockchain and cryptocurrency development. While Operation Chokepoint 2.0 has caused significant disruption, the crypto industry remains resilient. Ripple’s David Schwartz and other industry leaders continue to advocate for fair and transparent regulations, underscoring the need to protect civil liberties while fostering technological progress. The debate over crypto regulation reflects broader tensions between innovation and oversight, with the outcome likely to shape the future of the digital economy.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-02 05:29:36

As Bitcoin (BTC) price failed to reach the much-hyped target of $100k in November, investors’ focus has gradually shifted to the altcoin industry in the recent past led by Ethereum (ETH), Ripple’s XRP, Hedera (HBAR), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Solana (SOL), among many others. Major Paradigm Shift in Investing Models According to Ki Young Ju, the founder and CEO at CryptoQuant, the ongoing altseason is no longer defined by crypto cash rotation from Bitcoin. Moreover, Bitcoin price has not registered notable cash outflows in the recent past to guarantee a significant spike in large-cap altcoins. Instead, Ju highlighted that the notable altcoin growth is majorly attributed to stablecoin and fiat pairs, which reflects real market growth rather than asset rotation.

While Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been a top performer in previous cycles, new data suggests a rising contender could outshine the popular meme coin. That token is Lightchain AI , a revolutionary blockchain project blending artificial intelligence with decentralized technology. With its innovative approach and growing ecosystem, Lightchain AI is positioned to redefine the market narrative. What Makes Lightchain AI a Stronger Contender Than SHIB? 1. Real-World Utility Over Memes While SHIB owes much of its success to community-driven hype and branding, Lightchain AI’s foundation lies in real-world applications. Its Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism incentivizes meaningful AI computations, enabling applications like machine learning, data analytics, and predictive modeling—all while maintaining scalability and sustainability. 2. Early-Stage Investment Potential SHIB has already experienced its meteoric rise, and while it remains a strong community-driven asset, Lightchain AI is in its presale phase , offering a rare chance to invest at a ground-floor price. Investors who recognized SHIB’s potential early saw life-changing gains, and Lightchain AI provides a similar opportunity for exponential growth. 3. Broader Market Appeal Lightchain AI’s dual focus appeals to a wider range of investors: Enterprise Solutions: Its Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) empowers businesses to leverage decentralized AI for critical tasks. Retail Speculators: Features like the upcoming meme coin pump pad position it as a unique platform for high-energy market movements. By catering to both institutional and retail audiences, Lightchain AI combines the best of utility and speculative potential. SHIB’s Strengths and Its Limitations SHIB has earned its place as a top meme coin, boasting a loyal community and expanding utility with its Shibarium Layer 2 solution. However, its value largely depends on speculative sentiment, and many investors are looking for tokens with more tangible use cases in the long term. Key Challenges for SHIB: Market Saturation: The meme coin space is increasingly crowded, making it harder for SHIB to maintain its dominance. Utility Limitations: While its ecosystem is growing, SHIB’s primary value driver remains community hype. Lightchain AI addresses these gaps by combining speculative appeal with technological innovation, offering a more robust investment case. Why Lightchain AI Could Dominate the Next Bull Run Technological Innovation No other project combines blockchain and AI as effectively as Lightchain AI. Its ability to perform AI-specific tasks on-chain opens doors to industries like healthcare, finance, and logistics, creating a vast market for its native token, LCAI. Massive Growth Potential Analysts predict that AI and blockchain integration will be a trillion-dollar market by 2030. By being an early mover in this space, Lightchain AI positions itself for unparalleled adoption and value appreciation. Presale Momentum Lightchain AI’s ongoing presale has already raised significant capital, reflecting strong investor confidence. As it transitions into mainstream trading, early adopters could see exponential returns. Should You Bet on Lightchain AI Over SHIB? While SHIB remains a fan favorite and could perform well in the next bull run, Lightchain AI offers a more compelling investment narrative. Its combination of cutting-edge technology, real-world applications, and early-stage pricing makes it a standout choice for investors seeking both short-term excitement and long-term value. Join the Lightchain AI Revolution With the next bull run on the horizon, there’s no better time to explore projects with the potential to redefine the crypto landscape. Lightchain AI is more than just a token—it’s a movement bridging AI and blockchain for the future. Don’t miss your chance to secure your place in this revolutionary project.

This marks a major milestone, bringing XRP back to where it was before Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC . Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett recently highlighted XRP’s challenges, noting it was once the second-largest cryptocurrency before the SEC’s 2018 Hinman speech. The speech classified Bitcoin and Ethereum as non-securities, causing XRP to lose its position to Ethereum by November 2018 due to regulatory uncertainty. Documents from the Ripple case, known as the “ Hinman emails ,” revealed internal SEC disagreements about the speech’s impact on other cryptocurrencies. Six years later, XRP’s regulatory status remains unclear, fueling ongoing debates on how cryptocurrencies should be classified. John Deaton’s Legal Battle for XRP’s Fairness Attorney John Deaton has been a key figure in XRP’s legal journey. Reflecting on his battle against the SEC, Deaton revealed that his initial XRP holdings were modest compared to his investments in Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the SEC’s claim that all XRP transactions were illegal motivated him to step up and defend not just Ripple but also XRP’s global users. Deaton highlighted key inconsistencies in the SEC’s actions. In 2014, the U.S. Government Accountability Office classified XRP as a virtual currency. In 2015, FinCEN declared XRP a currency and set compliance rules for Ripple. By 2019, Coinbase listed XRP after thorough legal reviews, and MoneyGram publicly disclosed using XRP in its business. Despite these validations, the SEC filed its lawsuit in December 2020, calling XRP an unregistered security and sending shockwaves through the crypto world. But it’s not just Deaton who supported XRP, the 75000 XRP army also made it possible and stayed strong in all phases of XRP. Many investors have doubled their holdings just to show their confidence in XRP. Amid the ongoing Ripple vs SEC battle, uncover what’s next for XRP—read XRP price prediction and see why analysts are bullish! XRP Price Surge XRP closed November with a whopping 3x rally, hitting a seven-year high. The crypto remained resilient despite releasing 1 billion tokens, which might concern newcomers unfamiliar with XRP’s tokenomics. After yesterday’s 2.4% dip, XRP has seen a 29% surge today and is currently trading at $2.44. As the new month begins, market watchers are eager to see how XRP performs amid increased trading volumes, suggesting the continuation of its recent momentum. Analysts are hopeful that XRP will see a massive jump in January after Gary Gensler steps down . FAQs What caused XRP’s recent price rally? XRP’s rally is fueled by legal updates, reduced regulatory uncertainty, and bullish technical breakouts driving a 3x gain in November. How does Ripple vs SEC affect XRP’s price? The Ripple vs SEC case has impacted XRP by creating legal uncertainty, but recent progress boosts investor confidence and price growth. How much will XRP be worth by the end of 2025?

The bullish sentiment peaking can be directly seen in the rising Bitcoin price. The cumulative digital assets market cap jumped marginally over the day to stand at $3.43 trillion. Its 24 hour trading volume spiked by 18% to hit the $181 billion mark. Analysts suggest that the Bitcoin balance of the crypto exchange is drying up amid high buying pressure. Ether ETFs attracted $466M last week According to reports , November 2024 saw Bitcoin ETFs attracting $6.5 billion in net inflows, while Ether ETFs garnered $1.1 billion. These figures represent all-time highs for both assets as crypto bulls took over after much anticipated Donald Trump’s US Presidential election win. With a Bitcoin surge , a climbing interest in Ether signals a growing speculative appetite for crypto. On Nov 29, nine Ether ETFs recorded a $333 million net inflow, with major players like BlackRock and Fidelity leading the charge. BlackRock’s ETHA has seen a cumulative inflow of $2.10 billion of inflow till now. Data provided by SosoValue shows that Ether ETFs pulled in over $466 million in the last week of November, while it saw an outflow of $71.60 million in the prior week. ETH price surged by 48% in the last 7 days. The biggest altcoin is trading at an average price of $3,691, at the press time. Bitcoin approached $100K in November but couldn’t make it through. However, Ether has outperformed Bitcoin since Trump’s election, though it has yet to hit new highs. BTC is trading at an average price of $96,892, at the press time. At the moment, XRP is printing huge green indexes as investors anticipate a reversal of the SEC crackdown. Some firms are already looking to launch XRP-focused ETFs. Trump has vowed to overhaul regulatory approaches, remove restrictions, and build more crypto-friendly policies. XRP price is up by 376% in the last 30 days. Ripple’s native crypto is trading at an average price of $2.44, at the press time. It is now the 3rd biggest crypto asset with a market cap of over $140 billion. Bitcoin balances on exchanges declining? Markus Thielen suggested in a post that Bitcoin balances on exchanges are rapidly decreasing, with no large inflows replenishing inventory as seen earlier this year. Only three exchanges—Bitfinex, Binance, and Coinbase currently have sufficient Bitcoin inventory, he added. Recent inflows into Bitcoin have been substantial which indicates that a bearish outlook is premature. Bitcoin is not only a topic at Thanksgiving dinners, but it’s also set to be a key discussion point during Christmas. He highlighted that the crypto market capitalization has now reached $3.43 trillion, with BTC’s dominance decreasing from 60% to 56%. This shift may signal the beginning of altcoin season, a phenomenon often driven by market sentiment. Since Trump’s election, the crypto market has seen a $1.2 trillion surge. This rally, building on the momentum of pro-crypto policies, is revitalizing the sector after the 2021 downturn.

Now, the cryptocurrency's price chart reveals a compelling pattern reminiscent of the set-up in bitcoin (BTC) before it chalked out a record rally last month. Ether's three-line break chart, which filters out day-to-day noise and erratic price movements, shows the cryptocurrency's eight-month corrective trend, characterized by lower highs and lower lows, has ended and the broader uptrend from the October 2023 lows near $1,500 has resumed. Such breakouts often trigger a bullish cascading effect on price by attracting new buyers and forcing out sellers that restricted price rallies during consolidation. Bitcoin witnessed a similar breakout in mid-October , signaling a rally to the then-record highs above $73,000. BTC has since surged 45% to over $96,000, according to data source TradingView and CoinDesk. While traders track price patterns to gauge trend strength and changes, they don't always work as intended and fundamental factors can single-handedly make or break trends. That said, the recent activity on the ethereum network supports the bullish case in ETH. The number of ""blobs"" posted on the Ethereum network by the layer 2 protocols surged in November. Posting blobs incurs fluctuating fees paid in ether, which are burned like regular transaction fees, taking out ETH's supply from the market. Meanwhile, mainstream investor interest in the token is rising. On Friday, the nine spot ether ETFs listed in the U.S. accumulated $332.9 million in inflows, the highest single tally since inception, according to Farside Investors .Read more: This Chart Indicates Bitcoin May Be Headed for Record Highs Above $73K",Markets|Bitcoin|Ether|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-02 05:54:07

It broke higher and appears super bullish on the day. In November, Shiba saw few gains compared to other top meme coins like Doge, Pepe, and Bonk, which rallied hard within a few weeks. It posted small gains and quickly took a bullish break after testing the $0.00003 level. That break brought a three-week retracement and the price dropped near $0.00002. Holding this price level as support, it bounced back but no enough buying volume to bring the bulls back in action and the month ended indecisively. Starting this month on a strong note following a rising demand, trading volatility increased and the price exploded massively following the latest price break. The price is now looking strong again as it sits well above $0.000031 at the time of writing. The main obstacle for the bulls right now is the $0.000046 level, tested in March. Once they manage to push through, we should anticipate a major run from a long-term perspective. A drop from the current trading level could bring a slight retest before resuming bullish. Leading today’s meme coins rally, Shiba is up 30% in the past week as it makes a new shift. It is currently looking bullish on the daily chart. Shiba’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview On the way up, Shiba is facing a minor resistance at $0.000033 while the main resistance sits at $0.0000457. A break out there should skyrocket the price to $0.00006. In case of a drop, $0.00003 is the closest level to consider for support, followed by the $0.000023 level. Lower support levels for drops are $0.000016 and $0.0000125. Key Resistance Levels: $0.000033, $0.0000457, $0.00006 Key Support Levels: $0.000023, $0.000016, $0.0000125 Spot Price: $0.000032 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Historical data shows that the BTC rally can continue to another 46% in December. While BTC is currently flirting around $96,600, this rally could push it all the way to $141,000 by the year-end. Bitcoin Price to Rally in December? After a staggering 37.3% gain in November, Bitcoin is looking forward to a strong year-end in December. Blockchain analytics platform Spot On Chain reported that in December following the elections, Bitcoin price has surged by an average of 30-46% historically. As of press time, BTC price is trading at $96,922 with a market cap of $1.918 trillion. Thus, if Bitcoin replicates its previous performance, the $100K level seems to be easily achievable. With new FOMO-driven market dynamics, their updated model now predicts BTC could climb to $115K by the end of December if we consider 30% gains from here. In the case of a 46% surge, BTC price rally can further extend to $141K by December-end. Source: Spot On Chain Furthermore, popular crypto analyst Ben Armstrong aka BitBoy believes that Bitcoin price could rally to $100,000 levels in the next 48 hours from here. BitBoy bases his prediction on the BTC’s future perpetual data. He noted: “It’s time guys. The next 48 hours. BTC will hit $100,000. The moment we have waited for. Cherish it. We will only get it once”. Source: Bitboy Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Dropping Significantly As per the data from 10x Research , the Bitcoin supply from the exchanges could be drying up pretty fast. Unlike the late summer influx that temporarily boosted exchange inventories, current on-chain data reveals a sharp drop in supply. Furthermore, long-term holders remain steadfast, opting not to release Bitcoin into the market. This can provide an additional catalyst to Bitcoin price from here. Source: 10x Research On the other hand, the Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed more than $31 billion of inflows since their inception scooping massive supply from the market. As reported, the BlackRock traditional funds are also seeking exposure to spot Bitcoin ETFs . 10x Research stated that as of now, only three exchanges – Bitfinex, Binance, and Coinbase, have enough BTC inventory. It added: “Considering that $30 billion in Bitcoin ETF inflows would only secure 300,000 BTC at current prices, Bitfinex’s reserves could last about one year, while Binance and Coinbase have enough supply”. Veteran Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo also confirmed this stating: “If you want some situational awareness of what’s going on, take a look at the BTC reserves on exchanges, nothing short of a supply shock. I don’t know who is buying, but short-term traders are selling their coins to a BTC vacuum cleaner”.

Speaking on CNN's Inside Politics today, Wood said reducing regulatory burdens could help the U.S. regain its position as a global leader in innovation. “The U.S. has almost lost ground in the crypto space,” Wood said, attributing the situation to overregulation during SEC Chairman Gary Gensler’s tenure. He added that the Trump administration’s expected regulatory overhaul could spur growth in emerging sectors like crypto and artificial intelligence, allowing the country to regain a leadership position similar to its dominance during the early internet era. Related News: One Trader Makes 2580x Profit on Surprise Memecoin - Here Are His Trades “A change in the regulatory system where both crypto and AI are the main focuses would be quite significant,” Wood said. Cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence, as well as other transformative technologies such as robotics, energy storage and multiomics sequencing, are also critical platforms that the U.S. must “seize and exploit,” Wood said. Asked about Trump’s proposed tariffs on trading partners, Wood agreed with the approach, saying it made “some sense” if it was balanced with tax cuts to maintain competitiveness. Wood also commented on the potential impact of Trump's return on the stock market, predicting a shift away from the concentrated gains seen in recent years toward broader growth opportunities. “We’ve seen a huge concentration in a very small number of stocks over the last four years,” he said. “I think the market is going to expand right now and reward companies that are at the forefront of innovation.” That broader growth could particularly benefit small and medium-sized businesses, Wood said. *This is not investment advice.

It is likely to enter a correction mode if the price drops daily, though the trend is still bullish. As low-cap altcoins take the stage this week while Bitcoin decides the next move, Theta continued to show strength and exploded massively to a new multi-month high of $3.2 during the November rally. The rally was intercepted today being the first day of December, and as we can see on the daily chart, the price is currently down after a week of consistent increase, showing signs of weakness from the buying side. Despite that, the bulls are still in charge from a short-term perspective. We can expect more rallies if they show strong commitment in the next few hours. Otherwise, the crypto may correct lower before climbing back. Technically, this should provide a little discount in the market. So far, Theta has seen a significant recovery from where it was trading in the past month. While there’s still room for massive growth in the long term, the price must break above March’s high before considering a massive upsurge. All in all, it remains bullish on the daily timeframe. THETA’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview If the bulls counter the latest drop with a push above the recent rejected high, the next target level would be $3.82 – March’s high. A break up from there should send the price to $4 and $5 in no time. The potential support level to watch for the ongoing sell is $2.56. If the price drops below it, Theta may pull back to the $2.06 and $1.66 support before bouncing back.

Thanks to this, bullish predictions are flooding in, with targets as high as $250,000 in 2024 and $13 million long-term. Market dynamics, institutional adoption, and liquidity expansion are driving this optimism. Other macroeconomic events, like a potential Bitcoin reserve under Trump, fuel bullish sentiment even more. Meanwhile, Solv Protocol plans to transform Bitcoin into an active DeFi asset, inspired by MicroStrategy’s strategy of leveraging Bitcoin for yield and corporate growth. Robert Kiyosaki Predicts Bitcoin Correction to 60K Robert Kiyosaki, the well known author of Rich Dad Poor Dad, shared a bold prediction regarding Bitcoin (BTC), and suggested that its price may ”crash” to as low as $60,000. Despite this big potential downturn, Kiyosaki is still optimistic and unfazed. He sees such a correction as a buying opportunity, and stated that he will not sell but instead acquire more Bitcoin during the dip. At press time, Bitcoin is trading hands at $97,561, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The crypto recently reached an all-time high on Nov. 22 before experiencing a minor pullback to $90,742. This price movement reignited discussions about Bitcoin’s volatility and long-term potential. BTC’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) While some, like Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, believe Bitcoin is unlikely to fall below $80,000, Kiyosaki’s outlook focuses less on short-term price fluctuations and more on accumulation. He stated that at this stage, the number of Bitcoin held matters more than its immediate price. Kiyosaki also previously expressed his support for ultra-bullish predictions, like MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor’s projection of Bitcoin reaching $13 million. Additionally, he recently referenced an unidentified AI model predicting Bitcoin will hit $500,000 by 2025. $150K Bitcoin Possible by Copying 2023 Performance Other Bitcoin predictions even suggest that the crypto could reach $250,000 in 2024 or hit $150,000 simply by replicating its 2023 price performance. Tom Lee, co-founder and head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors, shared in an interview with Wealthion that Bitcoin's price cycles, especially those linked to block subsidy halving events, support these ambitious targets. According to Lee, the ”sweet spot” of Bitcoin’s bull run has already started, with the supply cut effects expected to drive massive price growth over the next year. Lee also pointed to a potential game-changer under a new U.S. administration, and suggested that a Bitcoin reserve strategy could lend some much needed legitimacy to the cryptocurrency. By drawing parallels with MicroStrategy, Lee mentioned how adopting Bitcoin as a balance-sheet asset generated immense value for the company’s shareholders. Lee is not the only one who sees massive potential in Bitcoin as commentators like The Bitcoin Therapist echoed a similar sentiment on social media. Meanwhile, other analysts are equally bullish. Trader Dave The Wave believed that Bitcoin could realistically reach $150,000 by mirroring its 186% gain between October of 2023 and March of 2024. He described this price surge as entirely feasible, especially given the current market dynamics and Bitcoin's historical performance. The combination of cyclical supply dynamics, institutional strategies, and market sentiment proves that there is a growing confidence in the cryptocurrency's potential for reaching six-figure valuations in the near future. Bitcoin in Its ‘Parabolic Phase’ Bitcoin is also entering what analysts describe as the ” parabolic phase ” of its current market cycle, with projections suggesting a potential local top of over $110,000 before the end of January. This optimistic forecast aligns with its correlation to the Global Macro Investor’s Total Liquidity Index, which aggregates the balance sheets of major central banks. According to Raoul Pal , CEO of Global Macro Investor, this price level is just a local peak for Bitcoin, with its right-hand side (RHS) potentially peaking in January 2025 before a correction below $70,000 by February. The expected dip is seen as temporary, driven by an ”interim peak in liquidity,” with liquidity projected to continue increasing into the third quarter of 2025. Historically, growing money supply was a major catalyst for Bitcoin's price. Bitget Wallet’s COO, Alvin Kan , pointed out that liquidity injections from the Federal Reserve typically create favorable market conditions for risk assets like Bitcoin as it spurs investor interest and inflows into the crypto market. Other analysts, including Jamie Coutts of Real Vision, suggested that Bitcoin’s price could reach over $132,000 during the year, fueled by the increasing money supply . Historical patterns also indicate that Bitcoin could absorb up to 10% of the new liquidity, which could potentially attract $2 trillion in investments as the global liquidity pool is predicted to expand by $20 trillion. Coutts did warn that Bitcoin cycles sometimes deviate from linear projections, leaving room for even higher price targets. Bitcoin’s rally has also been influenced by broader macroeconomic and political events. Donald Trump’s victory in the recent U.S. presidential election boosted risk appetite in financial markets, and created even more momentum for Bitcoin. Analysts from Bitfinex predict that the new administration's supportive regulatory stance could lead to new all-time highs for cryptocurrencies in 2025. Speculation about the establishment of a strategic Bitcoin reserve under the Trump administration fueled this optimism even more. Blockstream CEO Adam Back suggested that such a move could drive Bitcoin’s price toward $1 million. On-chain MicroStrategy? Solv Protocol is set to launch what it describes as an ”on-chain MicroStrategy,” to transform Bitcoin from a passive store of value into an active asset in decentralized finance (DeFi). Co-founder Ryan Chow announced the initiative, and described it as a transparent and permissionless platform that is designed to strategically manage Bitcoin reserves. The goal is to preserve wealth while still generating yield and amplifying returns, though specifics on exactly how this will be achieved remain unclear. As a Bitcoin staking platform, Solv offers a variety of yield strategies across multiple blockchain networks, leveraging Bitcoin layer-2s like Babylon and CoreChain, and DeFi protocols like Jupiter and Ethena. Currently, the platform oversees more than $3 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to data from DefiLlama . This move draws inspiration from MicroStrategy, the business intelligence firm that has become synonymous with large-scale Bitcoin investments. Since 2020, MicroStrategy pivoted toward Bitcoin accumulation under the leadership of Michael Saylor, and established itself as a de-facto Bitcoin hedge fund. The company’s shares soared by over 450% in 2024 alone thanks to its innovative approach to leveraging its balance sheet for Bitcoin acquisitions. MSTR Bitcoin holdings (Source: MSTR Tracker ) MicroStrategy’s strategy includes the concept of Bitcoin yield, which measures the ratio of BTC holdings to outstanding shares, effectively tying corporate performance to Bitcoin accumulation. The firm also plans to raise $42 billion through equity and debt as part of its ambitious “21/21 Plan,” aiming for a projected Bitcoin yield of 12.7% by 2025. Solv’s effort to replicate this model in DeFi could bridge traditional finance strategies and blockchain innovation. This could position Bitcoin as a much more dynamic and versatile asset in decentralized ecosystems.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-02 06:12:26

This impressive rally pushed XRP past USDT, making it the third-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, currently trading around $2.42 , XRP has seen a remarkable 70% weekly rise and a massive 377% increase over the past month. But here’s what is driving the XRP price Up. Ripple’s RLUSD Stablecoin Awaits NYDFS Approval One of the biggest contributors to XRP’s surge is the news surrounding Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin. Reports suggest that the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) might soon approve RLUSD, with Ripple planning a December 4 launch. If approved, this would allow Ripple to enter New York’s strict digital finance market, enhancing its position in the stablecoin ecosystem. Ripple aims to position RLUSD as a competitor to major stablecoins like Tether (USDT) and Circle’s USDC. Acting as a liquidity bridge within Ripple’s network, RLUSD would work alongside XRP to strengthen Ripple’s global payment offerings. Growing Optimism for an XRP ETF Another factor boosting XRP’s price is growing anticipation for an XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States. With hopes for a more crypto-friendly environment under a potential Trump administration, major players like Bitwise Invest, 21Shares, and Canary Funds have already joined the race by filing for XRP-spot ETFs. WisdomTree recently submitted its application, further fueling excitement in the market. Ripple Wins & Gary Gensler Exit Ripple’s recent legal win against the SEC has also reignited investor confidence. The court’s decision that XRP is not a security in most cases has set a precedent for the entire crypto industry. Adding to this is the announcement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s resignation, set for January 2025. His exit might impact Ripple’s ongoing legal challenges, potentially inclining the ruling in Ripple’s favor. XRP Price Forecast XRP is showing strong growth as the cryptocurrency market recovers. Its performance often moves with the overall market trend. If Ripple keeps building partnerships and wins more legal battles, XRP’s price could rise even higher. It might reach $3.00 to $5.00 in the coming months if more investors get interested. However, there’s also a chance of price drops. Bad news, like new SEC claims or a market downturn, could bring XRP’s price back to $1.50 to $2.00.",News|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|USDT|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-02 06:19:03

According to a Nikkei Asia report , the exchange will shut down operations and sell all assets to SBI Group-owned trading company SBI VC Trade, with the sale expected to be completed by March 2025. A Dec. 2 statement released by SBI VC Trade confirms that the company has reached an agreement with the exchange and will acquire all Japan crypto exchange DMM Bitcoin set for liquidation. The specific date of transfer will be disclosed in an upcoming announcement. As a part of the acquisition, SBI VC Trade will expand its offering by introducing 14 cryptocurrency trading pairs currently available on DMM Bitcoin but not yet supported by SBI VC Trade. This expansion is planned to be completed before the transfer of customer accounts and assets, ensuring a seamless transition for the hacked exchange’s users. The developments are somewhat unexpected considering that DMM Bitcoin had initiated recovery efforts and promised to make all users whole after the May 30 incident. Over 4,500 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $308 million at the time, was drained from one of the exchange’s wallets, making it the second largest hack in Japan, following the $534 million Coincheck hack in 2018. You might also like: Suspected DMM Bitcoin hackers move 500 BTC to new addresses By June, the exchange had secured a 5 billion yen loan to aid in its recovery efforts while assuring customers and regulators that it would raise an additional 50 billion yen via its “group of companies” and subordinated loans. It was a part of the exchange’s plans to raise $320 million to pay back its customers. Meanwhile, in July, the attackers, suspected to be the notorious Lazarus Group, were seen laundering a portion of the stolen funds via Huione Guarantee, an online marketplace turned hub for illicit activities. Additionally, in August, another 500 BTC was moved to multiple wallets. So far, all efforts to recover the stolen assets have failed. DMM Bitcoin becomes the latest Asian exchange to wind down its operations in 2024. WazirX , an Indian-origin exchange, has halted its operations in July after a $235 million hack of its hot wallet. In October, it was revealed that over a dozen South Korean crypto exchanges had shut down in 2024 after failing to comply with local regulations. On Oct. 11, the Singapore-based Fairdesk exchange also cited regulatory challenges before announcing plans to shut down shop.

Is XRP ATH Imminent in December? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News XRP news today highlights its price surge past $2, reaching its highest levels since 2018. This jump, bringing its market cap above $100 billion, comes after a prolonged period of stagnation due to Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC Now, it seems like XRP is reclaiming its place in the market, and there’s more exciting news on the horizon. In a video analysis by Altcoin Daily the analyst charts out the key factors behind this bullish rally. Let’s dive straight into the facts. Ripple’s Stablecoin Could Be a Game-Changer The main factor driving XRP’s rise is Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin , RLUSD. Ripple is close to getting regulatory approval to launch the stablecoin, which could happen as soon as December 4th. The company has been working to ensure it complies with U.S. regulations before going live. Once RLUSD gets the green light, it could have a big impact on XRP’s price. A recent report from Fox Business revealed that the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) could approve RLUSD soon. If this happens, Ripple’s software could be used more widely by traditional banks, which could adopt RLUSD for transactions. As more banks use Ripple’s software, the demand for XRP is likely to rise as well, benefiting the token. Ripple’s Growing Footprint in the Stablecoin Market RLUSD has the potential to make a huge impact on the $200 billion stablecoin market, which is currently led by Tether (USDT) and Circle (USDC). With Ripple already well-integrated into the financial system, the addition of a stablecoin could further boost XRP’s utility and adoption. The more RLUSD is used, the more XRP could be needed for transactions, creating a positive feedback loop that benefits both Ripple and XRP. Legal Battle with the SEC May Soon End Another factor that’s giving positive vibes is the Ripple vs SEC case coming to an end . SEC Chairman Gary Gensler recently announced he will step down in January , and many in the XRP community are hopeful that his departure could lead to a more favorable outcome for Ripple. Legal experts, including attorney Jeremy Hogan, suggest that the SEC may drop all non-fraud crypto cases, including Ripple’s, which could result in a settlement. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ripple Marks a 6-Year High, Smashes $2.5-Here’s the XRP Price Prediction for 2025 After a 300% Rise , Positive Market Signals for XRP Looking at XRP’s technical indicators, there are bullish signs across short, medium, and long-term trends. The moving averages show positive crossovers, suggesting potential price strength. While volatility is moderate at 7.75%, the RSI is at 93.89, indicating neutral conditions. The MACD shows mild upward momentum, signaling positive pressure in the market. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.39. FAQs Is XRP a Good Investment? XRP could be a good investment due to the upcoming launch of Ripple’s stablecoin RLUSD and the potential end of its legal battle with the SEC, which may drive increased demand. However, its volatility and market risks should be carefully considered. Can Ripple reach 100 euros? Reaching 100 euros seems unlikely for XRP, as it would require an unrealistic market cap and drastic changes like massive token burns.

37123939,https://coinpaprika.com/news/how-politics-killed-facebook-s-libra-project,1733125022,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/37123939.jpeg,How Politics Killed Facebook’s Libra Project,https://coinpaprika.com/news/how-politics-killed-facebook-s-libra-project,"David Marcus, the former leader of Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency project, has shed light on the reasons behind the initiative’s failure, pointing to political opposition rather than legal or regulatory challenges. His comments reveal how intense political pressures and the debanking of supporting institutions ultimately dismantled Libra, later rebranded as Diem. Announced in 2019, Libra aimed to transform global payments with a stablecoin backed by a cutting-edge blockchain. Despite its potential and extensive efforts to address regulatory concerns, the project was met with immediate resistance. Marcus shared that political forces were the decisive factor, stating, “There was no legal or regulatory issue left for regulators to use against us. It was a 100% political kill , executed through intimidation of captive banks.” Marcus highlighted key events that led to the project's collapse. Initially postponed to address concerns, Libra faced unwavering political hostility. A major turning point came after a meeting between Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. According to Marcus, Yellen described supporting Libra as “political suicide.” This prompted the Federal Reserve to caution banks involved with the project. Banks reportedly received calls from the Fed's general counsel, warning, “We can’t stop you from launching, but we’re not comfortable with it.” These warnings effectively ended the initiative. Marcus also revealed that this political resistance had broader implications. Kathryn Haun, a former Libra board member, and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founder of Gemini, supported his account. Winklevoss described how Federal regulators halted the project despite its near readiness, stating, “It was all politics, no legal basis .” Reflecting on this experience, Marcus emphasized the importance of decentralization in future financial systems. He argued that truly global monetary networks need to be built on neutral, tamper-proof systems like Bitcoin, saying, “If you want to build an open monetary network for the world—designed to move trillions daily and last for a century—it must be based on the most decentralized and neutral asset: Bitcoin .” Marcus’s revelations have reignited debates about political interference in innovation, particularly in the cryptocurrency sector.

His call comes in response to Operation Chokepoint 2.0, a global initiative aimed at disrupting the crypto industry through measures like debanking, audits, and fines. Hoskinson stressed that internal conflicts must end if the industry hopes to overcome these challenges and achieve mainstream acceptance. In a November 30 post on X (formerly Twitter), Hoskinson addressed his past criticisms of ecosystems such as Bitcoin, XRP, and Solana, urging reconciliation. He encouraged the Cardano community to let go of old grievances and embrace collaboration across all crypto ecosystems. “Let the comments and opinions of the past go and embrace a full reset of all ecosystems,” he wrote. Hoskinson acknowledged that many influencers from rival platforms have previously dismissed Cardano. However, he pointed out that attitudes are shifting, with more people recognizing its potential. He emphasized the need to abandon tribalism , which he sees as a major barrier to widespread adoption and long-term growth. Looking ahead to 2025, Hoskinson envisions a united crypto industry driving progress and expanding markets. He argued that the next two years represent a critical period for the industry to establish itself as a mainstream financial asset . “We have a window to make crypto mainstream and grow our markets to tens of trillions of dollars of value,” he said, urging the community to set aside divisions and seize emerging opportunities. Hoskinson’s comments come as the industry continues to grapple with the effects of Operation Chokepoint 2.0. This campaign, which uses aggressive tactics to isolate crypto businesses, has had a global impact , disrupting financial operations and causing significant harm. “Many businesses were harassed, fined, audited, and de-platformed,” he noted. By focusing on shared goals and building solidarity, Hoskinson believes the crypto industry can overcome external threats and achieve broader adoption. He called on the community to prioritize collaboration, arguing that only a united front can secure the industry's future and unlock its full potential.",,EN,0,0,ADA|BTC|MARKET|SOL|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-02 07:41:37

Mr Chill Doge (MRDOGE), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 14,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MRDOGE is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Mr Chill Doge can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Mr Chill Doge could become the next viral memecoin. Mr Chill Doge launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Mr Chill Doge on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Mr Chill Doge by entering its contract address – FVUdmch8eH4VwV3QVBNGK1mapxGFqdcQtXqgYqYsFGVe – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MRDOGE. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-02 07:42:00

Michael Saylor’s Bold Prediction,https://coinpedia.org/news/will-microsoft-buy-bitcoin-following-microstrategy-michael-saylors-bold-prediction/,"The post Will Microsoft Buy Bitcoin Following MicroStrategy? Michael Saylor’s Bold Prediction appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News MicroStrategy, with its impressive BTC holding of 386,700 BTC, worth $37,335,320,418, is currently the top public company in terms of Bitcoin holdings. Recent developments indicate that the company is now very keen to encourage other companies to adopt Bitcoin. Recently, in a sensational 3-minute presentation, MicroStrategy former CEO Michael Saylor explained why top companies like Microsoft can no longer ignore Bitcoin, and even advised the Redmond-based American multinational technology conglomerate to consider exploring MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy. Here is everything you should know about Saylor’s extraordinary presentation. Saylor About Superiority of Digital Assets Saylor initially explained how global wealth is distributed between assets that provide utility and others that provide capital. He also discussed in detail how risky it is to invest in traditional assets. Presenting digital capital as the best strategy to avoid the threat of risk, he stated that this class of capital is far superior to physical capital. Projecting the emergence of the digital capital sector as a revolutionary advance in the area of capital preservation, he mentioned investors’ growing interest, and its newly received political and economic backing. Bitcoin as the Future of Technology Highlighting Bitcoin as the greatest digital transformation of the 21st century, he described how it has outperformed MicroSoft over the last four years. In the last four years, Bitcoin has seen a growth of 402.005%, while MicroSoft has surged by just 96.71%. Pointing at the charts, like the annualised asset performance chart, showcasing the exceptional performance of Bitcoin over others, Saylor claimed that it is more sensible for MicroSoft to invest in the largest cryptocurrency than to pursue stocks and bonds. Risks of Bonds v.s. Bitcoin Emphasising the capability of Bitcoin to minimise the element of risk, and warning how bonds undermine liquidity, Saylor projected investing in BTC as the only method before MicroSoft to achieve exceptional success. Public and Political Support for Bitcoin Saylor mentioned the growing public support for the Bitcoin market. Highlighting Donald Trump’s recent statement advising investors not to sell Bitcoin, he noted the recent shifts in the political landscape in favour of BTC. Saylor’s Call to Action: Embrace Bitcoin Pointed out how Microsoft has amplified the risks for its shareholders by investing over $200B in the last five years, he explained why the company urgently needs an asset like Bitcoin with no counterparty risk. Advising MicroSoft to convert their cash flows, dividends, buybacks and debts into Bitcoin, Saylor explained how the company could add hundreds of dollars to its value and eliminate risk. Saylor even invited MicroSoft to go through MicrosStrategy’s open source Bitcoin investment model. Finally, MicroStrategy’s former CEO strongly advised MicroSoft to consider investing in Bitcoin, indirectly emphasising it as a move necessary for the general good of the world. In conclusion, Michael Saylor’s call to MicroSoft emphasises the immense potential of Bitcoin as a strategic digital asset.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-02 07:44:53

The BRICS bloc, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has been working on alternatives, including a new currency and the use of digital assets, to reduce reliance on the dollar. In a statement on Truth Social, Trump demanded that BRICS nations abandon these plans. He warned of severe consequences, including 100% tariffs on goods and restricted access to the U.S. market, if the bloc continued pursuing a rival currency. “The idea that the BRICS countries are trying to move away from the dollar while we stand by is over,” Trump stated. He insisted that the U.S. would not allow any attempts to weaken the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency. Trump’s stance aligns with his “America First” policy and campaign promises to protect the dollar’s global dominance. Reports indicate his team is already considering punitive actions against nations backing de-dollarization initiatives. His administration views the BRICS efforts as a threat to U.S. economic power, particularly as the bloc has expanded its membership and influence. The BRICS group has been pushing for alternatives to the dollar since 2023, exploring mechanisms like using local currencies, the Chinese yuan, and blockchain-based stablecoins for trade. These measures could help member nations bypass Western sanctions and reduce dependency on the U.S.-led financial system. At a recent summit, BRICS nations discussed ways to reshape international trade, including creating a new framework that avoids reliance on the dollar. The bloc also expanded its membership for the first time in over a decade, adding Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UAE , Ethiopia, and Egypt. With 34 other nations expressing interest in joining, BRICS aims to strengthen its economic influence and challenge the West’s dominance in global trade. Market analysts suggest that these alternative currencies could allow BRICS countries to avoid U.S. sanctions, offering more flexibility in global transactions. However, Trump’s aggressive response signals a possible escalation in economic tensions between the U.S. and BRICS nations. His administration is expected to take a tough approach to counter these moves, which could reshape the global financial landscape. Observers note that the U.S. and BRICS are on a collision course over the future of international trade. While the BRICS bloc seeks greater independence from the dollar, Trump’s hardline stance underscores the importance of protecting the U.S. economy and its role in global finance. With BRICS’ efforts gaining momentum, this conflict could define a new era of economic competition. Trump’s warning highlights the stakes for both sides as they navigate a rapidly changing global economy.",,EN,0,0,ASIA|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-02 07:45:34

Instead, Base is focused on supporting developers and solving practical challenges in the blockchain space. Jesse Pollak, Base's lead developer, reaffirmed this vision in a statement on November 30. He emphasized that the network’s goal is to create tools that empower developers and enhance decentralized application (dApp) innovation. Pollak highlighted Base’s commitment to being open-source and adhering to open standards and markets, ensuring the network remains accessible and creative. ""There are no plans for a Base network token. We are focused on building and solving real problems,"" he said. This announcement comes as Base continues to achieve remarkable milestones. On November 28, analytics platform Nansen reported that the network had processed 11.4 million transactions, a dramatic increase from the 263,000 it handled the previous year. Base also reached a record-breaking 132.50 daily transactions per second (TPS) on November 26, surpassing its earlier achievement of 106.86 TPS, according to L2beat. Base’s ecosystem has played a crucial role in its success. Popular gaming and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, such as Uniswap and Aerodrome, have thrived on the network. Viral trends like Clanker and Virtuals Protocol memes have further driven user engagement. These factors have helped Base secure the second-highest Total Value Locked ( TVL ) among Ethereum Layer-2 solutions, reaching $12.54 billion, second only to Arbitrum. The network’s strong performance is also linked to its backing by Coinbase, a company valued at $73 billion. With Coinbase’s vast resources and user base, Base offers enhanced scalability and simplified interactions for dApp users. These advantages position Base as a leading competitor in the Ethereum Layer-2 market, outpacing networks like Optimism. By focusing on innovation without relying on token incentives, Base aims to solve real-world problems and continue its growth. Its success underscores the potential of blockchain networks to thrive by prioritizing developer support and practical applications. Base’s commitment to open standards and community-driven innovation ensures its place as a leader in the sector.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|ARB,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2024-12-02 07:49:22

From the breakout on 9 November, Shiba Inu increased nearly 50% before topping out on 12th at the high of $0.00003. After the correction from the top, SHIB has failed to regain strength. However, it trades above the short-term moving averages of 10 and 20. While it has taken support from the 10-DMA several times, it has only touched 20 twice, which indicates that the coin still has strong buying power. According to technical analysis, Shiba Inu is trading inside the triangle pattern, which will work out as a bullish continuation pattern if it breaks out from the upper resistance. The breakout level of this triangle pattern coincides with the $0.000025 resistance level, which is the major level to watch in the next few days. The first target for the SHIB price is $0.00003, the recent swing high. The next target could be the March resistance level of $0.000032. If it breaks down, the major support levels are $0.000022 and $0.00002. Brett trades in bullish flag pattern In technical analysis comparison, Brett has shown stronger strength than Shiba Inu but lags behind Cutoshi. After the rally in early November, Brett has been trading in a bullish flag pattern. This flag pattern in Brett has a depth of 15% and a duration of 14 days. Currently, the price is near the breakout level. If buyers take control, the recent swing high might be taken out. Brett’s relative strength index is at 67, near the overbought zone, but it might go higher if the price breaks the near resistance levels. The MACD is showing mixed signals as the MA lines are flat. The change in direction of the MA lines will further decide the direction of Brett’s price. To learn more about the Cutoshi presale, visit the website.

Eros Biondini introduced a bill on Monday suggesting Brazil's central bank establish a strategic reserve called ResBit. The plan involves gradually purchasing bitcoin until it makes up 5% of Brazil’s national reserves , as reported by local sources. The initiative follows similar moves in the United States, where Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis is advocating for a national bitcoin reserve. Lummis, who previously proposed this idea during the Bitcoin 2024 conference, plans to reintroduce her bill now that Donald Trump is set to return to the White House. Her proposal suggests the U.S. Treasury acquire 1 million bitcoins over five years , to be held for at least 20 years. Lummis believes this approach could help address the national deficit and strengthen the economy. “It’s gaining momentum,” she told the Washington Examiner, emphasizing the need to rally support in Congress. Biondini’s bill highlights how countries like El Salvador and the U.S. are integrating cryptocurrencies into their financial systems. According to the proposal, investing in bitcoin would boost financial sovereignty and support economic growth in Brazil. Both Brazil’s and the U.S.’s plans share some common ground. They propose holding bitcoin in cold storage for security and require public reporting of transactions. However, while Lummis’s bill sets a 20-year holding period, Brazil’s proposal does not specify when the bitcoin could be sold.

U.S. asset managers have filed plans with regulators to launch Bitcoin ( BTC ) exchange-traded funds that use derivatives to eliminate or at least minimize potential losses in an effort to attract cautious investors seeking exposure to the crypto market with reduced risk. According to a Financial Times report on Monday, Dec. 2, the proposals include a range of “buffered” and “managed floor” strategies, which reduce risks by protecting investors from big losses but limit how much profit they can make. Calamos Investments, First Trust Portfolios, Innovator ETFs, and Grayscale Investments are among the firms seeking the green light from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the report reads. Each firm plans to offer products using buffered or managed floor strategies to protect against losses of up to 30%, while some also propose covered call ETFs or leveraged variations.

The filings follow a significant shift in the ETF market as Ethereum ( ETH ) spot ETFs recently recorded a $332.92 million single-day inflow, surpassing Bitcoin ETFs for the first time.

Speaking at a U.K. event hosted by Coinbase-backed advocacy group Stand With Crypto, Shirzad reportedly called the president the most pro-crypto leader in history. “We have the most pro-crypto Congress ever,” he said, referring to Republicans sweeping the House and Senate. With Trump and his allies running the show, Shirzad predicts the long-stalled crypto bills will finally gain traction. For the 50 million Americans holding crypto, this could be the moment their interests are taken seriously in Washington. “I think the combination should finally allow the 50 million Americans who own crypto to have their interests and voice heard in policy,” Shirzad added. Two key bills on the table Congress isn’t starting from scratch. Two major crypto bills are already in the pipeline, and they could reshape how digital assets are treated in the U.S. The first is the Republican-led Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act. This one’s a big deal. It lays out the rules for how crypto will be regulated and managed, something the industry has been screaming for over the past decade. The bill has already passed the House, setting the stage for smoother progress when the new administration steps in. The second bill, the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act, targets stablecoins. Ideally, it would set up a licensing system for stablecoin issuers, creating a solid framework for these tokens, which are critical to the broader crypto ecosystem. But unlike its counterpart, this one hasn’t cleared the House yet. Shirzad is hopeful but realistic, admitting that the stablecoin bill might not see movement until Trump is fully seated well into 2025. Crypto’s political muscle and Gensler’s highly-anticipated departure Trump’s victory wasn’t just a win for him, it was a power move for the entire crypto industry. The numbers back it up. Crypto-related PACs raised over $245 million during the election cycle, according to Federal Election Commission data. That money funded campaigns, rallied support, and stacked Congress with nearly 300 pro-crypto lawmakers. Coinbase’s Stand With Crypto Alliance created a grading system to evaluate candidates based on their crypto stance. The result? A Congress that’s now ready to listen to the industry. Then there’s Gary Gensler, the SEC chair who’s been a thorn in crypto’s side for years. He’s out the door on January 20, the day of Trump’s inauguration. Gensler’s tenure was filled with aggressive crackdowns on crypto. Trump, though, has brought a new direction. Shirzad wouldn’t speculate on who Trump might pick to replace Gensler but said the president-elect has a knack for choosing people who align with his vision. “As long as he picks somebody who’s a change agent, it’ll be good for the U.S., good for society, good for the people that own crypto,” he noted.

According to local media outlet Money Today , Democratic Party floor leader Park Chan-dae announced at a press conference that the DP has agreed to the government’s plan to postpone the tax on crypto traders for another two years, pushing back the bill intended for 2025 to 2027. Park said that the government needs “more institutional preparation” before regulators can systematically begin to tax crypto traders. “After in-depth discussions on the postponement of taxation on virtual assets, I thought that now is the time for additional institutional overhaul,” said Park. The National Assembly will vote on Dec. 2, 2024 to decide the fate of South Korea’s crypto tax proposal, with both parties in agreement to postpone the tax. Initially, the DP had opposed the People’s Power Party’s plans to postpone the launch, insisting that the 20% tax on crypto traders must be launched in January 2025. In addition, the DP had also proposed raising the annual tax threshold from 2.5 million won ($1,781) to 50 million won ($35,633). But the government had rejected the main opposition party’s proposal, instead voting in favor of PPP’s motion to delay the crypto tax to 2027. You might also like: South Korean FSC dismiss plans to build Bitcoin reserve ‘for the time being’ Additionally, Park said that there is still room for negotiations regarding the 13 bills proposed by the government, which include the crypto tax bill, the inheritance bill and the gift tax bill among others. This means that the 20% tax on crypto traders earning a profit minimum of 2.5 million won is still subject to change. “If the government does not take any action, an even greater reduction is possible with the revised plan [which modifies the current reduction plan],” said Park. This marks the third time the South Korean government has decided to postpone the virtual asset tax bill. It was first introduced in December 2020 and scheduled for implementation as early as 2021, but then the bill was delayed to 2025. Now, it has a very strong chance of being postponed even further to 2027. The law would implement a 20% tax with an extra 2% local tax towards profits exceeding 2.5 million won or around $1,781. Several major crypto exchanges argued against the 2.5 million won threshold, saying that a 20% tax on the basic deduction would make trading volumes plummet.

As XRP recently hit a multi-year high of $1.9513, questions have arisen about whether its true market cap is being underreported due to how circulating supply is calculated. Morgan argues that XRP’s market cap should reflect the approximately 62 billion tokens not locked in escrow rather than the 57.8 billion tokens currently reported as its circulating supply by CoinMarketCap. There is less than 38 billion XRP left in escrow which means than when XRP reached $1.90 it’s market cap was almost $118 billion not $107 billion which is not being shown on @CoinMarketCap . If so it has already flipped Solana. pic.twitter.com/oKHLdDwuNY — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) November 30, 2024 Ripple’s XRP holdings recently dropped below 39% , and at $1.90 per token, Morgan claims the market cap should be closer to $118 billion, a significant increase from the $107 billion figure derived from the listed supply. In response to critics, Morgan clarified his methodology, “I am counting 62 billion not in escrow multiplied by $1.90. Do the math.” He dismissed the categorization of Ripple’s holdings outside escrow as “undistributed,” arguing that it is a subjective and arbitrary exclusion from the circulating supply. The debate has drawn mixed reactions. One user countered , “Your maths is off as the circulating supply excludes ‘escrow’ and ‘undistributed.’ The latter belongs to Ripple outside of escrow.” Others reiterated that escrow doesn’t get counted until it has entered the market. Morgan, however, remains firm in his position, emphasizing that his calculations do not include escrowed tokens. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Has XRP Surpassed Solana? This issue is particularly relevant given XRP’s recent performance. After being overtaken by Solana in late 2023, XRP’s resurgence to $1.94 has reignited competition between the two assets. Morgan shared a screenshot showing Solana’s market cap at $115 billion at the time of his post, but his recalculations suggest XRP may have already surpassed it. At the time of press, XRP is trading at $2.42, up over 30% in the past 24 hours. The digital asset has officially flipped Solana and Tether (USDT) to reclaim the third position after years of struggles and price suppressions. Many experts have predicted that XRP will surpass Ethereum in this cycle. However, Morgan’s post is important as it highlights a significant valuation issue in the market that could hamper digital assets.

However, when it comes to crypto trading, things haven’t been smooth sailing, and traders have had to deal with the impacts of a more complex and saturated crypto market. This has included volatility levels reaching all-time highs , trading fees going up, and liquidity being spread thin across exchanges. The good news is that with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), crypto traders and developers now have the ability to create powerful AI agents that provide a competitive edge . Amongst these is Monitok’s hybrid crypto exchange with an AI trading assistant, which goes beyond mere automation, and offers predictive analytics, personalized trade recommendations, and real-time risk management – to name a few features. Challenges That Modern Crypto Traders Face With crypto markets becoming increasingly saturated and unpredictable, traders are confronted with a host of new challenges, creating roadblocks that can be overwhelming without the right support or solution in place. Let’s dive into some of the most common challenges currently facing crypto traders. 1) Overwhelming amount of new tokens With thousands of crypto tokens launching across multiple blockchain networks, crypto traders face an increasingly difficult task—finding value amidst a flood of new assets. This oversaturation often leads to confusion and missed opportunities as traders struggle to evaluate each new project (due to a lack of time), and also increases the risk of falling into illiquid or low-performing assets. 2) Increased volatility Although volatility is often one of the reasons why crypto swing traders can make impressive gains, it’s also one of the most dangerous aspects of trading. This is because market conditions can change in seconds, and many traders often find themselves ill-equipped or unable to respond to sudden price swings in both a rapid and informed manner. 3) Liquidity fragmentation Another common frustration amongst crypto traders is an increase in liquidity fragmentation. With liquidity often spread thinly across various exchanges and platforms, trading conditions have suffered, and often result in slippage, delays, or poor pricing. This not only reduces efficiency but creates extra hurdles for those looking to execute large trades or capitalize on quick market shifts. 4) High transaction fees + network congestion Rising transaction fees and network congestion continue to be persistent issues in the crypto space. During busy periods, network slowdowns can cost traders valuable time and money, while high gas fees can take away from profits. So without efficient management, these issues can become costly; and for even the most skilled of traders. 5) AI-driven competition As AI crypto bots become more omnipresent and readily available, it’s starting to create a divide between those who use them, and those who don’t. AI trading bots are often outpacing the manual data collection and analyses of most crypto traders, and also offer superior evaluation of crypto asset performance. AI does this by being able to collect, track and interpret the “right” data correctly, helping to foresee the impact of macro events to markets, and knowing when to take profit; helping traders to manage emotions and greed. This gives those who embrace AI a distinct advantage. AI Technology in Modern Crypto Trading Given the challenges seen above, it’s not surprising how more and more developers are seeking to leverage AI to enhance crypto trading. Below are some examples of how AI is revolutionizing crypto trading. How AI is revolutionizing crypto trading Firstly, AI has the ability to detect patterns in large datasets and provides traders with insights that would otherwise be missed. More specifically, AI-powered tools can identify correlations between market events, price movements, and trading volume that are nearly impossible for humans to spot. This enables traders to refine their strategies with next-level precision. Another very impressive (and useful) feature of AI for crypto trading is its ability to process vast amounts of quantitative data and in real-time. So instead of having to spend ages manually analyzing order books, technical indicators, and market sentiment, AI allows traders to do this far quicker, and more efficiently. This in turn allows traders to rapidly respond to market shifts during periods of high volatility. AI-powered bots also have the ability to automate the trading process in ways that can greatly enhance efficiency. Executing trades faster than humans ever could, allows traders to act on opportunities the moment they arise. But perhaps the most appealing utility is AI’s predictive models, which attempt to forecast price movements by analyzing historical data and current trends, and at times yields surprisingly accurate predictions. Although not foolproof, these AI models can be very useful for managing risks, and gauging potential market shifts. How Monitok’s AI Assistant Simplifies Decision-making To bring additional value to users, Monitok’s revolutionary hybrid crypto exchange will be incorporating a cutting-edge AI assistant to help simplify (and enhance) the decision-making process based on users’ profiles and market trends. Below there are some of the core features of the new AI assistant, and how they will each bring value to Monitok users. Predictive analytics for trading Monitok’s AI assistant includes predictive analytics and will process real-time data and historical trends to help traders identify patterns, and anticipate market movements with greater accuracy. This is a process that usually takes human hours to conduct manually. Personalized AI trade recommendations Monitok’s AI assistant is more than a one-size-fits-all solution and offers personalized trade recommendations by analyzing users’ trading habits, risk tolerance, and market conditions. This is designed to optimize profits whilst simultaneously saving users time. Automated trade selection To further simplify the trading process, Monitok’s AI assistant automates trade selection, executing transactions at the most opportune moments. This reduces the burden on traders to constantly monitor the market and react to rapid price fluctuations. Gauging social sentiment By collecting on-chain data, and scraping data from crypto social media and news outlets, the AI assistant iwill then feed them through an LLMs to provide a holistic social sentiment on various markets, tokens and projects. Real-time risk management Last but not least, Monitok’s AI assistant offers real-time risk management, meaning it continuously monitors market conditions and adjusts strategies to mitigate potential losses. This feature is particularly useful during market downturns. Why Monitok’s Users Should be Excited While there are a few AI trading bots in the crypto industry, most fail to address the full spectrum of challenges traders face. Monitok, however, will offer something far more well-rounded with its AI trading assistant (set to be released in Q3, 2025) and revolutionary hybrid exchange, which already solves key issues such as a lack of security, complex user experience, and fragmented liquidity. Therefore, the future addition of an AI assistant is the cherry on the cake, as providing features like personalized trade recommendations, predictive analytics, and automated trade selection will work in perfect harmony with Monitok’s hybrid infrastructure; giving traders more control, precision and speed. A match made in heaven if you will. It’s important to note that staking $MONY will unlock various AI features, and will give users the ability to personalize their own apps. For this reason, Monitok’s ongoing $MONY Airdrop Rain Season, and upcoming token launch will provide users with a great opportunity to accumulate enough $MONY to start experimenting with the platform’s AI. In the meantime, the Monitok team will continue to work diligently on the platform’s AI features and recommends that all interested users follow the project on its Twitter page to keep up to date with the latest developments.",AI and Tech,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-02 08:00:23
37124655,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=656242,1733126445,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,"Crypto Analyst Says Litecoin Is About To Pull An XRP, Here’s What He Means",https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/ltc/litecoin-about-to-pull-an-xrp/,"Crypto analyst Tony Severino said Litecoin is about to pull an XRP, suggesting that the coin could soon enjoy a parabolic rally. The analyst alluded to a bullish indicator on LTC’s chart, which showed that the crypto could witness this parabolic rally. Litecoin Is About To Pull An XRP, Here’s Why In an X post, Tony Severino said that Litecoin is about to pull an XRP, noting that the crypto is now above the monthly upper Bollinger Band . This suggests that LTC has undergone the necessary price correction and is now well-primed for a bullish reversal. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that a wick to the upside was already forming for the crypto on the monthly chart. Severino didn’t give a price target for how high Litecoin could rally when this move to the upside occurs. However, the chart showed that the $150 and $300 price levels were in view, a rally that could ultimately pave the way for LTC to rally to its current all-time high (ATH) of $412. It is worth mentioning that the crypto analyst had also recently made a similar analysis for XRP. Before now, Severino mentioned XRP is just above the monthly upper Bollinger Band just as BB Width expands from the tightest squeeze in XRP history. He added that this is going to shock and awe. Since then, XRP has enjoyed a parabolic rally of over 200% and is now above the $2 mark, a level the analyst’s chart showed the crypto could surpass. Therefore, this Litecoin analysis is undoubtedly one to watch since the crypto analyst predicts that LTC will pull an XRP. Litecoin has yet to enjoy its bull run, although it already looks to be catching up, considering it is up over 24% in the last seven days. The Next Dino Coin To Run? Like Severino, crypto analyst Crypto Snorlax has also suggested that Litecoin will be the next ‘ Dino coin ’ to witness a parabolic rally. In an X post , the analyst highlighted a chart overlaying XRP’s price action over LTC’s. Based on this analysis, Crypto Snorlax revealed two interesting findings. Firstly, he noted that there is a strong correlation between old altcoins. With XRP recording a 5x price increase from its bottom range, the analyst expects Litecoin to follow shortly. Secondly, Crypto Snorlax revealed that Litecoin just broke above $115, an 18-month resistance. Therefore, Litecoin is well primed for a significant rally, having flipped this resistance to support. The analyst’s accompanying chart showed that LTC could enjoy up to a 3x price increase and reach as high as $450, which would mark a new ATH for the crypto. At the time of writing, Litecoin is trading at around $121, up over 20% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",LTC|XRP|analyst|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news|Litecoin|Litecoin news|litecoin price|ltc|LTC news|ltc price|ltc/usd|LTCUSDT|Ripple|ripple news|xrp|xrp news|XRP Price|XRPUSD|xrpusdt,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|LTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-02 08:00:45

In a post on social media platform X, the longtime Bitcoin bull says that those who save their money in fiat currencies will be left behind by those who save in BTC and precious metals. Kiyosaki says that after a certain point, the poor and the middle class will have missed their chance to get into BTC at a reasonable price, cementing their place on the wealth ladder. “THE RICH WILL GET RICHER: Q: WHO WILL BE RICHER? A: The people who save Gold, Silver. Bitcoin. I own all three financial assets. Q: WHO WILL BE POORER? A: The people who save dollars, Pesos, Yen, Euro, & Loonies. As I warned in Rich Dad Poor Dad ‘Savers are losers…because cash is trash.’ Bitcoin will soon break $100,000. Once Bitcoin passes $100,000, it will be almost impossible for the poor and middle class to catch up. The horse will be out of the barn and running. WHY? Once Bitcoin breaks $100,000, ONLY the ultra-rich such as corporations, banks, and sovereign wealth funds will be able to afford Bitcoin of any consequence. FOMO (fear of missing out) is good. Don’t be left behind. Don’t let the rich get richer…without You. Take care.” Last month, Kiyosaki said that his goal was to own 100 BTC, regardless of price. At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $97,567.

We can see that CryptoBox combines simplicity, security, and profitability, making it the premier choice for staking in 2025. Binance – Big Ecosystem, Lower Rewards Binance, one of the largest crypto exchange, also offers staking with a wide range of assets. Users benefit from its brand reputation and ease of use with trading. But Binance’s staking rewards are lower than CryptoBox and it does not have advanced AI-driven insights to maximize earnings. Features: Wide selection of staking coins Reputable exchange with high volume Fixed and flexible staking options While Binance is a big name, CryptoBox’s AI and bonuses make it to have a better staking experience. Kraken – Trusted Platform, Limited Staking Options Kraken is another big player in the crypto space, offering staking for popular assets like Ethereum, Polkadot, and Solana. The platform is user-friendly for beginners but has limited staking options compared to CryptoBox’s 100+ assets. Features: High security and transparency Daily staking rewards for select assets Easy onboarding process While Kraken is reliable, CryptoBox has more assets and higher returns for serious investors. Stakewise – Liquid Staking With Fewer Perks Stakewise specializes in liquid staking, users can unlock staked funds for trading or other purposes. While this is useful, Stakewise doesn’t have CryptoBox’s AI-driven tools and bonuses like a free $100 sign up bonus and lifetime referral commissions. Features: Liquid staking for Ethereum Decentralized platform with a focus on transparency Lower fees for staking services CryptoBox’s seamless integration of liquid staking with AI and its lucrative cashback rewards make it the better option for maximizing returns. Lido Finance – Leading Ethereum Staking Platform Lido Finance is the biggest Ethereum staking platform where users can earn rewards while having liquidity. Its popularity is mainly due to its simplicity and decentralized model. But it does not have multi-asset support and bonuses like CryptoBox’s Million Bounty Program which makes it less appealing. Features: Liquid staking for Ethereum and a few other assets Decentralized governance model Competitive staking rates Lido is good for Ethereum-focused investors, whereas CryptoBox is good for investors with 100+ assets and custom plans. Coinbase – Beginner Friendly, High Fees Coinbase offers staking as part of its exchange, convenient for new users. But the fees are high, cutting into potential profits. In contrast, CryptoBox ensures users keep more of their earnings and has AI-driven staking strategies for better results. Features: Big exchange with easy-to-use app Educational resources for beginners Limited staking options with high fees For those who want to earn more with less effort, CryptoBox delivers better value with a free staking plan and higher daily rewards which you get to keep. Conclusion Staking continues to offer an excellent pathway for earning passive income in the crypto world.

Coinbase ‘s top policy executive expects U.S. cryptocurrency regulations to move quickly once Donald Trump assumes the presidency in January 2025. In an interview with CNBC on Dec. 2, Coinbase’s chief policy officer Faryar Shirzad said that crypto legislation will likely progress “fairly quickly” through Congress after Trump takes office, pointing to the Republican president-elect’s strong pro-crypto stance and the party’s recent control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. “We have the most pro-crypto Congress ever and an extraordinarily pro-crypto president. This combination should allow the 50 million Americans who own crypto to have their interests heard in policy.” Faryar Shirzad You might also like: Trump in considerations for CFTC to regulate crypto CNBC notes that Shirzad’s comments coincide with two significant pieces of crypto-related legislation advancing through Congress: the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act and the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act. The first aims to establish a legal framework for cryptocurrencies and passed the House earlier this year, while the second seeks to regulate stablecoin issuers but has not yet been approved by the House. Shirzad expressed optimism that the bills will pass, though he acknowledged the chance of consideration in the current “lame duck” session is low. He expects major progress on both the market structure and stablecoin bills in 2025.

Besides, the top two cryptos, Bitcoin & Ethereum, continue to juggle within a narrow range, probably due to a massive liquidity shift into the other tokens. One among them is Dogecoin, which showed huge strength in the past few days and is currently preparing for another bullish wave. DOGE price broke the multi-year consolidation that held the levels largely below $0.15 and launched a 350% jump to mark the yearly highs at $0.48. Although the bulls seem to have halted a bit, they continue to maintain an ascending range, which suggests the top memecoin is preparing for the next bullish wave. With this, will the DOGE price reach $1 in 2025? The long-term price action suggests the bulls are strengthening their position to trigger a 500% rise over the next few months. The price remains consolidated within a rising parallel channel, and the recent rise from the pattern could push the price towards the resistance. Besides, the RSI entered the overbought zone and turned flat. However, the possibility of a continued upswing remains elevated as long as RSI trades within the bullish range, with the target at $0.7 for 2024 and over $11 in 2025. Besides, in the short term, the DOGE price is trading within a bull flag by maintaining a sustained rise within a pennant. With this, the price is expected to revamp a rise beyond $0.5, which may place the token at the edge of a massive explosion. A breakout from the range may trigger a 100% rise to mark $1, probably before the end of 2024 or in the first few days of 2025. On the other hand, memecoins like SHIB, PEPE, FLOKI, etc. have been ranging within a rising pattern, and hence, after a breakout, the price could trigger a huge upswing, forming new highs.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|DOGE|SHIB|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-02 08:05:48

The Trump administration has promised a tone of goodies for the cryptocurrency industry due to the overwhelming support during last month’s election. Already, institutional investors’ confidence in the cryptocurrency industry has significantly surged in the recent past. Furthermore, the overall crypto cash inflow, as observed by the US spot BTC and Ether ETFs, has increased the ongoing bullish outlook. The Ex Parte Garland Playbook As the United States undergoes a crucial transition to welcome the Trump administration, the difference with the Democrats has been exacerbated by today’s President Biden’s pardon for his son, Hunter Biden. Furthermore, President Biden pardoned Hunter not only for the gun and tax convictions but also for any crime he might have committed in the last decade. As a result, Hunter is immune from any potential investigation by the Trump administration. Consequently, the crypto community has been pushing the upcoming Trump administration to exercise its powers to pardon unfair treatment of Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ).
