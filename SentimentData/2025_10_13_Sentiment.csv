What started as just another volatile day descended into chaos after the US imposed 100% tariffs on China, leaving the markets reeling. Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted to a low of $102,000 on Binance, with fears of a drop below $100,000, as the cryptocurrency market shed over 10% of its value amid plummeting prices. Market Carnage The cryptocurrency market suffered tremendous losses on Saturday, with over $19 billion wiped out, according to data from Coinglass. Coinglass described the crash as “the largest liquidation event in crypto history.” Markets crashed after President Trump imposed 100% tariffs on China and new export controls on software. The announcement triggered a steep decline in Bitcoin prices, which fell to a low of $102,000 on Binance. However, it has recovered since and is currently trading above $111,000. CoinGlass also reported that over 1.6 million traders were liquidated over the past 24 hours, with over $7 billion in positions sold in less than an hour on Friday. However, it noted that total losses could be significantly higher. Meanwhile, Binance suffered a major outage, adding to an already chaotic day. Many users reported frozen accounts, failed stop-loss orders, and flash crashes that briefly sent some altcoins to near zero. Experts have warned of a broader market contagion, with some estimates predicting total liquidations above $30 billion. Brian Strugats, head trader at Multicoin Capital, stated, “The focus is now on counterparty exposure and whether this triggers broader market contagion.” Meanwhile, Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, put Bitcoin's next support line at $100,000, adding that a drop below this level could signal the end of the bull cycle. “A drop below this would signal the end of the past three-year bull cycle.” Crypto Community In Shock As Trader Shorts Bitcoin Right Before Crash The cryptocurrency community has been rocked by potential market manipulation after a trader shorted Bitcoin minutes before the market crash. According to crypto analyst Vivek Sen, the account was created on the same day of the crash, raising widespread suspicion and concern among the crypto community. “SOMEONE JUST OPENED A #BITCOIN SHORT 30 MINS BEFORE TRUMP'S TARIFF ANNOUNCEMENT AND JUST CLOSED WITH $88,000,000 PROFIT. HE OPENED THIS ACCOUNT TODAY.” Members of the cryptocurrency community have accused the trader of insider activity, with crypto attorney John Deaton calling for a full investigation. Saturday’s crash is one of the largest liquidation events in crypto history, triggered by the US government imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls on software. The announcement sent shockwaves through crypto and financial markets, with Bitcoin , Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies trading deep in the red. CoinGlass data revealed that $19 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated within 24 hours, with $7 billion of the liquidations occurring in just one hour on Friday. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has reclaimed $111,000 after suffering one of the largest crashes in its history, plunging to a low of $102,000 on Binance. The flagship cryptocurrency traded above $122,000 on Wednesday before dropping to $121,000 on Thursday. However, markets crashed after the US announced sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls after China announced curbs on rare earth minerals. The developments caught traders off guard, sending shockwaves through the market. Experts believe there is a chance for the decline to spill over into next week after the weekend. Head of Markets Ray Salmond stated, “If we look at liquidation heatmap data from Hyblock Capital, which basically shows where all the short and long positions are across various orderbooks at centralized crypto exchanges, we can see that there’s a liquidity pocket of long positions that are being exploited…that pocket extends from $120,000 to $115,000 and from $115,000 to $113,000.” However, spot Bitcoin ETFs helped cushion the downside, reporting net inflows of $2.72 billion for the week ending Friday. The Kobeissi Letter commented on Friday’s selloff, stating, “Volume was so strong that it led to the first EVER $20,000 candlestick in Bitcoin, a -$380 BILLION drop in market cap, before a V-shaped bottom as shorts were closed. Not only was this the largest liquidation ever, it was nine times the previous record. This event will be referenced for years to come.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs reported net outflows of $4.5 million on Friday. BTC heads into a crucial week, with a Senate vote on a stopgap funding bill, which could act as a catalyst for price action. The flagship cryptocurrency could rebound if the funding bill passes. Markets will also be watching for US-China trade developments as the APEC summit nears. BTC started the weekend positively, registering a marginal increase and settling at $122,458. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rallied, surging past $125,000 to a new all-time high of $125,559. However, it could not stay at this level and ultimately settled at $123,520. BTC surged to a new all-time high on Monday, crossing $126,000 to reach $126,296 before settling at $124,720. Despite strong bullish momentum, BTC retreated on Tuesday, falling nearly 3% and settling at $121,393. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising almost 2% to reclaim $123,000 and settle at $123,343. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $119,713 before reclaiming $120,000 and settling at $121,714. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as President Trump imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, decimating investor sentiment. As a result, BTC fell as low as $102,000 on Binance before closing the day at $112,980. The price continued dropping on Saturday, falling to an intraday low of $109,683 before settling at $110,768. BTC is up almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $111,649. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Meanwhile, President Trump is contemplating a presidential pardon for Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. However, the administration is worried about the optics of such a decision. Here are the biggest stories of the week! Bitcoin Luxembourg's Intergenerational Sovereign Wealth Fund has allocated 1% of its portfolio to Bitcoin ETFs and other crypto assets. The decision, announced by finance minister Gilles Roth, makes Luxembourg the first country in the Eurozone to invest in Bitcoin through its sovereign fund. Crypto entrepreneur Roger Ver , popularly called “Bitcoin Jesus,” reached a deal with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to have his tax evasion case dropped. Ver was arrested in April 2024 and charged with mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. Ethereum Crypto asset manager Grayscale has enabled staking for its US Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and its Ethereum Mini Trust ETF products. The decision allows investors to earn additional yield on their holdings. The asset manager has also activated staking for the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL). Business Web3 wallet MetaMask has introduced perpetual contract trading after launching in-wallet access to Hyperliquid’s DEX market. The feature will help MetaMask establish itself as an all-in-one self-custodial trading and investment hub for global finance. Dogecoin treasury company CleanCore announced that it holds 710 million DOGE worth $188 million. The company aims to hold 1 billion DOGE and is backed by the Dogecoin Foundation. Intercontinental Exchange , the parent entity of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), has announced a $2 billion stake in prediction market platform Polymarket. The move marks its foray into event-driven markets and enhances the platform’s credibility in the US. RWA tokenization platform Ondo Finance completed the acquisition of Oasis Pro, a regulated digital asset broker-dealer and alternative trading system (ATS). The deal allows Ondo Finance to develop and provide tokenized securities markets in the US. Web3 NEAR has developed the Intents framework for seamless, multichain execution. Intents utilizes solvers and chain signatures to create a process that feels as simple as a token swap. For developers, Intents enables the creation of dApps that can interact with multiple chains. Developers can also access the tooling and libraries that come bundled with Intents. Decrypt has partnered with Opera, bringing Decrypt’s breaking news and industry analysis directly into the Opera browser. Regulation The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will formalize an “innovation exemption” for crypto and digital asset companies by the end of the year. The exemption will allow companies to leverage digital assets and other innovative technologies in the US. President Trump is reportedly considering a presidential pardon for Binance founder Changpeng Zhao . A presidential pardon could restore Zhao’s reputation in the cryptocurrency industry and clear the path for a return to Binance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

On May 17, 2023, Tether said it would regularly allocate up to 15% of net realized operating profits to purchase bitcoin for reserves, adding BTC to surplus rather than using it to back circulating USDT one-for-one. The company framed the move as strengthening its balance sheet with a long-term store of value. BTC and gold as parallel pillars Gold sits alongside bitcoin in that mix. Tether issues tether gold (XAUt), a token backed by allocated bars, and said on July 24 that more than 7.66 tons of metal backed outstanding tokens as of June 30, 2025. Separately, as CoinDesk reported on Sept. 5, 2025, citing the Financial Times, Tether has held talks to invest across the gold value chain — from mining and refining to royalties — as part of a broader diversification push. Ardoino has grouped the assets rhetorically before. On Sept. 7, he referenced bitcoin, gold and land as hedges and later dismissed suggestions that Tether sold BTC to accumulate gold, saying the firm remained committed to growing its bitcoin position. Today's eight-word post is less a policy shift than a restatement — bitcoin as a strategic asset added with profits, and gold as a parallel pillar via tokenization and potential upstream investments — while most reserves remain in liquid instruments such as U.S. Treasurys per attestations. The next reserve report, expected late this month or early next month, will show whether allocations to BTC and gold have changed. As of Sunday, 8:10 p.m. UTC, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) was down 8.88% year to date, while bitcoin and gold — BTC-USD and XAU-USD — were up 22.79% and 52.91%, respectively, according to MarketWatch.",Markets|Bitcoin|Gold|Tether|Tether Gold|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|USDT|XAUT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-12 20:48:52

With geopolitical tensions rising, the European nation is strengthening its ties to China and diversifying its economy. The Swiss government is looking east for stability and diversification as it intensifies trade relations with China due to the record-high tariffs on exports imposed by the U.S. administration. According to a joint statement issued on Friday, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi agreed to speed up the negotiations to upgrade the 2014 free trade agreement between their countries. The announcement came after the fourth round of a strategic dialogue held in Bellinzona, a town in southern Switzerland. Switzerland looks to China as U.S. relations remain strained The free trade agreement with China was the first such deal that China signed with a continental European country. Since then, trade volumes between the two nations have grown substantially, with Switzerland exporting high-tech goods, pharmaceuticals, and luxury products while importing electronics and industrial components. Both governments said that modernizing the decade-old pact will help make bilateral trade “more predictable and sustainable” while promoting a more open and balanced form of globalization. The Swiss economy has quickly felt the impact of the 39% tariffs imposed on exports by the United States in August, which is dependent on its advanced manufacturing and pharmaceutical industries. Trade tensions between Switzerland and the U.S. have already affected the nation’s manufacturing and export sectors. The recent alignment with China comes as the Swiss government fails to make progress in negotiations with Washington over the tariff burden. Swiss Foreign Minister Cassis emphasized that cooperation with China does not come at the expense of relations with Western allies.

CZ has directly addressed suspicions about BNB’s stability as most “blue-chip” altcoins fell significantly while BNB saw a minimal dip of around 2-3% before quickly recovering, outperforming its peers. In response to an X post that called attention to BNB’s “barely affected” performance, CZ wrote : “Fudders even try to make this sound like a bad thing? 😂🤷‍♂️Please post more of this about #BNB . 🙏” BNB is ‘SAFU’ The former Binance CEO has since been reposting tweets reflecting the same sentiment, including one that reminded people that BNB’s price was not affected even when “CZ was in the USA” because he “built a strong infrastructure called Community.” “New chain comers might not understand it, but we do. New comers will experience it. This is why i keep saying BNB & ASTER are SAFU and everything will be just FINE,” the tweet concluded. In response to another bullish tweet about BNB, CZ pointed out that BNB is one of the few projects that does not have a market maker. “I am not aware of any of my affiliated entities buying or selling #BNB in the past days / weeks,” he wrote before listing out BNB’s sound attributes, including its deflationary status. CZ is unbothered by the FUD While other blue-chip altcoins fell significantly during the peak of the liquidation event, with some falling as far as 80% in meme-heavy segments, BNB only fell by about 17% before rebounding. BNB price lost minimal value and quickly bounced back during a weekend that rocked most of the market. Source: Coinmarketcap Notably, BNB’s intraday loss outpaces its modest 7-day decline, signaling strong buying pressure re-emerging at key psychological levels despite the value hemorrhaging out of the markets. Also, CoinMarketCap data shows that BNB’s limited fall puts it alongside Bitcoin as one of the only top-five cryptocurrencies that have recorded minimal daily losses despite market liquidations exceeding $19 billion at the peak of the disaster. This confirms that there is active “flight-to-safety” rotation toward assets showing strength like BTC and BNB even as the market struggles to recover. As one user pointed out, one big reason why BNB has been able to defend its recent gains is its strong community. However, that’s not all. BNB also benefits from multiple demand catalysts, including trading fee discounts and increasing network revenue during heightened volatility, functions that make it an attractive hedge during events like the recent market crash. It is also important to note that CZ has always supported BNB with his massive platform, often encouraging builders and swatting down FUD. Both acts reassure holders and have translated into great strength for the token. Get seen where it counts.

Even though names like Shiba Inu (SHIB) are showing renewed instances of vibrancy, all the excitement today is around fresher names showing better potential gain. However, as bright as the potential for SHIB is within this cycle, the spotlight is quickly shifting over to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , one DeFi gem valued only $0.035 currently. Now in Phase 6 of presale, already sold out by over 65%, MUTM is grabbing whale attention with its dual-lending strategy combining conventional finance with DeFi lending optimization. By the new means to earn yields combined with strong early traction, many are predicting MUTM is going to make small bets big by earning life-changing profit by the price all the way up to $1 by 2026. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Targets $0.00005 Shiba Inu (SHIB) seems set up to anticipate the reversal from the current trending direction after staying immobile for weeks. The token technically catches up near the potential floor support level at $0.0000108, where the buyers have traditionally fractured the price to rescue. If the floorhold stands good for the token, experts believe that the price will skyrocket up to the reversal level around $0.0000176, translating to resistance. The news will pave the way up for the general bullish breakdown, propelling speculations up to the much-awaited $0.00005 mark. However, most mature investors are shifting their focus from projects with deteriorating fundamentals and usability to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi behemoth. Mutuum Finance Dominates in Q4 Mutuum Finance’s presale is currently in Phase 6, having raised so far over $17.25 million and attained 16,860 investors. That is an indication of increasing confidence towards the project’s future and makes Mutuum Finance a very viable ecosystem for investors aiming for sustainable return and long-term profit. The protocol also includes an active Loan-to-Value (LTV) framework and liquidation process that respond automatically to price shock to impose firmness amidst fluctuations. Reserve multipliers ranging from 10% to 35%, varied according to collateral risk profiles, also incorporate an additional level of surety, hence making the platform firmer as well. MUTM also includes a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program whose vulnerability classification is comprised of four levels, namely the critical, the major, the minor, and the low. This is supplemented by the open architecture design of the platform architecture combined with security-by-design, making the DeFi protocol secure, stable, and robust for the users. Mutuum Finance Borrowing & Lending Protocol The platform is soon launching a game-changing lending and borrowing protocol . The protocol’s Version 1 (V1) will be launched on Sepolia Testnet within Q4 2025 with key functionalities including the liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will have day-one support for the borrowing, lending, and collateralization, the users will be able to have an open-ended, scalable, and efficient DeFi experience. With the market gaining pace, the best investment suggestion for investors investing $1,000 is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM at just $0.035 today is set to skyrocket past $1, far outshining Shiba Inu. Already raising an impressive $17.25M from over 16,860 investors, the dual-lending strategy, active mechanism for LTV, and security-minded design of Mutuum make it sit among the big boys within the DeFi.

From meme coin mania, DeFi, AI, and RWAs, Solana has managed to capture several on-chain revenue streams that Ethereum couldn’t monetize early, a new report suggests. Solana’s Early Growth Curve According to 21Shares, the blockchain generated roughly $2.85 billion in revenue between October 2024 and September 2025, after averaging nearly $240 million per month. Peaks during periods of intense trading activity were found to be more than $600 million, with January 2025 marking the absolute high point at $616 million. This surge was driven largely by meme coin mania, including coins like Trump Coin. Even after the speculative frenzy cooled, Solana’s monthly revenues have remained in the $150 million-$250 million range. Such sustained figures demonstrated that the chain’s success “is not merely a speculative flash in the pan.” A closer look at the revenue composition reveals a highly diversified ecosystem. Trading applications such as Photon and Axiom contributed $1.12 billion, or 39% of the total, by facilitating faster swaps, advanced execution, and high-frequency activity. Beyond trading, Solana’s infrastructure supports a broad spectrum of DeFi, AI, DePin, and tokenized real-world asset applications. Its architecture, capable of thousands of transactions per second at sub-$0.01 costs, has effectively transformed Solana into a 24/7, global “on-chain Nasdaq,” which has helped it rival long-established Web 2 companies like Palantir ($2.8 billion in 2024) and Robinhood ($2.95 billion) in annual revenue. Perspective Check The contrast with Ethereum during its formative years couldn’t be more obvious. Between 2019 and 2020, roughly four to five years after Ethereum’s launch, monthly revenue averaged less than $10 million, which is less than 5% of what Solana now produces on a monthly basis. In peak months, Solana’s revenue has outpaced Ethereum’s early numbers by more than 50x. While Ethereum’s growth was constrained by congestion and modest gas fee revenue in a nascent DeFi ecosystem, Solana has leveraged high throughput and low fees to monetize a broader range of activity much earlier in its lifecycle. Daily active addresses on Solana now consistently hit 1.2-1.5 million, compared to Ethereum’s 400,000-500,000 during its early years. Solana’s revenue growth has not been linear. 21Shares found that just two years ago, between October 2022 and September 2023, total network revenue stood at a mere $13 million, which can be attributed to early skepticism amid outages and market turbulence. The 220x increase over the past 12 months, however, was a shift from experimental blockchain to a commercially viable ecosystem. Soon after, institutional interest followed suit. Currently, over $3 billion in SOL is held on public company balance sheets, and multiple treasury initiatives are underway from firms including Forward Industries, Pantera Capital, and Brera Holdings.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.6347 Market cap $632.56M Trading volume (24-hour) $24.76M Circulating supply 1.06B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.6027 24-hour low $0.5609 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.89% 50-day SMA $0.7227 14-Day RSI 29.32 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-day SMA $0.7064 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos is up 9%, showing early signs of recovery. Immediate resistance lies at $0.67. Short term indicators support momentum building. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart Tezos (XTZ) is trading around $0.6319, up 9.02% after a significant recovery from last week’s deep losses. The daily candle for October 12 shows renewed buying strength, pushing price above the lower Bollinger band at $0.5931. The mid-band resistance at $0.6745 is now the next hurdle for continuation. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD histogram shows fading bearish momentum. OBV has also started turning up slightly, suggesting that buyers are beginning to accumulate again after the recent capitulation move. If Tezos manages a daily close above $0.64–$0.65, continuation toward $0.67–$0.68 becomes likely. However, a rejection from this area could see price retreat back to $0.59, where short-term support now sits. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Tezos is showing gradual upward momentum, currently holding near $0.637. The Alligator lines have begun to realign positively, with the green line curling above the red and closing the gap with the blue base , a sign of an early trend shift. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The RSI sits around 52, reflecting modest bullish momentum and room for further gains before becoming overbought. Volume remains steady, confirming that buyers are gradually regaining control. The immediate resistance lies at $0.65–$0.67, where the upper Alligator band and prior breakdown zone align. A breakout above this range could propel price toward $0.70. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6633 SELL SMA 5 $0.6829 SELL SMA 10 $0.7129 SELL SMA 21 $0.6991 SELL SMA 50 $0.7227 SELL SMA 100 $0.7511 SELL SMA 200 $0.7064 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6978 SELL EMA 5 $0.7115 SELL EMA 10 $0.7359 SELL EMA 21 $0.7666 SELL EMA 50 $0.7677 SELL EMA 100 $0.7367 SELL EMA 200 $0.7435 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos has bounced strongly from oversold conditions, showing early signs of stabilization. The key test now sits at $0.67, and a break above this level would confirm a short-term bullish reversal. Until that happens, upside potential remains limited, and traders should watch the $0.60 support zone to gauge the strength of the recovery. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coingecko Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite its partnership milestones, Tezos (XTZ) had a bearish 2024. The coin peaked at $1.4 in April but dropped about 60% by August. Buyers returned in September, driving the price to $0.7015, and momentum carried into November with a peak of $1.856. The rally extended to December, when XTZ reached $1.909 before corrections brought the year-end close to $1.286. XTZ peaked at $1.49 in January 2025 before dropping to an average of $0.72 in February. From March to May, it consolidated below $0.70 with an overall average of $0.66. In June, it traded between $0.4752 and $0.6362, while July averaged $0.7232. August opened at $0.7605 and averaged $0.8212.

According to release notes shared by Bitcoin Core, the update brings performance improvements and bug fixes. However, many devs and Bitcoin supporters are opposing an update to OP_RETURN, which lets users attach data of up to 100,000 bytes (100KB) instead of the previous 83 byte limit. What are the major changes in Bitcoin Core v30.0? One of the major updates in Bitcoin Core is lower default fees. Nodes can relay transactions between peers with fees as low as 0.1 sat/vB. Miners, on the other hand, will be able to include transactions in the next block with a minimum fee of 0.001 sat/vB. OP_RETURN, which lets Bitcoin users attach data, like special messages, has more room to attach data, from 83 bytes to 100KB. OP_RETURN has multiple outputs instead of the previous single output. The increase in data limit lets users attach hashes, certificates, or even art metadata. Moreover, Bitcoin Core v30.0 no longer supports BDB wallets. Users must migrate to descriptor wallets, which are safer and easier to back up. Wallet commands such as importwallet and dumpwallet are also gone . The update also brings TRUC transactions, which avoid transaction conflicts while they wait for confirmation. Another new command is bitcoin, which simplifies how node operators and miners interact with Bitcoin Core. Also , typing bitcoin node, bitcoin gui, or bitcoin rpc replaces multiple older commands. Miners can connect directly to Bitcoin Core with an experimental PC Mining Interface, which works through local sockets, making block template requests faster . The graphical user interface (GUI) received multiple updates as well . The graphical toolkit was updated from Qt5 to Qt6 . Dark mode for Windows users is now supported, and on macOS, the Metal graphics are available for smoother performance. Other updates include fixing five low-severity bugs. The full details of bug fixes will be released within two weeks. Any node operating Bitcoin Core v27.x will no longer receive newer updates since v27.x is now labeled “End of Life” according to release notes from Bitcoin Core. What’s the controversy about Core v30.0? The increase of OP_RETURN’s data limit from 83 bytes to 100,000 bytes (100KB) received heavy criticism from developers and Bitcoin supporters. As mentioned above, OP_RETURN now lets users attach more data and allows multiple OP_RETURN outputs in one transaction. The Bitcoin Knots community, led by developer Luke Dashjr and Bitcoin Mechanic, opposed the new changes to OP_RETURN. They argued that increasing the data limit could force node operators to host illegal or harmful content, such as explicit material or malicious code. This could pose legal issues for node operators. The Knots community believes that Bitcoin should focus on money transfer, not file storage. In contrast, Bitcoin Core developers say the changes only adjust the memory pool (mempool) policy. It will not affect Bitcoin’s consensus rules. In September, Bitcoin Core developers planned to deprecate user control over the OP_RETURN data limit. That would have forced node operators to accept higher data limits without the option to reduce them. After backlash, Core maintainer Ava Chow restored user configurability over the data limits just before the October release window. The decision temporarily ended fears of forced settings. But the feature could be implemented in future versions. The update also changed how the -datacarriersize setting works. In older versions, a number like 83 represented an 83-byte limit, but in v30 the same value allows 9x more data. Critics say this silent change misleads users. For now, v30 keeps the new 100 KB default while still letting users manually lower it. Is Bitcoin going to fork? In late September, leaked messages suggested that Luke Dashjr might consider a temporary hard fork of Bitcoin to resist the new OP_RETURN data limit changes. TheRage claimed Dashjr was exploring a fork to protect node operators from potentially illegal data spreading through the network. But Dashjr denied the claims, calling the reports “fake news.” He said he was not planning any fork and that “there is no hard fork.” Still, he maintained his opposition to the new rules and accused “Core30 apologists” of being the only ones proposing forks. TheRage publication stood by its reporting, pointing out that neither Dashjr nor his colleagues disputed the authenticity of the leaked messages.

His remarks came after Ethena Labs’ synthetic dollar, USDe , briefly depegged amid the most severe liquidation cascade in the digital asset market’s history, which was triggered by President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs on Chinese imports on October 10. In a post on X , Ardoino declared that “USDT is the best collateral for derivatives and margin trading. Liquid, tested by fire.” He added, in characteristic flair, that those using “low liquidity tokens, some bananas, a horse, 3 olives and a chewed bubblegum” as collateral should “brace yourself when the market moves.” USDe’s flash depeg exposes structural fragility Ethena Labs’ USDe, a $14 billion “synthetic” stablecoin ranked third by market capitalization, was among the hardest hit in the midst of the crisis. USDe maintains its dollar peg through a derivatives-based hedging structure that combines spot crypto holdings with offsetting short futures positions, which is very different from Tether’s USDT or Circle’s USDC, both fiat-backed by cash and Treasury reserves. Comparison of USDe’s dollar peg on Curve and Binance. Source: Guy Young ( @gdog97_ ) on X During the turmoil, USDe’s price on Binance plunged as low as $0.65 following what Ethena described as an internal pricing discrepancy in the exchange’s spot market. On-chain liquidity pools such as Curve, Fluid, and Uniswap, by contrast, showed only minor deviations, which weren’t up to 30 basis points, similar to spreads between USDC and USDT. Binance’s degraded performance exacerbated the dislocation. It affected BNSOL, the Binance-issued Solana liquid staking token, and WBETH, the wrapped Beacon liquid staking token. According to Guy Young , Ethena Labs founder, Ethena’s mint and redeem function processed “more than $1b in a few hours and $2b in a 24-hour period with zero issues.” Young post on X implied that the depeg was a Binance-specific glitch rather than a structural failure of USDe itself. He proposed improved oracle designs to prevent forced liquidations during short-lived price distortions and suggested that pegging to USDT rather than USD during periods of stress could have mitigated the incident. Binance’s chief executive officer, Richard Teng, later apologized for the performance of the platform and its impact on users during the heat of Friday’s market capitulation and promised to compensate affected users, acknowledging that “there are no excuses” for its performance during the event. Tether touts durability as rivals stumble For Ardoino, the incident provided an opportunity to contrast USDT with other players in the market. USDT, now with more than $179 billion in circulation, weathered the rout without deviation, a fact Ardoino was quick to highlight. His post fits within an effort to position Tether as crypto’s foundational layer of liquidity and reliability, following years of scrutiny over its reserves and transparency. Ardoino has made a point of emphasizing Tether’s conservative asset management and swift redemption record, describing the token as battle-tested. His comment on the other low-liquidity tokens is quite sardonic; however, the market appears to have validated his claim. After the crash: lessons in collateral and design The October 10 event has already entered crypto lore as the “Tariff Crash,” both for its geopolitical trigger and for the staggering $19 billion in forced liquidations it produced, the largest in digital asset history. Analysts say the sell-off exposed how heavily the market still depends on leverage and centralized pricing feeds. Ethena’s measured handling of redemptions earned it cautious praise from some investors, but the episode highlighted how even sophisticated hedging systems remain vulnerable to exchange-specific distortions. Calls are growing for decentralized oracles that derive prices from deep-liquidity pools rather than individual venues and for real-time proof-of-collateral monitoring to identify early signs of stress.

The Russian media outlet RBC reported that domestic industry insiders say the blockchain-powered solution would be “feasible and attractive to foreign investors.” Vladimir Chistyukhin, the First Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, spoke about the matter on the sidelines of a recent financial forum. When asked about the tokenization of Russian shares, the Central Bank executive responded with a positive response, calling it a “possible option.” Vladimir Chistyukhin, the First Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Central Bank. (Source: MGIMO/YouTube/Screenshot) Russia’s Central Bank: Tokenization Could Help Firms Evade Sanctions However, Chistyukhin suggested that overseas players would need to provide technical and platform-based solutions. He said: “In this area, foreign partners will be playing a significant role. I am talking about the foreign entities who are willing to tokenize Russian assets in order to buy and sell them abroad.” Chistyukhin’s comments come hot on the heels of a proposal from Sergei Shvetsov, the head of the Moscow Exchange’s Supervisory Board. In late September this year, Shvetsov said that overseas investors want to buy Russian shares. And he said that tokenization would help them do so, as the solution does not make use of “sanctioned infrastructure.” Shvetsov went on to explain that decision-makers in Moscow have been openly talking about the tokenization of Russian shares. The exchange appears to believe that traditional finance-powered solutions tend to make use of “sanctioned infrastructure and sanctioned intermediaries and brokers.” These, he said, were “unfortunately common in Russia today.” Tokenization, he added, was one of several possible workarounds under consideration. Russian Experts Back Plans RBC quoted an official from the Russian banking group Sovcombank as voicing support for the plan. The Sovcombank official said that tokenization “could become a suitable tool for investors” from investors in BRICS countries or “friendly jurisdictions like the UAE, Kazakhstan, or Armenia.” Sovcombank offices in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Gennady Grachev [CC BY 2.0]) In the long term, the official added, tokenization could “accelerate the Russian market’s integration into the global digital financial system.” Alexey Korolenko, the Executive Director of Cifra Markets, concurred. He said that tokenization would allow traders with limited capital to buy fractions of stocks with a high market value per share. Korolenko added that the real-world assets (RWAs) sector is now going “mainstream,” and is now “in high demand among investors.” He concluded that the idea of tokenizing Russian shares was “entirely feasible.” But Korolenko warned that Moscow must ensure that providers meet reliability requirements “for the entire ownership and tokenization chain.” Experts also said regulators would need to consider infrastructure and liquidity matters, as well as possible “political risks.” The post Russia’s Central Bank: Tokenization Will Let Foreigners Buy Domestic Shares appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Russia|Tokenization,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|FIAT|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-12 23:30:00

The AI startup is taking on rivals like Meta and Google in developing next-generation AI that goes beyond text-based tools like ChatGPT or Grok. These models use data from videos and robots to learn how the real world behaves and could reshape how AI interacts with reality. Two people familiar with xAI’s work reportedly said the company plans to use these world models in gaming, building fully interactive 3D environments that respond like real spaces. Also, the same systems could later power AI robots, training them to move and react naturally. The company’s latest hires from Nvidia bring deep expertise in this area, making xAI a direct competitor in one of the most advanced AI fields yet. xAI strengthens team with Nvidia researchers to expand gaming and robotics goals xAI recruited Zeeshan Patel and Ethan He, two Nvidia researchers with experience developing simulation-based AI. Nvidia has long led the charge with its Omniverse platform, which allows developers to create detailed, physics-based simulations. Some technology companies believe world models could eventually transform AI into something that functions across both digital and physical products, including humanoid robots. Nvidia recently told the Financial Times that the potential global market for world models could reach the size of the entire world economy. That’s the scale of ambition now driving this technology. Elon said on X that xAI plans to launch an AI-generated game before the end of next year, confirming a goal he first mentioned in 2024. The announcement sets a clear timeline for xAI’s gaming ambitions, tying together Musk’s push to merge simulation, creativity, and real-world interaction. This week, xAI released a new image and video generation model with what it called “massive upgrades,” available for free. The company said the model creates sharper videos with more natural motion. Unlike current systems like OpenAI’s Sora, which predicts frames from learned image data, world models are built to understand cause and effect – how gravity, objects, and space work in real time. This allows them to generate realistic movement and physics instead of just visuals. xAI launches hiring spree and doubles down on real-world AI training To expand its work, xAI is hiring technical staff for its “omni team,” which focuses on image, video, and audio generation. Job listings describe it as building AI experiences beyond text, including multimedia creation. The positions pay between $180,000 and $440,000 per year, depending on seniority. There’s also a job posting for a “video games tutor,” who will train Grok to produce and design video games. That role pays $45 to $100 per hour, aimed at helping users explore AI-assisted game creation. Elon joins Meta and Google in pushing toward world models, but the challenge remains steep. Training AI to replicate the real world requires massive datasets (footage, physics data, and 3D mapping) all of which are costly to gather and process. Even with access to Nvidia hardware and talent, xAI faces technical and financial hurdles to scale these systems effectively. Not everyone in the gaming world is convinced. Michael Douse, publishing head at Larian Studios, the developer behind Baldur’s Gate 3 , wrote on X that AI won’t solve the game industry’s “big problem,” which he said is about “leadership and vision.” He added that the sector doesn’t need “more mathematically produced, psychologically trained gameplay loops,” but rather “expressions of worlds that people are actually engaged with or want to engage with.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Tech|Elon Musk|xAI,EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-12 23:40:06
53059784,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=834486,1760313538,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53059784.jpeg,Binance shells out $283 after token depegs rock market,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/binance-shells-out-283-after-token-depegs/,"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it has reimbursed customers for a total of $283 million after a volatile Friday, during which several tokens on the exchange depegged or experienced unnatural price crashes. The compensatory measure was taken in the midst of the worst-ever single-day liquidation, which erased around $20 billion worth of leveraged exposure and sent shivers throughout the digital asset space. According to Binance customers, many altcoins dropped to $0 on Friday’s pullback, a trend observed across the entire trading platform. This event, which included IoTeX (IOTX), Cosmos (ATOM), and Enjin, caused widespread panic. However, Binance has ascertained that this was just a display glitch. In a Sunday statement, Binance explained that the incident was caused by a “display issue” in its trading interface. According to the exchange, recent updates to the trading pairs, such as IOTX/USDT, had reduced the number of decimal places allowed for minimum price movements. This change caused the platform’s system to display a $0 price when token values were too small to render correctly. “Certain trading pairs, such as IOTX/USDT, recently reduced the number of decimal places allowed for minimum price movement, causing the displayed prices in the user interface to be zero, which is a display issue and not due to an actual $0 price.” The explanation helped calm fears after screenshots of zero-value tokens flooded social media, adding to the panic during an already chaotic market downturn. Depegged tokens trigger Binance’s compensation effort Adding to the turbulence, three Binance Earn assets —Ethena’s synthetic dollar (USDe), Binance Solana liquid staking token (BNSOL), and Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH)—temporarily depegged from their intended prices. Ethena’s USDe, meant to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar, briefly dropped to $0.66 on Binance. The exchange said it has fully compensated users who were affected between 21:36 and 22:16 UTC on October 10. This includes traders using USDe, BNSOL, or WBETH as collateral in futures, margin, and loan markets, as well as users who suffered verified losses through Earn redemptions or internal transfers. Ethena Labs CEO Guy Young pushed back against claims that USDe had officially depegged, noting that the incident was confined to Binance. “It is not accurate to describe this as a USDe depeg when a single venue was out of line with the deepest pools of liquidity that experienced no abnormal price deviations whatsoever,” Young wrote on X. Speculation mounts over possible exploit as Binance denies external attack Amid the confusion, some market observers speculated that a coordinated exploit had targeted Binance. A trader known as ElonTrades suggested that attackers may have exploited Binance’s Unified Account feature, which utilizes internal order-book data rather than external oracle feeds. This design difference, according to the theory, created a vulnerability that could be manipulated to produce sudden price discrepancies. ElonTrades claimed the exploit triggered a cascade of liquidations on Binance, eventually spilling over to the broader market. However, Binance denied any evidence of an external attack, stating that “the extreme market downturn occurred before the depegging.” To address future risks, Binance said it would update its reference index by including asset redemption prices and introducing a soft price floor for USDe. These measures are designed to stabilize future trading activity during extreme volatility. Renewed scrutiny spurs calls for stricter oversight of centralized exchanges The chaos has renewed calls for greater transparency and oversight in centralized exchanges. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek publicly urged regulators to investigate the cause of the extreme price swings, arguing that such events undermine confidence in centralized trading platforms. Marszalek said centralized exchanges must ensure that retail investors are protected from technical and structural failures, emphasizing the need for consistent regulatory standards. Despite the turbulence, crypto markets staged a notable recovery over the weekend. BNB, Binance’s native token, rallied more than 11% in 24 hours, while The Block’s GM30 Index, which tracks the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, rose 6.8%. In a statement, Binance emphasized that it is still “reviewing and handling user cases” related to the depegging and liquidation events. The exchange also pledged to reinforce infrastructure resiliency, work on transparency, and continue to provide customers with confidence following one of the most turbulent events in recent crypto history. Having already paid out damages of $283 million to impacted clients, Binance is attempting to demonstrate that it can respond quickly in the wake of a crisis and provide reassurance to customers while proving its resilience amid fast-paced market changes.

With a price of $0.00014574, over 31 billion tokens already sold, 2,800+ holders, and $860K+ raised, it’s more than just hype; it’s traction. At the heart of its momentum is the staggering ROI potential. Based on its listing target of $0.00527141, early buyers stand to gain over 3500% if projections hold. This isn’t a pipe dream. The economics are clear, and the math adds up. What makes BullZilla ($BZIL) crypto presale stand out is its stage-based growth model. Stage 6B, currently live, locks in investors at an ideal entry. With every presale phase, token scarcity increases, which historically drives prices higher on launch. Beyond the tokenomics, BullZilla’s branding is designed to resonate with meme coin lovers but grounded enough to appeal to analysts and devs. The green candles? They’re only part of the story. It’s also backed by liquidity plans, audited contracts, and a roadmap loaded with DeFi integrations. If there’s a top crypto to join now that could break out meme-style while offering institutional-grade structure, this is it. 2. Chainlink (LINK): The Backbone of Smart Contract Infrastructure Chainlink has moved from a niche oracle provider to a pillar of Web3 infrastructure. As smart contracts evolve, they need reliable data feeds — and that’s where LINK thrives. Chainlink’s value lies in its real-world adoption. It’s being integrated into DeFi, insurance, gaming, and even TradFi sectors. With the recent launch of Chainlink CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol), it’s poised to be the bridge between blockchains and traditional financial systems. While not a presale, LINK offers stability and long-term upside. Analysts from Messari and IntoTheBlock have consistently rated LINK as undervalued based on on-chain metrics and network activity. Though it may not offer 3500% upside like BZIL, LINK provides a lower-risk entry into infrastructure investing. For students and financial analysts looking for tech-backed plays, Chainlink remains a strong bet. 3. MoonBull (MOBU): The Staking Revolution That Rewards Conviction MoonBull is turning heads by merging meme coin enthusiasm with DeFi mechanics that reward holding. Its 23-stage scarcity model creates deflationary pressure, while its Ethereum foundation ensures security. But where MoonBull truly innovates is in its staking rewards — up to 95% APY through its AI-based optimizer. This tool adjusts rewards in real-time based on market volatility, giving holders consistent earnings without active management. The presale structure supports value growth, reinforced by instant referral bonuses and permanently locked liquidity. As the best upcoming crypto to join in 2025, MoonBull is building something deeper than memes. It’s a hybrid, part entertainment, part yield-generating machine. For devs and analysts, the real hook is its verified smart contract and upcoming cross-chain staking. This project doesn’t just want hype: it wants utility, governance, and global adoption. 4. La Culex (CULEX): The Meme Coin Built on Smart Tokenomics La Culex (CULEX) is an upcoming meme coin project. With a max supply of 200B and 45% allocated to presale, its tokenomics are built for sustained value appreciation. Its presale structure splits tokens across 32 phases. Each completed stage makes the token rarer, pushing its price closer to a $0.007 listing target. That’s an exponential opportunity for early buyers. Add to that an 80% APY via the Hive Vault, and a 12% referral bonus through the Bite Chain, and La Culex becomes a community-driven ecosystem with real rewards. With no transaction tax, locked liquidity, and audited contracts, it’s ticking all the boxes for safety. For anyone asking which top crypto to join now, La Culex offers a unique upcoming meme token with built-in longevity and growth. 5. Ethereum (ETH): The King That Keeps Evolving No serious list is complete without Ethereum. It’s the Layer-1 backbone of DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and more. But what keeps ETH attractive in 2025 is its shift to proof-of-stake, which drastically reduced its energy usage and circulating supply. ETH staking is now mainstream, and the introduction of L2s like Optimism and Arbitrum is solving the scalability problem of ETH. According to Glassnode, ETH’s staking deposits are at an all-time high, showing confidence in its long-term potential. ETH may not 50x from here, but it’s the reserve asset of Web3. For analysts and developers, ETH offers both innovation and stability. It’s a slow burner, not a moonshot, but one with fundamental strength. Conclusion: The Window of Opportunity Is Narrowing For those wondering which top crypto to join now, the answer is increasingly evident. BullZilla ($BZIL) isn’t just gaining traction, it’s racing ahead. With over $860K raised, a presale structure that rewards early adopters, and a projected 3500% ROI, it offers a rare combination of meme coin energy and solid fundamentals. Yet, it’s not alone. MoonBull and La Culex are pushing boundaries with staking innovations and community-first tokenomics. Chainlink and Ethereum, while more established, continue to be pillars of long-term growth. Whether you’re chasing the next breakout or building a diversified portfolio, these five projects represent the sharpest edges of the crypto frontier. The timing? Now. Because in a space that moves this fast, waiting often costs more than acting early.

53060482,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=834490,1760314765,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53060482.jpeg,Singapore to keep policy steady as inflation cools,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/singapore-to-keep-policy-steady/,"Singapore’s central bank is likely to hold monetary policy steady this week, citing low inflation and ongoing US trade uncertainties, while domestic growth remains stable. A recent survey revealed that 16 out of 20 economists anticipate the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will maintain its current policy settings. On the other hand, four economists, including some from DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and TD Securities, speculate that the bank might begin easing its policy again after maintaining it unchanged during its final review in July. Central banks adopt different strategies to support their country’s economic growth The MAS carefully reviews its policy four times annually. In January and April, the agency loosened its policy setting to support the country’s uncertain economic status, as it encountered slowdowns and risks that required cautious navigation. Unlike most central banks , which prefer adjusting interest rates in the event of growing uncertainties, Singapore’s central bank’s main aim is to stabilize prices by controlling the rise of its dollar based on trade. This act follows the central banks’ new decision to adopt different operational strategies. To support this claim, reliable sources report that Indonesia and New Zealand are further reducing their interest rates to enhance the countries’ economic growth. At the same time, Thailand, Malaysia, and Australia keep their rates steady as they thoroughly examine the impacts of previous changes. The US Federal Reserve, on the other hand, had earlier lowered borrowing costs for the first time since December last year. Concerning the situation, Lloyd Chan, a Senior Currency Analyst at MUFG’s Global Markets Research in Singapore, commented that the central bank appears to be holding off on any additional action until it identifies any signs of economic decline. Escalating trade tensions between the US and China also shape Singapore’s policy outlook. The US-China trade conflict has escalated as Beijing retaliates to US tariff policies with restrictions on the exports of rare-earth minerals. Regarding the US’s tariff policies, US President Donald Trump made public his intentions to impose additional tariffs and set up limitations on software sales to China. With this escalation, companies are getting ready for any potential interruption. China’s commerce ministry blamed Washington for raising trade tensions between the two countries after Trump announced on Friday that he would impose additional tariffs on China’s exports to the US, along with new controls on critical software, by November 1 . “Wilful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China,” a spokesperson for the commerce ministry said on Sunday, according to the state news agency Xinhua. “China’s position on the trade war is consistent. We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it. According to the spokesperson, while China does not seek a trade war, it will defend its interests if the US continues down this path. US stock index increased, signaling a breather after the worst dip since April, as Trump’s administration signaled openness to a trade deal following tensions between Washington and Beijing that shot up last week. Contracts on the S&P 500 advanced 0.9% as of 7:01 p.m. in New York, while Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.2%. After trade tensions between the world’s two leading economies began on Friday and over the weekend, US Vice President JD Vance told Beijing to “choose the path of reason,” threatening that Trump has more leverage if the fight does not come to an end. Singapore’s economy demonstrates signs of recovery, boosting the Singapore dollar Despite growing tension in the market, analysts have highlighted some bright spots in Singapore’s economy. To illustrate this, consumer spending grew more than expected in August and manufacturing activity increased to 56.4 last month, marking its eighth month of significant growth. Aditionally, private home prices posted their largest gain in three quarters, led by a jump in sales of new apartments. This rise and growing interest in safe regional investments have boosted the Singapore dollar. While it has gained more than 5% against the US dollar this year, it has remained relatively stable since MAS’s last decision at the end of July. However, Singapore’s core inflation continued to decline in August for the second month in a row. Concerning this, officials upheld the belief that price increases of imported goods will remain moderate soon. Afterwards, they forecasted that the core inflation will average between 0.5% and 1.5% this year.

New findings from Alvarez & Marsal show that the Trump administration’s deregulation drive will open up nearly $2.6 trillion in new lending power for U.S. banks. The rollback of post-crisis capital rules, those designed after the Great Recession in 2008, is expected to free $140 billion in locked capital for America’s biggest lenders, setting off pressure on regulators in Europe and Asia to reconsider their own limits. Since Donald Trump returned to the White House nine months ago, U.S. regulators have eased constraints that once forced banks to maintain large loss-absorbing buffers. The updated rules will strengthen the position of many Wall Street giants, allowing them to channel more money into AI, data centers, and energy infrastructure while also boosting shareholder payouts. The policy reversal will benefit the largest financial institutions far more than regional banks struggling with credit costs and liquidity tightening. Trump’s deregulation drive unlocks massive lending firepower Fernando de la Mora, co-head of financial services at Alvarez & Marsal, said Trump is “kicking off a major wave of deregulation, unlocking a huge amount of capacity, which will give a massive economic boost and an earnings uplift.” The consultancy’s data shows a 14% cut in common equity tier one capital requirements for American banks, a rule that dictates how much equity must be held against losses. That reduction alone could lift earnings per share by 35% and returns on tangible common equity by 6%, helping banks scale credit and push deeper into high-yield markets like crypto and AI financing. The full report details how similar deregulation might ripple through other markets, as the U.K. is expected to trim bank capital requirements by 8%, likely to preserve competitiveness with the U.S. But EU regulators are taking a different path, preparing to raise requirements by 1%, while Switzerland is set for an even bigger jump of up to 33%. The Swiss proposal could force UBS to raise $26 billion in fresh capital after rescuing Credit Suisse, a move aimed at preventing another financial shock. “This is going to drive a further market share gain by U.S. banks,” de la Mora added, saying U.K. banks would maintain ground while Swiss and EU lenders lose momentum. With looser restrictions and billions in freed-up funds, Wall Street is positioned to outpace global rivals as the balance tilts back toward U.S. dominance. Federal Reserve and regulators back easing despite global concern JPMorgan Chase will likely see the biggest payoff, with an estimated $39 billion in capital released from its balance sheet. That will raise its earnings per share by 31% and its return on equity by 7%, giving it extra flexibility to lend and invest. Within Washington, Michelle Bowman, newly appointed vice-chair of supervision at the Federal Reserve, has been one of the loudest voices for loosening capital rules. She has criticized the strict standards of the past decade, arguing they “pushed lending into private credit markets” and reduced traditional banking activity. Regulators have already outlined plans to relax requirements for banks to hold fixed levels of high-quality capital relative to total assets. They also intend to change the extra capital buffers for the biggest banks and redesign the annual stress tests that limit risk-taking. Huw van Steenis, vice-chair of Oliver Wyman, said, “There is a capital investment boom in the U.S. to be financed — for AI, data centers, energy infrastructure and some reshoring. This recalibration of regulation will help banks lean into this financing wave.” His comment reflects the private sector’s anticipation of a massive credit expansion as the rules ease. But not everyone is on board. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, warned against a “regulatory rollback” that could endanger financial stability. Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, added that regulators must avoid “the baby being thrown out with the bathwater” as they adjust oversight. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

However, while Solana’s momentum shines so bright, investors are questioning how high the rally will be able to reach, specifically as new projects are already promising much larger potential upsurges. None is better compared to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , the DeFi rising-star project presale currently under Phase 6, valued only at $0.035. The DeFi dual-lending protocol platform presented by Mutuum Finance gives users the capability to gain yields under a safer, streamlined ecosystem. With an estimated $1 potential growth by 2026 by the experts, early investors believe MUTM is the next-gen DeFi token capable of rivaling, if not surging past, Solana’s early growth curve. Solana Eyes the Next Move Up to $300 Solana (SOL) seems to be riding on past glory having finished a five-wave upswing from the September lows opting instead for the onset of healthy corrective correction. Presently commentators are speculating on two probable outcomes, namely SOL runs into the $214–$208 buying area only to reel off later toward the subsequent rally leg, or ends early and takes off straight into the subsequent rally leg. In either case, market configuration is bullish for continued movement to the bullish side, with analysts speculating on a breakout that will ultimately take SOL up to the $300 level sometime in the next few weeks. But for investors aiming for diversification into promising projects, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), one emerging DeFi performer is making strong strides. Mutuum Finance Presale Hype Gains Steam Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investor attention this week following tremendous speed in Phase 6 of presale. The tokens are currently valued at $0.035, up by a 16.17% increment from the previous round. Over 16,860 investors have already purchased generating over $17.25 million, healthfully depicting an emerging market confidence in the bright DeFi future of Mutuum Finance. With over 60% sold in Phase 6, early investors are acquiring their buy-ins before the next increment. A second cushion is offered by the shape of the reserve multiplier configuration, itself apportioned from 10% for small risk projects to 35% for high risk projects. The configuration underpins system resilience, dampens liquidation shocks, and insulates capital integrity. Even the collateral management is optimized, for eventual ultimate power-to-borrow by mutual complementing leveraging off the related holdings, with the ultimate bankruptcy risk elimination and overall platform health. Real-Time Data Through Chainlink Oracles For precise, stable pricing alongside risk calculation, Mutuum Finance is making use of Chainlink oracles for USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX feeds. Fallback oracles, advanced data feeds, and decentralized exchange TWAPs guarantee the valuation from the protocol remains precise even during record-record volatility or illiquid conditions. Mutuum’s lending and borrowing protocol is soon expected to go live. Version 1 (V1) is slated to come out on Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will have key components such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be provided at the launch for collaterals, lending, and borrowing and will give the users the efficient, scalable, and secure DeFi. The platform also provides floating-, fixed-, and floating/fixed-degree tools and balances the supply versus the demand for the liquids as well as stabilizes the ecosystem. Whereas Solana (SOL) is plotting a bullish continuation chart to $300, investors are setting their sights on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for even larger potential. At only $0.035 during Phase 6 of presale, more than 65% of the tokens have been sold so far, generating $17.25 million from more than 16,860 investors. By means of the dual-lending protocol on the Chain, oracle inclusion by Chainlink, and the reserve multiplier mechanism, the platform is providing tangible DeFi utility with great risk coverage. Analysts believe MUTM will reach $1 by 2026, including the token on their radar as the ultimate early-stage bet for the next crypto upcycle. Get on the Mutuum Finance presale today before Phase 6 closes.

In a statement dated October 13, the think tank noted that this reform is important because it will enable Reeves to collect more funds while minimizing the negative economic effects. Concerning the IFS’s advice to the chancellor, officials in the London-based research institute told Reeves not to increase the current tax rate to collect the extra funds she needs, which is approximately 30 billion pounds, equivalent to around $40 billion, to satisfy her goals for enhancing public finances. “What we really do not want in November is the encouragement of aimless changes and half-hearted solutions,” said Isaac Delestre, a senior research economist at the IFS. Delestre views November’s budget as a chance for real progress. Therefore, he urges the chancellor to use this budget to establish a more sensible tax system. Delestre urges Reeves to establish a more logical tax system Earlier, Reeves and Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, assured voters that they would not increase social security contributions, value-added tax , or income tax on employees. Additionally, they pledged not to raise the main tax on corporate profits. Last year, the UK chancellor increased social security costs for employers. However, after increasing these expenses, Reeves still has options to consider for the upcoming budget on November 26. This includes taxes on wealth and property. Regarding these considerations, the IFS pointed out that changing wealth-related taxes, such as capital gains tax, would be more impactful than adopting a new annual wealth tax. The think tank officials highlighted that they were aware some members of the ruling Labour Party opt for a new annual wealth tax. On the other hand, the IFS urged transferring local property tax responsibilities to regions like London for property-related taxes. According to the think tank, these regions have recently experienced increased house prices, and the relevant authorities have removed the stamp duty tax on property purchases. The leader of Britain’s opposition Conservative Party expressed their great support for eliminating the stamp tax last week. Apart from the IFS, another significant think tank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, commented on the topic of discussion. According to them, Reeves should focus on crucial matters, such as reassessing her earlier pledge not to increase employee taxes, rather than less important issues like finding effective methods to boost revenue. Think tank officials call on Reeves to stick to her earlier commitment Think tank officials call on Reeves to reconsider her earlier pledge not to raise taxes on working people because they believe this approach would be preferable to looking for other methods of raising revenue that could cause significant damage to the county’s economy. Following this, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research stated that alternative ways to raise the £30 billion, equivalent to approximately $40 billion, that Reeves will need are too disruptive to the economy. Meanwhile, in the UK, the government’s borrowing costs have risen more than expected. Moreover, a plan to save 5 billion pounds a year on welfare spending has been abandoned, and the country’s budget watchdog suggested that it might cut its growth forecasts. Still, Starmer and Reeves have repeatedly said for months that they are determined to honour their pre-election commitments, including at last month’s annual Labour Party conference. “A new wealth tax,” the NIESR added, citing a policy that some Labour lawmakers support, “is likely to reduce savings, increasing the cost of borrowing and discouraging investment.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",News|UK,EN,0,0,REGULATION|RESEARCH|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-13 01:44:55

Fully enacted in late 2024, MiCA set a harmonized regime for crypto asset providers across the 27-member bloc for the first time. No company was explicitly cited in the EBA statement. Still, it warned that attempts to circumvent these regulations could persist and carry substantial risks for the functioning of the EU’s financial system. EBA addresses several risks, including “forum shopping.” This refers to firms attempting to obtain regulatory approval in one country that they perceive as having less stringent approval mechanisms, so they can subsequently operate legally in other parts of the EU. This is also known as “ passporting .” According to the EBA report, before the adoption of MiCA , one unnamed entity submitted applications for registration and licensing in several states within a short timeframe. It further continued to withdraw from jurisdictions where authorities continuously probed or its application was challenged, before proceeding to operate in countries where it went unchallenged. EBA noted, “In practice, entities with weak AML/CFT controls have already entered and are operating in the EU market by selecting jurisdictions with lighter supervisory practices or previously lower market entry requirements.” MiCA transition period may allow unlicensed firms to continue operations While MiCA came fully into effect last year, it included a transition window that runs until July 1, 2026, giving firms some time to either get a license or be deemed non-compliant. According to the regulator, “emerging evidence suggests that there may be a risk that entities which were previously licensed in a Member State and have not met the authorisation conditions under MiCA but are appealing their case may continue to operate in the EU in the interim time.” Dr. Hendrik Müller-Lankow, a lawyer at the German crypto law firm Kronsteyn , states that, based on his experience, supervisory arbitrage and supervisory shopping are in fact occurring throughout the EU. He adds that this is a phenomenon regulators must accept if they want to establish a single market while still maintaining some level of supervisory authority. “It is well known that people—and thus also authorities—in different Member States have different mentalities when applying laws,” he added. Müller-Lankow believes the EU could tackle the issue by centralizing both its legislation and supervisory authorities. He noted much of this is already underway, and EU authorities are actively working to expand their powers. Lankow also highlighted that some crypto firms may be establishing themselves in the EU without transparent governance or clear beneficial ownership, making it difficult to determine accountability. Opaque structures in crypto firms heighten risk of illicit activity According to the EBA report, a virtual asset service provider, or VASP, that applied for an operating license in several EU jurisdictions was found by one crypto authority to “be jointly run by more than 20 distinct entities that were largely established outside the EU and outside regulatory oversight.” The EBA warns that such opaque structures may enable the misuse of front or shell companies. The independent EU agency added that entities that lack real economic activity can serve as drivers to channel illicit funds under the guise of legitimate transactions.” The EBA’s report highlights the continued difficulty faced by the EU in enforcing a common crypto regulatory framework. Although MiCA aims to provide the market with clarity and stability, areas of uncertainty and opaque corporate structures may persist. Regulators are facing increased pressure to intensify the regulation of crypto assets and enhance cooperation between member states, aiming to prevent digital tokens from being used for nefarious purposes, protect investors, and maintain the integrity of the EU financial system. With the transition phase extending into mid-2026, however, the next few months will be crucial in shaping MiCA’s potential to deliver on its promise of a fully harmonized and secure crypto market.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin is trading at $115,157, steady after a volatile weekend which began with the largest crypto liquidation event in history , while Ether rose to $4,146, extending its recovery from Friday’s lows near $3,700. Elsewhere, Solana gained 11% to $196, Bittensor surged 28%, and Cronos jumped 11%, according to CoinDesk market data, as capital rotated back into high-beta assets following a $20 billion leverage flush. Both Washington and Beijing worked to cool down trade tensions over the weekend , helping the recovery. Bitwise’s Jonathan Man points to positioning as the key factor: leverage was stretched across long-tail tokens, so when liquidity vanished, the wipeout was severe — but it cleared the decks for a faster reset. Staking also played a secondary role in cushioning the decline. With nearly 30% of ETH supply locked in validators but only a quarter of that circulating as liquid staking derivatives, the network’s structure created friction that slowed panic selling. Even as derivatives unwound, validator capital stayed put, blunting what could have been a full liquidity spiral. But as postmortems roll in, many fingers are pointing at Binance. Dragonfly's Haseeb Qureshi questions if Ethena really depegged, arguing that instead $60–$90 million in USDe, along with wBETH and BNSOL, was dumped on Binance, exploiting a pricing flaw that valued collateral using Binance’s own order book instead of external oracles. As Binance’s infrastructure buckled under heavy load, market makers were unable to hedge or rebalance positions, the thesis goes, causing wrapped assets to decouple from their underlying prices and deepening the selloff. The localized collapse drove USDe to $0.65 on Binance only, while it held near $1 on Curve and Bybit. Because Binance’s unified margin system marked collateral to its internal prices, the drop instantly wiped out hundreds of millions in margin value, triggering forced liquidations across assets. Ethena’s USDe protocol remained fully collateralized and redeemable throughout, suggesting the chaos was an exchange-side failure, not a stablecoin depeg. Binance has since acknowledged “platform-related issues,” moved to oracle-based collateral pricing, and pledged compensation for affected traders. In hindsight, Friday’s crash looks less like a stablecoin panic and more like a masterclass in exploiting an exchange's weakest structural link. In a post on X , Yi He, Binance's co-founder and chief customer service officer admitted that the exchange had brief service delays and temporary depegs in some yield products but said these occurred after the broader market drop. Binance added that over $280 million in compensation has already been paid to affected users and reaffirmed that it will not cover ordinary market losses. For now, crypto’s cleanout has given way to a measured rebound, one led by the assets that fell hardest and reset the deepest. Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin steadied around $115,000 after falling nearly 9% on Friday and recovering about 4% over the weekend as traders unwound shorts and broader risk sentiment began to stabilize. ETH: Ether rebounded to about $4,150 after dropping nearly 17% on Friday, recovering faster than Bitcoin as leveraged positions cleared and DeFi activity picked back up. Gold: Gold surged to a record $4,059.87 per ounce in early Asian trading on Monday as escalating U.S.–China trade tensions, renewed geopolitical risks, and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts fueled demand for safe-haven assets.

BTC is now struggling and might face hurdles near the $116,000 level. Bitcoin started a recovery wave above the $113,500 resistance level. The price is trading below $116,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $119,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down if it trades below the $113,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Starts Recovery Bitcoin price started a recovery wave after a massive liquidation event below $110,000. BTC recovered above the $111,500 and $112,000 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the sharp decline from the $123,750 swing high to the $100,000 low. The bulls even pushed the price above the $113,500 resistance level. However, there are many hurdles on the upside. Bitcoin is now trading below $116,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $119,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $116,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $116,250 level. The next resistance could be $118,000 and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the sharp decline from the $123,750 swing high to the $100,000 low. A close above the $118,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $119,500 resistance and the trend line. Any more gains might send the price toward the $120,000 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $122,500. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $116,000 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support is near the $114,000 level. The first major support is near the $113,500 level. The next support is now near the $113,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $112,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $110,500, below which BTC might struggle to recover in the short term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone.

Here’s the Sign,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-your-xrp-moment-is-near-heres-the-sign/,"Amonyx (@amonbuy), a well-known crypto commentator, recently posted on X that XRP’s moment could be near. His remark came in response to an analysis by XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) that compares XRP’s current market structure to its historical movement in 2017 and 2018. The suggestion is that XRP may be repeating a technical pattern that previously led to a sharp upward move. The timing and framing of Amonyx’s post immediately caught the interest of market watchers, as the historical data presented implies that XRP could soon experience a sharp upward move. His statement hinted at renewed optimism for the token’s medium-term trajectory, especially as the digital asset consolidates near major support zones . This tweet is a sign — your $XRP moment is near https://t.co/dkgfSLfEIj — Amonyx (@amonbuy) October 11, 2025 Technical Parallels Between 2017 and 2025 In the analysis, XRPunkie noted that “there’s some similarity to what’s happening with $XRP back in 2017/2018 and today.” The chart he shared shows XRP on a weekly timeframe with exponential moving averages and a set of parallel trendlines extending across multiple years. The visual comparison highlights a recurring structure, showing a long wick testing the lowest trendline support, followed by a significant market recovery. In 2017, XRP experienced a sharp rebound after testing that same type of structural base. The current pattern, as illustrated in the 2025 section of the chart, appears to mirror that event, showing another deep wick toward lower support before potential continuation within the same ascending channel. The setup has led some traders to speculate that XRP could again follow a similar path upward, provided the support level holds. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Chart Interpretation and Potential Outcomes The chart projects possible future extensions using Fibonacci levels. Key markers appear at 9.1146 (Fib. 1.272), 15.0450 (Fib. 1.414), and 30.9 (Fib. 1.618). The highlighted green zone on the right side of the image suggests the range in which XRP could rally if price behavior mirrors the previous cycle. A yellow circle marks the current point of contact with the lower trendline, matching the trajectory observed in 2017 before XRP’s surge. This visual cue reinforces the notion that technical conditions may be aligning for a similar response. While the analysis stops short of confirming an imminent move, the historical correlation forms the basis of Amonyx’s confidence. At the time of the analysis, XRP traded at $2.39. The token has maintained a steady performance within its long-term channel despite fluctuations across the broader digital asset market. For traders following historical cycles, the similarity to 2017’s setup makes a compelling case for a rapid ascent in the short term.

The price is now showing positive signs but faces a major hurdle near the $2.60 level. XRP price is attempting a recovery wave above the $2.50 zone. The price is now trading below $2.60 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.660 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it settles below $2.70. XRP Price Starts Recovery XRP price found support and started a strong recovery wave above $2.0, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.20 and $2.25 levels to enter a positive zone. There was a decent increase above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low. However, the price could face hurdles near $2.60. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.660 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.60 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.60 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.660 level and the trend line. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low. A clear move above the $2.660 resistance might send the price toward the $2.70 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.720 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.80. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.60 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.450 level. The next major support is near the $2.40 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.40 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.320. The next major support sits near the $2.30 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.250. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.450 and $2.40.

Dash price has jumped by over 50% in the last 24 hours, while MNT, ASTER, and Morpho have risen by over 30%. Bitcoin price has also surged from last week’s low of $108,000 to $115,500 today. Crypto market rally happens amid trade optimism The primary reason why the crypto market rally is happening is the view that the trade war between the US and China will de-escalate soon. In a Truth Social post, Donald Trump asked market participants not to be worried about the potential trade war. His statement came shortly after JD Vance, the vice president, left the door open for de-escalation, noting that the US had more cards over China. These statements came two days after Donald Trump warned that the US would impose major tariffs against China. He said this after China unveiled new measures, including a threat to limit rare earth materials exports, new tariffs on US ships docking in its shores, and an investigation into Qualcomm. In a statement on Sunday, Beijing reiterated that its actions were a response to US policy. Just recently, the Trump administration tightened the screws on its export controls policy. Therefore, the two sides will likely work to reach a trade agreement ahead of the Trump and Xi Jinping meeting in South Korea. Crypto investors are buying the dip The ongoing crypto market rally is happening as investors buy the dip. This is evidenced by the ongoing volume and open interest surge. The volume in the spot market rose by 4.20% in the last 24 hours to over $262 billion. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that the open interest has jumped by almost 10% $162 billion, in the last 24 hours. Historically, cryptocurrencies bounce back sharply after a big drop as market participants buy the dip expecting that the rally will intensify. They also buy the dip as they aim to recoup some of their losses. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts hopes Bitcoin and altcoins are going up as investors predict that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting rates as the government shutdown continues and threats to the US economy remain. There are chances that the economy will remain under pressure in the coming weeks. For one, the Trump administration has started firing government workers as it increases its pressure on Democrats. A recent report by ADP noted that the economy lost over 36,000 jobs in September. While the BLS did not publish the official report, analysts believe that the labor market was not all that strong. As such, the odds of more rate cuts by the Fed have jumped, which will help to support the crypto market. Potential dead-cat bounce The biggest risk that the crypto market faces today is that the ongoing rally may be part of a dead-cat bounce or DCB. A DCB, also known a a bull trap, is a situation where a falling asset bounces back temporarily and then resumes the downtrend. Looking forward, the crypto market will likely be volatile as traders focus on the trade talks between the US and China, and the government shutdown.

We've probably all heard this phrase: ""Once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, three times is a pattern."" The old saying is perfectly applicable to the bitcoin (BTC) market, where the crash on Friday marked the third time bulls failed to maintain gains above the critical trendline drawn from the 2017 and 2021 highs, raising the possibility of a deeper drop to $100,000 or lower. This repeated inability to hold above that level highlights a persistent resistance, suggesting that the trendline is now a key battleground likely defining the limits of the bullish strength in this cycle. CoinDesk highlighted the trendline resistance a month ago, noting that bulls had twice failed to maintain gains above it. The long wicks on the July, August, and October candles signal bull fatigue above the trendline. At the same time, the MACD histogram on the monthly chart – although still positive – is lower than it was during the December-January rally when BTC first broke above $100,000, indicating a weakening of upward momentum. MACD, a moving average-based indicator, is widely used to identify trend changes and trend strength. The daily chart below also paints a bearish picture. The sharp reversal from the expanding channel resistance, combined with negative readings in both the standard (12, 26, 9) and longer-term (50, 100, 9) MACD histograms, signals that the path of least resistance is downward. The longer duration histogram, which uses 50- and 100-day EMAs and a 9-day EMA to smooth the signal, is significantly slower and less sensitive than the default setting, but better suited for filtering out short-term market noise. Taken together, the monthly and daily charts suggest scope for a drop to sub-$100K levels, marking a test of the lower end of the expanding triangle. On the way lower, the 200-day simple moving average at $107,000 could also offer support. Bulls will need to engineer a break above $121,800 to invalidate the series of lower highs and overturn the bearish outlook. At press time, BTC changed hands at $114,800, according to CoinDesk data.",Markets|Bitcoin|Technical Analysis|Markets|News,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-13 04:26:05

Trump struck a softer tone, calling President Xi Jinping “highly respected” and saying the US wanted to “help” rather than “hurt” China , despite friction over rare earth exports and looming tariff increases. Leverage Unwind Wiped Out Nearly $20B in Crypto Bets Markets had been reeling since Friday, when Trump’s announcement of an extra 100% tariffs on Chinese imports sparked a global sell-off. The sharp decline hit late Saturday, when Bitcoin fell below $110,000 and Ethereum tumbled more than 20% within hours. As risk assets slid, crypto traders faced mass liquidations amplified by thin liquidity and automated selling across platforms such as Binance, OKX and Bybit. Further, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index plummeted from 64 , signaling “greed,” to 27, indicating “fear,” in under a day. More than 1.6m traders were liquidated, with total losses surpassing $19.3b. Some estimates place the real figure closer to $30b, as certain exchanges only report one liquidation order per second. Crypto Fear and Greed Index crashed from 64 to 27 after Trump’s 100% tariff shock — over $19.33B liquidated and $1T erased from the market in three hours. More crash ahead? #Bitcoin #Ethereum https://t.co/ZPzP74ngrh — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 11, 2025 Fears of Escalating Trade War Cloud Outlook for Global Growth, Risk Assets Including Crypto The scale of the losses rivaled the May 2021 crash, when excessive leverage similarly fueled a rapid chain reaction of forced selling. Analysts said this latest event reflected the same structural vulnerabilities in crypto markets of high leverage, limited liquidity during off-hours and reflexive selling driven by algorithmic trades. Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said the real concern now lies in whether China retaliates. “The risk isn’t the tariffs themselves, it’s whether China responds with aggressive countermeasures,” he said. “A full-scale trade war between the world’s two largest economies would create substantial headwinds for global growth.” He added that trading patterns already indicate investors are moving toward safer positions, with signs of strain emerging across multiple asset classes. “Cryptocurrencies are under pressure, and the flight to Treasuries reflects genuine concerns about economic momentum,” Magadini said. For now, Trump’s remarks appear to have steadied sentiment. Crypto traders welcomed the signs of diplomatic outreach, even as volatility remains elevated.

A recent post from Dom (@traderview2) offered a vivid look at this phenomenon through a chart comparing Binance’s and Coinbase’s XRP spot markets. Both charts captured the same event in real time, showing a sharp liquidity disappearance that preceded XRP’s steep fall from above $2.8 to below $1.50. Liquidity Vanishes in Seconds The data in Dom’s post reveal a synchronized withdrawal of orders across major exchanges moments before the price cascade. The visual shows the order book depth within 50% of the quoted price contracting rapidly, leaving a thin market with few bids to absorb selling pressure. In practical terms, this means that as sell orders increased, the absence of nearby buy orders magnified the impact of each trade. Without adequate liquidity to cushion the descent, XRP’s price fell sharply across platforms, hitting a low point it has not reached since June . The TradingLite chart’s Orderbook Suite indicator clearly illustrates this imbalance, with a deep negative swing marking the point of collapse. Look at how quickly liquidity vanished on $XRP spot markets right before the massive part of the cascade Orderbook depth +/-50% of the quote price just gone This is a visualization of how these exact moves can happen… We can only speculate… pic.twitter.com/9icJa0btKf — Dom (@traderview2) October 11, 2025 A Fragile Market Structure Dom’s observation indicates high volatility during liquidity shocks, which is a core feature of modern digital asset markets. In spot markets like XRP’s, where price discovery occurs in real time, even a temporary reduction in resting orders can amplify moves that would otherwise remain contained. The synchronized behavior on Binance and Coinbase suggests that liquidity providers may have stepped back simultaneously, either through algorithmic withdrawal or automated protection triggers. This event also came at a crucial technical juncture for XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 After months of trading close to $3, the market had shown signs of fatigue near the $2.8 range, forming resistance as momentum slowed. When liquidity thinned, the sell-off accelerated. That breakdown signals a potential shift in market structure, as buyers who previously defended that threshold were unable to maintain support . What Comes Next for XRP? The recovery since the flash drop has been steady but limited, with prices fluctuating between roughly $2.30 and $2.50 in the following seasons. This consolidation reflects cautious re-entry from traders still assessing market depth after the event. If liquidity continues to rebuild and volume stabilizes, XRP could retest the $2.6 to $2.8 range where the decline began. However, if bid density remains low, volatility could persist, leaving the token vulnerable to renewed downward pressure.

53070973,https://nulltx.com/?p=152336,1760332655,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,BNB Chain Leads Global User Activity Across All Layer-1 Networks,https://nulltx.com/bnb-chain-leads-global-user-activity-across-all-layer-1-networks/,"BNB Chain is back at the top. The network continues to lead the Layer-1 ecosystem with 58.9 million monthly active users, one of its highest levels of onchain activity to date. The milestone, highlighted by @CryptoMiners_Co, cements BNB Chain’s position as the most-used blockchain among major L1s, well ahead of NEAR Protocol and Solana. According to data from Token Terminal, the top three active Layer-1s are: BNB Chain, 58.9M users NEAR Protocol, 50.3M users Solana, 37.3M users While other chains have had brief bursts of user activity tied to specific hype waves, BNB Chain’s growth has been consistent and organic, driven by strong user retention, scalable infrastructure, and a thriving developer community. BNB Chain’s Ecosystem Momentum The numbers tell a clear story, BNB Chain has become a gravity center for Web3 adoption. From gaming to DeFi to NFT marketplaces, activity across the network has surged through 2024 and into 2025. BNB Chain’s multi-sector reach is what gives it this edge. DeFi platforms like PancakeSwap, Venus, and Uniswap V3 (BNB) continue to post strong trading volumes, ensuring deep liquidity within the network. Meanwhile, the gaming sector has exploded, with over 1,500 active Web3 games running on BNB Chain. Popular titles such as X World Games, BinaryX, and SecondLive have drawn millions of players, contributing to the rise in daily transactions. This ecosystem strength reflects a pattern: users aren’t just visiting, they’re staying. BNB Chain’s retention metrics show sustained engagement across months, proving that the network’s activity isn’t inflated by temporary hype or airdrop farming. opBNB: The Layer-2 Accelerator One of the biggest growth catalysts behind this surge is opBNB, the Layer-2 scaling solution built on the Optimism OP Stack. Since its launch, opBNB has become the fastest-growing L2 in the BNB ecosystem, processing tens of millions of transactions monthly with gas fees averaging below $0.001. This cost efficiency, combined with full EVM compatibility, makes it a magnet for developers migrating from Ethereum and Polygon. The opBNB expansion has also attracted a new wave of DeFi and gaming projects aiming to leverage BNB’s liquidity depth with L2 scalability. Data from BNB Chain Explorer shows steady transaction growth across the last six months, a strong indicator of increasing adoption beyond speculative trading. Comparing the Competition BNB Chain’s 58.9M monthly users place it nearly 17% ahead of NEAR Protocol, which sits at 50.3M. NEAR has seen significant traction from consumer apps like Sweat Economy and Kai-Ching, but its ecosystem breadth still trails behind BNB’s multi-sector dominance. Solana, meanwhile, remains the third most active chain at 37.3M users, boosted by its DeFi and memecoin resurgence in mid-2025. However, Solana continues to face periodic network stress during peak traffic, a challenge BNB Chain’s multi-layer architecture has largely avoided. CoinMarketCap data shows BNB’s market cap hovering around $170 billion, maintaining its spot among the top four crypto assets globally. This strength reinforces BNB’s role as not just a blockchain, but a core pillar of the Web3 economy. Why BNB Chain Keeps Winning The secret behind BNB Chain’s dominance is a blend of user experience, affordability, and reach. Transaction fees remain some of the lowest among major L1s, averaging under $0.05 per transaction. Network uptime is near-perfect, and validator participation remains stable, even during market-wide volatility. In 2025, BNB Chain has also doubled down on its developer programs. The BNB Greenfield initiative, focused on decentralized storage, and opBNB’s ecosystem grants have attracted hundreds of projects, ensuring constant innovation. Beyond tech, Binance’s influence as an exchange ecosystem still plays a role. The direct integration of BNB Chain dApps within Binance Wallet and Web3 features has helped onboard millions of users seamlessly into onchain activity. It’s a loop that keeps growing: the exchange drives traffic to the chain, and the chain sustains user demand through real utility. Long-Term Sustainability The real story here isn’t just numbers, it’s resilience. BNB Chain has managed to grow through one of the most volatile market cycles in crypto history. From the meme coin boom on BNB to the rise of L2 solutions like opBNB, the network has evolved without breaking under congestion or cost pressure. That reliability has built trust among developers and retail users alike, ensuring that even when new L1s emerge, BNB Chain remains the default home for scalable Web3 deployment. This consistent expansion paints a picture of a network maturing beyond speculation, one that’s laying long-term infrastructure for consumer-level blockchain adoption. BNB Chain’s success story also stems from its community-first ethos. Through local hackathons, incubation programs, and the “Build the Future” campaign, BNB has built a culture that rewards creators, not just traders. The result? A self-sustaining flywheel of innovation. Developers build, users engage, and liquidity flows back into the ecosystem. That balance, between scalability and usability, is what continues to keep BNB Chain far ahead of the pack. BNB Chain’s Position in 2025 As of October 2025, BNB Chain isn’t just surviving the market cycle, it’s shaping it. While most chains battle retention issues or rely on external hype, BNB’s core ecosystem has stayed active and profitable. Its steady dominance in user activity, DeFi liquidity, and gaming engagement signals that BNB Chain has quietly become the benchmark for real Web3 traction. The network’s capacity to integrate scaling (opBNB), innovation (Greenfield), and adoption (Binance Wallet) makes it the most comprehensive blockchain stack in the current market. BNB Chain’s journey from a fast-trading chain to a multi-layer, multi-sector ecosystem shows how far it has come, and how much further it can go. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The decentralized derivatives platform recorded 100% uptime and zero bad debt, even as billions of dollars in positions were liquidated across the ecosystem. According to founder Jeff, this was the first time in over two years that Hyperliquid activated its cross-margin Auto-Deleveraging (ADL) mechanism, a key safeguard used only in extreme conditions. “During recent volatility, Hyperliquid had 100% uptime with zero bad debt,” Jeff wrote. “This was Hyperliquid’s first cross-margin ADL in more than two years of operation.” TLDR: During recent volatility, Hyperliquid had 100% uptime with zero bad debt. This was Hyperliquid’s first cross-margin ADL in more than 2 years of operation. ADL does not change the outcome for any liquidated users. While some specific ADL providing trades were unfavorable,… — jeff.hl (@chameleon_jeff) October 11, 2025 While some specific ADL trades were unfavorable, Jeff emphasized that, in aggregate, the mechanism allowed traders to capture substantial profits through brief favorable liquidations. Solvency and Uptime Take Center Stage Jeff addressed criticism directed toward Hyperliquid following the event, describing it as “sad” that some were attacking the platform to deflect from their own technical failures. “Solvency and uptime are the two most important properties of a financial system,” he said. “Gaslighting users to believe otherwise is unethical and irresponsible.” The founder reaffirmed that Hyperliquid’s design priorities, solvency, transparency, and fairness, are non-negotiable. Every trade, liquidation, and margin event remains verifiable onchain, offering a level of transparency that few competitors match. Liquidations and System Design When markets swing violently, liquidation systems are pushed to their limits. Jeff used the opportunity to explain how Hyperliquid’s margining system handled the chaos. In a perpetuals market, every position must be backed by a maintenance margin, the minimum collateral required to stay solvent. When the collateral falls short, the system takes over the position and liquidates it. Earlier in the day, many altcoins had dropped over 50% in minutes. That forced 2x-leveraged or higher long positions into liquidation. Hyperliquid’s transparent liquidation engine ensured that these liquidations were executed systematically to prevent bad debt. Billions of dollars in open interest were liquidated in under 20 minutes, all visible onchain. In a permissionless system, each trader manages their own leverage and collateralization. If a platform fails to liquidate undercollateralized users in time, it risks endangering everyone’s funds. Jeff pointed out that while other exchanges may underreport liquidation data, Hyperliquid’s full onchain visibility means “you see everything, the good, the bad, and the volatile.” HLP: The Backstop of Last Resort Central to Hyperliquid’s stability is HLP, a protocol vault with permissionless deposits. It serves two purposes, providing order book liquidity and performing backstop liquidations when the market cannot absorb all liquidations normally. While its market share in order book trading is negligible (less than 1%), its liquidation role is critical. Here’s how it works: If the order book lacks liquidity to close an undercollateralized position, HLP steps in. It takes over the position and its collateral. For risk management, HLP is split into multiple child vaults, with each liquidation assigned to one vault. This structure allows the system to isolate risk, ensuring that even when one vault absorbs heavy losses, others remain stable. The Role of Auto-Deleveraging (ADL) Auto-Deleveraging is the final safety mechanism, the “last resort” liquidation event that activates when both market and backstop systems are exhausted. Each ADL event has two sides: The triggered side, the undercollateralized position. The providing side, selected based on leverage and profitability. In most cases, ADL providers are profitable overall, but outcomes can vary per event. Some ADL trades perform poorly, especially when only part of a portfolio is closed. Jeff emphasized that Hyperliquid’s system minimizes ADL triggers because they are unpredictable, even if the average outcome benefits the market. This week’s activation marked the first cross-margin ADL on Hyperliquid mainnet since launch. In contrast, isolated assets such as hyperps see more frequent ADLs since they’re not backstopped by HLP. Inside the 20-Minute Liquidation Window Over roughly 20 minutes, HLP liquidated billions of dollars in positions as altcoins tumbled. HLP’s role isn’t to profit, it’s to maintain system solvency. The vault doesn’t pick and choose liquidations based on profitability. Instead, it operates as a public good, ensuring all users remain protected during sharp market dislocations. HLP charges no liquidation fees. Its child vault architecture, designed through countless simulations, ensures that the system maximizes protection while managing its own risk. During the event, several child vaults themselves became temporarily undercollateralized after taking on massive user positions. This was intentional: their isolation prevents risk from spilling over into the rest of the protocol. HLP was even the largest address group on the triggered side of ADL, by more than an order of magnitude. Traders on the providing side of these ADL events collectively realized hundreds of millions of dollars in additional profit, capturing momentary dislocation windows that closed within seconds. Transparency Sets Hyperliquid Apart Jeff contrasted Hyperliquid’s design with that of other venues where liquidation mechanisms are opaque and internally managed. On those exchanges, liquidation engines might operate with different margin requirements or selectively backstop positions to protect exchange revenue, potentially at the cost of solvency risk. “On some venues, exchanges could have liquidated more positions and extracted hundreds of millions in revenue,” Jeff noted. “That’s not an acceptable tradeoff for Hyperliquid.” Transparency and onchain verifiability are at the heart of the protocol’s credibility. Every liquidation event, every ADL, and every fund movement is public, not obscured by internal matching systems or offchain reports. Jeff concluded his post by recognizing the difficulties traders faced during the market crash but reaffirmed his commitment to building a transparent and resilient system. “I know this is a difficult time for many traders,” he said. “As a contributor to Hyperliquid, I’ll keep working to build the best platform that can house all of finance.” He urged the community to stay united, pointing out that times like this reveal the importance of fairness and transparency in financial systems. The event was not just a test of market participants, it was a real-world stress test for Hyperliquid’s design. And by all accounts, the system passed.

News Background The recovery follows a 50 % wipe-out triggered by President Trump’s 100 % China-tariff declaration, which wiped $19 billion in crypto liquidations in minutes. Renewed buying has since restored confidence, with analysts eyeing a potential record weekly close above $3.12 that would mark XRP’s strongest candle since inception. Broader markets remain risk-off—Dow –900, Nasdaq –820—but crypto desks flagged selective institutional inflows into XRP. Price Action Summary XRP jumped 8.5 % between Oct 12 05:00 and Oct 13 04:00, trading a $0.22 (9 %) range $2.37–$2.59. Breakout bursts hit during 14:00–17:00 as volumes spiked to 276.8 M—over 2× daily average (118 M). Support confirmed at $2.37 with high-volume reversals; resistance formed near $2.59. Late-session push through $2.57 closed at $2.58 on 2.3 M turnover, validating continuation. Technical Analysis Structure now shows a clean ascending channel: $2.37 base, $2.59 lid. Sustained closes above $2.59 could open $2.70–$2.75, while failure to defend $2.50 risks retrace toward $2.42. Momentum remains bullish with institutional prints leading each breakout leg. Analysts highlight the breakout above $2.57 as confirmation of a near-term trend reversal; continued volume support keeps upside bias intact. What Traders Are Watching? Whether $2.57 holds as the new support pivot. Break above $2.59 to target $2.70–$2.75; stretch goal $3.00+. Trade-war headlines and Fed rhetoric driving cross-asset risk appetite.

While Zhao confirmed he applied for a pardon, he explained that he was never charged with fraud. The decision, however, could be complicated by Trump’s own ties to the crypto sector through ventures like World Liberty Financial and the TRUMP meme coin. CZ Could Receive Trump Pardon The Trump administration is reportedly considering a pardon for Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who pleaded guilty to a money laundering violation in 2024 and served four months in prison. According to Fox Business correspondent Charles Gasparino , sources close to Zhao claim that Trump insiders see the case as weak and undeserving of a felony conviction or jail time. Gasparino even suggested that a pardon could pave the way for Zhao’s return to Binance, where he is still the largest shareholder. Under the Trump administration, the White House adopted a much friendlier stance toward the crypto industry. It already moved to end long-running enforcement actions, advanced new regulatory frameworks, and issued pardons to people like BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes and his colleagues, as well as Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. Zhao acknowledged Gasparino’s report on X but stopped short of confirming any direct knowledge of a potential pardon. In his response, he also clarified that he was not charged with fraud, but instead pleaded guilty to a single violation of the Banking Secrecy Act — a rare instance that he claims made him the only person in US history to receive a prison sentence for such a charge without any prior offenses. Zhao’s conviction came after Binance reached a $4.3 billion settlement with US authorities in November of 2023. As part of the agreement, Zhao paid a $50 million fine, resigned as CEO, and was barred from working for the exchange. Gasparino said that while a decision on the pardon could be announced soon, some officials in the White House are concerned about how it might look given President Trump’s own connections to the crypto sector. Trump and his family previously faced scrutiny for their involvement in digital asset ventures, including the World Liberty Financial protocol and the TRUMP meme coin. The columnist added that the situation is still fluid, as the president is currently occupied with other high-priority matters, including the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, and trade talks with China.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BNB|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-13 05:30:00

Institutional desks led the breakout, pushing volume to four times its daily average as momentum indicators flipped decisively bullish. Traders are now watching for confirmation above $0.22 to extend gains toward $0.24–$0.25. News Background DOGE’s 11% rally unfolded from Oct. 12 05:00 to Oct. 13 04:00, climbing from $0.19 to $0.21 after peaking at $0.22. The move coincided with a surge in institutional activity and a broader rebound across meme-coins. Analysts cited increasing open interest and heavy on-chain accumulation as signs of professional flows re-entering the market.

Resistance sits tight at $0.22, where multiple attempts are testing supply. The pattern shows an ascending trendline with constructive momentum; MACD and RSI signals remain bullish.

The pressure on regional equities persisted despite a late attempt at reassurance from President Donald Trump, who wrote on Truth Social, ""Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine."" On the geopolitical front, Trump said on Sunday that the Gaza war has ended as he flew to Israel for the release of hostages. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) steadied around $115,000 on Monday after a sharp selloff last week, as US President Donald Trump walked back his threat to impose massive tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that trade relations with the country “will all be fine.” Gold scaled an all-time peak of $4,070 per ounce on Monday, as renewed US-China trade concerns and economic uncertainty boosted safe-haven demand. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 1.01%. The Japanese yen weakened toward 152 per dollar in thin holiday trading on Monday, reversing some of the previous session’s gains. In Japan, markets reassessed the odds that LDP leader Sanae Takaichi will become prime minister and roll out fresh fiscal stimulus after Komeito quit the ruling coalition on Friday, ending a partnership of more than 25 years over what it called Takaichi’s failure to “provide sufficient answers regarding political funding issues.” China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.72% to around 3,860 while the Shenzhen Component dropped 2.3% to 13,050 on Monday, extending losses from the previous session after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing’s new export controls on rare earth minerals, and the offshore yuan edged higher to around 7.14 per dollar on Monday. China vowed to retaliate if the tariffs are implemented. However, Trump later signaled openness to negotiate ahead of a possible meeting with President Xi Jinping later this month, saying that trade relations with China “will all be fine.” China posted a $90.45 billion trade surplus in September 2025 . Exports grew 8.3% ( y/y ) to $328.6 billion, marking a seven-month high and exceeding expectations. Imports also accelerated, rising 7.4% ( y/y ) to $238.1 billion. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 2.63% to 25,776 on Monday morning, marking the sixth session of losses and the lowest level in a month. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.33% to 82,178 in morning trade on Monday, halting gains from the previous two sessions as renewed US-China trade tensions rattled investor sentiment. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.84% to 8,910 on Monday, extending losses from the previous week as weakness in the mining and energy sectors continued to pressure the index. The Australian dollar rose toward $0.653 on Monday, rebounding from significant losses in the previous week, as investor sentiment improved following reassuring comments from President Donald Trump amid rising tensions in the US-China trade dispute. Australia is considering mandated floor prices for critical minerals and new funding for rare earth projects as part of a proposed resources deal with the U.S., the Age reported Sunday. Domestically, investors are closely watching for the release of the RBA meeting minutes, upcoming speeches by central bank officials, and key labor market data expected in the coming days. In the U.S. on Friday, all three major indexes ended lower retreating from recent highs after President Donald Trump rattled markets with threats of a “massive” tariff hike on Chinese goods and suggested he might cancel his upcoming meeting with President Xi Jinping. Investors now await earnings results from major banks later this week, including from Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley. U.S. stock futures climbed on Monday after President Donald Trump suggested he may scale back his threat to impose steep new tariffs on China: Dow +0.87% ; S&P 500 +1.27% ; Nasdaq +1.70%.

With the recent purchase, the company holds a total of 53,250 BTC, worth $6.12 billion.

MARA’s Bitcoin Strategy is Both Aggressive and Innovative MARA, formerly known as Marathon Digital Holdings, has been highly active in expanding its Bitcoin reserve throughout late 2024 and early 2025. MARA’s Bitcoin holdings reached 49,951 BTC by the end of June, a 170% increase year-over-year, valued at $5.3 billion. “We are more than a bitcoin treasury company,” MARA said in its July Q2 2025 report . Besides, the firm has been expanding its focus beyond mining. It recently announced partnerships with Google-backed TAE Power Solutions and LG-backed PADO AI to co-develop energy-efficient platforms tailored for AI and next-gen data centers. According to CEO Fred Thiel, the company aims to scale to 75 EH/s by the end of 2025. “Our vertically integrated mining operations, large BTC treasury, budding international energy partnerships, and early AI infrastructure investments each contribute distinct and measurable value,” Thiel said in July. MARA Buys BTC Despite Stock Decline The leading BTC miner saw its stock price decline by 9.33% on October 10 and later recovered slightly by 2.66%. The company’s stocks are currently trading at $19.13, according to Yahoo Finance . The downturn is primarily attributed to mixed options sentiment, which overshadowed the company’s strategic initiatives and operational successes.

This led to a cascade of liquidations as traders scrambled to save their positions. Now, though, with the liquidation event out of the way and the market looking to be bouncing back, things are beginning to look up for the PEPE price, which one analyst believes is primed for a monster rally from here. PEPE Price Is Set To Soar Crypto analyst MMBTtrader took to the TradingView website to share their view of what could be happening with the PEPE price. According to the analyst, the PEPE price decline was expected , but not as fast as it played out. Nevertheless, it plays into the bigger picture and the reset that the meme coin needed. MMBTtrader explains that the path for the PEPE price is now clear as it is ready to rally. They point out that the red long candle that sent the altcoin spiraling could’ve been the result of market manipulation. This is a thought that many in the space share, especially with many altcoins basically crashing up to 80% in a single candle. However, the crypto analyst believes that a move like this is only the precursor of something big that is coming for the market. With liquidations rising by over $19 billion on Friday, it marked the single largest liquidation event in the history of crypto, and many believe this is a needed reset for the market. The crypto analyst explains that the move was indeed needed to hunt and kick out leverage traders, regardless of their positions. In the aftermath of it all, most long traders were affected, regardless of how high or how low their leverage was. Data from the Coinglass website shows that some crypto exchanges recorded up to 96% of all liquidations for that day being long traders. Looking at the chart shared by the crypto analyst, the PEPE price has bounced back above major monthly support. This support sits at the $0.000005 level, and since bulls have so far held above it, it could be the take-off point for the next upward rally. If this level holds, then there are multiple levels of interest for the PEPE price . The first stop in the bounce would be the $0.00001 level, where most of the resistance has lain over the last few months. Once broken, though, this would set the stage for the rally as it moves up rapidly. The next stage of the rally would be the $0.000013 level as bears begin to put up a fight. By this level, though, the PEPE price would be almost 100% up . Then the next major level would be the $0.000016, the point to be broken. If all of the resistances along the way are evenly surpassed, then the crypto analyst sees the PEPE price reaching new all-time highs . The target from here would be the $0.00003047 level, which the analyst refers to as the final goal, completing a 230% move.",PEPE|Pepe|pepe coin|PEPE news|PEPE price|PEPEUSD|PEPEUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|PEPE|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-13 06:00:06

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-the-upside-is-obvious-heres-what-it-means/,"Max Avery, a well-known figure in crypto and finance circles, recently shared his views on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and its growing relevance in the evolving tokenization landscape. His comments provided a grounded perspective on what many XRP holders believe to be a significant turning point for the network. While the digital asset market continues to fluctuate, Avery’s remarks stand out for their focus on tangible growth rather than relying on speculation and investor optimism. Institutional Integration and Real Utility Avery stated that “every time a new institution starts using the XRP Ledger to issue or trade tokenized assets, it adds volume, activity, and real-world use.” His point highlights a growing movement among blockchain projects to attract institutional adoption, but in XRP’s case, the focus is firmly on practical utility rather than speculation. Over the past few years, Ripple’s work with the XRPL has progressed steadily toward creating a framework capable of handling institutional-grade asset tokenization . As markets worldwide transition into the digital age, XRP is poised to dominate the emerging tokenization space. For XRP holders, the upside’s obvious. Every time a new institution starts using the XRP Ledger to issue or trade tokenized assets, it adds volume, activity, and real-world use Ripple’s been focused on turning the XRPL into the plumbing for trillions in tokenized assets with… — Max Avery (@realMaxAvery) October 11, 2025 Ripple’s Infrastructure Vision Ripple has been positioning the XRPL as the infrastructure backbone for the digitization and tokenization of real-world assets, which is the next phase of global finance. According to Avery, Ripple’s focus is directed toward transforming the ledger into “the plumbing for trillions in tokenized assets.” This statement aligns with the company’s long-term vision of embedding XRP within financial systems that require speed, compliance, and interoperability. What separates XRP from competing digital assets is its readiness for institutional use. The XRPL’s performance and scalability have been tested across multiple pilot programs and partnerships involving central bank digital currencies and tokenized commodities. These efforts have established a foundation that supports Avery’s perspective that the XRPL is not an experimental blockchain but one designed for real-world financial integration. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Perception and Institutional Reality Despite Ripple’s progress, skepticism continues to shape public perception of XRP. Much of the market still views it primarily through a speculative lens rather than as a piece of financial infrastructure. Avery’s comments address this disconnect, suggesting that many fail to see or acknowledge the progress taking place in real time. He noted that XRP’s next-generation infrastructure is already taking shape in real-time, emphasizing that adoption is not a distant goal but an active process underway. Institutional participation has quietly expanded in sectors such as cross-border payments and asset tokenization. Each new integration of the XRPL into real-world use cases strengthens its position as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain systems .

London/Johannesburg, October 2025 — In an era of global economic uncertainty, one investment manager’s story is inspiring people worldwide to rediscover the potential of digital assets. Andy, 43, was once a successful investment manager handling multi-million-dollar portfolios in the fast-paced financial sector. His life revolved around boardrooms, clients, and high-stakes decisions. But a single investment failure changed everything — his career collapsed, his company downsized, and debts began to pile up. With mortgage payments, car loans, and three children’s tuition fees pressing on him, Andy found himself at rock bottom. “Every morning I still put on my suit, but I had nowhere to go,” Andy recalls. “That sense of loss was suffocating.” Starting today, all new users who register for SIM Mining will receive $100 in free hashrate.

While browsing a finance forum, Andy came across a discussion about cloud mining — a way to earn digital assets like Bitcoin without owning machines or managing complex hardware. As a former investment professional, skepticism came naturally. But phrases like “low entry barrier,” “transparent system,” and “secure platform” caught his attention. He began researching the compliance and reliability of several platforms and eventually chose SIM Mining, a UK-registered and regulated company. “ I trusted SIM Mining because its system is transparent, fully compliant, and easy to use. Even someone without technical expertise can get started in minutes ,” Andy said. From Doubt to Transformation The process was simple — create an account, deposit funds, and select a mining contract. Within 24 hours, Andy saw his first earnings appear in his account. “It wasn’t the amount that moved me,” he said. “It was the fact that I saw hope for the first time in years. That tiny number on my screen told me my life could change.” From then on, Andy’s daily mining rewards continued steadily. Within months, he paid off part of his debt and stabilized his family’s finances. SIM Mining: A Transparent, Secure, and Compliant Cloud Mining Platform Founded in 2018 and headquartered in the UK, SIM Mining is a legally registered cloud mining platform that allows users to participate in digital asset mining — including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) — directly from their phone or computer. Its mining power is backed by professional data centers, and all earnings are automatically calculated and distributed daily. Users can monitor their profits, withdraw, or reinvest with just a few taps on their mobile device. “SIM Mining made complex blockchain mining as simple as opening a bank account,” Andy noted. “I can track my performance anytime, anywhere, and the transparency gives me peace of mind.” Today, SIM Mining serves millions of users globally and has undergone multiple institutional security and compliance audits. To help beginners get started, the platform also offers a $100 free starter credit, allowing users to experience cloud mining with zero financial risk. Rebuilding Confidence and a New Life Over the past three years, Andy has earned more than $800,000 through SIM Mining. But for him, the true value goes beyond money. “SIM Mining wasn’t just an investment tool — it was a bridge that carried me from despair to renewal,” he said. “It helped me stand tall again in my 40s and reminded me that the future is still worth believing in.” A New Path to Financial Freedom As inflation rises and traditional income sources struggle to keep pace, stories like Andy’s are showing a new side of digital finance. With its compliance, transparency, and accessibility, SIM Mining is providing individuals worldwide with a genuine path toward financial flexibility and independence.

In a post on X, Yan said Hyperliquid’s fully on-chain liquidation data could not be compared with what he called “underreported CEX liquidations.” He argued that on-chain systems allow anyone to verify trades, orders, and liquidations in real time, ensuring transparency and fairness for users. “Some CEXs publicly document that they dramatically underreport user liquidations,” Yan wrote, pointing to Binance as an example. “Even if there are thousands of liquidation orders in the same second, only one is reported. Because liquidations happen in bursts, this could easily be 100x underreporting under some conditions.” Hyperliquid’s fully onchain liquidations cannot be compared with underreported CEX liquidations Hyperliquid is a blockchain where every order, trade, and liquidation happens onchain.

Zhao, known widely as CZ, responded with a post that appeared to address the criticism indirectly. “Some people ask why is #BNB so strong?” he wrote. “While others tried to ignore, hide, shift blame, or attack competitors, the key @BNBChain ecosystem players (Binance, Venus, and more) took hundreds of millions out of their own pockets to PROTECT USERS,” he said.

Market Rout Sparks Tensions Between Binance, Hyperliquid The exchange of posts followed the Oct. 10–11 market crash that sent shockwaves through the crypto sector. Bitcoin plunged from $122,000 to $109,000, wiping out more than $19b in leveraged positions. CoinGlass described it as one of the largest liquidation cascades in crypto history, impacting over 1.6 million traders. During the chaos, Hyperliquid reportedly handled $50–$70b in trading volume without any downtime or disruption. Meanwhile, Binance experienced temporary technical issues that left some users unable to close positions for nearly an hour. As a result, frustration spread quickly across social media, with traders saying the delays deepened their losses. CZ Clarifies Binance Has No Current Ties to Hyperliquid Despite Past Incubation Links Zhao also reshared a post comparing liquidation rates, which showed Binance liquidating 60% of long positions while decentralized exchanges such as Hyperliquid saw closer to 90%. Last week, Zhao addressed speculation that Binance has investment ties to Hyperliquid . He clarified that while Jeff Yan participated in Binance Labs’ first incubation program in 2018 through a startup called YZiLabs, the company failed and Binance did not recover its investment. Hyperliquid has grown rapidly since its launch, operating on its own Layer-1 blockchain and ranking among the most active decentralized perpetual trading platforms. According to DefiLlama, it handled $319b in trading volume in July, contributing to a record $487b across DeFi perpetual markets that month.

The MACD remains in bearish territory, showing limited buying momentum, while the RSI at 33.94 indicates oversold conditions, hinting at a potential short-term rebound. The Bollinger Bands suggest high volatility, with price movement near the lower band signaling possible support around $0.0137. However, resistance stands near $0.0175, which may cap any upward attempts.

Traders hold 50% in MUTM,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/13/what-crypto-suits-a-20k-portfolio-traders-hold-50-in-mutm/,"For traders shaping a $20,000 crypto portfolio ahead of the 2026 bull run, one project has begun standing out across the DeFi world — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Many seasoned investors are already placing half of their holdings, around $10,000, into this Ethereum-based protocol. Its ongoing presale, audited framework, and yield-based lending system have made it a core holding for those aiming to grow their crypto investment before prices rise further. The presale surge and why traders are taking position Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now deep into Phase 6 of its presale, raising $17.12 million overall with 62% of the available 170 million tokens sold. The current token price sits at $0.035, and Phase 7 will raise it by 15% to $0.040. With more than 16,850 holders, the project has already gained the attention of retail investors, DeFi enthusiasts, and whales alike. Investors who entered at Phase 1’s $0.01 price now hold 250% value growth, and when listings begin around $0.06, they are expected to see around 500% value gain. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s model revolves around a dual lending structure designed for flexibility and yield. In the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system, users will deposit major assets such as ETH and DAI into audited smart contracts. These funds will then be used to issue overcollateralized loans. For instance, a lender depositing $15,000 in USDT will earn around $2,250 in annual returns through the protocol’s variable rates. In return, they will receive mtTokens — digital receipts that represent their share of the liquidity pool. These mtTokens can later be staked to earn MUTM rewards, multiplying earnings over time. Borrowers, on the other hand, will use crypto collateral to unlock instant liquidity without selling their assets. For example, locking $5,000 worth of ETH will allow borrowing up to $3,750 in stablecoins — a 75% loan-to-value ratio. This feature lets investors access funds while keeping exposure to ETH’s price movement, a strategy favored by active traders managing their tax efficiency and portfolio flexibility. Stability, security, and why whales are moving in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also stands out for its decentralized stablecoin design, which will keep a consistent $1 peg. The stablecoin will be minted when users borrow against collateral and burned once those loans are repaid or liquidated. Governance will adjust borrowing rates dynamically to maintain peg stability. When the stablecoin trades above $1, borrowing costs will decrease to encourage issuance. When it drops below $1, borrowing costs will rise to push the price back toward balance. This smart mechanism creates a stable, self-regulating ecosystem that strengthens user trust. Behind this financial logic lies a strong security foundation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a CertiK audit, scoring 90.00 on TokenScan and 79.00 on Skynet through both static analysis and manual review. The project has also launched a $50,000 bug bounty program that rewards community members up to $2,000 for identifying critical vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, a $100,000 giveaway campaign rewards 10 early participants with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each — driving user engagement while expanding the project’s holder base. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s 12K+ Twitter followers reflect a growing audience eager to join before the presale moves to its next stage. Roadmap and sepolia testnet The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) roadmap shows clear progress. Earlier phases focused on presale, marketing, and audits. The next milestones include full smart contract integration, DApp front-end rollout, and back-end infrastructure. The beta launch will go live, introducing new modules such as liquidity pools, debt tokens, and liquidator bots. These developments will pave the way for a public mainnet launch with institutional partnerships and exchange listings. On top of that, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced that it is developing a crypto lending and borrowing platform. The first version, V1, is set to launch on the Sepolia testnet in late 2025. It will feature key components such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure smooth operation. At launch, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral securely and efficiently.

Key Takeaways: A crypto whale reopened a $163M Bitcoin short after profiting $192M from a trade before Trump’s tariff announcement. The trader’s timing has raised accusations of insider trading and possibly triggering a weekend liquidation cascade. Binance denied any technical fault during the crash, offering $283M in compensation to users affected. Blockchain data shows that the trader , identified by the address 0xb317 on the decentralized derivatives exchange Hyperliquid, opened a $163 million short position on Bitcoin late Sunday. The new 10x leveraged bet is already up $3.5 million in unrealized profit, though it risks liquidation if Bitcoin climbs to $125,500. ‘Insider Whale’ Accused After $192M Crypto Short Timed Before Trump Tariff News The trader gained notoriety last week after opening a nine-figure short position just 30 minutes before Donald Trump’s tariff announcement, which triggered a market-wide plunge and earned the address nearly $192 million in profit. The timing has sparked accusations of insider trading, with observers calling the entity an “insider whale.” Crypto analyst MLM noted that the trader reportedly shorted additional amounts of BTC and ETH minutes before the crash, suggesting they might have fueled the weekend’s liquidation cascade. “This guy played a huge role in what happened today,” MLM posted. On-chain trackers later revealed that over 250 wallets lost millionaire status on Hyperliquid following the selloff. Not everyone is bearish, however. Another trader reportedly went long $11 million on Bitcoin with 40x leverage, betting on a rebound after the market chaos. Still, the sharp volatility and lack of oversight in decentralized trading have reignited debates about crypto market integrity. “Crypto people are realizing today what it means to have unregulated markets — insider trading, corruption, crime, and zero accountability,” said Janis Kluge, a researcher at SWP Berlin. In case you didn’t know – the BTC whale closed 90% of his BTC short and fully closed his ETH short, making around $190–$200M profit in just one day on Hyperliquid. The crazy part is that he shorted another 9 figs worth of BTC and ETH minutes before the cascade happened. And this… pic.twitter.com/QhmUpesG0j — MLM (@mlmabc) October 10, 2025 Meanwhile, Binance faced fresh scrutiny amid rumors that its systems malfunctioned during the selloff. Several traders reported failed stop-loss orders, token depeggings, and sudden liquidations. Binance responded, denying any technical fault and attributing the event to a “display issue.” “We are aware of speculation in the market regarding the causes of this event,” the exchange stated, confirming that its core futures, spot, and API systems remained operational. Binance later said it would compensate affected users , offering $283 million to those holding depegged collateral assets such as USDE, BNSOL, and WBETH. Trump’s Approval Hits New Lows amid Government Shutdown US President Donald Trump’s approval rating has fallen sharply , with just 40% of Americans approving and 58% disapproving, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. The drop follows growing criticism of his decision to militarize law enforcement. A separate HarrisX survey showed a slightly higher 46% approval, underscoring the deep partisan divide across the country. The decline comes amid an ongoing government shutdown triggered by Congress’s failure to pass spending bills by the October 1 deadline. Trump blamed Democrats, saying he would target their programs in future budget cuts. Meanwhile, on the Polymarket prediction platform, 86% of traders expect the shutdown to continue past October 15, reflecting waning confidence in Washington’s ability to compromise. Trump’s pro-crypto stance, a central theme of his 2024 campaign, is also drawing scrutiny. Senator Elizabeth Warren has warned that Trump’s crypto involvement could pose ethical risks if he profits from related ventures while in office.

Bitcoin and Ether have both recovered back to the middle of their range-bound channels, but some of the AI-related altcoins are surging. AI-focused crypto token Bittensor (TAO) has pumped a whopping 35%, topping $410 in an eleven-week high on Monday morning. However, the native token for the decentralized machine learning network remains down 46% from its all-time high. Another AI token, ChainOpera AI (COAI), has skyrocketed a whopping 70% to an all-time high of $43.80 on Sunday. Decentralized GPU compute platform Render (RNDR) has gained 17% on the day to reach $2.80 during Monday morning trading in Asia. Altcoins Leading the Recovery DeFi platform Mantle (MNT) has also surged today, with a 27% move to reclaim $2.20, recovering all losses from the weekend rout. The Trump family DeFi platform (WLFI) is on the rise as well, with an 18% gain on the day to reach $14.30 at the time of writing. Binance’s tokens, BNB and ASTER, were both performing well, gaining 14% apiece. The Binance exchange was implicated during the big crash as its market maker froze and a number of tokens depegged, leading to mass liquidations. The firm issued a statement on Sunday that this happened before the selloff but offered compensation to traders who held USDE, BNSOL, and WBETH as collateral. ETH had made more than 8%, reclaiming $4,200, XRP jumped by 9% to $2.57, and Solana was up 8% at $195. Meanwhile, Dogecoin, Chainlink, and Sui were all in double-figure gains as altcoins led the market recovery today. In the future, we’ll look back at this wick and see it as a bump before new highs.

The last time altcoins dumped so hard was the March 2020 COVID meltdown, and a massive altseason followed in 2021. “The fact that Bitcoin held above $115K after that kind of stress is a testament to the asset’s structural strength,” he added. BTC recovered 5% from its sub-$110,000 dip and was trading at $115,300 at the time of writing.

This index, which measures the market sentiment and shows on a scale how investors are feeling about the crypto market, has now fallen back into the Extreme Fear territory. The number on the scale now shows the lowest level it has been since the market crash back in April 2025. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Sees Major Crash The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index uses a number of factors to determine how investors are feeling about the market. It takes into account things like volatility, social sentiment aggregated across different social media platforms, market volume and momentum, and market dominance to come to a figure. Related Reading: Crypto Crash: $19.5 Billion Wiped Out In Record-Breaking Liquidation Event The data is aggregated, which puts it on a scale of 1-100, with 1-25 being Extreme Fear, 26-46 being Fear, 47-54 being Neutral, 55-75 representing Greed, and 76-100 representing Extreme Greed. Each of these shows either bullishness, bearishness, or nonchalance in the market. The most recent data shows that the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index crashed to 24 on Sunday. This puts the index firmly in Extreme Fear territory, suggesting that investors are extremely cautious at this point. It also shows a reluctance to enter into any positions at this time. This is the result of the massive liquidation event that happened last Friday, with crypto traders losing over $19 billion in one day. Thus, it is no surprise that fear has gripped the market. However, this would also present a unique opportunity in the market. Buy When The Market Is Bleeding One of the oldest sayings in the financial world is to “buy when there is blood on the streets.” This represents times of extreme losses, where most investors are scared to put their money in the market. Thus, with the market teetering on Extreme Fear, it could be the time to buy. Related Reading: XRP’s 2017 Pattern Returns In 2025, Analyst Predicts Massive Rally The last time that the market declined into Extreme Fear this low was back in April 2025, and what followed was a rally that saw the Bitcoin price reach new all-time highs in May 2025. If this trend holds, then the market could be looking at a possible rapid increase. By Sunday, the market was already recovering, with the Bitcoin price crossing $114,000 and Ethereum making its way back above $4,000. It is still quite early to tell if the market is in a full recovery trend, but with prices already bouncing, it could signal the next wave of gains.

Avalon X is in the presale stage right now, and many are calling it a possible 100× crypto coin for 2025. Cardano, Stellar, and Ripple have already seen a huge rise and have the potential to rise even more. These numbers show why these projects are some of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in for the best returns in 2025. Avalon X (AVLX): The Next Big Crypto in 2025 That Could Deliver 100× Returns The spotlight right now is firmly on Avalon X crypto, an ambitious project redefining real estate tokenization crypto. Having just progressed to Stage 2, where the token price is set at $0.01. Stage 1 was completed successfully, yielding a 100% return on investment for early participants with more than 43 million tokens sold in that stage. Early investors are positioning themselves for what could be the next big crypto in 2025. With analysts calling it a potential 100× crypto coin for 2025, Avalon X is stirring major excitement. Every early-stage investor dreams of finding that one golden ticket before it takes off, and Avalon X could be that ticket. Avalon X is a real estate backed cryptocurrency. This means that investors can invest in real estate crypto assets that have real-world value while still trading them online. The total supply is limited to 2 billion tokens, and 60% of those will go to presale distribution. As tokens sell out fast, more investors are racing to secure their allocation before prices rise in the next stage. And if that wasn’t enough to grab your attention, Avalon X is turning up the heat with one of the most generous early adoption campaigns the crypto market has ever seen. Avalon X is running an unprecedented $1M crypto giveaway , one of the biggest in 2025. The Avalon X giveaway includes 10 lucky winners, each receiving $100,000 worth of AVLX tokens, plus an exclusive crypto townhouse giveaway in the luxurious gated Eco Avalon development. Investors don’t just want in; they want in right now. Eco Avalon Townhouse Giveaway Avalon X is adding to the excitement with the referral program running alongside the giveaways, offering participants 10 bonus entries for each successful referral along with an additional 10% in tokens. The program creates a fun and rewarding opportunity for the community to engage more deeply and increase their chances of winning. Avalon X has passed a full security audit by CertiK , which adds to its credibility and shows that safety and transparency are its top priorities. The roadmap also shows that there will be future listings on major tier-1 CEXs like Binance and Uniswap. This sets the stage for a potentially explosive debut when trading starts publicly. Avalon X is more than just a token; it’s a link between investing in crypto backed by real world assets and traditional investing. With these features, Avalon X seems to be the best crypto to buy in 2025. Ripple (XRP): A Veteran Contender with Renewed Momentum The XRP price is at $2.73 and has posted a stunning +450% rally over the past year. Despite facing resistance zones, XRP maintains high liquidity and growing institutional support. Source: TradingView Recent XRP news suggests that clearer rules in the US have made investors more confident and excited about the market again. Experts think that XRP’s next breakout could take it to higher levels once it clearly breaks out of its consolidation phase. Stellar (XLM): Technical Breakout on the Horizon Stellar (XLM) has been strong even though it has faced short-term resistance at $0.369. Technical analysts are keeping a close eye on a possible double-bottom formation, which is a bullish pattern that could start the next leg up. Source: TradingView If XLM sustains movement above its key Fibonacci level at $0.375, a continuation toward past highs becomes increasingly likely. Its consistent performance makes it a solid option for investors. Cardano (ADA): Strong Structure, Big Price Forecasts Cardano (ADA) is at around $0.782, maintaining a strong position above long-term moving averages. Source: TrDadingView Analysts forecast a Cardano price range between $0.66 and $1.88 for 2025, with Cardano price prediction reaching as high as $2.36 upon confirmed breakout momentum. Cardano may present far higher growth potential given its momentum and potential. Avalon X Offers The Best Return With a low entry price, real estate backing, and its Avalon X $1M prize campaign, AVLX is fast becoming the most talked-about project in crypto circles. Early buyers are positioning themselves for what could be the biggest ROI play of the year. Don’t wait until the headlines read ‘Avalon X Hits Binance’ to realize what you missed, the smartest investors are already positioning early. Now is the best time to act.

Speaking in an interview shared on X by Crypto influencer Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), Long reflected on the changing attitudes of major financial institutions, describing what appears to be a decisive turn in sentiment after years of uncertainty. “It feels like the floodgates are going to open this year,” she said, referencing renewed interest from global banks that had previously held back due to regulatory hesitation. According to Long, institutions such as Bank of America, one of Ripple’s early partners during its initial payment solution phase, are now showing a marked increase in enthusiasm for XRP adoption. BREAKING: Monica Long reveals Bank of America CEO says ""We're all in on $XRP Once BlackRock announces the XRP ETF, the flood gates are about to burst… #Crypto #CryptoCommunity pic.twitter.com/ppC3DsbRmi — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) October 12, 2025 Changing Tone from Major Banks Long described a notable shift in the approach of banking executives, particularly in the wake of recent U.S. regulatory and political developments. She recalled that in the past, many institutions were discouraged by what she described as a lack of clarity and, at times, hostility toward using digital assets like XRP. This, she noted, created a difficult environment for innovation and collaboration. Her comments suggested that this period of hesitation is now giving way to renewed momentum. She stated, “You hear from CEOs like Bank of America saying, we’re all in,” revealing the return of institutional confidence to XRP and the broader crypto market, particularly among banks that have maintained relationships with Ripple . Optimism and Policy Shifts Long also linked the change in tone to the U.S. presidential election, noting that conversations with banks on partnerships in reserve banking and transaction services for Ripple’s stablecoin and payments operations have changed significantly. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 She explained that the shift occurred “overnight” after the election narrative began influencing expectations about financial policy and regulatory direction. This optimism aligns with growing speculation within the digital asset space that 2025 is a turning point for institutional adoption . Xaif, who shared the interview, remarked that once BlackRock announces its XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) , it could trigger a surge in institutional participation, an expectation widely echoed across the crypto community, though not confirmed by either company. Renewed Confidence in Digital Assets Long’s remarks suggest that Ripple sees a clear path forward for deeper collaboration between financial institutions and blockchain technology providers. With longstanding partners reportedly re-engaging in discussions about payments and stablecoin infrastructure, XRP’s position as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-based systems appears to be strengthening.

Meanwhile, experts and analysts likely spent the weekend exploring what triggered the largest flash crash in the asset class’s history. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid founder Jeff has joined those attacking Binance for its role in the massive October 10 slide. Jeff took it to X to publicly accuse Binance of hiding the scale of liquidation, warning that centralized exchanges are undermining the integrity of the whole cryptocurrency industry. jeff.hl @chameleon_jeff · Follow Hyperliquid’s fully onchain liquidations cannot be compared with underreported CEX liquidationsHyperliquid is a blockchain where every order, trade, and liquidation happens onchain. Anyone can permissionlessly verify the chain’s execution, including all liquidations and their 6:34 AM · Oct 13, 2025 404 Reply Copy link Read 100 replies He believes Binance’s reporting approach could mean 100x underreporting during intensified trading periods. Indeed, markets suffer enormous liquidations during wild swings. Thus, closing multiple positions in a second and only recording one can paint a distorted picture of the market for analysts and traders. According to Jeff, such narratives undermine trust in a sector that thrives on neutrality and transparency. He said: On Binance, even if there are thousands of liquidation orders in the same second, only one is reported. Because liquidations happen in bursts, this could easily be 100x underreporting under some conditions. These claims come as the cryptocurrency community debates whether they can trust data from top exchanges, especially when billions vanish during sudden dips. Some believe Binance manipulated the market, and it’s responsible for the current market weakness. Others are questioning why the native token BNB remained stable amid relentless dips. Decentralized exchanges are experiencing optimism as industry players rally against CEXs. Hyperliquid’s coin HYPE has rebounded from $36 to $40 over the previous day, an 11% jump. It has cooled to $38 at press time, with dwindling trading volumes signaling prevailing weakness. Chart by Coinmarketcap Nevertheless, caution remains paramount as the ongoing market revival could be a dead cat bounce. Hyperliquid’s transparency model Jeff highlighted how Hyperliquid differs from CEX. Unlike traditional exchanges, the DEX runs fully on-chain. All liquidations, orders, and trades happen on the blockchain, allowing anyone to view them anytime. With such a mode, users can verify individual transactions and the fairness and solvency of the whole market in real time. The founder anticipates an industry that prioritizes fairness, openness, and verifiability as digital assets integrate with the global financial sector. Hopefully, the industry will see transparency and neutrality as important features of the new financial system, and others will follow. A glimpse of the latest crypto crash: what happened? While headlines attributed the massive dips to Trump’s 100% tariffs on China , analysts emphasize that Binance was the real perpetrator. They discovered that a recognized market maker sent $700 million to Binance hours before the bloodbath. Meanwhile, the exchange’s order books started hollowing out, with zero bids, no depth, and no walls. That created a setup for free falls. Notably, BTC’s 1-minute candlesticks revealed massive Bitcoin dumps within minutes. Nonetheless, liquidation pressure surged to terminal velocity when Bitcoin crashed to $108,000. Reports suggest Binance’s market maker withdrew liquidity and stopped defending price declines. That catalyzed the market slump that unexpectedly vaporized billions. Binance has offered $283 million to compensate victims of forced liquidation in the latest flash crash.

This move, coupled with new export controls on software, has sparked the largest crypto liquidation in history. Over $19 billion in leveraged positions vanished within 24 hours, impacting 1.6 million traders. From above $125,000 to below $113,000, Bitcoin fell 12% and Ethereum and Solana also had significant losses. As a result, concerns about a trade war between the US and China have affected oil and equities, forcing investors to reevaluate risks in the face of increased volatility. The best cryptocurrency to buy during the current chaos shines brightly for anyone looking for stability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself by providing loan and borrowing services that mitigate the impact of the cryptocurrency meltdown. Bitcoin faces steep liquidation pressure Traders have watched Bitcoin lead the liquidation charge. Long positions evaporated to the tune of $5.34 billion as the asset slid sharply. This drop reflects broader market jitters from tariff shocks. Ethereum has also absorbed $4.39 billion in losses amid the frenzy. Borrowers scrambled as prices dipped, triggering automated sales. In addition, the network’s high fees compound recovery challenges post-crash. Thus, while Ethereum powers DeFi, its exposure to the same crypto price volatility undermines quick rebounds. As a result, it falls short as the top crypto to invest in for those eyeing resilient gains. In addition, Solana contributed $2 billion to the wipeout tally. Faster transactions failed to shield it from the tariff-induced panic. Moreover, altcoin correlations pulled it down alongside majors. However, liquidity constraints in stressed times reveal Solana’s limits. Therefore, it lags as a top crypto to invest in when crypto crashes, as demand for proven utility is lacking. Mutuum Finance presale accelerates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has drawn keen interest despite the crypto crash. The presale now enters phase 6 of 11 phases, with 65% filled rapidly. Investors have raised $17,250,000 since the start, and the total MUTM holders number 16,910. Current buyers secure tokens at $0.035, a 250% rise from the phase 1 price of $0.01. Phase 6 sells out fast, so opportunities at this level dwindle. Soon, phase 7 opens with a 14.3% hike to $0.04. At launch, MUTM reached $0.06, promising current holders a 420% ROI. Furthermore, this structure rewards early crypto investment in a protocol built for endurance. Mutuum builds lending protocol The team has announced its lending and borrowing protocol development. Version 1 deploys to Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Core elements include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bots. Initial assets cover ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, or collateral. In addition, overcollateralization ensures safety, while borrow caps limit risks. Thus, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) addresses why crypto is down by fostering stable yields. Consequently, it positions itself as the top crypto to invest in for long-term crypto investing. Mutuum hosts major giveaway As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announces its biggest giveaway, anticipation is growing. Ten winners get $100,000 in MUTM tokens from the tournament, with each winner receiving $10,000. For safe transactions, participants provide their wallet addresses. They complete quests to boost odds and confirm eligibility with a minimum $50 presale investment. Furthermore, this initiative highlights community focus. As crypto prices today fluctuate, it underscores Mutuum’s appeal in crypto investing. Navigating the wipeout with smart picks Tariff increases are the cause of today’s $19 billion cryptocurrency fall, but there are still chances. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have collapsed under strain, showing disparities in resiliency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, prospers solidly. This is due to its emphasis on security, presale momentum, and protocol usefulness. Thus, it reaffirms itself as the top crypto to invest in.

One of them, Jang Seong-ho, is utilizing a 6 billion won ($4.3 million) investment from Altos Ventures to develop an AI-driven filmmaking system at his studio, Mofac, which is built on Unreal Engine. With AI, Jang anticipates streamlined workflows and lower costs, enabling Mofac to produce a full-length film and a series annually. He commented, “With a powerful leader holding AI as a tool, the work that once required hundreds of people could soon be done by just one or two.” South Korean filmmakers have lined up AI projects During the 2020 pandemic, film production was halted, thwarting many filmmakers’ dreams. But for Jang Seong-ho, it helped to give birth to something new. At the time, his South Korean visual effects (VFX) and animation studio was a small operation barely holding together King of Kings, its animated adaptation of Dickens’ The Life of Our Lord, until Hollywood actors Kenneth Branagh, Oscar Isaac, and Uma Thurman joined the project. King of Kings, released stateside around Easter, broke a new U.S. record for South Korean cinema and surpassed the Oscar-winning Parasite’s success. So far, the film has earned $60 million in the U.S. and is on track to top $100 million globally by Christmas — an impressive feat for a production that cost just $25 million, a fraction of Hollywood’s usual budget. The film has already given Mofac recognition, and its plans for AI integration may solidify that standing even more. Mofac is not the only Korean studio venturing into AI. Pencil is reviving A Better Tomorrow in an AI-assisted animated remake. Moreover, Galaxy Corp., known for managing Song Kang-ho and G-Dragon, is developing AI-powered virtual characters with SKAI Intelligence and Nvidia’s Omniverse. Hive Media Corp., the producer of 12.12: The Day, also joins a growing list of Korean film studios eager to use AI for both animation and live-action work. Some companies have already actualized some of their AI projects. Earlier this year, Inshorts, an AI company, utilized its Super-Scaler technology to restore and remaster the film Leafie, a Hen into the Wild, in 4K. At that time, the company’s founder had claimed that integrating AI into the remastering process halved costs and greatly accelerated the work. December 2024 also saw the premiere of bold cinematic experiments featuring generative AI in theaters. It’s Me, Mun–hee and M Hotel saw their big screen debut, with the latter winning awards at both the Busan International Artificial Intelligence Film Festival and Venice’s Reply AI Film Festival. Park Chan-wook voiced fears that AI tools may jeopardize employment After founding Sora in early 2024, OpenAI started courting Hollywood. Leaders of the company, including Sam Altman, its chief executive officer, went to Los Angeles for a series of events and meetings with Hollywood executives. They held meetings with film companies, media executives, and talent agencies to showcase the technology; however, these meetings have not yet yielded any deals. Hollywood is still debating how to incorporate AI into the film industry, particularly with the introduction of OpenAI’s Sora . The artificial intelligence research and deployment company has spent months discussing Sora’s creative and business potential with Disney, Universal, and Warner Bros. Still, some filmmakers are concerned that they won’t be able to protect their IP. Attorney Aaron Moss commented, “Hollywood now faces a stark choice: Take action to protect its IP or wake up to find its most valuable properties circulating as AI-generated slop across social media.” Some film studios have gone so far as to file lawsuits in an effort to prove that AI apps are producing lookalike versions of their characters. Disney has already taken the first step, suing Midjourney to establish a precedent. Still, that hasn’t stopped Asian filmmakers from quickly adopting technologies like OpenAI’s Sora and Kuaishou’s Kling AI, which are capable of generating ultra-realistic videos in a matter of seconds. However, top directors are still concerned that AI could replace jobs and alter the artistic language of film. Park Chan-wook, known for Old Boy and No Other Choice, noted, “It could also take away many jobs and fundamentally alter the aesthetics of cinema.

CEO Nischal Shetty said Monday that the Singapore High Court has approved the scheme, paving the way for the exchange to move ahead with its rehabilitation efforts. Shetty did not disclose additional details about the approved plan, and a WazirX spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. However, the approval marks a turning point for the embattled platform, which has spent over a year navigating a complex restructuring process to restore user balances and resume full operations. Thank you to everyone who supported this difficult phase of WazirX. The Singapore High Court has approved the scheme. Its your support and love that has made this possible Now we set out on the next phase to work hard and create value for everyone. We’re here because of YOU… — Nischal (Shardeum) (@NischalShetty) October 13, 2025 Singapore Court Approval Caps Months Of Negotiations And Plan Revisions The court’s decision follows months of creditor engagement and revisions to the company’s original proposal. In August, more than 95% of WazirX’s creditors voted in favour of the updated scheme , filed by its Singapore-based parent company, Zettai Pte Ltd. The vote accounted for about $206.9m in validated claims from more than 149,000 account holders. Under the restructuring plan, WazirX aims to redistribute the remaining assets fairly, in line with Singapore’s Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act of 2018. To achieve this, the exchange chose a court-supervised Scheme of Arrangement instead of liquidation. This approach helped avoid years of delays — liquidation could have postponed recoveries until 2030 or later. Now that the court has approved the plan, WazirX can begin returning assets and gradually reopening trading services. According to company filings, the first round of token distributions will begin within 10 business days of the scheme taking effect. If all goes as expected, users could recover about 85% of their account balances, based on valuations from the date of the hack. Revised Scheme Clears Hurdles With Over 95% Creditor Approval The road to approval was not smooth. Initially, in March, more than 93% of creditors backed WazirX’s restructuring plan. However, in June, the Singapore High Court rejected the proposal due to regulatory concerns over token distributions. In response, WazirX revised the plan. The new version routed repayments through its Indian entity, Zanmai Labs, which is registered with the country’s Financial Intelligence Unit. As a result, the updated proposal gained even stronger support in the second vote, held between July 30 and Aug. 6. The process, coordinated by Kroll Issuer Services, was limited to users who held positive account balances as of July 18, 2024. Encouragingly, the high level of participation reflected renewed confidence in WazirX’s recovery plan after months of uncertainty. Meanwhile, Zettai Pte Ltd, acquired by Binance in 2019, played a pivotal role throughout the restructuring. The Singapore entity retained custody of WazirX’s crypto assets and liabilities, while Zanmai Labs continued to oversee fiat operations in India. WazirX Eyes Swift Return Of Trading And Withdrawals Post-Approval Following the hack , Zettai sought a moratorium from the Singapore High Court. The goal was to protect against global creditor actions and prevent assets from being split across jurisdictions. With the moratorium in place, WazirX was able to consolidate its restructuring under Singapore law. This ensured that both Indian and international users would be treated uniformly. Moreover, it reduced the risk of conflicting legal claims — a key issue after several Indian users questioned the applicability of WazirX’s terms of service. The hacking incident had caused heavy losses and frozen withdrawals, pushing the exchange close to insolvency. However, the court-approved restructuring plan now offers a clear path to stabilize operations and rebuild user trust. If all goes as planned, WazirX could resume trading and withdrawals within days of the scheme taking effect.

53073921,604635,1760340533,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53073921.jpeg,Grok’s Dogecoin Price Prediction After $19B Market Crash: Maxi Doge Raises $3.5M,https://bitcoinist.com/grok-dogecoin-price-prediction-after-market-crash-as-maxi-doge-raises-3-5m/,"Quick Facts: 1⃣ Dogecoin rebounded strongly after Trump’s tariff announcement, holding above its key long-term support line. 2⃣ Grok’s Dogecoin price prediction projects a potential 500% upside, targeting around $1.30. 3⃣ Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is neatly positioned as the top meme coin to ride Dogecoin’s next rally. Although Dogecoin plummeted nearly 60% on Friday after Donald Trump rocked crypto’s boat by announcing a new 100% tariff on China , the token was quick to snap back and regain much of the losses, closing the day down just 22% . Most importantly, the daily candle closed above the upward-sloping trend line that has been supporting the token since August of last year. Most recently, this same support line sparked a 100% rally in June-July 2025. Now that $DOGE has completed its support test this weekend, we decided to call in the big guns of AI to dig deep for this Dogecoin price prediction. Grok’s Dogecoin Price Prediction Points to a Massive 500% Upside For our analysis, we turned to Grok, one of the most powerful AI chatbots with real-time access to X, encompassing everything from real-time market updates to analyst remarks and online sentiment. Grok zoomed out on the charts and pointed to a neat breakout from a descending triangle. As you can see, $DOGE broke out of this consolidation zone in early September, and it was quick to retest the resistance line it had broken – precisely what we’d want to see after such a critical breakout. While Friday’s dump shook things up a bit, the token is now once again challenging the upper resistance line of the triangle pattern. As for a potential target, Grok measured the width of this triangle pattern and mapped it onto the expected breakout level of around $0.22. This gives us a potential target of around $1.30 – a massive 500% upside from current price levels. That said, the AI cautioned that $DOGE will have to grapple with its all-time high of $0.79 on its way upward to this target. Although Dogecoin’s 500% potential upside is nothing to sniff at, OG crypto investors know that’s just peanuts compared to what Dogecoin truly can – and has – delivered in the past. For instance, in 2017, when the token first rose to fame, it skyrocketed by an eye-popping 10,000% in just over a month. Then, in 2021, it backed that performance by delivering another 30,000% rally in a similarly short span of time. Here’s the kicker now : although Dogecoin’s maturity over the years has slashed the percentage gains on offer, it’s still the meme coin king. This means a Dogecoin rally could very well ignite a broader meme coin boom. And Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is arguably the best crypto to buy now if you want to fully capitalize on Dogecoin’s momentum. ‎ Understanding Maxi Doge’s Connection to Dogecoin What is Maxi Doge , you ask? Well, don’t mistake it for another overly ambitious new cryptocurrency project trying to associate itself with Dogecoin in hopes of outsized returns. Dogecoin’s distant cousin, Maxi Doge, is a breed apart. While Dogecoin hogged the limelight at every family gathering, Maxi sulked in a corner and dreamed up his revenge. He then took to the gym and channeled that envy to become the ultimate Doge nemesis — and now stands as a potential 1000x crypto opportunity for savvy investors. $MAXI’s Master Plan Is to Go Viral Of course, Maxi Doge’s mission to overthrow Dogecoin as the best meme coin on the planet is an uphill task. But Maxi has already taken the first steps toward this ambitious goal by crafting the perfect tokenomics. The developers have reserved a massive 40% of the total token supply for marketing. This allocation will fund high-ticket influencer collaborations, social media campaigns, and PR initiatives designed to promote $MAXI across the cryptocurrency landscape, enhancing both its visibility and hype. Additionally, $MAXI aims to create a thriving community. To achieve this, it’s offering exclusive holder-only trading events that will take place weekly, along with leaderboard rewards to engage and reward loyal investors. What’s more, the token doesn’t want to limit itself to CEX and DEX listings. It also plans to launch on futures platforms, further increasing its usability, particularly among meme coin traders who will be able to use $MAXI for high-leverage trading. Why You Shouldn’t Delay Your $MAXI Purchase Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is currently in presale, having already raised over $3.56M from early investors. Today, 1 $MAXI is available for just $0.0002625. Most importantly, institutional players are backing Maxi Doge to become the next crypto to explode . For instance, just this Saturday, two whales scooped up a total of $627K worth of $MAXI ( $314K & $313K ), so there’s no shortage of investor confidence in the project. Need help with the purchase process? Here’s our step-by-step guide on how to buy $MAXI . According to our Maxi Doge price prediction , the token could soar to $0.0024 by the end of 2025, delivering a chunky 814% return. Furthermore, if you exercise a little patience and hold on to Maxi Doge longer, it could generate over 2,100% ROI by the end of 2026, with the token projected to hit $0.0058. These life-changing gains could be yours only if you grab your $MAXI tokens now – while it’s still in presale and available at some of its lowest-ever prices. Back the new ‘Doge’ on the blockchain – buy $MAXI today. Disclaimer : Kindly do your own research before investing in crypto.

With the maturing market, investors are searching for projects that have good fundamentals and enormous growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been a project that has been gaining momentum. In Phase 6 of its presale, out of the 170 million tokens in this phase that have been earmarked, over 65% have been sold to date. Mutuum Finance has been able to raise over $17.25 million. As the presale gathers momentum, the value of the token will further increase, and Phase 7 will be worth $0.04, a near 15% appreciation from the current rate of $0.035. With its revolutionary approach and astounding presale performance, Mutuum Finance has emerged as a likely alternative among investors who are looking for a future blockbuster in the world of cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin market update: Watching key levels Dogecoin (DOGE) has been shaky and recently lost the $0.25 level to hit $0.19. If it holds to that level, DOGE may continue its gradual ascent, but a fall below $0.17 may induce a pullback to $0.10, testing investor patience. Otherwise, a breakout to $0.29 or higher can usher in renewed full-blown meme season, sending DOGE higher along with renewed euphoria. While traders carefully mark these key levels, many are looking to the upcoming altcoin in good form and fundamentals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), as a potential opportunity outside the realm of meme tokens. Mutuum Finance presale frenzy continues onward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the newest sensation in the DeFi sector, whose investor demand for the presale just seems to build momentum day by day. Existing presale stands at Phase 6, worth $0.035 per coin of MUTM, and has managed to achieve a value of over $17.25 million as a result of funding from over 16,910 investors. With over 65% sales during Phase 6, there is quite a small time for the investors to put their money into, reflecting the skyrocketing global confidence for the future prospects of the project as well as the decentralized finance potential. The pioneer investors will have tremendous potential profit when MUTM is launched into the open market. It will also launch an Ethereum blockchain-secured stablecoin that will be pegged to the USD. It is not an algorithmic coin that declines throughout the duration of the bear market, but over-collateralised and non-algorithmic, such that in the days of fluctuating markets, the token will be stable as well as dependable. Borrowing and lending protocol The platform will launch its next-gen lending and borrowing protocol , one of the most important releases for its DeFi platform. Version 1 will be rolled out on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include liquidity pools, mtTokens, and debt tokens, alongside a liquidator bot. The first digital currencies that will be covered for lending/borrowing, alongside collateralization, will be ETH and USDT and will provide users with a secure, user-friendly, alongside multi-asset DeFi experience. As Dogecoin (DOGE) heads towards $0.24, the majority of investors are now looking to other projects that have better fundamentals and growth prospects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already managed to collect more than $17.25 million from more than 16,910 investors in Phase 6 of its sale, and it has already sold 65% of tokens. Phase 7 will be triggered when it gets to $0.04. With its upcoming Sepolia Testnet lending and borrowing, liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and stablecoin support, MUTM has become a next-gen DeFi platform to be used for the long term. Potential investors looking for the next high-growth altcoin have to do it now to own Mutuum Finance tokens and become a member of this fast-growing ecosystem.

Traders were left reeling as leveraged bets throughout ETH, BTC, and other key altcoins were liquidated in a matter of a few minutes, stoking panic and a sell-off tsunami. ETH was severely hit in isolation, slumping more than 13% in a single day as sentiment became intensely bearish. In the midst of volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shines as a beacon of security and potentiality. Now in Phase 6 of its presale, having sold out more than 65% already, Mutuum Finance integrates a DeFi ecosystem thoughtfully designed, coupled with strong community support and a clear roadmap towards sustainable growth. While volatile fluctuations are reminiscent of other large coins like ETH, Mutuum Finance presents investors the opportunity to invest early in a token designed for utility, innovativeness, and long-term adoption, turning out to be among the best altcoins to invest in as the market struggles to rebound. Ethereum Price Forecast: ETH Back to Significant Support During Trading Volatility Ethereum (ETH) has decreased approximately 11%, falling below $4,000 in the midst of continued market volatility, but this correction remains no cause to panic. The asset is retesting a significant demand level, earlier resistance, now functioning as crucial support near $3,600, and $3,200 as a possible floor if larger macro trends further deteriorate. A reclamation of $4,200 would indicate a return to higher-timeframe optimism. On a near-term basis, stochastic volatility and optionality are king, and staking flows and ETF speculation are likely to have a larger impact than headlines. Broadly speaking, the uptrend remains, and ETH staying above this demand level may be the beginning of its next great run, a note that as the market retests key levels, forward-thinking investors are looking to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for portfolio diversification and possible gain. Rise of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) As we are in presale phase 6, a single MUTM token costs $0.035. Investor interest has yet to subside, as more than 16,910 investors are investing in the project to surpass $17.25 million. This kind of strong demand indicates further faith in the future prospects of a presale as well as the future prospects instilled in the company product, a decentralized finance product. The protocol obtains maximum efficiency of collateral by precisely calculated Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, virtually on undercollateralized loans. There is also shock buffer reserve set aside for market shock, and surer reserves are invested judiciously on risk-free holdings. The architecture provides shock-absorption ability without compromise on the overall health of the system with stable, strong, and sustainable DeFi platform. Borrowing and Lending Protocol Updated Version Mutuum Finance is building a futuristic lending and borrowing protocol . Sepolia Testnet will launch its first version in Q4 2025. The product will feature liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, liquidator bot, etc. both ETH and USDT will be able to be collateral for borrowing/lending and provide DeFi users with a fast, high-speed, and user-friendly DeFi experience. Mutuum Finance has also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program together with CertiK. It rewards white-hat hackers and security researchers who identify bugs in the codebase and report to it. Mutuum Finance Shines Through Ethereum Volatility Ethereum (ETH) dropped below $4,000 amid $19B in crypto liquidations, rattling the market. While ETH faces sharp swings, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains strong, with Phase 6 over 65% sold, $17.25M raised, and 16,910+ investors onboard. Its dual-lending DeFi model, precise Loan-to-Value ratios, and shock buffer reserves provide stability and long-term growth potential. With the upcoming lending and borrowing protocol on Sepolia Testnet Q4 2025, MUTM offers a secure, efficient, and user-friendly DeFi experience. Investors seeking a resilient altcoin should join the Mutuum Finance presale now before Phase 6 closes.

Bitcoin Core V30 Is Here The most disputed change in v30 is a policy update around OP_RETURN—the script path used for provably unspendable outputs that can carry arbitrary data. Bitcoin Core has raised the default -datacarriersize limit to 100,000 bytes and now permits multiple data-carrier (OP_RETURN) outputs in a single transaction for relay and mining. Crucially, node operators can still restore the previous behavior: “It can be overridden with -datacarriersize=83 to revert to the limit enforced in previous versions.” The aggregate size limit applies across all OP_RETURN outputs in a transaction. That default increase—functionally “uncapping” data carrier size because the transaction-size ceiling will be encountered first—has kicked off a broader argument about what kinds of activity Bitcoin’s policy layer should favor or discourage. Developers and node operators who back the change frame it as neutral plumbing that preserves operator choice; critics warn it invites more non-monetary inscriptions and potential spam , raising storage and validation burdens for the average node. Beyond OP_RETURN, v30 delivers a long list of network, wallet, and tooling updates. The P2P layer improves package relay so that common topologies like grandparent-parent-child or multi-parent-one-child can propagate more reliably when only one ancestor needs fee bumping. The transaction orphanage introduces stronger DoS limits based on total entries and weight across peers, replacing the now-retired -maxorphantx knob. Miners gain an experimental IPC mining interface accessible through a new umbrella bitcoin command that also provides convenience aliases—“bitcoin node,” “bitcoin gui,” and “bitcoin rpc”—without deprecating existing binaries. External signing on Windows is re-enabled, and the coinstats index has been reworked to avoid an overflow bug seen on default Signet, requiring a one-time resync of that index. Fee-policy defaults also shift. The minimum block feerate setting (-blockmintxfee) now defaults to 0.001 sat/vB, while both the minimum relay and incremental relay feerates default to 0.1 sat/vB. The notes stress that unless these lower defaults are broadly adopted, propagation and confirmation are not guaranteed; wallet feerates themselves are unchanged without explicit configuration. The OP_RETURN policy change has quickly spilled beyond developer channels into Bitcoin’s public discourse, with long-time contributors and publication editors lining up on both sides. While Bitcoin Core 30.0’s larger data-carrier default and allowance for multiple OP_RETURN outputs are viewed by proponents as policy neutral and adjustable at the node level; detractors see a vector for abuse that blurs the network’s monetary focus which could even spark a hard fork .

53075130,https://invezz.com/?p=2921398,1760340713,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Why MUTM is the crypto to buy as BTC crashes 8% to $112K,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/13/why-mutm-is-the-crypto-to-buy-as-btc-crashes-8-to-112k/,"Bitcoin has fallen 8% to $112,277 over the past day; traders are now watching an important support level of $110,000. This precipitous decline is due to President Donald Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, causing fears of a trade war and sending investors away from risky assets. As a result, the entire crypto market has lost 9.8% of its value, which has reduced the total value to $3.74 trillion. Ethereum lost 13.4% to $3,785, XRP and Solana lost 14.7% and 17.7%. Moreover, the crypto fear and greed index has fallen to 35, indicating that there is widespread fear. Yet, in the midst of this crypto crash, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting consistent interest as the crypto to buy now, as its presale progresses and real utility develops. Furthermore, on-chain data shows little selling from big holders, implying strength in the turmoil. Thus, this moment highlights the importance of why savvy investors look to projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for stability. Bitcoin’s sudden plunge President Trump announced the tariffs yesterday, and the markets reacted instantly with a risk-off mood. Bitcoin fell from its peaks, touching $112,277 with a strong US dollar. In addition, Ethereum fell even lower to its lowest point in more than a month, down 13.4% amidst the general panic. Solana and XRP were even harder hit with losses of 17.7% and 14.7%, respectively, and both BNB and Cardano lost more than 13%. Dogecoin crashed by more than 20% in a matter of hours. Consequently, we see that the price of cryptocurrencies today has a high level of volatility, with the fear and greed index at its lowest point during the summer. Analysts point out that often such shocks are followed by rebounds when the uncertainty dissipates. However, short-term pressures continue as the fear of supply chain amplifies the downturn. Therefore, Bitcoin tests $110,000 support, but long-term holders give no indication of panic sales. Mutuum Finance’s presale momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $17,250,000 since the presale began, and total MUTM holders now stand at 16,910. Phase 6 of 11 phases is underway, 65% filled at $0.035 per token. This price marks a 250% rise from the phase one level of $0.01. Consequently, phase 6 sells out fast, so chances to buy at this rate fade quickly. Afterwards, phase 7 opens with a 14.3% jump to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launches at $0.06, offering current buyers a 420% ROI post-launch. Furthermore, the team has announced its lending and borrowing protocol development. V1 deploys to Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, featuring a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and liquidator bot. Initial assets include ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral. Thus, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) builds real utility in the DeFi space. Mutuum Finance’s security advances The team has finalized its Certik audit successfully, earning a 90/100 token score that highlights strong security. In addition, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a bug bounty program with CertiK, allocating $50,000 USDT in rewards across four tiers: critical, major, minor, and low. Every vulnerability level receives targeted incentives. Moreover, the MUTM team introduced a dashboard tracking the top 50 holders, who earn bonus tokens for maintaining positions. Consequently, this fosters community engagement. Meanwhile, a major giveaway awards $100,000 in MUTM to 10 winners, each getting $10,000. Participants submit wallet addresses, complete quests, and invest at least $50 in the presale to qualify. Therefore, these steps solidify Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the crypto to buy now amid market jitters. Protocol’s lending mechanics Borrowers supply overcollateralization, and the system issues mtTokens for deposits that accrue interest. Lenders redeem these for assets plus yields anytime. In peer-to-contract mode, pools enable instant access with dynamic rates based on utilization. When supply abounds, rates stay low to spur borrowing; scarcity raises them to draw deposits. Furthermore, peer-to-peer allows custom terms for specific assets and durations. Stable rates lock in predictability, though they start higher and may rebalance if variables surge. Loan-to-value ratios cap borrowings at safe levels, like 75% for ETH. Liquidation triggers at 80% ensure quick resolutions with bonuses for liquidators. Thus, these features make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a practical choice for crypto investing. Gearing up for launch As Bitcoin’s crash eases, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the crypto to buy now, blending security with yield potential. Its presale progress and protocol innovations counter the downturn effectively. Investors find value in this steady ascent.

While Bitcoin and the majority of altcoins turned red, many altcoins, especially among the top 100 altcoins, lost more than 40% of their value in the last hour, attracting attention. As the cryptocurrency world tries to leave the great crash that occurred on Friday behind, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins have begun to recover. While Bitcoin surpassed $115,000 and Ethereum surpassed $4,100, Binance Coin (BNB), which stood out with its strong performance during the recent decline, made a name for itself again. BNB is on the rise again! BNB, which broke records in succession in the past weeks and reached a new ATH by exceeding $1,300, has now surpassed $1,300 again. Trading at $1,330, BNB has also surpassed Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin, in terms of market capitalization. BNB is currently the third largest cryptocurrency in the market, just behind Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a value of $185 billion. USDT became the fourth largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $179 billion. While many altcoins are still struggling to reach their pre-drop levels, BNB has surpassed those levels with a 15.7% surge in the last 24 hours. Why Is BNB So Strong? CZ Explained! While BNB attracts attention with its strong stance and unstoppable rise, Binance founder CZ made a new post about BNB. CZ stated that people often ask him, “Why is BNB so strong?” At this point, CZ said that BNB's success is due to the Binance team standing behind BNB and its users. “Some people ask why BNB is so strong? While others tried to ignore, hide, shift blame, or attack competitors, key players in the BNBChain ecosystem (Binance, Venus, and more) put hundreds of millions of dollars out of their own pockets to PROTECT USERS.

World Liberty Financial price prediction for 2025 expects the price of WLFI to surge toward $0.41. By 2031, we expect the World Liberty Financial price to record a maximum price of $1.4. Donald Trump has embraced the title of the “crypto president”, a label that has fueled massive speculation across the crypto industry. After Trump’s 2024 election victory, the price of Bitcoin surged, a move many analysts and traders called a bullish signal for the broader cryptocurrency market. Building on this momentum, Trump introduced his own branded tokens—most notably the $TRUMP token and $MELANIA memecoin—cementing his direct involvement in the world of digital assets. Whether Trump’s push into crypto is driven by policy goals or personal profit, one message is clear: he intends to make cryptocurrency part of both his political strategy and financial portfolio. However, Trump’s personal involvement in crypto tokens raises critical ethical questions. If a sitting or future U.S. president profits directly from token sales, DeFi projects, or blockchain ventures, it risks blurring the line between public duty and private gain. One project drawing major attention is World Liberty Financial after major listings, a Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. This article explores what World Liberty Financial is, and what Trump’s embrace of crypto could mean for the future of Bitcoin, memecoins, and U.S. crypto policy. Consequently, numerous analysts eagerly anticipate the future valuation of its native cryptocurrency, WLFI. This raises the question: Can WLFI price reach $1? This forecast for World Liberty Financial’s price examines factors such as ecosystem trends, adoption rates, underlying technology, and technical analysis to project the WLFI price prediction from 2025 to 2031.

Currently, the bulls are aiming for a recovery. WLFI price chart prediction: World Liberty Financial faces buying pressure toward $0.14 WLFI price is facing a surge as buyers push the price above $0.14. WLFI price is aiming for a hold above the immediate Fib channels. The 24-hour volume surged toward $84 million, showing increased interest in trading activity. The price is trading at $0.143, surging over 18% in the last 24 hours. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The RSI-14 trend line has surged from its previous level but trades below the midline at level 35, suggesting selling pressure. WLFI/USD 4-hour price chart: Bears aim for a hold below EMA trend lines The 4-hour WLFI price chart suggests WLFI continues to experience bearish activity around EMA lines, creating a negative sentiment on the price chart. As the price continues to face resistance near the Fib level, bears prepare for a domination by holding the price below the EMA20 trend line. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView The BoP indicator trades in a negative region at 0.79, hinting that sellers are trying to build pressure near resistance levels and boost a downward correction. The MACD trend line has formed red candles below the signal line, hinting at a selling pressure.

However, if WLFI’s price successfully breaks above $0.1623, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.2178. WLFIUSDT chart by TradingView If bulls cannot initiate a surge, WLFI’s price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.1167, resulting in a correction to $0.0737. WLFI crypto news World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto venture linked to the Trump family, sold part of its locked token holdings to Bitcoin mining firm Hut 8 for inclusion in the latter’s long-term crypto reserve. Though WLFI didn’t specify the amount, on-chain data suggests about 100 million tokens were sold at $0.25 each, totaling roughly $25 million. WLFI recently sold tokens at $0.25 to Hut8 for their treasury. The locked tokens sent from the WLFI treasury were simply to satisfy that sale — not new issuance, not dilution. We appreciate Hut8’s support as a long-term partner. 🦅 — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) October 3, 2025 Is WLFI a good investment? Trading $WLFI will be very risky. Since it’s a new and highly hyped token with only a small amount available at launch, the price could change quickly and unpredictably. Liquidity will be thin, so even one big trade might move the market. It’s normal for tokens like this to surge at launch and then drop as early buyers cash out. However, considering its background and ongoing trading volume, WLFI can turn out to be a good investment option in the long-term. Why is the WLFI price up today? Sellers failed to maintain demand around $0.1 level, resulting in an upward correction. What is the WLFI price prediction for 2025? By 2025, analysts predict that World Liberty Financial (WLFI) will start the year at $0.15, with an average trading price of $0.37, and could climb as high as $0.41. Will WLFI price touch $1? Yes, WLFI price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2030. However, the token might attain this level much earlier, depending on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will WLFI Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and WLFI gains recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2040. Is WLFI a good long-term investment? As World Liberty Financial aims to expand its offerings, it might gain a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, WLFI can be a good long-term investment option. The WLFI long term price outlook is looking strong due to its strong political support. WLFI price prediction October 2025 Analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices in October month. We expect WLFI to record a minimum price of $0.15 and a maximum price of $0.3, with an average of $0.2 in October.

WLFI Prediction for 2028 By 2028, forecasts suggest WLFI will open at $0.7, trade at an average of $0.8, and could move up to $0.81. This consistent upward trend shows that the token could be strengthening its position in the market. World Liberty Financial Price Prediction 2029 By 2029, analysts expect WLFI to begin at $0.72, maintain an average price of $0.83, and rise toward $0.86. Even though the forecast mirrors the previous year’s outlook, price stability could signal resilience in an often volatile crypto market. WLFI Crypto Price Forecast for 2030 By 2030, experts predict WLFI will start at $0.89, trade at an average of $0.96, and potentially reach $1.02. Crossing the one-dollar mark would be a significant psychological milestone for investors and a strong indicator of growth.

This represents a healthy climb from 2025, showing that WLFI is gaining traction in the crypto space. WLFI historic price sentiment WLFI Price History The $WLFI governance token for World Liberty Financial, the Trump family–backed DeFi platform, launched for public trading and token claims on September 1, 2025, at 12:00 UTC.

ZEC is back above $286 on signs of deliberate buying. ZCash (ZEC) resumed its growth, standing above $286 in the new week. The token was almost unaffected by the weekend market crash, instead showing signs of robust buying. ZEC recovered to over $286 on Monday, later slipping to $278.20. The privacy coin had more subdued trading volumes as crypto market participants still reeled from the weekend’s liquidations. ZEC saw volumes of just under $1B for the past day. The ZEC recovery still supports the overall trend of privacy coins , as many of those assets are in the green. However, XMR and LTC took a step back, reflecting the general altcoin slump. For some analysts, the ZEC rally may be over, but the coin has shown significant strength. Is a mysterious whale buying ZEC? One of the reasons for the ZEC rally was special attention from influencers. ZEC was the only ticker directly mentioned by investor Naval Ravikant for the past few years, as he decided to talk about cryptography and privacy. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, the renewed interest in ZEC brought the coin back to levels not see since 2018. The recent wave of buying is also raising suggestions that the recent influencers are putting their money where their mouth is and re-accumulating ZEC. The recent ZEC expansion followed the latest tweet from Naval Ravikant, reiterating the demand for privacy. Crypto is… Desperate gamblers chasing their first bag. Investors funding the buildout of the global casino. Bankers hypnotizing the masses to collect their vig. …all meaningless and ephemeral without the cypherpunks, who defend the dream of encrypted and unstoppable cash. — Naval (@naval) October 11, 2025 ZEC is showing signs of accumulation that go beyond short-term market fluctuations. One of the signs is the growth of ZEC locked with maximum privacy, already taking up 26.36% of the total supply. ZEC is flowing into the shielded Orchard pool, showing growing demand for privacy. | Source: ZEC Hub Dashboard . The supply of ZEC in the Orchard Shielded Pool is also going vertical, signaling that the privacy narrative is taken seriously. The recent talk about crypto surveillance accelerated the inflow into Orchard Pool, making it one of the biggest holdings of ZEC. Retail buyers flock to Zashi wallet ZEC still rises on a mix of retail buying and some derivative speculation. Even after the recent market shakedown, open interest for ZEC recovered to over $256M. However, the more interesting trend for ZEC is the activity on Near Protocol and Zashi Wallet. More retail traders are moving into ZEC through decentralized accumulation. ZEC buying accelerated on Near Intents, going through the Zashi app. More retail buyers also used decentralized swaps to acquire untraceable ZEC. | Source: Dune Analytics . Activity on Near Intents shows ZEC buying accelerated in October, allowing for direct withdrawals to Zashi wallet. The end goal is to acquire more ZEC in an untraceable manner, and disconnect the token from any records and identities on centralized exchanges. The Zashi app started its decentralized swaps in early October, adding to the potential for re-accumulating ZEC. The addition of the Zashi wallet option also boosted overall ZEC usage , with a growth in all types of transfers. ZCash has been positioning to work as a simple payment coin, similar to Venmo, though with shielded transactions. For the first time, ZEC is gaining a new use case, veiled P2P retail transfers that are untraceable. The Near ecosystem is one of the hubs for switching between non-privacy coins and tokens into ZEC.

53074644,https://cryptonews.com/?p=436878,1760341783,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53074644.jpeg,Fast Food Chain Steak ‘n Shake Halts Ether Payment Plan After Bitcoin Fans Push Back,https://cryptonews.com/news/steak-n-shake-halts-ether-payment-plan/,"Steak ‘n Shake has scrapped plans to accept Ether (ETH) payments after a backlash from Bitcoin supporters, highlighting the ongoing tribal divide within the crypto community. Key Takeaways: Steak ‘n Shake canceled its Ether payment plan after Bitcoin supporters criticized the move. The fast-food chain’s loyalty to Bitcoin follows a 15% sales boost since adopting BTC payments. Vitalik Buterin said crypto businesses should commit to one community instead of appealing to all. The 90-year-old American fast-food chain, which began accepting Bitcoin in May, ran a poll on X asking its 468,800 followers if it should expand its crypto payment options to include Ether. Steak ‘n Shake Suspends Ether Poll, Declares Loyalty to Bitcoiners The poll drew nearly 49,000 votes, with 53% in favor. However, just four hours later, the company abruptly halted the vote, declaring loyalty to Bitcoiners. “Poll suspended. Our allegiance is with Bitcoiners. You have spoken,” Steak ‘n Shake posted , signaling a retreat from the idea. The chain’s relationship with Bitcoiners has been lucrative. Since introducing BTC payments in the U.S., France, Monaco, and Spain, Steak ‘n Shake reported a 15% year-over-year increase in same-store sales during the third quarter. Executives credited Bitcoiners’ support for the rise, which may explain the brand’s cautious response to criticism. Poll suspended. Our allegiance is with Bitcoiners. You have spoken. Who even allowed this? I'm back at my desk. – Steaktoshi https://t.co/4RkASUVa8L — Steak 'n Shake (@SteaknShake) October 12, 2025 Prominent Bitcoin advocates were quick to condemn the ETH poll. Adam Simecka, creator of the self-custody wallet Manna, vowed never to dine at the restaurant again if it accepted Ether. “The fact that you even created the ETH poll is disappointing,” added influencer Colleen, known as The Bitcoin Gal. Developer Carman said the move had already damaged the company’s reputation among Bitcoin loyalists. The episode underscores how deeply entrenched crypto tribalism remains. Bitcoin purists continue to argue that BTC is the only true form of sound digital money — echoing Michael Saylor’s famous line, “There is no second-best crypto asset.” They have credibility on my eyes due to Bitcoin and tallow. — Ben Justman (@BenJustman) October 11, 2025 Interestingly, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin offered a nuanced take , suggesting that businesses adopting crypto should commit to one community rather than trying to please everyone. “We need the stubborn ones who believe in their cause and their tribe,” he said. Despite the controversy, Steak ‘n Shake appears to be doubling down on its Bitcoin identity. The company announced plans to launch a “Bitcoin Steakburger” on October 16 to celebrate its embrace of BTC. Payments Companies Push into Crypto In May, crypto payments platform Mesh unveiled its Apple Pay integration , which allows merchants partnered with Mesh to accept crypto payments via Apple Pay. Mesh’s partnership with Apple Pay came as payments companies continue to expand into digital assets. In April, global payments giant Stripe said it is developing a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin aimed at companies operating outside the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe. The announcement came after Stripe’s regulatory approval to acquire Bridge, a stablecoin payments network designed to rival traditional banking systems and SWIFT-based transfers. Earlier this year, Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO and outspoken Bitcoin advocate, publicly urged Signal Messenger to integrate Bitcoin for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments. Dorsey’s call was echoed by David Marcus, former president of PayPal and current CEO of Lightspark, who stated that “all non-transactional apps should connect to Bitcoin.” The post Fast Food Chain Steak ‘n Shake Halts Ether Payment Plan After Bitcoin Fans Push Back appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Payment,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-13 07:49:43

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/peter-brandt-flips-bullish-on-xrp-bitcoin-xlm-and-ethereum-heres-why/,"In a recent post, veteran trader Peter Brandt shared his latest chart analysis of several major cryptocurrencies. The long-time market analyst accompanied his commentary with technical charts for XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), Stellar (XLM), and Ethereum (ETH), offering insight into how Brandt currently views the technical posture of several leading digital assets. A few final posts for the weekend, then I will leave you youngsters with your dreams $XRP – just a minor reaction in bigger theme of things $BTC – bull still alive and well $XLM – a bull waking from a nap $ETH – ready to rock and roll If I change my mind I won't let you know pic.twitter.com/rL1nVETYSn — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 11, 2025 XRP’s Pause Within a Larger Structure Brandt described XRP as experiencing “just a minor reaction in [the] bigger theme of things.” His chart for XRP shows a monthly formation resembling a large symmetrical consolidation pattern that has unfolded since 2018. The asset broke out of this triangle in late 2024, after a massive surge that sent it up by over 500%. However, it has struggled recently. A few days ago, Brandt said he would short XRP based on what he identified as a descending triangle. The market dipped shortly afterward , aligning with that view. Despite this decline, the latest update suggests that he sees the price dip as a smaller retracement within a continuing technical structure rather than a complete breakdown. XRP remains above its long-term rising support line, indicating that despite near-term weakness, Brandt continues to monitor a broader range-bound phase rather than a decisive bearish shift. Bitcoin Maintaining Its Uptrend For Bitcoin, Brandt noted that the bulls are “still alive and well.” The weekly view shows BTC maintaining a consistent series of higher lows since late 2022, with the price currently trading above a long-term ascending trendline. Volume patterns remain steady, and the asset continues to respect key moving averages. While Bitcoin has seen several sharp corrections during its recent cycle, Brandt’s latest assessment suggests that he views these pullbacks as normal within an ongoing uptrend. His brief statement reflects confidence in the structure of the chart and implies that BTC has not yet violated critical technical levels that would negate its bullish setup. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XLM and ETH Show Signs of Renewal Brandt called XLM “a bull waking from a nap,” noting its triangular consolidation and gradual buildup of higher lows since 2020. The pattern remains contained but suggests developing strength if resistance breaks. Ethereum, labeled as “ready to rock and roll,” shows a steady consolidation within an ascending channel that has persisted for years. The asset’s price continues to test resistance while maintaining support, reflecting a constructive structure. Together, both charts indicate markets that have stabilized after long periods of sideways trading, with Brandt signaling cautious optimism for potential upward movement if current technical formations hold.

The Dutch government utilized the Goods Availability Act in September to acquire Nexperia. Under the law, officials can stop or reverse major business decisions, and the government stated that it acted because Nexperia exhibited serious and urgent management problems. Dutch government seizes Nexperia for security reasons Dutch government officials stated that Nexperia exhibited signs of poor management , which could have ripple effects on the company’s ability to safeguard important chipmaking knowledge, designs, and equipment within Europe. The Goods Availability Act allowed the government to prevent Nexperia from making any major business changes for a period of one year. Nexperia cannot sell parts of its company, change its top management, or restructure its operations without permission from policymakers. However, Nexperia can still manufacture and sell chips as usual, so its workers and clients are not affected; however, all important business decisions will be under strict supervision. Officials in The Hague did not specify the problems with Nexperia, but their statement indicated they had deep concerns about how the Chinese parent company, Wingtech, managed its European operations. Experts say the Goods Availability Act is only used in emergencies, such as when the government needs to secure supplies of food, fuel, or medicine during a crisis. However, using it for a semiconductor company highlights just how important the Netherlands views chips as, comparable to energy or defense materials. Analysts say other Chinese-owned companies in Europe will likely be more careful about how they operate. It could also prompt European governments to introduce new rules that make it more difficult for foreign buyers to acquire full control of companies that develop or design advanced technology. Wingtech faces more global setbacks Wingtech has been facing growing resistance from Western governments as it tries to expand its reach in the global chip industry. The company, based in China, acquired the Dutch chipmaker Nexperia in 2018 for approximately $3.6 billion, aiming to establish a strong international presence and compete with the world’s largest semiconductor companies. The company’s troubles in foreign markets grew slowly. Still, they became too much to ignore in 2022, when the British government ordered Wingtech to reverse its takeover of the United Kingdom’s largest microchip factory, Newport Wafer Fab. The British authorities stated that reviews indicated the acquisition might pose risks to national security and the country’s ability to produce critical chips independently. In 2023, Wingtech also found itself on the U.S. Entity List . This list is a trade blacklist that limits how American firms can conduct business with foreign companies deemed to be security risks. These restrictions made it extremely difficult for Wingtech to acquire the advanced machines, chips, and design tools it needed from U.S. suppliers, which in turn harmed the relationship with partners and clients in Western markets. The pressure on the company increased in 2025 when a senior Nexperia executive filed a court petition in the Netherlands, requesting an investigation into the company’s management. The petition alleged that there were serious issues within the company and requested temporary measures to ensure the safety of its operations. The Dutch court responded by suspending Wingtech’s founder, Zhang Xuezheng, from all his roles at Nexperia until the investigation is completed. Nexperia continues to operate despite these difficulties, and major automotive brands and consumer electronics companies across Europe and other regions still use its chips. Factories are still operating, workers are still employed, and products are still being shipped, but there is now considerable uncertainty regarding the company’s ownership. Analysts say that Wingtech’s experience is now a symbol of the growing tension between China’s global business ambitions and the West’s determination to protect its technological independence. What began as a normal business expansion has evolved into a complex web of politics, trade restrictions, and security concerns that now extend far beyond the company itself.

CAKE rallies on renewed optimism PancakeSwap’s native token exhibited a bullish structure today. It has gained more than 25% in the previous 24 hours to $3.53. Chart by CoinMarketCap CAKE has rebounded from last week’s low of around $1.90. Broad-based recoveries after the latest crash and optimistic announcements propel CAKE’s performance. On-chain metrics and technical indicators suggest more rallies for the altcoin. CAKE exhibits a solid support zone at $3.0, which could catalyse stable rallies to the short-term target of $4.20. That would mean a nearly 20% increase from its market price. The digital coin can extend to $6 and clear the road to $10 amid market-wide bull runs.

That sudden drop now has analysts making comparisons to the infamous crypto crash of March 2020, raising the question: Is this drop the start of a bigger crash or a reset before another rise? A Psychological Echo Across Cycles The reasons for the two crashes are different: the 2020 global pandemic and the 2025 macro tariff announcements . However, the emotional response seems to be the same. Investor Ted Pillows was among those who likened the Friday shocker to the 2020 occurrence, overlaying BTC charts to compare the two price drops and arguing that such sharp reversals signaled cycle bottoms rather than tops. Similarly, market commentator Simon Dedic wrote on October 12 about the parallel, saying, “Every cycle has that one moment where fear hits harder than logic.” He went on to say that while the recent price movements were similar to the panic of 2020, it was only in terms of market psychology, not fundamentals. In that earlier event, assets like Ethereum (ETH) lost almost 70% of their value in just a few days, giving way to a paradoxical historic expansion. According to Dedic, from those lows, “$ETH did a 50x from the bottom, while major alts like $BNB and $ADA delivered well over 100x returns.” His analysis suggests that if this is a similar capitulatory bottom for altcoins, the next 12 to 18 months could produce life-changing gains for those who maintain conviction. However, the main background is completely different. The 2020 crash led to unprecedented global monetary stimulus and zero interest rates, which were like rocket fuel for speculative assets. In the current environment, inflation is still high, and central banks are putting in place restrictive policies that could make it hard for there to be a repeat of that liquidity-driven explosion. The price behavior of Bitcoin itself also tells a different story. As noted by pseudonymous analyst CryptoAmsterdam in a recent social media thread, Bitcoin is much further along in the market cycle than it was in early 2020. Back then, the main cryptocurrency was trying to get back to a key range low early in its cycle. Now, it’s in a later stage and has already set new all-time highs. Even though it fell sharply, it didn’t change the overall structure of the market. Altcoins: The Crucible of Opportunity The most compelling comparisons lie not with Bitcoin, but with the altcoin market. According to the same analysis from CryptoAmsterdam, several altcoin charts are showing patterns that are reminiscent of Bitcoin’s position just before its post-COVID rally. Many are completing a “range low reclaim” followed by a “violent shake out dump,” creating what looks like a final bear trap before a potential upward move. The market watcher was careful to clarify that this is a macro observation for bias-forming, not a direct buy signal, advising traders to “wait for a structure to form where you can work with — a setup with a trigger and invalidation.” This technical perspective is also strengthened by shifting market dynamics. Key indicators like Bitcoin dominance are showing early signs of cracking, while the Ethereum/Bitcoin pair has reclaimed a critical macro level. This often signals capital is beginning to rotate away from the number one crypto and toward higher-risk assets, a sign observers believe is a precursor to an altseason. For investors, the central question becomes one of faith in the underlying technology. As Dedic framed it, one must choose between believing strong altcoins are dead or viewing this space as the foundation for “the next generation of billion-dollar companies.” The post Analysts See 2020 Parallels in Crypto’s $19B Market Washout appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto News|Top News|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|ALTCOIN|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-13 09:12:53

The latest edition reveals that, despite Bitcoin and gold pushing to new highs, derivatives indicators point to lingering caution beneath the surface. Key Highlights Bitcoin reaches $125K while perpetual open interest lags below September levels. ETH reversal sparks bearish options skew of −3.3%. Volatility edges higher but remains historically muted. Decentralized perpetuals surpass $1T in monthly volume in September 2025, led by Aster. Perpetual swap open interest has declined since the rally, signaling profit-taking rather than fresh conviction. Despite Bitcoin’s new peak at $125,000 and Ethereum briefly touching $4,700, open interest remains below mid-September levels and continues to retreat. Options activity mirrors this cautious tone, with volumes skewed toward puts and volatility still far from euphoric highs. The recent BTC and gold surge, often framed as the “debasement trade,” has yet to translate into stronger derivatives positioning. Implied and realized volatility rose only modestly, with one-week BTC volatility holding below 40% — a sign of tempered market sentiment despite record spot prices. In contrast, decentralized exchanges continue to post strong growth. September marked the first time perpetual DEXs crossed $1 trillion in monthly volume, with Aster emerging as a standout. Its ASTER token surged from $0.10 to $2.30 within a week of its September 17 debut, outperforming peers such as HYPE. The platform’s forthcoming Layer 1 launch and Pro Mode, which supports hidden limit orders, reflect the rising appetite for innovation and privacy in trading infrastructure.

Offering tokens at $0.012 each, the project has already raised substantial funds and distributed over 934 million tokens. This investment opportunity is not just about buying tokens; it's about being part of a pioneering technological advance. How Does the $500 Investment Work? Investing $500 during the presale phase secures approximately 41,666 Ozak AI tokens. Should the value reach the conservative estimate of $1.00 per token by 2026, the initial investment could exponentially grow to over $41,666. Even if the token hits lower milestones like $0.10 or $0.50, the returns are significant, multiplying the original investment by 8 to 40 times respectively. Current Presale Dynamics Ozak AI's presale is progressing swiftly, currently in its 6th round. Early investors grab tokens at lower prices, which have escalated from the initial offering to $0.012, reflecting growing interest and valuation. This phase covers 30 percent of the 10 billion total supply, showing the urgency and potential scarcity that could drive future prices up.

Key Features Powering Ozak AI Ozak AI integrates blockchain with artificial intelligence to enhance market predictions and analytics. Through partnerships with platforms like the Pyth Network and Dex3, it provides real-time market data and improved trading solutions.

Distinguishing Factors of Ozak AI Unlike mainstream cryptocurrencies, Ozak AI offers an affordable entry point with substantial growth potential. This makes it an attractive option for both novice and seasoned investors. The utility of its AI-driven analytics and the robust ecosystem offer real value beyond mere speculation. Conclusion A $500 investment in Ozak AI during its presale could potentially yield returns surpassing $41,666 by 2026, supported by strategic growth, powerful technology integration, and increasing investor interest.

As the project has already collected over 3.6 million funds and sold more than 934 million tokens, Ozak AI is poised to deliver an unprecedented upside, supported by advanced AI and blockchain integration, significant partnerships, and innovative ecosystem features. This article decomposes the mathematics of how to invest a small amount of money, like $500, and get a potential of up to $41,666 or even more in a span of one year, the critical elements of the platform, and pertinent presale information. The Math Behind the 500 Investment In the sixth presale phase, when the price stands at $0.012, a $500 investment will yield a figure of about 41,666 Ozak AI tokens. Analysts have commonly estimated that this stake would be worth 80x the investment, as Ozak AI was projected to have a conservative target price of $1.00 in 2026. Bolder projections propose a price of over $1 and some up to $1.20 or even more, which will be equivalent to over 50,000 dollars out of the original 500 dollars. Even cheaper value milestones lead to significant returns: when the price reaches $0.10, the investment would increase over eight times, to 4,166, and with a $0.50 valuation, it increases to more than 20,833. This unequal potential is one of the examples of the great growth opportunities that presale projects such as Ozak AI can have in contrast to traditional cryptocurrencies. Revised Presale Situation and Prices Ozak AI is at the 6th round of presale , with each token costing $0.012. Up to this point, it has sold more than 934 million tokens and received more than 3.6 million dollars from its initial excited investors. Presale token sale will constitute 30 percent of the entire 10 billion supply, and the following round of the presale will raise the price to $0.014 and subsequently to $0.016. After presale, the market launch prices will be expected to begin significantly higher, which proves the argument of the significant ROI for early supporters. The presale configuration brings a sense of urgency to the investors, and they can join at the lower price while valuations increase with more adoption. Major Characteristics that are Motivating the Ozak AI Value Ozak AI uses blockchain technology to combine artificial intelligence and provide investors with predictive financial market signals and advanced analytics. By integrating data from the Pyth Network , early adopters can get access to real-time market data, including decentralized, high-quality financial feeds across more than 100 blockchains. Dex3 is also used to support the platform through the delivery of better liquidity solutions and trading experiences. Its live Ozak AI Rewards Hub also provides user engagement, providing staking programs, governance participation, and reward mechanisms, which encourage long-term community participation. Other technical products consist of one-click AI upgrades through SINT, voice interface, cross-chain bridges, and no-code integration tools with Weblume, which is accessible to both first-time and expert investors with an interest in high-tech market products. Strategic Alliances in favour of Sustainability Extensive partnerships of Ozak AI show its desire to build a sustainable and scale-based ecosystem. The cooperation with Pyth Network will guarantee the availability of real-time and reliable data needed in making AI-driven decisions. Collaboration with Dex3 will increase the fluidity of the trading, which is needed to gain the confidence of the investor and develop the market. Ozak AI can become a strong partner of these leading blockchain developers and offer high-quality staking and governance through the Rewards Hub, which will become a stable platform of adoption and future price growth. These alliances are the foundational basis of the innovative technology stack of the platform and the originality of Ozak AI over other speculative tokens that do not have such infrastructure. Why Ozak AI Is Unique Compared to Other Investments Ozak AI provides an affordable but potentially very lucrative offer to newcomers in contrast to popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which are expensive to join and have lower growth rates. The combination of the current low price of the token and the ability to engage in meaningful exposure with relatively small capital, and the predictive power of AI and the design of the ecosystem, presents tangible utilities other than speculation. There are also staking and governance options that allow early investors to influence the development of a project, which is often centralized and far-off from other larger blockchain projects. A combination of low costs, technology, and incentives of the community makes a compelling investment environment for smaller investors with the possibility of high upside. Conclusion A presale investment of Ozak AI at a price equal to $0.012 would yield a profit value of up to 41,666 or more in the year 2026 should the project meet the price milestones as stipulated by the project forecast. Powerful presale movement, excellent strategic cooperation with Pyth Network and Dex3, and functionality-rich platform products such as Rewards Hub, AI market signals, and smooth integration tools distinguish Ozak AI in the saturated crypto market. Having a clear roadmap and the increasing interest of investors, Ozak AI will provide the first-mover investors with an opportunity to take advantage of the intersection of AI and blockchain technologies and possibly experience life-changing returns in a rather short period of time.

The asset moved from $2.37 to $2.59, adding roughly $30 billion to its market value. Meanwhile, trading volume rose 17% to $9.6 billion as large buyers stepped in following a tariff-driven selloff. Long-Term Pattern Suggests Higher Targets A chart shared by ChartNerd shows XRP breaking out of a multi-year triangle pattern, which began forming in 2018 and saw a clean breakout in late 2023. Since then, Ripple’s token has followed a curved support path, which has held across several key price levels. Based on this structure, price projections are placed at $14 and $28. These targets come from commonly used Fibonacci extension levels (1.414 and 1.618). Source: ChartNerd/X Notably, the chart also shows a flag forming in 2024–2025, which often acts as a pause before a trend continues. If the price moves above this flag, the path toward the higher targets could open up between 2026 and 2028. Weekly Close Holds Above Trendline XRP ended last week above a key rising trendline that has been in place since late 2024. This line has acted as support through several price swings. CryptoBull commented, #XRP closed the week above year long uptrend. Extremely bullish! pic.twitter.com/Y0TZai7YPM — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) October 13, 2025 The long lower wick on the candle suggests that buyers stepped in quickly after the drop. The strong bounce back and a rise in trading volume point to a possible shift in momentum. Short-Term Chart Still Faces Resistance On the 4-hour chart, XRP has moved back above the 20 EMA, now sitting at $2.56. This shows early signs of strength after the recent selloff. The asset is now holding at around $2.60. However, XRP still trades below the 50 EMA ($2.69), 100 EMA ($2.79), and 200 EMA ($2.86). These moving averages are often seen as short-term resistance. A clear move above them would signal a stronger recovery. Until that happens, caution remains in place. Source: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is presently near the 51 mark, which is an increase from a value below 30 given two days ago. The momentum is getting better as indicated by a value above 50. The price staying above $2.60 has resulted in this bounce back of the RSI. In case XRP breaks resistance in the near future, the RSI might keep going up. For now, the trend is still unclear; however, the fast recovery has made the asset noticeable again.

The new release reflects years of community input and technical refinements designed to keep the Bitcoin network strong and efficient. According to the official website, Bitcoin Core remains an open-source project that ensures the stable operation of Bitcoin’s main client. Thousands of users contribute feedback, while a small team of maintainers implements and reviews updates to ensure reliability and decentralization. Key Improvements in Bitcoin Core 30.0 Bitcoin Core 30.0 introduces several significant changes: Obsolete signature operations are now limited to 2,500 per standard transaction. The default -datacarriersize parameter is now 100,000 bytes . Multiple OP_RETURN outputs are now supported, allowing more non-financial data in transactions. The orphan transaction buffer was redesigned to improve DoS resistance. A new command-line feature allows launching other executables for better usability. External signature support has been re-added for Windows users. Mining IPC interface support (e.g., for Stratum v2) was added through a new command. The coinstatsindex implementation was updated. Numerous RPC changes were made for improved flexibility. Legacy BDB wallets can no longer be created or downloaded but can be migrated using the migratewallet tool. Migration from Qt 5 to Qt 6 was completed, bringing dark mode on Windows and Metal backend support on macOS. With this release, branches 27.x and earlier have officially reached End of Life (EOL) status. The Most Controversial Change: OP_RETURN Limit Raised Among all updates, the increase in the OP_RETURN limit stands out as the most debated. Version 30.0 expands the limit from 80 bytes to 100,000 bytes, enabling larger non-financial transactions — such as those used in the Runes standard. Supporters, including early developer Peter Todd, argue that this change simplifies existing mechanisms and supports innovation. Critics, including cryptography pioneer Nick Szabo, warn it could bloat the blockchain with non-essential or even illegal data. Szabo has suggested Bitcoin Knots, an alternative client, as a temporary safeguard. “This limit increase invites developers to push more non-financial data,” Szabo noted. “Without proper tools to remove illegal content, node operators may face risks.” Todd countered that such concerns are exaggerated, stating the network already accommodates such data — the update merely streamlines the process. What This Means for Bitcoin’s Future Bitcoin Core 30.0 signals a new phase of greater flexibility and modernized infrastructure. From user interface improvements to deep protocol upgrades, this release sets the foundation for the next wave of Bitcoin innovation — while reigniting one of the community’s oldest debates about what Bitcoin should be.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|FORKS|BLOCKCHAIN|MINING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-13 09:18:32

Over 1.6 million traders were affected as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana tanked to multi-week lows. Longs covered almost $16.75 billion, shorts $2.47 billion, and the biggest single liquidation, an Ethereum-USDT position via Hyperliquid worth $203 million, shows the extent of the rout. Bitcoin dropped to near $101,000 but stabilized near $112,000, while Ethereum decreased 13% to $3,814, and BTC and ETH alone covered nearly $10 billion worth of liquidated positions. Solana, XRP, and Cardano also dropped 15-20%, prompting a liquidation of billions of longs. Risk appetite vanished across the market as a rush to exit saw a level of volatility befitting one of the most dramatic events in crypto history. Amid this chaos, opportunity emerges for those who can spot quality undervalued assets. While established cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin (DOGE) remain prominent, attention is shifting to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , currently in Phase 6 of its presale, with over 65% already sold out. With a token price of $0.035, raised over $17.25 million, and more than 16,910 holders, MUTM is performing well. Its innovative DeFi ecosystem, structured presale, and community-driven roadmap position it as a standout investment for traders seeking upside in the wake of this historic market crash. Dogecoin Holds onto Key Thresholds Despite Meme Psychology Dogecoin (DOGE) witnessed its meme-led liquidity retreat, underscoring volatile characteristics of social-led assets. Significant levels to focus on are still $0.28 for a breakout and $0.17–$0.19 as support. Traders are watching for the next moves, keeping in mind that meme coins primarily operate based on sentiment and must never become core positions. Though DOGE’s social engines can resuscitate fast advances, investors are gradually looking towards projects having better-defined fundamentals and growth prospects, a sector where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being increasingly looked towards. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Mutuum Finance is getting strong uproar amongst DeFi investors with its presale where over 16,910 investors have been enrolled to have raised over $17.25 million to-date. Phase 6 where the price of the token is at $0.035 is already sold out 65%. The level is seeing strong demand from investors. Lending and Borrowing Protocol The protocol will be releasing their brand-new lending and borrowing protocol as per a recent announcement. The initial version will go live on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 of 2025 and will have the underlying feature sets including the liquidity pools, the mtTokens, the debt tokens, and the liquidator bot. ETH as well as USDT will be supported for collaterals, for lending, and also for the borrowing, and the final outcome will be a seamless, multi-asset, and secure DeFi experience. In order to balance proportionate with secure lending, the protocol uses risk-adjusted Loan-to-Value (LTV), with the maximum collateral per asset depending on the risk level. The protocol also uses buffer reserves where riskier properties are required to hold larger reserves. This approach insulates the users from the volatility from the market as well as overall health of the ecosystem, so the platform will be surprised but will not affect the health. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands Strong Priced at $0.035 in Phase 6, MUTM is 65% sold out with $17.25M raised, and 16,910+ investors. By having a dual-lending approach, risk-balanced LTV, and buffer reserves, it stabilizes. With Sepolia Testnet (Q4 2025) launch for the lending protocol, MUTM gives a scalable, secure DeFi opportunity. Join the presale prior to Phase 6 closing.

The Australian government will back down on taxing unrealized gains, index the AUD 3 million threshold, increase the rates on earnings for super balances between AUD 3 million and AUD 10 million to 30%, and those of super balances above AUD 10 million to 40%. Chalmers also disclosed that the government will increase the low-income superannuation tax offset from AUD 500 to AUD 810, and the eligibility threshold from AUD 37,000 to AUD 45,000. He added that the initial proposal would have left the threshold unchanged, raising concerns that the tax would ultimately capture a larger number of people in the long run. The Treasurer emphasized that the government aims to ensure equality by applying the tax to defined benefit pensions from July 2026. He believes the net effect of these changes on the budget is a loss of approximately AUD 4.2 billion over the next four years, largely due to the one-year delay in the rollout. Chalmers says changes make the super system fairer The Treasurer on Monday claimed that he and his government always try to take feedback seriously, continually seeking the best way through any crisis. He claimed that the proposed changes will make the superannuation system fairer from top to bottom, adding that his government has just found an alternative to satisfy the same goals. However, Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young pointed out that the proposed changes looked like the government was going weak on taxing the wealthy. She stressed that letting the wealthy off the hook was not the kind of superannuation reforms the Greens want to see. Shadow Treasurer Ted O’Brien also criticized the government’s backdown, calling it an absolute embarrassment. O’Brien also believes it is unfair how Prime Minister Anthony Albanese jetted out, leaving the treasurer to take all the public humiliation. Meanwhile, he still felt that Chalmers should explain the revenue hole in the federal budget despite acknowledging that the government had made the right decision. Treasurer Jim Chalmers confirmed that revamping the superannuation tax system was a joint effort with Prime Minister Albanese, adding that the government was looking to make at least six major changes to the legislation by July 1, 2026. Chalmers said the changes will make the legislation more targeted to ensure a stronger and sustainable pension system, which he also believes will be a better deal for low-income earners. Keating welcomes proposed tax backdown Former Prime Minister Paul Keating welcomed the changes, praising Treasurer Chalmers for successfully working through the impasse and restoring much-needed equity. He claimed that the superannuation accumulations will now be taxed on the basis of realized gains, and at a new, higher limit. Keating said the decision to rework the superannuation system will solidify future related tax arrangements in a way that Australians will rely upon for the long-term security of their retirement savings. However, Chalmers emphasized that these changes are difficult, although they are expected to raise billions of Australian dollars. “This is difficult tax reform … I don’t accept the characterization that this is simple, or easy or uncontested.” – Jim Chalmers , Treasurer of the Australian Government Albanese also weighed in on the matter, saying that it is not unusual for his government to receive feedback suggesting difficult reforms. The prime minister clarified there are no major changes to policy this time, pointing out that his request to the treasury to rework the contentious tax proposal was also nothing out of the ordinary. Chamlers estimates that the change will impact about 80,000 wealthy Australians, which could be adjusted in the future to account for different factors affecting each super tax bracket. He also pointed out that the new thresholds will be tied to inflation, adding that the Treasury is exploring more options to address concerns around the revamped super tax proposal.

The cryptocurrency’s price recently climbed 12.01% over 24 hours to trade near $0.2125 , supported by a daily trading volume of over $5.2 billion. This recovery follows a week of volatility where DOGE fell more than 17%. However, the market structure remains intact, signaling resilience and a continuation of the long-term bullish trend. Uptrend Holds as Prices Form Higher Lows According to analyst JAVON⚡️MARKS, Dogecoin has maintained its pattern of higher lows, confirming the uptrend’s strength. The coin has successfully broken out of a prolonged descending resistance, opening room for an extended rally. Technically, the structure points toward a price target of $0.6533, implying a potential 200% gain from current levels. If buying pressure sustains above the $0.18–$0.20 support region, DOGE could see further expansion toward $1.25 over the coming months. Besides, the consistent higher highs and higher lows show that bulls remain in control. The sustained accumulation phase could provide the momentum required to break upcoming resistance zones and accelerate the rally toward higher Fibonacci targets. Bullish Pennant Shapes on the 4-Hour Chart Trader Tardigrade observed that DOGE is consolidating within a bullish pennant after rallying from $0.1850 to $0.2100. The pattern suggests a continuation setup, with support at $0.2050 and resistance around $0.2120. A breakout above this resistance could spark a move toward $0.2280, aligning with the pennant’s measured target. Market Divergence Signals Institutional Support Source: X Analyst Dom noted that DOGE’s trading behavior during the recent market crash was notably different on Coinbase compared to other exchanges. While prices plunged to $0.09 elsewhere, Coinbase maintained a 40% higher valuation. This divergence indicates that certain market makers may have supported price stability, reflecting potential institutional backing that could reinforce bullish sentiment.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-13 09:46:16

Key Takeaways: Chinese investors defrauded in a $6B Bitcoin Ponzi scheme may face years of legal hurdles to recover their funds. The UK seized 61,000 BTC linked to the case, but proving victims’ ownership remains a major challenge. Lawyers say victims are unlikely to recover Bitcoin’s appreciated value, as courts prioritize returning principal amounts. The long fight comes as lawyers struggle to prove a direct link between their claims and 61,000 bitcoins seized by British authorities, according to a report by Nikkie Asia . Chinese Businesswoman Accused of $6B Crypto Fraud Fled to UK in 2017 The case centers on Qian Zhimin , also known as Zhang Yadi, a 47-year-old Chinese national who fled to the United Kingdom in 2017 after allegedly defrauding investors through her company, Tianjin Lantian Gerui Electronic Technology. From 2014 to 2017, she reportedly raised 43 billion yuan ($6 billion) by selling high-return investment products before converting the funds into crypto assets. Qian pleaded guilty in a London court in late September to two counts of money laundering using cryptocurrencies. Her associate, Wen Jian, was convicted earlier this year and sentenced to nearly seven years in prison for helping move the funds. The London Metropolitan Police later seized 61,000 BTC from Qian’s devices during a 2018 raid in Hampstead, now worth over $7.4 billion, making it the largest crypto seizure in U.K. history. However, the UK government may retain much of the seized Bitcoin, a move that has alarmed victims’ lawyers in China. JUST IN: WORLD'S BIGGEST BITCOIN SEIZURE Chinese woman Zhimin Qian convicted in UK Authorities seized 61,000 BTC worth $6.7 BILLION Funds tied to a massive fraud that scammed 128,000 victims She held more Bitcoin than any corporate entity besides Saylor pic.twitter.com/m4awb6Gh9R — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) September 30, 2025 Jack Ding, assistant managing partner at Duan & Duan, which represents around 10,000 victims, said linking investors’ money to the confiscated coins remains a major obstacle. “Some materials lack sufficient information to establish a clear connection,” he said. Legal experts warn that the complexity of tracing funds across multiple accounts and currencies makes restitution uncertain. A civil recovery case under U.K. law, filed in September 2024, will determine how the assets are distributed. The case is scheduled for January 2026. Yang Yuhua of Thornhill Legal said Qian’s guilty plea “indirectly validates the fraud allegations in China,” but added that recovering the appreciated value of Bitcoin is unlikely. Courts typically focus on returning the principal and reasonable interest rather than speculative gains. 130,000 Chinese Victims Struggle to Claim Bitcoin Losses The victims, estimated at 130,000 across China, include many small investors unfamiliar with digital finance, complicating coordination and documentation. Ding said effective communication has been difficult as many victims “have limited education and experience with computers.” Qian, who previously denied the charges, claimed she fled China to escape a crackdown on crypto entrepreneurs. She is scheduled for sentencing in November, alongside another associate, Hok Seng Ling, who also pleaded guilty. As reported, physical attacks targeting Bitcoin and crypto holders are rising at an alarming rate, according to new data tracked by CASA co-founder Jameson Lopp. Since late February, 35 new violent incidents have been reported globally, a 169% increase in just six and a half months. The uptick adds to an already troubling trend, as cryptocurrency markets continue their bullish run.

Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, First Deputy Ruler of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Finance, and Chairman of the Higher Committee for the Development of the Economic and Financial Sector in the emirate of Dubai, it was announced that Dubai emerged as the world’s single largest licensed market for virtual assets with transaction volumes reaching AED 2.5 trillion equivalent to $680 billion dollars. From the beginning of 2025 till today, virtual asset transaction volumes across regulated entities under VARA surged to nearly AED 2.5 trillion ($680 billion). Meanwhile, virtual assets under management exceeded AED 9.6 billion equivalent to $2.6 billion in 2025. This is driven by the increasing participation of large institutional players. Virtual assets sector makes up 0.5% of Dubai GDP, set to grow to 3% The meeting also revealed that the virtual assets sector contributes an estimated 0.5% to Dubai’s GDP, equivalent to approximately AED 2.2 billion or $500 million. Under the regulated VARA regime, the ecosystem is expected to scale responsibly and reach an estimated 3% GDP, reaching around AED 13 billion or $3.5 billion. HH Sheikh Maktoum Bin Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum in a LinkedIn Post stated, “Dubai currently stands as the world’s single largest licensed virtual assets market, with more than 40 licensed virtual asset service providers and trading volumes reaching AED 2.5 trillion since the beginning of the year.” He commended the pivotal role of Dubai’s VARA in enhancing transparency and solidifying the emirate’s standing as a global hub for virtual assets. The city also hosts 600 registered service providers engaged in advisory, technology, or proprietary trading activities that do not require full regulation. These achievements were highlighted as H.H. Sheikh Maktoum bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum chaired a meeting of the committee. Dubai approves financial sector strategy The meeting also witnessed the approval of the Dubai Financial Sector Strategy, a comprehensive roadmap designed to solidify Dubai’s position as a leading global financial hub, with key goals to double the financial sector’s contribution to the emirate’s GDP and grow the size of assets under management. The strategy plans to launch 15 transformative programs over a three year period with opportunities for investors. It aims to boost market activity by encouraging the listing of more family businesses and startups. Simultaneously, it will foster growth in the asset and wealth management sector by developing legislation and policies that attract new asset managers and family businesses. The strategy also focuses on enhancing the role of small and medium enterprises in the national economy by developing innovative financing models that expand access to capital, ensuring the sustainability of SMEs and increasing their contribution to GDP. The meeting was attended by Mohammad Al Gergawi, Vice Chairman of the Committee; Mohamed bin Hadi Al Hussaini, Omar Sultan Al Olama, Helal Saeed Al Marri, Essa Abdulfattah Kazim, Faisal Yousef bin Sulaitin, Fadel Abdulbaqi Al Ali, His Excellency Saeed AlEter, and Huda Sayed Naim Al Hashimi, Secretary General of the Committee.

For example on Binance, even if there are thousands of liquidation orders in the same second, only one is reported. Because liquidations happen in bursts, this could easily be 100x under-reporting under some conditions,” Yan said. Yan argues that the actual number of liquidations on CEXs far exceeds what is publicly reported, but verifying the truth is difficult because these platforms lack on-chain transparency. He emphasizes that Hyperliquid’s model is fundamentally different: every order, trade, and liquidation occurs on-chain, enabling anyone to audit the system in real time. “On Hyperliquid, every order, trade, and liquidation is transparently verifiable onchain. Many other venues significantly under-report liquidation data.” Yan also reiterated Hyperliquid’s philosophical stance, saying he hopes the industry will begin valuing transparency and neutrality as core features of the future financial system. He framed this not as mere ideology but as a competitive differentiator in an industry increasingly criticized for opaque practices. A Market Crash That Exposed Billions Yan’s remarks coincided with a dramatic market crash on October 10–11, 2025, when over $19 billion in futures positions were liquidated within a 24-hour period. Hyperliquid accounted for $10.3 billion of that total and recorded its largest single liquidation of over $203 million. During the upheaval, Yan pointed out that Hyperliquid’s fully on-chain recording prevents any possibility of data manipulation or concealment. Analysts suggest such radical transparency might become a defining advantage for decentralized platforms over centralized exchanges that struggle with credibility. The crash’s fallout was severe: over 1,000 Hyperliquid users lost all their funds, totaling $1.23 billion in losses. Among them, 205 traders lost more than $1 million, and four major addresses lost between $13 million and $18 million each.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|ZRX|BLOCKCHAIN|BNB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-13 09:53:59

Ripple (XRP), once a darling of cross-border payments speculation, is starting to feel the weight of inherent limitations. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting attention as a DeFi protocol structured around usage and demand mechanics. For many, it represents a cleaner, more scalable alternative in the current cycle. Ripple (XRP) In early 2021, XRP grabbed headlines with a dramatic rally, investors betting on regulatory outcomes and institutional adoption saw rapid gains. But that environment is gone. Today, XRP battles structural constraints: its large market cap means future percentage growth is harder, and much of the upside is already reflected in price. Regulatory baggage looms large. Ripple’s multi-year legal standoff with the U.S. SEC has kept XRP under scrutiny, making institutional entrants cautious. There’s also supply pressure: Ripple controls a massive reserve of XRP, which it releases periodically, raising the risk of dilution over time. Technical charts now hint at downside risk, analysts warn that a break below key support zones could trigger corrections. Because of these pressures, many investors feel XRP no longer offers the asymmetric upside it once did and are shifting toward a new DeFi token that embed demand into its design, rather than relying on speculative sentiment. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is a decentralized lending and borrowing protocol built on Ethereum, designed to tie token value directly to platform activity. Its dual-lending markets structure gives it flexibility and risk segregation: Peer-to-Contract (P2C): This is for mainstream assets like ETH and stablecoins (e.g. USDT). Users deposit these into pooled liquidity, earn interest, and the pool supports variable-rate borrowing against collateral. This model prioritizes efficiency and deep liquidity, making it ideal for users seeking stable yields and predictable borrowing conditions. Peer-to-Peer (P2P): This handles less liquid or riskier tokens, enabling isolated agreements between individuals without dragging down the main pools. Tokens such as DOGE, PEPE, or niche altcoins can be used here, giving users flexibility to negotiate custom rates and terms while keeping volatility risks contained within individual agreements. Borrowers must overcollateralize: deposit more value than what they borrow. For instance, if you deposit ETH worth $10,000, you might borrow up to 7,500 USDT (assuming a 75% LTV for stable assets). This structure protects the protocol by ensuring there’s a buffer in case collateral value drops. You benefit by unlocking liquidity without selling your underlying asset. The protocol offers variable interest rates, which fluctuate based on utilization, and stable rates that lock in a repayment cost (but may rebalance if conditions shift too far. This gives borrowers predictability when needed. When users deposit into lending pools, the protocol issues mtTokens (e.g. mtETH or mtUSDT) at a 1:1 ratio. These tokens accrue value over time as interest accumulates. For example, if you deposit 10,000 USDT, you get 10,000 mtUSDT; over the year, that position might grow by the APY rate (for example, 10% or more), and you can redeem your base + yield. The result is a transparent, compounding yield mechanism that rewards long-term liquidity providers. Clear Development Timeline The team recently confirmed via an X statement that V1 of Mutuum Finance’s lending and borrowing protocol is scheduled to launch on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025, marking a key step toward bringing the platform’s mechanics to life. This initial rollout will include essential modules such as liquidity pools, debt tokens, liquidator bots, and support for ETH and USDT as the first assets for lending, borrowing, and collateral. This alignment between product development and token listing provides a rare degree of clarity for investors, minimizing reliance on speculation and signaling that utility will follow closely behind the presale, something many early-stage projects fail to deliver. On the fundraising side, the MUTM token is currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, up from $0.01 in Phase 1, marking a 250% increase for early buyers. The structured model has already attracted over $17 million in funding and brought in more than 16,800 holders, underscoring the growing market interest and community engagement as the project moves toward its next price increase to $0.04 and eventual $0.06 listing. XRP vs MUTM XRP’s drawbacks are stacking up, high market cap, regulatory overhang, supply control by Ripple, and growing vulnerability to whale exits have all raised caution flags. Meanwhile, MUTM is still at an early base, giving it room for explosive percentage growth. Consider a $750 investment in MUTM at $0.035: If the token reaches $0.25 post-launch, that position becomes $5,357, roughly a 7x token appreciation. Analysts view this target as realistic because MUTM’s growth is backed by real utility rather than speculation. With the beta platform launching around listing, users will be able to lend, borrow, and stake from day one, while the buy-and-distribute model channels platform revenue into continuous token buybacks. Combined with clear development timelines, a fixed presale model, and probabilities for top-tier exchange listings, these factors give the $0.25 target solid footing as adoption accelerates. The contrast is stark: XRP’s upside is now constrained by scale and external factors, while MUTM’s design and early valuation still leave room for meaningful appreciation. Why MUTM’s Early Entry Matters Put simply: Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built to embed demand through actual usage. Its dual lending markets, overcollateralized borrowing, variable and stable rates, and yield-accruing mtTokens make it a protocol with real economic levers. MUTM is positioned to outpace XRP not by competing head-on—but by occupying a fundamentally different role. XRP is now more mature, constrained, and vulnerable to regulatory and supply drag. MUTM, by contrast, is early-stage, utility-driven, and structured to reward participation. And that’s exactly why many investors are shifting capital. Early entry into a protocol with this kind of foundation can capture upside that XRP simply can’t offer at this stage.

The token barely budged at first — slipping roughly 2-3% during the early shock — and later traded above $1,130, gaining over 10% in 24 hours as buyers returned. Related Reading: A 5% Bitcoin Drop In October? History Shows That’s Rare CZ Pushes Back At Doubters Changpeng Zhao, the former Binance chief, answered critics on social media who suggested BNB’s steady price action deserved closer scrutiny. He mocked those raising alarm, using a laugh emoji and urging people to share more examples of BNB’s strength. He also said he was unaware of any affiliated entities buying or selling BNB in recent days and highlighted the community and infrastructure behind the chain as reasons for confidence. According to CoinMarketCap data, BNB’s limited drop put it in the same group as Bitcoin among the top-five coins that recorded minimal daily losses during the liquidation event. That put BNB in a small set of assets that outperformed peers while the market bled. fudders even try to make this sound like a bad thing? 😂🤷‍♂️ Please post more of this about #BNB. 🙏 https://t.co/hOUy6ll4BS — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) October 12, 2025 Community And Utility Provide Support Reports have disclosed several practical reasons why BNB held up. The token offers trading fee discounts, which become more valuable when volatility spikes and trading volume rises. Network revenue also climbed with the surge in activity, giving the token real transactional demand beyond speculation. BNB’s deflationary token design was mentioned as another factor that can support price under stress. Interesting how BNB was barely affected at all. pic.twitter.com/xurnb5vr1a — Jason Appleton (Crypto Crow) (@jasonappleton) October 12, 2025 Some observers have pointed out an additional feature: a lack of market maker involvement. CZ reiterated that claim, saying the project does not rely on affiliated trading entities to prop up price, and that the chain’s community and core functions help absorb shocks. Analyst Views And Market Moves Prominent trader Altcoin Sherpa described the token as “insanely strong,” noting that its outperformance was surprising even during a broad market rebound. Market participants took notice when BNB’s intraday loss turned out to be deeper than its modest seven-day decline, suggesting buying interest reappeared at key levels after the worst of the sell-off passed. $BNB is insanely strong, this surprised me a bit seeing the move today. All majors are bouncing a bit but BNB outperformance still confirms that BSC/BNB ecosystem is the place to play for now. pic.twitter.com/cYDbjJerKo — Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) October 12, 2025 Some figures in the crypto space reported that certain meme-focused tokens plunged as much as 80% during the same period. By contrast, BNB’s deeper dip at one point reached about 17% before it recovered — a pattern that left traders debating whether the move was driven by genuine demand or by the particular structure of the Binance ecosystem.

Rather than focusing on general market sentiment, he provided specific chart-based insights, highlighting both short-term risk and the possibility of a strong rebound if historical patterns remain consistent. His observations are centered on liquidation clusters and recurring structural trends visible across multiple XRP market cycles. IF YOU HOLD #XRP I GOT NEWS FOR YOU!!!!!!!!!!! (urgent) pic.twitter.com/wa2vzP8Oed — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 11, 2025 Short-Term Caution: Liquidation Risks Near $2.25 Steph emphasized that XRP’s current liquidation heatmap reveals a notable concentration of liquidity around the $2.25 level. According to his assessment, this cluster likely represents stop-loss orders and liquidation levels from long positions. He warned that traders using high leverage could be vulnerable to a sharp wick designed to clear out these positions. This type of move, he suggested, could occur before any major upward move, serving as a reminder that sudden downside volatility often precedes broader trend reversals in volatile markets, such as XRP . Examining Historical Price Structure Across Multiple Cycles Transitioning from immediate risks to long-term structure, Steph analyzed XRP’s three-day timeframe, focusing on earlier cycles spanning 2014, 2020, and 2024. He used the 50-day simple moving average to compare price behavior across these years, identifying recurring characteristics in XRP’s macro performance. In each observed cycle, a similar sequence emerged: a significant pullback around April, followed by a higher low around July, and a breakout above the 50-day moving average. After that, the asset tended to enter a prolonged corrective phase before delivering a strong rally later in the year. Steph noted that this pattern was evident in 2020, when XRP surged strongly in November, and again in 2014, when a similar rally took place during the same period. He argued that the consistent timing of these movements indicates that XRP may be preparing for another decisive move, potentially starting as early as October but more likely by November. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Bullish Outlook Despite Short-Term Uncertainty Despite highlighting the risk of forced liquidations, Steph maintained a bullish stance on XRP’s overall trajectory. His message suggested that current downward pressure does not contradict a broader bullish setup. Instead, he views it as part of a familiar structure that has historically led to significant gains. By aligning current activity with past market behavior, he implied that temporary declines may be strategic rather than fundamentally driven. He reiterated that while corrective movements can create uncertainty, they often precede substantial upward shifts, particularly once price reclaims key moving averages and liquidity is reset. For long-term holders, his analysis presents an optimistic view rooted in cyclical trends rather than short-term price fluctuations.

HOW TO BUY $HYPER Today’s Bitcoin Technical Analysis Despite Friday’s dump, Bitcoin’s outlook remains extremely bullish, with the token now looking primed to rally higher and reclaim its previous all-time highs, potentially even pushing into new uncharted territories. Though Friday’s action saw the token reach around $103K, the price quickly snapped back and closed above the $105K-$110K support zone, proving once again that this zone – the same one that kicked off Bitcoin’s rally to new all-time highs in late September – remains strong. Furthermore, another confluence is that the area from which Bitcoin bounced also coincides with the 200 EMA, further confirming the rebound. Although BTC is trading sideways so far today, that’s actually a good sign following the sharp rally of the past couple of days. It tells us that Bitcoin is simply taking a breather before potentially continuing its long-term uptrend. Tether and Circle Pump $1.75B Into the Market — Is Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) the Next to Soar? October 13, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Following Trump’s 100% tariff announcement last Friday, the market crashed wiping out almost $20B in leveraged positions. In response, Tether and Circle injected over $1.75B in new stablecoins into circulation. Tether minted $1B on Ethereum on oct 11 – One of the largest issuance bursts thus year. Alternatively, Circle minted $750M on Solana , boosting total holdings on the network to $12.8B, and total USDC supply to roughly $75B. Analysts view this increase in stablecoin minting as a sign of investors reallocating funds instead of exiting the market. Interestingly, it also reflects their intention to buy the dip on major assets like $BTC and $ETH. As the surge in USDT and USDC signals renewed confidence and liquidity returning after Friday’s sell-off, presale opportunities now stand out as a stability anchor amid market turbulence. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a layer 2 scalability solution created to enable faster and cheaper $BTC transactions has already raised $23.3M in presale.

From Bitcoin & ETH Rebound to the Rise of Maxi Doge — The Next Crypto to Explode October 13, 2025 • 10:00 UTC After Trump made headline on Friday, October 10th after imposing 100% tariff on China, the market tumbled sharply causing $BTC to go as low as $103,111. This comes as a shock because the complementary value of gold just touched its ATH last week ($126K) . However, the President has calmed down over the weekend, posting on his Truth Social page that relations with China are fine and that the US only wants to support it, not confront it. Thanks to Trump’s redemption post on Sunday , the market bounced back with renewed energy. $BTC and $ETH are surging 12% and 20%, leading a wider recovery across the crypto landscape. As traders eagerly anticipate the market to recover, presale opportunities offer a safe haven as they don’t experience price dips like crypto assets until TGE. That said, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is proving itself a serious contender — already having crossed the $3.5M funding mark in its presale. Learn how to buy Maxi Doge in our detailed guide here. Tether and Circle Mint $1.75B in Stablecoins Amid Market Crash, Fueling Maxi Doge October 13, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Tether and Circle have minted over $1.75B in stablecoins shortly after Trump announced its 100% tariffs on China. Tether bore most of the pool with $1B in fresh USDT minte d on Ethereum, with Circle managing the rest of the $750M in Solana-based USDC. This new minting session brought Tether’s total supply to $180B, with $80B in Ethereum alone, while Circle increased its own supply to $75B. The move signals strong confidence in the market’s direction, which fuels projects like Best Wallet Token ($BEST) . As one of the best non-custodial, user-friendly crypto wallets on the market, Best Wallet offers holders reduced transaction fees, early access to new projects, and higher staking rewards.

The launch happened despite the wave of automatic deleveraging on Hyperliquid. Hyperliquid will go on with the launch of the HIP-3 upgrade, despite the weekend’s wave of liquidations. The new feature will go live on mainnet, allowing developers to deploy their own perp DEX markets with a different set of conditions. HIP-3 will allow developer teams to launch their own perp DEX on HyperEVM, against a collateral of 500K HYPE. The new feature will be released during the usual scheduled network upgrade, which is expected to take 10 minutes. Until recently, the HIP-3 feature was in an advanced testnet stage, and has now reached the milestone of permissionless perp DEX. Deployers will also be able to set their own fee level, with a base fee share of up to 50%. They will also be able to pick their data and oracle service, and will be fully responsible for trading. HIP-3 will require 500K HYPE deposits To ensure quality markets, the 500K HYPE share will be slashable in case of unauthorized behaviors or unfair trading. The launch of third-party markets arrived just after one of the biggest stress tests for perp DEX trading, which led to auto deleveraging with no way to preserve positions. The weekend’s liquidation event put a question on the ability of both centralized and decentralized exchanges to react to erratic price movements. The upcoming addition of builder-generated perp DEX will further increase the competition between markets. The growth of perp DEX activity was also behind the recent wave of liquidations, as it turns out a larger number of retail crypto traders were using leverage. As Cryptopolitan reported , Hyperliquid was one of the top venues for liquidations, as traders had the biggest position wipeout in crypto history. HYPE recovers after weekend crash Total open interest on Hyperliquid remained near an all-time peak at over $15B, despite the recent liquidations. As the market attempted a sharp recovery, Hyperliquid is one of the key venues for rebuilding liquidity. Hyperliquid open interest remained above $15B despite the wave of automated deleveraging. | Source: Hyperliquid Stats . BTC open interest was also near its peak at over $4.27B. As a result, the native HYPE token also recovered. HYPE traded at $42.13, up over 13% in the past 24 hours. The increased demand for HYPE stakes for HIP-3 may lock even more coins from the market. Additionally, the market crisis set expectation for further airdrops or other tools to retain traders and preserve activity. HYPE also gets a boost from regular buybacks, with $3.28M put back into the market for the past day. During the market slump, buybacks happened at the $38 range. In the past month, buybacks reached over $106.5M , keeping HYPE within a relatively strong range. HYPE open interest is also starting to recover, jumping to $1.33B as the market showed signs that the weekend liquidation cascade may not have a lasting effect on the market.

The crypto market nosedived immediately after the announcement, with Bitcoin (BTC) briefly crashing to as low as $101,000 on some exchanges. In the following days, though, the bulls reclaimed much of the losses, and now the big question is whether the asset is ready to soar to a new all-time high during this cycle. More Room for Growth? As of this writing, BTC trades well above $115,000, representing a 3.5% increase on a daily scale and a substantial resurgence from the local low. Many analysts believe the worst is over, while some, like Alex Becker, think this could have been the actual “start of the bull market.” He argued that the market has been quite “boring” lately and that the crash put a “zesty sauce” that could bring some necessary dynamics to the sector. Becker claimed that the collapse was nothing more than an “overreaction” to Trump’s announcement, describing it as “the most manipulative dump in the history of crypto.” According to him, BTC may reach a new historical peak as early as this week, suggesting that “selling right now could be the stupidest thing you could ever do.” The veteran trader Peter Brandt also chipped in. He assumed that BTC, as well as some leading altcoins like ETH, XRP, and XLM, remain in a good position to attack fresh tops. For his part, X user Ted told his 213,000 followers that the primary cryptocurrency could reach a new ATH if it reclaims the crucial resistance level of around $117,500. Exploring Some Indicators Multiple important metrics, such as BTC’s exchange reserve, support the bullish theory. CryptoQuant’s data indicates that the amount of BTC stored on crypto platforms recently dropped to a seven-year low of approximately 2.43 million assets. BTC Exchange Reserve, Source: CryptoQuant Next on the list is the popular Fear & Greed Index, which measures the overall market sentiment across investors. On October 12, it plunged to 24, the lowest point since April this year, while currently it is set at 38, which is again “Fear” territory. BTC Fear & Greed, Source: alternative.me This development signals that many market participants show signs of panic and pessimism. However, the crypto market is an unusual one, and it often moves against the crowd’s expectations. This is why Warren Buffett’s timeless principle – to be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy – has become increasingly relevant in the volatile sector.

The move sparked the sharpest fall in the last ten years for Bitcoin as $BTC fell more than $15,000 in just a few hours. That said, has the situation now been resolved, and is the crash already over? Carnage and mayhem already changing to optimism Last Friday, which was particularly deserving of being called “black Friday”, at least in crypto circles, more than $19 billion was liquidated in the space of just a few hours. This wasn’t just the worst wipeout in crypto history, it was the worst by a magnitude of about ten times any previous liquidation events. Even traders who had already watched the first spectacular fall and who had then entered positions in anticipation of a bounce, were then wiped out in their turn as the price just kept on falling. After such mayhem and carnage, here we are on Monday, and the Bitcoin price is in full recovery mode. After falling to just below $105,000, the $BTC price is now trading at around $115,400 - a $10,000 revival, with potentially a full recovery taking place by the end of this week. President Trump has walked back on his threats by posting on his Truth Social account on Sunday that “it will all be fine!”. The U.S. stock market appears to believe this assurance as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures markets are now climbing. Bitcoin tanks but recovery now in full swing Source: TradingView The short-term time frame for the $BTC price certainly tells a story. It can be seen that the dip started at $122,600, while up until then it had appeared that it was only a matter of time before $BTC made a new all-time high. However, President Trump had other ideas, and a tirade released on his Truth Social account accused China of holding the world “captive” by monopolising its rare earths. The U.S. stock market started to fall heavily, although given that Trump’s tirade was released late on Friday, the markets were perhaps fortunate to have been saved from further capitulation by the weekly close of trading. If the stock market falls heavily, the crypto market is going to absolutely tank, and this is exactly what occurred on Friday and going into Saturday. However, the long red candle down to nearly $105,000 was bought up fairly quickly, as evidenced by the long wick that was left behind. Now here we are on Monday with a full-blown recovery in mid-flow. The $113,000 horizontal level was rapidly regained, and now the bulls are fighting to sustain the price above the $115,000 resistance. With the U.S. stock market opening later, probably in buoyant mood, after conciliatory noises from both Trump and Chinese sources, the $BTC price could continue to regain lost ground. Upside price momentum incoming Source: TradingView The daily time frame shows how the ongoing recovery is now at the point where practically all the damage has already been undone by the $BTC price . The spectacular fall even tagged the 200-day SMA (red line), which is generally recognised as the bull market support, and has continued up to recently regain the 50-day SMA (blue line). At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators on this time frame were the last to get down into oversold territory and reset, and the huge price dip certainly speeded up this process. With the blue fast line now posturing to cross up above the red slow line, this could be a signal that upside price momentum could shortly be on the way. $BTC price in ascending wedge Source: TradingView A very simple chart view of the weekly illustrates that an ascending trendline held the price, and it appears that this could form the bottom of an ascending wedge. As this trendline climbs at a faster pace than the 8-year ascending trendline above, it will force the price into a narrowing convergence of the two lines and what could be a big price explosion to either side. At the bottom of the chart, it can be seen that the big dip forced the blue indicator line below the red one. This will potentially reverse back to the upside if the $BTC price continues to increase into the rest of this week. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Marszalek suggested that regulators should look into whether certain exchanges intentionally slowed down trading systems during the crash, making it impossible for users to react or close their positions. He also emphasized the need to verify the accuracy of trade executions and ensure that they correctly reflect market index prices. Focus on Transparency and Consumer Protection The Crypto.com chief called on regulators to examine the trading surveillance systems and anti–money laundering (AML) frameworks used by major platforms. He also questioned whether internal trading desks are truly separated from external market operations, which could otherwise raise serious conflict-of-interest concerns. “It’s time to ensure that exchanges operate with full transparency and integrity,” Marszalek said. “Regulators must step in to protect users and restore confidence in the market.” Marszalek noted that the historic $19 billion in liquidations had severely affected thousands of traders, adding that the primary responsibility of regulators is to safeguard consumers and preserve market fairness. The October 2025 crash became the largest wave of liquidations in crypto history, erasing billions in leveraged positions within hours. Binance Responds With Compensation Program Following the crash, Binance announced that it had launched a compensation program related to three affected tokens. The company later confirmed that it had already distributed $283 million to users impacted by the event.

Jeff Yan, founder of Hyperliquid, claimed that Binance and other centralized exchanges (CEXs) have been concealing the extent of user liquidations during last Friday’s market bloodbath. In a post on X Monday, Yan said the crash, which erased more than $20 billion from global crypto markets per Cryptopolitan’s report , exposed “how centralized platforms hide data.” “Anyone on Hyperliquid can permissionlessly verify the chain’s execution, including all liquidations and their fair execution for all users, and anyone can verify the solvency of the entire system in real time,” Yan wrote . He continued to say Hyperliquid’s system records every order, trade, and liquidation onchain, so all of its data is supposedly “publicly verifiable.” Binance only reports some liquidations, Yan insists According to Yan, Binance only reports one liquidation per symbol every 1,000 milliseconds, even if thousands occur within that same period. “Because liquidations happen in bursts, this could easily be 100x under-reporting under some conditions,” he posted. Hyperliquid’s fully onchain liquidations cannot be compared with underreported CEX liquidations Hyperliquid is a blockchain where every order, trade, and liquidation happens onchain. Anyone can permissionlessly verify the chain’s execution, including all liquidations and their… pic.twitter.com/K5sv74LJgO — jeff.hl (@chameleon_jeff) October 13, 2025 The Hyperliquid founder shared a screenshot from Binance’s developer forum stating: “For each symbol, only the latest one liquidation order within 1000ms will be pushed as the snapshot. If no liquidation happens in the interval of 1000ms, no stream will be pushed.” The back and forth between the exchanges came days after a decline across global crypto markets on Friday. The downturn was triggered by US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a 100% tariff on Chinese goods containing any “crucial software” beginning on November 1. During the selloff, Hyperliquid’s onchain liquidation data was reportedly visible in real time, and some crypto investors are now comparing its transparency to that of centralized exchanges like Binance, OKX, and Bybit. “Long story short, Hyperliquid and Ethena did nothing wrong. Binance did many things wrong,” one X account commented, defending Yan’s claims. CZ defends Binance, clarifies links to Hyperliquid Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) appeared to respond to Yan’s chatter, albeit without naming Hyperliquid directly. He reposted a message from a BNB community influencer that lauded Binance for compensating affected traders following the October 10 market slump. The post claimed the exchange paid out more than $283 million to users within 24 hours of the incident. “Some people ask why is BNB so strong? While others tried to ignore, hide, shift blame, or attack competitors, the key BNBChain ecosystem players (Binance, Venus, and more) took hundreds of millions out of their own pockets to PROTECT USERS. Different value systems,” CZ wrote on X. When the accusations were being thrown around last Friday, including one that Binance incubated Hyperliquid, Zhao revealed it was Hyperliquid’s founder who had a brief history with Binance Labs’ early incubation program.

YZiLabs did not recoup any of its investment. It happens.” The former CEO reiterated he personally had little contact with Yan at the time, saying: “I did not interact with Jeff much back then. I forgot about it. I only learned this from Ella early this year. I was supposed to have a call with Jeff a few months back, but I missed it due to a schedule error on my part…YZI Labs, to the best of my knowledge, was not given and does not own any investments (equity or token) in HL.” Hyperliquid questioned over centralization Yan’s criticism of Binance sparked pushback on one of its biggest pain points: validators and governance. Naysayers claim that the DEX’s validators do not truly validate transactions and instead “blind sign” blocks without verifying their contents. “The validators just blind sign the prebuilt blocks without knowing what’s in it,” one community member noted on X. “They are more like attesters than validators.” Others pointed to the platform’s closed-source code and validator selection process. “Seven of eleven ‘independent’ validators were hand-picked by HL. Add that to the validators HL is running directly and they control eleven of sixteen,” a DeFi onchain asset allocator Spark contributor explained , also claiming Hyperliquid “directly controls about 81% of the total stake,” leaving the system reliant on a centralized API for uptime.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.54 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $5.75. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs). Overview Cryptocurrency Dogwifhat Ticker WIF Current price $0.5599 Market cap $556.61M Trading volume $450.24M Circulating supply 998.92M WIF All-time high $4.85 on (March 31, 2024) All-time low $0.000023 (November 2023) 24-hour high $0.5706 24-hour low $0.4778 Dogwifhat price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 14.23% 50-day SMA $0.8125 14-Day RSI 33.02 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 38 (Fear) Green days 15/30 (50%) 200-Day SMA $0.7950 Dogwifhat (WIF) price analysis TL;DR Breakdown Dogwifhat (WIF) is stabilizing around $0.55 after a heavy drop, with early signs of recovery. Bears still dominate, but short-term indicators show mild bullish momentum. WIF’s key support sits at $0.50, with resistance at $0.61. Dogwifhat price analysis 1-day chart On the 1-day chart for October 13, Dogwifhat (WIF) is attempting a mild rebound after a steep sell-off that dragged the price from around $0.75 to the $0.45 zone. Currently trading near $0.55, the coin is consolidating after the heavy red candle breakdown, but the recovery appears fragile. The Alligator indicator lines are diverging downward, indicating that the bearish trend is still dominant. The MACD remains in negative territory, with the histogram showing faintly lighter red bars, which suggests bearish momentum is easing but far from a confirmed bullish crossover. WIFUSDT 1-day chart by Tradingview The volume spike on October 9 confirmed a panic sell-off, while the current lower yet steady volume hints at cautious re-entry attempts. Immediate resistance lies at $0.61 (the green Alligator baseline), with further resistance levels around $0.66 and $0.71. If WIF fails to reclaim $0.61 soon, another pullback toward $0.50 or even the $0.45 wick low remains likely. Dogwifhat price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour chart, Dogwifhat (WIF) bottomed at $0.45, and bounced sharply toward $0.58 but failed to close above it. The price is now consolidating between $0.536 and $0.58, a critical range that could dictate the next move. WIFUSDT 4-hour chart by Tradingview If WIF breaks above $0.58, it could push toward $0.69. However, a rejection there could lead to a retest of $0.52–$0.53. The MACD has flipped positive, indicating a return of short-term bullish pressure.

WIF is in a fragile recovery phase. Trading above $0.53 could allow it to retest $0.61 and $0.69. Failure to hold that support may result in a slide back toward $0.45 before any sustainable rebound. Is Dogwifhat crypto a good investment? Dogwifhat (WIF) is a highly speculative meme coin fueled by online culture and community enthusiasm rather than fundamental utility or innovation. While it may present short-term opportunities for high-risk traders during bullish market sentiment, its long-term investment value remains questionable. With no clear roadmap, technical use case, or underlying utility, WIF’s price is largely driven by social media trends and investor speculation. For cautious or long-term investors, it poses significant risk and should only be considered in minimal portfolio allocations. Ultimately, dogwifhat is better suited for speculative play than strategic, utility-based crypto investing grounded in strong fundamentals. Where to buy WIF? Currently, traders and investors can buy Dogwifhat (WIF) on these CEXs: Binance, Binance.US, Raydium, Coinbase Exchange, Gate.io, KuCoin, Kraken, Crypto.com Exchange, MEXC, HTX, Bybit, Bitget, LBank, and several other s . Will WIF reach $10? Having reached a peak price of $4.85 in 2024, the $10 target might not be too far-fetched. Can Dogwifhat reach $100? Dogwifhat (WIF) reaching $100 is highly ambitious and could be unlikely. Its market must be at least $99.9 billion – a value that exceeds the highest market cap ever for a meme (Dogecoin) at $88.79 billion. DOGE’s marketcap history | GlobalData Does WIF have a good long-term future? WIF has the potential for a good long-term future if it continues to gain popularity and adoption. Analysts project a market price of about $1.5-$2 by the end of 2025 and about $3.4 to $4.2 by 2031. However, as with all meme coins, WIF’s future is uncertain and highly dependent on market trends and community support.

A breathtaking plunge liquidated around 1.6 million traders to the tune of more than $19 billion in losses - making this the worst crash in crypto history. Monday arrives and the market is in full recovery mode. What’s next? Worst crash in crypto history Friday’s crypto crash will go into the annals of history as the worst ever. When President Trump released a tirade later that day, berating China over its monopolisation of rare earths, nothing could have prepared anyone for what then ensued. The full implications of Trump’s threat to impose a further 100% tariffs on China began to sink in, and a landslide started to take place across the U.S. stock markets. The S&P lost 2.7%, and the Nasdaq 3.5% - huge movements for the stock market. Such large tremors in the stock market were nothing to the full-on volcanic-like fury of the tiny crypto market. Total2, the combined market cap of all crypto, excluding Bitcoin, plunged nearly half a trillion dollars, falling from $1.66 trillion, down to $1.18 trillion in a matter of hours. Some of the smaller market cap cryptos nosedived, losing as much as 95% of their worth, while the big market cap coins like Ethereum and Solana lost 20%. Ripple (XRP) crashed a seemingly impossible 43.5%. Total2 falls almost half a trillion dollars Source: TradingView The daily chart for Total2 shows the crazy descent in price that almost touched the deepest of the Fibonacci levels, sitting at $1.17 trillion. However, the buyback started almost straight away, and the price rose rapidly, regaining itself around $1.44 trillion before putting on another spurt on Sunday. The Stochastic RSI indicators have turned back around and are signaling upside price momentum. By the time they reach the top again, it may be likely that the Total2 market cap could be at an all-time high again. $ETH loses major $4,000 horizontal support then regains it Source: TradingView At one point the $ETH price fell through the major $4,000 support and even went below $3,600. Nevertheless, as can be seen in the daily chart above, a trendline held the price and a bounce took place from there. The major $4,000 support has been regained and it now remains for a possible confirmation of this to take place, which would bring the price back to the $4,000 mark before climbing higher. $SUI not far from going to zero Source: TradingView One of the hardest-hit of the major layer 1 altcoins was $SUI. Almost in danger of going to zero, the $SUI price plunged 83% on Friday. The size of the candle wick that was left behind bears testament to the hair-raising slide for $SUI. Be that as it may, the price is now knocking on the door of the $2.81 resistance level. If the bulls can flip this into support again the bull market would be very much back on for $SUI. Retaking the $3.21 resistance level would be the next step. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

He instead favors AI-generated responses for investor Q&A when raising capital for Perplexity. Pitch decks are commonly used in funding rounds to provide investors with key details about a company’s founders, product offerings, and financial outlook. Srinivas said during an interview with Berkeley Haas that he has replaced traditional investor pitch decks with AI-assisted communication, which represents a shift from typical Silicon Valley fundraising norms. Srinivas says the Series A funding was the only time he made a pitch deck Aravind Srinivas co-founded Perplexity, an AI-powered search engine, after working as a researcher at Google’s DeepMind and OpenAI . He confirmed during an interview that he no longer prepares slide presentations when raising capital. “Famously, the Series A was the only time I made a pitch deck. I just write a memo and I tell them you can do a Q&A and ask whatever you want. And if you need anything else that is not internal data, you can ask Perplexity. Like, it already knows everything.” – Aravind Srinivas , Perplexity co-founder Srinivas revealed that the Series A funding round was the only time he made a pitch deck. Still, for the latest funding round, he relied heavily on the company’s AI engine to interact with potential investors. He described a situation in which he held a Zoom webinar with an investor who later contributed a substantial amount of capital. He confirmed that he had replied to a lengthy follow-up email from the investor with inquiries, using responses from Perplexity . He simply copied the answers to several questions in real-time. Perplexity started its Series A funding round in March 2023, which attracted $25.6 million led by Peter Sonsini of New Enterprise Associates with participation from the seed round investors Elad Gil, Founder of Color Health, Nat Friedman, Former CEO of GitHub and Bob Muglia Former President of Microsoft, as well as new investors Susan Wojcicki Former CEO of Youtube, Paul Buchheit Creator of Gmail, Soleio Designer of Messenger, Dropbox, and Databricks Ventures. Perplexity intensifies competition across the AI landscape Business Insider reported last month that the AI search engine firm Perplexity was seeking additional capital at a $20 billion valuation. The raise would mark a $2 billion increase in valuation from the previous $18 billion valuation in July. The firm has also received funding from Nvidia, SoftBank, and Jeff Bezos. The report revealed that the firm has accumulated approximately $1.5 billion to date, with approximately $150 million in annual recurring revenue. Perplexity has also launched its own native browser, Comet , which competes with tech giants like Google and OpenAI. The browser aims to shift internet use from passive browsing to active thinking by integrating conversational AI directly into web navigation. The tool allows users to ask questions, compare content, automate tasks, and maintain context across sites. Other companies, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google, have expanded AI-driven research and communication tools. According to a Cryptopolitan report, OpenAI has signed over $1 trillion in compute deals this year alone, despite generating only $12 billion in annual revenue. The report highlighted deals signed between OpenAI and Nvidia, AMD, Oracle, and CoreWeave, which open the door to more than 20 gigawatts of computing power. Nvidia’s deal with the ChatGPT developer could grow to $500 billion, while AMD’s deal is projected to grow to $300 billion. Oracle and CoreWeave may add another $322 billion in commitments.

53082593,https://coinpaper.com/11547/dogecoin-rebounds-17-as-trade-war-fears-ease-and-investor-confidence-returns,1760356734,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Dogecoin Rebounds 17% as Trade War Fears Ease and Investor Confidence Returns,https://coinpaper.com/11547/dogecoin-rebounds-17-as-trade-war-fears-ease-and-investor-confidence-returns,"Dogecoin experienced a 17% increase on Monday, reaching an intraday high of $0.21, recovering from a sharp decline that pushed the meme coin to a three-month low. The token had lost 33% of its value in the last week and hit a bottom at $0.18 on October 12. Despite Monday's gains, Dogecoin remains 54% below its all-time high of $0.46, reached in December. The rebound was part of a wider recovery in the cryptocurrency market, triggered by President Donald Trump's remarks. Trump posted on Truth Social that the United States government was negotiating with China on proposed 100% tariffs on imported rare earth metals. The tariffs, scheduled to begin on November 1, had rattled global markets and raised concerns about escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. Crypto Market Shows Strength Across Major Assets The clarification by Trump, which alleviated any anticipation of a complete trade war, led to a fresh surge in the purchasing of digital assets. Bitcoin rose once again above $115,000, and Ethereum and BNB recorded increases of 9% and 16%, respectively. The rally extended into the meme coin industry, with the total cryptocurrency market capitalization again surpassing the $4 trillion threshold. Traders reported that Dogecoin not only has a better sentiment in the market, but it also has high conviction amongst its holders. CoinGlass data indicated a significant transfer of tokens from exchanges. Dogecoin has experienced 10 consecutive days of net outflows since the start of October, totaling more than $440 million. Dogecoin outflow: Coinglass Outflows of exchange are usually a sign that investors are moving their investments to self-custody wallets. This activity is an indication of confidence in the long-term outlook of the asset, which in turn decreases the pressure to sell in the short term. The supply of tokens on exchanges is reduced when the tokens are withdrawn, and this may contribute to the price increasing if demand remains constant. Technical Indicators Point to Further Upside Potential The technical analysis of the Dogecoin 4-hour chart indicates that it has formed a bullish pennant pattern. This structure is formed when an asset experiences a steep rise in price, followed by consolidation. Breakouts from such patterns often lead to continuation of the upward trend. Dogecoin on 4-hour chart Dogecoin was also testing the upper limit of the pennant formation at the level of $0.21. The momentum indicators suggest that the token has a promising future ahead. The MACD line has now crossed above the signal line, indicating that momentum is shifting towards buyers. The RSI indicator shows that it lies close to the neutral territory, and it has the opportunity to gain further, potentially increasing to an overbought level. Dogecoin RSI chart Analysts suggest that Dogecoin may target $0.25 in the next price increase, representing a 19% rise from its current value. This objective aligns with the 200-day simple moving average, one of the primary technical indicators closely monitored by traders. But any slip below the bullish-supportive level of $0.20 would invalidate the bullish formation and reverse the bearish formation.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|DOGE|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-13 11:58:54

WULF's strategic shift to AI infrastructure, highlighted by a major Fluidstack/Google deal, diversifies revenue and reduces Bitcoin volatility risk. Strong Bitcoin seasonality, pro-crypto U.S. policies, and rising institutional adoption create a favorable environment for WULF's continued growth. Despite a premium valuation, WULF's rapid revenue growth, scalable AI operations, and potential interest rate tailwinds justify its bullish outlook. TeraWulf, Inc. ( WULF ) is a digital asset company specializing in Bitcoin mining and AI infrastructure operations. WULF utilizes sustainable energy sources, such as nuclear, solar power, and hydro energy, to facilitate its operations, mine Bitcoin, and provide AI cloud and data center hosting services to third parties. The stock price has appreciated by more than 240% over the past 12 months, indicating incredible market recognition, improved investor confidence, and significant benchmark outperformance. Although it may appear that many positive tailwinds are priced in, I argue that the company may still experience further upside. I think TeraWulf is a buy with a $16.50 price target over the next 12 months, implying about a 24% upside and broader market outperformance. I believe the company may appear as a compelling opportunity for long-term investors seeking exposure to AI data centers and digital assets via equities. The company may experience tailwinds tied to Bitcoin seasonality and AI-driven data center market growth, as I think it seems to be well-positioned to benefit from the strong momentum. Pivot To AI Makes It A More Compelling Play The legacy Bitcoin miners pivot to the landscape of artificial intelligence. Mara Holdings , CleanSpark , Iris Energy , Cipher Mining — these are only a few mining companies, which made a decision to diversify their business and invest in AI cloud services. TeraWulf followed its peers, and the market has rewarded the company with significant appreciation. However, I argue that this may be just the first inning of the high-growth market. WULF: The Stock Price Performance Versus Peers (Seeking Alpha) The chart above indicates WULF stock price performance versus its peers. Over the past 6 months, the company appreciated more than 500%, ranking as the third best-performing out of the five above-stated mining stocks. The chart highlights that before pivoting to AI, the mining companies used to trade closely. However, this diversification into a high-demand AI space has been rewarded with a substantial premium. If AI-driven demand continues, I believe the companies may experience further upside. To support that, the AI data center market was valued at roughly $15 billion in 2024, with expectations to reach $93.60 billion by 2032. This indicates a 23.83% CAGR. These legacy Bitcoin miners are pioneering into the high-demand landscape and may position themselves for multi-year growth. WULF: Market-Cap Of The Legacy Bitcoin Miners (Seeking Alpha) The chart above reveals that these companies appear to be relatively small. TeraWulf is currently about a $5.5 billion market capitalization stock, and considering the massive AI data center market growth expectations, combined with appreciating Bitcoin, this may appear an interesting opportunity to consider. On August 14, the company announced an agreement with Fluidstack , backstopped by Google. This was a 10-year high-performance computing agreement, based on which TeraWulf will allocate over 200 MW of IT load to its Lake Mariner site for AI HPC workloads. Given this, initial contracted revenue reaches about $3.7 billion over 10 years, with a possibility to extend, which may push the total revenue to roughly $8.7 billion, if exercised. This indicates leadership in the AI HPC landscape and supports the bullish narrative for the stock. This also highlights the phenomenal future demand and underscores a roughly 14% stake from Google , making it the largest shareholder of the company. The company is executing strategic decisions tied to further high-performance computing expansion. For instance, the following lease agreement unlocks a possibility to expand the capability up to 400 MW data capacity. This indicates that there may be further upside if AI-driven demand continues, and Wulf is able to successfully scale its operations. The market has rewarded this pivot to AI infrastructure. This reduces dependency on Bitcoin volatility, diversifies business operations and revenue streams, which makes it a more compelling company. Both of the segments — Bitcoin and AI data centers — are currently experiencing a positive sentiment, and I think the trend is likely to continue. Bitcoin Seasonality Is In Play, Which May Spark The End-Of-Year Rally On October 10, the President announced he will impose an additional 100% tariff on China, starting from November 1. This sparked the largest crypto selloff ever, with roughly $19 billion in digital assets wiped out. However, I argue that Bitcoin seasonality may still be in place, regardless of a dramatic sentiment shift. The last three months of the year tend to be the most favorable environment for crypto. The table below indicates that historically, Bitcoin experienced roughly 79% upside on average in Q4 and nearly 48% on a median return basis. WULF: Bitcoin Seasonality ( coinglass.com ) So far, given the China-tariff-related selloff, Bitcoin has declined by 1%. If Bitcoin seasonality plays out, this could spark the end-of-year rally for crypto and equities with crypto exposure. The current administration is pro-crypto, which creates a favorable environment for digital assets. For instance, on July 18, the President signed the GENIUS Act , which establishes a framework for stablecoins. This improves sentiment, investor confidence, and expands the legal basis for digital assets. I think that there may be more pro-crypto legislation in the future, which could also contribute to an end-of-year rally. I think this is significantly beneficial for Bitcoin miners, as demand may increase for equities offering crypto exposure. Also, this could significantly contribute to further Bitcoin appreciation, and miners would be able to benefit from the underlying price increase. Furthermore, this pro-crypto administration helps to adopt digital assets more easily, which makes the landscape favorable from a larger picture perspective. Crypto assets remain volatile, but I think this administration is shaping a more favorable digital asset environment for years to come, which supports the positive outlook. There are more and more publicly listed companies that are adopting Bitcoin as an asset to store wealth. This is important, and I think it significantly contributes to the bullish narrative for WULF. These companies provide a floor price of the underlying because of a HODL strategy, and continuously purchase the asset, maintaining a positive momentum. If Bitcoin seasonality plays out, TeraWulf appears to be well-positioned to benefit from a positive crypto sentiment. Time will tell, but I think that despite crypto volatility and the current selloff, Bitcoin seasonality might still be in play. The Stock Appears To Be Expensive, But Massive Revenue Growth And A Positive Future Outlook Justify It TeraWulf appears to be an expensive stock. However, investors are willing to pay a premium for massive top-line growth and a positive future outlook. If the company continues to execute well, and AI-driven demand proceeds further, I think the legacy Bitcoin miner may continue trading at a premium. WULF: Revenue (TTM) (YCharts) The forward EV/Sales at 28.79 , indicates a substantial premium to peers, roughly 8.5x overvaluation versus the sector median of 3.39. This also may indicate that future growth may already be priced in. However, I think if the company continues to scale and data center demand sustains, investors may be willing to give the stock a higher premium. The forward price/sales at 26.75 supports the thesis of elevated valuation. This also implies a nearly 8x higher multiple than the industry's average of 3.34. WULF: Capital Structure (Seeking Alpha) The company appears to be a medium-leveraged business, with total obligations of $500 million . The legacy Bitcoin miner has roughly $90 million in cash, which partially offsets the debt and improves the capital structure. I also think that this could act as a short-term tailwind for the stock. The company paid $4 million in interest expense last quarter, which is significant and weighs on the bottom line. The Fed is anticipated to reduce interest rates twice by 0.25% by the end of the year , and if it materializes, the company may be able to refinance the debt on more favorable conditions. This could result in lower interest expense, supporting the bullish outlook and contributing to a bottom-line increase. The phenomenal top-line growth supports the bullish outlook and justifies an elevated valuation. TeraWulf grew revenue by 9.82% over the past 12 months, but this was significantly impacted by an ad hoc -19% revenue decline in FQ1 2025 . The forward revenue growth rate of 82.62% is impressive and supports the thesis that top-line expansion is likely to continue. This also highlights roughly 11x outperformance compared to the sector median of 7.47%, supporting premium valuation. WULF: Capital Expenditures (TTM) (YCharts) The company grew CapEx by 154% over the past 12 months, which appears to be substantial and underscores a 22x advantage compared to peers of about 7% growth. If the company can continue growing revenue at such a pace, followed by successful scale in the high-demand AI infrastructure business, I think the stock could trade at a premium valuation further. On the downside, WULF operates at below-market margins, which may weigh on the stock price. The gross profit margin (TTM) of nearly 44% appears to be roughly 12% discounted to the sector median of about 50%. Other profitability metrics are currently negative, highlighting the company's massive focus on investing and scaling its AI cloud business rather than growing its bottom line. I think this is a rational business decision, considering the massive demand for data center infrastructure, and if WULF succeeds in scaling, it could position itself for the years ahead. I believe TeraWulf remains a significant growth story, and that is what investors should focus on. It is challenging to evaluate negative EPS names, but they also tend to be valued on a more forward-looking basis. Wall Street anticipates TeraWulf to turn profitable in FY2027, and I agree with these estimates. Given the agreement with Fluidstack, significant scaling, and AI infrastructure focus, it is likely that the bottom line will remain negative over the next few years. However, the market aims for $0.33 in diluted EPS expectations for FY2027. If we apply a 50x earnings multiple, which would be reasonable for a high-growth name with an AI-related focus, to this bottom-line forecast, we come in at my price target of $16.50. This may come in conservative if the company can successfully expand, but I favor an approach that leaves more room for error. I think WULF may appear to be a compelling opportunity for investors seeking AI exposure to a high-growth AI cloud landscape. Main Risks And Concerns There are risks and concerns tied to TeraWulf, which could impact the stock price significantly in the near term. On Friday, the market experienced a substantial selloff. The SPY fell by 2.70%, raising concerns related to the President's tariffs on China. Although WULF remained almost flat with a 0.59% decline on the day , the risk remains that elevated uncertainty could weigh on the broader stock market. If the negative trend continues, TeraWulf may be impacted, as well. There are risks tied to AI-driven demand and the company's ability to scale in the high-growth market. So far, the infrastructure business has experienced significant capital expenditure investments, driving sentiment higher. If these investments do not translate into meaningful top-line growth, or uncertainties arise related to further demand, sentiment may shift and could drive the stock price down. Also, if the company struggles to scale in the cloud infrastructure business, investor confidence may erode, which could negatively impact stock price performance. The company remains dependent on Bitcoin and its price volatility. A large portion of the revenue comes from mining operations, which could cloud the outlook if Bitcoin experiences a significant selloff. This is an area to monitor for investors, as it could also impact scale in the AI cloud business. On the other hand, if none of the above materializes, the company is likely to expand its operations and strengthen its position in the AI infrastructure market. If Bitcoin seasonality plays out well, and AI-driven demand continues, the company could appreciate in stock price further. Conclusion: TeraWulf Is A Buy I think TeraWulf offers an interesting opportunity for investors who favor the digital asset and artificial intelligence landscapes. This is a high-growth name, which currently significantly focuses on scaling the business and supplying AI-driven demand. The stock appears to be expensive, but tailwinds tied to Bitcoin seasonality and continuation of the artificial intelligence revolution could drive the stock price higher. The forward-looking markets may reprice the AI pivot at an even higher multiple if the company succeeds in meeting scaling expectations and indicates bottom-line growth in the following years. Although Friday's selloff appears to be concerning, I think the environment remains favorable for crypto assets. Seasonality could play out, which could result in the stock price appreciation. Regardless, TeraWulf's shift to AI reduces the dependency on Bitcoin and diversifies the business, making it a more compelling opportunity. I think TeraWulf is a buy with a $16.50 price target over the next 12 months. This suggests a 24% upside possibility, supported by high growth, pivot to AI, and tailwinds tied to a dovish Fed, Bitcoin seasonality, and forward-looking markets. 11 Wall Street analysts forecast a $13.09 12-month price target, implying a roughly 3% downside risk. I feel more bullish about the stock, as I think the AI infrastructure segment remains in its first innings.",WULF,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-13 12:00:00
53082606,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=837192,1760356807,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/53082606.jpeg,Most Coordinated Attack In Crypto History? What Led To $19 Billion In Losses As Bitcoin Price Crashed,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/most-coordinated-crypto-attack/,"The biggest crypto market crash came and went over the weekend, but the effects still linger on. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and nearly every major digital asset suffered price crashes, and what began as a panic over former US President Donald Trump’s surprise 100% tariff announcement on Chinese tech exports soon spiraled into over $19 billion wiped from the crypto market. In the aftermath, some analysts and commentators began piecing together what might have really happened, and many now believe that the crash was not natural but a meticulously coordinated event. The Crash Was Too Synchronized To Be A Coincidence Crypto commentator Ran Neuner was one of the first to argue that the weekend collapse appeared far too orchestrated to be random. In a post on the social media platform X, Reuner pointed out that the sell-off began immediately after US markets closed late on Friday, at a moment when both European and Asian trading desks were asleep. Related Reading: Crypto Crash: $19.5 Billion Wiped Out In Record-Breaking Liquidation Event At the same time, several major oracles began showing inconsistent price data, liquidity across exchanges evaporated, and many users reported being unable to access trading platforms to buy the dip or close positions. Furthermore, crypto data platforms like CoinGecko were either offline or displaying incorrect information, so users had no data about the crash. According to Neuner’s assessment, this was not a string of isolated glitches but a chain reaction of failures happening simultaneously across the ecosystem. This looked like some players had pulled the right levers at exactly the right time, and the crash “was a highly coordinated and well executed attack.” Binance’s Collateral System Was Exploited? Another theory that has gained traction came from a commentator known as ElonTrades, who proposed that the crash was caused by an exploitation of a weakness within Binance’s internal pricing mechanism. His analysis suggests that the event wasn’t a spontaneous panic but a calculated attack that used Binance’s own systems against itself, with the shock of Trump’s tariff announcement serving as the perfect cover. Related Reading: Institutions Dump Massive Amounts Of Bitcoin And Ethereum As XRP And Solana Buying Ramps Up According to ElonTrades, Binance’s Unified Account system, which allows traders to use multiple assets as collateral for leveraged positions, had been operating with a significant vulnerability. Instead of relying on external oracle feeds or stable redemption values to mark collateral, the exchange used its own order-book prices. This meant that if someone could manipulate the price of a collateral asset within Binance, they could instantly devalue billions of dollars in margin accounts. Binance had already announced plans to move to oracle-based pricing, but the rollout wasn’t until October 8. Some traders began dumping $60million to $90 million of USDe and other tokens like wBETH and BNSOL on Binance to force their internal prices down, even though those same assets maintained normal value elsewhere. The artificial plunge in price caused the platform’s margin system to view thousands of leveraged accounts as under-collateralized and caused automatic liquidations. That localized depeg triggered between $500 million and $1 billion in forced liquidations. At the same time, these actors opened $1.1 billion in BTC/ETH shorts on Hyperliquid to take advantage of the depeg, which eventually netted $192 million in profit. Just as the forced liquidations began, Trump’s 100% tariff announcement hit global headlines, adding panic and confusion to the mix. Within hours, the liquidation chain had spread to other exchanges. Regardless of the reason behind the crash, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are starting to recover. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $115,025, up by 2.85 in the past 24 hours. Ethereum is trading at $4,160, up by 8.5% in the past 24 hours.

53083078,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=834861,1760356967,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53083078.jpeg,"Analysts set $100 target for silver by 2026, banking on rising demand and tightening supply",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/analysts-silver-doubling-from-record-highs/,"Silver is on a tear right now. The metal pushed past $50 an ounce for the first time last week, setting off a chain of reaction across commodities desks worldwide. By Monday morning, it was up 2.4%, trading at $51 an ounce, while New York futures surged by 4.5%, sitting around $49, and up by more than 78% this year, well ahead of gold’s 50% rally, according to data from CNBC. The rally is being fueled by heavy demand, tight supply, and the growing hunt for real assets in a world still dealing with inflation and market volatility. Paul Syms, head of EMEA ETF fixed income and commodity product management at Invesco, said gold’s record-smashing run earlier this year led traders to rotate into other metals. “Interest in silver picked up when the gold-silver ratio moved above 100x after the post ‘liberation day’ gold rally,” he said Friday. “The only time the ratio has been above 100x this century was during the pandemic, and that was followed by a sharp reversal.” Syms added that until now, silver hadn’t hit a record since 2011, while gold has set 39 new highs in 2025. Traders eye industrial demand as silver outperforms gold Syms said investors are treating silver as both a store of value and a strategic commodity. Unlike gold, which has limited industrial use, silver is embedded in electronics, solar panels, and renewable energy systems, giving it a dual advantage . “From an investment case standpoint, silver is also perceived as a store of value but has many industrial uses, particularly in electronics and renewable energy technologies,” he said. The ongoing AI semiconductor boom has only added to the pressure, as manufacturers snap up silver for chips, wiring, and circuitry. He also pointed out that silver’s 2025 rally has blown past even bullish expectations. “Sentiment toward gold and silver remains positive and investors generally have relatively low allocations,” he said . “Prices are unlikely to be affected by this being a crowded trade subject to profit taking, particularly while equities also remain at the highs.” Syms noted that as long as optimism holds, silver could extend its climb in the months ahead. Paul Williams, managing director at Solomon Global, agreed that silver’s move is being powered by fundamentals, not speculation. “A deepening structural deficit, record industrial demand, and accelerating investment in green technologies are tightening supply and pushing prices higher,” he said. Williams described this rally as being driven by “real-world forces,” contrasting it with the speculative surge of 1980. “While silver doesn’t share gold’s full safe-haven credentials, its dual role as an industrial and store-of-value metal continues to draw investors seeking stability and upside,” he added. Forecasts suggest a potential climb to $100 Williams said that even after hitting new highs, silver still looks cheap compared to gold, and the bull run could stretch into 2026. “Given the current climate, a $100 silver price is certainly possible by the end of 2026,” he said. He pointed to the growing global investment in green energy, from solar manufacturing to EV infrastructure, as key drivers behind the sustained shortage. Philippe Gijsels, chief strategy officer at BNP Paribas Fortis, has been predicting $50 silver for over a year and now believes the price could easily double from its current level. “Big round numbers tend to attract investors like a magnet,” he said. “Once that price gets in the gravitational field of the big numbers, we typically see an acceleration and a buying climax.” But Gijsels also warned of possible pauses. “What typically happens after a huge run like this is that we see a pause,” he said. “We could see a brief but rather violent pullback, prices may flatline for quite a while, or it could be a combination of both. But somehow the technical overbought condition has to be worked off.” Still, he doesn’t think the story ends here. “Investors have come on board since the beginning of this year,” Gijsels said. “They’ve understood that in an inflationary world, a world where volatility and uncertainty are the new normal, and where central banks keep printing money to keep the system afloat, one needs to hold real assets to protect purchasing power.” He described this phase as only the start of a major commodities cycle. “We are still closer to the beginning than to the end of what could well become one of the largest bull markets in recorded history,” Gijsels said. “I would not be surprised to see silver well north of $100 in the not-too-distant future.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Economy|BTC|Gold|Silver|USD,EN,0,0,TRADING|FIAT|BUSINESS|ZRX|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-13 12:02:47

You Hold It to…,https://timestabloid.com/financial-strategist-you-dont-sell-xrp-to-make-money-you-hold-it-to/,"In the rapidly evolving world of digital assets, a quiet but powerful shift is underway. Increasingly, forward-looking investors are beginning to view certain cryptocurrencies not as tools for short-term speculation, but as long-term investments within the framework of a new financial order. Among these assets, XRP stands out — not just for its speed or efficiency , but for its potential to anchor the next era of global finance. This view is strongly expressed by Versan Aljarrah, founder of Black Swan Capitalist, who argues that XRP’s true value lies in its strategic role in the future financial system — not merely in price appreciation. XRP as an Infrastructure Asset, Not a Trading Token According to Aljarrah, XRP is far more than a tradable coin on the open market; it represents a functional cornerstone of digital liquidity. Designed for instant, low-cost, cross-border settlements, XRP is engineered to bridge disparate financial systems, enabling real-time transfer of value between currencies and institutions. Its consensus mechanism and scalability allow it to move vast amounts of capital efficiently — a feature that makes it uniquely suited for integration into banking and institutional systems seeking interoperability in the age of tokenized assets. You don’t sell XRP to make money. You hold it to be on the right side of the new financial system. — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) October 12, 2025 This infrastructure-level utility , Aljarrah suggests, is why XRP should be viewed as a strategic hold rather than a speculative play. Those who understand its role in the liquidity architecture of a tokenized economy will see holding XRP as equivalent to holding a stake in the rails of tomorrow’s financial network. Institutional Accumulation and Supply Dynamics A key part of the Black Swan Capitalist’s argument is that XRP has a limited supply and is being accumulated by institutions. XRP’s total supply is fixed, and a significant portion is locked in escrow, ensuring transparency and predictability. Recent blockchain data analyses have shown large transactions by institutional wallets and custodians. These movements hint at accumulation by deep-pocketed players preparing for XRP’s broader utility phase. The growing trend of tokenizing assets, along with the increasing use of stablecoins and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), highlights XRP’s rising importance as a bridge for liquidity across different ecosystems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 This evolution, Aljarrah argues, could trigger a supply squeeze — not because of retail speculation, but due to institutional usage that gradually absorbs available liquidity. A Long-Term Vision for the Tokenized Economy Aljarrah’s outlook challenges traditional investment psychology. While many traders focus on taking advantage of price swings and making quick profits, he stresses the importance of being patient and getting into the right position. For him, XRP’s purpose extends beyond short-term financial gain; it’s about alignment with a macro-level transformation — the shift from fragmented, intermediary-heavy finance to a seamless, interoperable global value system. This approach reframes XRP ownership from an act of speculation into an act of foresight. The question isn’t how much profit can be made today, but how well-positioned one is for the infrastructure that will underpin tomorrow’s economy. The Bottom Line Versan Aljarrah’s message is both a challenge and an invitation: to look beyond charts and price cycles, and instead to recognize XRP’s role as a foundational component of the new financial ecosystem taking shape. “You don’t sell XRP to make money,” his statement implies, “you hold it to be on the right side of history.” As the world moves towards tokenization and instant value exchange, those words sound more like a plan than just feelings – maybe they’re a hint about where smart investors are quietly placing their bets.

Accordingly, China Renaissance Bank, a China-based investment bank, is in talks to raise $600 million for a Binance Coin (BNB) investment vehicle in which YZi Labs will also participate. $200 Million Investment on the Way for BNB! China Renaissance Holdings aims to raise approximately $600 million to establish a digital asset treasury centered on BNB. The report also noted that the funds raised will be used to stockpile long-term BNB. China Renaissance and YZi Labs plan to contribute $100 million each, for a total of $200 million. In August, China Renaissance announced a strategic partnership with YZi Labs Management Ltd to accelerate the development of the BNB Chain ecosystem and advance real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. As part of the agreement, China Renaissance will allocate approximately $100 million to BNB, making it the first Hong Kong-listed company to explicitly include BNB as part of its proprietary digital asset allocation.

The past day saw an inflow of high-risk new tokens, moving away from the approach of selected and curated memes. Four.meme will require a small fee for token launches, to avoid spamming with new memes. The platform does not aim to replicate the Pump.fun drive to generate as many tokens as possible. Instead, Four.meme says it wants to prevent rug pulls, though it seems more risky tokens have slipped onto the platform. Four.meme will do a manual review of recently launched tokens after an inflow of users and newly created tokens, leading to rug pulls and low liquidity. | Source: Dune Analytics Four.meme claimed its platform saw an on-chain pollution attack, where an unusual number of creators generated over 32K tokens in a single day. While Pump.fun would accept this activity as normal, Four.meme does not want to create a culture of “trenches” trading risky assets. Until recently, Four.meme relied on curated tokens with liquidity subsidies. All new token launches will require a fee of 0.01 BNB , though the community called for an even higher entry barrier. Coinciding with the inflow of tokens, Four.meme reported heavy traffic and even service delays. For that reason, the new fee will be part of token launches for regular memes, as well as for Meme Rush mode . The launchpad will also not leave the rogue tokens active and will instead go through the contracts manually, removing their liquidity pairs. Despite the expectation of a BNB meme season, the presence of spam tokens, potential rug pulls and farming tokens is seen as a hit on the reputation of Four.meme. Four.meme announced new CTO grant Four.meme prefers to focus on specific communities, with a liquidity allocation grant for selected communities. The platform recently bought tokens from the second batch of its CTO grant. 📢 CTO Grant Program Support Initiative Update 💚 As part of our continued builder support, we’ve just completed new purchases under the 2nd Batch CTO Grant Program. This time, we bought: ✨ $ADOG @aster_adog ✨ $Astherus @astherus_cto ✨ $Palu @palubsc ✨ $AsterINU … https://t.co/OAnGDDDnIe — Four.Meme (@four_meme_) October 13, 2025 Four.meme makes all purchases through its public wallet , while supporting multiple versions of some tokens. However, Four.meme is still careful to avoid copycat tokens and trend dilution. Other incentive programs include launch credits, special grants for GMGN trading, as well as special trading competitions. Four.meme tokens recover from market slump Four.meme tokens are seen as one of the proxy indicators for a Binance season. In total, those assets have a market cap of around $844M , a relatively small valuation given previous meme seasons when a single token could rise to $1B in market cap. Despite this, assets like PALU and 4 remain active, while the platform ensures constant building and on-chain activity. Currently, the heightened meme demand has also led to a series of outages on the platform. The Four.meme activity also leads to PancakeSwap listings and fees, as the DEX easily achieves over $2.35M in daily fees. Four.meme itself locked in $2.45M in daily fees, with peak activity in the past week. At the same time, Pump.fun has decreased its daily fees to $1.45M, as interest in the Solana trenches diminished. Four.meme surpassed Solana’s platform in the past week, as trader sentiment shifted.

The move marks one of XRP’s strongest surges in recent weeks, reigniting optimism across the broader crypto market. The latest surge comes after a sharp sell-off that briefly drove XRP down to $2.37 before buyers swiftly absorbed the selling pressure. The forced deleveraging triggered intense volatility but effectively flushed out weak hands. Now, trading volume and derivatives data show renewed demand for long positions, with XRP’s rapid rebound above $2.60 signaling a clear shift back toward accumulation over capitulation. Technical and on-chain signals paint a cautiously optimistic picture. Reclaiming the 200-day EMA near $2.6–$2.7 would confirm a short-term rebound and set the stage for a potential push toward the $3 psychological zone. Meanwhile, rising on-chain activity and open interest suggest traders are rebuilding positions, momentum that could magnify moves once price tests key resistance. Brad Garlinghouse Declares: Blockchain and Stablecoins are Rewiring the Global Financial System At the 2025 Pantera Capital Blockchain Summit, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse declared that “we’re witnessing the rewiring of the global financial system,” highlighting blockchain and stablecoins as the new backbone of global finance. His remarks signaled a clear challenge to the dominance of legacy banking rails and underscored the accelerating shift toward decentralized financial infrastructure. Garlinghouse emphasized that the next era of global finance will be defined not by legacy systems built decades ago, but by decentralized technologies that enable faster, cheaper, and more transparent transactions. He noted that while traditional financial networks remain burdened by inefficiencies, blockchain-powered systems are driving a paradigm shift toward real-time settlement and inclusive access to liquidity. Garlinghouse’s comments come as Ripple continues to expand its influence in cross-border payments, CBDC initiatives, and tokenized asset solutions. The company’s efforts to integrate with global banking systems and regulatory frameworks have positioned it as one of the key players driving blockchain adoption within institutional finance. He emphasized that stablecoins will be central to the shift toward digital money. Anchored by fiat or real-world assets, they offer the stability and scalability needed for blockchain to earn mainstream trust. This is because the real bridge between blockchain and traditional finance isn’t speculative crypto, it’s stable value on-chain. Conclusion XRP’s break above $2.60 signals more than a rebound, it reflects revived confidence in one of crypto’s most watched assets. With bullish momentum accelerating, holding this level could confirm a broader market reversal and set the stage for the next major rally. Garlinghouse’s vision underscores a pivotal shift whereby global finance is on the brink of reinvention. As blockchain and stablecoins evolve, they’re not merely speeding up transactions, they’re reshaping the very foundations of trust, efficiency, and financial inclusion.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-13 12:16:47

The crypto market soared to over $4T in value just days after a flash crash wiped out nearly half a trillion dollars. The dramatic rebound was led by some of the biggest names in the game: $ETH , $BNB , and $DOGE , all of which shot up by around 10%. The Friday crash was triggered by a surprise announcement from President Donald Trump, who imposed a new 100% tariff on China. This news sent shockwaves through the markets, causing Bitcoin to plummet below $103K. Things then got even wilder when Binance had a glitch that briefly showed some altcoin prices at $0, and a synthetic dollar briefly lost its value on the exchange. But the market started to turn around just as quickly as it fell. President Trump later said that the U.S. wants to help, not hurt, China , and that seemed to calm everyone down. While prices haven’t fully bounced back to their previous highs for everyone, some, including $BNB, even edged higher than before the announcement. One analyst noted that Bitcoin is retesting a ‘golden cross,’ a technical term that has historically triggered significant rallies. As prices were falling, some major players saw an opportunity. BitMine Immersion Technologies bought over 128.7K $ETH worth a staggering $480M. Company chairman, Tom Lee, called the dip a ‘ good buying opportunity. ’ Bitcoin miners MARA Holdings and Strategy’s CEO Michael Saylor also jumped in, hinting that they bought the dip as well. It just goes to show how unpredictable the crypto world is and how quickly things can change, but that savvy investors are always on the lookout for a chance to pounce and seize the next best opportunity. While most of us don’t have millions, that doesn’t mean there aren’t still great opportunities that can yield significant returns in crypto. One such opportunity is PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , which offers a new approach to mining. PepeNode ($PEPENODE): Hi-Ho-Hi-Ho It’s Mining Time Here We Go! Welcome to PepeNode ($PEPENODE) , the meme coin that’s both hype and substance. It’s a revolutionary ‘mime-to-earn’ project that’s changing the game. $PEPENODE is a gamified platform built on the Ethereum network that lets you become a virtual crypto miner.

No expensive hardware, no large electricity bills, and no technical expertise needed. It’s crypto mining made fun and accessible for all. The more you upgrade your virtual mining rig, the more your simulated hash power grows, and the more rewards you accumulate. What are you waiting for? Get in on the project that’s bringing its A-game and has already raised over $1.8M in its presale. Unlocking Massive Rewards and Scarcity $PEPENODE isn’t just about fun; it’s designed to deliver real, long-term value. By participating, you can earn not only $PEPENODE tokens but also popular meme coins like $PEPE and $FARTCOIN as bonus rewards. The project features a powerful deflationary mechanism: 70% of all tokens used for in-game upgrades are permanently burned, reducing the total supply and creating long-term scarcity. This constant token-burning process is designed to boost the value of your holdings over time, and is what makes $PEPENODE one of the next crypto to explode . Early adopters gain an advantage with tiered nodes that provide stronger mining capabilities and attractive staking rewards. With its community-first focus and dedication to fair access, including anti-bot measures, $PEPENODE is designed to stand out. It’s a project that offers a new path to passive income and a vibrant, engaging ecosystem.

Ether fell from $4,750 to $3,500, while several altcoins saw momentary declines of over 80 percent amid vanishing liquidity. Roughly $1 trillion in total market value was erased within three hours on Friday 10, October, as total crypto market capitalisation briefly plunged 22.6 percent from its October high of $4.26 trillion to $3.3 trillion. More than $19 billion in positions were liquidated in a single day, dwarfing previous records set during the COVID crash and FTX collapse. The sell-off was sparked by aggressive spot selling as US-China tariff tensions began escalating on 10 October, creating a 2.5x imbalance between sellers and buyers across major exchanges. Once the news broke of US tariffs on Chinese imports, futures markets compounded the decline, with Cumulative Volume Delta readings showing an overwhelming dominance of sell-side flow across both spot and perpetual markets. Historically, such liquidation-driven capitulations have been followed by mechanical rebounds as volatility compresses and excess leverage is flushed. For Bitcoin, reclaiming and holding above $110,000 would confirm a stabilisation phase and open recovery targets near $117,000–$120,000, while failure to do so risks a retest of the $100,000 zone. The latest economic backdrop in the United States reflects a widening disconnect between policy intent and real-world impact. The Federal Reserve’s September meeting minutes revealed deep divisions within the Federal Open Market Committee over the pace and scale of upcoming rate cuts. While most policymakers favour additional easing to counter slowing job growth, a minority remain concerned that progress on tackling inflation has stalled, and warn against moving too quickly. Compounding the challenge is a surge in economic policy uncertainty , driven by the ongoing government shutdown, shifting tariff policies, and tighter immigration rules. The shutdown has halted key data releases, forcing markets to rely on private indicators showing an economy that is cooling but not contracting. Despite the fiscal gridlock, financial markets have remained resilient. Treasury yields declined as investors sought safety, and a strong response to recent bond auctions highlighted sustained demand for long-duration assets. Credit markets have also held firm: both investment-grade and high-yield spreads sit near two-year lows, signalling steady investor confidence and limited concern over defaults. The past week underscored how crypto and traditional finance are rapidly converging. In Japan, mobile payments giant PayPay acquired a 40 percent stake in Binance Japan, paving the way for its 70 million users to trade and transfer crypto directly within the country’s most popular digital wallet. Institutional finance is also deepening its crypto ties. Digital asset financing group, Antalpha led a $100 million investment to create Aurelion Treasury , soon to become the first Nasdaq-listed corporate treasury backed entirely by Tether Gold (XAUt).Meanwhile, GraniteShares filed to launch 3x leveraged crypto ETFs tracking Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and XRP, expanding Wall Street’s roster of complex digital asset instruments.

Key Takeaways: Digital asset funds saw $3.17 billion in weekly inflows, pushing 2025 totals to a record $48.7 billion despite US–China tariff tensions. Bitcoin dominated trading, with inflows of $2.67 billion and record ETP volumes hitting $53 billion. US spot Bitcoin ETFs added $2.71 billion amid strong institutional demand. The rally in investment products came even as major cryptocurrencies saw sharp corrections, with only $159 million in outflows on Friday, signaling limited investor panic. Year-to-date inflows have now hit a record $48.7 billion, surpassing the full-year total for 2024, according to a Monday report from CoinShares . Bitcoin Leads Record $53B Weekly ETP Volume Despite 7% Price Drop Trading activity surged as digital asset exchange-traded products (ETPs) registered record weekly volumes of $53 billion, more than double the 2025 average. Friday marked the busiest trading day ever, with $15.3 billion in daily turnover. Bitcoin remained the top draw, attracting $2.67 billion in inflows, pushing its 2025 total to $30.2 billion. However, that remains short of last year’s $41.7 billion record. Despite prices sliding 7% following the tariff announcement, Bitcoin volumes hit a new daily high of $10.4 billion. Ethereum also saw strong participation, with $338 million in inflows during the week, though investors withdrew $172 million on Friday, the largest single-day outflow among major assets. Analysts suggest traders viewed ETH as more vulnerable during the correction. Meanwhile, anticipation for upcoming Solana (SOL) and XRP exchange-traded fund launches has cooled, with inflows tapering to $93.3 million and $61.6 million, respectively. Digital asset investment products saw $3.17 billion inflows last week. pic.twitter.com/nDIz7PMcPK — Crypto Crib (@Crypto_Crib_) October 13, 2025 US spot Bitcoin ETFs extended their strong “Uptober” momentum with $2.71 billion in weekly inflows, highlighting sustained institutional demand. According to SoSoValue , total assets under management climbed to $158.96 billion, representing nearly 7% of Bitcoin’s total market cap. The week’s standout session came on Monday, when funds posted $1.21 billion in inflows, the second-largest daily haul since spot ETFs debuted, followed by another $875.6 million on Tuesday. However, sentiment cooled on Friday, when Bitcoin ETFs recorded a small $4.5 million outflow following President Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese imports . Analyst Warns Bitcoin Faces Decisive 100-Day Window Bitcoin may be nearing a critical turning point, according to trader Tony “The Bull” Severino, who believes the next 100 days could determine whether the cryptocurrency enters a parabolic rally or ends its current bull cycle. Severino pointed to the Bollinger Bands indicator on Bitcoin’s weekly chart, which has tightened to levels unseen before, often a precursor to sharp price moves in either direction. Severino cautioned that “head fakes,” or false breakouts, are common during such setups. He noted Bitcoin recently failed to break above the upper band with strength after briefly touching $126,000, suggesting a potential dip before any sustained rally. Currently, BTC trades around $122,700, hovering below its record highs as volatility compresses further. While some analysts fear a looming breakdown, others argue that Bitcoin’s cycles are getting longer, hinting at more room for growth.

Strategy has acquired 220 BTC for ~$27.2 million at ~$123,561 per bitcoin and has achieved BTC Yield of 25.9% YTD 2025. As of 10/12/2025, we hodl 640,250 $BTC acquired for ~$47.38 billion at ~$74,000 per bitcoin. $MSTR $STRC $STRK $STRF $STRD https://t.co/Ft9ZCh1EGx — Strategy (@Strategy) October 13, 2025 The company’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at 640,250 BTC, purchased for an aggregate $47.38 billion at an average price of $74,000 per BTC. The latest accumulation shows Strategy’s continued conviction in Bitcoin as a core treasury reserve asset and follows the company’s ongoing series of equity sales through its At-The-Market (ATM) programs. ATM Programs Fuel Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy funded its most recent Bitcoin purchases using proceeds from its STRF ATM, STRK ATM, and STRD ATM programs. According to the company’s filing, these programs collectively raised around $27.3 million in total notional value during the reporting period. The STRF ATM, tied to Strategy’s 10.00% Series A perpetual strife preferred stock, sold 170,663 STRF shares, generating $19.8 million in net proceeds. Meanwhile, the STRK ATM, associated with its 8.00% Series A perpetual strike preferred stock, brought in $1.7 million from 16,873 shares. The STRD ATM, based on its 10.00% Series A perpetual stride preferred stock, contributed $5.8 million from 68,775 shares. Collectively, these offerings have become key financing vehicles for Strategy’s ongoing Bitcoin accumulation strategy—mirroring the company’s long-standing practice of converting equity proceeds into digital assets. Strategic Expansion Across Equity Classes Beyond its active ATM programs, Strategy maintains substantial capacity for future issuances. As of October 12, the company had $1.7 billion, $4.1 billion, $20.3 billion, and $15.9 billion available for issuance under its various preferred and common stock classes (STRF, STRD, STRK, and MSTR, respectively). This provides a wide financial runway for further expansion of its Bitcoin reserves, signaling that additional purchases could follow as market conditions evolve. Reinforcing Leadership in the Bitcoin Treasury Space With 640,250 BTC now under management, Strategy remains among the world’s largest corporate holders of Bitcoin—alongside peers such as MicroStrategy and publicly listed digital asset firms adopting similar treasury models. The company’s bold move reflects growing institutional confidence in Bitcoin amid tightening monetary policy and increased regulatory clarity across major markets. By blending creative capital-raising strategies with disciplined accumulation, Strategy continues to redefine how corporations integrate Bitcoin into their balance sheets—cementing its reputation as one of the pioneers in the digital-asset treasury landscape.

His remarks focus on institutional coordination and highlight one digital asset he believes is uniquely positioned for integration within traditional banking infrastructure. Banks Coordinate on Stablecoin Initiative Rietveld referenced a group of leading financial institutions , including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Santander, TD Bank, UBS, Citigroup, and others, that are working together on plans for a unified digital settlement instrument. While many of these banks have independently explored blockchain, this reported coordination suggests a shift toward joint implementation rather than isolated experimentation. He emphasized that this initiative appears to be aimed at institutional settlement rather than retail use, marking a potential turning point in how legacy financial systems adopt digital assets and tokenized money. EVERY Major Bank Is ALL IN On #XRP pic.twitter.com/SdvfCf9VKx — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 11, 2025 Institutional Readiness and Ripple’s Track Record Rietveld argued that among existing cryptocurrencies, only XRP is currently equipped for full integration into the global banking system. He attributed this to the Ripple team’s early development of enterprise-grade infrastructure and its established relationships with regulated financial institutions. He highlighted Santander Bank, one of the institutions reportedly involved in the initiative, as already having worked with Ripple’s technology. This connection was used to support his view that banks could align their stablecoin frameworks with systems already tested through such partnerships. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Why XRP Is Central to His View Rietveld pointed to XRP’s design for fast, low-cost cross-border transactions and its role within institutional liquidity corridors. He asserted that if banks introduce a joint stablecoin, they may require an interoperable bridge asset, which, in his view, positions XRP as a logical choice. While he did not claim any official confirmation from the banks, he suggested that the timing and coordination indicate a broader move toward blockchain settlement that could benefit assets already embedded in financial testing environments. Rietveld closed with a strong expectation that XRP may be nearing a major phase in adoption. His analysis reflects growing speculation that if banks formalize a collaborative stablecoin, they may rely on infrastructure with a proven record in institutional use. Though the full scope of the banks’ plans remains undisclosed, his commentary places XRP at the forefront of potential integration within the next wave of digital finance.

The partnership allows institutional investors to use shares of the UBS tokenized money market investment fund, distributed via DigiFT, as collateral for trading on Bybit’s platform. Issued by UBS Asset Management, UBS uMINT is built on the Ethereum ( ETH ) public blockchain and represents the first tokenized investment fund launched by the firm. Opened to external investors in November 2024, it is distributed through authorized partners, with DigiFT, a regulated real-world asset (RWA) platform licensed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. Bridging traditional finance with blockchain innovation Bybit’s integration with DigiFT enables holders of UBS uMINT to use their tokenized fund shares as collateral on the exchange, expanding the utility of regulated financial instruments in a digital environment. “DigiFT is an innovator in regulated blockchain distribution,” said Ben Zhou , Co-Founder and CEO of Bybit. “By working together, we are opening the door for more traditional institutions to unlock further utility from their tokenized money market products. Through the collaboration with Bybit, investors of the UBS tokenized money market investment fund will be able to use their holdings as collateral for trading in a secure and cost-efficient way.

Through this collaboration, DigiFT exemplifies how regulated RWA infrastructure can deliver both capital efficiency and transparency to the financial markets of the future,” noted Henry Zhang, Founder & Group CEO of DigiFT. By integrating regulated tokenized products such as UBS Asset Management’s money market investment fund through DigiFT, Bybit continues to align transparency and compliance with innovation in digital finance.

However, this week’s tense wait for economic data, held up by a US government shutdown, could make or break the market. Here are five things investors should keep an eye on in the coming days: Is the bull market still on after record liquidation Bitcoin’s price jumped back to $114,000 on Monday, a 3.9% recovery from Friday’s lows of $109,700. According to data from CoinGecko, the king coin went up as high as $116,000 during the day after bouncing back from a downward spiral around the weekly close, with market conditions turning against overleveraged traders. According to CryptoQuant contributor ArabChain, liquidity stress on Binance reached its highest levels since the start of 2025. The analyst cited exchange data showing daily trading volume topping 32,500 Bitcoin while the price stabilized around $113,000, and an unusually high liquidity stress ratio stood at 0.2867. The market was seemingly unable to absorb large orders without significant price swings, which ArabChain explained was triggered by mass stop-loss activations and liquidation of leveraged positions en masse. Bitcoin had briefly touched $122,000–$123,000 early Friday, before heavy selling pressure pushed prices toward the $110,000–$112,000 levels. Market analyst Rekt Capital said on X that Bitcoin had rebounded from a “Higher Low” level, the same area that supported a previous reversal, and closed above $114,300. “On the previous five times this has happened, Bitcoin rallied to at least $117,300,” he said, hinting that the coin could continue its upward momentum. US economic data delays due to shutdown, Powell’s speech incoming Crypto traders and stock markets are preparing for a word from the US central bank during the three-week-long US federal government shutdown . A hiatus in the federal arm of the government has delayed the release of key economic reports, including wholesale inflation, retail sales, and housing data. Economists fear the deadlock will lead to policymaking paralysis ahead of the Federal Reserve’s next meeting. Last Friday, President Donald Trump responded to China’s restrictions on rare earth exports by announcing 100% tariffs on imports from the Asian country, which started a sell-off in equities, debt, commodities, and risky assets. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at the NABE annual meeting in Philadelphia on Tuesday, with markets eager for clues about the central bank’s next move. According to CME Group’s FedWatch Tool, traders almost unanimously expect a 0.25% rate cut at the Fed’s October 29 meeting. Binance: Sellers still dominant after market rebound Even after Bitcoin traced its way back to prices above $114,000, Binance reserves data shows sellers are still in control of the market. CryptoQuant reported that the exchange recorded significant swings in Taker Volume activity over the past 48 hours, a time when traders were locked in a battle for short-term momentum. Binance’s Taker Imbalance % indicator was negative on Friday, through the weekend, and into midday on Sunday due to persistent selling dominance. Analysts noted that slight positive readings yesterday could mean investors’ buying interest started to reappear. Still, trading volume on the buy side is relatively low compared to the heavy selling earlier in the week. At the time of this publication, Bitcoin is consolidating below $118,000, lacking the volume strength necessary for a sustained recovery. Per CryptoQuant analyst Frank A. Fetter, implied volatility had also surged to its highest levels since April, a time marred with tariff-induced “Liberation Day” policies that spread uncertainty in global markets.

Reading a crypto whitepaper with the right approach can help in finding the most relevant information about a project, while discovering warning signs of potential risk. What Is a Crypto Whitepaper? A crypto whitepaper is a brief description of a new blockchain project, setting up the main points of the technical and economic side for a new chain. The whitepaper approach follows the tradition of Bitcoin, mixing a technical document with elements of a philosophical rationale. A Brief History: From Bitcoin to ICOs The whitepaper format for crypto projects emerged in response to Bitcoin’s own original document. The Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System whitepaper was first published in a cryptographic message board, later uploaded to bitcoin.org , where it can be found ever since. A few years later, the boom of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) boosted the idea of a crypto whitepaper. In those documents, new projects gave the rationale behind their token supply, utility, and blockchain features. It became customary for all crypto projects to produce a whitepaper, often abridged to a litepaper or even a one-page executive summary. Purpose of a Whitepaper in the Crypto World A crypto whitepaper has two main functions: to educate and to serve as a marketing tool for promoting a token project. For that reason, most modern whitepapers contain a mix of technical features and promises on the project’s potential. This guide will also look through the pitfalls of this approach, letting users debunk unnecessary details or hype. The whitepaper also served to differentiate the new crypto project and present its unique promises and capabilities. Why Reading a Whitepaper Matters Getting familiar with a crypto whitepaper before investing in a project is one of the best practices in the space. With a structured approach, a reader can quickly find the relevant information to vet a project’s potential. Avoiding Scams and Rug Pulls Reading a whitepaper does not guarantee protection against scams, but it can serve to discover red flags. An inconsistent, shoddily written whitepaper with typos may signal that a project may lack the resources or the willingness to produce a quality document. Making Informed Investment Decisions Reading a crypto whitepaper will show the main points of investment decisions. The most important part would be the tokenomics, or the ways the project will secure revenues. A whitepaper will hold information on the token supply, inflation, fees, and incentives. Some projects will also go into details about the team and even potential budgets and revenue streams. While some whitepapers may overstate the future potential, they are giving a glimpse into the potential for the chain’s success or failure. Identifying a Project’s Long-Term Potential A crypto whitepaper can contain hints on the long-term development of a project. Just like Bitcoin’s whitepaper mentioned potential pitfalls and incentives for miners, token and other coin whitepapers contain hints on the future supply, mining rewards and operations, token burns, or other changes. Structure of a Typical Crypto Whitepaper Executive Summary Modern whitepapers, aimed at investors or busy traders, will often start with an executive summary, a few paragraphs with the project’s main points. The summary will describe the project’s goal, a brief outline of the technology and network type, and a short summary of the business model. Reading the executive summary of a crypto whitepaper can also help compare the project to other competitors. Problem Statement and Proposed Solution Crypto projects will single out a problem that has not been solved by existing competitors, and offer their own solution. Problem statements deal with issues like network speed, decentralization, anonymous or veiled transactions. Some chains propose niche problems, such as the handling of images or media. Crypto whitepapers often point out problems that are inherent to blockchains or target existing Internet infrastructure. The problem statement may refer to a decentralized solution for an existing app, social media, or another platform. Technology and Architecture This section will contain the details of what a project’s team wants to launch. It will spell out the type of chain that the team wants to build. In addition, the section will explain whether the project will rely on proof-of-work (PoW) or some form of proof-of-stake (PoS). The project’s team will also explain whether their chain is independent and newly created, or a Layer 2 of an already existing base chain. When reading the technology side of a crypto whitepaper, take note of things like nodes, staking, the rate of token issuance, and the incentives. Usually, the technology of a crypto project is closely connected to the economic side and the investment requirements. You will get an idea of the role of the token you are buying — a means of payment, a utility asset, or a staking asset. The technical section of a whitepaper can also give an idea of which wallets will support the new token, and whether its network is compatible with existing crypto infrastructure. Tokenomics and Token Utility The tokenomics section will move beyond the technical side and explain how the project will generate value. It is important to understand the token supply, how the asset is issued, and if there are incentives like rewards, token burns, or vesting schedules with locked tokens. Some projects will have a more complex tokenomics, with two or three assets. The tokenomics section will usually explain how these tokens interact and what roles they play. Roadmap and Development Timeline The roadmap of a project gives a glimpse into the growth potential, while also raising sketchy signs for potential delays. The project’s main features and promises may take years to materialize, leaving holders with their investment locked. When reading a crypto whitepaper, make sure the roadmap looks viable, and possibly compare it to other similar projects. Team and Advisors A fully doxxed team is usually a positive sign for a project. The lack of a team section, or a pseudonymous team, may be a red flag, especially if the paper includes a high-stakes value proposition and a call to investments. The Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin whitepaper was, of course, anonymous. However, newer projects resemble traditional startups, and their teams are a part of the overall credibility. A pseudonymous team is the second-best, especially if it has other channels for communication through social media. However, pseudonymous teams have been known to disappear overnight. At the same time, some projects with pseudonymous founders have delivered excellent results. When reviewing the team section of the whitepaper, make sure the pictures and identities are verifiable. Check if the team or advisors are related to other projects and if those projects are still viable. Legal and Regulatory Disclosures Whitepapers have no geographical restrictions and may belong to a team based in several regions. Make sure the whitepaper explicitly states its main jurisdiction or any restricted regions. Some whitepapers will have explicit exclusionary lists, often affecting potential investors from the USA, Canada, or other restricted markets. This assures that the project will not be subjected to regulatory requirements in those countries. While many projects exist outside the reach of regulators, this may be a red flag. Make sure you understand the regulatory implications of holding tokens. Regulatory conditions may also change based on previous cases with crypto projects. Use of Funds and ICO/IDO Details A whitepaper will often contain the parameters of a token sale if this is the preferred mode of distribution. In this section, the project will share the percentage of the supply that will be available for sale. Other details may be added, such as the stages of the ICO or IDO, the platform on which it will happen, and when the tokens will be distributed and become tradable. This section may also contain the fundraising goals and the intended usage of the proceeds. The sale page may also contain the assets that will be used for the sale, whether BTC, ETH, stablecoins , or even fiat currencies. Step-by-Step Guide: How to Read a Crypto Whitepaper Step 1 – Start with the Executive Summary Get acquainted with the executive summary. Recall the basics of the project’s proposition, and continue to check the details in other relevant sections. Watch out for hype or over-promises in this part. Step 2 – Assess the Problem and Solution Carefully read what the main goal of the project is, and assess its viability. For instance, is the platform trying to add more transactions per second? Does it target scalability, or does it offer a better decentralization structure? Is the project targeting a market outside crypto, aiming to bring it on the blockchain? This section will help you evaluate whether the project is viable and whether adding a blockchain is really necessary. Can the project deliver on its promise of rivaling established projects, with added tokens? This section will also help you compare the project and see if it was created independently, or if it was built to follow a trend, or compete against other projects. Is another Layer-2 chain truly needed? Is transaction speed really the problem, or is it just used as a selling point? Step 3 – Evaluate the Technology The more crypto projects are launched, the more similarities there are. Some whitepapers will go into detail on their proprietary chains. Others will downplay this part, as on-chain activity is already common. Make sure you understand how the technology fits into existing infrastructure, and if it is compatible with some of the major chains. The choice of technology may give a hint of the project’s economic potential. Is the platform targeting miners, or is it tailored to the needs of traders? Step 4 – Dive Into Tokenomics While reading the whitepaper , take note of the token supply, issuance schedule, token burns, staking, and incentives. How is the token used? Is it just an idle asset, or will it have utility? Tokenomics will also offer an idea of how the asset may trade in the future. Make sure you understand the potential of the asset to find representation on exchanges. For instance, anonymous coins and tokens are no longer easily listed on major crypto exchanges. Step 5 – Examine the Roadmap Check the project’s launch schedule and make sure you will not be left waiting for years for the platform to deliver on its promises. Compare similar projects, and estimate if the team can perform fast enough. Market conditions may change and cause delays in the roadmap. Step 6 – Verify Team Credentials Verify the team’s social media, if available. Totally anonymous teams are rare in whitepapers and may be a red flag. Check the founder’s LinkedIn profile for previous crypto projects, and examine their success or failure. Crypto teams have faced multiple risks, including infiltration by DPRK hackers. Pay attention to the developer team and check their code repositories where applicable. Step 7 – Check for Legal Disclaimers Check if the project is available in your jurisdiction and if there is an exclusion risk. Preview the project’s legal disclaimers and check for potential security law violations. Crypto tokens , even though digital and permissionless, have often been labeled as unregistered securities. Step 8 – Look for Red Flags Evaluate the crypto whitepaper in its entirety to identify red flags. Is the presentation, language, and even spelling too unusual? It may be a warning sign or suggest machine translation and potential language barriers with the team. Evaluate the project’s location and make sure you have some resort to legal representation in case of failure. If the entire whitepaper is mostly focusing on the marketing side or the project’s potential value, this may be a bad sign. Also, be wary if a whitepaper explicitly predicts the token’s price growth over time. Ambitious promises, such as rivaling established projects within a few years, are red flags. Evaluate the team section for warning signs such as lack of information and incomplete profiles. Red Flags to Watch Out For in a Whitepaper Overpromising Without Substance Some whitepapers focus on potential earnings or the future growth of their tokens. While some cryptocurrencies do achieve rapid growth, be wary of whitepapers with unrealistic promises, especially with a vague roadmap. Anonymous Team or Fake Advisors Be wary of anonymous teams, mostly for the risk of disappearance or insider selling. Teams may also be infiltrated by hackers. Look for a full list of social media with complete history, and examine each profile. Poor Tokenomics or Unlimited Supply Tokens with unlimited minting or an extremely large supply may be a bad sign. Tokenomics may also skew the supply to the team or investors, leaving retail buyers with minimal influence. Poor tokenomics may also lead to insider trading. Copy-Paste or Plagiarized Sections Some whitepapers are made in haste to tap into a trend or copy another successful project. Look out for plagiarized sections, outright copy-paste, or possible AI-generated content. Tools and Tips for Analyzing Whitepapers Community and Developer Feedback High-profile crypto projects are closely watched on social media, and some of the analysis may be skeptical or critical. Use social media as a resource for community feedback. Seek out the project’s developers and see how they interact with the community and solve issues. Use Tools like Messari and Whitepaper Databases Check if the whitepaper is included in a reliable database for crypto whitepapers. Are other users reading and understanding the whitepaper? If the project is already launched, use tracking tools to make sure the tokenomics are correct. Check for price performance and results of the token sale. Cross-check Roadmap Milestones For launched projects, check if they have completed their milestones. Use market tracking tools to check for progress during bull or bear markets.",Learn Crypto: Beginner Guides|Bitcoin|BTC|Coingecko|coinmarketcap,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|TOKEN SALE|TRADING|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-13 13:40:25

The cryptocurrency rose 2.67% in the last 24 hours, recovering from last week’s low of $109,700, while global equities and commodities attempted to stabilize. Trump’s message, posted Sunday on social media , struck a notably softer tone: “Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine! Highly respected President Xi just had a bad moment. pic.twitter.com/Xg4il82zF8 — Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) October 12, 2025 The U.S.A. wants to help China, not hurt it.” His remarks came just 48 hours after he’d warned of imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese goods – an ultimatum that sent shockwaves through the markets and sparked a massive sell-off in risk assets and cryptocurrency alike. Markets Rebound as Trade Fears Ease The markets have reacted quickly to Trump’s change of heart, with the S&P 500 rebounding after Friday’s 2.7% plunge, its largest drop since April, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and China’s Shenzhen Composite have trimmed back their losses. An escalation of the trade war between the US and China could cause a whole lot more problems for supply chains and global liquidity. Still, fortunately, it looks like that escalated scenario is less likely now. Bitcoin, often seen as a safeguard against any uncertainty, appears to have benefited from the improved mood. This new optimism comes as ETF inflows have picked up, and even the big players that had been sitting on the sidelines have started to dip their toes back in the water. Some analysts believe that as long as the situation remains calm, there’s a good chance Bitcoin can regain some momentum. Key takeaways: Trump’s softened tone reduces immediate trade war risk. Global equities stabilize, lifting crypto sentiment. Bitcoin’s short-term recovery remains technically driven. Bitcoin Technical Outlook: Bulls Target $122,000 On the charts, Bitcoin price prediction remains bearish in a short-term consolidation phase, holding between $112,700 support and $116,100 resistance. The two-hour chart shows a developing bullish flag pattern, a structure that often signals continuation after correction. The 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $114,600 continues to act as a pivot zone, while the 100-period simple moving average (SMA) near $117,300 serves as the next key resistance. A breakout above $117,600 could validate a new bullish leg, with targets at $119,800 and $122,500, representing a complete retracement of the previous decline. Meanwhile, the RSI has risen to 52, hinting at improving momentum after reaching oversold levels last week. A series of long lower wicks on recent candles also points to aggressive dip-buying behavior, a pattern consistent with accumulation phases seen before prior upswings. If support near $112,700 fails, downside risk remains toward $111,000–$109,700, where demand has historically returned. Investor Sentiment: Calm Before the Climb? With tensions cooling and the flow of money back into the system, we might be on the cusp of a period of stabilization for Bitcoin before the next big move. Technical analysis suggests that if it can close above $116,000, then that would likely confirm a change in trend and send the price on a path towards $122,000 over the coming weeks. Trump has changed his tune, which may be enough to calm the markets and allow Bitcoin to regain its footing. As investors regain confidence and ETF inflows stabilize, we begin to wonder if this could be the start of the next significant crypto bull run, heading into late 2025. Bitcoin Hyper: The Next Evolution of Bitcoin on Solana? Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is bringing a new phase to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The weekly ETP volumes totaled $53 billion, trading volumes hit all-time highs, and Friday’s daily volume closed at $15.3 billion. CoinShares research data also revealed that Bitcoin ETFs led the way with $2.67 billion in inflows, followed by Ethereum ETFs with $338 million, Solana ETFs in third place with $93.3 million, and XRP ETFs recording $61.6 million in inflows. However, their combined AUM dropped by 7% to $242 billion. Cryptopolitan reported on October 8 that digital asset investment products had inflows of $5.95 billion during the first week of October, marking the highest single-week inflows since the beginning of 2025. Most of these inflows were from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana ETFs as concerns over interest rates, inflation, and government shutdowns left investors wary of traditional markets. CoinShares breaks down flows by provider and asset Total flows by provider and asset as of October 10. Source: CoinShares CoinShares research data, as of the close of October 10, showed that BlackRock’s iShares led the providers category with weekly flows of $3.36 billion, MTD inflows of $5.34 billion, YTD inflows of $38.97 billion, and over $110 billion in AUM. It was followed by the Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) with weekly inflows of $89 million, MTD inflows of $427 million, YTD inflows of $992 million, and $24.192 billion in AUM. 21Shares had the next highest inflows, with weekly inflows of $92 million, MTD inflows of $14 million, YTD inflows of $393 million, and about $5.8 billion in AUM. Bitwise followed it with weekly inflows of $40 million, MTD inflows of $181 million, YTD inflows of $354 million, and $5.47 billion in AUM. However, Grayscale and ARK 21 recorded similar performances with weekly outflows of $110 million and $12 million, respectively. Their YTD outflows stood at over $1.75 billion and $125 million, respectively, but both managed positive MTD flows of $13 million and $75 million, respectively. CoinShares XBT Provider was the only provider with complete negative flows, recording weekly outflows of $27 million, MTD outflows of $37 million, and YTD outflows of $735 million. However, ProShares only recorded weekly outflows of $22 million but had cumulative MTD inflows of $85 million and YTD inflows of $1.49 billion. Bitcoin ETFs recorded positive flows last week Bitcoin ETFs recorded weekly inflows of $2.67 billion and MTD inflows of $5.13 billion, bringing their YTD inflows to an ATH of $30.21 billion and boosting their AUM to $188.69 billion. However, this year’s YTD inflows are well below the $41.7 billion recorded over the same period in 2024. Friday’s daily inflows were only $0.39 million, although volumes on price correction for the day were at $10.4 billion, the highest on record. Ethereum ETFs also saw weekly inflows of $338.3 million and MTD of $1.07 billion, bringing their YTD inflows to $13.99 billion. Their AUM remained above $36 billion despite Friday’s outflow of $172 million, the largest of any digital asset. However, inflows of Solana (SOL) ETFs and XRP ETFs slowed to $93.3 million and $61.6 million, respectively, despite the hype surrounding the launch of SOL and XRP U.S. ETFs. XRP ETFs also performed poorly with MTD outflows of $51.6 million, as SUI, LTC, Cardano, and Chainlink ETFs recorded positive flows throughout. The U.S. towered above other countries in the “Flows by Exchange Country” category, recording weekly inflows of $3.01 billion, MTD inflows of $6.17 billion, YTD inflows of $45.28 billion, and $169.83 billion in AUM. Switzerland had the next-best weekly inflow performance, with digital asset investment products generating $132 million, more than double Germany’s $53.5 million. However, Germany had comparatively better MTD and YTD inflows at $117.4 million and $1.85 billion, respectively. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The decision allows WazirX to restart operations and begin repayments through token-based distributions, though timelines vary from weeks to months. Meanwhile, crypto betting platform Shuffle recently suffered a massive data breach after its third-party service provider, Fast Track, was compromised, exposing the personal data of most users. Both of the incidents shed some light on the crypto industry’s ongoing struggle with security vulnerabilities. WazirX Recovery Plan Gets Green Light Crypto exchange WazirX secured approval from the Singapore High Court for its long-awaited restructuring plan . This is a huge milestone in its efforts to compensate users that were affected by the $234 million hack that occurred in July of 2024. The court’s decision comes weeks after creditors backed a revised proposal, which paved the way for the exchange to initiate repayments through a token-based fund distribution and begin reviving its halted operations. In a post on X , WazirX founder Nischal Shetty shared his gratitude to the exchange’s community by stating, “Thank you to everyone who supported this difficult phase of WazirX. The Singapore High Court has approved the scheme. It’s your support and love that has made this possible.” The approval concludes over a year of legal and regulatory challenges that the India-based exchange faced while trying to recover funds and compensate more than 150,000 affected users. The breach targeted WazirX’s Safe Multisig wallet, and led to the theft of approximately $234 million in digital assets. It also forced the exchange to suspend withdrawals. Investigations later linked the incident to North Korean hackers and techniques typically associated with the notorious Lazarus Group. Earlier this year, WazirX’s creditors approved a similar restructuring proposal, but the Singapore High Court initially rejected it due to concerns over how recovery tokens—central to the repayment plan—would operate under new regulatory frameworks for digital token service providers. The latest approval indicates that these regulatory issues have now been resolved, which allows the exchange to proceed. While Shetty indicated that users could start receiving their funds within 10 days of the plan taking effect, others involved in the restructuring process suggested a more cautious timeline. George Gwee , a director at Kroll—the firm overseeing the restructuring—estimated that repayments may take up to two or three months after the court’s approval. Statement from WazirX founder Nischal Shetty (Source: WazirX ) Although WazirX has not published a definitive repayment schedule yet, the recent ruling signals that users are finally creeping closer to recovery after one of the most high-profile exchange hacks in India’s crypto history. Shuffle Hit by Major Data Breach While WazirX is taking steps in the right direction, other platforms are still grappling with crypto crime. Shuffle, a leading crypto betting platform, recently fell victim to a major data breach after its third-party customer service provider, Fast Track, was compromised. The incident reportedly exposed the personal data of most of Shuffle’s users. Founder Noa Dummett revealed in a post on X that Fast Track, which Shuffle used for programmatic email sending and user communications, suffered a breach that affected a big portion of its customer base. While Dummett did not specify exactly what data was exposed, the involvement of the CRM system suggests that user email addresses and communication records may have been compromised. Dummett confirmed that the company is investigating how the breach occurred and where the data may have ended up, and added that Shuffle is now seeking alternatives to Fast Track to avoid similar risks in the future. Shuffle ranks among the top 15,000 most-visited websites globally, according to SimilarWeb . This indicates that the number of potentially impacted users is quite substantial. Security vulnerabilities still plague the cryptocurrency industry. Even when breaches only expose basic data like email addresses, crypto users face unique dangers because attackers can exploit the information to launch phishing campaigns or social engineering attacks to steal private keys and funds. Unlike in traditional finance, stolen cryptocurrencies cannot be reversed or recovered once transferred. The past few months have seen a troubling rise in similar incidents across the crypto ecosystem. Platforms like Crypto.com, Bitcoin Depot, and Coinbase have all been affected by data leaks or employee-related security lapses. Beyond the risk of online scams, leaked information about crypto holders can also lead to physical threats. A growing number of “$5 wrench attacks,” where victims are coerced or assaulted to reveal their private keys, has raised safety concerns worldwide. Overall, the Shuffle breach serves as a stark reminder of how reliance on centralized third-party service providers is still a weakness in the crypto industry.",News|Security,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|ASIA|BTC|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-13 14:00:00

The partnership was unveiled on October 13 and introduces an “Attackathon” designed to stress-test the proposed XRPL Lending Protocol ahead of its expected validator vote later this year. Through this initiative, top-tier Web3 security researchers from around the world are invited to identify vulnerabilities in the protocol, competing for a $200,000 prize pool. XRPL Goes Institutional According to the official press release shared with CryptoPotato, in addition to the bug-hunting competition, the Attackathon Academy will provide participants with targeted training on XRPL technology, running from October 13 to November 29. The XRPL Lending Protocol itself represents a major step in Ripple’s enterprise-focused blockchain strategy, offering pooled lending and underwritten credit natively on the XRPL. The system is designed to automate the full loan lifecycle, from issuance to repayment, while linking borrowers to global liquidity sources and enabling lenders to earn yield on idle assets. By integrating with existing risk and compliance processes, the protocol aims to improve transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in credit markets. In a statement, Jasmine Cooper, Head of Product at RippleX, said, “XRPL was designed to support secure, real-world financial applications, and that’s especially important as lending is introduced to the network. This initiative is about making sure the proposed Lending Protocol is thoroughly tested and resilient before launch, so developers and institutions can build with confidence. Partnering with Immunefi allows us to work with some of the top security researchers to help strengthen this new layer of XRPL’s DeFi infrastructure.” XRPL Sees Strong September Activity September 2025 was a busy month for the XRPL ecosystem with product improvements, compliance milestones, and community growth. As reported by CryptoPotato , self-custody cryptocurrency wallet Joey Wallet simplified onboarding, integrating MoonPay, First Ledger, and XRPCafe, while XRPScan introduced an amendment voting timeline for transparency in validator decisions. Xaman Wallet 4.2.1 removed trustline requirements and allowed seamless token transfers and MoonPay Sell integration for full fiat-to-XRP flows. On compliance, the Credentials amendment went live, enabling decentralized on-chain identity verification for regulated interactions. DeFi and gaming also saw progress. Gamechain went live on testnet through XRPL Commons partnerships, and the XRPL Commons Aquarium Residency welcomed builders from 11 countries.

53086691,604655,1760364020,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53086691.jpeg,Bitcoin Derivatives Market Hit Hard With Massive Sweep In Open Interest – Here’s What To Know,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-futures-oi-hit-hard/,"Bitcoin, the flagship digital asset, took a big hit during the recent massive liquidation that tumbled the broader cryptocurrency market over the weekend . While the price of BTC dropped sharply, losing key support levels, its futures open interest also witnessed a notable bearish activity. Unprecedented Shakeup In Bitcoin Derivatives Market The crypto market is gradually recovering from the recent wave of liquidation, considered the largest one yet. During the massive liquidation, Bitcoin’s derivatives market has experienced one of its most dramatic shakeups in history. In the X post , Glassnode, a financial and on-chain data analytics platform, revealed that its futures open interest saw the largest single-day wipeout on record. Within hours, billions of dollars in leveraged positions were liquidated, causing exchanges to tremble and traders to frantically reassess their positions. Data from the on-chain platform shows that more than $11 billion in positions were cleared during the largest liquidation event in crypto history. The historic flush in futures open interest could be a turning point for institutional and retail players negotiating this new stage of market volatility. According to the platform, the magnitude of this deleveraging indicates the speed at which excessive leverage can unravel in times of volatility. This massive wipeout has triggered a resurgence of debate over market leverage, volatility, and the wider effects for the current price trajectory of Bitcoin . Spot Trading Volume On BTC And Altcoins Despite the severity of the liquidation within the week, the market still points to bullish potential based on spot trading volumes on Bitcoin and altcoins. Darkfost, a market expert and author, stated that the intensity of the market movement on October 10th might have a positive effect in the medium term. According to the on-chain expert, a huge number of futures positions, leveraged borrowing, and other margin-based bets were destroyed in this avalanche of liquidation. As a result, many investors lost part of their funds during this event. Darkfost highlighted that this is a stark reminder that any leveraged position carries risk, regardless of how small the leverage appears despite the seeming smallness of leverage. However, by bringing investors’ focus back to the spot market, this liquidation event may also have a positive impact on the market. Presently, spot trading volumes on altcoins experienced a surge as liquidation rocked the market, reaching around $20 billion. Additionally, BTC spot volume doubled, validating the newfound interest in non-leverage trading. Looking ahead, Darkfost predicts a possible stronger preference for the spot market . Such development would aid the crypto market in building a more sustainable and resilient trend as opposed to leveraged positions that may be wiped out at any time. At the time of writing, BTC’s price was trading at $115,165, demonstrating a more than 3% increase in the last 24 hours. Its trading volume has followed this gradual increase by rising nearly 5% in the past day.",Bitcoin News|altcoins|bitcoin|Bitcoin Futures Open Interest|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Spot Trading Volume|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Darkfost|Glassnode|Spot Market,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|BTC|TRADING|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-13 14:00:20

Many investors are sitting on their holdings, expecting others to be the first to use the XRP Ledger (XRPL) for real-world purposes. The logic feels sound: why take the first step when adoption will eventually come on its own? Yet according to Vet, a respected XRPL validator, this passive approach is one of the biggest obstacles standing in the way of XRP’s true potential. The Waiting Game Holding XRP Back Vet’s recent insight cuts deep into a behavior that has quietly shaped the XRP ecosystem. While the ledger’s technology is fully equipped to handle fast, low-cost transactions and tokenized assets, too many holders are waiting for “someone else” to prove its utility. In doing so, the community risks stalling the very growth it hopes to see. The XRP Ledger isn’t in its infancy. It’s a robust, enterprise-ready blockchain network with hundreds of validators, advanced consensus mechanics, built-in token issuance, decentralized exchange functionality, and extremely low transaction fees. Truth is most XRP holders wait for other people to use XRP and the XRP Ledger. But if everyone waits for the next person to do it then… — Vet (@Vet_X0) October 12, 2025 Yet, despite these capabilities, activity remains limited largely to speculative trading rather than practical use. Vet’s warning is clear — the technology is ready, but the users aren’t. The Validator’s Perspective As a validator, Vet has a unique vantage point. Validators see the heartbeat of the network — transaction volumes, node activity, and token movements — metrics that paint a clear picture of how the XRPL is being used. And what he sees is telling: much of the network’s activity still revolves around internal or exchange-based transactions, not the kind of real-world usage that drives sustained adoption. In Vet’s view, this has created a dangerous loop. Holders wait for businesses to start using XRP, while businesses wait to see evidence of user demand. Each side expects the other to make the first move, and as a result, progress stalls. His message is both practical and urgent: if everyone keeps waiting, nothing changes. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 From Passive Holding to Active Engagement Vet isn’t suggesting that XRP holders become developers or start billion-dollar projects. Instead, he’s calling for action at every level — no matter how small. This could mean supporting on-chain payment initiatives, experimenting with tokenized projects, or simply using XRP for transactions instead of letting it sit idle in a wallet. These small acts of participation matter. They show measurable on-chain activity, attract developer interest, and demonstrate to institutions that the ledger is not just a speculative playground but a functioning network with real users. In other words, utility begins when holders decide to use what they already have. A Call to Lead, Not Wait Vet’s message to the community is both a warning and an invitation. The XRPL has everything it needs to become a global payments and tokenization backbone — proven reliability, enterprise-grade performance, and strong ecosystem support. What it lacks is consistent, grassroots-level engagement from its own community. “The ledger is ready,” Vet implies, “but adoption starts with you.” His challenge is simple: stop waiting for someone else to lead the charge. Be the example. Use the technology, support projects, and bring the XRPL vision to life through action. Because if every XRP holder waits for the next person to do it, the future they’re waiting for may never come.

The daily trading volume also rose 40%, to $10.7 billion, suggesting renewed buying sentiment following a wipeout sparked by President Donald Trump’s declaration of a 100% tariff on Chinese imports, which triggered $19 billion in crypto liquidations within minutes. As of the time of writing, daily XRP open interest, the total value of outstanding futures and options contracts that have not been settled, is up 2.38%, sitting at approximately $1.36 billion, according to data Finbold retrieved from CryptoQuant . XRP 24-hour open interest. Source: CryptoQuant This spike indicates a sharp and quick uptick in leveraged positioning, as traders re-enter the market to capitalize on the increased volatility. More precisely, increasing percentages following a sudden price rebound could suggest fresh money flowing into bullish bets, i.e., those hoping the asset’s recovery could extend further. However, elevated open interest can also amplify liquidation risk if the price reverses again. In simpler terms, the higher the leverage, the greater the chance that a sudden downturn could trigger forced sell-offs. XRP price action As of the time of writing, XRP is changing hands at $2.58, still down more than 14% on the weekly chart and way below the psychological $3 level. XRP weekly price. Source: Finbold From a technical standpoint, bears have the upper hand, as the crypto still remains below the 200-day exponential moving average ( EMA ) of $2.63. The relative strength index ( RSI ) of 34.5, in contrast, shows shor-term oversold conditions. XRP is also below its July consolidation range, with the $2.62 zone now acting as a strong resistance cluster. A slip below $2.30 risks a further drop, potentially to $2. Conversely, reclaiming $2.74 (38.2% Fibonacci retracement ) could reignite momentum toward $3.10. Until that breakout occurs, however, downside risk prevails, with initial support seen near $2.30. The outlook is made more pessimistic by recent whale activity as well, as a total of 23,880,253 XRP (worth approximately $62.64 million) was transferred from an unknown wallet to the Binance exchange earlier today. Namely, such large transfers tend to signal that large holders are positioning to sell, potentially putting pressure on market sentiment and price stability.

While BTC has recovered to $114,000 and Ethereum (ETH) to $4,100, one analyst noted that Bitcoin could fall below $100,000. Market analyst Omkar Godbole said that Bitcoin risks falling below $100,000 after failing to break above its key trend line for the third time, according to Coindesk. Bitcoin could drop below $100,000 after failing to break the long-term trendline connecting the 2017 and 2021 peaks for a third time, according to the analyst. The analyst noted that Bitcoin's three consecutive failures could be seen as a pattern rather than a coincidence, and that this pattern has become the resistance that limits Bitcoin's upward momentum. At this point, the analyst said Friday's crash was the third instance of bulls failing to hold above the critical trend line drawn from the 2017 and 2021 highs. This increases the risk of Bitcoin experiencing a deeper decline to $100,000 or below. “Bitcoin has failed three times to break above the long-term trend line connecting the 2017 and 2021 peaks, reaffirming a medium-term downtrend. This trendline is acting as a key resistance in the current bullish cycle and technically, three failures form a pattern.” The analyst also noted that the long-wick candles formed throughout July, August and October indicated a significant loss of upward momentum, while the monthly MACD histogram remained lower compared to the December-January rally. As a result, the analyst noted that the upward movement in these indicators has weakened and is signaling weakness around the historical trend line. Bitcoin failed to hold above the trend line on its third attempt, making the resistance zone a key battleground for the cycle. “The MACD histogram also remains in positive territory, but at a lower level than in the December-January rally, suggesting weakening upward momentum.” The analyst recently noted that in the event of a potential downside, the primary support level is the 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at $107,000. A break below this level could send the price falling below $100,000. Conversely, the analyst pointed to $121,800 for a bullish rally. “Bitcoin clearly needs to break above $121,800 to enter an uptrend,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

It’s stood the test of time. It’s a digital fortress. It’s the king of crypto. We’re talking about Bitcoin, obviously. Everyone knows it for being secure and decentralized. But there’s a flip side to that coin: it’s also incredibly slow and has scalability issues. Think about it like this: comparable blockchains like Solana can handle thousands of transactions per second , whereas Bitcoin struggles to even do ten. It means that simple, everyday tasks, like buying a sneaky treat, can take ages and cost way too much in fees when the network is busy. But with Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER), it doesn’t have to be. Bitcoin is like trying to drive a Ferrari on a dirt road; it’s just not built for speed. Because of this, Bitcoin is a fantastic store of value, but it’s not a great tool for the fast-paced world of DeFi, NFTs, and other new digital apps. The pressing question has always been how to make it faster without breaking the things that make it so strong. Now the answer is clear: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . Bitcoin’s Solution: $HYPER a Turbo-Charge for Bitcoin Let’s be clear, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) isn’t trying to replace Bitcoin; it’s here to give it a major powerup. Bitcoin Hyper is a Layer-2 network, meaning it’s a separate, high-speed network that sits on top of Bitcoin’s main blockchain. Here’s the cool part: it uses the same tech that makes Solana so fast, the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM). This allows Bitcoin Hyper to process thousands of transactions per second, leaving Bitcoin’s main chain to handle the large, slow, and highly secure transactions. The technology behind this is quite impressive. It utilizes a Canonical Bridge to enable you to transfer your Bitcoin to this fast new network. Below is a brief overview; for the full project details, please visit this link . Bridging Your $BTC: You send your Bitcoin to a special address, and it gets securely locked up on the main chain. Wrapped $BTC : An identical amount of ‘wrapped $BTC’ is created on the Bitcoin Hyper network. This is the version you use for all your fast transactions. Go, Go, Go : Now you’re in the fast lane. You can make super-fast payments, use dApps, and do all the cool crypto stuff you couldn’t do before, all with low fees. Security : All these fast transactions are grouped together and regularly sent back to the main Bitcoin blockchain, allowing Bitcoin Hyper to leverage all of Bitcoin’s security. Withdrawing : When you’re done, you can easily burn your wrapped $BTC and retrieve your original Bitcoin. This transforms Bitcoin from a long-term investment into something you can use every single day. It could finally give Bitcoin the app ecosystem it’s been missing. Liking the sound of Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) already? Allow us to help you through the buying process . Investors Are All In The financial world is clearly paying attention. $HYPER’s presale has been an enormous success, raising over $23.3M already. This indicates that both big-time investors and everyday people recognize the significant potential. Serious money has also moved in, like a huge $28.2K whale buy on Saturday, further proving smart money is getting on board. The early success is a massive signal of trust. As it’s still in presale, the recent market crash hasn’t impacted it, so investors can rest easy. The presale is designed to reward early adopters, with the token price increasing as more people join in. And with an incredible 50% staking reward, it’s a win-win for early supporters. Our experts have reviewed $HYPER and predict it could soar to $0.32 by the end of the year. If that was the case, and you bought at today’s price, you’d be getting an ROI of 2341%. $HYPER isn’t just another crypto buy. It’s a strategic move that could redefine Bitcoin’s future, unlocking its true potential and making it an active force in the digital economy. Get your $HYPER now for $0.013105.

The Xiaomi SU7 sedan’s accident brought back concerns about the safety of electric vehicles. Xiaomi Corp. shares fell sharply on Monday, hitting their lowest level since April, after it was reported that one of its SU7 electric sedans was involved in a fatal crash in the southwestern city of Chengdu. The company’s stock dropped as much as 8.7% as videos of the incident spread rapidly across Chinese social media platforms. Xiaomi’s stock plunged to its lowest level since April after videos of a fatal accident spread on Chinese social media. Source: Google Finance Xiaomi shares decline after SU7 crash According to multiple Chinese media outlets, including National Business Daily and Dahe Daily, the SU7 crashed and burst into flames early Monday morning. Footage circulating on Weibo, a Chinese social media platform, shows the vehicle engulfed in fire as bystanders attempted to pry open its doors. Reports said at least one person, who is believed to be the driver, was trapped inside the car and could not be freed before the flames spread. Authorities in Chengdu have not released official details regarding fatalities or injuries, and Xiaomi has not yet issued a public statement. Xiaomi entered the electric vehicle market earlier this year with high expectations, but this incident, coupled with an earlier fatal SU7 crash , has put a lot of pressure on the company. The SU7 sedan was launched as the company’s flagship EV and has been marketed as a direct competitor to Tesla’s Model 3. Growing concerns about electric door handles The crash has also reignited debate about the safety of electronically operated car doors, particularly those with flush or fully concealed handles. These designs, popularized by Tesla, rely on powered mechanisms that may fail during a collision or power loss, and it can prove fatal in situations where users or rescuers need quick manual access. In September, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened an investigation into certain Tesla Model Y door handles following a string of incidents in which occupants were unable to exit vehicles after accidents. A separate Bloomberg investigation reported multiple cases of people being injured or killed when Tesla doors failed to open after crashes or electrical malfunctions, leaving them trapped inside vehicles that caught fire. In China, state media reports have indicated that a top Chinese regulator is considering restricting or outrightly banning fully concealed door handles in future vehicle models. Monday’s crash has prompted fears that Xiaomi’s image could suffer lasting damage, particularly if the cause of the accident is discovered to be related to hardware or software issues.

Ripple (XRP) doesn’t seem as appealing as it once was as 2025 progresses. Even though it has excellent fundamentals, many traders are looking at new ventures that offer innovation, excitement, and the chance to make money faster. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) is a project that consistently resurfaces. It’s getting a lot of attention in the meme and DeFi worlds. Ripple’s Recent Performance Ripple technology continues to facilitate seamless business transactions with banks and other financial institutions across borders. But the price action tells a different story, even with that basis. XRP is presently worth about $2.98. It is unstable, but it isn’t expanding as rapidly as smaller-cap tokens. After the news broke that the SEC had formally dropped its last case against Ripple, the coin experienced a slight increase in value. This cleared up any remaining questions about the rules. XRP won this court case, but its market momentum has slowed down. Many large investors are buying stocks, but not as many regular people are. The overall tone remains steady, not overly excited, which is beneficial for long-term investors but may not be ideal for most traders seeking rapid profits. The market is becoming increasingly interested in newer tales, especially meme-based ecosystems that combine comedy, community, and the latest blockchain technologies. The current cycle has demonstrated that individual investors are willing to take on more risk to generate higher returns in the short term. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) comes into play at that point. Little Pepe ($LILPEPE): The Next Big Meme-Tech Hybrid Little Pepe isn’t simply another meme coin that people are excited about. It’s developing a real blockchain ecosystem that will revolutionize how meme tokens work. The coin is now in Stage 13 of its presale and is selling for $0.0022. Interest is growing quickly. It has also raised more than $26.8 million. It plans to create a separate Layer-2 blockchain specifically for meme currencies, making it more useful than most meme projects. Little Pepe, apart from its tech, appreciates people in the community. It has gained popularity on X and Telegram due to its Mega Giveaway, valued at 777,000 and 15 ETH. This presale is even more thrilling because every Little Pepe ($LILPEPE) bearer is instantly entered into our famous $777,000 Giveaway. To enter, all you have to do is send in your ERC20 wallet, do the social chores, and buy Little Pepe ($LILPEPE). That’s all there is to it. Don’t delay; buy now at https://littlepepe.com to make sure you have a chance to win big! The giveaway expires when Stage 17 sells out. When comparing XRP with Little Pepe, it’s easy to see the difference in stability and potential upside. Ripple has a stable network and established relationships with institutions, but its benefits are expected to materialize gradually. Little Pepe, on the other hand, is unpredictable, unstable, and full of potential, which is precisely what early investors look for during bull cycles. If stimulus checks or new waves of liquidity flood the crypto market later this year, regular traders will likely opt for narrative-driven ventures that are inexpensive over established assets. In that setting, Little Pepe’s low price during its presale, combined with its growing Layer 2 ecosystem, makes it an interesting choice for investors. Conclusion Ripple isn’t expected to grow in the near future. It is a coin for people willing to buy and hold, and wait a long time for the price to increase. Little Pepe, on the contrary, has emerged as a new and thrilling contender. It differentiates itself from the other new entrants in the market due to its audited tech, meme-inspired marketing, and speedy presale. For those willing to take a bit more risk for greater returns, Little Pepe is the meme currency for the new generation. The change is evident as the cryptocurrency market prepares for its next major cycle. Ripple is quietly building, while Little Pepe is gaining the attention of traders worldwide.

Bitcoin fell to $102,000, while Ethereum fell to $3,400. Following a subsequent recovery, analysts noted that Binance's BTC Leverage Pulse (BBLP) indicator had entered the low-risk zone (0.82) and signaled a buy signal. CryptoQuant analyst with the pseudonym CrazyBlock said in his analysis that the proprietary leverage analysis indicator 'Binance BTC Leverage Pulse (BBLP),' which detected the market overheating just before the sharp crash in Bitcoin, has returned to the low-risk zone and issued a buy signal. The analyst said that the BBLP indicator stands out in the short term with an overheated leverage ratio, according to the 2023-2025 data. Citing this as an example, the analyst noted that generally, when the ratio reached 1.4, price corrections occurred within 57% of the time, with volatility more than doubling within 30 days. Conversely, when BBLP entered the low-risk zone, there was an average recovery of 12%. At this point, the analyst said that the BBLP indicator had crossed the 1.42 ratio, signaling market overheating, ahead of Friday's massive billion-dollar liquidation. “Generally, when the BBLP ratio rises above 1.4 it is interpreted as an overvalued (sell) signal, and when it falls below 0.8 it is interpreted as an undervalued (buy) signal. At this point, BBLP has now entered the low-risk zone (0.82). This will be a good entry opportunity.” *This is not investment advice.

Their core value lies in establishing legitimacy: creating an official record, anchoring critical milestones, and providing stakeholders with a durable citation. If you're asking whether crypto press releases still deliver tangible results , the answer is yes—but they operate as an image tool first, and only occasionally as a demand-generation lever. Table of Contents The Attribution Problem Why ""Image Tool"" Is the Right Framework Image Tool vs. Lead-Gen Trigger: What Works in Practice A Four-Step Playbook for Crypto Press Releases The Bottom Line The Attribution Problem Yes, there are isolated cases where a press release appears to generate inbound interest—but attribution in the wild is notoriously messy. A founder might claim ""the press release brought us new clients,"" when the actual driver was organic media pickup, community amplification, or word-of-mouth momentum that the release merely helped catalyze. The reality: Press releases rarely function as direct lead-gen triggers . Instead, they enable credibility so that other channels—founder-led content, strategic partnerships, community engagement—can convert more effectively. Why ""Image Tool"" Is the Right Framework Understanding press releases as image infrastructure rather than conversion machinery changes how you deploy them. Here's why this framing wins in crypto: 1. Record & Permanence A press release creates a citable, timestamped artifact accessible to journalists, partners, investors, and auditors. In a fast-moving, rumor-prone market, having proof you can point to is invaluable. This is defensible documentation, not speculative marketing. 2. Milestone Anchoring Pairing a release with major events—mainnet launch, exchange listing, security audit completion, institutional partnership—gives your narrative structure. Downstream coverage, analyst reports, and partner communications can all reference this anchor point, creating a coherent story arc. 3. Search Visibility & SEO Infrastructure Syndication across newswires supports backlink generation and organic discoverability. This is brand architecture work: building your domain authority, creating indexed pathways to your project, and establishing semantic relevance in search. It's not lead capture—it's long-term visibility infrastructure that compounds over time. 4. Stakeholder Signaling Institutions, exchanges, venture funds, and strategic partners interpret ""official press release"" as a signal of operational maturity and professionalism. Even if retail audiences scroll past, decision-makers at partners and investors often check for this formal communication layer before committing. By contrast, actual lead generation in crypto happens elsewhere: through high-signal founder threads, utility-driven long-form content, meaningful protocol integrations, exclusive media placements, and hands-on community programs. Press releases can support those motions , but they are not your primary lead engine. Image Tool vs. Lead-Gen Trigger: What Works in Practice Let's be specific about what press releases do well—and where they consistently underperform. As an Image Tool ✓ Press releases validate that an event occurred and signal operational legitimacy . This is the job they excel at: creating a formal record, establishing timestamp proof, and providing official language that partners, media, and analysts can cite confidently. As a Lead-Gen Trigger ✗ Effects are indirect, sporadic, and nearly impossible to attribute cleanly. Exclusive crypto media features, strategic co-marketing with complementary protocols, and founder-led educational content almost always outperform press releases for generating net-new business opportunities. As Brand Architecture ✓ Treat press releases as foundational components of your credibility stack. If leads emerge, consider them a bonus rather than the target metric. The real ROI is in citations, backlinks, partner confidence, and the ability to say ""as announced in our official press release"" in subsequent conversations. A Four-Step Playbook for Crypto Press Releases Here's how to integrate press releases strategically without overinvesting in them as a conversion channel: Step 1: Define the Job Clearly If you need a timestamped record, SEO support, or stakeholder proof-point, a press release fits the brief. If you need pipeline and immediate inbound, prioritize exclusive media coverage, partner co-marketing campaigns, AMAs with engaged communities, live demos, and founder narrative content instead. Step 2: Sequence Strategically Don't lead with the press release. Instead: Launch with a founder thread or detailed blog post → brief key reporters and partners directly → then issue the press release to cement the public record and feed search engines. This sequence maximizes both immediate engagement and long-term discoverability. Step 3: Measure the Right Metrics Track citations in media coverage, backlinks from reputable domains, partner and investor replies, and analyst mentions—not just traffic from the newswire. For leads, attribute conversions to the coverage and community touchpoints your press release helped unlock, not the release itself. Step 4: Maintain High Editorial Standards Every press release should include: Clear headline and subhead that communicate the news in plain language Hard facts and figures—no vague claims Direct links to audits, technical documentation, and GitHub repos Quotes with substantive content—not generic platitudes Crisp call-to-action—link to docs, demo environment, or testnet access Generic, jargon-heavy releases erode credibility rather than build it. If the release doesn't meet publication standards, don't issue it. The Bottom Line Press releases in crypto are credibility infrastructure, not a pipeline engine. Use them to anchor milestones, create citable records, support SEO foundations, and signal operational maturity—then rely on founder threads, exclusive media placements, partner co-marketing, and community programs to generate actual conversions. Treat any direct leads from a press release as a welcome bonus , not the primary KPI. Greenlight press releases only when the strategic job is clear: record-keeping, SEO visibility, stakeholder proof, or credibility signaling. Measure success through citations, quality backlinks, partner responses, and analyst pickup—not wire traffic or vanity metrics. Strategic clarity wins: Know what press releases can do, deploy them accordingly, and invest your real conversion budget where it belongs—in high-signal content, strategic relationships, and community engagement that drives measurable business outcomes.",More News,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-10-13 15:28:11

This has led to speculation about what the event could be and how it could impact the top meme coin. Dogecoin Influencer Hints At Big Things For DOGE In an X post , Top Doge stated that big things are on the horizon for Dogecoin on October 13. He added that Bit Origin is geared up to take the lead, suggesting that this may relate to institutional adoption. Bit Origin is one of the two DOGE treasury companies that have emerged in the U.S. The company currently holds 70.5 million DOGE on its balance sheet, according to CoinGecko data . Meanwhile, although the Dogecoin influencer didn’t provide any further information on what to expect, he declared that the DOGE journey is just getting started. In an earlier X post , the influencer stated that DOGE is no longer just a meme anymore. He further thanked companies like Bit Origin for turning internet hype into real-world value. Top Doge added that big money is paying attention to Dogecoin. The influencer’s statement about an October 13 development for the meme coin has also led to speculation about what it might be. It is worth noting that Top Doge isn’t the only one that has teased a major event for Dogecoin today. Media personality Mario Nawfal also said that something big is coming today that should shake up the Dogecoin community and the broader crypto community. House of Doge , the corporate arm of the Dogecoin Foundation, also reposted this X post from Nawfal, further indicating that the news was related to institutional adoption. House of Doge has notably played a key role in pushing DOGE’s institutional adoption, including helping set up CleanCore’s DOGE treasury. The DOGE ETFs The launch of the Dogecoin ETFs is major institutional news that the DOGE community is eagerly awaiting. However, that is unlikely to be the event that Top Doge and Mario Nawfal have teased about, as the SEC has put the approval of these funds on hold due to the U.S. government shutdown . The final deadline for a decision on Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF application was meant to come up on October 18. However, the commission plans to approve these funds under the new generic listing standards, rendering the timeline irrelevant. Now, the SEC can approve the S-1s at any time, although that is unlikely to happen until the shutdown ends. Polymarket data shows that the shutdown could last up to a month, further delaying the launch of the DOGE funds. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.2, up over 11% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Dogecoin|Bit Origin|CleanCore’s DOGE Treasury|CoinGecko|Coinmarketcap|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|Dogecoin Spot ETFs|dogeusd|dogeusdt|Grayscale’s Dogecoin ETF|House of Doge|Mario Nawfal|Polymarket|Top Doge|US SEC,EN,0,0,DOGE|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-13 15:30:31
53089618,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=835025,1760369491,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53089618.jpeg,China Renaissance plans $600M BNB fund in biggest institutional crypto bet yet,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/beijing-based-china-renaissance-to-invest-600-million-in-binances-bnb/,"Beijing-based investment bank China Renaissance Holdings Ltd. is preparing to raise $600 million for a new fund dedicated to investing in Binance’s cryptocurrency, BNB, according to people familiar with the matter. The fund would become the largest institutional commitment toward a single exchange-linked digital asset yet. China Renaissance, whose founder and former chairman, Bao Fan, was released from government detention in August after disappearing from public view for more than a year. Had disclosed plans to commit $100 million of its own capital toward BNB in an August filing. China Renaissance BNB treasury to be aided by YZi Labs The investment push is being coordinated in part with YZi Labs, the family office of Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, according to sources speaking to Bloomberg. Like Fan, Zhao was released from US federal custody last year following his plea deal with the Department of Justice. The former Binance CEO has continued exerting his “quiet” influence on the BNB ecosystem through YZi’s investment network. Under the arrangement, YZi Labs and China Renaissance are expected to co-invest $200 million into the digital asset fund. The remaining $400 million would be raised from private backers and institutional participants, the people said, requesting anonymity because the talks are not public. If completed, the raise would establish a publicly listed “digital-asset treasury company” in the United States to accumulate and manage BNB holdings as a primary treasury asset. The structure is similar to the business popularized by business intelligence firm Strategy, the Nasdaq-listed business intelligence firm that became a corporate Bitcoin holder under bullish CEO Michael Saylor. Strategy is the largest publicly-traded BTC accumulator with about 640,250 coins as of October 13, according to Coingecko. The China Renaissance initiative follows announcements by firms accumulating BNB as a long-term digital reserve. In July, CEA Industries Inc. and investment firm 10X Capital disclosed a $500 million fund dedicated to purchasing BNB, with participation from YZi Labs as well. Data compiled by CoinGecko shows that combined holdings from CEA Industries and Nano Labs have reached about 608,000 BNB, worth roughly $794.3 million based on current market prices. Corporate holders now control only about 0.44% of BNB’s circulating supply, but the number could keep growing as more companies try to mimic Strategy’s success through altcoins. In early October, Zhao’s family office hosted a private dinner dubbed the “BNB Visionary Circle: Igniting the Next Trillion” at the Shangri-La Hotel in Singapore. According to attendees familiar with the event, executives from China Renaissance and other BNB-focused entities were present to discuss expanding corporate holdings by adding BNB into their diversified portfolios. The closed-door gathering was hosted by Ella Zhang, the head of YZi Labs and a longtime Binance executive. BNB markets react positively to treasury news The BNB token, originally known as Binance Coin, was launched in 2017 through an initial coin to fund the creation of the Binance exchange. The ICO white paper allocated 80 million tokens, now worth more than $100 billion, to Binance’s founding team, which included Zhao. BNB was meant to reduce trading fees for Binance users, but has since become the backbone of the Binance Smart Chain, supporting decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, staking services, and smart contract applications. After the forgettable business week close that saw traders lose over $20 billion through liquidations, BNB is changing hands around $1,291. The token briefly touched an all-time high near $1,371 before correcting after holders commenced profit-taking. $BNB just swept buyside liquidity and rejected from the upper FVG Now it’s retesting the same zone around $1,290 – key area to watch If buyers hold, we could see another push toward $1,350–$1,400 Clean price action, liquidity doing its job pic.twitter.com/zpDlUqfYKQ — BlockchainBaller (@bl_ockchain) October 13, 2025 News of China Renaissance’s fundraising effort started a brief rally in BNB prices that pushed the token up about 5.7% in 24 hours. The token is up 120% year-to-date, and 15% over the week, following a post-ATH pullback. Analysts identify key support levels between $1,230 and $1,300, with resistance near $1,350–$1,400. Technical indicators show an expanding trading volume and an ascending channel structure. If BNB holds above $1,200, the broader uptrend would retest the $1,400 and $1,600 price levels in coming sessions.

In crypto—where market cycles accelerate rapidly and attention fragments across dozens of platforms—the what, who, and why behind your announcement determine whether a release resonates or vanishes into the noise. Which crypto press release formats actually generate measurable results? The straightforward answer: the ones that align announcement type with a specific audience and a trackable outcome. Below is a practical framework that maps event → audience → strategic outcome, so you can quickly assess whether a press release is worth the investment—and what success metrics should look like. Table of Contents 1. Product Announcements 2. Financial Announcements 3. Partnership & Integration Announcements 4. Regulatory & Infrastructure Announcements 5. Research & Analytical Announcements Choosing the Right Format: Press Release vs. Owned Content Quick Reference: Event → Audience → Impact What Actually Moves the Needle? 1. Product Announcements Typical examples: Token launches, protocol upgrades, feature rollouts, mainnet/testnet milestones, major version releases. Primary audience: Existing community, power users, developers, crypto-native media, technical analysts. Impact Profile Most resonance comes from people who already follow your project Breaks into wider circles if the release solves a pressing industry problem (e.g., dramatically reduced fees, novel security model, genuine UX breakthrough) Works best when paired with technical documentation , a founder thread on X, and a concise ""what's new / why it matters"" explainer Use a press release when: you need an official record for journalists/investors, require citations for future reference, or want SEO benefits Skip it when: the story is incremental; publish an owned post or thread first, then add a release if organic traction warrants KPIs to watch: On-chain usage lift, documentation visits, GitHub stars/PRs, waitlist signups, media/analyst citations, developer adoption metrics. Common pitfalls: Jargon-heavy copy that alienates even technical readers, missing demo links, generic executive quotes that add no substance. 2. Financial Announcements Typical examples: Fundraising rounds, venture backing, strategic investments, treasury disclosures, token unlock schedules. Primary audience: B2B partners, exchanges, market makers, institutional investors, sophisticated retail, industry analysts. Impact Profile Powerful credibility builder in crypto—especially when backed by named, reputable funds Can directly unlock business development conversations and integration opportunities Smaller raises still generate impact if framed around strategic narrative (team expertise, roadmap clarity, demonstrated traction) Use a press release when: you want third-party validation formally documented and discoverable through search Skip it when: details remain vague (undisclosed amounts or participants) or timing conflicts with major market events KPIs to watch: Inbound BD volume, partner response rates, analyst coverage pickup, qualified investor interest, exchange listing progression. Common pitfalls: Overclaiming impact, burying the lead (who invested, how much, strategic rationale), missing context on use of funds. 3. Partnership & Integration Announcements Typical examples: Exchange listings, wallet integrations, protocol collaborations, oracle/data feed partnerships, L2/L3 deployments, infrastructure alliances. Primary audience: Partner ecosystems, users at the integration touchpoint, developers seeking plug-and-play components. Impact Profile Often delivers the highest immediate growth potential because you inherit your partner's distribution network Performs exceptionally well with coordinated co-marketing (joint quotes, shared social calendars, cross-posted documentation) Use a press release when: you need mutual visibility and a durable, citable artifact that spans both ecosystems Skip it when: the integration is minor, experimental, or temporary—use a social thread plus documentation update instead KPIs to watch: New wallets/users from partner channels, integration adoption rates, referral traffic patterns, liquidity/TVL shifts, cross-protocol activity. Common pitfalls: Lack of partner amplification, weak ""why this matters now"" narrative, missing technical integration details. 4. Regulatory & Infrastructure Announcements Typical examples: Licenses obtained, audit/compliance milestones, SOC2/ISO certifications, participation in standards bodies, infrastructure hardening, security attestations. Primary audience: Regulators, enterprises, institutional investors, risk management teams, exchanges, legal/compliance departments. Impact Profile Low immediate excitement for retail; high trust signal for stakeholders controlling larger decisions Credibility compounds over time; facilitates exchange listings, enterprise contracts, and analyst briefings Use a press release when: you need a searchable trust signal and verifiable proof of compliance Skip it when: the milestone is purely internal or lacks third-party verification KPIs to watch: Enterprise RFP invitations, exchange listing progression, analyst briefings secured, security review pass-through rates, institutional onboarding. Common pitfalls: Vague claims without supporting documentation, missing audit report links, absent quotes from compliance officers or certifying partners. 5. Research & Analytical Announcements Typical examples: Industry reports, crypto user/market data, network analyses, security findings, performance benchmarks, ecosystem studies. Primary audience: Journalists, industry analysts, investment funds, fellow founders, policy researchers. Impact Profile Significantly underutilized but high-leverage: positions your team as a knowledge source, not just a subject Earns sustained coverage and inbound partnerships ; fuels thought leadership for quarters, not just days Use a press release when: you want editorial interest and quality backlinks to a data hub or comprehensive report Skip it when: methodology is thin, insights are common knowledge, or data lacks proper sourcing KPIs to watch: Media citations over time, backlinks to the report/data hub, analyst briefings secured, speaking engagement invitations, academic/research citations. Common pitfalls: Conclusions without transparent methodology, gated PDFs lacking executive summaries, absence of actionable insights or future implications. Choosing the Right Format: Press Release vs. Owned Content Before greenlighting a press release, ask these five diagnostic questions: Outcome clarity: What single job does this accomplish—creating a record, supporting SEO, increasing visibility, establishing proof, or enabling access? Audience specificity: Who actually needs this formal format—journalists, search algorithms, investors, institutional gatekeepers? Narrative strength: Is there a compelling ""why now"" beyond routine housekeeping? Partner amplification: Will someone else actively promote this (fund, exchange, integration partner, ecosystem)? Measurement plan: Which specific metric will demonstrate success? If you can't answer these questions clearly, publish a founder thread or blog post first, then revisit a formal release if organic traction materializes. Quick Reference: Event → Audience → Impact Product → community/developers → usage lift when solving genuine pain points Financial → B2B/institutional → credibility boost plus BD opportunities Partnership/Integration → partner user bases → fastest path to visible traction Regulatory/Infrastructure → enterprises/regulators → trust signals that compound Research/Analytics → media/analysts/funds → thought leadership and durable backlinks What Actually Moves the Needle? Do these crypto press release formats actually work? They do—when format matches audience and outcome. Here's what each type delivers best: Near-Term Visibility & Growth Partnership/Integration announcements lead here because they tap existing user bases and distribution networks immediately. Credibility & Business Development Leverage Financial announcements and Regulatory/Infrastructure announcements excel at opening doors with institutions, exchanges, and enterprise partners. Community Activation & Product Adoption Product announcements drive this outcome—but only when they address real, acknowledged pain points rather than incremental feature additions. Durable Authority & Sustained Inbound Research/Analytics announcements build long-term positioning as a thought leader, generating citations and partnerships long after publication. The Bottom Line Press releases generate results when the news type matches the right audience with clear outcomes and verifiable proof. If that alignment doesn't exist, publish it as owned content—and reserve your PR budget for announcements that genuinely compound over time. Strategic deployment matters more than frequency. One well-targeted partnership announcement with co-marketing outperforms three generic product updates. One substantive research report outweighs five routine milestone announcements. Know your objective, know your audience, measure what matters—and only use press releases when the format serves the strategy , not the other way around.",More News,EN,0,0,SPONSORED|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-10-13 15:34:15

Source: Smarter Web Company UK-listed Smarter Web Company Hunt for Distressed Bitcoin Holdings The company shows no signs of slowing down. In September, CryptoNews reported that the UK-listed company is considering acquisitions of struggling competitors to acquire their Bitcoin at discounted prices. Founder Andrew Webley told the Financial Times that the firm would “ certainly consider ” buying other companies for their Bitcoin at a discount, noting that some crypto treasury companies now trade below the value of their Bitcoin reserves. Webley acknowledged the sharp valuation swings, telling the publication that “ we probably got overvalued and now we’re almost certainly undervalued ,” while expressing concern for shareholders who have experienced the volatility. Despite the share price correction, the company briefly achieved a £1 billion market capitalization over the summer and has gained approximately 150% year-to-date, outperforming all but one company in the FTSE 350. Following a Proven Playbook The Smarter Web company is following a proven treasury strategy that has helped other public companies transform their financial narratives. In 2020, Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset in the US. Since then, other companies have followed, including Metaplanet in Japan and Capital B in France. Today, over 100 public companies hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset. When executed properly, this strategy has delivered strong results in major capital markets worldwide. According to Bitcoin Treasuries , Smarter Web Company now ranks 30th among the top 100 public BTC treasury companies, ahead of American Bitcoin Corp, Microcloud Hologram, and HIVE Digital Technologies. Within the UK, Smarter Web Company leads as the top Bitcoin treasury firm with over $200 million in Bitcoin reserves, followed by Satsuma Technology Plc with approximately 1,140 BTC worth around $130 million. David Bailey, CEO of Bitcoin Magazine, suggested that with Smarter Web Company’s continued Bitcoin acquisitions, they could emerge as the dominant Bitcoin treasury company in the UK.

Just three days ago, Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK’s biggest retail investment platform, urged investors to avoid cryptocurrencies despite regulators easing restrictions on crypto investment products. Hargreaves Lansdown said that “ Bitcoin is not an asset class, and we do not think cryptocurrency has characteristics that mean it should be included in portfolios for growth or income ,” adding that “ unlike other asset classes, it has no intrinsic value .” Hargreaves Lansdown warned retail investors against adding crypto to portfolios, calling Bitcoin “not an asset class.” #UK #Bitcoin https://t.co/9CWLjeHVrl — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 10, 2025 This cautious position comes days after the UK Financial Conduct Authority lifted its ban on crypto exchange-traded products for retail investors, although delays in prospectus approvals mean UK consumers had to wait until today before they can purchase Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked products. Despite its cautious stance, Hargreaves Lansdown said it plans to allow “ appropriate clients ” to trade crypto ETNs starting in early 2026, acknowledging that some traders will want speculative exposure to the market.

Fresh buying momentum has since restored confidence. Experts suggest that XRP’s technical outlook is positive, and weekly closes above $2.80 may open paths toward new highs. Technical Resistance Levels XRP has staged a sharp recovery of about 160% from Saturday’s low near $1, after the largest crypto liquidations on record erased almost $20 billion in leveraged positions. The broader market has stabilized, too, as seen with the surge of total capitalization back above $4 trillion after US-China trade tensions cooled. For XRP, this rebound was also possible due to recovering institutional confidence. In a statement to CryptoPotato , B2BINPAY analysts explained that exchange-traded crypto products (ETPs) saw nearly $6 billion in inflows earlier this month, including over $200 million into XRP-linked funds. This is a strong sign that professional investors are adding exposure following Ripple’s legal settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in August. From a technical perspective, B2BINPAY found that XRP’s immediate resistance is near $2.80-$3.00. As such, the analysts predicted that a weekly close above this range could target $3.40-$3.70. On the flipside, however, any slowdown might lead to consolidation between $2.50-$2.70 as leveraged positions reset. Broader macro factors, such as a softer dollar or easing trade tensions, could support further gains, though new shocks could obstruct positive momentum. “Still, the fact that XRP rebounded so quickly after a systemic flash crash means that its fundamental demand and investor base remain strong.” Zooming Out Short-term technical momentum now complements long-term bullish patterns. According to ChartNerd, XRP appears poised for higher levels after breaking out of a multi-year triangle pattern that began forming in 2018, with a clear breakout occurring in late 2023. Since then, the crypto asset has tracked a curved support path and has held at critical price levels. Using Fibonacci extensions (1.414 and 1.618), the analyst projects bold targets of $14 and $28. Additionally, a flag formation in 2024-2025 points to a brief consolidation before the next leg up. If XRP surpasses this flag, it could reach these higher targets between 2026 and 2028.

On October 12, U.S. President Trump reversed his previously harsh rhetoric on China. The conciliatory tone came just two days after his 100% tariff threat sent shockwaves through global markets, triggering a 13.7% Bitcoin crash on October 10. Trump’s pivot helped calm fears of a full-blown trade war. Equities stabilized — the S&P 500 rose 0.8% — and risk sentiment gradually improved. For Bitcoin, the shift reignited its narrative as a macro hedge: when geopolitical anxiety spikes, investors look to BTC for protection. ETF inflows, which had dipped amid the selloff, began to rebound as institutional confidence returned. The key question now is whether Bitcoin can maintain momentum. A sustained close above $116,100, a critical resistance level, would mark a confirmed reversal in trend. Technical Recovery: Mixed But Promising Source: coinmarketcap From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s rebound has been constructive, though not yet decisive. The price bounced off the $105,000 support — a key psychological and structural floor — and is now testing the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $114,600. The 14-day RSI climbed to 47.34, signaling a recovery from oversold conditions and a return to neutral momentum. However, technical indicators remain mixed. The MACD histogram sits at -764.53, showing that bearish pressure still lingers. Short-term traders have seized the opportunity to capitalize on the oversold bounce, but for a true shift in sentiment, Bitcoin must break through $116,100, which would open the door toward the 100-period SMA at $117,300. Failure to do so could see BTC retest $112,700 as buyers take profits. Why Crypto PR Matters Most in Heightened Volatility Like This? If PR has ever felt like trying to navigate a foggy road without headlights, Outset PR brings clarity with data. It builds strategies based on both retrospective and real-time metrics, which helps to obtain results with a long-lasting effect. Outset PR replaces vague promises with concrete plans tied to perfect publication timing, narratives that emphasize the product-market fit, and performance-based media selection.

Each campaign is calibrated to match the client’s specific goals, budget, and growth stage.

Outset PR’s secret weapon is its exclusive traffic acquisition tech and internal media analytics. Proprietary Tech That Powers Performance One of Outset PR’s most impactful tools is its in-house user acquisition system.

Case in point: The careful selection of media outlets has helped Outset PR increase user engagement for Step App in the US and UK markets. Outset PR Engineers Visibility That Fits the Market One of the biggest pain points in Web3 PR is the disconnect between effort and outcome: generic messaging, no product-market alignment, and media hits that generate visibility but leave business impact undefined. Outset PR addresses this by offering customized solutions. Every campaign begins with a thorough research and follows a clearly mapped path from spend to the result. It's data-backed and insight-driven with just the right level of boutique care. BTC Outlook: Cautious Optimism Ahead Bitcoin’s rebound reflects a confluence of factors — easing geopolitical risk, opportunistic technical buying, and renewed institutional interest. While these elements support a bullish near-term trajectory, the resistance at $116,100 remains a key inflection point. Additionally, open interest jumped 15% in the past 24 hours, suggesting increased leverage. Such conditions often amplify volatility in both directions. If BTC can hold above $114,600 (the 38.2% Fibonacci) and convert resistance into support, a stronger recovery could unfold. Otherwise, profit-taking could push the price back toward $112,700 or lower. Bottom line Bitcoin’s fundamentals remain intact, and the macro backdrop has turned less hostile. However, until the market confirms a breakout above $116,100, the recovery remains tentative — a balancing act between optimism and caution. Outset PR translates Web3 project momentum into measurable results by blending technical insight with media precision.

The agreement means OpenAI will design its own processors while Broadcom handles development and manufacturing. The chips will embed OpenAI’s own model-training experience “directly into the hardware,” aiming to improve performance and efficiency across its infrastructure. The new systems will be built into server racks and rolled out gradually through OpenAI’s own facilities and those run by its cloud-computing partners. “By designing its own chips and systems, OpenAI can embed what it’s learned from developing frontier models and products directly into the hardware, unlocking new levels of capability and intelligence,” Broadcom said in the press release. Right after OpenAI and Broadcom announced the partnership, the latter’s market value instantly surged, as its stock rallied by more than 12%, per data from Google Finance. The company, which produces components used in iPhones, networking gear, and data infrastructure, has become one of the biggest winners from the ongoing AI spending surge. Broadcom (AVGO) stock is now up 40% in 2025, beating the 29% gain of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. OpenAI says it aims for flexibility with Broadcom’s networking tech CEO Hock Tan, who first hinted at the partnership during an earnings call last month, confirmed the collaboration through Monday’s announcement. He did not specify the contract’s value but said the deal would help accelerate Broadcom’s work on custom AI hardware. Analysts had speculated that OpenAI was the mysterious $10 billion customer Tan mentioned during the September earnings call, but that turned out to be incorrect. Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s semiconductor division, appeared on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” alongside OpenAI President Greg Brockman to discuss the details. Kawwas clarified that OpenAI wasn’t the company behind the $10 billion order, joking that he’d “love to take a $10 billion [purchase order] from my good friend Greg,” but hadn’t received it yet. While Broadcom will provide the chips and networking systems, it won’t be the one building or operating data centers. Instead, it will install custom server racks built with OpenAI’s designs inside facilities owned either by OpenAI or by its cloud partners. The full deployment of these 10 gigawatts of compute power, roughly the equivalent of several large-scale hyperscale campuses, is expected to finish before 2030. Both companies see this as part of a long-term infrastructure strategy. The order increased Broadcom’s forecast for AI revenue next year, when shipments will begin, Tan said during the call. OpenAI and Broadcom have been working together for the last 18 months, and they will begin deploying racks of custom-designed chips starting late next year, the companies said Monday.

Bitcoin spadł poniżej 110 000 dolarów, a Ethereum w ciągu kilku godzin straciło ponad 20% wartości. Automatyczne systemy handlowe i cienka płynność podczas weekendu tylko pogłębiły wyprzedaż. Na platformach takich jak Binance, OKX czy Bybit doszło do lawinowych likwidacji pozycji lewarowanych. Według danych rynkowych, w ciągu zaledwie 24 godzin zlikwidowano ponad 1,6 miliona pozycji, a łączna wartość strat przekroczyła 19,3 miliarda dolarów . Niektóre szacunki mówią nawet o 30 miliardach dolarów, ponieważ część giełd raportuje maksymalnie jedno zdarzenie likwidacji na sekundę. Indeks strachu i chciwości zanurkował z poziomu 64, oznaczającego chciwość, do zaledwie 27, wskazującego na strach. Skala paniki przypominała krach z maja 2021 roku, kiedy to nadmierne lewarowanie również doprowadziło do łańcucha wymuszonych sprzedaży i gwałtownego tąpnięcia na całym rynku. Obawy o globalny wzrost i przyszłość kryptowalut Według analityków, ostatnie wydarzenia obnażyły dobrze znane słabości rynku kryptowalut. Przede wszystkim zbyt wysoki poziom dźwigni, ograniczoną płynność poza godzinami szczytu i automatyczne systemy sprzedaży reagujące łańcuchowo na spadki cen. Greg Magadini, dyrektor ds. instrumentów pochodnych w firmie Amberdata, stwierdził, że kluczowe pytanie dotyczy teraz reakcji Chin. Jak powiedział: Ryzyko nie polega na samych cłach, lecz na tym, czy Chiny odpowiedzą agresywnymi działaniami odwetowymi. Dodał również: Pełnowymiarowa wojna handlowa pomiędzy dwiema największymi gospodarkami świata mogłaby poważnie spowolnić globalny wzrost. Magadini zauważył też, że wielu inwestorów zaczyna szukać bezpieczniejszych przystani – od obligacji skarbowych po stablecoiny. Kryptowaluty są pod presją, a ucieczka kapitału do obligacji USA odzwierciedla realne obawy o tempo globalnego ożywienia. Na razie jednak uspokajający ton Trumpa wydaje się działać. Rynek kryptowalut złapał oddech, a inwestorzy odzyskali nieco pewności. Nowe kierunki i rosnąca rola projektów społecznościowych W czasie, gdy duże kryptowaluty walczą o stabilność, coraz więcej uwagi przyciągają mniejsze projekty. Wśród nich wyróżniają się nowe memecoiny , które łączą humor, marketing i społeczność z mechanizmami umożliwiającymi realne zyski. Jednym z projektów, który w ostatnich tygodniach zdobył szczególną popularność, jest Maxi Doge – świeży memecoin oparty na blockchainie Ethereum. Jego twórcy zbudowali wokół niego silny, pozytywny przekaz inspirowany kulturą siłowni i motywacją do rozwoju. Maskotką projektu jest muskularny pies rasy Shiba Inu. Projekt umożliwia staking już w trakcie trwającej przedsprzedaży kryptowalut , co oznacza, że inwestorzy mogą generować pasywne zyski jeszcze przed oficjalnym debiutem tokena na giełdach. Przejrzysta tokenomika i społecznościowy charakter Ogromnym plusem jest fakt, że Maxi Doge stawia na transparentność. Cała dystrybucja tokenów odbywa się publicznie, bez udziału dużych funduszy venture capital. Dzięki temu rynek nie jest narażony na gwałtowne spadki cen po premierze , które często wynikają z wyprzedaży przez tzw. kryptowalutowych wielorybów . Ponad połowa puli tokenów przeznaczona jest na przedsprzedaż, 20% trafi na działania marketingowe i współprace z influencerami. Pozostała część zostanie wykorzystana na fundusz społecznościowy, staking oraz zapewnienie płynności na giełdach. Projekt stał się prawdziwym viralem na platformach takich jak X, Reddit i Discord, osiągając sporą popularność. Internet zalała fala memów, haseł motywacyjnych i żartobliwych grafik z muskularnym Shibą. Wzrost zainteresowania przed debiutem na giełdach Wczesne etapy przedsprzedaży przyciągnęły tysiące uczestników . Mechanizm rosnącej ceny tokena na każdym kolejnym etapie zachęca inwestorów do wcześniejszego zakupu. Obecnie $MAXI kosztuje mniej niż centa, co czyni go przystępnym nawet dla osób zaczynających swoją przygodę z rynkiem krypto. Projekt zapewnia wyjątkowo wysokie roczne zyski poprzez staking. W pierwszych tygodniach sięgnęły nawet kilku tysięcy procent. Całość działa na audytowanym smart kontrakcie Ethereum, co zwiększa bezpieczeństwo i wiarygodność projektu. Analitycy i społeczność krypto zaczynają coraz częściej przyglądać się prognozom Maxi Doge . Choć jest to typowy memecoin, jego spójny branding, uczciwa dystrybucja i silna społeczność mogą sprawić, że projekt nie będzie tylko chwilową sensacją, ale trwałym graczem w świecie kryptowalut. Maxi Doge w szerszym kontekście rynku W okresie, gdy rynek staje się coraz bardziej wrażliwy na decyzje polityczne, projekty takie jak Maxi Doge pokazują, że siła społeczności i kreatywnego marketingu może być równie ważna jak makroekonomiczne czynniki . Dla inwestorów, którzy szukają świeżych możliwości, ale nie chcą ryzykować w dużych, niestabilnych projektach, Maxi Doge może stanowić ciekawą alternatywę. Łączy luz i humor memecoinów z przejrzystą strukturą ekonomiczną i realnym potencjałem wzrostu. Co dalej czeka rynek krypto? Po weekendowych turbulencjach rynek kryptowalut odzyskał równowagę, a słowa Donalda Trumpa o chęci współpracy z Chinami pomogły przywrócić wiarę w stabilność . Choć ryzyko globalnej wojny handlowej wciąż wisi w powietrzu, inwestorzy z ulgą obserwują odbicie głównych aktywów cyfrowych. W czasach niepewności i dynamicznych zmian, warto szukać innowacyjnych projektów z niższym progiem wejścia. Jeśli obecne tempo rozwoju się utrzyma, Maxi Doge może wkrótce stać się jednym z symboli nowej fali społecznościowych kryptowalut.",Crypto News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|ETH|SHIB|BNB|BTC,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-13 15:45:05

The rally was fueled by a surge in the Coinbase Premium Gap, which spiked to +6.0 on October 10, signaling strong buying interest among U.S. investors. At the same time, on-chain data showed exchange outflows totaling around 51K ETH, indicating that large holders, or “whales,” were moving their coins off exchanges — a classic sign of accumulation. This combination of premium-driven demand and shrinking exchange supply helped stabilize Ethereum above the $4,000 threshold. Historically, sustained Coinbase premiums have often preceded broader institutional inflows into U.S.-based ETFs and custody products. Technical Picture: Recovery, But Still Cautious Source: coinmarketcap From a technical standpoint, Ethereum’s momentum has improved but remains fragile. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) rose to 46.85, pulling out of oversold territory but still far from signaling bullish strength. Similarly, the MACD reading of -56.85 reflects neutral-to-bearish conditions, suggesting that the market’s recent bounce is more of a technical recovery than a confirmed trend reversal. For bulls, the key level to watch is $4,455, aligning with the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement. A decisive close above this level would confirm a shift in market structure and potentially open a path toward $4,600–$4,800 in the short term. Failure to break through could invite renewed selling pressure, particularly if macro sentiment turns risk-off again. How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter? Discover how targeted campaigns deliver verifiable results. 👉 Reach out to Outset PR Outlook: Spot Flows in Control, But Watch the SEC Ethereum’s recovery above $4,000 is built on organic spot demand, not excessive leverage. Still, with open interest up 8.2% in the past 24 hours, traders are gradually rebuilding positions, which could magnify volatility. The balance between ETF optimism and regulatory uncertainty will dictate Ethereum’s next move. The key watch level is clear: can ETH maintain $4,000 support if the SEC postpones ETF approvals? Monitoring SEC staffing updates and net ETF inflows will provide early clues about whether the current momentum can evolve into a sustained uptrend. Bottom Line Ethereum’s rebound showcases renewed confidence driven by whale accumulation, U.S. buying pressure, and early signs of a technical recovery. While a breakout above $4,455 would confirm bullish reversal, lingering regulatory risks and cautious momentum suggest the rally still needs stronger confirmation before turning into a sustained bull run.

As the market steadies, investor focus shifts to emergent coins poised for significant gains. This article delves into the key tokens to watch, sparking curiosity about potential market movers. BNB Price Surge Hints at Growth Potential Source: tradingview BNB is showing impressive momentum within a price range between a thousand and a half thousand dollars, with nearly nine percent growth in the past week. The coin may aim higher as its current price is slightly below its simple 10-day moving average of around thirteen hundred dollars. If BNB continues its climb, it could challenge its nearest resistance level at just under seventeen hundred dollars, a potential gain of over ten percent. Looking further, the next target is the two-thousand-dollar mark, suggesting a robust growth potential of over forty percent. With a Relative Strength Index near 47, BNB still has room to push higher without hitting the overbought territory. Conclusion BNB reached an all-time high as the Binance network grew stronger. This rise occurs as the market becomes more stable. Other coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano also show steady performance. Solana and Polkadot are gaining attention, contributing to overall market confidence. The strength of major coins supports the growth of smaller projects. This balanced environment sets a positive tone for future developments in the crypto space. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The unusual late-stage airdrop aims to reward the support for meme markets. BNB Chain and Four.meme announced a new airdrop for ecosystem partners. A total of $45M BNB tokens will be distributed as a reward for engaging with the meme ecosystem. Following the recent market turbulence in the Binance ecosystem, market participants remained active. For that reason, BNB Chain, along with Four.meme, PancakeSwap, Trust Wallet, and Binance Wallet will airdrop $45M across the Binance ecosystem to wallets that interacted with memes. A total of 160K addresses have been identified as eligible, and the first airdrops will start in the coming days. The airdrop will go to other participants as well, but will reserve a large share for meme traders last active in early October. ‘ This initiative represents a collective effort across the BNB ecosystem to show appreciation for our users and builders, especially the memecoin community. The memecoin community is one of the most active and creative communities in the ecosystem, which has been affected the most by recent events, especially during the past week, ’ announced BNB Chain. BNB Chain expects to complete the program in early November. The airdrop arrived just hours after BNB hit a new all-time peak at $1,357, as reported by Cryptopolitan. The Reload Airdrop, as the program will be called, expects to repair some of the turbulence after Binance’s liquidations over the weekend. BNB Chain memes surpass Solana The BNB airdrop to retail traders invited comparisons with Pump.fun, which only rewarded creators, but not traders in the trenches. BNB Chain recently surpassed Solana’s meme activity based on daily fees, and used the opportunity to boost the community. The airdrop is expected to return to the meme ecosystem, serving as additional liquidity. The expectation is for the funds to boost leading memes like 4, as well as ASTER and CAKE. The airdrop arrived after weeks of competition between Solana and BNB memes, with some seeing a deliberate opposition. Still, Binance’s ecosystem is trying to boost its position, especially after the series of BNB records. Liquidity flows into the BNB ecosystem The BNB ecosystem is making a V-shaped recovery, just a day after altcoins lost up to 90% of their value. Both Binance and BNB Chain see an inflow of stablecoins, potentially affecting the market in the coming days. The Binance ecosystem expects a rapid recovery, as the exchange carries record stablecoin liquidity. | Source: Cryptoquant Binance immediately recovered its liquidity, with USD exchange reserves at an all-time peak, and near-record open interest. One of the sources of liquidity was USDT on TRON , which moved into exchanges in the past few days. BNB Chain was also the top chain in terms of fees for the past day, based on Artemis data . The chain easily surpassed even Hyperliquid, Ethereum, and Solana. In the past week, BNB Chain saw net inflows of $6.8M, with most deposits coming from Ethereum, Solana, and Arbitrum.

October 2025 Crypto Watchlist, Metrics, and Risk Management The search for the next altcoin to explode is always at the front of investors’ minds. With thousands of projects launching each year, finding the few that stand out requires more than guesswork. This October, the market shows signs of rotation, as established alt coins to buy like ethereum and shiba inu hold their ground while new meme coin project launches create fresh attention. The question many ask is how to find crypto coins before they explode without falling for hype. The answer lies in a mix of solid metrics, community activity, and calculated risk management. How to Find Crypto Coins Before They Explode Using Key Metrics One of the biggest challenges investors face is knowing how to find crypto coins before they explode. The noise in the market is overwhelming, with countless claims of the next altcoin to explode or the best cryptocurrency to buy cheap. To cut through, smart investors focus on measurable signals. Community engagement is one of the strongest indicators. A meme coin project with a fast-growing, active following often builds momentum that can turn into sustained interest. Transaction volume and liquidity also serve as markers. Cheap crypto coins to invest in for high return still need healthy trading activity to avoid volatility traps. Risk management plays an equally important role. Diversifying across alt coins to buy helps balance exposure. Allocating small amounts to best web3 crypto projects while maintaining positions in more established assets allows investors to capture upside while reducing downside. Tracking development activity and transparency from teams can reveal whether a project is simply trend-driven or genuinely building. Looking at these metrics together creates a clearer picture, allowing investors to sort between hype and long-term potential. Based Eggman Presale Momentum and Unique Use Cases Among the latest meme coin project launches, Based Eggman has quickly caught attention. With a $256K presale raise already secured, it highlights how targeted community building and creative branding can turn into early traction. The project sits in presale stage 2, offering a 30% bonus through its GGS-30 code, showing signs of strong participation even in a cautious market. What sets Based Eggman apart is its real-world tie-ins and entertainment value. Instead of relying only on speculation, the project incorporates streaming and cultural relevance into its ecosystem. This strategy allows it to function as more than just another cheap crypto coin to invest in for high return. It blends digital finance with entertainment, giving users a chance to engage in multiple ways. The project is also designed with a focus on community-first growth. Strong participation from holders creates a network effect, where engagement feeds visibility. For those learning how to find crypto coins before they explode, Based Eggman shows the importance of culture, timing, and execution working together.

Each has its own angle, yet all highlight how varied the next altcoin to explode could be. BlockDAG is drawing attention with its technical approach. By improving scalability and security through directed acyclic graph structures, it aligns with those seeking the best web3 crypto projects. Its ability to handle volume efficiently positions it as more than just the best cheap cryptocurrency to invest in. LayerBrett, on the other hand, leans into the presale market. It has positioned itself as one of the top crypto presales in 2025, gathering early supporters who value first-mover benefits. Its growing whitelist and transparent roadmap make it part of the conversation around cheap crypto coins to invest in for high return. Based Eggman adds cultural and entertainment-driven utility into the mix. With DeFi functions and streaming integration inside its $GGs ecosystem, it connects directly with today’s online culture. Together, these three show how varied opportunities are for anyone exploring the best cryptocurrency to buy cheap in a shifting market. Conclusion: Finding the Next Altcoin to Explode With Clarity The October 2025 crypto landscape reminds investors that no single signal can answer how to find crypto coins before they explode. Instead, it is about blending metrics, culture, and risk management into a broader strategy. cheap crypto coins to invest in for high return can deliver results, but they require careful evaluation of development, transparency, and liquidity. From BlockDAG’s technical focus to LayerBrett’s presale traction and Based Eggman’s cultural reach, the options for alt coins to buy are diverse. Each carries potential upside alongside risks. By staying disciplined and learning from both established assets and new meme coin project launches, investors can prepare for the next altcoin to explode. Stay alert, research deeply, and explore projects early. Now is the time to build your October watchlist before the market decides its next breakout.

BLOX combines crypto-related equities, regulated Bitcoin/Ether ETFs, and systematic options to monetize volatility and deliver an annualized yield near 9%. The ETF provides a unique way to benefit from crypto's growth and volatility without direct custody, appealing to yield-seeking investors amid rising institutional adoption. BLOX carries high volatility and regulatory risks, but for those accepting these trade-offs, it offers a novel approach to income from digital assets. Digital assets aren’t going away.. Cryptocurrencies are maturing beyond a phase of speculation to become an institutional-grade asset just as investors everywhere search for new sources of yield. That convergence—growth meeting income—is rare. And if you see opportunity in that dynamic, then the Nicholas Crypto Income ETF ( BLOX ) might deserve a closer look. A New Kind of Crypto Exposure BLOX launched in mid-2025. It’s actively managed and intended to provide investors with ongoing income through exposure to a range of crypto-linked assets. Instead of simply owning digital coins, the fund is broken down into three parts — crypto-related equities; Bitcoin and Ether exchange-traded funds; and a systematic options overlay that sells calls and puts to capture risk premiums. nicholasx.com/blox/ In the real world BLOX looks like a hybrid equity fund, a crypto tracker and covered-call strategy. Part of the equity sleeve lists names like Coinbase, Riot Platforms, Marathon Digital, Robinhood and Galaxy Digital and chipmakers such as NVIDIA and TSMC that contribute to the computing backbone for mining and blockchain infrastructure. Its crypto exposure comes from holdings such as the VanEck Bitcoin ETF, Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, and iShares Ethereum Trust, providing the portfolio with direct sensitivity to Bitcoin and Ether prices without custody risk. About a third of assets are resting in those regulated funds, and cash balances remain to back up collateral for the options strategy. Monetizing Volatility for Weekly Income stockcharts.com The difference between BLOX and most other funds is its source of yield. This ETF pays dividends weekly. Those payments largely come from option premiums rather than traditional dividends. Payouts have averaged to the tune of $0.15-$0.18 per share per week since inception, which would lead to about a 9% annualized yield. nicholasx.com/blox/ In practice then, BLOX turns crypto’s volatility into cash flow — paying investors for the market’s inherent instability instead of simply leaving them at its mercy. The fund is also structured to provide some protection against moderate declines, as option income can counteract a portion of the decline in asset prices. The Bigger Picture: Crypto Meets Income Investing BLOX’s introduction also arrives as digital assets earn regulatory approval and institutional support. The era of the Bitcoin ETF, tokenization projects and further blockchain infrastructure spending. In the meantime, the hunger for yield amid interest-rate normalization remains strong. BLOX is placed between these two, providing exposure to the potential upside of crypto while also catering to yield-hungry investors. This strategy—monetizing volatility via options—is one already used in equity markets but now applied to crypto’s special kind of volatility. Moreover if adoption of blockchain continues to grow and tokenisation becomes part of the global financial system, then the companies and assets in BLOX could do very well. The ETF effectively allows conventional investors to participate in that evolution without having to bother with the complexities of wallets, staking or decentralized platforms. Risks and Considerations Innovation always carries uncertainty. BLOX’s holdings can be some of the most volatile in the public markets and steep drawdowns in Bitcoin or Ethereum could quickly put pressure on their NAV. The options overlay—which provides income but can cap upside when the market is running and also exposes the fund to potential losses if markets move too bondlike or violently—is a big differentiator. There is also the regulatory risk: tougher crypto oversight or unfavorable rulings against exchanges could impact the portfolio. And because it’s such a young strategy, there’s little proof for investors of how the approach performs over a full crypto cycle. BLOX isn’t a conservative income fund — it’s a highly aggressive income experiment, designed to see if crypto’s volatility can be turned into a feature rather than just one of its many bugs. For investors willing to accept that trade-off, it has something new to offer: the chance to collect yield from the same forces that drive crypto’s price swings. Conclusion The Nicholas Crypto Income ETF captures a sweet spot in themes: digital-asset adoption and income generation.

53090657,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=834673,1760371200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53090657.jpeg,Shiba Inu (SHIB) vs Mutuum Finance (MUTM): Which is the Best Crypto to Buy Under $1 That Could Overtake Dogecoin?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/shiba-inu-shib-vs-mutuum-finance-mutm-which-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-under-1-that-could-overtake-dogecoin/,"The fight to become the next big crypto is gaining momentum, and investors are asking which coin under $1 has a realistic chance to usurp Dogecoin (DOGE) in market rankings? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has been a long-time favorite, based on community sentiment, and a history of surprising comebacks. However, the market is maturing, and astute investors are looking beyond hype tokens to tokens that bring real innovation and growth to the table. Enter Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Now in Phase 6 of its presale and having sold out over 65%, MUTM brings together DeFi innovation and strong presale form, a structured, community-led roadmap that places it in a position to compete, and potentially outstrip, the old-school meme coins. With the presale advancing fast and its token set to enable both utility and growth, Mutuum Finance will certainly overthrow DOGE. Shiba Inu (SHIB): Is It the Meme Coin to Put Money On Anymore? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has long been a retail investor darling, and it still seems to be holding steady, ranging near $0.000012, which could indicate a potential jump back to key resistance and the 200-day EMA. Volumes have come off slightly, but increasing ETF speculation and increasing institutional demand are a green light and indicate that SHIB may be in line for a shot of new strength. Analysts projecting a breakout to $0.000015 anticipate a run to $0.000021, particularly if buying momentum increases. But as enticing as these levels are, the real question, for investors looking for under-$1 cryptos that have real breakout potential, remains, is Shiba Inu the best coin or perhaps there’s another participant building stealthy momentum waiting in the wings? Dominance of Mutuum Finance During Q4 The presale of Mutuum Finance has already reached Phase 6, having collectively generated more than $17.25 million and recording a total of 16,910 investors. It has been a display of increasing confidence in the direction of the project and makes Mutuum Finance a highly viable ecosystem for investors aiming for sustainable return and long-term gain. The protocol further contains an active Loan-to-Value (LTV) mechanism and liquidation process that react to price shock automatically to set firmness in the wake of fluctuations. Reserve multipliers between 10% and 35%, which are adjusted based on collateral risk profiles, contain yet another level of surety, thus making the platform firmer as well. MUTM also has a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program whose vulnerability classification consists of four levels, that is, critical, the major, the minor, and the low. This is enhanced further by the open architecture design of the platform coupled with security-by-design, rendering the DeFi protocol secure, stable, and robust to the users. Mutuum Finance Borrowing & Lending Protocol Next up for the platform is the release of the revolutionary lending and borrowing protocol . Version 1 (V1) of the protocol will be launched on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, and it will have key functionalities to include the liquidities pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. Day-one support to borrow, lend, and collateralize the ETH and USDT will be there and the users will be able to have an open-ended, scalable, and efficient DeFi experience. Mutuum Finance Emerges the Winner Whereas Shiba Inu (SHIB) stabilizes around $0.000012 with upside to $0.000021, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a viable alternative to investors in search of utility-driven growth below $1. With Phase 6 of MUTM’s presale having grossed more than $17.25 million from over 16,910 investors, with tokens sold already making up 65% of tokens, its upcoming Sepolia Testnet’s lending and borrowing protocol, including liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, liquidator bot, plus sound risk management, and a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, makes the platform secure and scalable. Investors targeting long-term growth and potential market leadership need to quickly acquire MUTM tokens prior to the presale’s progression.

For XRP , one of the most closely watched digital assets, these cycles have often defined its story. Now, many traders are asking whether the latest pullback could be the calm before another explosive move, reminiscent of a famous chapter in XRP’s past. A Familiar Pattern Resurfaces In early 2017, XRP plunged nearly 60% in a matter of weeks — only to skyrocket shortly after, recording one of the most dramatic rallies in crypto history. Fast forward to October 2025, and a similar pattern appears to be taking shape. XRP recently dipped about 50% from its local high, sparking fresh debate across the crypto community about whether history might be setting the stage for another surge. Crypto analyst Stephanie Starr reignited this discussion in a recent post on X, noting that “history may not repeat, but it can rhyme.” Her remark quickly caught the attention of traders and market observers, who began comparing current XRP charts to the 2017 setup. History may not repeat, but it can rhyme…. Jan 2017- XRP dipped almost 60% before blasting off 5 weeks later. Oct 2025 It dipped 50% …. Are we approaching the final weeks before pic.twitter.com/LkaTpjQEKz — Stephanie Starr (@StephanieStarrC) October 12, 2025 Many believe the similarities — from market structure to investor sentiment — could point toward an approaching bullish reversal. On-Chain Strength Amid Volatility Despite the price correction, XRP’s on-chain data tells a resilient story. Transaction volumes and network activity have remained stable, with occasional spikes during periods of intense volatility. This indicates that, while short-term traders may have taken profits or exited positions, long-term holders continue to accumulate — a behavior often seen before significant upward moves. Data from blockchain monitoring platforms also show increased holdings among major XRP wallets, signaling renewed accumulation by institutional or high-net-worth investors. This confidence reflects belief in XRP’s continued role in Ripple’s global payments ecosystem , which facilitates real-time cross-border transactions for financial institutions worldwide. A Supportive Macro and Regulatory Backdrop The broader macro environment is also providing a tailwind. Easing inflation, improving global liquidity, and a resurgence of risk appetite among investors have lifted sentiment across digital assets. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s ongoing expansion into Europe, the Middle East, and Asia — regions increasingly embracing blockchain-based financial infrastructure — further strengthens the utility narrative behind XRP. Equally important is the regulatory clarity that followed the conclusion of Ripple’s long-standing case with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission earlier in August. With both sides withdrawing their appeals, the legal uncertainty surrounding XRP has largely dissipated. This resolution has encouraged greater confidence among institutional participants and may help sustain upward momentum if market demand continues to build. History’s Echo or Investor Hope? While 2017 offers an intriguing parallel, the crypto landscape of 2025 is vastly different. Institutional participation, liquidity depth, and regulatory frameworks have matured significantly. As such, even if XRP’s market behavior “rhymes” with the past, it will likely play out on a different scale and timeline. Still, Stephanie Starr’s point remains compelling. History may not repeat itself exactly — but if it rhymes once more, XRP’s latest dip could mark the final act before a renewed wave of bullish momentum. As of report time, XRP trades at $2.58, according to live data from CoinMarketCap . Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The focus narrows on three undervalued coins, each trading for less than $1. These digital assets have the potential to soar with the anticipated retail frenzy. This article uncovers which specific coins are poised for significant growth, drawing investor interest. Hedera (HBAR) Shows Mixed Signals with Recent Price Dip Source: tradingview Hedera's price sits between roughly $0.10 and $0.25, recently slipping by over 13% in a week and about 24% in a month. Despite this, the coin has grown nearly 20% in the past six months. It now faces a challenge to breach the nearest resistance level of $0.32, which could mean a rise of over 25% from its current highest point if it manages to break through. The support around $0.014 gives some safety net, but investors are keen to see if Hedera can rally back and surpass its recent hurdles, especially with the Relative Strength Index showing room for upward movement. Pepe Crypto in Focus: Price Movement and Growth Prospects Source: tradingview Pepe (PEPE) is trading between $0.0000034 and $0.0000109. It's a volatile ride with a recent drop of over 21% in a week and down by a third this month. Yet, there's room for hope. The RSI at 61.49 and Stochastic at 75.70 show it's not overbought. If it breaks the nearest resistance at $0.0000144, it could leap toward the next level at $0.000022. Such a move might push it up by nearly 100%. With a 10-day average of $0.0000076 trailing close behind prices, PEPE could possibly gear up for a short-term rebound. Keep an eye on market trends to gauge its dynamics. Algorand Struggles but Holds Promise Above $0.13 Source: tradingview Algorand's current price hovers between thirteen and twenty-five cents. Recent trends show a dip, with a six-month gain of nearly fourteen percent still intact. The coin struggles to overcome the nearest resistance at thirty cents but stays above the key support at just under six cents. If the price breaks the thirty-cent barrier, it could rise to forty-three cents, marking a potential increase of over seventy percent from its lower range. However, recent week and month performances show declines of almost seven and eighteen percent, respectively. The Relative Strength Index and other indicators suggest a neutral stance, indicating Algorand's potential for growth if favorable market conditions return. Conclusion HBAR, PEPE, and ALGO have shown potential for significant growth by the end of 2025. An increase in retail interest might drive these coins up to 10 times their current value. These coins offer unique features and strong communities, setting them apart in the market. Observing their development and the increasing attention could lead to substantial returns.

53090536,605253,1760371641,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53090536.jpeg,Bitcoin News: Trump löst heftigsten Abverkauf aller Zeiten aus – nun Erholung,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-trump-zoll-china-markt-erholung/,"Trumps Ankündigung, Waren aus China mit 100% Zöllen zu belegen, brachte Finanzmärkte weltweit sowie Bitcoin und Co. tief in den roten Bereich Innerhalb weniger Stunden verlor der Markt Milliardenbeträge. Mittlerweile haben sich BTC, ETH und andere Altcoins zu großen Teilen wieder erholt Der Freitag begann ruhig – und endete im Chaos. Bitcoin, Ethereum und viele andere Kryptowährungen stürzten plötzlich ab. In nur wenigen Stunden verloren Anleger Milliarden. Grund dafür war eine politische Entscheidung, die auch die Börsen in den USA und China erschütterte. Doch schon am Wochenende deutete sich eine schnelle Erholung an. Bitcoin fällt in wenigen Stunden stark ab Am Freitagmorgen lag der Bitcoin-Kurs noch bei rund 121.000 Dollar. Doch im Laufe des Tages setzte ein rasanter Absturz ein. Innerhalb von sieben Stunden sank der Kurs auf 109.000 Dollar. Damit waren alle Gewinne der vorherigen Woche wieder verloren. Ethereum fiel auf 3.686 Dollar, Solana lag nur noch knapp über 173 Dollar. Die Stimmung an den Märkten kippte schlagartig. Auch die großen Aktienindizes bekamen den Schock zu spüren. Der Nasdaq fiel um 3,6 Prozent, der S&P 500 verlor 2,7 Prozent und der Dow Jones rutschte um 1,9 Prozent ab. Die Verbindung zwischen Kryptomarkt und Aktienmarkt zeigte sich einmal mehr deutlich. Investoren verkauften ihre riskanteren Anlagen aus Angst vor weiteren Verlusten. Rekord-Liquidationen sorgen für Panik Als die Kurse plötzlich fielen, begannen viele Handelsplattformen automatisch Positionen zu schließen. In nur einer Stunde wurden fast sieben Milliarden Dollar an Krypto-Positionen aufgelöst. Die meisten Verluste trafen Anleger, die auf steigende Kurse gesetzt hatten. Insgesamt wurden an einem einzigen Tag fast 20 Milliarden Dollar liquidiert – ein neuer Negativrekord.Diese schnelle Abfolge von Zwangsverkäufen löste eine Kettenreaktion aus. Immer mehr Anleger versuchten gleichzeitig, ihre Positionen zu retten. Die Preise stürzten weiter ab, während Handelsroboter den Druck zusätzlich erhöhten. Erst am Abend kam der Markt langsam wieder zur Ruhe. Trump kündigt neue Zölle an – Märkte reagieren sofort Der Grund für den Crash lag nicht in der Technik, sondern in der Politik. US-Präsident Trump erklärte, dass er ein geplantes Treffen mit Chinas Präsident Xi Jinping absagt. Gleichzeitig kündigte er deutlich höhere Zölle auf chinesische Waren an. Er warnte, dass diese Entscheidung für amerikanische Verbraucher kurzfristig schmerzhaft sein könne. Hier kommst du zu unserer detaillierten Prognose für Bitcoin. Die Reaktion ließ nicht lange auf sich warten. China kündigte an, wichtige Rohstoffe wie seltene Erden künftig stärker zu kontrollieren. Das verschärfte die Sorgen vor einem neuen Handelskrieg. Viele Investoren sahen darin ein Zeichen wachsender Unsicherheit und zogen ihr Geld aus risikoreichen Anlagen wie Kryptowährungen ab. China sendet beruhigende Signale – Erholung setzt ein Bereits am Wochenende gab es erste Anzeichen für Entspannung. Vertreter der chinesischen Regierung betonten, man wolle den Dialog mit den USA fortsetzen. Diese Worte wirkten beruhigend auf die Märkte. Bitcoin und andere Kryptowährungen legten daraufhin wieder deutlich zu. Bitcoin back over $115,000 pic.twitter.com/I5llWSijW5 — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) October 13, 2025 Bitcoin stieg um fünf Prozent auf 115.100 Dollar, Ethereum sogar um mehr als zehn Prozent auf 4.138 Dollar. Auch Solana, BNB und Dogecoin konnten sich schnell erholen. Viele Experten sprachen von einer „Erleichterungsrally“, also einer Gegenbewegung nach zu starkem Pessimismus. Die Verkäufe nahmen ab, während Short-Positionen aufgelöst wurden. Crash war Panik, kein Zusammenbruch Marktbeobachter sehen den Absturz nicht als Zeichen einer echten Krise. Vielmehr war es eine heftige Reaktion auf politische Schlagzeilen und überhebelte Wetten. Sobald der erste Schock vorbei war, fanden Käufer schnell zurück in den Markt. Das zeigt, wie robust der Kryptomarkt trotz seiner Schwankungen inzwischen geworden ist. Les hier, wieso einige Experten bei BTC noch dieses Jahr eine Rally bis 250k sehen. Ein Analyst erklärte, dass der Ausverkauf eher ein „emotionaler Reflex“ als ein strukturelles Problem war. Anleger sollten jedoch daraus lernen, nicht zu stark auf kurzfristige Nachrichten zu reagieren. Die Ereignisse des Freitags sind ein Beispiel dafür, wie eng Politik, Wirtschaft und Krypto miteinander verbunden sind. Ob der Markt seine Erholung fortsetzt, hängt nun von weiteren politischen Entwicklungen ab. Bitcoin Hyper: Wenn die Welt wackelt, bleibt Bitcoin stark Mit Trumps neuer Zollansage an China spüren viele wieder, wie schnell Unsicherheit an den Märkten um sich greift. Genau in solchen Momenten zeigt sich, warum Bitcoin für viele zum sicheren Hafen geworden ist – unabhängig von Politik oder Zentralbanken. Doch klassische Bitcoin-Transaktionen sind langsam und teuer. Bitcoin Hyper ändert das: Durch die Verbindung mit der schnellen Solana-Technologie wird Bitcoin endlich alltagstauglich. Schnell, günstig und trotzdem sicher – perfekt für eine Zeit, in der man lieber auf Technologie als auf Schlagzeilen vertraut. Lies hier eine langfristige Prognose für Bitcoin Hyper! $HYPER: Der Turbo für die Bitcoin-Zukunft $HYPER ist nicht einfach ein weiterer Coin – er ist der Antrieb von Bitcoin Hyper. Mit ihm laufen Transaktionen blitzschnell, Staking bringt Belohnungen und neue Apps entstehen direkt auf Bitcoin. In einer Welt voller Unsicherheiten bietet Bitcoin Hyper echten Nutzen statt nur Hype.

While altcoins in particular took a major hit during this crash, a rapid recovery process began afterwards. At this point, while altcoins were trying to reduce their losses, some altcoins attracted attention in the market with their rise. At this point, Synthetix (SNX) literally said “I'm here too” after many years and became the altcoin that rose the most in the last 24 hours. According to CoinMarketCap data, SNX topped the list with a surge of more than 120% in the last 24 hours. Bittensor (TAO) followed with a 29.8% increase and Story (IP) with a 29.6% increase. Render (RENDER) rose by 21.4%, Aethir (ATH) rose by 20%, and Ethena (ENA) rose by 19.4%. On the other hand, according to Coinmarketcap data, the biggest losers in the last 24 hours are as follows: Dash (DASH) in first place with a 2.7% loss, MemeCore (M) in second place with a 1.9% loss, Zcash (ZEC) in third place with a 1.8% loss, and LEO in first place with a 0.2% loss. Why Is Synthetix (SNX) Rising? Behind this movement of SNX, which has increased by 200 percent in the last month and more than 120 percent in the last 24 hours, lies the futures exchange that the project will launch. This surge was also driven by a trading competition launched by the Synthetix project on October 20th. The competition will feature 100 high-profile traders and a $1 million prize pool. Notably, this competition will be the first futures DEX competition held on the Ethereum mainnet. *This is not investment advice.

53093029,https://invezz.com/?p=2922955,1760374337,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Dogecoin price forecast: can DOGE reclaim $0.25 as ‘House of Doge’ goes public?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/13/dogecoin-price-forecast-as-house-of-doge-goes-public-can-doge-reclaim-0-25/,"House of Doge’s Nasdaq debut has given Dogecoin (DOGE) fresh momentum. The corporate arm of the Dogecoin Foundation began trading after merging with Brag House Holdings (TBH). The move ties Dogecoin memecoin to public markets, and eyes are now on whether this corporate play can push the price of DOGE back toward the $0.25 mark. Public markets meet meme culture The House of Doge’s decision to go public is a statement as much as it is a funding move. Backers include high-profile names such as Alex Spiro, Rick Perry, the Steinbrenner family, and several NHL players. Notably, those connections create clearer pathways into sports, entertainment, and mainstream payments. The company’s management says the capital raised will speed up work on global payment rails and tokenised partnerships, which could increase real-world utility for Dogecoin. Notably, House of Doge is not just about PR stunts. The company is linked to large initiatives such as a $170 million Dogecoin treasury and filings for a spot DOGE ETF alongside 21Shares. It is also reportedly working with platforms like Robinhood to build yield and alternative investment products. If these projects materialise, they could widen on-ramps for everyday investors and create more sustained demand for Dogecoin. Tokenising sports fandom could also pull more consumer spending into the Dogecoin ecosystem. Looking at the market data, Dogecoin has been catching inflows and shedding supply from exchanges lately. Over $440 million in DOGE was left in exchange custody during recent weeks. Outflows like these reduce short-term selling pressure and often signal holder conviction. Institutional desks have also returned, driving volumes to multiple times the daily average during recent rallies. That combination of retail enthusiasm and professional activity matters for price stability. Technical analysis points to a near-term Dogecoin price breakout Dogecoin price has formed what analysts identify as a bullish pennant pattern after a steep rise and consolidation. Momentum indicators, MACD and RSI, are aligned in favour of buyers, and eyes are on whether the memecoin can break past the immediate resistance at $0.22. Source: CoinMarketCap A clean daily close above that level would increase the odds of a move toward $0.24–$0.25. Conversely, a slip under $0.20 would weaken the setup and invite short-term selling. Factors that make $0.25 target a possibility A continued reduction of exchange supply, sustained institutional buying, and a confirmed break above $0.22 would make $0.25 a realistic near-term target. And the public listing of House of Doge can serve as a demand catalyst if it drives meaningful adoption of DOGE payments or creates attractive investment products. However, these outcomes depend on execution. The market can turn quickly if product rollouts disappoint or macro headlines shift investor risk appetite.

The third-largest coin by market cap has since rallied by 66%, recovering more than $75 billion in market value on Monday’s US market session start. XRP was dragged down below $2 on Bitstamp when President Donald Trump’s tariffs on China bludgeoned crypto global markets and wiped over $20 billion, Cryptopolitan reported. The token has since regained much of its lost ground, trading at around $2.6 after climbing more than 3.5% in the last 24 hours. According to Coingecko, the recovery has pushed XRP’s total market capitalization back to $154.75 billion, up 10.2% in the past two days. The bounce back has seen the token reclaim its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) at around $2.58, a technical indicator that had previously supported bulls territory during the April market pullback. Whale activity started trading volume surge On-chain data from Santiment shows XRP whale addresses sold between $40 million and $50 million worth of XRP daily, amounting to over $1.5 billion in liquidations over the past month. The mass selling intensified market pressure, contributing to XRP’s brief drop below $1.60 during Friday’s retreat. However, renewed buying interest appears to have returned, with XRP’s daily trading volume ticking upwards more than 17% in the past 24 hours to $10.25 billion. On the derivatives market side, open interest across XRP perpetual and futures contracts climbed to $1.5 billion, a 3% increase in the last 24 hours. Futures positions did not see the same enthusiasm, tanking by 33%, meaning traders may be rotating toward perpetual instruments as volatility on the upside continues. Another clear signal of changing sentiment is in Glassnode’s Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a metric used to gauge if investors are selling at a profit or loss. The SOPR for XRP fell to 0.95 after last week’s massive crash, its lowest reading in six months. XRP SOPR. Source: Glassnode A value below 1 means that most holders are selling at a loss, a pattern associated with market capitulation before a reversal. Analyzing the behavior of $XRP investors who accumulated below ~$1, we see significant profit-taking as price surged above $2 (>100% gains). Two major realization waves—Dec 2024 and July 2025—have so far exhausted much of the market’s bullish momentum. 🔗 https://t.co/IkXZHXcnNl pic.twitter.com/P9oOux8ZO4 — glassnode (@glassnode) October 10, 2025 The last time XRP’s SOPR dropped this low was on April 7, when the token traded near $1.90 before rebounding by 35% to $2.58 within a month. Analysts suggest a similar setup could be forming, with the current SOPR chart showing a potential price base near $2.38. Should the pattern repeat, XRP’s next upward target could come between $3.10 and $3.35. Long-term holders reduce exposure Between October 2 and October 12, wallet addresses holding XRP for extended periods decreased their holdings by 27% to take profits from 163.68 million to 119.16 million. At the same time, total trading volume in XRP-based contracts jumped more than 44% over the last 24 hours to $12.2 billion, according to Coinglass. XRP has managed to rise slightly above its 20-day simple moving average at $2.42, a level that has provided some short-term resilience. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 38.65, signaling that the token is approaching oversold conditions. According to some market watchers, such readings precede potential reversals if buying momentum increases. Price levels to watch for investors are now between $2.70 and $2.80, an area that was previously its support and is now where bears have mounted their resistance. Per Glassnode, roughly 3.8 billion XRP were acquired within this price zone, a concentration of interest that could slow down upward momentum alongside further gains. Another resistance band lies between $2.88 and $2.95, where both the 50-day and 100-day SMAs converge. Some analysts believe XRP’s price movement above or below $2.50 will determine its short-term trajectory for the coming days. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

53092368,604707,1760374827,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53092368.jpeg,WazirX’s Long Road Ends: Singapore Court Clears Way For User Crypto Distribution,https://bitcoinist.com/wazirxs-singapore-court-user-crypto-distribution/,"Indian exchange WazirX has received the greenlight from the Singapore High Court, paving way for users to finally get their crypto funds back. WazirX Restructuring Approved By Singapore High Court As announced by WazirX founder and CEO Nischal Shetty in an X post , the latest Singapore High Court hearing has ended with the platform’s restructuring scheme receiving approval. The hearing marked the culmination of WazirX’s recovery efforts following the infamous July 2024 hack . This hack, which was later linked with North Korea’s Lazarus Group, drained the platform of almost $235 million in user crypto. At the time, the exchange held a total of $500 million, meaning hackers made away with about 47% of its reserve. WazirX had to cease operations once the hack became known, and to this day, users have been unable to withdraw their funds from wallets linked with it. The successful Monday hearing from the Singapore High Court, however, could finally flip the situation. The hearing was regarding WazirX’s restructuring plan that would see it restart operations. The platform had previously attempted to get a similar scheme through back in June, but the Singapore court rejected the proposal. While WazirX is an Indian exchange, its parent company, Zettai, is based in Singapore. This is why the hearings have been taking place in the Southeast Asian country, rather than the subcontinent. The High Court rejected the earlier scheme due to compliance issues with Singapore’s Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) and concerns over the involvement of Panama-based Zensui in the redistribution process. WazirX went back to the drawing board and came up with another proposal, this time with the Indian component of the platform handling the crypto redistribution instead. The court didn’t issue a decision during the September hearing, leaving creditors tense about whether the plan would be rejected again. The exchange had warned that an unsuccessful scheme could set back user fund distribution by at least two more years. After the October 13th hearing, however, creditors can finally breathe a sigh of relief, as the court has approved the proposal. “Thank you to everyone who supported this difficult phase of WazirX,” said Shetty. “Now we set out on the next phase to work hard and create value for everyone.” So far, the platform hasn’t confirmed when user redistribution will start, but earlier, it had said that creditors can expect their crypto back within 10 days of an effective scheme. On the topic of crypto hacks, North Korean hackers have continued their wave of wallet raids in 2025. According to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic , malicious players linked to Pyongyang have already stolen more than $2 billion in digital assets so far this year. This marks the largest yearly total of crypto thefts ever attributed to North Korea, as the below chart shows. The majority of this figure is contributed by the massive $1.46 billion theft from Bybit . Besides the big exchange hacks, North Korean hackers have also been employing more subtle tactics to steal from digital asset wallets. A recent report revealed that attackers from the nation are masquerading as recruiters to lure in applicants with fake job offers and make off with their funds.

53092346,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86232,1760374843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Crypto Gems Spotted: Why BlockDAG, Cardano, and XRP Are the Best Crypto Coins to Buy Before the Next Bull Run!",https://timestabloid.com/crypto-gems-spotted-why-blockdag-cardano-and-xrp-are-the-best/,"The crypto market is entering a pivotal moment as investors search for the best crypto coin to buy ahead of the next major rally. Three contenders, BlockDAG (BDAG), Cardano (ADA), and XRP, are dominating investor conversations with a mix of technology, partnerships, and real-world traction. BlockDAG’s presale has already raised over $420 million, setting it apart as the fastest-growing Layer-1 project of 2025. Meanwhile, Cardano continues to strengthen institutional credibility, and XRP’s whale accumulation signals major market moves. Each of these cryptos offers a unique value proposition, scalability, stability, and speed, making them top choices for long-term investors. As November’s Genesis Day approaches for BlockDAG, the window to buy before prices surge is closing fast. Here’s why these three assets are considered the best crypto coins to buy right now. 1. BlockDAG: $420M+ Raised, Ready for Genesis Day! BlockDAG’s current presale price sits at $0.0012, but that price won’t last much longer. Having raised more than $420 million, the project has become one of the most anticipated Layer-1 launches of 2025. Its hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work architecture delivers parallel processing for unmatched speed while maintaining Bitcoin-level security, combining the best of both scalability and stability. What makes BlockDAG stand out as the best crypto coin to buy is its proven credibility. It’s been audited by CertiK and Halborn, confirming robust smart contract security, while the BWT Alpine Formula 1® Team partnership has propelled it into the global mainstream. The upcoming Genesis Day on November 26 will mark the final acceleration before BDAG goes live, and whales are buying aggressively in anticipation of a price correction toward its $0.05 listing target. With 3 million mobile miners, 312,000 holders, and 4,500+ developers already building in its ecosystem, BlockDAG isn’t just another presale; it’s a movement. The combination of real-world visibility, proven infrastructure, and massive presale momentum makes BDAG arguably the best crypto coin to buy before the market resets. Every indicator from whale activity to testnet engagement suggests that once trading goes live, BlockDAG could become one of the fastest-growing assets of the decade. 2. Cardano: Institutional Index Listing Pushes ADA Higher Cardano continues to build its case as one of the best crypto coins to buy for those seeking institutional-grade exposure. Its recent inclusion in the S&P Digital Markets 50 Index is a major step forward, signaling growing recognition among institutional investors. Beyond this, Cardano’s development arm, Apex Fusion, has expanded interoperability via LayerZero, connecting ADA’s UTxO model with over 140 EVM-compatible blockchains. This focus on interoperability positions Cardano to bridge traditional blockchain silos, a long-standing challenge in crypto. The community’s approval of a $71 million treasury fund targeting Hydra and Ouroboros Leios upgrades underscores its commitment to scaling sustainably. Founder Charles Hoskinson recently noted that Bitcoin’s halving cycles are losing dominance as institutional flows become the new market driver, adding to Cardano’s appeal. Currently trading near $0.83, ADA shows technical strength with support at $0.80 and potential resistance near $0.90. Analysts expect a breakout above $1 if developer activity remains strong through Q4 2025. Cardano’s steady evolution, regulatory clarity, and developer engagement cement its place among the best crypto coins to buy heading into the next bull market. 3. Kaspa: High-Speed Architecture Built for Scale Kaspa remains one of the most technologically advanced proof-of-work projects, leveraging its unique blockDAG architecture to achieve lightning-fast confirmations and near-instant block propagation. Despite temporary network slowdowns and withdrawal suspensions across select exchanges like Bitget and ViaBTC, market sentiment remains resilient. Traders view this period as an accumulation phase, expecting a recovery as technical upgrades restore full stability. At a current trading range near $0.074, Kaspa is consolidating after recent corrections but continues to attract miners and long-term holders. The network’s ability to scale without sacrificing decentralization sets it apart from traditional blockchains. As network reliability improves and miner participation strengthens, analysts expect renewed bullish pressure into 2025. With strong fundamentals, Kaspa’s architecture and community-driven momentum keep it on the radar as one of the best crypto coins to buy during market consolidation. 4. XRP: Whale Accumulation Surges XRP continues to be a top contender for the title of best crypto coin to buy as institutional accumulation surges past $1.1 billion this week alone. Following Ripple’s landmark legal clarity with the SEC, XRP has cemented its role as one of the few digital assets explicitly cleared for institutional payment use. Recent price action shows XRP hovering around $2.82, with short-term volatility overshadowed by long-term optimism. Analysts forecast mid-term upside targets between $8 and $13, driven by expanding real-world adoption. Ripple’s strategic partnership with Bahrain’s FinTech Bay is further expanding its footprint in the Middle East, a region rapidly embracing blockchain-powered financial infrastructure. Institutional investors now view XRP as more than just a remittance token; it’s a global liquidity solution. As cross-border volumes continue to grow, XRP’s blend of legal certainty and corporate integration makes it one of the most resilient and best crypto coins to buy for 2025 and beyond. Final Thoughts The next bull market may be defined by projects that blend credibility, adoption, and innovation, and that’s exactly what BlockDAG, Cardano, and XRP deliver. BlockDAG’s $0.0012 presale and over $420 million raised highlight unstoppable momentum ahead of Genesis Day, while Cardano’s interoperability upgrades and XRP’s institutional integration reinforce their long-term strength. For investors searching for the best crypto coin to buy , these three stand out as rare opportunities where fundamentals meet timing. As whales continue accumulating and market sentiment shifts bullish, the clock is ticking toward a major revaluation. Whether you’re looking for next-gen infrastructure, institutional adoption, or cross-border dominance, these projects are leading the charge into 2025’s next crypto breakout.

53092525,https://timestabloid.com/?p=86238,1760375115,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Remains Extremely Bullish On XRP. Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-remains-extremely-bullish-on-xrp-heres-why/,"The mere suggestion that “extreme bullishness” applies to a cryptocurrency invites skepticism—especially in markets where overnight reversals are the norm. Yet, this week XRP’s price narrative delivered such clarity that some observers now view its trajectory with renewed optimism. According to CryptoBull’s published X post, one of the most persuasive signals is that XRP closed the week decisively above a year-long uptrend line —a technical milestone that, analysts argue, has the potential to reshape sentiment and position the token for continued strength. Technical Breakout: Validating the Long-Term Slope Trendlines drawn across months of XRP’s price action are not mere chart aesthetics but reflections of sustained market psychology. That supplies drawn from highs and lows since late 2024 have formed a rising diagonal support, and, as CryptoBull notes, the weekly close above that line elevates its importance from tentative guide to confirmed structural support. In effect, resistance that once threatened to cap upside may now act as a springboard. This shift is especially significant in trending markets: when price breaks above a long-held trendline on volume and holds it, the old ceiling often becomes the new floor. #XRP closed the week above year long uptrend. Extremely bullish! pic.twitter.com/Y0TZai7YPM — CryptoBull (@CryptoBull2020) October 13, 2025 Multiple market watchers affirm that the week’s rebound carried volume backing and conviction in its latter sessions, effectively ending the week in a zone of validation. CoinDesk reports that XRP recovered nearly USD 30 billion in market value during the move, with a sharp late-session push helping to seal the weekly close above projection levels. That tactical recovery supports CryptoBull’s interpretation of the structure as being more than a fleeting test. Market Psychology: What Changes After the Close The importance of closing above the trendline matters more than intraday intrusions. It signals that bulls remained in control until the end, deterring momentum sellers and implying an institutional backdrop that views the level as defendable. Of course, for skeptics, it could be an overreach if the price fails to hold or reverses sharply. But for technical strategists, this kind of test-and-confirm scenario often triggers renewed entries on pullbacks to the line. Furthermore, traders will now recontextualize prior resistance zones—such as the familiar $2.70–$3.10 band—as zones of near-term opportunity rather than immediate barriers. In fact, top traders have flagged that reclaiming $2.70 in recent weeks was critical; this week’s structure gives that level renewed significance. Forward Projections & Risks With the structural bias leaning bullish , projection methodologies point toward meaningful upside—should momentum persist. Some chart models propose long-range targets at $14 and even $28, based on extensions of long-term patterns. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Meanwhile, more near-term approaches peg resistance between $3.05 and $3.12 as key hurdles; a sustained breakout above those could shift market regimes. That said, the bullish case is not unconditional. The critical pivot lies in failing to hold above that trendline; a decisively negative weekly close beneath it would erode confidence and draw attention to lower supports near $2.50 or below. Momentum indicators (RSI, MACD) and volume behavior will carry extra weight as confirming filters. Analysts warn that overextension or divergences must be heeded as early warning signs. What to Watch Now For traders and observers alike, the immediate test is follow-through price action above resistance zones and retention of support on pullbacks. Confirmed accumulation on-chain, institutional reentry, and fresh macro drivers (e.g. regulatory developments, ETF news) could further validate the bullish structural scenario. As CryptoBull’s assessment implies, this week’s close didn’t guarantee a parabolic run—but it reshaped the bias and elevated odds in favor of sustained upside, assuming discipline and risk management stay intact. This is not a guarantee—but if price respects the newly minted support and continues upward, the technical groundwork laid this week may prove pivotal in XRP’s next leg.

Anand said her task is delicate and complex because her country’s disputes with both Asian countries are serious. She pointed out that any move to ease the tensions could trigger President Donald Trump’s wrath. Trump has threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on China, causing equity markets to nosedive despite the U.S. president signaling openness to a truce. However, the Foreign Minister argued that Canada is taking the same precautionary steps as every other country, which revolves around prioritizing the interests of its businesses and labor force. Prime Minister Mark Carney has prioritized economic interests above all else, scrapping most of the former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s policies on Canada’s foreign trade. Anand says sovereignty is crucial in international relationships The Foreign Minister said being a sovereign nation is crucial for Canada to balance its relations with the U.S. and China. Given the current geopolitical environment, she emphasized the importance of maintaining stable relations with major global economic players. Prime Minister Carney’s negotiating team seeks to strike a deal with the U.S. that will offer some relief from Trump’s tariffs. Their pitch mainly focuses on fortifying the North American supply chain to counter China. Trudeau previously joined former U.S. President Joe Biden in putting up a tariff wall against Chinese EVs, steel, and aluminum. Meanwhile, China has imposed massive tariffs on Canadian seafood, canola, and pork, although it has extended its deadline for investigating Canadian canola. Carney says this will allow time for more negotiations as Western Canada urges him to drop the EV levies if it will remove tariffs on food exports. “It goes back to being a sovereign country…Canada is going to approach the relationship with China guided by one principle — acting in the best interest of Canadians.” – Anita Anand , Canada’s Foreign Minister The Canadian Prime Minister believes there is potential for positive Canada-China trade relations in the energy sector. Carney expects to eventually meet President Xi Jinping, hoping to get the opportunity during the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in South Korea. He is also bullish on exporting more Canadian liquefied natural gas to Asia. Anand also pointed out that China and Canada could still come together to push for climate change. She added that Canada already has many businesses actively engaged in that space. Canada normalizes diplomatic relations with India Anand observed that Canada is gradually normalizing diplomatic relations with India under Prime Minister Carney. Each of the two countries has reportedly appointed new ambassadors and established structures for cross-border interactions. The Foreign Minister recently raised concerns about transnational repression during her meeting with India’s External Affairs Minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, last month, and is expected to reiterate the issue at their next meeting. However, Anand acknowledged that the progress towards a trade deal with India has always been sluggish. She added that further discussions would follow later, after both countries agree on a roadmap for building stronger ties. A joint statement from Anand and Jaishankar revealed that Canada and India will initiate ministerial-level discussions on bilateral trade, followed by a Canada-India CEO Forum in early 2026. They agreed to re-establish ministerial-level talks on energy and identify how Canada can supply India with minerals. Both ministers also believe that a strong, resilient bilateral relationship between the two countries is essential during the current period of uncertainty and rising geopolitical issues. They emphasized the importance of reviving the Canada-India relationship to enhance economic cooperation and create opportunities. Anand and Jaishankar also claimed that the partnership is expected to help mitigate vulnerabilities stemming from shifting alliances in global trade. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

The collaboration introduces a unified margin framework that enables users to manage risk, collateral, and capital efficiency across several DeFi venues. This marks a step toward solving one of the biggest structural inefficiencies in DeFi fragmented liquidity and isolated collateral management. Cross-Margin Efficiency Comes to Solana DeFi According to the press release , under current DeFi conditions, users must overcollateralize on each platform separately. This practice not only traps liquidity but also increases liquidation risk when positions are not interconnected. The Kamino Project 0 integration directly tackles this problem by consolidating deposits under a single margin account. Users can now borrow against their holdings on both platforms with shared loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and borrow weights. Besides simplifying portfolio management, the new system introduces risk-adjusted parameters that evaluate the user’s entire portfolio rather than isolated positions. This holistic approach allows traders to use their assets more effectively while maintaining a clearer view of their overall exposure. Consequently, DeFi participants gain improved flexibility and can access capital with fewer restrictions. Founder MacBrennan Peet emphasized that Project 0 was built to remove liquidity fragmentation across decentralized markets. The integration with Kamino turns this goal into reality by establishing the first generalized cross-margin model across multiple DeFi venues. Traders can now use a single pool of credit to engage in arbitrage between Kamino and Project 0 rates, thereby reducing friction and optimizing capital efficiency. Expanding Access and Efficiency Initially, the new system is available to Project 0’s top 5,000 users. This select group will test the integration and provide feedback before a broader rollout. Following this initial phase, the feature will become accessible to the public in a gradual release expected within five days. The phased launch ensures stability and smooth user experience as the system scales. In addition to traders, lenders will also benefit from this integration. Kamino and Project 0 depositors can access unified interfaces to track and manage their assets while earning incentives from Project 0’s ecosystem. The ability to move liquidity freely and manage risk across venues could set a new standard for capital deployment within the Solana DeFi landscape. Solana’s Price Outlook Strengthens While Kamino’s integration is enhancing DeFi infrastructure, Solana (SOL) continues to test key resistance near the $200 mark. The token has gained 1.74% in the past 24 hours, trading around $197 with strong volume. Analyst Crypto Patel believes Solana is forming a long-term “cup and handle” pattern on the three-week chart. A breakout above $245 could propel SOL toward $480–$500, and potentially as high as $6,000 in the next macro bull phase. Source: X Meanwhile, analyst Xoom noted that Solana’s current struggle around $200 mirrors earlier resistance zones. Breaking above this level could spark rapid movement toward $240–$260. However, failure to clear this threshold may lead to consolidation between $180 and $200 until the broader market strengthens.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|SOL|TRADING|SPONSORED|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-13 17:10:38

Moreover, it has gained 80% since the $0.014 low (on CoinGecko) marked during the market-wide crash. Channel Support Remains Intact According to a weekly chart shared by Ali Martinez, PENGU is still holding within a descending channel that has been in place since July. The recent drop caused a long wick below the structure, but the candle closed back inside the channel. The asset is now approaching $0.026, with support seen at $0.023. What happened on Friday was far from normal. Some call it a black swan; others call it extreme manipulation. Most charts now show insane wicks to the downside, but strip out the noise and you’ll see $PENGU holding structure. If $0.023 holds, a breakout to $0.13 is in play. pic.twitter.com/eQlbH0IzRU — Ali (@ali_charts) October 13, 2025 Meanwhile, the analyst said Friday’s drop was “far from normal” and described by some as a “black swan” event. Despite the sharp movement, the price structure remains valid. If support holds, a move toward $0.13 is still possible based on the channel’s breakout projection. A separate analysis from CryptoPulse points to a bullish flag on the daily chart. After dipping outside the formation, the asset quickly returned inside. This suggests the pattern may still be in play. The next upside zone is projected near $0.032 to $0.034. Notably, the setup depends on the price remaining above the lower trendline. CryptoPulse noted that a drop below this line could shift the outlook, with $0.017 as the next support to monitor. For now, higher lows continue to form along the support level. Momentum Indicators Turn Positive Short-term indicators are showing signs of recovery. The Bollinger Bands on the 4-hour chart show the price rebounding above the middle band, with resistance near $0.0296. The MACD line has crossed above the signal line, and the histogram is back in positive territory, showing early momentum in favor of buyers. Source: TradingView Market data shows a shift in trader positioning. The long/short ratio for PENGU has climbed from below 0.80 on October 10 to above 1.10 by October 12. Buy volume is outpacing sell volume, pointing to increased bullish sentiment among participants.

Trading has officially started today. Users now have the ability to trade options on SOL, Micro SOL, XRP, and Micro XRP futures, with expiries available every day of the business week, every month and every quarter.

Explore Crypto options contracts ➡️ https://t.co/lVXqqYagAG pic.twitter.com/RF5COIFX98 — CME Group (@CMEGroup) October 13, 2025 According to CME , these options allow physical delivery against corresponding futures and support both standard and micro contract trading. They also carry the advantage of enhancing risk management tools for institutional traders. CME’s futures for XRP and SOL increase optimism In 2017, the CME approved the first Bitcoin Futures contract, effectively signaling its interest in crypto. Over time, the mega exchange listed more crypto products, including Ethereum, Solana, and XRP futures. Also, they have added not only futures but also option contracts for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and now XRP and SOL. Futures are contracts to buy or sell an asset at a set price on a future date, while options give traders the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell those futures at predetermined prices. The benefit is that the more crypto options products the CME lists, the better the liquidity and price efficiency of the associated tokens become. The involvement of institutional-grade market makers and hedge funds effectively deepens liquidity pools for SOL and XRP, tightening spreads and reducing slippage. According to a previous statement by Giovanni Vicioso, CME Group Global Head of Cryptocurrency Products, “Available in two different sizes, these contracts will offer a wide range of market participants – from institutions to sophisticated, active, individual traders – additional choice and greater flexibility to manage their exposure to two market-leading cryptocurrencies.” Meanwhile, institutional investors are quickly embracing CME’s futures for XRP and Solana. The standard Solana futures contract, sized at 500 SOL, launched in mid-March and crossed the $1 billion notional open interest mark in August. On the other hand, futures tied to the payments-focused XRP crossed that threshold in August, just three months after they began trading with a standard contract size of 50,000 XRP. Notional open interest, which represents the outstanding value of contracts, reached a record $39 billion in mid-September, CME said. In August, CME had 335,200 outstanding contracts, up 95% year-over-year, it said. The organization is also working towards another goal. According to its official announcement, its crypto futures and options, which currently cover Bitcoin and Ethereum, will become tradable 24/7 in early 2026, pending regulatory review. Global crypto derivatives open interest holds near $4 billion Due to regulatory clarity from measures such as the GENIUS Act and a pro-crypto White House, demand for regulated crypto derivative products has been growing steadily. So far, the demand has been met by traditional exchanges as well as US-based fintech companies and crypto platforms. In February, Coinbase introduced Solana (SOL) futures contracts in the US, including standard and “nano” contract sizes. The exchange later announced the acquisition of the options exchange Deribit. Open interest across crypto futures and perpetual contracts. Source: CoinMarketCap In addition, Crypto exchange Kraken launched its derivatives arm in the country in July, and Robinhood rolled out micro futures contracts for Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP through its derivatives arm. The surge of regulated offerings in the US comes as global crypto derivatives open interest holds near $4 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. Meanwhile, the Solana price showed sustained momentum in an uptrend during August and September, gaining about 60% from the lows of $157. Even after the recent market downturn, the Solana price has managed to recover and is again taking support near $191. SOL is currently trading at $194.77 after surging 3% in the last 24 hours. On the other hand, XRP clawed back $30 billion in market value after last week’s collapse, ripping from $2.37 to $2.56 on explosive institutional volume. The coin is up 3.74% in the last 24 hours.

Short sellers are starting to feel the squeeze, and the setup could fuel another breakout. In the past 24 hours, trading volume has surged to nearly $1 billion , now representing 30% of the circulating supply, as momentum continues to build around the third-largest meme coin. Here’s what the charts are saying can happen next. Pepe Price Prediction: PEPE Needs to Recapture the $0.0000080 Level to Get Back on Track Pepe broke below its trend line support during last week’s drop, but is now retesting the same price channel from below. If it can reclaim the $0.00000800 level, that would invalidate the bearish setup and reopen the door to further gains. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is climbing out of oversold territory, suggesting the recent selloff may have been overdone and that bulls are starting to regain control. A move toward $0.00001200 would confirm a bullish shift, potentially setting up a rally toward $0.00001800 , a 142% upside from current levels. At the same time, a new mine-to-earn (M2E) game inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme is quickly gaining traction. PEPENODE lets you mine coins using virtual mining rigs, no hardware needed . This crypto presale has already raised $1.8 million and it could be the next breakout hit born from the Pepe craze. Pepenode ($PEPENODE) Lets Any User Mine Meme Coins with No Hardware Buying and holding meme coins has been quite rewarding for early investors in the past.

Pepenode ($PEPENODE) takes the hassle out of mining by introducing a new mine-to-earn (M2E) game where players can set up virtual servers, operate as many rigs as they want to mine tokens, and upgrade their infrastructure instantly to increase their output. A competitive environment will ensure that the demand for $PEPENODE, the game’s utility token, will remain strong. Top miners will be rewarded with surprise airdrops of popular meme coins like Bonk ($BONK) and Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN), along with the bragging rights that come naturally. Buying pressure on $PEPENODE is expected to grow as popularity of the platform grows, pushing the price higher as time goes on.

Yesterday, Bitcoin developers shared the latest Core version on X, along with the release notes. But that post received heavy criticism from Bitcoin enthusiasts, especially Knots supporters. Core v30 is attacked heavily Bitcoin Core received a ton of negative comments. One user wrote, “Bitcoin Core v30 is a mistake. Removing OP_RETURN limits opens the door to endless junk data…” Another person discouraged node operators from downloading the new Core version. “Bitcoin core developers have bent the knee to spammers. The OP_RETURN change is senseless,” said a third user. The Bitcoin Knots community didn’t hold back either. For context, Bitcoin Knots is a software fork of Bitcoin Core, led by Luke Dashjr , a Bitcoin developer from the early 2010s. Bitcoin Knots is fully compatible with Bitcoin Core, but it has more policy-level and optional features than Core. The Knots community kept pushing the narrative that OP_RETURN spam could include CSAM, which would lead to legal trouble for BTC miners and node operators. A Knots supporter said, “Run knots be humble mark core malware.” Another said, “Since core team is making it easier and cheaper to spam the #bitcoin network with non-monetary data, my trust in them is broken and I’m gonna continue running knots.” Crypto Twitter — or crypto X, in this case — was a mess. But Adam Back didn’t hold back. He pushed for Bitcoin Core v30, replied to people, and shared supportive posts. Back fully supports Bitcoin Core v30 Back has supported Bitcoin Core v30 before its release. He said he “will be running Bitcoin v30.” A user by the name of Chris Guida asked Back if he’s going to run Bitcoin Core v30, Bitcoin Knots v30, or even something else. Back replied , “Ha you spotted what most did not.” He continued to explain that there’s no difference between Core 30 and Knots 30 since both have the same Bitcoin v30 codebase. Back stated that having a data size carrier equivalent to 100kB has been a consensus valid since its inception in 2014. He added that miners and nodes already allow and confirm these kinds of large transactions. It’s not something new that v30 will suddenly introduce. Also , adding data to Bitcoin is 4 times expensive, so it will be difficult to abuse the network. Blaming Core v30 is pointless because people can already add spam to the network. Back explained earlier in October that it’s possible to hide data in scripts. This is applicable to all programming languages. He wrote, “We can’t really stop that. What do you think say limiting tapscript to 4kb instead of 400kb will do? Via policy or soft fork even? (Hint it will do nothing, spammers will chop their spam up into 100 parts.)” After the release of Core v30, Adam Back said Bitcoin will have far worse problems if the community fails to make rational changes. He added, “Socially attacking, urging rejection of security & robustness fixes from 200 most skilled people on the planet is itself an attack on Bitcoin. There are security fixes in v30.” If we socially lose the ability to make rational changes, Bitcoin has far worse problems. Socially attacking, urging rejection of security & robustness fixes from 200 most skilled people on the planet is itself an attack on Bitcoin. There are security fixes in v30. — Adam Back (@adam3us) October 12, 2025 According to an earlier report by Cryptopolitan, Bitcoin Core v30 added numerous useful changes to the network, including lower default fees, an upgraded wallet and GUI, along with the expanded OP_RETURN data limit.

The tensions shook global markets, causing the largest cryptocurrency liquidation in history, the company said. According to a report by QCP Capital, Bitcoin (BTC) briefly fell to $102,000 before recovering to $112,000. However, $19 billion worth of leveraged positions were liquidated in the process, marking the largest liquidation in crypto history. The largest exchange-wide fluctuations occurred on Binance. According to the report, the USD price collapsed to $0.65, while wBETH traded at a 90% discount to its ETH counterpart. BNSOL also saw its price drop by over 80%. Other major exchanges did not experience such volatility. QCP Capital stated that these extreme price fluctuations on Binance could be a sign of a possible coordinated attack. The company noted that the exchange recently announced system updates for these three assets, potentially creating a potential “window of vulnerability.” The market crash came after a sudden surge in tensions in US-China relations. Trump accused China of “trying to hold the world hostage,” while the White House announced a 100% tariff on all Chinese imports and new export restrictions on critical software. China is reportedly preparing to impose export restrictions on rare earths and other industrial inputs starting November 1st. Related News: Hyperliquid, the Most Popular Exchange of All Time, Targets Binance for the Recent Crash! Here Are the Accusations... Following these developments, global stock markets also plummeted: the Nasdaq fell 3.5%, and the S&P 500 fell 2.7%. Short-term volatility in crypto markets skyrocketed; BTC's one-week implied volatility (ATM) peaked at 98 before falling back to 50 as the market partially stabilized. Later in the day, US Vice President JD Vance's statement that “we are open to reasonable negotiations with China” eased some of the selling pressure ahead of the Asian session. However, QCP Capital warned that liquidity remains fragile, policy risk remains high, and investors remain cautious. “Markets may stabilize for now, but China’s response will determine direction in the coming weeks,” the company said. *This is not investment advice.

This is especially since bitcoin miners face increasingly expensive operations from the April 2024 halving, the volatility arising from cryptocurrency trade, and the reduced supply moving forward. TeraWulf has strategically leveraged its existing infrastructure across low-cost, predominantly zero-carbon power, racks, and cooling systems, along with a veteran energy infrastructure management team. Thanks to the early days of its HPC prospects, the stock boasts relatively cheap FY 2027 valuations compared to its legacy hyperscaler/neocloud/data center REIT peers as well. Given TeraWulf's elevated trading volumes, the drastically higher short interest volume, and the tariff risks into the Q3 2025 earnings call, there may be an excellent dip buy opportunity ahead. WULF Remains Attractively Valued Despite The Recent Rally, Thanks To Its Outsized HPC Prospects & Rich Funding I previously covered the Big Tech hyperscalers and neoclouds in numerous older articles, discussing their monetization prospects during the AI and data center capex boom. In this article, I shall be covering TeraWulf Inc. (NASDAQ: WULF ) and sharing my findings about the stock, continuing the theme surrounding the cloud sector. For the uninitiated, WULF is a company that was previously generating revenue as a Bitcoin miner and by hosting third-party Bitcoin miners before diversifying to be an infrastructure provider in 2024 for High Performance Computing [HPC] workloads during the ongoing multi-year cloud super cycle. This is a trend that I have previously observed with CoreWeave ( CRWV ), which used to be a cryptocurrency mining company in 2017 before transitioning to be a cloud computing provider after the cryptocurrency crash in 2019. Notably, CRWV has announced its plans to acquire another cryptocurrency mining/HPC company, Core Scientific ( CORZ ), for $9B, attributed to the attractiveness of the latter's "" energy-heavy sites and power contracts to expand computing infrastructure,"" with the deal effectively valuing the latter at an annualized FQ2 2025 EV/sales valuations of 28.62x . Given the insatiable demand for compute power and the ongoing AI boom across the infrastructure/SaaS layers, it is unsurprising that five of the world's largest hyperscalers by market share, Amazon ( AMZN ), Microsoft ( MSFT ), Google ( GOOG ), Alibaba ( BABA ), and Oracle ( ORCL ) in respective order, have been reporting robust cloud-related revenues while hinting at higher data center/AI chip-related capex trends in 2026. The same has also triggered the emergence of neoclouds, such as CRWV and Nebius Group ( NBIS ), as they offer AI-focused infrastructure as a service through GPU-backed servers. Here is where WULF has stood out uniquely, attributed to its strategic decision to simply offer infrastructure (including low-cost, predominantly zero-carbon power along with data center infrastructure including racks, cooling systems, and other ancillary services) with the cloud tenants to provide the "" gut ,"" i.e., the GPUs. I believe that this is a highly strategic decision indeed, since GPUs are typically prohibitively expensive and tight in supply, with it likely to trigger slim profit margins as similarly observed in another cloud provider, ORCL, at a gross profit margin of ~14% for "" rentals of servers powered by Nvidia's ( NVDA ) chips."" Combined with the AI GPU's accelerated depreciation costs , the "" significant stress "" on data center chips potentially triggering an intensified replacement cycle, and NVDA's choice to release new AI chips annually, I believe that WULF's ongoing pivot to HPC provider has been rather well thought out. This development implies that WULF may very well maintain its balance sheet health with a cash position of $89.99M ( -58.7% QoQ / -13.5% YoY ) aside from the Convertible Notes of $488.71M maturing in 2030, $1B in 2031 , and $3.2B backing from GOOG without going into significant GPU-related capex as that observed with CRWV. This is on top of the much needed diversification away from the bitcoin mining operations, attributed to: The cryptocurrency's halving event in 2024 (typically reducing the reward for mining new blocks by 50%, which impacts the supply and potentially the price of Bitcoin), The volatility arising from the bitcoin trade/ prices, and The reduced supply of Bitcoins to be mined at 1.07M moving forward (~5% of overall supply at 21M). WULF 1Y Stock Price TradingView Combined with the ongoing AI mania and the consistently higher leasing price per KW of data center capacity at $218 in FQ2 2025 ( +23.8% YoY / +77.2% from FQ4 2019 level ), as reported by a pure-play data-center REIT, Digital Realty ( DLR ), I can understand why WULF's ongoing pivot and growing partnership/funding have driven the outsized stock price performance. This is especially since the recent agreement expansion with Fluidstack ""anchors ~$3.7B in contracted revenues , with potential to reach $8.7B through lease extensions,"" with ~250 MW of additional gross IT load to be available from the end of 2026 onwards. It is apparent that WULF's vertically integrated HPC infrastructure offerings and the management team of veteran energy infrastructure entrepreneurs have worked out extremely well in driving accelerated buildout, deployment, and eventually top/bottom line recognition at a time when certain data center REITs are constrained by power availability . The Conse nsus Forward Estimates Tikr Terminal These reasons may also be why the consensus has been raising their forward estimates, with WULF expected to report an accelerated top-line growth at a CAGR of +80.2% through FY 2027, while also reporting EBIT profitability in FY 2026 and positive adj EPS in FY 2026. Thanks to the growing funding availability, I believe that the company is likely to remain well capitalized during the ongoing build out of its HPC infrastructure, with it presenting little risk to its cash flows. WULF Valuations Seeking Alpha These reasons may also be why the market has re-rated WULF to FWD EV/Sales valuations of 28.94x and FWD EV/EBITDA valuations of 118.43x, with it apparent that the premium is attributed to the ongoing transition to a cloud provider, as similarly observed in the notable upgrading from the 3Y mean of 6.35x/0.50x, respectively. Given the early days of its HPC prospects, based on the Enterprise Value of $5.93B by the time of writing, the consensus FY 2027 revenue estimates of $820.17M and adj. EBITDA estimates of $448.46M, I am looking at a relatively attractive FY 2027 EV/Sales valuations of 7.23x and FY 2027 EV/EBITDA valuations of 13.22x. When compared to its HPC/neocloud/data center REIT peers, including: AMZN at FWD EV/Sales valuations of 3.35x and FWD EV/EBITDA valuations of 14.25x, GOOG at 7.12x/15.96x, MSFT at 11.82x/20.02x, ORCL at 13.97x/26.21x, CRWV at 16.41x/25.62x, NBIS at 55.50x/NA, CORZ at 14.74x/48.84x, DLR at NA/29.66x, and Equinix ( EQIX ) at NA/x, respectively, it goes without saying that WULF's nascent HPC prospects remain attractively valued here. On the other hand, readers may want to note the risks arising from its tenant concentration, since a bursting AI bubble may trigger lease reduction and/or cancellations, with it underscoring why investors may want to observe for further diversification in the company's tenant base beyond Fluidstack (at a current capacity of 260 MW) and Core42 (at a current capacity of 72.5MW) for an improved margin of safety. So, Is WULF Stock A Buy , Sell, or Hold? WULF 15Y Stock Price TradingView For now, WULF has already notably broken out of numerous resistance levels to retest the $13s ranges by the time of writing, with it presenting a notable +555.8% rally since the 52 weeks bottom. WULF's Overbought Levels TradingView The overly fast/furious rally may also be why WULF appears to be overbought at current levels, as observed in the inflated RSI and nearly peaking trading volumes by the time of writing, worsened by the drastically higher short interest volumes by +149.4% on a YoY basis and the elevated ratio at 41.7%. Combined with the ongoing insider selling at current inflated levels and the overly done AI exuberance, I believe that a double digits correction may be in the books in the near term, with traders likely to take profits at current inflated levels. With it remaining to be seen how the upcoming Q3 2025 earning season may develop, as the tariff risks kick in, it may be more prudent to wait for much of the exuberance to be moderated. As a result of its highly promising, nascent HPC transition, my initial Buy rating for the WULF stock comes with the caveat that investors observe the stock price movement for a little longer and only add after a moderate retracement to the 50/100-day moving averages for a lower dollar cost average. Given the potential -29.5% downside from current levels, some patience may be more prudent for a lower dollar cost average and improved long-term return prospects.",WULF,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|BTC|ZRX,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-13 17:29:49

Amongst speculative altcoins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a project that marries innovation and opportunity. Already in Phase 6 of its presale, and having already sold out over 65%, MUTM is delivering evidence that it’s designed for exponential growth. With a phased presale, community-governance, and utilities that seek to redefine decentralized finance, Mutuum Finance is turning out to be the type of utility token that may deliver the next 100x returns, and leave meme coins like SHIB in the wake. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Analysis Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains to show tenacity, staying firm at $0.000012 and signaling a possible rebound towards key resistance and the 200-day EMA. With volume gradually relaxing but ETF speculation increasing, institutional demand for SHIB is slowly building. Technicians indicate that a breakout over $0.000015 can trigger a rally to $0.000021, particularly if volume increases and momentum continues to gain momentum. Though SHIB may be priming for its next breakout, investors seeking the next spot of dramatic growth are looking towards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) altcoin with strong use case and structured presale. Mutuum Finance Presale FOMO Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as a crypto to watch out for in the DeFi sector. It is already in Phase 6 presale, with the tokens costing $0.035 up 16.17% from Phase 5. Already over 16,910 investors have invested over $17.25 million worth into the presale, having trust in the project’s long-term road map alongside DeFi dream. With over 65% sold out so far during Phase 6, investors have very little time to purchase the tokens before the phase runs out. The early investors have the potential to gain humongous profits when MUTM will be listed on the open market. The project is also partnering with CertiK to introduce the $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program, in which white-hat hackers, developers, and security specialists are rewarded for bug finding. Bugs are classified based on the level of severity, critical, major, minor, and low, and are compensated accordingly. Next-Gen Lending and Borrowing Protocol There will also be the release of Mutuum Finance’s lending and borrowing protocol , building its DeFi platform. Version 1 (V1), to be released on Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, will contain the key characteristics such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a liquidator bot. There will be compatibility of both ETH and USDT right from day one to collateralization, lending, and borrowing, with the goal being an end-to-end DeFi solution that is secure, scalable, and user-friendly. Mutuum Finance Utility Token to Lead in 2025 Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) sits firm at $0.000012, growth-hungry investors are looking to Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With Phase 6 of its presale already having grossed in excess of $17.25 million via over 16,910 investors, and having sold 65% of tokens to date, marking high confidence in the project, its imminent lending and borrowing protocol on Sepolia Testnet, alongside liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and security based on CertiK-backed measures, makes it a next-generation DeFi platform designed for real-world use and long-term adoption. Time is of the essence for Phase 6, and growth-hungry investors searching for the next high-potential altcoin must grab Mutuum Finance tokens immediately to take advantage of this emerging opportunity.

TeraWulf's partnerships could generate up to $15.7B in revenue over a decade, with Google backstopping $3.2B in lease obligations and taking a 14% equity stake. Aggressive buildout targets and innovative deal structures position TeraWulf for rapid growth, with analysts forecasting a near 100% CAGR in revenue over two years. Despite risks like share dilution and potential demand drops, Google's involvement and strong revenue prospects justify a Buy rating on TeraWulf. Investment Thesis Just like many of its crypto miner peers, TeraWulf Inc. ( WULF ) also started off this year with one goal in mind—to diversify its data center infrastructure footprint away from crypto mining towards the highly lucrative AI/HPC (high-performance) workload space. The Maryland-based crypto miner struck a deal with Core42, the UAE-based cloud service provider, to deliver brand-new data center infrastructure equipment to Core42 by the end of the year, resulting in a billion dollars of potential revenues over a decade. As if that was not enough, the crypto miner also struck a deal with Alphabet Inc. ( GOOG ) (GOOGL) and Fluidstack that sees the search giant become a major investor in TeraWulf’s transformation into an AI data center infrastructure company. The nature of these deals has enough potential to alter the course of TeraWulf’s history and possibly win newer clients down the road, which makes TeraWulf look very attractive at current levels. I am recommending a Buy rating on TeraWulf, as I explain in the thesis below. What Makes TeraWulf Stand Out In The Rapid Buildout I want to start my analysis of TeraWulf’s prospects with an admission. This recent slate of new deals that markets have witnessed over the past few months in the AI DC (data center) space is extremely intriguing. The structure of these deals has been innovative in the sense that it interlocks partners with common synergies, allowing every stakeholder to progress towards achieving the deal’s eventual objective—delivery of hundreds of megawatts of data center capacity fitted with accelerators. It doesn’t matter if they’re merchant GPUs like NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA ) or custom accelerators like Google’s TPUs. These deals definitely carry some risk due to the size and scale of the deals, which I will explain in a later section. But aside from that, the inventive deal composition definitely does a better job at aligning all stakeholders towards a common goal rather than the typical debt financing that we witnessed during the 90s dot-com bust. That being said, TeraWulf stands out in these deals to turn crypto miners' current infrastructure footprints into powerful DCs that can handle HPC workloads. Let me start by briefly summarizing TeraWulf’s foray into the hypergrowth market for supporting HPC workloads with mission-critical DC infrastructure. So far, a majority of TeraWulf’s $144M worth of TTM revenues comes from mining cryptocurrencies out of its Lake Mariner facility in upstate New York which has a capacity of ~245 MW based on its quarterly filings . The asset utilization rate, when it comes to the revenues generated per MW of infrastructure used, seemed low when the opportunity of serving the AI market presented itself to TeraWulf and its peers. When TeraWulf announced the deal with Core42 last year, they mentioned that they were targeting $1.5M per megawatt hour on a previous quarterly call with investors . That was a significant improvement to the future state of its asset utilization as compared to its crypto mining business. If TeraWulf has hit its milestones from the Core42 deal, it should currently be in the process of delivering 70 MW of turnkey DC infrastructure. So far, TeraWulf has not updated investors on the delivery of the turnkey DC infrastructure to Core42 yet, but that could be announced any time soon. Then, through the last two months, Alphabet’s Google and Neocloud Fluidstack expanded their partnership with TeraWulf, raising the stakes. The expanded partnership accomplished two particular objectives, the second more important than the first. Firstly, TeraWulf reserved the potential to see $6.7B in contracted revenue, with the option of benefiting by another $9.3B if Google/Fluidstack exercised lease extension options. In return, TeraWulf would have to provide ~360 MW of DC capacity at its Lake Mariner campus, which it does not have today. That means it would have to build this from the ground up. But the delivery milestones that TeraWulf had to hit seemed aggressive, with ~40 MW expected to come online in H1 CY26, while the rest of the ~320 MW was expected to come online by H2 CY26. This requires a scale of resources, both technical and financial, that is massive to justify the rapid build-out of the 360 MW of DC capacity for Google/Fluidstack. This can only be supported by meaningfully ramping up financial leverage. Here’s how TeraWulf’s CFO, Patrick Fleury, framed the structure of the deal and reasons for getting financial leverage to build out the capacity: The cost for these data centers is really driven by 2 things. It's driven by design for your specific customer and/or hardware, and then it's driven by schedule. The faster and bigger you are, the more it’s going to cost, because you just have to throw more people [resources] at it. Additionally, he added: Then you go forward to Fluidstack & Google, 450 [megawatts] gross. About 360-ish net [megawatts]. $6.7B of contract value. Core42 was roughly a billion in contract value. Also, a 10-year deal with additional options with Fluidstack and Google could add another $9B of revenue. $15.7B of potential revenue. Google, alongside that deal, is backstopping about $3.2 billion of the lease obligations, which is roughly again, roughly 50% of the $6.7B total over the first 10 years. They are also, in return, taking a 14% stake in the equity. Exhibit A: TeraWulf’s deal with Google and Fluidstack (Company presentation) Unlike the dot-com era debt financing, where vanilla debt was raised by vendors to build out dot-com infrastructure, the recent deals between Google/Fluidstack and TeraWulf involve a complex structure that involves Google backstopping TeraWulf’s funding that it needs to source to finance the 360 MW build-out. Google is also doubling its stake in TeraWulf, now holding ~14% in its indirect vendor, TeraWulf. (I say indirect vendor because Google has a relationship with TeraWulf via Fluidstack) . The “Google Put” in this relationship effectively means Google has cemented its interest in the future prospects of TeraWulf by not only backstopping $3.2B in future lease obligations but also holding 14% of the crypto mining company. Bloomberg said that Terawulf has reportedly already raised $3B in debt to finance their commitments to Google and Fluidstack, which is a positive note in the progress that TeraWulf is making. If TeraWulf pulls off this scale of DC buildout, they would unlock billions in potential revenue to the tune of a minimum of $6.7B spread out over 10 years, which is significant to the future prospects of TeraWulf. Investors should also note that these kinds of partnerships with Core42 and Google/Fluidstack pave the way for TeraWulf to acquire newer clients due to the high-profile nature of the deals. Exhibit B: TeraWulf’s commitments for next year and beyond. (Company presentation) TeraWulf Has Room To Surge Higher I am going to look over current forward-looking revenue multiples of 29x forward revenue (EV/revenue forward) because that is factoring in FY25 revenues of $206M, growing 47% y/y. Analysts are penciling in a near 100% CAGR in revenue growth rates for TeraWulf over the next two years, as seen below. Exhibit C: Revenue estimates for TeraWulf for the next two years. (YCharts) ​​Yet when I compare TeraWulf’s enterprise value of ~$6B versus its FY27 revenues, it indicates a forward revenue multiple of just 7.3x, which is incredibly cheap for TeraWulf. Compare TeraWulf to Iren, another peer that trades at 7.4x FY27 revenues of $2.2B, growing at a CAGR of 41%. Risks & Other Factors To Note Investors may be concerned with share dilution rates, which currently are tracking at a pace of +30% CAGR over the past 2 years, but I believe TeraWulf may have reached peak share dilution rates because of the additional financing TeraWulf is getting from the Google backstop. More importantly, TeraWulf’s shares can be badly hit if its clients suddenly stop spending on TeraWulf’s GPU infrastructure. This is possible if there is a recession or if the end customer demand for AI services starts to drop, pushing customers like Google to rein in spending, impacting TeraWulf. This does pose a meaningful risk to investors, and I would advise investors to invest in TeraWulf based on their risk appetite. Takeaway Google’s involvement in TeraWulf at the investor level and at the financing level is a significant deal for the crypto miner, allowing it to get investment-grade debt, which it can use to build DC capacity for its clients. The revenue opportunity for TeraWulf due to these deals is also significant. I am recommending a Buy rating on TeraWulf.",GOOG|WULF|GOOGL|GOOG:CA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MINING|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-13 17:33:54

53094564,https://invezz.com/?p=2923091,1760377292,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Ethereum price forecast bullish as Tom Lee’s BitMine buys the dip,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/13/ethereum-price-forecast-bullish-as-tom-lees-bitmine-buys-the-dip/,"Ethereum price has recovered sharply after the weekend’s crash, and a major institutional player has taken advantage. BitMine Immersion Technologies, chaired by Tom Lee, has purchased roughly 202,037 ETH , pushing its holdings past 3.03 million ETH. That buying has refocused attention on whether Ethereum’s rebound can turn into a sustained bullish run. BitMine’s ETH acquisition BitMine Immersion Technologies added 202,037 ETH — worth roughly $839 million at current prices — bringing its total holdings to 3.03 million ETH, valued at about $12.6 billion. That represents nearly 2.5% of Ethereum’s entire circulating supply of 120.7 million coins. The purchase follows one of the most volatile weeks in recent crypto history , when Ethereum plunged from $4,500 to as low as $3,430 amid escalating US–China trade tensions. President Trump’s threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods triggered the steep sell-off, wiping out nearly $20 billion in leveraged crypto positions in a single day. BitMine’s timing proved strategic. Chairman Tom Lee said in a statement that the firm saw opportunity where others saw panic, explaining that “volatility creates deleveraging, and this can cause assets to trade at substantial discounts to fundamentals.” The company’s latest purchase pushes it more than halfway toward its goal of acquiring 5% of Ethereum’s total supply, or roughly 6.04 million ETH. Supported by institutional backers such as Ark Invest, Founders Fund, Pantera, and Galaxy Digital, BitMine now stands as the largest Ethereum treasury and the second-largest crypto treasury overall — trailing only Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin-focused Strategy. The firm’s total crypto and cash holdings now exceed $12.9 billion, including 192 BTC worth $22 million, a $135 million stake in Eightco, and $104 million in cash reserves. Technical analysis points to more upside for Ethereum Ethereum has rallied more than 20% from its crash lows near $3,430 to around $4,150 at press time, outperforming Bitcoin’s 0.8% daily gain and leading the broader market’s recovery. The rebound has been fueled by whale accumulation, with large wallets adding roughly 80,000 ETH (worth about $330 million) since October 11, according to Santiment data. This gradual but consistent buying underscores renewed confidence among long-term investors, even as short-term and mid-term holders remain cautious. On the technical front, Ethereum’s price has found strong support around the 50% Fibonacci retracement level near $4,111. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 46.85, suggesting neutral momentum but room for upside if buying continues. The MACD histogram remains slightly negative at -44.48, although its downward slope has begun to flatten, indicating slowing bearish momentum. On the 4-hour chart, Ethereum is forming a “cup” pattern — a classic bullish reversal structure. Source: CoinMarketCap The “cup” pattern formation points to a potential rise toward $4,390, after which a temporary pullback to the $4,070–$3,950 range could occur before the next leg higher. If momentum holds, a clean breakout above $4,390 could open the path toward $4,550 and possibly $4,750 in the short term. What to watch out for as macro and policy risks persist Despite improving sentiment, Ethereum’s path upward may face several macroeconomic hurdles. Investors are watching for the upcoming US Federal Reserve meeting on October 28–29, where potential rate cuts could bolster risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, China’s trade policy remains a key external risk factor. Market volatility surged last week after tariff threats, but subsequent moderation in rhetoric has allowed ETH to stabilise. Beyond macro pressures, Ethereum’s internal developments are also shaping sentiment. The network’s upcoming Fusaka upgrade, scheduled for December 3, has gained traction after successful testnet deployments on Holesky and Sepolia. The update introduces PeerDAS, a data scaling technology expected to boost Ethereum’s data capacity tenfold — potentially strengthening its long-term fundamentals and developer activity. With ETH now trading near $4,150 and exchange reserves down 3.46% over the past week, supply-side pressure continues to ease. As institutional accumulation deepens and technical momentum steadies, Ethereum appears poised to hold above $4,100 and challenge resistance around $4,450. The key test will come later this week with US inflation data, which could set the tone for whether Ethereum’s rebound evolves into a sustained bullish run or faces another round of volatility before the next breakout.

The day’s rotation puts Synthetix in front, with Bittensor and Render following on strong category flows. Price action sets the stage. Synthetix is currently trading near $2.26, up by over 130% in the past 24 hours. Bittensor is now valued at around $416, representing a 30% increase. Render changes hands near $2.87, up by 21%. Exchange data shows rising turnover across all three pairs, confirming participation rather than thin prints. Synthetix (SNX): Perpetuals Launch Track And Crowded Short Covering Synthetix is rallying on concrete steps toward a new perpetual exchange on the Ethereum mainnet. Team communications and product materials outline phased access, pre-deposits, and a dated trading competition with $1M in rewards. Synthetix is launching the first perp DEX on Ethereum mainnet To battle test our DEX ahead of launch, we will be running a trading competition featuring a roster of the biggest & best traders in the industry The winner will take home $1,000,000 https://t.co/7TWS3tsJhp — Synthetix (@synthetix_io) September 22, 2025 The package includes gas-free execution mechanics, multi-collateral margin, and an off-chain matching layer that settles on the mainnet. Traders view this as a near-term utility boost that can convert attention into activity. Order books show heavy bidding through prior resistance levels. Derivatives screens indicate a jump in open interest and a shift in funding after shorts crowded the range earlier this week. That shift aligns with the break of multi-month trend lines on spot charts. Put simply, a dated launch path, combined with a technical trigger, drew both systematic and discretionary buyers simultaneously. Sustainability hinges on follow-through. Analysts are watching to see whether volumes remain high after the initial burst and whether enrollment in the competition tracks with the early sign-ups. Another marker is breadth across venues. If spreads stay tight and depth improves on secondary exchanges, the move can carry beyond a single session. Bittensor (TAO): AI Basket Strength And Clean Levels Bittensor’s advance arrives on a green day for AI-linked tokens. Category trackers show steady inflows into data and compute plays, and TAO often absorbs that flow due to its relative depth. Bittensor Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) Price reclaimed a key support area last week and pushed above a cluster around the low 300s, which opened up room toward the mid-400s on many technical maps. Intraday readings show constructive funding and firm spot volumes. That mix suggests the move is not only leveraged in a directional sense but also cash buyers rebuilding their exposure to the AI theme. For confirmation, traders want to see TAO hold above reclaimed levels into the close and add to open interest without sharp funding spikes. Render (RENDER): Compute Demand And Venue Breadth Render is rising on renewed interest in GPU-backed compute and DePIN narratives. Activity screens show more consistent volumes across top pairs, while short-term charts indicate a reclaim of a resistance band that capped attempts earlier this month. Options and perps positioning point to measured leverage rather than blowout risk, which often produces steadier climbs during altcoin season. Desk chatter also notes improved market depth following recent venue enhancements. If spot volumes continue to expand and the token holds above today’s breakout zone, RNDR can keep pace with the broader compute basket. Altcoin Season Read Today’s rotation is anchored by clear trends . Synthetix has a dated mainnet rollout for perpetuals and an active competition that channels flows. Bittensor benefits from AI category strength and a clean chart reclaim. Render participates through improving venue breadth and persistent interest in computing. The checklist from here is simple. Watch SNX volumes, competition enrollment, and delivery cadence on the launch path. Track TAO’s hold above reclaimed levels while AI screens stay green. Monitor RNDR’s spot depth and whether the breakout band turns into support. If these markers persist, this pocket of altcoin season can extend into the following sessions.

Is It Justified?,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4829573-zcash-is-going-parabolic-is-it-justified?utm_source=cryptocompare.com&utm_medium=referral&feed_item_type=article,"Summary Zcash (ZEC-USD) has surged over 300% YTD, outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum since 2023, with renewed interest in privacy coins. ZEC's fundamentals show strong growth in transferred value and shielded pool supply, but daily active addresses remain low compared to peers. Despite a 16.5% discount on Grayscale Zcash Trust (ZCSH), caution is advised due to thin trading and an extended rally in ZEC's price. Current sentiment and high MVRV suggest ZEC is overextended; consider adding on corrections rather than chasing after the recent surge. If you bought shares in the Grayscale Zcash Trust ( ZCSH ) when I first wrote about it three and half years ago, congrats, you're finally ahead. Not only is Zcash ( ZEC-USD ) up over 300% year to date, but it's actually even now beating both Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) since the start of 2023: Data by YCharts As someone who has been a large advocate for Zcash here on Seeking Alpha, this is a joy to watch. It's been a long time coming and it's great seeing Zcash get its moment after it looked left for dead early last year. The optimist in me would love to believe we're observing a broad awakening to surveillance tech and the renaissance of digital privacy. The cynic in me can't help but notice Zcash has pumped, in part, due to notable crypto KOLs posting about it more on places like X. So in this article, we'll do what I typically try to do with Digital Assets; we'll look at the fundamentals. Zcash Network Activity With the recent surge in ZEC's price from just $40 per coin as recently as September to just under $300 on October 11th, the coin itself has rocketed up to the 28th largest digital asset according to CoinMarketCap: CryptoCap Rank: 28 Total Supply: 21 million Circulating Supply: 16.3 million (77%) Fully Diluted cap: $5.6 billion What once looked like a lost battle with privacy coin peer Monero ( XMR-USD ) is now a competition once again with ZEC now being within just a $100 million of XMR from a fully diluted cap perspective. However, XMR is notably different in that it is private by default, where Zcash has both transparent and private capability. Given Monero's privacy level, comparative data in this piece will be limited between those two projects. What we can show is transactions: 30 Day Avg Tx 12/31/24 10/12/25 YTD Litecoin ( LTC-USD ) 199.0 190.2 -4.4% Monero 26.4 26.6 0.8% Dash ( DASH-USD ) 17.5 19.3 10.3% Zcash 1.3 3.1 138.5% Source: Coinmetrics, Analyst's calculations, numbers in 000s And while Zcash has indeed seen the best year to date transactions growth compared with peer assets, the reality is that growth is coming from a minuscule starting point of just 1.3k average daily transactions at the start of the year. I'm showing metrics for both Dash and Litecoin as well because each of them are also proof-of-work, payment-focused coins that have some degree of optional privacy enabled on-chain. 30 Day Average DAAs (CoinMetrics) I think the chart above shows just how little Zcash has been able to keep up with other networks that serve a similar purpose. While ZEC once had more daily active addresses than privacy-peer DASH, for the entirety of the current post-Crypto Winter cycle DASH has had several multiples more DAAs than ZEC. And both are well below that of LTC. Transferred Value (Coinmetrics) Where we are clearly seeing a jump for Zcash is in dollar-denominated transferred value. After averaging less than $3 million in transferred value per day during the month of August, Zcash started to pull away from DASH in September and has exploded up to $57 million as of article submission. Importantly, these numbers reflect a 30 Day moving average. Looking at the raw daily numbers puts ZEC currently on par with LTC. On October 11th, Zcash processed over $312 million in USD-transferred value - more than Litecoin and Dash combined on that specific day. And it's fairly clear where that ZEC is going: Shielded Pool ZEC (Blockchair) Since the beginning of the year, Shielded Pool ZEC has more than doubled in supply from roughly 2 million coins to just under 4.5 million coins as of October 12th. This means that over 27% of circulating ZEC is now in the privacy pool - this greatly enhances the privacy of the network and is a sign that Zcash is potentially being used for its original intention. Still, there are reasons for caution at this juncture. Zcash Risks: Valuation and Sentiment There is no doubt that at least some degree of Zcash's price performance is due to influential cryptocurrency investors and thought leaders talking about it online. The search interest for Zcash has surpassed anything we've witnessed in the last five years: Search Term:""zcash"" (Google Trends) Google Trends search term interest over time for 'zcash' is currently at 100. At no point in the last five years had it ever eclipsed 60 previously. This suggests a staggering level of interest in Zcash currently. It's important to be mindful of the idea that when everyone is looking for it and talking about it, there is probably a signal to consider. Valuation-wise, I often look at NVT ratio for PoW coins like ZEC, LTC, and DASH. The reason is because it gives us a ratio for the value of the coins relative to the USD-denominated transferred value over the network. Given ZEC's massive rise in transferred value, its NVT ratio has actually come down considerably even as the price of the coin has rallied strongly: 30 Day NVT Ratio (Coinmetrics) At a 30 Day average NVT ratio of 106, ZEC is cheaper than DASH again for the first time in roughly a year and is now well below its NVT ratio high of 400 earlier this year. Judging ZEC based on its market value to realized value multiple tells a different story, however: MVRV ratio (Coinmetrics) ZEC's MVRV multiple nearly hit 2.5 on October 11th and is still well above 2 as of article submission. ZEC's MVRV is still higher than its peak from the prior crypto bull cycle. And there is one more thing to consider; anecdotally, the 'privacy narrative' is typically an indicator of late-cycle behavior. While it could certainly be different this time, I'd personally be very careful chasing Zcash or ZCSH shares after such a strong rally. Grayscale Fund Shares ZCSH ZEC Per Share 0.08194538 Zcash Price $245 Share value $20.08 Share price $16.75 Discount Rate 16.57% Source: Grayscale, Analyst's Calculations Given a choice between adding one or the other today, you could actually talk me into shares of ZCSH at a 16.5% discount. However, I'd be very careful regarding position sizing. ZCSH is thinly traded and it could be hard to get out of the position at the price you might want. For full disclosure, I held ZCSH shares during the recent rally and exited that position late last week in spite of the discount. Closing Thoughts I think the ZEC rally is quite extended at this point based purely on technicals. Sentiment in the project has clearly changed judging by the search interest and the surge in shielded pool supply. Fundamentally, there are some positive signs as well with NVT ratio coming down due to surging transferred value even as the coin price moons. ZEC's transparent DAA metrics are still quite low. So I do have some concern about how sustainable this rally actually actually is. It could simply be a case of larger crypto holders choosing ZEC to shield assets rather than a broad base of smaller crypto holders actually using the network. That remains to be seen. MVRV is also extremely high at 2.2 and that level is usually a sign that price is due for a correction. All of this stated, I still hold ZEC and think it's a terrific project to support. I would not chase the asset at this point in time. But it's definitely one to consider adding to if/when this crypto cycle turns bearish.",ZCSH|ZEC-USD,EN,0,0,ZEC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|LTC|DASH,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-13 17:48:32

The popular meme coin, often known for its dramatic price surges, is displaying technical signals that mirror previous breakout phases. With momentum quietly building, investors are wondering if Dogecoin’s next big rally is just around the corner. History Repeats: Dogecoin Flashes Familiar Pre-Rally Signals Crypto analyst EtherNasyonaL, in a recent post, highlighted that Dogecoin appears to be repeating one of its most reliable historical setups. Each of Dogecoin’s major rallies has been preceded by a familiar sequence of technical signals, persistence above the 25-day moving average (25MA), a breakout from a long-term descending trendline, and a subsequent retest phase that sets the stage for a new bullish cycle. Related Reading: Is The Dogecoin Low In? Analyst Charts Path To $0.60 According to the analyst, these structural markers have consistently acted as precursors to Dogecoin’s explosive moves. Whenever the price maintained strength above the 25MA after a prolonged downtrend, it often indicated that sellers had exhausted their momentum and buyers were quietly regaining control. This recurring pattern has served as a reliable indicator of an impending shift in market direction. Currently, the chart once again reflects the same behavior. Dogecoin’s price has moved above the 25MA, signaling renewed upward strength, while the downtrend has been decisively broken. The asset is now in the retest phase, a critical point where market confirmation typically occurs before momentum accelerates. This structural repetition suggests that Dogecoin may be preparing for its next major move. EtherNasyonaL also noted that this phase often coincides with widespread market doubt and bearish sentiment. Historically, the “NGMI” (Not Gonna Make It) feeling tends to dominate just before Dogecoin begins a parabolic rally. Such pessimism often reflects capitulation among retail traders, while larger players quietly accumulate positions in anticipation of the next breakout. If history repeats, the ongoing consolidation could mark the calm before the next significant surge, a reminder that market doubt often precedes Dogecoin’s most powerful upward moves. Bullish Pennant Emerges After Market Downturn Trader Tardigrade, in a recent 4-hour chart analysis shared on X, highlighted that Dogecoin is beginning to display a fresh bullish setup following the recent market downturn. Despite the crash, the memecoin is stabilizing and carving out a constructive structure that could signal renewed buyer interest. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Dogecoin Price Is ‘Parabolic Coded’ To $1, Here’s What It Means According to Trader Tardigrade, a Bullish Pennant pattern has emerged on the chart, a formation that typically develops after a sharp move upward, followed by a period of consolidation.

Here’s What You Need to Know,https://timestabloid.com/updated-xrp-supply-breakdown-heres-what-you-need-to-know/,"The XRP ecosystem is tightening in ways that could significantly influence liquidity, price action, and institutional interest . As the market evolves, understanding where every XRP token sits—whether circulating, locked, or burned—has become essential for investors and analysts alike. Recent data from SBI Holdings’ FY2025 report, shared by market analyst Xaif on X, reveals the latest and most accurate distribution figures for XRP, shedding light on Ripple’s remaining escrow holdings and the circulating supply currently driving market momentum. The Latest Numbers From SBI Holdings According to the updated report, XRP’s maximum supply remains fixed at 100 billion tokens. Of this total, approximately 59.24 billion XRP are now circulating in the market, contributing to an estimated market capitalization of about ¥28.6 trillion. Roughly 10 million XRP have been permanently burned over time as transaction fees on the XRP Ledger, effectively removing them from the total supply. Ripple’s non-circulating holdings—tokens not yet available to the open market—amount to about 4.85 billion XRP, valued at around ¥13.4 trillion as of the end of March 2025. Updated XRP Supply Breakdown (SBI Holdings FY Report) Only ~35B XRP remain locked in Ripple escrow to date Circulating supply tightening fast pic.twitter.com/5fHOQ7mD2k — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) October 13, 2025 However, the most crucial figure in the updated breakdown concerns Ripple’s escrow balance, which currently holds approximately 35.9 billion XRP. This figure confirms that only about 35 billion XRP remain locked in escrow to date, reflecting ongoing monthly releases and sales that have gradually tightened XRP’s circulating supply. Why Escrow Lockup Matters The XRP escrow mechanism is a fundamental supply control feature built into the XRP Ledger. Tokens placed in escrow are inaccessible to Ripple until specific conditions or timeframes are met, preventing arbitrary selling and protecting market stability. As SBI’s report highlights, nearly 40% of the total XRP supply remains in escrow, meaning Ripple cannot freely sell or transfer these tokens at will. This mechanism has significant implications for XRP’s market behavior: as fewer tokens become available for trading, liquidity can tighten, potentially amplifying price movements during periods of high demand. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Impact on Market Liquidity With over 59 billion XRP circulating and the rest locked or burned, XRP’s available float is substantially smaller than its total supply suggests. This has two important market effects. First, reduced circulating supply can heighten volatility—sharp demand spikes or institutional buys can move prices more aggressively when liquidity is constrained. Second, for long-term holders and enterprise users of the XRP Ledger, a tightening float enhances scarcity value, especially as more XRP becomes utilized in cross-border settlements and on-chain payment infrastructure. A Strategic Moment for XRP Investors Xaif’s coverage of SBI Holdings’ updated figures has reignited discussion about XRP’s long-term tokenomics and the implications of a shrinking available supply. For traders, the message is clear: the structural liquidity of XRP is evolving rapidly. As the escrow balance continues to decline with each monthly release, circulating XRP is becoming more scarce, and the asset’s dynamics are shifting toward tighter, potentially more bullish conditions. In summary, the Updated XRP Supply Breakdown from SBI Holdings provides the clearest picture yet of XRP’s current distribution. With nearly 40% of tokens locked and a gradually shrinking tradable float, the XRP market is entering a new phase—one where supply pressure could become a defining force in price discovery and investor strategy moving forward.

Analysts Carl Quintanilla and Frank Cappelleri pointed to a recurring pattern in Bitcoin’s chart: periods of consolidation followed by sharp fourth-quarter rallies. With Bitcoin expected to “go much higher” in the next three months, the stage may be set for one of crypto’s strongest finishes to a year in recent memory. Historically, a strong Bitcoin rally has served as the catalyst for the broader altcoin season, as capital flows from BTC into high-upside, smaller-cap tokens. This time, many investors are betting that the biggest winner won’t be an existing blue-chip crypto, but rather Little Pepe (LILPEPE) , a presale project rapidly gaining traction as the next big meme infrastructure play on Ethereum. Why Bitcoin’s Rally Could Supercharge LILPEPE Whenever Bitcoin rallies, investor confidence across the market surges. Historically, BTC bull runs have triggered massive capital rotation into meme coins and new projects seeking exponential growth. During previous cycles, meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) saw 100x to 1000x runs immediately after Bitcoin broke key resistance levels. If CNBC’s projection holds, and Bitcoin indeed enters a full fourth-quarter extension phase, speculative capital is likely to pour into emerging tokens with strong communities and viral potential. That’s where Little Pepe stands out. One of the fastest-growing presales of 2025, LILPEPE raised $26.8 million at its Stage 13 price of $0.0022, selling 16.3 billion tokens and filling 94.8% of the allocation. While its targeted debut price of $0.0030 promises early investors a 36% upside before listings, analysts predict the idea might rocket much higher once Bitcoin and retail interest peak. What Makes LILPEPE So Promising? Little Pepe isn’t just another meme token riding hype; it’s building real blockchain infrastructure around meme culture. The project is developing a Layer-2 EVM chain tailored for meme tokens, with: Zero buy/sell tax for frictionless trading Anti-sniper bot protection to ensure fair launches A Meme Launchpad where future meme projects will build and launch directly on its chain This positions Little Pepe as the Ethereum of memes, a Layer-2 ecosystem where meme creators, traders, and communities can thrive without the typical gas fees and security concerns. The project’s Tokenomics also reflects sustainability and growth: Total Supply: 100 billion LILPEPE 26.5% Presale | 30% Chain Reserves | 13.5% Staking & Rewards 10% each for Marketing, Liquidity, and CEX/DEX Reserves With 0% transaction tax, a CertiK audit, and a CoinMarketCap listing, LILPEPE is not just another speculative coin; it’s a hybrid of utility, community, and culture. Community-Driven Momentum and Giveaways Beyond tokenomics, LILPEPE’s team has kept community engagement at the heart of its strategy. Two major campaigns are fueling growth: A $777,000 Giveaway , where 10 winners each receive $77,000 in tokens. A 15 ETH Mega Giveaway, rewarding top presale buyers between Stages 12–17. These events have attracted thousands of participants, driving visibility and excitement as the presale nears completion. Analyst Predictions: Why LILPEPE Could 100x Today, crypto specialists consider LILPEPE one of the most promising meme projects for 2026. Its unique ecosystem model and significant community traction predict that if the token reaches a $2.5 billion market cap post-launch, its price might approach $2.50, a 100x gain from presale levels. Significantly, CNBC's predicted Bitcoin gain will create an optimal economic backdrop for exponential growth. Investors seek higher returns in altcoins after Bitcoin's surge, and meme currencies like LILPEPE benefit the most. Final Thoughts As CNBC’s experts predict a major Bitcoin moonshot in Q4, history suggests that meme coins and presale projects could be the biggest winners of the cycle. Among them, Little Pepe (LILPEPE) stands out for blending meme culture with Layer-2 innovation, a rare combination of narrative power and practical utility. With presale nearly sold out and a launch price on the horizon, LILPEPE could emerge as the best crypto to buy now, the meme project that rides Bitcoin’s bullish wave into 2026’s biggest rally.

Few assets embody that volatility more than XRP — a token that has recently endured a wave of liquidation yet still holds the technical structure for a potentially explosive move. According to prominent analyst Cryptoinsightuk, recent Fibonacci projections suggest XRP’s next major leg could propel prices into the $8 to $12 range, marking what he believes will be a decisive phase of the asset’s current market cycle. The Technical Case: Fibonacci Extensions Point Higher At the heart of Cryptoinsightuk’s thesis is a Fibonacci extension analysis drawn from XRP’s most recent corrective structure. By mapping the swing low of the recent sell-off to the preceding rally, the chart displays clear extension targets consistent with a renewed impulsive wave. On both Coinbase and Binance charts, the 4.236 Fibonacci extension — a level historically associated with the terminal phase of strong uptrends — aligns near the $8–$12 price zone. I've given you my case as to why I think $XRP 's next leg takes us out to $8.00 – $12.00. This is the area I've said I'll deleverage heavily. Isn't it funny looking at this recent liquidation event and throwing a fib on there to see where the price would take us to if we see a… pic.twitter.com/qBt2wclIIl — Cryptoinsightuk (@Cryptoinsightuk) October 13, 2025 This confluence is not arbitrary. The structure mirrors prior XRP rallies where deep retracements preceded multi-thousand-percent surges. With market sentiment currently rebuilding after weeks of consolidation, the technical picture implies a potential breakout setup similar to previous pre-rally formations. Market Reset: The Aftermath of a Massive Liquidation Before any new leg higher, the market needed a reset — and it got one. Last week, XRP experienced one of its largest liquidation events in recent history , erasing over $700 million in leveraged positions across exchanges. Prices plunged rapidly before stabilizing around the $1.60 region, setting the stage for a healthier rebound. Analysts describe such events as “cleansing moments” in crypto markets, flushing out excessive leverage and restoring balance between buyers and sellers. Since then, XRP has regained momentum, currently trading around $2.58 with rising spot volume and a rebound in market depth. This purge of speculative positions has given bulls a cleaner slate — one that may now support the kind of sustained move the Fibonacci structure suggests. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Chart Alignment Across Exchanges: Coinbase and Binance One of the most compelling aspects of Cryptoinsightuk’s analysis is the cross-exchange confirmation of his technical setup. Both Coinbase and Binance daily charts display nearly identical swing points and extension levels. This symmetry reinforces the reliability of the projection, reducing the risk that the bullish pattern is an isolated artifact of a single platform’s data. The overlapping 4.236 extensions across exchanges suggest market-wide agreement in the underlying price structure. In other words, XRP’s path toward $8–$12 would not rely on local anomalies — it’s a formation that reflects the collective sentiment and technical balance of the global XRP market. Conditions for Validation and Profit-Taking Strategy Cryptoinsightuk has also outlined his own deleveraging plan — he intends to scale out of his position heavily within the $8–$12 zone, viewing it as a potential macro top area. However, before such targets can be validated, XRP must close decisively above the $3.10–$3.70 resistance band, reclaim lost momentum on the daily RSI, and sustain rising volume through the breakout phase. Failure to hold those breakout levels or renewed risk aversion in broader markets could invalidate the setup, leading to renewed declines toward lower supports near $1.80. As with any parabolic projection, position management remains critical. From Liquidation to Liftoff Cryptoinsightuk’s projection is not mere speculation — it’s a disciplined application of technical mathematics to a volatile but structured market. The $8–$12 XRP target is rooted in Fibonacci symmetry, not hype, and supported by post-liquidation reaccumulation signals. If XRP can convert recent pain into momentum, the stage is set for one of its most dramatic runs in years. Whether the market fulfills that projection remains to be seen, but one thing is clear — the next leg for XRP could be as breathtaking as its history suggests.

Key levels support holds at $17.26, with resistance at $19.66 likely to define the next breakout move. A bullish setup, characterized by steady higher lows and consolidation near $19.50, suggests continued buyer control and potential for further gains. On October 13, 2025, Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $19.58, marking a 12.16% increase in the past 24 hours, as bullish sentiment strengthens across the market. The latest surge reflects growing investor confidence in the project’s long-term fundamentals and consistent ecosystem expansion. LINK’s steady climb above $19 has encouraged momentum traders, who now anticipate a sustained push toward higher levels if current market conditions persist. Chainlink 1-day price chart: LINK building momentum above key levels On the daily timeframe, LINK displays a robust uptrend structure with price action firmly above the $17.26 support zone. Buyers have successfully defended this level, confirming it as a strong foundation for the ongoing bullish advance. The asset now faces immediate resistance at $19.66, where short-term profit-taking could briefly slow momentum before another attempt to break higher. Sustained price action above $19.50 could trigger a new phase of buying interest targeting the $20.00 psychological level. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView From a technical standpoint, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is approaching the overbought territory but still shows room for upside continuation. The MACD remains bullish, with the signal line well below the MACD line, confirming the presence of positive market momentum. The 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) continues to act as dynamic support, indicating that short-term traders are following the trend rather than fading it. A close above $19.66 would confirm the breakout, while any retracement toward $18.00–$17.50 could offer new entry opportunities for bullish participants if buying pressure holds steady. Chainlink 4-hour price chart: LINK short-term strength and resistance retest On the 4-hour chart, LINK maintains a clear pattern of higher highs and higher lows, reinforcing the prevailing bullish structure. The token is currently consolidating around $19.50, suggesting a potential accumulation phase before another breakout attempt. Bulls are showing resilience in defending this level, reflecting ongoing demand in lower timeframes. LINK/USDT Chart: TradingView The RSI remains above 50, indicating strong buying interest without signs of exhaustion, while the MACD histogram continues to print positive values, confirming ongoing short-term bullish pressure. A decisive break above $19.66, accompanied by substantial volume, could propel LINK toward $20.50. Conversely, failure to maintain above $19.00 may lead to a minor pullback toward $18.20, followed by renewed upward movement.

Chainlink’s current price structure points toward sustained bullish momentum if market conditions remain favorable. With strong support established at $17.26 and consolidation holding around $19.50, buyers appear to be preparing for a possible breakout above the $19.66 resistance level. A successful close above this threshold could open the path toward the $20.00–$20.50 range in the short term, signaling the continuation of LINK’s upward trajectory. However, if the price fails to maintain strength above $19.00, a short-lived correction could occur, potentially driving LINK back toward the $18.20–$17.50 area before buyers step in again. Overall, the current market tone remains positive, and Chainlink’s trend structure continues to favor bulls, with traders closely watching for a decisive move above resistance to confirm further gains. Is Chainlink a good investment? Chainlink remains one of the strongest utility-driven projects in the crypto market, powering smart contracts with reliable real-world data through its decentralized oracle network. Its growing integrations across major blockchains and expanding DeFi partnerships reinforce long-term value and adoption. With strong fundamentals, active development, and rising staking participation, LINK continues to attract both institutional and retail interest. However, price movements remain tied to broader market conditions, so a medium- to long-term approach is advisable. Overall, Chainlink stands out as a credible investment option for those seeking exposure to utility-based blockchain assets. Why is the LINK price up today? LINK’s 12.16% surge is driven by renewed market confidence and strong buying momentum above $19.00. Traders are positioning for a breakout as the token holds firm above the $17.26 support level, signaling sustained bullish sentiment. Growing demand for Chainlink’s oracle technology and expanding DeFi integrations have boosted investor interest. Combined with solid technical structure and rising on-chain activity, these factors are fueling today’s price rally toward the $19.66 resistance zone. Recent news In October 2025, Plasma, a layer-1 blockchain focused on stablecoin infrastructure, integrated Chainlink’s services through the SCALE program to enhance its oracle, data, and cross-chain capabilities.

In 2019, LINK had substantial growth, reaching $1 in May and peaking around $3 by year-end, driven by its utility in providing reliable data feeds for smart contracts. 2020 marked a breakout year as LINK surged from $2 to $20 by August, fueled by DeFi demand. In 2021, it reached an all-time high of around $52 in May but dropped to $22 by mid-year due to market volatility. In 2022, LINK ranged between $15 and $25 amid broader market corrections. In 2023, it further declined, stabilizing in the $6 to $13 range as investor sentiment cooled. Starting 2024 at $15, LINK briefly spiked to $18 in February before falling to $12 by April. The coin’s price has fluctuated throughout 2024, peaking near $15 in May, dropping to around $10 by August, and stabilizing between $10 and $12.28 in October. In November, LINK is trading within the range of $10.68 to $11.94. In December, LINK maintained a range of $18.43 to $30.94. In January 2025, Chainlink peaked at $ 22.90 but lost momentum towards the end of the month, leading to a trading range of $19.20-$21.00 in February. In March 2025, Chainlink (LINK) experienced a strong upward trend, starting at approximately $13.73 and steadily rising to $16.02, with periods of volatility. In April, Chainlink (LINK) showed relatively stable price movement, fluctuating between $10.7 and $15.3, indicating volatility within a broad trading range. In May, Chainlink (LINK) began trading at approximately $14.20 and experienced some price fluctuations, dipping to a low of $13.90.

According to analysts, although the Fed will continue to cut interest rates throughout 2025, market expectations for a rate cut in 2026 may decrease if economic growth remains strong and productivity growth exceeds expectations. The report stated, “Markets are currently pricing in a rate cut of approximately 63 basis points in 2026. However, if the US economy remains strong and productivity growth continues, these expectations may gradually be eroded. This will support US bond yields and the dollar upwards.” Related News: Was the Whale Who Shorted Before Donald Trump's Tariff Announcement His Son Barron Trump?

The pledge to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese imports sparked panic selling, forcing more than $19 billion in leveraged crypto positions to unwind in just 24 hours. Data from Coinglass shows that over 1.6 million traders were liquidated, with nearly 87% of positions being long. The event marked a rare moment where macro policy news spilled directly into digital asset markets, erasing billions in open interest within hours and pushing Bitcoin below $105,000 before a rapid rebound took shape. Leverage Unwinds After Tariff Announcement The crash exposed the scale of leverage still built into crypto’s trading structure. Bitcoin and Ethereum led losses, while altcoins saw even deeper corrections as automated margin calls intensified the decline. Analysts stated that the majority of liquidations occurred on high-frequency derivatives platforms, including Binance, OKX, and Bybit. In each case, futures contracts tied to major assets were hit by forced liquidations that drained liquidity from the books and accelerated the price drop. Data indicated that open interest in Bitcoin futures fell by more than 30% during the selloff, resetting leverage to levels last seen in May. This mechanical clearing, while severe, also relieved excess positioning that had built up through September’s rally. Funding rates turned negative across most exchanges, indicating that sentiment had flipped from speculative optimism to caution. Traders described the event as a “stress test” for market structure, revealing both the growing role of derivatives and the limits of algorithmic risk management during sudden volatility. ""It is impossible to believe that China would have taken such an action, but they have, and the rest is History. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" – President Donald J. Trump pic.twitter.com/Kx6deI2voC — The White House (@WhiteHouse) October 10, 2025 Crypto Rebound Shows Residual Strength By October 13, Bitcoin had climbed back above $114,000 , recovering nearly 12% from the weekend’s lows, while Ethereum rose to around $4,100. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $420 million in inflows during the recovery phase, helping to absorb selling pressure and providing a partial floor for prices. Altcoins also stabilized , though at reduced volumes. Solana, XRP, and Avalanche all posted modest rebounds, reflecting selective risk appetite rather than a full recovery. Market participants attributed the bounce to dip-buying by institutional desks and automated market makers rebuilding liquidity after widespread liquidations. Despite the recovery, volatility remains elevated. Implied volatility in Bitcoin options has risen above 50%, and futures spreads remain compressed, suggesting caution among professional traders. Analysts warn that a repeat of rapid leverage buildup could trigger another similar unwind if macro conditions deteriorate further. Macro Shock and Crypto’s Fragile Leverage The tariff-driven selloff demonstrated how closely cryptocurrency now tracks macroeconomic risk. Once considered insulated from traditional policy moves, digital assets are now deeply entwined with global liquidity cycles and investor positioning. The scale of the liquidation also raised new questions about how exchanges manage leverage. Some industry observers argue for stricter margin caps or more transparent liquidation mechanisms to prevent cascading failures. Others suggest the market’s self-correction was necessary—a painful but cleansing process that restores balance after months of unchecked leverage. For now, Bitcoin’s swift rebound offers temporary reassurance. But the episode leaves a clear reminder: when leverage meets macro volatility, even a policy headline can rewrite the market’s balance within hours.

Biswarup Chatterjee, the bank’s global head of partnerships and innovation, said the project is moving forward as Wall Street deepens its involvement in crypto. “We have various kinds of explorations,” Chatterjee said, adding that Citi aims to deliver “a credible custody solution” for asset managers and institutional clients within the next few quarters. The project represents one of Citi’s biggest blockchain-related undertakings so far. Traditional banks had long kept their distance from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other tokens, but things have started to change under President Donald Trump’s administration, which has pushed for clearer digital asset regulations. The GENIUS Act, introduced earlier this year, created a friendlier environment for banks looking to handle stablecoins and other blockchain-based assets, encouraging players like Citi to move forward with crypto-linked services. Citi develops its custody system while weighing partnerships According to CNBC, Chatterjee confirmed that Citi’s upcoming platform will hold native cryptocurrencies on behalf of clients, rather than rely on external exchanges or third-party platforms. That’s a significant decision, given that crypto custody carries security risks including cyberattacks and theft. But Citi sees opportunity in its own heavily regulated structure, which already has decades of experience managing traditional asset custody for global clients. Chatterjee said the bank is testing multiple models for the service, some built in-house, others created through partnerships. “We may have certain solutions that are completely designed and built in-house that are targeted towards certain assets and certain segments of our clients,” he explained. “Whereas we may use a third-party, lightweight, nimble solution for other kind of assets.” He also made it clear that Citi is keeping its options open: “We’re not currently ruling out anything.” While Citi moves forward, not every Wall Street name is jumping in. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan, said earlier this year that his bank would allow clients to purchase crypto but would not act as a custodian. That puts Citi in a smaller group of traditional institutions exploring full-scale crypto custody rather than stopping at token transactions. Citi expands into stablecoin experiments amid industry competition Beyond custody, Chatterjee said stablecoins could help clients doing business in countries where traditional banking and payment systems are weak. “We do recognize the fact that there are these pockets in the world where you have a commercial need from our clients to be there and do business,” he said. Citi already operates Citi Token Services , a system that lets customers move funds across borders instantly using blockchain infrastructure. The platform competes with JPMorgan’s deposit token, which also runs on the Ethereum network and allows 24/7 movement of money. These systems represent a growing push by big U.S. banks to modernize cross-border transactions through blockchain while keeping compliance intact. Recently, Citi invested in BVNK, a company that builds stablecoin infrastructure. Still, Chatterjee described the effort as being “in the early stages of stablecoin exploration.” Meanwhile, Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan said in July that his firm is also developing its own stablecoin project, and Scott Lucas, global head of markets digital assets at JPMorgan, said the company is “exploring” the digital currency space too. “There’s a real opportunity for us to think about how we can offer different services for our clients on the cash side,” Lucas said, “as well as responding to client demand to do things on stablecoins. And that strategy is still emerging, as you can understand, because it’s only really been a few months since we’ve had some more clear regulation around what the opportunity looks like.” Join Bybit now and claim a $50 bonus in minutes",News|Citigroup,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-13 19:20:41

The move marks another step by the Wall Street bank into the digital asset space. Biswarup Chatterjee, Citi’s global head of partnerships and innovation for services, said the custody solution has been in development for two to three years. “We have various kinds of explorations,” Chatterjee told CNBC. “We’re hoping that in the next few quarters, we can come to market with a credible custody solution that we can offer to our asset managers and other clients.” The custody plan would give institutional clients a regulated way to store crypto, a piece of infrastructure many traditional investors view as essential for exposure to the sector. Chatterjee said Citi is pursuing a hybrid approach, developing some custody tools internally while also exploring outside partnerships. “We may have certain solutions that are completely designed and built in-house … whereas we may use a third-party, lightweight, nimble solution for other kinds of assets,” he said. “We’re not currently ruling out anything.” The custody offering would join a growing portfolio of digital asset experiments at Citi. During the bank’s second-quarter earnings call in July, CEO Jane Fraser said Citi is also exploring a stablecoin issuance , though she noted that tokenized deposits are a more immediate focus. Last week, Citi Ventures invested in BVNK , a stablecoin payments startup, alongside Visa. That deal followed earlier experiments in blockchain-based trade finance and cross-border payments.

Its trading volume rose by 14.86% over the same period. Looking back, ARB had a steep decline last week, which saw it register its lowest price since launch at $0.136. ARB 1-day chart analysis ARBUSD chart by TradingView ARB has support at $0.30 after breaking below critical support levels at $0.41, which saw it register a new all-time low price.

ARB is caught in a broader risk-off rotation. However, Ethereum L2s like Mantle (+31% on Oct 13) show resilience, suggesting ARB’s underperformance is partly chain-specific. Why is ARB down? ARB’s decline reflects a mix of technical breakdowns while ecosystem developments like VanEck’s ETF provide long-term upside; near-term risks dominate. Recent news SWIFT announced its blockchain will use Linea (Ethereum L2), challenging Arbitrum’s dominance in institutional adoption. Linea’s TVL ($2.27B) now ranks fourth among L2s. Does Arbitrum have a future? A high adoption rate is crucial for any blockchain’s long-term success and sustainability. Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines. Is Arbitrum good to buy? Arbitrum is trading at its lowest range this year, with the charts showing it is just above the oversold region. At current prices, ARB is undervalued and is likely to recover if market sentiment changes. On the other hand, the Arbitrum ecosystem’s total value locked has crossed above $2.5 billion, indicating solid utility in decentralized finance. Is Arbitrum a good investment? SkyEcosystem’s Risk Analysis has launched USDS stablecoin on Arbitrum, expanding Arbitrum’s utility, which will attract liquidity to the network. This integration could increase ARB usage, potentially boosting its price. Will Arbitrum reach $10? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, ARB is unlikely to reach $10 before 2031. Can Arbitrum reach 100 dollars? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $100 in the period ending in 2031. Will Arbitrum reach $1,000? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, it is unlikely that ARB will trade at $1,000 in the period ending in 2031. Does Arbitrum have a good long-term future? A high adoption rate is crucial for any blockchain’s long-term success and sustainability. Arbitrum’s performance in this regard is a positive sign of its future performance despite the price declines.

The company, which already holds the world’s largest Ethereum treasury, stated that the acquisition added 202,037 ETH to its reserves, bringing its total to 3,032,188 ETH, approximately 2.5% of Ethereum’s circulating supply. The aggressive buying spree came amid a weekend market sell-off that saw more than $19 billion in leveraged positions liquidated . Over 1.66 million crypto traders were liquidated as the market experienced a sharp downturn, wiping out $19.33 billion in positions. #Trump #Bitcoin https://t.co/7PNRagvFrx — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 11, 2025 Over 1.6 million traders were wiped out in 24 hours, according to CoinGlass data , as Bitcoin and Ethereum recorded $5.38 billion and $4.43 billion in long liquidations, respectively. The broader market’s total capitalization dropped by over 9% to $3.8 trillion, with Bitcoin briefly plunging below $102,000. Tom Lee Says Ethereum Entering ‘Supercycle’ as BitMine Nears 5% of ETH Supply BitMine’s latest purchase lifted its total crypto and cash holdings to $13.4 billion as of October 12, including $12.9 billion in crypto assets and “moonshot” investments. The company’s portfolio now includes 3,032,188 ETH, valued at $4,154 per token, 192 BTC, worth approximately $22 million, a $135 million equity stake in Nasdaq-listed Eightco Holdings, and $104 million in unencumbered cash.

BitMine published Lee’s keynote from the Token2049 conference in Singapore as part of its October Chairman’s Message, in which he outlined the company’s long-term thesis for Ethereum accumulation. BitMine’s rapid expansion has positioned it as the largest Ethereum holder globally and the second-largest public crypto treasury overall, behind Michael Saylor’s Strategy Inc. (MSTR), which controls 640,250 BTC valued at roughly $73 billion. BitMine now ranks ahead of other central Ethereum treasuries, including SharpLink and The Ether Machine, which hold 838,730 ETH and 496,710 ETH, respectively, according to SER data . Source: SER Despite the market chaos, BitMine remains one of the most heavily traded U.S.-listed stocks. Fundstrat data shows the company’s ticker, BMNR, has recorded an average five-day trading volume of $3.5 billion as of October 10, ranking 22nd among all U.S. equities, just behind Coinbase and ahead of UnitedHealth. Combined, BitMine and Strategy account for 88% of global digital asset treasury (DAT) trading volume. However, BitMine’s share price has not been immune to volatility, falling 11% over the past week following a short position taken by Kerrisdale Capital, which questioned the sustainability of the company’s business model. Source: Google Finance Ethereum Eyes $10K as Fusaka Upgrade Nears Testnet Phase Ethereum is positioning for another major leap as developers prepare for the Fusaka upgrade , expected to follow the successful Pectra rollout earlier this year. The update, now entering testnet trials, is designed to reduce transaction fees further and lower the cost of becoming a validator, key steps toward improving scalability and accessibility across the network. If Fusaka launches on schedule by late 2025, analysts believe it could strengthen Ethereum’s path toward $10,000 , particularly as institutional interest in blockchain tokenization and real-world assets continues to expand. Both Pectra and Fusaka form part of Ethereum’s long-term roadmap to enhance efficiency across the base layer and layer-two networks, such as Arbitrum. Ethereum’s recovery from its previous low of $1,400 gained momentum after Pectra, with ETH/USD trading recently around $3,813. However, volatility has remained high, as shown by a flash crash that wiped out over $3.8 billion in leveraged positions before prices rebounded above $4,100. $ETH bouncing on the bull market support band! pic.twitter.com/2vYcYDbXub — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) October 11, 2025 Technical indicators indicate that ETH is holding above support near $3,720, the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level, suggesting a potential near-term reversal if resistance around $4,050–$4,300 is broken. Meanwhile, renewed commentary from Rich Dad, Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has drawn fresh attention to Ethereum’s dual role as a store of value and functional asset . Kiyosaki warned of a looming financial reset and described Ethereum and silver as “hot, hot, hot,” arguing that both combine industrial utility with scarcity.

Bitfarms (BITF) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) surged 26% and 20% respectively on Monday, while Bitdeer (BTDR), IREN (IREN) and MARA Holdings (MARA) advanced around 10%. The rally reflects optimism that booming AI compute demand will help miners. Perhaps boosting sentiment was ChatGPT creator OpenAI striking a deal with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) to build up custom chips for AI and machine learning. Also on Monday, Bloom Energy (BE) announced a $5 billion deal with Brookfield Asset Management to deploy fuel cells in data centers to satisfy AI's voracious energy demand. The gains occurred after Friday's steep downturn as trade tensions between the U.S. and China ratcheted up, with Trump imposing a 100% increase in tariffs on Chinese goods to retaliate against tightening rare earth metals export controls. Investor concerns eased somewhat over the weekend, and the Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes were up 2.1% and 1.4% on Monday. Other crypto related names enjoyed modest gains. Strategy (MSTR), the world's largest bitcoin treasury firm, climbed 2.8%, while crypto exchange Coinbase was roughly flat. Digital brokerage Robinhood, which earns a large portion of its revenue from crypto trading, was up 1%. Ethereum (ETH) treasury firm BitMine (BMNR), meanwhile, bounced almost 7% as the firm said to capitalize on the crypto plunge of the past few days, purchasing over 200,000 tokens worth over $840 million at current prices.

The partnership is part of Nvidia’s initiative to convert AI computing facilities to operate on 800 volts of direct current (VDC). Nvidia revealed its 800 VDC plan early this year, collaborating with several other firms, such as Infineon of Germany. The project aimed to reduce power loss in large-scale AI data centers. The AI chip maker revealed that shifting from alternating current to direct power distribution at 800 volts in data center facilities would minimize internal transmission losses and improve overall energy efficiency. 1200V and 1700V PowiGaN chips possess over 98% efficiency Based in California, Power Integrations specializes in developing high-voltage power conversion chips. The firm will provide gallium nitride (GaN) components built for high efficiency and reliability. According to the company’s press release, the GaN components are specifically designed for the increasing power demands of AI infrastructure. PI is using its 1250V and 1700V #PowiGaN technology to satisfy the rising power demands of AI computing. We are collaborating with @NVIDIA to accelerate the transition to 800 VDC power and megawatt-scale racks. https://t.co/SDSRSuq8wV #AIDataCenter #800VDC #AdvancedPowerSolutions pic.twitter.com/BFCVSlAnLR — Power Integrations (@PwrInt) October 13, 2025 The power solutions firm unveiled its latest 1200V and 1700V PowiGaN chips technology at the 2025 OCP Global Summit in San Jose. The technology is optimized to deliver 800VDC for data center architectures. The latest white paper revealed that the 1250V PowiGaN devices have a higher efficiency than traditional 650V GaN FETs and 1200V silicon carbide (SiC) components, achieving over 98% efficiency. The 1250V PowiGaN also possesses smaller form factors and greater power density. Power Integrations’ white paper, revealed at the OCP Global Summit, shows that the chips are designed for primary and auxiliary power supplies to ensure stable and efficient power distribution across the AI server racks. The power solution company also introduced InnoMux 2-EP ICs, which are equipped with integrated 1700V PowiGaN switches. The 1700V PowiGaN devices can support 1000 VDC input voltage while maintaining over 90% system efficiency in fanless, liquid-cooled 800V systems. “With rising AI power demands, moving to an 800VDC input simplifies rack design, makes more efficient use of space, and reduces copper usage. We see 1250V and 1700V PowiGaN devices as ideal for main and auxiliary power supplies in high-voltage data centers.” – Roland Saint-Pierre , vice president of product development at Power Integrations In an interview with Reuters, Saint-Pierre added that Power Integrations’ track record in automotive-grade GaN devices played a key role in securing the partnership with Nvidia. He noted that the company’s chips are already used in electric vehicles and industrial equipment, where long-term reliability and thermal resilience are critical. Power Integrations’ stock jumps over 18% today The collaboration demonstrates Nvidia’s strategy for tackling AI computing challenges, including energy efficiency. The firm revealed that GPU power demands will continue increasing as AI models become more complex. Power Integrations confirmed that its GaN switches can reduce copper usage, minimize space requirements, and improve overall energy utilization. The collaboration announcement triggered Power Integration’s stock surge to over 18% today, while Nvidia gained 2.7%. POWI stock was trading at $40.96, representing an 18.22% rise over the past 24 hours at publication. However, the stock has also experienced a sustained drop in YTD this year, currently at -33.47%, with a year-to-date range of $34.55 to $69.53. Now, investors await to see if the partnership will help boost investor confidence and help the stock regain a positive outlook. Nvidia stock, on the other hand, was trading at $188.29 at the time of publication, representing a 2.87% rise over the past 24 hours. The stock has also maintained a positive YTD of +40.16%, showing sustained positive investor confidence in the AI chip maker’s performance. Power Integrations is the only supplier of the latest 1250V and 1700V GaN switches in mass production. The firm has deployed over 175 million GaN devices in end-user products such as chargers, EVs, and data centers.

Over 1.6 million leveraged traders were wrecked during the event, highlighting just how crowded the long side had become. While the extreme bearish sentiment has dissipated as Bitcoin and altcoins staged a recovery, experts caution that this does not automatically signal a return to full bullishness and that the market remains in a transitional phase where careful analysis and risk management are essential. Bitcoin and Altcoins Reset The liquidation event, described by market analyst Doctor Profit as a “perfectly executed trade,” wiped out nearly all leveraged positions on altcoins, as liquidation rates approached 99% in several pairs. Doctor Profit pointed to a broader distribution phase in the market since August, during which major market makers quietly sold BTC and altcoins while retail traders continued to buy into short-term bounces. The analyst observed that such a cleansing event has historically led to either fresh accumulation or a major market reversal. Technical patterns, including what some traders have dubbed the “Blood Moon effect,” indicate the crash followed a predictable post-event cycle that occurs roughly 33 days after a significant astronomical marker. Combining both market psychology and technical trends, this phase may act as a reset, helping crypto portfolios recover and prepare for the next directional shift. While crypto markets digest the aftermath, attention has shifted to broader macroeconomic factors. Despite the Columbus Day holiday, US equity markets will operate on Monday, but important federal infrastructure closures could restrict liquidity and make markets more prone to sharp reactions and price fluctuations. Zooming out, tensions in the semiconductor sector are intensifying across the world. China’s ban on NVIDIA GPU purchases, impacting roughly 40% of the company’s revenue, coupled with reduced American demand and efforts to pivot to domestic chip alternatives, is indicative of a potential slowdown for one of the major drivers of technology markets. Bulls and Bears Are Now Even Doctor Profit recommends holding current BTC and altcoin positions while monitoring Monday’s stock market open for directional clarity. Some experts anticipate a renewed bullish phase for Bitcoin, potentially reaching new all-time highs near $130,000, if key support levels hold. Others maintain caution and believe that equities and crypto may diverge in short-term performance. “Now let the dust settle, we prepare for the next major move. It’s still early to call the next direction with certainty, but one thing is already clear: the max-bearish scenario is off the table. The market has reset. Bulls and bears now stand on equal ground in crypto, the imbalance is gone.” While equities have yet to catch up, the analyst stated that the stock market opening and the Japanese Yen’s movement remain some of the crucial signals to watch.

Open Interest Drops $12B as Leverage Ratio Hits Multi-Year Lows – Next Stop $130K?,https://cryptonews.com/news/what-comes-after-the-bitcoin-bloodbath-open-interest-drops-12b-as-leverage-ratio-hits-multi-year-lows-next-stop-130k/,"Bitcoin’s latest market bloodbath has left traders devastated, with over $12 billion in open interest wiped out in just days, one of the sharpest contractions in derivatives positioning in recent history. On-chain data shows that the decline saw Bitcoin open interest plunge from $47 billion to $35 billion, marking a major reset in market leverage following weeks of overheated speculation. The sell-off was triggered by a combination of macroeconomic factors and a cascade of forced liquidations , which was worsened by President Trump’s newly announced tariffs on Chinese imports. The move rattled global risk sentiment and led to over $20 billion in leveraged positions being flushed out. Yet beneath the short-term volatility, analysts say this event could mark a healthy recalibration rather than a structural breakdown. Panic from Bitcoin Bloodbath and China Trade War Fades as BTC Price Recovers to $115K Market indicators now point to broad deleveraging and normalization across the board. The Estimated Leverage Ratio (ELR) has dro pped to levels last seen in 2022, while the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) has fallen to its lowest point since April, suggesting ample liquidity on the sidelines ready to re-enter. Source: CryptoQuant According to Shawn Young, chief analyst at MEXC Research, Bitcoin’s swift rebound to around $115,000 following the largest liquidation event in crypto history shows the market’s resilience. “The Great Reset has exposed a more mature market structure, one where leveraged excesses are cleansed, and conviction capital steps back in,” Young told CryptoNews. Despite the bloodbath, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs saw only minimal outflows of about $4 million , while weekly inflows surpassed $2.7 billion. Bitcoin has now rebounded above $115,000, confirming the broader risk-on positioning across global assets. Optimism surrounding potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and improving liquidity conditions has also revived bullish sentiment. Major indices , such as the S&P 500 futures, have surged over 130 points from Friday’s lows, while gold has hit a new record high above $4,100, and oil prices have climbed back to $60.

According to Young, Bitcoin must now reclaim $120,000 to invalidate bearish setups, with a break above $122,000 indicating that “the market has fully absorbed last week’s storm and is ready for new highs.” On the downside, he warns that renewed trade tensions could push BTC under $100,000 for the first time since May 7th. Retail Floods Binance with $1.36B, History Says Next Stop is $130K From an on-chain perspective, analysts at CryptoQuant observed $1.359 billion in retail deposits to Binance on October 11, one of the largest single-day spikes in a year. JA Martunn, an analyst at the firm, pointed out that these inflows often coincide with sharp price movements, indicating that retail traders remain reactive rather than proactive. Source: CryptoQuant A similar surge on July 14, 2025, preceded a bullish August that saw Bitcoin climb above $124,000 for the first time. Meanwhile, investors are responding positively to fresh statements from Washington. Senior administration officials now describe the U.S.–China relationship as “good,” with the U.S. Treasury Secretary stating that the planned 100% tariffs on Chinese goods “don’t have to happen.” BREAKING: President Trump says “don’t worry about China, it will be all fine.” Trump says China’s President Xi “just had a bad moment.” There it is, the Sunday pre-futures open post we’ve been waiting for. https://t.co/XScHcaNZaV pic.twitter.com/2boflt0kgZ — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) October 12, 2025 This rhetoric shift has further fueled optimism that the sell-off was an overreaction. With Q4 historically being Bitcoin’s strongest quarter, averaging over 70% gains since 2013, analysts say a sustained recovery could provide the momentum needed to test $126,000 and potentially push toward $130,000 in the coming weeks. Technical Analysis: Bitcoin Needs to Clear $116k CME Gap For a Move Above $126k Bitcoin’s ability to hold above its 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) has been key in sustaining the bull trend. The recent flush also allowed Bitcoin to fill the long-standing Weekly CME Gap between $109,700 and $111,310, an important technical target that had remained open since the mid-summer rally. With that gap now closed, market attention has shifted to a new CME Gap between $115,690 and $116,865, which will likely serve as a short-term pivot zone. Analysts suggest that reclaiming and holding the $120,000–$122,000 range would invalidate remaining bearish setups and pave the way for a retest of the $126,000 all-time high. A breakout beyond that level could unlock a measured move toward $130,000 On the downside, Immediate support rests at the $110,000–$111,000 region, which now coincides with the filled CME gap and serves as a key psychological and structural floor. Failure to defend this level could open the door to a $100,000 handle, particularly if geopolitical tensions or macroeconomic risk events re-emerge. The post What Comes After the Bitcoin Bloodbath?

In 2028, SHIB is expected to reach a maximum value of $0.000066. The price of Shiba Inu is predicted to reach an average value of $0.000184 in 2031. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) cryptocurrency, originally a meme coin, has evolved into a comprehensive Shiba Inu ecosystem driven by the Shiba Inu team, significantly impacting the value and utility of Shiba Inu. Key components include ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and Shibarium, a Layer 2 solution to enhance scalability. These developments have boosted SHIB’s adoption and functionality. As SHIB’s ecosystem grows, questions arise about SHIB’s market capitalization, future, and its price trajectory, including SHIB’s price action. Will the advancements in ShibaSwap and Shibarium drive SHIB to new highs and impact the market’s price action? Can SHIB sustain its current price momentum and strengthen its position in the cryptocurrency market with strong community support by flashing bullish signals, indicating a bullish trend? Will SHIB ever reach $1? In this Shiba Inu price prediction, analyzed by Cryptopolitan, we’ll determine future SHIB price trends.

A tight range signals breakout potential consolidation between $0.00001055 and $0.00001104, suggesting an upcoming decisive move. A gradual uptrend, building steady trading above $0.000010, reflects controlled accumulation and growing bullish momentum. October 13, 2025 — Shiba Inu (SHIB) maintains its upward trajectory as investor sentiment strengthens amid moderate market gains. According to CoinMarketCap data, SHIB trades at $0.00001093, marking a 3.04% daily increase. The asset continues to show steady growth as traders closely monitor its performance. With a firm base forming above the $0.000010 level, SHIB demonstrates resilience despite broader fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market. Shiba Inu 1-day price chart: SHIB gradual strength within a defined range On the daily chart, SHIB’s structure reflects controlled growth within a narrow trading corridor. The support at $0.00001055 continues to hold firm, confirming consistent buying interest at lower price levels. Meanwhile, the resistance at $0.00001104 serves as a strong barrier that must be broken to signal renewed bullish continuation. The overall pattern suggests a market in consolidation, preparing for potential breakout momentum. SHIB/USDT Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index (RSI) trends near the mid-to-upper range, showing balanced market conditions and moderate buying pressure. Moving averages reveal that shorter-term averages have crossed above longer-term ones, supporting a bullish continuation signal. Trading volume remains steady, reflecting sustained participation from both retail and institutional traders. Shiba Inu 4-hour price chart: LINK consolidation with bullish undertones On the 4-hour timeframe, SHIB trades steadily above $0.00001060, showing that buyers are maintaining firm control. The shorter-term price movement suggests minor consolidation, reflecting healthy market stability after the recent upward push. Price structure remains consistent with the broader daily uptrend, emphasizing gradual accumulation and sustained momentum. SHIB/USDT Chart: TradingView The 4-hour RSI stays near the neutral zone, indicating equilibrium between buying and selling forces. A noticeable uptick in trading volume suggests renewed interest from short-term traders anticipating a potential breakout above $0.00001104. As long as SHIB remains above current support levels, technical conditions favor a continued rise, with market participants likely eyeing incremental gains over the coming sessions. Shiba Inu technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.00001242 SELL SMA 5 $0.00001255 SELL SMA 10 $0.00001256 SELL SMA 21 $0.00001244 SELL SMA 50 $0.00001263 SELL SMA 100 $0.00001289 SELL SMA 200 $0.00001302 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $ 0.00001246 SELL EMA 5 $ 0.00001248 SELL EMA 10 $ 0.00001251 SELL EMA 21 $ 0.00001262 SELL EMA 50 $ 0.00001280 SELL EMA 100 $ 0.00001303 SELL EMA 200 $ 0.00001394 SELL What can you expect from the SHIB price next? In the upcoming sessions, SHIB is likely to continue trading within its current consolidation range, between $0.00001055 and $0.00001104, as market participants await a clear breakout signal. If buying pressure persists and price manages to close above the $0.00001104 resistance, it could trigger a short-term rally toward the $0.00001150–$0.00001200 zone, marking the next potential upside target. However, if momentum fades and SHIB fails to sustain above its $0.00001055 support, a brief pullback toward lower accumulation areas may occur before any renewed upward move. The market currently leans slightly bullish, with steady accumulation suggesting that traders remain confident in the token’s medium-term potential. As long as SHIB holds above its key support, expectations remain tilted toward gradual appreciation rather than sharp volatility. Is Shiba Inu a good investment? Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains supported by a strong community and expanding ecosystem, including Shibarium, DeFi integrations, and metaverse projects that aim to boost its utility and long-term value. Despite these advancements, SHIB remains a high-volatility asset that trades significantly below its all-time high. For investors, SHIB may offer short- to medium-term opportunities if bullish momentum continues, but it carries significant risk. Caution and portfolio diversification are advised, as SHIB’s long-term success depends on continued development progress and sustained community engagement. Why is Shiba up today? Shiba Inu’s (SHIB) price uptick on October 13, 2025, can be attributed to renewed buying activity and increased investor confidence in the broader crypto market. The token’s 3.04% rise to $0.00001093 reflects steady accumulation by traders capitalizing on its stability above the $0.00001055 support zone. Market sentiment has improved as SHIB continues to hold within its short-term bullish structure, supported by consistent trading volume and strong community participation. Additionally, optimism surrounding ongoing ecosystem developments, particularly Shibarium’s growth and DeFi integrations, has reinforced bullish sentiment among holders. This combination of technical strength and fundamental support has kept SHIB’s price movement resilient, with traders anticipating a potential breakout above the $0.00001104 resistance in the near term. Latest SHIB News ARLO has announced partnership with Shiba Inu to launch AI intelligence engine on Shibarium. https://twitter.com/GoArloApp/status/1973012202094285138 Will Shiba Inu recover? Buyers are vigorously defending a drop below the immediate resistance levels and support channels on the price chart. If the SHIB price holds its momentum above the $0.000014 level, we might see further surges. Will SHIB reach $0.00005? Yes, according to the long-term SHIB price prediction, those who plan to buy Shiba Inu may see the current price projected to reach up to $0.00005 by 2028. Will SHIB reach $0.0001 Yes, according to crypto experts’ long-term predictions, SHIB’s role in the cryptocurrency market is projected to lead it to reach $0.0001 by 2029. Will SHIB reach $100? SHIB’s goal of reaching $100 is virtually impossible due to its vast circulating supply in the meme coin market, which significantly influences the price movements of SHIB. Additionally, to get the $100 mark, SHIB would require a significant increase in its market cap, which is beyond imagination for a meme coin. Does SHIB have an excellent long-term future? The Shiba Inu price made headlines in January 2025 after Shytoshi Kusama, the lead developer, stepped down. However, SHIB shows some positive movement, suggesting the ecosystem may have a promising long-term future. However, its success will also depend on macroeconomic factors, partnerships, broader market adoption trends, and other regulatory developments that influence market cycles. You are advised to do your own research and form expert opinions before investing in the highly volatile crypto market.

Additionally, banks would be prohibited from denying or withdrawing services to customers based on lawful crypto-related activities, directly addressing industry concerns over “debanking.” Farage connected the debanking issue to his own experience, telling the conference crowd, “I went to 10 banks, all of whom refused me an account,” and adding, “No wonder so many people are going for Bitcoin—because they can’t close you down, and that is the ultimate freedom.” Meanwhile, Farage characterized the Bank of England’s plans for a central bank digital currency as “the ultimate authoritarian nightmare” and vowed to “stop it overnight” should Reform win the next election. He also targeted the Bank of England’s proposed stablecoin holding limits, capping personal holdings at £10,000 to £20,000 and business holdings at £10 million, calling the restrictions “frankly ridiculous.” According to Bloomberg , Farage claimed he had discussed the stablecoin caps directly with Andrew Bailey, the Governor of the Bank of England. The Reform leader stated that the UK government is falling behind international competitors and must act quickly to regulate the crypto industry to safeguard Britain’s position as a financial hub. Farage said “this whole area of digital assets and crypto just isn’t being talked about at all,” and pointed out that “we’ve got no regulated market.” He also said that if Reform wins the next election, his government would enact the Crypto Assets and Digital Finance Bill “very, very quickly.” Reform UK currently leads in numerous polling projections. However, Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system presents a major structural challenge to translating that support into parliamentary seats, as demonstrated in the 2024 general election when Reform received 4.1 million votes but secured only five seats. The next UK general election is not expected until 2029, leaving four years for both political and market conditions to shift. Why Global Crypto Competition is Forcing UK Regulators to Act Britain’s regulatory environment now faces competitive pressure from the United States , where the Trump administration accelerated crypto-friendly policies, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoin oversight. The European Union has also instituted a unified regulatory framework for digital assets, creating incentives for UK policymakers to clarify their own approach to crypto regulation. Earlier this month, the Bank of England announced that it was considering exemption plans for its proposed stablecoin holding limits for crypto exchanges and other firms requiring large holdings for liquidity purposes. Most recently, Governor Andrew Bailey acknowledged that stablecoins could drive financial innovation and coexist with traditional banking systems. Bank of England Governor says stablecoins could reduce UK reliance on commercial banks while proposing controversial ownership caps. #UK #Stablecoin https://t.co/TW5EGT8a6O — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 1, 2025 The Bank of England is also preparing to permit stablecoins as settlement assets in its Digital Securities Sandbox, a controlled environment for testing blockchain-based trading and issuance. The uncertain stance of the nation has prompted industry executives to warn that overly restrictive regulations in the UK will risk diverting business and talent to jurisdictions with more favorable crypto frameworks. As it stands now, the Financial Conduct Authority will complete its consultation on whether crypto firms should face the same regulatory standards as traditional financial institutions by year-end, with implementation expected to begin in January 2026.

Following the recent statements from former President Trump that shook investors, BTC has been volatile briefly falling under $110,000, and as a result, the next major movement has the market players and enthusiasts analyzing intensely. As Bitcoin still sits as top coin, the search for undervalued bargains has become more aggressive, and investors are now seeking projects that have solid fundamentals that are coupled with explosive growth potential. One project that shines brightly in this direction is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Now in Phase 6 of its presale, it currently sells at $0.035 and already has over 65% sold out. It has managed to raise over $17.25 million in the presale and has drawn over 16,910 investors. For investors looking for a cheap altcoin that has huge potential, MUTM is the kind of project that can redefine the market alongside BTC in 2025. Bitcoin Price Forecast: Range Persists Following Sharp Crash Bitcoin has been navigating a defined range since July, with multiple attempts to break above or below proving the market’s cautious stance. So far, this is a big reset rather than a full cycle shift, with up to $20 billion in long positions below $110K contrasted against just $2 billion in shorts, signaling where the market’s liquidity hunts may focus next. Even as BTC dips 10–20%, the higher timeframe structure remains intact, meaning the current cycle isn’t broken as long as the range low around $112K–$113K holds. True and false breakouts have already occurred, and this weekend marked a third massive test of the lower boundary. Until the range low is decisively flipped to resistance, Bitcoin is likely to bounce back toward the range high, maintaining the broader market structure. While traders analyze these dynamics for BTC, investors are also exploring opportunities in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that complement BTC market movements. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Run Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains very much up the mast with strong momentum as it plods along in Phase 6 of presale, driving an impetus to aggressive interest. Up to this point, over 16,910 investors have invested over $17.25 million, registering continued confidence in the project’s future and exactly where it is in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. Mutuum Finance protocol achieves dynamic, real-time Liquidation terms and Loan-to-Value (LTV), which are automatically adjusted as the market fluctuates. It makes the platform able to hedge volatility extensively, thereby making the platform much secure when markets are volatile. Mutuum Finance is deploying the first version of its new lending and borrowing protocol in Q4 2025 onto Sepolia Testnet. The protocol will have a long rundown of primary functionalities to include the likes of mtTokens, liquidator bot, and debt tokens among other functionality to help toward peak efficiency and usability. ETH and USDT will be activated on the first day for loaning/borrowing collateral, thus having working, scalable, high-speed DeFi activity. Safety Improvement The project’s security measures protect the protocol from the influence of market shock as well as makes all stable. MUTM’s lending management platform is built to maximize lending ability, together with overall capital efficiency, by continued leveraging of highly correlated holdings. Insolvency risk is reduced, and the platform will provide for a stable, secure, and sustainable DeFi borrowing and lending experience. Top Altcoin to Watch During Bitcoin Volatility Bitcoin’s current value range of $112K–$113K emphasizes the uncertain reset of the market, but investors are looking for altcoins that have strong upside potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already been able to raise over $17.25 million from over 16,910 investors in Phase 6 of its presale, and it has sold already 65% of tokens. Its lending and borrowing protocol set to go live on Sepolia Testnet, with liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot, is designed to facilitate secure, scalable, and efficient DeFi activity. Interested investors looking for a low-cost, high-growth cryptocurrency have to act quickly to purchase MUTM tokens before the presale advances to Phase 7.

53098154,604724,1760385632,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53098154.jpeg,Financial Analyst Reveals How XRP Will Bridge Physical And Digital Value,https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-will-bridge-value/,"The growing shift in global finance is pointing toward a future where traditional assets, like gold, merge with digital systems—and XRP may play a pivotal role in connecting the two. Financial analyst Versan Aljarrah of Black Swan Capitalist suggested that XRP could serve as the bridge between physical and digital value, aligning with its goal to become a global bridge currency that enables instant, low-cost settlements across different networks and asset classes. XRP’s Role In Bridging Physical And Digital Value On October 10, Aljarrah shared a post on X social media asserting that gold is returning as the world’s reserve asset and that the next phase of global finance involves its digitization. He explained that XRP plays a vital role in this financial transformation. According to him, XRP represents the bridge that will connect tangible Real-World Assets (RWA) , such as gold, to the digital systems now being developed worldwide. His arguments centre on XRP’s design as a natural settlement technology capable of transferring value instantly between assets and networks without relying on traditional intermediaries such as SWIFT . To support his claim, Aljarrah referenced statements made by renowned gold mining expert and investor Pierre Lassonde, who explained that central banks worldwide have been quietly restructuring their reserves over the past few years. Lassonde noted that central banks have purchased large amounts of gold , roughly one-third of the newly mined production, while simultaneously reducing their holdings of US dollars. He said that the dollar’s share in global reserves has fallen from 72% in 2020 to below 58%, while gold reserves holdings have more than doubled. He also emphasized that countries like China, India, Turkey, and Poland are buying gold to reduce reliance on a reserve currency tied to another nation’s debt . Gold, by contrast, is an independent currency that is not tied to any country’s debt. Lassonde further highlighted China’s efforts to develop a competing financial messaging network to SWIFT, one that’s gaining traction among emerging economies in Africa and Asia. These changes, according to the mining expert, reflect a major reordering of global power and financial independence, accelerated by frustrations with the current US administration’s aggressive stance toward global partners. Aljarrah has connected this sentiment to XRP, envisioning the cryptocurrency’s function as a bridge between diverging systems, linking physical wealth, like gold, with borderless digital liquidity. The Token As The Backbone Of The New Financial System In a more recent post, Aljarrah clarified that XRP was not intended to be traded for short-term gains, but rather to be held as a key to the emerging digital financial structure. He referred to this transformation as “the Ripple effect,” describing XRP as the backbone and rails of a new monetary system where value moves seamlessly between banks, assets, and borders. According to him, holding the altcoin symbolizes entry into a future financial system that is free from traditional intermediaries and centralized control. This vision closely aligns with Ripple’s long-term goal of modernizing cross-border payments by integrating blockchain technology into the institutional finance sector.",XRP|ripple|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|XRP|FIAT|MACROECONOMICS|ASIA,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-13 20:00:32

Related Reading: XRP Traders Face Fresh Selling Pressure As Large Holders Move Out Mt. Gox Origins And Staggering Returns According to blockchain tracker Lookonchain, a cluster of addresses tied to coins pulled from Mt. Gox more than 13 years ago sent 300 BTC to Binance in a single transaction. Those coins were reportedly bought at about $11 each, meaning the original outlay was roughly $8,151. The transfer is now worth about $33.47 million, a mark-up of roughly 410,624%. Reports have disclosed that about 590 BTC still remain in the same group of addresses. The market crash just woke up a sleeping Bitcoin OG, who deposited 300 #BTC($33.47M) to #Binance 2 hours ago. He originally withdrew 749 $BTC($8,151 at the time) from #MtGox 13 years ago, when $BTC was just $11. He moved 159 $BTC to a new wallet a year ago but didn’t sell —… pic.twitter.com/tSxgO0Mw5E — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) October 12, 2025 Wallet Activity And What Changed Last year, the same owner moved 159 BTC into a new wallet and then left it untouched. This recent move is different because the coins arrived in an exchange hot wallet, where they can be sold quickly. Traders and market watchers noted the difference: one action kept coins on the chain, the other put them within reach of an order book. Whether the owner chooses to sell some or all of the 300 BTC is not known, but the presence of those funds on Binance makes rapid selling possible. Market Moves And Flows Bitcoin’s price recovered to about $115,000 on Monday, after dipping to $102,000 on Friday. That drop triggered billions in liquidations and left traders on edge. Based on figures, ETFs recorded $2.7 billion in inflows over the last week, and institutional demand showed resilience despite the volatility. Still, the market’s calm is fragile; a large sell order from an old holder could change short-term supply dynamics quickly. The move was flagged by on-chain analysts and then amplified across social platforms. Exchange inflows from wallets tied to early-era miners or Mt. Gox addresses tend to draw attention because they signal supply that was previously dormant coming back into circulation. In this case, the numbers are large enough to get traders’ attention. Possible Scenarios And Risks If some of the 300 BTC is sold, price pressure may increase, particularly during thin trading windows. Alternatively, the transfer could be part of estate consolidation or a decision to move funds to cold storage, in which case selling may not follow. Related Reading: A 5% Bitcoin Drop In October?

The project reached its latest milestone in record time, crossing $850,000 on July 25. Markets Crash The cryptocurrency market suffered one of its largest crashes in recent memory after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls on critical software. Bitcoin and the wider cryptocurrency market plunged following the decision, with the flagship cryptocurrency falling to a low of $102,000 on Binance. Analysts were concerned about a drop below $100,000, which could have potentially ended the current bull cycle. CoinGlass also reported that over 1.6 million traders were liquidated over the past 24 hours, with $7 billion in positions sold in under an hour on Friday. However, it noted that total losses could be significantly higher. However, prices have recovered as markets start the week in positive territory. Bitcoin is up almost 3% at $114,651, while Ethereum is up nearly 9%, trading around $4,130. Ripple is also up 9%, while Solana is up 10%, trading around $195.

CZ Pardon Talks Intensify, Report Claims According to the Sunday report , discussion over Zhao’s possible pardon has recently “heated up” within the Trump administration. On Friday, Fox Business correspondent Charles Gasparino reported that “people close” to the crypto executive say Trump “is leaning toward a pardon” despite others “worrying” about the optics of a pardon given the president’s business interests in crypto. SCOOP: People close to @cz_binance , the former @binance chief who spent some time in the can amid the Biden Admin's crackdown on all things crypto, say discussions inside the White House are heating up on the possibility of a pardon from @realDonaldTrump . Many Trump insiders… — Charles Gasparino (@CGasparino) October 10, 2025 “Many Trump insiders believe the fraud case against Changpeng Zhao, known in the digital space simply as CZ, was pretty weak, and certainly not something that merited a felony charge and jail time,” Gasparino said, adding that it “could set the stage for CZ’s return to the crypto exchange.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren Pushes for Answers on Pardon Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering (AML) program at Binance, which resulted in his resignation as the crypto company’s CEO. The Binance founder previously considered applying for a pardon in December 2024, following then-U.S. President Joe Biden’s pardon of his son, Hunter, in two criminal cases. “No wish to be CEO again,” Zhao said in an X post at the time. “But definitely wouldn’t mind a pardon.” Binance, Emirati firm MGX, and Trump-linked crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLF) drew scrutiny following a $2 billion deal involving USD1, WLF’s stablecoin, in May. Pardon talks are likely to draw ire from key Democratic politicians, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who wrote to White House Counsel David Warrington and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on the matter in May. “The convergence of Mr. Zhao’s pardon application and Binance’s financial entanglements with the President’s family presents urgent concerns regarding the integrity of our justice system,” the letter states.

In the last few days, the cryptocurrency suffered a brutal intraday plunge — a crash of roughly 40–42 % from peak to trough — only to claw back much of those losses in a sharp rebound. Against that background, a prominent chart analyst known as XRP CAPTAIN on X has staked a bold claim: the current setup mirrors the path that, in 2017, preluded approximately 6,000 % rally — and thus, a similar explosive move may lie ahead. The Anatomy of the Recent Flash Crash The extreme wick that formed was not the result of a collapsed narrative, but rather a structural breakdown of liquidity . Thin order books, aggressive leverage, and cascading stop-loss triggers combined to pull XRP from ~$2.70 to lows near ~$1.60 before buyers reasserted control. Such moves are painful in real time, but many technical analysts argue they serve a cleansing role — washing out weak hands and resetting the balance between accumulation and distribution. #XRP In 2017 Right Before 6,000% Pump It Flash Crash Almost -53% #XRP Flash Crash -48% Last Week You Know What Im Thinking I Have A Guess Price Explosion In The Coming Weeks pic.twitter.com/M2KgNtC05V — XRP CAPTAIN (@UniverseTwenty) October 13, 2025 2017 Echo: Why the Historical Parallel Matters Proponents of the analogy highlight a repeating pattern: a violent purge, followed by sideways absorption in overlooked bands, then a sharp acceleration. In 2017, that sequence laid the groundwork for XRP’s parabolic ascent. While no two cycles are identical, chartists see structural continuity in the overshoot-recovery oscillation, especially given current capital flows and on-chain signs. Yet replicating a 6,000 % gain from today’s base is more illustrative than predictive. With XRP hovering around $2.50–$2.80 in recent trading, a 6,000 % leap would push it near $150+, underscoring the audacity of the parallel rather than serving as a practical, immediate target. Counterflows: Whale Selling, Technical Weakness & Risks The bullish thesis is far from unanimous. Large holders — whales — are offloading roughly $50 million in XRP daily, shunting supply onto exchanges and intensifying downward pressure. Technical patterns, including a descending triangle, suggest that breaking below key support near $2.75–$2.80 could open a slide toward $2.20 or worse. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Legendary trader Peter Brandt has flagged XRP as a potential short candidate if that triangle resolves downward. So long as capital continues flowing to the sell side, parabolic dreams remain under threat. Catalysts to Watch & Timing Considerations For the bullish thesis to gain traction, a few elements must align. Holding support above $2.75–$2.80 is critical; a decisive breakout above $2.90–$3.10 would validate upside conviction. On the fundamentals front, speculation over an XRP spot ETF has drawn interest and could act as a trigger. Meanwhile, macro factors — regulation, rate moves, and institutional flows — will amplify market direction. Worth noting: XRP CAPTAIN recently signaled that the “final run up” could begin within 2–4 weeks. That timeframe aligns with the typical window following a liquidity purge in prior cycles. A Setup, Not a Script XRP CAPTAIN’s dramatic invocation of the 2017 percentage move has reignited bullish fervor, but it is not a guarantee — it is a hypothesis grounded in chart symmetry and market behavior. The recent flash crash was a harsh but potentially cleansing event . Now the price must prove strength above key zones, while on-chain flows must reverse from net selling to net accumulation. If whales pause their dump and traders show renewed conviction, the stage could be set for a strong momentum phase. But if support fails and distribution continues, the historical echo risks fading into wishful noise. Regardless of the outcome, the next few weeks will prove pivotal.

Bitcoin (BTC) plunged to a low of $102,000 on Binance before recovering, sparking concerns of a drop below $100,000. However, the flagship cryptocurrency recovered and stabilized around $112,000, and is looking to reclaim the $115,000 level. The market rebound occurred after US and Chinese officials moved to cool tariff fears, and the odds of a 100% tariff dropped significantly. Trader Who Shorted Bitcoin (BTC) Opens More Positions A crypto trader who made $192 million after a suspiciously timed bet just before the market crash has opened up more bearish positions. The whale trader has opened a $163 million leveraged perpetual contract to short Bitcoin . The position is currently valued at $3.5 million in profit, and will be liquidated if BTC crosses $125,500. The trader caught the community’s attention after opening a short position just minutes before President Trump’s tariff announcement, which sent the markets plummeting. As a result, the trader in question pocketed $192 million in profits. The community believes the trader is an “insider whale” because of the timing of the trades. Some members believe the trader was the reason for the leverage flush on Friday. “The crazy part is that he shorted another nine figures worth of BTC and ETH minutes before the cascade happened. And this was just publicly on Hyperliquid, imagine what he did on CEXs or elsewhere. I’m pretty sure this guy played a huge role in what happened today.” Investigation Ties Whale To Former BitForex CEO An on-chain investigation has tied the Hyperliquid whale controlling over 100,000 BTC to former BitForex CEO Garrett Jin. BitForex is a defunct exchange that was embroiled in a fraud scandal. On-chain investigator Eye noted that the Bitcoin whale’s main wallet, ereignis.eth, was connected with another ENS name, garrettjin.eth, which directly led to Jin’s verified X account. The investigator noted in a post on X, “The ENS name ereignis.eth (“event” in German) confirms his link to this wallet, identifying him as the actor behind the large-scale operations on Hyperliquid/Hyperunit.” The wallet activity also matched Jin’s business dealings, including transfers to staking contracts and addresses funded by exchanges. However, not everyone is convinced. Crypto analyst Quinten François doubted claims linking the Hyperliquid whale to the former BitForex CEO, arguing the evidence was too convenient. “Why would you have an .eth name leading to your X handle in a wallet that directly connects to market manipulation wallets and wallets for other crimes? Sounds way too simple to be true.” Crypto.com CEO Calls For Probe Into Exchanges Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek has called for an investigation into crypto exchanges that suffered the largest losses after a record $20 billion in crypto liquidations in 24 hours. Marszałek urged regulators to conduct a “thorough review of fairness and practices” and investigate whether trading platforms had slowed down services, mispriced assets, or failed to maintain anti-manipulation and compliance controls. “Regulators should look into the exchanges that had the most liquidations in the last 24 hours. Any of them slowing down to a halt, effectively not allowing people to trade? Were all trades priced correctly and in line with indexes?” According to data from CoinGlass, Hyperliquid led all exchanges in liquidations with $10.31 billion wiped out. ByBit registered $4.65 billion in liquidations, followed by Binance with $2.41 billion. OKX, HTX, and Gate also registered smaller but notable liquidations. Galaxy Digital Secures Investment To Transform Former Bitcoin Mining Site To AI Data Center Galaxy Digital has secured a $460 million private investment to accelerate the transformation of its former Bitcoin mining site into an AI data center. The investment involves the purchase of 12.77 million Class A shares at $36 per share, with the proceeds earmarked for general corporate use and the expansion of the company’s Helios campus, expected to deliver 133 megawatts of IT capacity by 2026. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz stated, “Having one of the world’s largest and most sophisticated institutional investors make such a significant investment in our company will support our strategic vision and our ability to build leading businesses across digital assets and data centers.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is struggling to regain momentum and reclaim $115,000, with the price down nearly 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $114,173. The flagship cryptocurrency plunged to a low of $102,000 on Friday before settling at $112,980. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell 1.96% to $110,768. BTC made a strong recovery on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067 before dropping during the ongoing session. The weekend collapse was triggered by new tariffs imposed on Chinese goods in response to Beijing's attempts to impose restrictions on the export of rare earth minerals. BTC will look to decisively reclaim $116,000 as positive sentiment returns after the weekend crash. A tariff announcement by President Donald Trump was all it took to spark chaos in the market. However, the recovery has seen BTC recoup almost 50% of its losses already. The Kobeissi Letter stated, “If you include the after-hours drop-in futures, the S&P 500 is up +120 points at the open. This has effectively erased 50% of the decline seen late last week. Now, we await more guidance from the Trump Admin.” Sentiment turned bullish on Sunday as markets recovered. As a result, BTC recovered, rising nearly 4% to briefly cross $116,000 before volatility and selling pressure pulled the price lower. While prices have turned bearish again, analysts believe another major crash is unlikely. “You never know what the W close and next week will bring, of course, especially since legacy barely had time to respond to Trump. However, I am not overly worried. Everything was poised for a correction anyway, but it all got amplified, and we had a system breakdown.” BTC traders face a dilemma this week, wondering if the worst is over or whether there is more downside to come. One trader believes there is more downside, stating in a post on X, “Last week’s flash crash perfectly bounced off our diagonal uptrend support from August 2024 at 40k. I’m looking for at least a retest of 108, but as many of you know, HTF has bearish indications. Will check 1D when we get an intra support retest at 107-108.” BTC traded in bullish territory last week, and began the previous week with a 1.41% increase to $122,318. The price registered a marginal rise on Saturday before reaching an intraday high of $125,750 on Sunday. BTC ultimately ended the weekend at $123,520, up 0.87%. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose 0.97% and settled at $124,720, but not before reaching an intraday high of $126.296. BTC lost momentum on Tuesday, falling almost 3% to $121,393. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 2% and settling at $123,343. Source: TradingView Selling pressure returned on Thursday as BTC fell 1.32% to a low of $119,713 before settling at $121,714. BTC and the crypto market crashed on Friday after President Trump announced 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls for software. The announcement was in retaliation for China's decision to impose restrictions on rare earth minerals. As a result, BTC plunged to $102,000 on Binance before recovering and settling at $112,980. Selling pressure persisted on Saturday as the price fell almost 2% to $110,768. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, markets recovered on Sunday. As a result, BTC rose nearly 4% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,067. Selling pressure has returned during the ongoing session, with the price down almost 1%, trading around $114,474.
