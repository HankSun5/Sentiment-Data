What started as just another volatile day descended into chaos after the US imposed 100% tariffs on China, leaving the markets reeling. Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted to a low of $102,000 on Binance, with fears of a drop below $100,000, as the cryptocurrency market shed over 10% of its value amid plummeting prices. Market Carnage The cryptocurrency market suffered tremendous losses on Saturday, with over $19 billion wiped out, according to data from Coinglass. Coinglass described the crash as “the largest liquidation event in crypto history.” Markets crashed after President Trump imposed 100% tariffs on China and new export controls on software. The announcement triggered a steep decline in Bitcoin prices, which fell to a low of $102,000 on Binance. However, it has recovered since and is currently trading above $111,000. CoinGlass also reported that over 1.6 million traders were liquidated over the past 24 hours, with over $7 billion in positions sold in less than an hour on Friday. However, it noted that total losses could be significantly higher. Meanwhile, Binance suffered a major outage, adding to an already chaotic day. Many users reported frozen accounts, failed stop-loss orders, and flash crashes that briefly sent some altcoins to near zero. Experts have warned of a broader market contagion, with some estimates predicting total liquidations above $30 billion. Brian Strugats, head trader at Multicoin Capital, stated, “The focus is now on counterparty exposure and whether this triggers broader market contagion.” Meanwhile, Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, put Bitcoin's next support line at $100,000, adding that a drop below this level could signal the end of the bull cycle. “A drop below this would signal the end of the past three-year bull cycle.” Crypto Community In Shock As Trader Shorts Bitcoin Right Before Crash The cryptocurrency community has been rocked by potential market manipulation after a trader shorted Bitcoin minutes before the market crash. According to crypto analyst Vivek Sen, the account was created on the same day of the crash, raising widespread suspicion and concern among the crypto community. “SOMEONE JUST OPENED A #BITCOIN SHORT 30 MINS BEFORE TRUMP'S TARIFF ANNOUNCEMENT AND JUST CLOSED WITH $88,000,000 PROFIT. HE OPENED THIS ACCOUNT TODAY.” Members of the cryptocurrency community have accused the trader of insider activity, with crypto attorney John Deaton calling for a full investigation. Saturday’s crash is one of the largest liquidation events in crypto history, triggered by the US government imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls on software. The announcement sent shockwaves through crypto and financial markets, with Bitcoin , Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies trading deep in the red. CoinGlass data revealed that $19 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated within 24 hours, with $7 billion of the liquidations occurring in just one hour on Friday. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has reclaimed $111,000 after suffering one of the largest crashes in its history, plunging to a low of $102,000 on Binance. The flagship cryptocurrency traded above $122,000 on Wednesday before dropping to $121,000 on Thursday. However, markets crashed after the US announced sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls after China announced curbs on rare earth minerals. The developments caught traders off guard, sending shockwaves through the market. Experts believe there is a chance for the decline to spill over into next week after the weekend. Head of Markets Ray Salmond stated, “If we look at liquidation heatmap data from Hyblock Capital, which basically shows where all the short and long positions are across various orderbooks at centralized crypto exchanges, we can see that there’s a liquidity pocket of long positions that are being exploited…that pocket extends from $120,000 to $115,000 and from $115,000 to $113,000.” However, spot Bitcoin ETFs helped cushion the downside, reporting net inflows of $2.72 billion for the week ending Friday. The Kobeissi Letter commented on Friday’s selloff, stating, “Volume was so strong that it led to the first EVER $20,000 candlestick in Bitcoin, a -$380 BILLION drop in market cap, before a V-shaped bottom as shorts were closed. Not only was this the largest liquidation ever, it was nine times the previous record. This event will be referenced for years to come.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs reported net outflows of $4.5 million on Friday. BTC heads into a crucial week, with a Senate vote on a stopgap funding bill, which could act as a catalyst for price action. The flagship cryptocurrency could rebound if the funding bill passes. Markets will also be watching for US-China trade developments as the APEC summit nears. BTC started the weekend positively, registering a marginal increase and settling at $122,458. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rallied, surging past $125,000 to a new all-time high of $125,559. However, it could not stay at this level and ultimately settled at $123,520. BTC surged to a new all-time high on Monday, crossing $126,000 to reach $126,296 before settling at $124,720. Despite strong bullish momentum, BTC retreated on Tuesday, falling nearly 3% and settling at $121,393. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising almost 2% to reclaim $123,000 and settle at $123,343. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $119,713 before reclaiming $120,000 and settling at $121,714. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as President Trump imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, decimating investor sentiment. As a result, BTC fell as low as $102,000 on Binance before closing the day at $112,980. The price continued dropping on Saturday, falling to an intraday low of $109,683 before settling at $110,768. BTC is up almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $111,649. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Meanwhile, President Trump is contemplating a presidential pardon for Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. However, the administration is worried about the optics of such a decision. Here are the biggest stories of the week! Bitcoin Luxembourg's Intergenerational Sovereign Wealth Fund has allocated 1% of its portfolio to Bitcoin ETFs and other crypto assets. The decision, announced by finance minister Gilles Roth, makes Luxembourg the first country in the Eurozone to invest in Bitcoin through its sovereign fund. Crypto entrepreneur Roger Ver , popularly called “Bitcoin Jesus,” reached a deal with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to have his tax evasion case dropped. Ver was arrested in April 2024 and charged with mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. Ethereum Crypto asset manager Grayscale has enabled staking for its US Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and its Ethereum Mini Trust ETF products. The decision allows investors to earn additional yield on their holdings. The asset manager has also activated staking for the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL). Business Web3 wallet MetaMask has introduced perpetual contract trading after launching in-wallet access to Hyperliquid’s DEX market. The feature will help MetaMask establish itself as an all-in-one self-custodial trading and investment hub for global finance. Dogecoin treasury company CleanCore announced that it holds 710 million DOGE worth $188 million. The company aims to hold 1 billion DOGE and is backed by the Dogecoin Foundation. Intercontinental Exchange , the parent entity of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), has announced a $2 billion stake in prediction market platform Polymarket. The move marks its foray into event-driven markets and enhances the platform’s credibility in the US. RWA tokenization platform Ondo Finance completed the acquisition of Oasis Pro, a regulated digital asset broker-dealer and alternative trading system (ATS). The deal allows Ondo Finance to develop and provide tokenized securities markets in the US. Web3 NEAR has developed the Intents framework for seamless, multichain execution. Intents utilizes solvers and chain signatures to create a process that feels as simple as a token swap. For developers, Intents enables the creation of dApps that can interact with multiple chains. Developers can also access the tooling and libraries that come bundled with Intents. Decrypt has partnered with Opera, bringing Decrypt’s breaking news and industry analysis directly into the Opera browser. Regulation The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will formalize an “innovation exemption” for crypto and digital asset companies by the end of the year. The exemption will allow companies to leverage digital assets and other innovative technologies in the US. President Trump is reportedly considering a presidential pardon for Binance founder Changpeng Zhao . A presidential pardon could restore Zhao’s reputation in the cryptocurrency industry and clear the path for a return to Binance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to the latest data, MicroStrategy's Bitcoin portfolio currently consists of 640,031 BTC. The portfolio's total value is $71.25 billion. The company's average acquisition cost is $73,983, and its current earnings ratio is 50.48% (approximately $23.9 billion in profit).

On May 17, 2023, Tether said it would regularly allocate up to 15% of net realized operating profits to purchase bitcoin for reserves, adding BTC to surplus rather than using it to back circulating USDT one-for-one. The company framed the move as strengthening its balance sheet with a long-term store of value. BTC and gold as parallel pillars Gold sits alongside bitcoin in that mix. Tether issues tether gold (XAUt), a token backed by allocated bars, and said on July 24 that more than 7.66 tons of metal backed outstanding tokens as of June 30, 2025. Separately, as CoinDesk reported on Sept. 5, 2025, citing the Financial Times, Tether has held talks to invest across the gold value chain — from mining and refining to royalties — as part of a broader diversification push. Ardoino has grouped the assets rhetorically before. On Sept. 7, he referenced bitcoin, gold and land as hedges and later dismissed suggestions that Tether sold BTC to accumulate gold, saying the firm remained committed to growing its bitcoin position. Today's eight-word post is less a policy shift than a restatement — bitcoin as a strategic asset added with profits, and gold as a parallel pillar via tokenization and potential upstream investments — while most reserves remain in liquid instruments such as U.S. Treasurys per attestations. The next reserve report, expected late this month or early next month, will show whether allocations to BTC and gold have changed. As of Sunday, 8:10 p.m. UTC, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) was down 8.88% year to date, while bitcoin and gold — BTC-USD and XAU-USD — were up 22.79% and 52.91%, respectively, according to MarketWatch.",Markets|Bitcoin|Gold|Tether|Tether Gold|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|USDT|XAUT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-12 20:48:52

With geopolitical tensions rising, the European nation is strengthening its ties to China and diversifying its economy. The Swiss government is looking east for stability and diversification as it intensifies trade relations with China due to the record-high tariffs on exports imposed by the U.S. administration. According to a joint statement issued on Friday, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi agreed to speed up the negotiations to upgrade the 2014 free trade agreement between their countries. The announcement came after the fourth round of a strategic dialogue held in Bellinzona, a town in southern Switzerland. Switzerland looks to China as U.S. relations remain strained The free trade agreement with China was the first such deal that China signed with a continental European country. Since then, trade volumes between the two nations have grown substantially, with Switzerland exporting high-tech goods, pharmaceuticals, and luxury products while importing electronics and industrial components. Both governments said that modernizing the decade-old pact will help make bilateral trade “more predictable and sustainable” while promoting a more open and balanced form of globalization. The Swiss economy has quickly felt the impact of the 39% tariffs imposed on exports by the United States in August, which is dependent on its advanced manufacturing and pharmaceutical industries. Trade tensions between Switzerland and the U.S. have already affected the nation’s manufacturing and export sectors. The recent alignment with China comes as the Swiss government fails to make progress in negotiations with Washington over the tariff burden. Swiss Foreign Minister Cassis emphasized that cooperation with China does not come at the expense of relations with Western allies. Cassis stressed the need for “predictable and balanced” globalization, saying: “We are committed to engaging with all partners constructively.” Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it.

CZ has directly addressed suspicions about BNB’s stability as most “blue-chip” altcoins fell significantly while BNB saw a minimal dip of around 2-3% before quickly recovering, outperforming its peers. In response to an X post that called attention to BNB’s “barely affected” performance, CZ wrote : “Fudders even try to make this sound like a bad thing? 😂🤷‍♂️Please post more of this about #BNB . 🙏” BNB is ‘SAFU’ The former Binance CEO has since been reposting tweets reflecting the same sentiment, including one that reminded people that BNB’s price was not affected even when “CZ was in the USA” because he “built a strong infrastructure called Community.” “New chain comers might not understand it, but we do. New comers will experience it. This is why i keep saying BNB & ASTER are SAFU and everything will be just FINE,” the tweet concluded. In response to another bullish tweet about BNB, CZ pointed out that BNB is one of the few projects that does not have a market maker. “I am not aware of any of my affiliated entities buying or selling #BNB in the past days / weeks,” he wrote before listing out BNB’s sound attributes, including its deflationary status. CZ is unbothered by the FUD While other blue-chip altcoins fell significantly during the peak of the liquidation event, with some falling as far as 80% in meme-heavy segments, BNB only fell by about 17% before rebounding. BNB price lost minimal value and quickly bounced back during a weekend that rocked most of the market. Source: Coinmarketcap Notably, BNB’s intraday loss outpaces its modest 7-day decline, signaling strong buying pressure re-emerging at key psychological levels despite the value hemorrhaging out of the markets. Also, CoinMarketCap data shows that BNB’s limited fall puts it alongside Bitcoin as one of the only top-five cryptocurrencies that have recorded minimal daily losses despite market liquidations exceeding $19 billion at the peak of the disaster. This confirms that there is active “flight-to-safety” rotation toward assets showing strength like BTC and BNB even as the market struggles to recover. As one user pointed out, one big reason why BNB has been able to defend its recent gains is its strong community. However, that’s not all. BNB also benefits from multiple demand catalysts, including trading fee discounts and increasing network revenue during heightened volatility, functions that make it an attractive hedge during events like the recent market crash. It is also important to note that CZ has always supported BNB with his massive platform, often encouraging builders and swatting down FUD. Both acts reassure holders and have translated into great strength for the token. Get seen where it counts.

Even though names like Shiba Inu (SHIB) are showing renewed instances of vibrancy, all the excitement today is around fresher names showing better potential gain. However, as bright as the potential for SHIB is within this cycle, the spotlight is quickly shifting over to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , one DeFi gem valued only $0.035 currently. Now in Phase 6 of presale, already sold out by over 65%, MUTM is grabbing whale attention with its dual-lending strategy combining conventional finance with DeFi lending optimization. By the new means to earn yields combined with strong early traction, many are predicting MUTM is going to make small bets big by earning life-changing profit by the price all the way up to $1 by 2026. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Targets $0.00005 Shiba Inu (SHIB) seems set up to anticipate the reversal from the current trending direction after staying immobile for weeks. The token technically catches up near the potential floor support level at $0.0000108, where the buyers have traditionally fractured the price to rescue. If the floorhold stands good for the token, experts believe that the price will skyrocket up to the reversal level around $0.0000176, translating to resistance. The news will pave the way up for the general bullish breakdown, propelling speculations up to the much-awaited $0.00005 mark. However, most mature investors are shifting their focus from projects with deteriorating fundamentals and usability to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi behemoth. Mutuum Finance Dominates in Q4 Mutuum Finance’s presale is currently in Phase 6, having raised so far over $17.25 million and attained 16,860 investors. That is an indication of increasing confidence towards the project’s future and makes Mutuum Finance a very viable ecosystem for investors aiming for sustainable return and long-term profit. The protocol also includes an active Loan-to-Value (LTV) framework and liquidation process that respond automatically to price shock to impose firmness amidst fluctuations. Reserve multipliers ranging from 10% to 35%, varied according to collateral risk profiles, also incorporate an additional level of surety, hence making the platform firmer as well. MUTM also includes a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program whose vulnerability classification is comprised of four levels, namely the critical, the major, the minor, and the low. This is supplemented by the open architecture design of the platform architecture combined with security-by-design, making the DeFi protocol secure, stable, and robust for the users. Mutuum Finance Borrowing & Lending Protocol The platform is soon launching a game-changing lending and borrowing protocol . The protocol’s Version 1 (V1) will be launched on Sepolia Testnet within Q4 2025 with key functionalities including the liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will have day-one support for the borrowing, lending, and collateralization, the users will be able to have an open-ended, scalable, and efficient DeFi experience. With the market gaining pace, the best investment suggestion for investors investing $1,000 is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM at just $0.035 today is set to skyrocket past $1, far outshining Shiba Inu. Already raising an impressive $17.25M from over 16,860 investors, the dual-lending strategy, active mechanism for LTV, and security-minded design of Mutuum make it sit among the big boys within the DeFi.

From meme coin mania, DeFi, AI, and RWAs, Solana has managed to capture several on-chain revenue streams that Ethereum couldn’t monetize early, a new report suggests. Solana’s Early Growth Curve According to 21Shares, the blockchain generated roughly $2.85 billion in revenue between October 2024 and September 2025, after averaging nearly $240 million per month. Peaks during periods of intense trading activity were found to be more than $600 million, with January 2025 marking the absolute high point at $616 million. This surge was driven largely by meme coin mania, including coins like Trump Coin. Even after the speculative frenzy cooled, Solana’s monthly revenues have remained in the $150 million-$250 million range. Such sustained figures demonstrated that the chain’s success “is not merely a speculative flash in the pan.” A closer look at the revenue composition reveals a highly diversified ecosystem. Trading applications such as Photon and Axiom contributed $1.12 billion, or 39% of the total, by facilitating faster swaps, advanced execution, and high-frequency activity. Beyond trading, Solana’s infrastructure supports a broad spectrum of DeFi, AI, DePin, and tokenized real-world asset applications. Its architecture, capable of thousands of transactions per second at sub-$0.01 costs, has effectively transformed Solana into a 24/7, global “on-chain Nasdaq,” which has helped it rival long-established Web 2 companies like Palantir ($2.8 billion in 2024) and Robinhood ($2.95 billion) in annual revenue. Perspective Check The contrast with Ethereum during its formative years couldn’t be more obvious. Between 2019 and 2020, roughly four to five years after Ethereum’s launch, monthly revenue averaged less than $10 million, which is less than 5% of what Solana now produces on a monthly basis. In peak months, Solana’s revenue has outpaced Ethereum’s early numbers by more than 50x. While Ethereum’s growth was constrained by congestion and modest gas fee revenue in a nascent DeFi ecosystem, Solana has leveraged high throughput and low fees to monetize a broader range of activity much earlier in its lifecycle. Daily active addresses on Solana now consistently hit 1.2-1.5 million, compared to Ethereum’s 400,000-500,000 during its early years. Solana’s revenue growth has not been linear. 21Shares found that just two years ago, between October 2022 and September 2023, total network revenue stood at a mere $13 million, which can be attributed to early skepticism amid outages and market turbulence. The 220x increase over the past 12 months, however, was a shift from experimental blockchain to a commercially viable ecosystem. Soon after, institutional interest followed suit. Currently, over $3 billion in SOL is held on public company balance sheets, and multiple treasury initiatives are underway from firms including Forward Industries, Pantera Capital, and Brera Holdings.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.6347 Market cap $632.56M Trading volume (24-hour) $24.76M Circulating supply 1.06B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.6027 24-hour low $0.5609 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.89% 50-day SMA $0.7227 14-Day RSI 29.32 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-day SMA $0.7064 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos is up 9%, showing early signs of recovery. Immediate resistance lies at $0.67. Short term indicators support momentum building. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart Tezos (XTZ) is trading around $0.6319, up 9.02% after a significant recovery from last week’s deep losses. The daily candle for October 12 shows renewed buying strength, pushing price above the lower Bollinger band at $0.5931. The mid-band resistance at $0.6745 is now the next hurdle for continuation. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD histogram shows fading bearish momentum. OBV has also started turning up slightly, suggesting that buyers are beginning to accumulate again after the recent capitulation move. If Tezos manages a daily close above $0.64–$0.65, continuation toward $0.67–$0.68 becomes likely. However, a rejection from this area could see price retreat back to $0.59, where short-term support now sits. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Tezos is showing gradual upward momentum, currently holding near $0.637. The Alligator lines have begun to realign positively, with the green line curling above the red and closing the gap with the blue base , a sign of an early trend shift. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The RSI sits around 52, reflecting modest bullish momentum and room for further gains before becoming overbought. Volume remains steady, confirming that buyers are gradually regaining control. The immediate resistance lies at $0.65–$0.67, where the upper Alligator band and prior breakdown zone align. A breakout above this range could propel price toward $0.70. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6633 SELL SMA 5 $0.6829 SELL SMA 10 $0.7129 SELL SMA 21 $0.6991 SELL SMA 50 $0.7227 SELL SMA 100 $0.7511 SELL SMA 200 $0.7064 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6978 SELL EMA 5 $0.7115 SELL EMA 10 $0.7359 SELL EMA 21 $0.7666 SELL EMA 50 $0.7677 SELL EMA 100 $0.7367 SELL EMA 200 $0.7435 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos has bounced strongly from oversold conditions, showing early signs of stabilization. The key test now sits at $0.67, and a break above this level would confirm a short-term bullish reversal. Until that happens, upside potential remains limited, and traders should watch the $0.60 support zone to gauge the strength of the recovery. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coingecko Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite its partnership milestones, Tezos (XTZ) had a bearish 2024. The coin peaked at $1.4 in April but dropped about 60% by August. Buyers returned in September, driving the price to $0.7015, and momentum carried into November with a peak of $1.856. The rally extended to December, when XTZ reached $1.909 before corrections brought the year-end close to $1.286. XTZ peaked at $1.49 in January 2025 before dropping to an average of $0.72 in February. From March to May, it consolidated below $0.70 with an overall average of $0.66. In June, it traded between $0.4752 and $0.6362, while July averaged $0.7232. August opened at $0.7605 and averaged $0.8212.

According to release notes shared by Bitcoin Core, the update brings performance improvements and bug fixes. However, many devs and Bitcoin supporters are opposing an update to OP_RETURN, which lets users attach data of up to 100,000 bytes (100KB) instead of the previous 83 byte limit. What are the major changes in Bitcoin Core v30.0? One of the major updates in Bitcoin Core is lower default fees. Nodes can relay transactions between peers with fees as low as 0.1 sat/vB. Miners, on the other hand, will be able to include transactions in the next block with a minimum fee of 0.001 sat/vB. OP_RETURN, which lets Bitcoin users attach data, like special messages, has more room to attach data, from 83 bytes to 100KB. OP_RETURN has multiple outputs instead of the previous single output. The increase in data limit lets users attach hashes, certificates, or even art metadata. Moreover, Bitcoin Core v30.0 no longer supports BDB wallets. Users must migrate to descriptor wallets, which are safer and easier to back up. Wallet commands such as importwallet and dumpwallet are also gone . The update also brings TRUC transactions, which avoid transaction conflicts while they wait for confirmation. Another new command is bitcoin, which simplifies how node operators and miners interact with Bitcoin Core. Also , typing bitcoin node, bitcoin gui, or bitcoin rpc replaces multiple older commands. Miners can connect directly to Bitcoin Core with an experimental PC Mining Interface, which works through local sockets, making block template requests faster . The graphical user interface (GUI) received multiple updates as well . The graphical toolkit was updated from Qt5 to Qt6 . Dark mode for Windows users is now supported, and on macOS, the Metal graphics are available for smoother performance. Other updates include fixing five low-severity bugs. The full details of bug fixes will be released within two weeks. Any node operating Bitcoin Core v27.x will no longer receive newer updates since v27.x is now labeled “End of Life” according to release notes from Bitcoin Core. What’s the controversy about Core v30.0? The increase of OP_RETURN’s data limit from 83 bytes to 100,000 bytes (100KB) received heavy criticism from developers and Bitcoin supporters. As mentioned above, OP_RETURN now lets users attach more data and allows multiple OP_RETURN outputs in one transaction. The Bitcoin Knots community, led by developer Luke Dashjr and Bitcoin Mechanic, opposed the new changes to OP_RETURN. They argued that increasing the data limit could force node operators to host illegal or harmful content, such as explicit material or malicious code. This could pose legal issues for node operators. The Knots community believes that Bitcoin should focus on money transfer, not file storage. In contrast, Bitcoin Core developers say the changes only adjust the memory pool (mempool) policy. It will not affect Bitcoin’s consensus rules. In September, Bitcoin Core developers planned to deprecate user control over the OP_RETURN data limit. That would have forced node operators to accept higher data limits without the option to reduce them. After backlash, Core maintainer Ava Chow restored user configurability over the data limits just before the October release window. The decision temporarily ended fears of forced settings. But the feature could be implemented in future versions. The update also changed how the -datacarriersize setting works. In older versions, a number like 83 represented an 83-byte limit, but in v30 the same value allows 9x more data. Critics say this silent change misleads users. For now, v30 keeps the new 100 KB default while still letting users manually lower it. Is Bitcoin going to fork? In late September, leaked messages suggested that Luke Dashjr might consider a temporary hard fork of Bitcoin to resist the new OP_RETURN data limit changes. TheRage claimed Dashjr was exploring a fork to protect node operators from potentially illegal data spreading through the network. But Dashjr denied the claims, calling the reports “fake news.” He said he was not planning any fork and that “there is no hard fork.” Still, he maintained his opposition to the new rules and accused “Core30 apologists” of being the only ones proposing forks. TheRage publication stood by its reporting, pointing out that neither Dashjr nor his colleagues disputed the authenticity of the leaked messages.

His remarks came after Ethena Labs’ synthetic dollar, USDe , briefly depegged amid the most severe liquidation cascade in the digital asset market’s history, which was triggered by President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs on Chinese imports on October 10. In a post on X , Ardoino declared that “USDT is the best collateral for derivatives and margin trading. Liquid, tested by fire.” He added, in characteristic flair, that those using “low liquidity tokens, some bananas, a horse, 3 olives and a chewed bubblegum” as collateral should “brace yourself when the market moves.” USDe’s flash depeg exposes structural fragility Ethena Labs’ USDe, a $14 billion “synthetic” stablecoin ranked third by market capitalization, was among the hardest hit in the midst of the crisis. USDe maintains its dollar peg through a derivatives-based hedging structure that combines spot crypto holdings with offsetting short futures positions, which is very different from Tether’s USDT or Circle’s USDC, both fiat-backed by cash and Treasury reserves. Comparison of USDe’s dollar peg on Curve and Binance. Source: Guy Young ( @gdog97_ ) on X During the turmoil, USDe’s price on Binance plunged as low as $0.65 following what Ethena described as an internal pricing discrepancy in the exchange’s spot market. On-chain liquidity pools such as Curve, Fluid, and Uniswap, by contrast, showed only minor deviations, which weren’t up to 30 basis points, similar to spreads between USDC and USDT. Binance’s degraded performance exacerbated the dislocation. It affected BNSOL, the Binance-issued Solana liquid staking token, and WBETH, the wrapped Beacon liquid staking token. According to Guy Young , Ethena Labs founder, Ethena’s mint and redeem function processed “more than $1b in a few hours and $2b in a 24-hour period with zero issues.” Young post on X implied that the depeg was a Binance-specific glitch rather than a structural failure of USDe itself. He proposed improved oracle designs to prevent forced liquidations during short-lived price distortions and suggested that pegging to USDT rather than USD during periods of stress could have mitigated the incident. Binance’s chief executive officer, Richard Teng, later apologized for the performance of the platform and its impact on users during the heat of Friday’s market capitulation and promised to compensate affected users, acknowledging that “there are no excuses” for its performance during the event. Tether touts durability as rivals stumble For Ardoino, the incident provided an opportunity to contrast USDT with other players in the market. USDT, now with more than $179 billion in circulation, weathered the rout without deviation, a fact Ardoino was quick to highlight. His post fits within an effort to position Tether as crypto’s foundational layer of liquidity and reliability, following years of scrutiny over its reserves and transparency. Ardoino has made a point of emphasizing Tether’s conservative asset management and swift redemption record, describing the token as battle-tested. His comment on the other low-liquidity tokens is quite sardonic; however, the market appears to have validated his claim. After the crash: lessons in collateral and design The October 10 event has already entered crypto lore as the “Tariff Crash,” both for its geopolitical trigger and for the staggering $19 billion in forced liquidations it produced, the largest in digital asset history. Analysts say the sell-off exposed how heavily the market still depends on leverage and centralized pricing feeds. Ethena’s measured handling of redemptions earned it cautious praise from some investors, but the episode highlighted how even sophisticated hedging systems remain vulnerable to exchange-specific distortions. Calls are growing for decentralized oracles that derive prices from deep-liquidity pools rather than individual venues and for real-time proof-of-collateral monitoring to identify early signs of stress.

The Russian media outlet RBC reported that domestic industry insiders say the blockchain-powered solution would be “feasible and attractive to foreign investors.” Vladimir Chistyukhin, the First Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, spoke about the matter on the sidelines of a recent financial forum. When asked about the tokenization of Russian shares, the Central Bank executive responded with a positive response, calling it a “possible option.” Vladimir Chistyukhin, the First Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Central Bank. (Source: MGIMO/YouTube/Screenshot) Russia’s Central Bank: Tokenization Could Help Firms Evade Sanctions However, Chistyukhin suggested that overseas players would need to provide technical and platform-based solutions. He said: “In this area, foreign partners will be playing a significant role. I am talking about the foreign entities who are willing to tokenize Russian assets in order to buy and sell them abroad.” Chistyukhin’s comments come hot on the heels of a proposal from Sergei Shvetsov, the head of the Moscow Exchange’s Supervisory Board. In late September this year, Shvetsov said that overseas investors want to buy Russian shares. And he said that tokenization would help them do so, as the solution does not make use of “sanctioned infrastructure.” Shvetsov went on to explain that decision-makers in Moscow have been openly talking about the tokenization of Russian shares. The exchange appears to believe that traditional finance-powered solutions tend to make use of “sanctioned infrastructure and sanctioned intermediaries and brokers.” These, he said, were “unfortunately common in Russia today.” Tokenization, he added, was one of several possible workarounds under consideration. Russian Experts Back Plans RBC quoted an official from the Russian banking group Sovcombank as voicing support for the plan. The Sovcombank official said that tokenization “could become a suitable tool for investors” from investors in BRICS countries or “friendly jurisdictions like the UAE, Kazakhstan, or Armenia.” Sovcombank offices in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Gennady Grachev [CC BY 2.0]) In the long term, the official added, tokenization could “accelerate the Russian market’s integration into the global digital financial system.” Alexey Korolenko, the Executive Director of Cifra Markets, concurred. He said that tokenization would allow traders with limited capital to buy fractions of stocks with a high market value per share. Korolenko added that the real-world assets (RWAs) sector is now going “mainstream,” and is now “in high demand among investors.” He concluded that the idea of tokenizing Russian shares was “entirely feasible.” But Korolenko warned that Moscow must ensure that providers meet reliability requirements “for the entire ownership and tokenization chain.” Experts also said regulators would need to consider infrastructure and liquidity matters, as well as possible “political risks.” The post Russia’s Central Bank: Tokenization Will Let Foreigners Buy Domestic Shares appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Russia|Tokenization,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|FIAT|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-12 23:30:00

The AI startup is taking on rivals like Meta and Google in developing next-generation AI that goes beyond text-based tools like ChatGPT or Grok. These models use data from videos and robots to learn how the real world behaves and could reshape how AI interacts with reality. Two people familiar with xAI’s work reportedly said the company plans to use these world models in gaming, building fully interactive 3D environments that respond like real spaces. Also, the same systems could later power AI robots, training them to move and react naturally. The company’s latest hires from Nvidia bring deep expertise in this area, making xAI a direct competitor in one of the most advanced AI fields yet. xAI strengthens team with Nvidia researchers to expand gaming and robotics goals xAI recruited Zeeshan Patel and Ethan He, two Nvidia researchers with experience developing simulation-based AI. Nvidia has long led the charge with its Omniverse platform, which allows developers to create detailed, physics-based simulations. Some technology companies believe world models could eventually transform AI into something that functions across both digital and physical products, including humanoid robots. Nvidia recently told the Financial Times that the potential global market for world models could reach the size of the entire world economy. That’s the scale of ambition now driving this technology. Elon said on X that xAI plans to launch an AI-generated game before the end of next year, confirming a goal he first mentioned in 2024. The announcement sets a clear timeline for xAI’s gaming ambitions, tying together Musk’s push to merge simulation, creativity, and real-world interaction. This week, xAI released a new image and video generation model with what it called “massive upgrades,” available for free. The company said the model creates sharper videos with more natural motion. Unlike current systems like OpenAI’s Sora, which predicts frames from learned image data, world models are built to understand cause and effect – how gravity, objects, and space work in real time. This allows them to generate realistic movement and physics instead of just visuals. xAI launches hiring spree and doubles down on real-world AI training To expand its work, xAI is hiring technical staff for its “omni team,” which focuses on image, video, and audio generation. Job listings describe it as building AI experiences beyond text, including multimedia creation. The positions pay between $180,000 and $440,000 per year, depending on seniority. There’s also a job posting for a “video games tutor,” who will train Grok to produce and design video games. That role pays $45 to $100 per hour, aimed at helping users explore AI-assisted game creation. Elon joins Meta and Google in pushing toward world models, but the challenge remains steep. Training AI to replicate the real world requires massive datasets (footage, physics data, and 3D mapping) all of which are costly to gather and process. Even with access to Nvidia hardware and talent, xAI faces technical and financial hurdles to scale these systems effectively. Not everyone in the gaming world is convinced. Michael Douse, publishing head at Larian Studios, the developer behind Baldur’s Gate 3 , wrote on X that AI won’t solve the game industry’s “big problem,” which he said is about “leadership and vision.” He added that the sector doesn’t need “more mathematically produced, psychologically trained gameplay loops,” but rather “expressions of worlds that people are actually engaged with or want to engage with.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Tech|Elon Musk|xAI,EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-12 23:40:06
53059784,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=834486,1760313538,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53059784.jpeg,Binance shells out $283 after token depegs rock market,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/binance-shells-out-283-after-token-depegs/,"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it has reimbursed customers for a total of $283 million after a volatile Friday, during which several tokens on the exchange depegged or experienced unnatural price crashes. The compensatory measure was taken in the midst of the worst-ever single-day liquidation, which erased around $20 billion worth of leveraged exposure and sent shivers throughout the digital asset space. According to Binance customers, many altcoins dropped to $0 on Friday’s pullback, a trend observed across the entire trading platform. This event, which included IoTeX (IOTX), Cosmos (ATOM), and Enjin, caused widespread panic. However, Binance has ascertained that this was just a display glitch. In a Sunday statement, Binance explained that the incident was caused by a “display issue” in its trading interface. According to the exchange, recent updates to the trading pairs, such as IOTX/USDT, had reduced the number of decimal places allowed for minimum price movements. This change caused the platform’s system to display a $0 price when token values were too small to render correctly. “Certain trading pairs, such as IOTX/USDT, recently reduced the number of decimal places allowed for minimum price movement, causing the displayed prices in the user interface to be zero, which is a display issue and not due to an actual $0 price.” The explanation helped calm fears after screenshots of zero-value tokens flooded social media, adding to the panic during an already chaotic market downturn. Depegged tokens trigger Binance’s compensation effort Adding to the turbulence, three Binance Earn assets —Ethena’s synthetic dollar (USDe), Binance Solana liquid staking token (BNSOL), and Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH)—temporarily depegged from their intended prices. Ethena’s USDe, meant to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar, briefly dropped to $0.66 on Binance. The exchange said it has fully compensated users who were affected between 21:36 and 22:16 UTC on October 10. This includes traders using USDe, BNSOL, or WBETH as collateral in futures, margin, and loan markets, as well as users who suffered verified losses through Earn redemptions or internal transfers. Ethena Labs CEO Guy Young pushed back against claims that USDe had officially depegged, noting that the incident was confined to Binance. “It is not accurate to describe this as a USDe depeg when a single venue was out of line with the deepest pools of liquidity that experienced no abnormal price deviations whatsoever,” Young wrote on X. Speculation mounts over possible exploit as Binance denies external attack Amid the confusion, some market observers speculated that a coordinated exploit had targeted Binance. A trader known as ElonTrades suggested that attackers may have exploited Binance’s Unified Account feature, which utilizes internal order-book data rather than external oracle feeds. This design difference, according to the theory, created a vulnerability that could be manipulated to produce sudden price discrepancies. ElonTrades claimed the exploit triggered a cascade of liquidations on Binance, eventually spilling over to the broader market. However, Binance denied any evidence of an external attack, stating that “the extreme market downturn occurred before the depegging.” To address future risks, Binance said it would update its reference index by including asset redemption prices and introducing a soft price floor for USDe. These measures are designed to stabilize future trading activity during extreme volatility. Renewed scrutiny spurs calls for stricter oversight of centralized exchanges The chaos has renewed calls for greater transparency and oversight in centralized exchanges. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek publicly urged regulators to investigate the cause of the extreme price swings, arguing that such events undermine confidence in centralized trading platforms. Marszalek said centralized exchanges must ensure that retail investors are protected from technical and structural failures, emphasizing the need for consistent regulatory standards. Despite the turbulence, crypto markets staged a notable recovery over the weekend. BNB, Binance’s native token, rallied more than 11% in 24 hours, while The Block’s GM30 Index, which tracks the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, rose 6.8%. In a statement, Binance emphasized that it is still “reviewing and handling user cases” related to the depegging and liquidation events. The exchange also pledged to reinforce infrastructure resiliency, work on transparency, and continue to provide customers with confidence following one of the most turbulent events in recent crypto history. Having already paid out damages of $283 million to impacted clients, Binance is attempting to demonstrate that it can respond quickly in the wake of a crisis and provide reassurance to customers while proving its resilience amid fast-paced market changes.

From Ethereum to BullZilla, each of these projects has a compelling story and a growing community behind it. Whether you’re a finance student, developer, meme coin addict, or seasoned analyst, these five tokens deserve your radar. 1. BullZilla ($BZIL): A Presale Beast Built for Big Returns The BullZilla presale is catching fire. With a price of $0.00014574, over 31 billion tokens already sold, 2,800+ holders, and $860K+ raised, it’s more than just hype; it’s traction. At the heart of its momentum is the staggering ROI potential. Based on its listing target of $0.00527141, early buyers stand to gain over 3500% if projections hold. This isn’t a pipe dream. The economics are clear, and the math adds up. What makes BullZilla ($BZIL) crypto presale stand out is its stage-based growth model. Stage 6B, currently live, locks in investors at an ideal entry. With every presale phase, token scarcity increases, which historically drives prices higher on launch. Beyond the tokenomics, BullZilla’s branding is designed to resonate with meme coin lovers but grounded enough to appeal to analysts and devs. The green candles? They’re only part of the story. It’s also backed by liquidity plans, audited contracts, and a roadmap loaded with DeFi integrations. If there’s a top crypto to join now that could break out meme-style while offering institutional-grade structure, this is it. 2. Chainlink (LINK): The Backbone of Smart Contract Infrastructure Chainlink has moved from a niche oracle provider to a pillar of Web3 infrastructure. As smart contracts evolve, they need reliable data feeds — and that’s where LINK thrives. Chainlink’s value lies in its real-world adoption. It’s being integrated into DeFi, insurance, gaming, and even TradFi sectors. With the recent launch of Chainlink CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol), it’s poised to be the bridge between blockchains and traditional financial systems. While not a presale, LINK offers stability and long-term upside. Analysts from Messari and IntoTheBlock have consistently rated LINK as undervalued based on on-chain metrics and network activity. Though it may not offer 3500% upside like BZIL, LINK provides a lower-risk entry into infrastructure investing. For students and financial analysts looking for tech-backed plays, Chainlink remains a strong bet. 3. MoonBull (MOBU): The Staking Revolution That Rewards Conviction MoonBull is turning heads by merging meme coin enthusiasm with DeFi mechanics that reward holding. Its 23-stage scarcity model creates deflationary pressure, while its Ethereum foundation ensures security. But where MoonBull truly innovates is in its staking rewards — up to 95% APY through its AI-based optimizer. This tool adjusts rewards in real-time based on market volatility, giving holders consistent earnings without active management. The presale structure supports value growth, reinforced by instant referral bonuses and permanently locked liquidity. As the best upcoming crypto to join in 2025, MoonBull is building something deeper than memes. It’s a hybrid, part entertainment, part yield-generating machine. For devs and analysts, the real hook is its verified smart contract and upcoming cross-chain staking. This project doesn’t just want hype: it wants utility, governance, and global adoption. 4. La Culex (CULEX): The Meme Coin Built on Smart Tokenomics La Culex (CULEX) is an upcoming meme coin project. With a max supply of 200B and 45% allocated to presale, its tokenomics are built for sustained value appreciation. Its presale structure splits tokens across 32 phases. Each completed stage makes the token rarer, pushing its price closer to a $0.007 listing target. That’s an exponential opportunity for early buyers. Add to that an 80% APY via the Hive Vault, and a 12% referral bonus through the Bite Chain, and La Culex becomes a community-driven ecosystem with real rewards. With no transaction tax, locked liquidity, and audited contracts, it’s ticking all the boxes for safety. For anyone asking which top crypto to join now, La Culex offers a unique upcoming meme token with built-in longevity and growth. 5. Ethereum (ETH): The King That Keeps Evolving No serious list is complete without Ethereum. It’s the Layer-1 backbone of DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and more. But what keeps ETH attractive in 2025 is its shift to proof-of-stake, which drastically reduced its energy usage and circulating supply. ETH staking is now mainstream, and the introduction of L2s like Optimism and Arbitrum is solving the scalability problem of ETH. According to Glassnode, ETH’s staking deposits are at an all-time high, showing confidence in its long-term potential. ETH may not 50x from here, but it’s the reserve asset of Web3. For analysts and developers, ETH offers both innovation and stability. It’s a slow burner, not a moonshot, but one with fundamental strength. Conclusion: The Window of Opportunity Is Narrowing For those wondering which top crypto to join now, the answer is increasingly evident. BullZilla ($BZIL) isn’t just gaining traction, it’s racing ahead. With over $860K raised, a presale structure that rewards early adopters, and a projected 3500% ROI, it offers a rare combination of meme coin energy and solid fundamentals. Yet, it’s not alone. MoonBull and La Culex are pushing boundaries with staking innovations and community-first tokenomics. Chainlink and Ethereum, while more established, continue to be pillars of long-term growth. Whether you’re chasing the next breakout or building a diversified portfolio, these five projects represent the sharpest edges of the crypto frontier. The timing? Now. Because in a space that moves this fast, waiting often costs more than acting early.

53060482,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=834490,1760314765,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53060482.jpeg,Singapore to keep policy steady as inflation cools,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/singapore-to-keep-policy-steady/,"Singapore’s central bank is likely to hold monetary policy steady this week, citing low inflation and ongoing US trade uncertainties, while domestic growth remains stable. A recent survey revealed that 16 out of 20 economists anticipate the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will maintain its current policy settings. On the other hand, four economists, including some from DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and TD Securities, speculate that the bank might begin easing its policy again after maintaining it unchanged during its final review in July. Central banks adopt different strategies to support their country’s economic growth The MAS carefully reviews its policy four times annually. In January and April, the agency loosened its policy setting to support the country’s uncertain economic status, as it encountered slowdowns and risks that required cautious navigation. Unlike most central banks , which prefer adjusting interest rates in the event of growing uncertainties, Singapore’s central bank’s main aim is to stabilize prices by controlling the rise of its dollar based on trade. This act follows the central banks’ new decision to adopt different operational strategies. To support this claim, reliable sources report that Indonesia and New Zealand are further reducing their interest rates to enhance the countries’ economic growth. At the same time, Thailand, Malaysia, and Australia keep their rates steady as they thoroughly examine the impacts of previous changes. The US Federal Reserve, on the other hand, had earlier lowered borrowing costs for the first time since December last year. Concerning the situation, Lloyd Chan, a Senior Currency Analyst at MUFG’s Global Markets Research in Singapore, commented that the central bank appears to be holding off on any additional action until it identifies any signs of economic decline. Escalating trade tensions between the US and China also shape Singapore’s policy outlook. The US-China trade conflict has escalated as Beijing retaliates to US tariff policies with restrictions on the exports of rare-earth minerals. Regarding the US’s tariff policies, US President Donald Trump made public his intentions to impose additional tariffs and set up limitations on software sales to China. With this escalation, companies are getting ready for any potential interruption. China’s commerce ministry blamed Washington for raising trade tensions between the two countries after Trump announced on Friday that he would impose additional tariffs on China’s exports to the US, along with new controls on critical software, by November 1 . “Wilful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China,” a spokesperson for the commerce ministry said on Sunday, according to the state news agency Xinhua. “China’s position on the trade war is consistent. We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it. According to the spokesperson, while China does not seek a trade war, it will defend its interests if the US continues down this path. US stock index increased, signaling a breather after the worst dip since April, as Trump’s administration signaled openness to a trade deal following tensions between Washington and Beijing that shot up last week. Contracts on the S&P 500 advanced 0.9% as of 7:01 p.m. in New York, while Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.2%. After trade tensions between the world’s two leading economies began on Friday and over the weekend, US Vice President JD Vance told Beijing to “choose the path of reason,” threatening that Trump has more leverage if the fight does not come to an end. Singapore’s economy demonstrates signs of recovery, boosting the Singapore dollar Despite growing tension in the market, analysts have highlighted some bright spots in Singapore’s economy. To illustrate this, consumer spending grew more than expected in August and manufacturing activity increased to 56.4 last month, marking its eighth month of significant growth. Aditionally, private home prices posted their largest gain in three quarters, led by a jump in sales of new apartments. This rise and growing interest in safe regional investments have boosted the Singapore dollar. While it has gained more than 5% against the US dollar this year, it has remained relatively stable since MAS’s last decision at the end of July. However, Singapore’s core inflation continued to decline in August for the second month in a row. Concerning this, officials upheld the belief that price increases of imported goods will remain moderate soon. Afterwards, they forecasted that the core inflation will average between 0.5% and 1.5% this year.

53061178,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=834498,1760315693,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53061178.jpeg,Bank deregulation set to unlock $2.6tn of Wall Street lending capacity,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wall-street-2-6-trillion-in-lending-capacity/,"Wall Street is about to get a historic boost. New findings from Alvarez & Marsal show that the Trump administration’s deregulation drive will open up nearly $2.6 trillion in new lending power for U.S. banks. The rollback of post-crisis capital rules, those designed after the Great Recession in 2008, is expected to free $140 billion in locked capital for America’s biggest lenders, setting off pressure on regulators in Europe and Asia to reconsider their own limits. Since Donald Trump returned to the White House nine months ago, U.S. regulators have eased constraints that once forced banks to maintain large loss-absorbing buffers. The updated rules will strengthen the position of many Wall Street giants, allowing them to channel more money into AI, data centers, and energy infrastructure while also boosting shareholder payouts. The policy reversal will benefit the largest financial institutions far more than regional banks struggling with credit costs and liquidity tightening. Trump’s deregulation drive unlocks massive lending firepower Fernando de la Mora, co-head of financial services at Alvarez & Marsal, said Trump is “kicking off a major wave of deregulation, unlocking a huge amount of capacity, which will give a massive economic boost and an earnings uplift.” The consultancy’s data shows a 14% cut in common equity tier one capital requirements for American banks, a rule that dictates how much equity must be held against losses. That reduction alone could lift earnings per share by 35% and returns on tangible common equity by 6%, helping banks scale credit and push deeper into high-yield markets like crypto and AI financing. The full report details how similar deregulation might ripple through other markets, as the U.K. is expected to trim bank capital requirements by 8%, likely to preserve competitiveness with the U.S. But EU regulators are taking a different path, preparing to raise requirements by 1%, while Switzerland is set for an even bigger jump of up to 33%. The Swiss proposal could force UBS to raise $26 billion in fresh capital after rescuing Credit Suisse, a move aimed at preventing another financial shock. “This is going to drive a further market share gain by U.S. banks,” de la Mora added, saying U.K. banks would maintain ground while Swiss and EU lenders lose momentum. With looser restrictions and billions in freed-up funds, Wall Street is positioned to outpace global rivals as the balance tilts back toward U.S. dominance. Federal Reserve and regulators back easing despite global concern JPMorgan Chase will likely see the biggest payoff, with an estimated $39 billion in capital released from its balance sheet. That will raise its earnings per share by 31% and its return on equity by 7%, giving it extra flexibility to lend and invest. Within Washington, Michelle Bowman, newly appointed vice-chair of supervision at the Federal Reserve, has been one of the loudest voices for loosening capital rules. She has criticized the strict standards of the past decade, arguing they “pushed lending into private credit markets” and reduced traditional banking activity. Regulators have already outlined plans to relax requirements for banks to hold fixed levels of high-quality capital relative to total assets. They also intend to change the extra capital buffers for the biggest banks and redesign the annual stress tests that limit risk-taking. Huw van Steenis, vice-chair of Oliver Wyman, said, “There is a capital investment boom in the U.S. to be financed — for AI, data centers, energy infrastructure and some reshoring. This recalibration of regulation will help banks lean into this financing wave.” His comment reflects the private sector’s anticipation of a massive credit expansion as the rules ease. But not everyone is on board. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, warned against a “regulatory rollback” that could endanger financial stability. Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, added that regulators must avoid “the baby being thrown out with the bathwater” as they adjust oversight. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

However, while Solana’s momentum shines so bright, investors are questioning how high the rally will be able to reach, specifically as new projects are already promising much larger potential upsurges. None is better compared to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , the DeFi rising-star project presale currently under Phase 6, valued only at $0.035. The DeFi dual-lending protocol platform presented by Mutuum Finance gives users the capability to gain yields under a safer, streamlined ecosystem. With an estimated $1 potential growth by 2026 by the experts, early investors believe MUTM is the next-gen DeFi token capable of rivaling, if not surging past, Solana’s early growth curve. Solana Eyes the Next Move Up to $300 Solana (SOL) seems to be riding on past glory having finished a five-wave upswing from the September lows opting instead for the onset of healthy corrective correction. Presently commentators are speculating on two probable outcomes, namely SOL runs into the $214–$208 buying area only to reel off later toward the subsequent rally leg, or ends early and takes off straight into the subsequent rally leg. In either case, market configuration is bullish for continued movement to the bullish side, with analysts speculating on a breakout that will ultimately take SOL up to the $300 level sometime in the next few weeks. But for investors aiming for diversification into promising projects, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), one emerging DeFi performer is making strong strides. Mutuum Finance Presale Hype Gains Steam Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investor attention this week following tremendous speed in Phase 6 of presale. The tokens are currently valued at $0.035, up by a 16.17% increment from the previous round. Over 16,860 investors have already purchased generating over $17.25 million, healthfully depicting an emerging market confidence in the bright DeFi future of Mutuum Finance. With over 60% sold in Phase 6, early investors are acquiring their buy-ins before the next increment. A second cushion is offered by the shape of the reserve multiplier configuration, itself apportioned from 10% for small risk projects to 35% for high risk projects. The configuration underpins system resilience, dampens liquidation shocks, and insulates capital integrity. Even the collateral management is optimized, for eventual ultimate power-to-borrow by mutual complementing leveraging off the related holdings, with the ultimate bankruptcy risk elimination and overall platform health. Real-Time Data Through Chainlink Oracles For precise, stable pricing alongside risk calculation, Mutuum Finance is making use of Chainlink oracles for USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX feeds. Fallback oracles, advanced data feeds, and decentralized exchange TWAPs guarantee the valuation from the protocol remains precise even during record-record volatility or illiquid conditions. Mutuum’s lending and borrowing protocol is soon expected to go live. Version 1 (V1) is slated to come out on Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will have key components such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be provided at the launch for collaterals, lending, and borrowing and will give the users the efficient, scalable, and secure DeFi. The platform also provides floating-, fixed-, and floating/fixed-degree tools and balances the supply versus the demand for the liquids as well as stabilizes the ecosystem. Whereas Solana (SOL) is plotting a bullish continuation chart to $300, investors are setting their sights on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for even larger potential. At only $0.035 during Phase 6 of presale, more than 65% of the tokens have been sold so far, generating $17.25 million from more than 16,860 investors. By means of the dual-lending protocol on the Chain, oracle inclusion by Chainlink, and the reserve multiplier mechanism, the platform is providing tangible DeFi utility with great risk coverage. Analysts believe MUTM will reach $1 by 2026, including the token on their radar as the ultimate early-stage bet for the next crypto upcycle. Get on the Mutuum Finance presale today before Phase 6 closes.

In a statement dated October 13, the think tank noted that this reform is important because it will enable Reeves to collect more funds while minimizing the negative economic effects. Concerning the IFS’s advice to the chancellor, officials in the London-based research institute told Reeves not to increase the current tax rate to collect the extra funds she needs, which is approximately 30 billion pounds, equivalent to around $40 billion, to satisfy her goals for enhancing public finances. “What we really do not want in November is the encouragement of aimless changes and half-hearted solutions,” said Isaac Delestre, a senior research economist at the IFS. Delestre views November’s budget as a chance for real progress. Therefore, he urges the chancellor to use this budget to establish a more sensible tax system. Delestre urges Reeves to establish a more logical tax system Earlier, Reeves and Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, assured voters that they would not increase social security contributions, value-added tax , or income tax on employees. Additionally, they pledged not to raise the main tax on corporate profits. Last year, the UK chancellor increased social security costs for employers. However, after increasing these expenses, Reeves still has options to consider for the upcoming budget on November 26. This includes taxes on wealth and property. Regarding these considerations, the IFS pointed out that changing wealth-related taxes, such as capital gains tax, would be more impactful than adopting a new annual wealth tax. The think tank officials highlighted that they were aware some members of the ruling Labour Party opt for a new annual wealth tax. On the other hand, the IFS urged transferring local property tax responsibilities to regions like London for property-related taxes. According to the think tank, these regions have recently experienced increased house prices, and the relevant authorities have removed the stamp duty tax on property purchases. The leader of Britain’s opposition Conservative Party expressed their great support for eliminating the stamp tax last week. Apart from the IFS, another significant think tank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, commented on the topic of discussion. According to them, Reeves should focus on crucial matters, such as reassessing her earlier pledge not to increase employee taxes, rather than less important issues like finding effective methods to boost revenue. Think tank officials call on Reeves to stick to her earlier commitment Think tank officials call on Reeves to reconsider her earlier pledge not to raise taxes on working people because they believe this approach would be preferable to looking for other methods of raising revenue that could cause significant damage to the county’s economy. Following this, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research stated that alternative ways to raise the £30 billion, equivalent to approximately $40 billion, that Reeves will need are too disruptive to the economy. Meanwhile, in the UK, the government’s borrowing costs have risen more than expected. Moreover, a plan to save 5 billion pounds a year on welfare spending has been abandoned, and the country’s budget watchdog suggested that it might cut its growth forecasts. Still, Starmer and Reeves have repeatedly said for months that they are determined to honour their pre-election commitments, including at last month’s annual Labour Party conference. “A new wealth tax,” the NIESR added, citing a policy that some Labour lawmakers support, “is likely to reduce savings, increasing the cost of borrowing and discouraging investment.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",News|UK,EN,0,0,REGULATION|RESEARCH|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-13 01:44:55

Fully enacted in late 2024, MiCA set a harmonized regime for crypto asset providers across the 27-member bloc for the first time. No company was explicitly cited in the EBA statement. Still, it warned that attempts to circumvent these regulations could persist and carry substantial risks for the functioning of the EU’s financial system. EBA addresses several risks, including “forum shopping.” This refers to firms attempting to obtain regulatory approval in one country that they perceive as having less stringent approval mechanisms, so they can subsequently operate legally in other parts of the EU. This is also known as “ passporting .” According to the EBA report, before the adoption of MiCA , one unnamed entity submitted applications for registration and licensing in several states within a short timeframe. It further continued to withdraw from jurisdictions where authorities continuously probed or its application was challenged, before proceeding to operate in countries where it went unchallenged. EBA noted, “In practice, entities with weak AML/CFT controls have already entered and are operating in the EU market by selecting jurisdictions with lighter supervisory practices or previously lower market entry requirements.” MiCA transition period may allow unlicensed firms to continue operations While MiCA came fully into effect last year, it included a transition window that runs until July 1, 2026, giving firms some time to either get a license or be deemed non-compliant. According to the regulator, “emerging evidence suggests that there may be a risk that entities which were previously licensed in a Member State and have not met the authorisation conditions under MiCA but are appealing their case may continue to operate in the EU in the interim time.” Dr. Hendrik Müller-Lankow, a lawyer at the German crypto law firm Kronsteyn , states that, based on his experience, supervisory arbitrage and supervisory shopping are in fact occurring throughout the EU. He adds that this is a phenomenon regulators must accept if they want to establish a single market while still maintaining some level of supervisory authority. “It is well known that people—and thus also authorities—in different Member States have different mentalities when applying laws,” he added. Müller-Lankow believes the EU could tackle the issue by centralizing both its legislation and supervisory authorities. He noted much of this is already underway, and EU authorities are actively working to expand their powers. Lankow also highlighted that some crypto firms may be establishing themselves in the EU without transparent governance or clear beneficial ownership, making it difficult to determine accountability. Opaque structures in crypto firms heighten risk of illicit activity According to the EBA report, a virtual asset service provider, or VASP, that applied for an operating license in several EU jurisdictions was found by one crypto authority to “be jointly run by more than 20 distinct entities that were largely established outside the EU and outside regulatory oversight.” The EBA warns that such opaque structures may enable the misuse of front or shell companies. The independent EU agency added that entities that lack real economic activity can serve as drivers to channel illicit funds under the guise of legitimate transactions.” The EBA’s report highlights the continued difficulty faced by the EU in enforcing a common crypto regulatory framework. Although MiCA aims to provide the market with clarity and stability, areas of uncertainty and opaque corporate structures may persist. Regulators are facing increased pressure to intensify the regulation of crypto assets and enhance cooperation between member states, aiming to prevent digital tokens from being used for nefarious purposes, protect investors, and maintain the integrity of the EU financial system. With the transition phase extending into mid-2026, however, the next few months will be crucial in shaping MiCA’s potential to deliver on its promise of a fully harmonized and secure crypto market.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin is trading at $115,157, steady after a volatile weekend which began with the largest crypto liquidation event in history , while Ether rose to $4,146, extending its recovery from Friday’s lows near $3,700. Elsewhere, Solana gained 11% to $196, Bittensor surged 28%, and Cronos jumped 11%, according to CoinDesk market data, as capital rotated back into high-beta assets following a $20 billion leverage flush. Both Washington and Beijing worked to cool down trade tensions over the weekend , helping the recovery. Bitwise’s Jonathan Man points to positioning as the key factor: leverage was stretched across long-tail tokens, so when liquidity vanished, the wipeout was severe — but it cleared the decks for a faster reset. Staking also played a secondary role in cushioning the decline. With nearly 30% of ETH supply locked in validators but only a quarter of that circulating as liquid staking derivatives, the network’s structure created friction that slowed panic selling. Even as derivatives unwound, validator capital stayed put, blunting what could have been a full liquidity spiral. But as postmortems roll in, many fingers are pointing at Binance. Dragonfly's Haseeb Qureshi questions if Ethena really depegged, arguing that instead $60–$90 million in USDe, along with wBETH and BNSOL, was dumped on Binance, exploiting a pricing flaw that valued collateral using Binance’s own order book instead of external oracles. As Binance’s infrastructure buckled under heavy load, market makers were unable to hedge or rebalance positions, the thesis goes, causing wrapped assets to decouple from their underlying prices and deepening the selloff. The localized collapse drove USDe to $0.65 on Binance only, while it held near $1 on Curve and Bybit. Because Binance’s unified margin system marked collateral to its internal prices, the drop instantly wiped out hundreds of millions in margin value, triggering forced liquidations across assets. Ethena’s USDe protocol remained fully collateralized and redeemable throughout, suggesting the chaos was an exchange-side failure, not a stablecoin depeg. Binance has since acknowledged “platform-related issues,” moved to oracle-based collateral pricing, and pledged compensation for affected traders. In hindsight, Friday’s crash looks less like a stablecoin panic and more like a masterclass in exploiting an exchange's weakest structural link. In a post on X , Yi He, Binance's co-founder and chief customer service officer admitted that the exchange had brief service delays and temporary depegs in some yield products but said these occurred after the broader market drop. Binance added that over $280 million in compensation has already been paid to affected users and reaffirmed that it will not cover ordinary market losses. For now, crypto’s cleanout has given way to a measured rebound, one led by the assets that fell hardest and reset the deepest. Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin steadied around $115,000 after falling nearly 9% on Friday and recovering about 4% over the weekend as traders unwound shorts and broader risk sentiment began to stabilize. ETH: Ether rebounded to about $4,150 after dropping nearly 17% on Friday, recovering faster than Bitcoin as leveraged positions cleared and DeFi activity picked back up. Gold: Gold surged to a record $4,059.87 per ounce in early Asian trading on Monday as escalating U.S.–China trade tensions, renewed geopolitical risks, and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts fueled demand for safe-haven assets.

BTC is now struggling and might face hurdles near the $116,000 level. Bitcoin started a recovery wave above the $113,500 resistance level. The price is trading below $116,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $119,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down if it trades below the $113,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Starts Recovery Bitcoin price started a recovery wave after a massive liquidation event below $110,000. BTC recovered above the $111,500 and $112,000 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the sharp decline from the $123,750 swing high to the $100,000 low. The bulls even pushed the price above the $113,500 resistance level. However, there are many hurdles on the upside. Bitcoin is now trading below $116,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $119,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $116,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $116,250 level. The next resistance could be $118,000 and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the sharp decline from the $123,750 swing high to the $100,000 low. A close above the $118,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $119,500 resistance and the trend line. Any more gains might send the price toward the $120,000 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $122,500. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $116,000 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support is near the $114,000 level. The first major support is near the $113,500 level. The next support is now near the $113,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $112,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $110,500, below which BTC might struggle to recover in the short term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $113,500, followed by $112,500.
