What started as just another volatile day descended into chaos after the US imposed 100% tariffs on China, leaving the markets reeling. Bitcoin (BTC) plummeted to a low of $102,000 on Binance, with fears of a drop below $100,000, as the cryptocurrency market shed over 10% of its value amid plummeting prices. Market Carnage The cryptocurrency market suffered tremendous losses on Saturday, with over $19 billion wiped out, according to data from Coinglass. Coinglass described the crash as “the largest liquidation event in crypto history.” Markets crashed after President Trump imposed 100% tariffs on China and new export controls on software. The announcement triggered a steep decline in Bitcoin prices, which fell to a low of $102,000 on Binance. However, it has recovered since and is currently trading above $111,000. CoinGlass also reported that over 1.6 million traders were liquidated over the past 24 hours, with over $7 billion in positions sold in less than an hour on Friday. However, it noted that total losses could be significantly higher. Meanwhile, Binance suffered a major outage, adding to an already chaotic day. Many users reported frozen accounts, failed stop-loss orders, and flash crashes that briefly sent some altcoins to near zero. Experts have warned of a broader market contagion, with some estimates predicting total liquidations above $30 billion. Brian Strugats, head trader at Multicoin Capital, stated, “The focus is now on counterparty exposure and whether this triggers broader market contagion.” Meanwhile, Caroline Mauron, co-founder of Orbit Markets, put Bitcoin's next support line at $100,000, adding that a drop below this level could signal the end of the bull cycle. “A drop below this would signal the end of the past three-year bull cycle.” Crypto Community In Shock As Trader Shorts Bitcoin Right Before Crash The cryptocurrency community has been rocked by potential market manipulation after a trader shorted Bitcoin minutes before the market crash. According to crypto analyst Vivek Sen, the account was created on the same day of the crash, raising widespread suspicion and concern among the crypto community. “SOMEONE JUST OPENED A #BITCOIN SHORT 30 MINS BEFORE TRUMP'S TARIFF ANNOUNCEMENT AND JUST CLOSED WITH $88,000,000 PROFIT. HE OPENED THIS ACCOUNT TODAY.” Members of the cryptocurrency community have accused the trader of insider activity, with crypto attorney John Deaton calling for a full investigation. Saturday’s crash is one of the largest liquidation events in crypto history, triggered by the US government imposing 100% tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls on software. The announcement sent shockwaves through crypto and financial markets, with Bitcoin , Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies trading deep in the red. CoinGlass data revealed that $19 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated within 24 hours, with $7 billion of the liquidations occurring in just one hour on Friday. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has reclaimed $111,000 after suffering one of the largest crashes in its history, plunging to a low of $102,000 on Binance. The flagship cryptocurrency traded above $122,000 on Wednesday before dropping to $121,000 on Thursday. However, markets crashed after the US announced sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods and new export controls after China announced curbs on rare earth minerals. The developments caught traders off guard, sending shockwaves through the market. Experts believe there is a chance for the decline to spill over into next week after the weekend. Head of Markets Ray Salmond stated, “If we look at liquidation heatmap data from Hyblock Capital, which basically shows where all the short and long positions are across various orderbooks at centralized crypto exchanges, we can see that there’s a liquidity pocket of long positions that are being exploited…that pocket extends from $120,000 to $115,000 and from $115,000 to $113,000.” However, spot Bitcoin ETFs helped cushion the downside, reporting net inflows of $2.72 billion for the week ending Friday. The Kobeissi Letter commented on Friday’s selloff, stating, “Volume was so strong that it led to the first EVER $20,000 candlestick in Bitcoin, a -$380 BILLION drop in market cap, before a V-shaped bottom as shorts were closed. Not only was this the largest liquidation ever, it was nine times the previous record. This event will be referenced for years to come.” Spot Bitcoin ETFs reported net outflows of $4.5 million on Friday. BTC heads into a crucial week, with a Senate vote on a stopgap funding bill, which could act as a catalyst for price action. The flagship cryptocurrency could rebound if the funding bill passes. Markets will also be watching for US-China trade developments as the APEC summit nears. BTC started the weekend positively, registering a marginal increase and settling at $122,458. Bullish sentiment intensified on Sunday as the price rallied, surging past $125,000 to a new all-time high of $125,559. However, it could not stay at this level and ultimately settled at $123,520. BTC surged to a new all-time high on Monday, crossing $126,000 to reach $126,296 before settling at $124,720. Despite strong bullish momentum, BTC retreated on Tuesday, falling nearly 3% and settling at $121,393. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising almost 2% to reclaim $123,000 and settle at $123,343. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell to an intraday low of $119,713 before reclaiming $120,000 and settling at $121,714. Selling pressure intensified on Friday as President Trump imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, decimating investor sentiment. As a result, BTC fell as low as $102,000 on Binance before closing the day at $112,980. The price continued dropping on Saturday, falling to an intraday low of $109,683 before settling at $110,768. BTC is up almost 1% during the ongoing session, trading around $111,649. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Meanwhile, President Trump is contemplating a presidential pardon for Binance founder Changpeng Zhao. However, the administration is worried about the optics of such a decision. Here are the biggest stories of the week! Bitcoin Luxembourg's Intergenerational Sovereign Wealth Fund has allocated 1% of its portfolio to Bitcoin ETFs and other crypto assets. The decision, announced by finance minister Gilles Roth, makes Luxembourg the first country in the Eurozone to invest in Bitcoin through its sovereign fund. Crypto entrepreneur Roger Ver , popularly called “Bitcoin Jesus,” reached a deal with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) to have his tax evasion case dropped. Ver was arrested in April 2024 and charged with mail fraud, tax evasion, and filing false tax returns. Ethereum Crypto asset manager Grayscale has enabled staking for its US Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and its Ethereum Mini Trust ETF products. The decision allows investors to earn additional yield on their holdings. The asset manager has also activated staking for the Grayscale Solana Trust (GSOL). Business Web3 wallet MetaMask has introduced perpetual contract trading after launching in-wallet access to Hyperliquid’s DEX market. The feature will help MetaMask establish itself as an all-in-one self-custodial trading and investment hub for global finance. Dogecoin treasury company CleanCore announced that it holds 710 million DOGE worth $188 million. The company aims to hold 1 billion DOGE and is backed by the Dogecoin Foundation. Intercontinental Exchange , the parent entity of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), has announced a $2 billion stake in prediction market platform Polymarket. The move marks its foray into event-driven markets and enhances the platform’s credibility in the US. RWA tokenization platform Ondo Finance completed the acquisition of Oasis Pro, a regulated digital asset broker-dealer and alternative trading system (ATS). The deal allows Ondo Finance to develop and provide tokenized securities markets in the US. Web3 NEAR has developed the Intents framework for seamless, multichain execution. Intents utilizes solvers and chain signatures to create a process that feels as simple as a token swap. For developers, Intents enables the creation of dApps that can interact with multiple chains. Developers can also access the tooling and libraries that come bundled with Intents. Decrypt has partnered with Opera, bringing Decrypt’s breaking news and industry analysis directly into the Opera browser. Regulation The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will formalize an “innovation exemption” for crypto and digital asset companies by the end of the year. The exemption will allow companies to leverage digital assets and other innovative technologies in the US. President Trump is reportedly considering a presidential pardon for Binance founder Changpeng Zhao . A presidential pardon could restore Zhao’s reputation in the cryptocurrency industry and clear the path for a return to Binance. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

On May 17, 2023, Tether said it would regularly allocate up to 15% of net realized operating profits to purchase bitcoin for reserves, adding BTC to surplus rather than using it to back circulating USDT one-for-one. The company framed the move as strengthening its balance sheet with a long-term store of value. BTC and gold as parallel pillars Gold sits alongside bitcoin in that mix. Tether issues tether gold (XAUt), a token backed by allocated bars, and said on July 24 that more than 7.66 tons of metal backed outstanding tokens as of June 30, 2025. Separately, as CoinDesk reported on Sept. 5, 2025, citing the Financial Times, Tether has held talks to invest across the gold value chain — from mining and refining to royalties — as part of a broader diversification push. Ardoino has grouped the assets rhetorically before. On Sept. 7, he referenced bitcoin, gold and land as hedges and later dismissed suggestions that Tether sold BTC to accumulate gold, saying the firm remained committed to growing its bitcoin position. Today's eight-word post is less a policy shift than a restatement — bitcoin as a strategic asset added with profits, and gold as a parallel pillar via tokenization and potential upstream investments — while most reserves remain in liquid instruments such as U.S. Treasurys per attestations. The next reserve report, expected late this month or early next month, will show whether allocations to BTC and gold have changed. As of Sunday, 8:10 p.m. UTC, the U.S. dollar index (DXY) was down 8.88% year to date, while bitcoin and gold — BTC-USD and XAU-USD — were up 22.79% and 52.91%, respectively, according to MarketWatch.",Markets|Bitcoin|Gold|Tether|Tether Gold|News,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|FIAT|USDT|XAUT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-12 20:48:52

With geopolitical tensions rising, the European nation is strengthening its ties to China and diversifying its economy. The Swiss government is looking east for stability and diversification as it intensifies trade relations with China due to the record-high tariffs on exports imposed by the U.S. administration. According to a joint statement issued on Friday, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi agreed to speed up the negotiations to upgrade the 2014 free trade agreement between their countries. The announcement came after the fourth round of a strategic dialogue held in Bellinzona, a town in southern Switzerland. Switzerland looks to China as U.S. relations remain strained The free trade agreement with China was the first such deal that China signed with a continental European country. Since then, trade volumes between the two nations have grown substantially, with Switzerland exporting high-tech goods, pharmaceuticals, and luxury products while importing electronics and industrial components. Both governments said that modernizing the decade-old pact will help make bilateral trade “more predictable and sustainable” while promoting a more open and balanced form of globalization. The Swiss economy has quickly felt the impact of the 39% tariffs imposed on exports by the United States in August, which is dependent on its advanced manufacturing and pharmaceutical industries. Trade tensions between Switzerland and the U.S. have already affected the nation’s manufacturing and export sectors. The recent alignment with China comes as the Swiss government fails to make progress in negotiations with Washington over the tariff burden. Swiss Foreign Minister Cassis emphasized that cooperation with China does not come at the expense of relations with Western allies.

CZ has directly addressed suspicions about BNB’s stability as most “blue-chip” altcoins fell significantly while BNB saw a minimal dip of around 2-3% before quickly recovering, outperforming its peers. In response to an X post that called attention to BNB’s “barely affected” performance, CZ wrote : “Fudders even try to make this sound like a bad thing? 😂🤷‍♂️Please post more of this about #BNB . 🙏” BNB is ‘SAFU’ The former Binance CEO has since been reposting tweets reflecting the same sentiment, including one that reminded people that BNB’s price was not affected even when “CZ was in the USA” because he “built a strong infrastructure called Community.” “New chain comers might not understand it, but we do. New comers will experience it. This is why i keep saying BNB & ASTER are SAFU and everything will be just FINE,” the tweet concluded. In response to another bullish tweet about BNB, CZ pointed out that BNB is one of the few projects that does not have a market maker. “I am not aware of any of my affiliated entities buying or selling #BNB in the past days / weeks,” he wrote before listing out BNB’s sound attributes, including its deflationary status. CZ is unbothered by the FUD While other blue-chip altcoins fell significantly during the peak of the liquidation event, with some falling as far as 80% in meme-heavy segments, BNB only fell by about 17% before rebounding. BNB price lost minimal value and quickly bounced back during a weekend that rocked most of the market. Source: Coinmarketcap Notably, BNB’s intraday loss outpaces its modest 7-day decline, signaling strong buying pressure re-emerging at key psychological levels despite the value hemorrhaging out of the markets. Also, CoinMarketCap data shows that BNB’s limited fall puts it alongside Bitcoin as one of the only top-five cryptocurrencies that have recorded minimal daily losses despite market liquidations exceeding $19 billion at the peak of the disaster. This confirms that there is active “flight-to-safety” rotation toward assets showing strength like BTC and BNB even as the market struggles to recover. As one user pointed out, one big reason why BNB has been able to defend its recent gains is its strong community. However, that’s not all. BNB also benefits from multiple demand catalysts, including trading fee discounts and increasing network revenue during heightened volatility, functions that make it an attractive hedge during events like the recent market crash. It is also important to note that CZ has always supported BNB with his massive platform, often encouraging builders and swatting down FUD. Both acts reassure holders and have translated into great strength for the token. Get seen where it counts.

Even though names like Shiba Inu (SHIB) are showing renewed instances of vibrancy, all the excitement today is around fresher names showing better potential gain. However, as bright as the potential for SHIB is within this cycle, the spotlight is quickly shifting over to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , one DeFi gem valued only $0.035 currently. Now in Phase 6 of presale, already sold out by over 65%, MUTM is grabbing whale attention with its dual-lending strategy combining conventional finance with DeFi lending optimization. By the new means to earn yields combined with strong early traction, many are predicting MUTM is going to make small bets big by earning life-changing profit by the price all the way up to $1 by 2026. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Targets $0.00005 Shiba Inu (SHIB) seems set up to anticipate the reversal from the current trending direction after staying immobile for weeks. The token technically catches up near the potential floor support level at $0.0000108, where the buyers have traditionally fractured the price to rescue. If the floorhold stands good for the token, experts believe that the price will skyrocket up to the reversal level around $0.0000176, translating to resistance. The news will pave the way up for the general bullish breakdown, propelling speculations up to the much-awaited $0.00005 mark. However, most mature investors are shifting their focus from projects with deteriorating fundamentals and usability to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a rising DeFi behemoth. Mutuum Finance Dominates in Q4 Mutuum Finance’s presale is currently in Phase 6, having raised so far over $17.25 million and attained 16,860 investors. That is an indication of increasing confidence towards the project’s future and makes Mutuum Finance a very viable ecosystem for investors aiming for sustainable return and long-term profit. The protocol also includes an active Loan-to-Value (LTV) framework and liquidation process that respond automatically to price shock to impose firmness amidst fluctuations. Reserve multipliers ranging from 10% to 35%, varied according to collateral risk profiles, also incorporate an additional level of surety, hence making the platform firmer as well. MUTM also includes a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program whose vulnerability classification is comprised of four levels, namely the critical, the major, the minor, and the low. This is supplemented by the open architecture design of the platform architecture combined with security-by-design, making the DeFi protocol secure, stable, and robust for the users. Mutuum Finance Borrowing & Lending Protocol The platform is soon launching a game-changing lending and borrowing protocol . The protocol’s Version 1 (V1) will be launched on Sepolia Testnet within Q4 2025 with key functionalities including the liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will have day-one support for the borrowing, lending, and collateralization, the users will be able to have an open-ended, scalable, and efficient DeFi experience. With the market gaining pace, the best investment suggestion for investors investing $1,000 is Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM at just $0.035 today is set to skyrocket past $1, far outshining Shiba Inu. Already raising an impressive $17.25M from over 16,860 investors, the dual-lending strategy, active mechanism for LTV, and security-minded design of Mutuum make it sit among the big boys within the DeFi.

From meme coin mania, DeFi, AI, and RWAs, Solana has managed to capture several on-chain revenue streams that Ethereum couldn’t monetize early, a new report suggests. Solana’s Early Growth Curve According to 21Shares, the blockchain generated roughly $2.85 billion in revenue between October 2024 and September 2025, after averaging nearly $240 million per month. Peaks during periods of intense trading activity were found to be more than $600 million, with January 2025 marking the absolute high point at $616 million. This surge was driven largely by meme coin mania, including coins like Trump Coin. Even after the speculative frenzy cooled, Solana’s monthly revenues have remained in the $150 million-$250 million range. Such sustained figures demonstrated that the chain’s success “is not merely a speculative flash in the pan.” A closer look at the revenue composition reveals a highly diversified ecosystem. Trading applications such as Photon and Axiom contributed $1.12 billion, or 39% of the total, by facilitating faster swaps, advanced execution, and high-frequency activity. Beyond trading, Solana’s infrastructure supports a broad spectrum of DeFi, AI, DePin, and tokenized real-world asset applications. Its architecture, capable of thousands of transactions per second at sub-$0.01 costs, has effectively transformed Solana into a 24/7, global “on-chain Nasdaq,” which has helped it rival long-established Web 2 companies like Palantir ($2.8 billion in 2024) and Robinhood ($2.95 billion) in annual revenue. Perspective Check The contrast with Ethereum during its formative years couldn’t be more obvious. Between 2019 and 2020, roughly four to five years after Ethereum’s launch, monthly revenue averaged less than $10 million, which is less than 5% of what Solana now produces on a monthly basis. In peak months, Solana’s revenue has outpaced Ethereum’s early numbers by more than 50x. While Ethereum’s growth was constrained by congestion and modest gas fee revenue in a nascent DeFi ecosystem, Solana has leveraged high throughput and low fees to monetize a broader range of activity much earlier in its lifecycle. Daily active addresses on Solana now consistently hit 1.2-1.5 million, compared to Ethereum’s 400,000-500,000 during its early years. Solana’s revenue growth has not been linear. 21Shares found that just two years ago, between October 2022 and September 2023, total network revenue stood at a mere $13 million, which can be attributed to early skepticism amid outages and market turbulence. The 220x increase over the past 12 months, however, was a shift from experimental blockchain to a commercially viable ecosystem. Soon after, institutional interest followed suit. Currently, over $3 billion in SOL is held on public company balance sheets, and multiple treasury initiatives are underway from firms including Forward Industries, Pantera Capital, and Brera Holdings.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $2.65 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $4.14. Tezos started strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.6347 Market cap $632.56M Trading volume (24-hour) $24.76M Circulating supply 1.06B XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour high $0.6027 24-hour low $0.5609 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 6.89% 50-day SMA $0.7227 14-Day RSI 29.32 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 24 (Extreme Fear) Green days 16/30 (53%) 200-day SMA $0.7064 Tezos price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: Tezos is up 9%, showing early signs of recovery. Immediate resistance lies at $0.67. Short term indicators support momentum building. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart Tezos (XTZ) is trading around $0.6319, up 9.02% after a significant recovery from last week’s deep losses. The daily candle for October 12 shows renewed buying strength, pushing price above the lower Bollinger band at $0.5931. The mid-band resistance at $0.6745 is now the next hurdle for continuation. XTZUSDT 1-day price chart | Source: TradingView The MACD histogram shows fading bearish momentum. OBV has also started turning up slightly, suggesting that buyers are beginning to accumulate again after the recent capitulation move. If Tezos manages a daily close above $0.64–$0.65, continuation toward $0.67–$0.68 becomes likely. However, a rejection from this area could see price retreat back to $0.59, where short-term support now sits. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Tezos is showing gradual upward momentum, currently holding near $0.637. The Alligator lines have begun to realign positively, with the green line curling above the red and closing the gap with the blue base , a sign of an early trend shift. XTZUSDT 4-hour price chart | Source: TradingView The RSI sits around 52, reflecting modest bullish momentum and room for further gains before becoming overbought. Volume remains steady, confirming that buyers are gradually regaining control. The immediate resistance lies at $0.65–$0.67, where the upper Alligator band and prior breakdown zone align. A breakout above this range could propel price toward $0.70. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.6633 SELL SMA 5 $0.6829 SELL SMA 10 $0.7129 SELL SMA 21 $0.6991 SELL SMA 50 $0.7227 SELL SMA 100 $0.7511 SELL SMA 200 $0.7064 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.6978 SELL EMA 5 $0.7115 SELL EMA 10 $0.7359 SELL EMA 21 $0.7666 SELL EMA 50 $0.7677 SELL EMA 100 $0.7367 SELL EMA 200 $0.7435 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos has bounced strongly from oversold conditions, showing early signs of stabilization. The key test now sits at $0.67, and a break above this level would confirm a short-term bullish reversal. Until that happens, upside potential remains limited, and traders should watch the $0.60 support zone to gauge the strength of the recovery. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs, so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coingecko Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin recovered in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite its partnership milestones, Tezos (XTZ) had a bearish 2024. The coin peaked at $1.4 in April but dropped about 60% by August. Buyers returned in September, driving the price to $0.7015, and momentum carried into November with a peak of $1.856. The rally extended to December, when XTZ reached $1.909 before corrections brought the year-end close to $1.286. XTZ peaked at $1.49 in January 2025 before dropping to an average of $0.72 in February. From March to May, it consolidated below $0.70 with an overall average of $0.66. In June, it traded between $0.4752 and $0.6362, while July averaged $0.7232. August opened at $0.7605 and averaged $0.8212.

According to release notes shared by Bitcoin Core, the update brings performance improvements and bug fixes. However, many devs and Bitcoin supporters are opposing an update to OP_RETURN, which lets users attach data of up to 100,000 bytes (100KB) instead of the previous 83 byte limit. What are the major changes in Bitcoin Core v30.0? One of the major updates in Bitcoin Core is lower default fees. Nodes can relay transactions between peers with fees as low as 0.1 sat/vB. Miners, on the other hand, will be able to include transactions in the next block with a minimum fee of 0.001 sat/vB. OP_RETURN, which lets Bitcoin users attach data, like special messages, has more room to attach data, from 83 bytes to 100KB. OP_RETURN has multiple outputs instead of the previous single output. The increase in data limit lets users attach hashes, certificates, or even art metadata. Moreover, Bitcoin Core v30.0 no longer supports BDB wallets. Users must migrate to descriptor wallets, which are safer and easier to back up. Wallet commands such as importwallet and dumpwallet are also gone . The update also brings TRUC transactions, which avoid transaction conflicts while they wait for confirmation. Another new command is bitcoin, which simplifies how node operators and miners interact with Bitcoin Core. Also , typing bitcoin node, bitcoin gui, or bitcoin rpc replaces multiple older commands. Miners can connect directly to Bitcoin Core with an experimental PC Mining Interface, which works through local sockets, making block template requests faster . The graphical user interface (GUI) received multiple updates as well . The graphical toolkit was updated from Qt5 to Qt6 . Dark mode for Windows users is now supported, and on macOS, the Metal graphics are available for smoother performance. Other updates include fixing five low-severity bugs. The full details of bug fixes will be released within two weeks. Any node operating Bitcoin Core v27.x will no longer receive newer updates since v27.x is now labeled “End of Life” according to release notes from Bitcoin Core. What’s the controversy about Core v30.0? The increase of OP_RETURN’s data limit from 83 bytes to 100,000 bytes (100KB) received heavy criticism from developers and Bitcoin supporters. As mentioned above, OP_RETURN now lets users attach more data and allows multiple OP_RETURN outputs in one transaction. The Bitcoin Knots community, led by developer Luke Dashjr and Bitcoin Mechanic, opposed the new changes to OP_RETURN. They argued that increasing the data limit could force node operators to host illegal or harmful content, such as explicit material or malicious code. This could pose legal issues for node operators. The Knots community believes that Bitcoin should focus on money transfer, not file storage. In contrast, Bitcoin Core developers say the changes only adjust the memory pool (mempool) policy. It will not affect Bitcoin’s consensus rules. In September, Bitcoin Core developers planned to deprecate user control over the OP_RETURN data limit. That would have forced node operators to accept higher data limits without the option to reduce them. After backlash, Core maintainer Ava Chow restored user configurability over the data limits just before the October release window. The decision temporarily ended fears of forced settings. But the feature could be implemented in future versions. The update also changed how the -datacarriersize setting works. In older versions, a number like 83 represented an 83-byte limit, but in v30 the same value allows 9x more data. Critics say this silent change misleads users. For now, v30 keeps the new 100 KB default while still letting users manually lower it. Is Bitcoin going to fork? In late September, leaked messages suggested that Luke Dashjr might consider a temporary hard fork of Bitcoin to resist the new OP_RETURN data limit changes. TheRage claimed Dashjr was exploring a fork to protect node operators from potentially illegal data spreading through the network. But Dashjr denied the claims, calling the reports “fake news.” He said he was not planning any fork and that “there is no hard fork.” Still, he maintained his opposition to the new rules and accused “Core30 apologists” of being the only ones proposing forks. TheRage publication stood by its reporting, pointing out that neither Dashjr nor his colleagues disputed the authenticity of the leaked messages.

His remarks came after Ethena Labs’ synthetic dollar, USDe , briefly depegged amid the most severe liquidation cascade in the digital asset market’s history, which was triggered by President Donald Trump’s announcement of new tariffs on Chinese imports on October 10. In a post on X , Ardoino declared that “USDT is the best collateral for derivatives and margin trading. Liquid, tested by fire.” He added, in characteristic flair, that those using “low liquidity tokens, some bananas, a horse, 3 olives and a chewed bubblegum” as collateral should “brace yourself when the market moves.” USDe’s flash depeg exposes structural fragility Ethena Labs’ USDe, a $14 billion “synthetic” stablecoin ranked third by market capitalization, was among the hardest hit in the midst of the crisis. USDe maintains its dollar peg through a derivatives-based hedging structure that combines spot crypto holdings with offsetting short futures positions, which is very different from Tether’s USDT or Circle’s USDC, both fiat-backed by cash and Treasury reserves. Comparison of USDe’s dollar peg on Curve and Binance. Source: Guy Young ( @gdog97_ ) on X During the turmoil, USDe’s price on Binance plunged as low as $0.65 following what Ethena described as an internal pricing discrepancy in the exchange’s spot market. On-chain liquidity pools such as Curve, Fluid, and Uniswap, by contrast, showed only minor deviations, which weren’t up to 30 basis points, similar to spreads between USDC and USDT. Binance’s degraded performance exacerbated the dislocation. It affected BNSOL, the Binance-issued Solana liquid staking token, and WBETH, the wrapped Beacon liquid staking token. According to Guy Young , Ethena Labs founder, Ethena’s mint and redeem function processed “more than $1b in a few hours and $2b in a 24-hour period with zero issues.” Young post on X implied that the depeg was a Binance-specific glitch rather than a structural failure of USDe itself. He proposed improved oracle designs to prevent forced liquidations during short-lived price distortions and suggested that pegging to USDT rather than USD during periods of stress could have mitigated the incident. Binance’s chief executive officer, Richard Teng, later apologized for the performance of the platform and its impact on users during the heat of Friday’s market capitulation and promised to compensate affected users, acknowledging that “there are no excuses” for its performance during the event. Tether touts durability as rivals stumble For Ardoino, the incident provided an opportunity to contrast USDT with other players in the market. USDT, now with more than $179 billion in circulation, weathered the rout without deviation, a fact Ardoino was quick to highlight. His post fits within an effort to position Tether as crypto’s foundational layer of liquidity and reliability, following years of scrutiny over its reserves and transparency. Ardoino has made a point of emphasizing Tether’s conservative asset management and swift redemption record, describing the token as battle-tested. His comment on the other low-liquidity tokens is quite sardonic; however, the market appears to have validated his claim. After the crash: lessons in collateral and design The October 10 event has already entered crypto lore as the “Tariff Crash,” both for its geopolitical trigger and for the staggering $19 billion in forced liquidations it produced, the largest in digital asset history. Analysts say the sell-off exposed how heavily the market still depends on leverage and centralized pricing feeds. Ethena’s measured handling of redemptions earned it cautious praise from some investors, but the episode highlighted how even sophisticated hedging systems remain vulnerable to exchange-specific distortions. Calls are growing for decentralized oracles that derive prices from deep-liquidity pools rather than individual venues and for real-time proof-of-collateral monitoring to identify early signs of stress.

The Russian media outlet RBC reported that domestic industry insiders say the blockchain-powered solution would be “feasible and attractive to foreign investors.” Vladimir Chistyukhin, the First Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, spoke about the matter on the sidelines of a recent financial forum. When asked about the tokenization of Russian shares, the Central Bank executive responded with a positive response, calling it a “possible option.” Vladimir Chistyukhin, the First Deputy Chairman of Russia’s Central Bank. (Source: MGIMO/YouTube/Screenshot) Russia’s Central Bank: Tokenization Could Help Firms Evade Sanctions However, Chistyukhin suggested that overseas players would need to provide technical and platform-based solutions. He said: “In this area, foreign partners will be playing a significant role. I am talking about the foreign entities who are willing to tokenize Russian assets in order to buy and sell them abroad.” Chistyukhin’s comments come hot on the heels of a proposal from Sergei Shvetsov, the head of the Moscow Exchange’s Supervisory Board. In late September this year, Shvetsov said that overseas investors want to buy Russian shares. And he said that tokenization would help them do so, as the solution does not make use of “sanctioned infrastructure.” Shvetsov went on to explain that decision-makers in Moscow have been openly talking about the tokenization of Russian shares. The exchange appears to believe that traditional finance-powered solutions tend to make use of “sanctioned infrastructure and sanctioned intermediaries and brokers.” These, he said, were “unfortunately common in Russia today.” Tokenization, he added, was one of several possible workarounds under consideration. Russian Experts Back Plans RBC quoted an official from the Russian banking group Sovcombank as voicing support for the plan. The Sovcombank official said that tokenization “could become a suitable tool for investors” from investors in BRICS countries or “friendly jurisdictions like the UAE, Kazakhstan, or Armenia.” Sovcombank offices in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Gennady Grachev [CC BY 2.0]) In the long term, the official added, tokenization could “accelerate the Russian market’s integration into the global digital financial system.” Alexey Korolenko, the Executive Director of Cifra Markets, concurred. He said that tokenization would allow traders with limited capital to buy fractions of stocks with a high market value per share. Korolenko added that the real-world assets (RWAs) sector is now going “mainstream,” and is now “in high demand among investors.” He concluded that the idea of tokenizing Russian shares was “entirely feasible.” But Korolenko warned that Moscow must ensure that providers meet reliability requirements “for the entire ownership and tokenization chain.” Experts also said regulators would need to consider infrastructure and liquidity matters, as well as possible “political risks.” The post Russia’s Central Bank: Tokenization Will Let Foreigners Buy Domestic Shares appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Russia|Tokenization,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|FIAT|BUSINESS|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-12 23:30:00

The AI startup is taking on rivals like Meta and Google in developing next-generation AI that goes beyond text-based tools like ChatGPT or Grok. These models use data from videos and robots to learn how the real world behaves and could reshape how AI interacts with reality. Two people familiar with xAI’s work reportedly said the company plans to use these world models in gaming, building fully interactive 3D environments that respond like real spaces. Also, the same systems could later power AI robots, training them to move and react naturally. The company’s latest hires from Nvidia bring deep expertise in this area, making xAI a direct competitor in one of the most advanced AI fields yet. xAI strengthens team with Nvidia researchers to expand gaming and robotics goals xAI recruited Zeeshan Patel and Ethan He, two Nvidia researchers with experience developing simulation-based AI. Nvidia has long led the charge with its Omniverse platform, which allows developers to create detailed, physics-based simulations. Some technology companies believe world models could eventually transform AI into something that functions across both digital and physical products, including humanoid robots. Nvidia recently told the Financial Times that the potential global market for world models could reach the size of the entire world economy. That’s the scale of ambition now driving this technology. Elon said on X that xAI plans to launch an AI-generated game before the end of next year, confirming a goal he first mentioned in 2024. The announcement sets a clear timeline for xAI’s gaming ambitions, tying together Musk’s push to merge simulation, creativity, and real-world interaction. This week, xAI released a new image and video generation model with what it called “massive upgrades,” available for free. The company said the model creates sharper videos with more natural motion. Unlike current systems like OpenAI’s Sora, which predicts frames from learned image data, world models are built to understand cause and effect – how gravity, objects, and space work in real time. This allows them to generate realistic movement and physics instead of just visuals. xAI launches hiring spree and doubles down on real-world AI training To expand its work, xAI is hiring technical staff for its “omni team,” which focuses on image, video, and audio generation. Job listings describe it as building AI experiences beyond text, including multimedia creation. The positions pay between $180,000 and $440,000 per year, depending on seniority. There’s also a job posting for a “video games tutor,” who will train Grok to produce and design video games. That role pays $45 to $100 per hour, aimed at helping users explore AI-assisted game creation. Elon joins Meta and Google in pushing toward world models, but the challenge remains steep. Training AI to replicate the real world requires massive datasets (footage, physics data, and 3D mapping) all of which are costly to gather and process. Even with access to Nvidia hardware and talent, xAI faces technical and financial hurdles to scale these systems effectively. Not everyone in the gaming world is convinced. Michael Douse, publishing head at Larian Studios, the developer behind Baldur’s Gate 3 , wrote on X that AI won’t solve the game industry’s “big problem,” which he said is about “leadership and vision.” He added that the sector doesn’t need “more mathematically produced, psychologically trained gameplay loops,” but rather “expressions of worlds that people are actually engaged with or want to engage with.” Get $50 free to trade crypto when you sign up to Bybit now",Tech|Elon Musk|xAI,EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-12 23:40:06
53059784,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=834486,1760313538,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53059784.jpeg,Binance shells out $283 after token depegs rock market,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/binance-shells-out-283-after-token-depegs/,"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, announced that it has reimbursed customers for a total of $283 million after a volatile Friday, during which several tokens on the exchange depegged or experienced unnatural price crashes. The compensatory measure was taken in the midst of the worst-ever single-day liquidation, which erased around $20 billion worth of leveraged exposure and sent shivers throughout the digital asset space. According to Binance customers, many altcoins dropped to $0 on Friday’s pullback, a trend observed across the entire trading platform. This event, which included IoTeX (IOTX), Cosmos (ATOM), and Enjin, caused widespread panic. However, Binance has ascertained that this was just a display glitch. In a Sunday statement, Binance explained that the incident was caused by a “display issue” in its trading interface. According to the exchange, recent updates to the trading pairs, such as IOTX/USDT, had reduced the number of decimal places allowed for minimum price movements. This change caused the platform’s system to display a $0 price when token values were too small to render correctly. “Certain trading pairs, such as IOTX/USDT, recently reduced the number of decimal places allowed for minimum price movement, causing the displayed prices in the user interface to be zero, which is a display issue and not due to an actual $0 price.” The explanation helped calm fears after screenshots of zero-value tokens flooded social media, adding to the panic during an already chaotic market downturn. Depegged tokens trigger Binance’s compensation effort Adding to the turbulence, three Binance Earn assets —Ethena’s synthetic dollar (USDe), Binance Solana liquid staking token (BNSOL), and Wrapped Beacon ETH (WBETH)—temporarily depegged from their intended prices. Ethena’s USDe, meant to maintain a 1:1 peg with the U.S. dollar, briefly dropped to $0.66 on Binance. The exchange said it has fully compensated users who were affected between 21:36 and 22:16 UTC on October 10. This includes traders using USDe, BNSOL, or WBETH as collateral in futures, margin, and loan markets, as well as users who suffered verified losses through Earn redemptions or internal transfers. Ethena Labs CEO Guy Young pushed back against claims that USDe had officially depegged, noting that the incident was confined to Binance. “It is not accurate to describe this as a USDe depeg when a single venue was out of line with the deepest pools of liquidity that experienced no abnormal price deviations whatsoever,” Young wrote on X. Speculation mounts over possible exploit as Binance denies external attack Amid the confusion, some market observers speculated that a coordinated exploit had targeted Binance. A trader known as ElonTrades suggested that attackers may have exploited Binance’s Unified Account feature, which utilizes internal order-book data rather than external oracle feeds. This design difference, according to the theory, created a vulnerability that could be manipulated to produce sudden price discrepancies. ElonTrades claimed the exploit triggered a cascade of liquidations on Binance, eventually spilling over to the broader market. However, Binance denied any evidence of an external attack, stating that “the extreme market downturn occurred before the depegging.” To address future risks, Binance said it would update its reference index by including asset redemption prices and introducing a soft price floor for USDe. These measures are designed to stabilize future trading activity during extreme volatility. Renewed scrutiny spurs calls for stricter oversight of centralized exchanges The chaos has renewed calls for greater transparency and oversight in centralized exchanges. Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek publicly urged regulators to investigate the cause of the extreme price swings, arguing that such events undermine confidence in centralized trading platforms. Marszalek said centralized exchanges must ensure that retail investors are protected from technical and structural failures, emphasizing the need for consistent regulatory standards. Despite the turbulence, crypto markets staged a notable recovery over the weekend. BNB, Binance’s native token, rallied more than 11% in 24 hours, while The Block’s GM30 Index, which tracks the top 30 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, rose 6.8%. In a statement, Binance emphasized that it is still “reviewing and handling user cases” related to the depegging and liquidation events. The exchange also pledged to reinforce infrastructure resiliency, work on transparency, and continue to provide customers with confidence following one of the most turbulent events in recent crypto history. Having already paid out damages of $283 million to impacted clients, Binance is attempting to demonstrate that it can respond quickly in the wake of a crisis and provide reassurance to customers while proving its resilience amid fast-paced market changes.

With a price of $0.00014574, over 31 billion tokens already sold, 2,800+ holders, and $860K+ raised, it’s more than just hype; it’s traction. At the heart of its momentum is the staggering ROI potential. Based on its listing target of $0.00527141, early buyers stand to gain over 3500% if projections hold. This isn’t a pipe dream. The economics are clear, and the math adds up. What makes BullZilla ($BZIL) crypto presale stand out is its stage-based growth model. Stage 6B, currently live, locks in investors at an ideal entry. With every presale phase, token scarcity increases, which historically drives prices higher on launch. Beyond the tokenomics, BullZilla’s branding is designed to resonate with meme coin lovers but grounded enough to appeal to analysts and devs. The green candles? They’re only part of the story. It’s also backed by liquidity plans, audited contracts, and a roadmap loaded with DeFi integrations. If there’s a top crypto to join now that could break out meme-style while offering institutional-grade structure, this is it. 2. Chainlink (LINK): The Backbone of Smart Contract Infrastructure Chainlink has moved from a niche oracle provider to a pillar of Web3 infrastructure. As smart contracts evolve, they need reliable data feeds — and that’s where LINK thrives. Chainlink’s value lies in its real-world adoption. It’s being integrated into DeFi, insurance, gaming, and even TradFi sectors. With the recent launch of Chainlink CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol), it’s poised to be the bridge between blockchains and traditional financial systems. While not a presale, LINK offers stability and long-term upside. Analysts from Messari and IntoTheBlock have consistently rated LINK as undervalued based on on-chain metrics and network activity. Though it may not offer 3500% upside like BZIL, LINK provides a lower-risk entry into infrastructure investing. For students and financial analysts looking for tech-backed plays, Chainlink remains a strong bet. 3. MoonBull (MOBU): The Staking Revolution That Rewards Conviction MoonBull is turning heads by merging meme coin enthusiasm with DeFi mechanics that reward holding. Its 23-stage scarcity model creates deflationary pressure, while its Ethereum foundation ensures security. But where MoonBull truly innovates is in its staking rewards — up to 95% APY through its AI-based optimizer. This tool adjusts rewards in real-time based on market volatility, giving holders consistent earnings without active management. The presale structure supports value growth, reinforced by instant referral bonuses and permanently locked liquidity. As the best upcoming crypto to join in 2025, MoonBull is building something deeper than memes. It’s a hybrid, part entertainment, part yield-generating machine. For devs and analysts, the real hook is its verified smart contract and upcoming cross-chain staking. This project doesn’t just want hype: it wants utility, governance, and global adoption. 4. La Culex (CULEX): The Meme Coin Built on Smart Tokenomics La Culex (CULEX) is an upcoming meme coin project. With a max supply of 200B and 45% allocated to presale, its tokenomics are built for sustained value appreciation. Its presale structure splits tokens across 32 phases. Each completed stage makes the token rarer, pushing its price closer to a $0.007 listing target. That’s an exponential opportunity for early buyers. Add to that an 80% APY via the Hive Vault, and a 12% referral bonus through the Bite Chain, and La Culex becomes a community-driven ecosystem with real rewards. With no transaction tax, locked liquidity, and audited contracts, it’s ticking all the boxes for safety. For anyone asking which top crypto to join now, La Culex offers a unique upcoming meme token with built-in longevity and growth. 5. Ethereum (ETH): The King That Keeps Evolving No serious list is complete without Ethereum. It’s the Layer-1 backbone of DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and more. But what keeps ETH attractive in 2025 is its shift to proof-of-stake, which drastically reduced its energy usage and circulating supply. ETH staking is now mainstream, and the introduction of L2s like Optimism and Arbitrum is solving the scalability problem of ETH. According to Glassnode, ETH’s staking deposits are at an all-time high, showing confidence in its long-term potential. ETH may not 50x from here, but it’s the reserve asset of Web3. For analysts and developers, ETH offers both innovation and stability. It’s a slow burner, not a moonshot, but one with fundamental strength. Conclusion: The Window of Opportunity Is Narrowing For those wondering which top crypto to join now, the answer is increasingly evident. BullZilla ($BZIL) isn’t just gaining traction, it’s racing ahead. With over $860K raised, a presale structure that rewards early adopters, and a projected 3500% ROI, it offers a rare combination of meme coin energy and solid fundamentals. Yet, it’s not alone. MoonBull and La Culex are pushing boundaries with staking innovations and community-first tokenomics. Chainlink and Ethereum, while more established, continue to be pillars of long-term growth. Whether you’re chasing the next breakout or building a diversified portfolio, these five projects represent the sharpest edges of the crypto frontier. The timing? Now. Because in a space that moves this fast, waiting often costs more than acting early.

53060482,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=834490,1760314765,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53060482.jpeg,Singapore to keep policy steady as inflation cools,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/singapore-to-keep-policy-steady/,"Singapore’s central bank is likely to hold monetary policy steady this week, citing low inflation and ongoing US trade uncertainties, while domestic growth remains stable. A recent survey revealed that 16 out of 20 economists anticipate the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will maintain its current policy settings. On the other hand, four economists, including some from DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and TD Securities, speculate that the bank might begin easing its policy again after maintaining it unchanged during its final review in July. Central banks adopt different strategies to support their country’s economic growth The MAS carefully reviews its policy four times annually. In January and April, the agency loosened its policy setting to support the country’s uncertain economic status, as it encountered slowdowns and risks that required cautious navigation. Unlike most central banks , which prefer adjusting interest rates in the event of growing uncertainties, Singapore’s central bank’s main aim is to stabilize prices by controlling the rise of its dollar based on trade. This act follows the central banks’ new decision to adopt different operational strategies. To support this claim, reliable sources report that Indonesia and New Zealand are further reducing their interest rates to enhance the countries’ economic growth. At the same time, Thailand, Malaysia, and Australia keep their rates steady as they thoroughly examine the impacts of previous changes. The US Federal Reserve, on the other hand, had earlier lowered borrowing costs for the first time since December last year. Concerning the situation, Lloyd Chan, a Senior Currency Analyst at MUFG’s Global Markets Research in Singapore, commented that the central bank appears to be holding off on any additional action until it identifies any signs of economic decline. Escalating trade tensions between the US and China also shape Singapore’s policy outlook. The US-China trade conflict has escalated as Beijing retaliates to US tariff policies with restrictions on the exports of rare-earth minerals. Regarding the US’s tariff policies, US President Donald Trump made public his intentions to impose additional tariffs and set up limitations on software sales to China. With this escalation, companies are getting ready for any potential interruption. China’s commerce ministry blamed Washington for raising trade tensions between the two countries after Trump announced on Friday that he would impose additional tariffs on China’s exports to the US, along with new controls on critical software, by November 1 . “Wilful threats of high tariffs are not the right way to get along with China,” a spokesperson for the commerce ministry said on Sunday, according to the state news agency Xinhua. “China’s position on the trade war is consistent. We do not want it, but we are not afraid of it. According to the spokesperson, while China does not seek a trade war, it will defend its interests if the US continues down this path. US stock index increased, signaling a breather after the worst dip since April, as Trump’s administration signaled openness to a trade deal following tensions between Washington and Beijing that shot up last week. Contracts on the S&P 500 advanced 0.9% as of 7:01 p.m. in New York, while Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.2%. After trade tensions between the world’s two leading economies began on Friday and over the weekend, US Vice President JD Vance told Beijing to “choose the path of reason,” threatening that Trump has more leverage if the fight does not come to an end. Singapore’s economy demonstrates signs of recovery, boosting the Singapore dollar Despite growing tension in the market, analysts have highlighted some bright spots in Singapore’s economy. To illustrate this, consumer spending grew more than expected in August and manufacturing activity increased to 56.4 last month, marking its eighth month of significant growth. Aditionally, private home prices posted their largest gain in three quarters, led by a jump in sales of new apartments. This rise and growing interest in safe regional investments have boosted the Singapore dollar. While it has gained more than 5% against the US dollar this year, it has remained relatively stable since MAS’s last decision at the end of July. However, Singapore’s core inflation continued to decline in August for the second month in a row. Concerning this, officials upheld the belief that price increases of imported goods will remain moderate soon. Afterwards, they forecasted that the core inflation will average between 0.5% and 1.5% this year.

New findings from Alvarez & Marsal show that the Trump administration’s deregulation drive will open up nearly $2.6 trillion in new lending power for U.S. banks. The rollback of post-crisis capital rules, those designed after the Great Recession in 2008, is expected to free $140 billion in locked capital for America’s biggest lenders, setting off pressure on regulators in Europe and Asia to reconsider their own limits. Since Donald Trump returned to the White House nine months ago, U.S. regulators have eased constraints that once forced banks to maintain large loss-absorbing buffers. The updated rules will strengthen the position of many Wall Street giants, allowing them to channel more money into AI, data centers, and energy infrastructure while also boosting shareholder payouts. The policy reversal will benefit the largest financial institutions far more than regional banks struggling with credit costs and liquidity tightening. Trump’s deregulation drive unlocks massive lending firepower Fernando de la Mora, co-head of financial services at Alvarez & Marsal, said Trump is “kicking off a major wave of deregulation, unlocking a huge amount of capacity, which will give a massive economic boost and an earnings uplift.” The consultancy’s data shows a 14% cut in common equity tier one capital requirements for American banks, a rule that dictates how much equity must be held against losses. That reduction alone could lift earnings per share by 35% and returns on tangible common equity by 6%, helping banks scale credit and push deeper into high-yield markets like crypto and AI financing. The full report details how similar deregulation might ripple through other markets, as the U.K. is expected to trim bank capital requirements by 8%, likely to preserve competitiveness with the U.S. But EU regulators are taking a different path, preparing to raise requirements by 1%, while Switzerland is set for an even bigger jump of up to 33%. The Swiss proposal could force UBS to raise $26 billion in fresh capital after rescuing Credit Suisse, a move aimed at preventing another financial shock. “This is going to drive a further market share gain by U.S. banks,” de la Mora added, saying U.K. banks would maintain ground while Swiss and EU lenders lose momentum. With looser restrictions and billions in freed-up funds, Wall Street is positioned to outpace global rivals as the balance tilts back toward U.S. dominance. Federal Reserve and regulators back easing despite global concern JPMorgan Chase will likely see the biggest payoff, with an estimated $39 billion in capital released from its balance sheet. That will raise its earnings per share by 31% and its return on equity by 7%, giving it extra flexibility to lend and invest. Within Washington, Michelle Bowman, newly appointed vice-chair of supervision at the Federal Reserve, has been one of the loudest voices for loosening capital rules. She has criticized the strict standards of the past decade, arguing they “pushed lending into private credit markets” and reduced traditional banking activity. Regulators have already outlined plans to relax requirements for banks to hold fixed levels of high-quality capital relative to total assets. They also intend to change the extra capital buffers for the biggest banks and redesign the annual stress tests that limit risk-taking. Huw van Steenis, vice-chair of Oliver Wyman, said, “There is a capital investment boom in the U.S. to be financed — for AI, data centers, energy infrastructure and some reshoring. This recalibration of regulation will help banks lean into this financing wave.” His comment reflects the private sector’s anticipation of a massive credit expansion as the rules ease. But not everyone is on board. Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank, warned against a “regulatory rollback” that could endanger financial stability. Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, added that regulators must avoid “the baby being thrown out with the bathwater” as they adjust oversight. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

However, while Solana’s momentum shines so bright, investors are questioning how high the rally will be able to reach, specifically as new projects are already promising much larger potential upsurges. None is better compared to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , the DeFi rising-star project presale currently under Phase 6, valued only at $0.035. The DeFi dual-lending protocol platform presented by Mutuum Finance gives users the capability to gain yields under a safer, streamlined ecosystem. With an estimated $1 potential growth by 2026 by the experts, early investors believe MUTM is the next-gen DeFi token capable of rivaling, if not surging past, Solana’s early growth curve. Solana Eyes the Next Move Up to $300 Solana (SOL) seems to be riding on past glory having finished a five-wave upswing from the September lows opting instead for the onset of healthy corrective correction. Presently commentators are speculating on two probable outcomes, namely SOL runs into the $214–$208 buying area only to reel off later toward the subsequent rally leg, or ends early and takes off straight into the subsequent rally leg. In either case, market configuration is bullish for continued movement to the bullish side, with analysts speculating on a breakout that will ultimately take SOL up to the $300 level sometime in the next few weeks. But for investors aiming for diversification into promising projects, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), one emerging DeFi performer is making strong strides. Mutuum Finance Presale Hype Gains Steam Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining investor attention this week following tremendous speed in Phase 6 of presale. The tokens are currently valued at $0.035, up by a 16.17% increment from the previous round. Over 16,860 investors have already purchased generating over $17.25 million, healthfully depicting an emerging market confidence in the bright DeFi future of Mutuum Finance. With over 60% sold in Phase 6, early investors are acquiring their buy-ins before the next increment. A second cushion is offered by the shape of the reserve multiplier configuration, itself apportioned from 10% for small risk projects to 35% for high risk projects. The configuration underpins system resilience, dampens liquidation shocks, and insulates capital integrity. Even the collateral management is optimized, for eventual ultimate power-to-borrow by mutual complementing leveraging off the related holdings, with the ultimate bankruptcy risk elimination and overall platform health. Real-Time Data Through Chainlink Oracles For precise, stable pricing alongside risk calculation, Mutuum Finance is making use of Chainlink oracles for USD, ETH, MATIC, and AVAX feeds. Fallback oracles, advanced data feeds, and decentralized exchange TWAPs guarantee the valuation from the protocol remains precise even during record-record volatility or illiquid conditions. Mutuum’s lending and borrowing protocol is soon expected to go live. Version 1 (V1) is slated to come out on Sepolia Testnet during Q4 2025 and will have key components such as liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be provided at the launch for collaterals, lending, and borrowing and will give the users the efficient, scalable, and secure DeFi. The platform also provides floating-, fixed-, and floating/fixed-degree tools and balances the supply versus the demand for the liquids as well as stabilizes the ecosystem. Whereas Solana (SOL) is plotting a bullish continuation chart to $300, investors are setting their sights on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for even larger potential. At only $0.035 during Phase 6 of presale, more than 65% of the tokens have been sold so far, generating $17.25 million from more than 16,860 investors. By means of the dual-lending protocol on the Chain, oracle inclusion by Chainlink, and the reserve multiplier mechanism, the platform is providing tangible DeFi utility with great risk coverage. Analysts believe MUTM will reach $1 by 2026, including the token on their radar as the ultimate early-stage bet for the next crypto upcycle. Get on the Mutuum Finance presale today before Phase 6 closes.

In a statement dated October 13, the think tank noted that this reform is important because it will enable Reeves to collect more funds while minimizing the negative economic effects. Concerning the IFS’s advice to the chancellor, officials in the London-based research institute told Reeves not to increase the current tax rate to collect the extra funds she needs, which is approximately 30 billion pounds, equivalent to around $40 billion, to satisfy her goals for enhancing public finances. “What we really do not want in November is the encouragement of aimless changes and half-hearted solutions,” said Isaac Delestre, a senior research economist at the IFS. Delestre views November’s budget as a chance for real progress. Therefore, he urges the chancellor to use this budget to establish a more sensible tax system. Delestre urges Reeves to establish a more logical tax system Earlier, Reeves and Keir Starmer, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, assured voters that they would not increase social security contributions, value-added tax , or income tax on employees. Additionally, they pledged not to raise the main tax on corporate profits. Last year, the UK chancellor increased social security costs for employers. However, after increasing these expenses, Reeves still has options to consider for the upcoming budget on November 26. This includes taxes on wealth and property. Regarding these considerations, the IFS pointed out that changing wealth-related taxes, such as capital gains tax, would be more impactful than adopting a new annual wealth tax. The think tank officials highlighted that they were aware some members of the ruling Labour Party opt for a new annual wealth tax. On the other hand, the IFS urged transferring local property tax responsibilities to regions like London for property-related taxes. According to the think tank, these regions have recently experienced increased house prices, and the relevant authorities have removed the stamp duty tax on property purchases. The leader of Britain’s opposition Conservative Party expressed their great support for eliminating the stamp tax last week. Apart from the IFS, another significant think tank, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, commented on the topic of discussion. According to them, Reeves should focus on crucial matters, such as reassessing her earlier pledge not to increase employee taxes, rather than less important issues like finding effective methods to boost revenue. Think tank officials call on Reeves to stick to her earlier commitment Think tank officials call on Reeves to reconsider her earlier pledge not to raise taxes on working people because they believe this approach would be preferable to looking for other methods of raising revenue that could cause significant damage to the county’s economy. Following this, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research stated that alternative ways to raise the £30 billion, equivalent to approximately $40 billion, that Reeves will need are too disruptive to the economy. Meanwhile, in the UK, the government’s borrowing costs have risen more than expected. Moreover, a plan to save 5 billion pounds a year on welfare spending has been abandoned, and the country’s budget watchdog suggested that it might cut its growth forecasts. Still, Starmer and Reeves have repeatedly said for months that they are determined to honour their pre-election commitments, including at last month’s annual Labour Party conference. “A new wealth tax,” the NIESR added, citing a policy that some Labour lawmakers support, “is likely to reduce savings, increasing the cost of borrowing and discouraging investment.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",News|UK,EN,0,0,REGULATION|RESEARCH|BUSINESS|CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-13 01:44:55

Fully enacted in late 2024, MiCA set a harmonized regime for crypto asset providers across the 27-member bloc for the first time. No company was explicitly cited in the EBA statement. Still, it warned that attempts to circumvent these regulations could persist and carry substantial risks for the functioning of the EU’s financial system. EBA addresses several risks, including “forum shopping.” This refers to firms attempting to obtain regulatory approval in one country that they perceive as having less stringent approval mechanisms, so they can subsequently operate legally in other parts of the EU. This is also known as “ passporting .” According to the EBA report, before the adoption of MiCA , one unnamed entity submitted applications for registration and licensing in several states within a short timeframe. It further continued to withdraw from jurisdictions where authorities continuously probed or its application was challenged, before proceeding to operate in countries where it went unchallenged. EBA noted, “In practice, entities with weak AML/CFT controls have already entered and are operating in the EU market by selecting jurisdictions with lighter supervisory practices or previously lower market entry requirements.” MiCA transition period may allow unlicensed firms to continue operations While MiCA came fully into effect last year, it included a transition window that runs until July 1, 2026, giving firms some time to either get a license or be deemed non-compliant. According to the regulator, “emerging evidence suggests that there may be a risk that entities which were previously licensed in a Member State and have not met the authorisation conditions under MiCA but are appealing their case may continue to operate in the EU in the interim time.” Dr. Hendrik Müller-Lankow, a lawyer at the German crypto law firm Kronsteyn , states that, based on his experience, supervisory arbitrage and supervisory shopping are in fact occurring throughout the EU. He adds that this is a phenomenon regulators must accept if they want to establish a single market while still maintaining some level of supervisory authority. “It is well known that people—and thus also authorities—in different Member States have different mentalities when applying laws,” he added. Müller-Lankow believes the EU could tackle the issue by centralizing both its legislation and supervisory authorities. He noted much of this is already underway, and EU authorities are actively working to expand their powers. Lankow also highlighted that some crypto firms may be establishing themselves in the EU without transparent governance or clear beneficial ownership, making it difficult to determine accountability. Opaque structures in crypto firms heighten risk of illicit activity According to the EBA report, a virtual asset service provider, or VASP, that applied for an operating license in several EU jurisdictions was found by one crypto authority to “be jointly run by more than 20 distinct entities that were largely established outside the EU and outside regulatory oversight.” The EBA warns that such opaque structures may enable the misuse of front or shell companies. The independent EU agency added that entities that lack real economic activity can serve as drivers to channel illicit funds under the guise of legitimate transactions.” The EBA’s report highlights the continued difficulty faced by the EU in enforcing a common crypto regulatory framework. Although MiCA aims to provide the market with clarity and stability, areas of uncertainty and opaque corporate structures may persist. Regulators are facing increased pressure to intensify the regulation of crypto assets and enhance cooperation between member states, aiming to prevent digital tokens from being used for nefarious purposes, protect investors, and maintain the integrity of the EU financial system. With the transition phase extending into mid-2026, however, the next few months will be crucial in shaping MiCA’s potential to deliver on its promise of a fully harmonized and secure crypto market.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin is trading at $115,157, steady after a volatile weekend which began with the largest crypto liquidation event in history , while Ether rose to $4,146, extending its recovery from Friday’s lows near $3,700. Elsewhere, Solana gained 11% to $196, Bittensor surged 28%, and Cronos jumped 11%, according to CoinDesk market data, as capital rotated back into high-beta assets following a $20 billion leverage flush. Both Washington and Beijing worked to cool down trade tensions over the weekend , helping the recovery. Bitwise’s Jonathan Man points to positioning as the key factor: leverage was stretched across long-tail tokens, so when liquidity vanished, the wipeout was severe — but it cleared the decks for a faster reset. Staking also played a secondary role in cushioning the decline. With nearly 30% of ETH supply locked in validators but only a quarter of that circulating as liquid staking derivatives, the network’s structure created friction that slowed panic selling. Even as derivatives unwound, validator capital stayed put, blunting what could have been a full liquidity spiral. But as postmortems roll in, many fingers are pointing at Binance. Dragonfly's Haseeb Qureshi questions if Ethena really depegged, arguing that instead $60–$90 million in USDe, along with wBETH and BNSOL, was dumped on Binance, exploiting a pricing flaw that valued collateral using Binance’s own order book instead of external oracles. As Binance’s infrastructure buckled under heavy load, market makers were unable to hedge or rebalance positions, the thesis goes, causing wrapped assets to decouple from their underlying prices and deepening the selloff. The localized collapse drove USDe to $0.65 on Binance only, while it held near $1 on Curve and Bybit. Because Binance’s unified margin system marked collateral to its internal prices, the drop instantly wiped out hundreds of millions in margin value, triggering forced liquidations across assets. Ethena’s USDe protocol remained fully collateralized and redeemable throughout, suggesting the chaos was an exchange-side failure, not a stablecoin depeg. Binance has since acknowledged “platform-related issues,” moved to oracle-based collateral pricing, and pledged compensation for affected traders. In hindsight, Friday’s crash looks less like a stablecoin panic and more like a masterclass in exploiting an exchange's weakest structural link. In a post on X , Yi He, Binance's co-founder and chief customer service officer admitted that the exchange had brief service delays and temporary depegs in some yield products but said these occurred after the broader market drop. Binance added that over $280 million in compensation has already been paid to affected users and reaffirmed that it will not cover ordinary market losses. For now, crypto’s cleanout has given way to a measured rebound, one led by the assets that fell hardest and reset the deepest. Market Movement BTC: Bitcoin steadied around $115,000 after falling nearly 9% on Friday and recovering about 4% over the weekend as traders unwound shorts and broader risk sentiment began to stabilize. ETH: Ether rebounded to about $4,150 after dropping nearly 17% on Friday, recovering faster than Bitcoin as leveraged positions cleared and DeFi activity picked back up. Gold: Gold surged to a record $4,059.87 per ounce in early Asian trading on Monday as escalating U.S.–China trade tensions, renewed geopolitical risks, and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts fueled demand for safe-haven assets.

BTC is now struggling and might face hurdles near the $116,000 level. Bitcoin started a recovery wave above the $113,500 resistance level. The price is trading below $116,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $119,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move down if it trades below the $113,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Starts Recovery Bitcoin price started a recovery wave after a massive liquidation event below $110,000. BTC recovered above the $111,500 and $112,000 resistance levels. The price climbed above the 50% Fib retracement level of the sharp decline from the $123,750 swing high to the $100,000 low. The bulls even pushed the price above the $113,500 resistance level. However, there are many hurdles on the upside. Bitcoin is now trading below $116,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . Besides, there is a bearish trend line forming with resistance at $119,500 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $116,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $116,250 level. The next resistance could be $118,000 and the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the sharp decline from the $123,750 swing high to the $100,000 low. A close above the $118,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $119,500 resistance and the trend line. Any more gains might send the price toward the $120,000 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $122,500. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $116,000 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support is near the $114,000 level. The first major support is near the $113,500 level. The next support is now near the $113,500 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $112,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $110,500, below which BTC might struggle to recover in the short term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone.

Here’s the Sign,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-your-xrp-moment-is-near-heres-the-sign/,"Amonyx (@amonbuy), a well-known crypto commentator, recently posted on X that XRP’s moment could be near. His remark came in response to an analysis by XRPunkie (@Shawnmark7899) that compares XRP’s current market structure to its historical movement in 2017 and 2018. The suggestion is that XRP may be repeating a technical pattern that previously led to a sharp upward move. The timing and framing of Amonyx’s post immediately caught the interest of market watchers, as the historical data presented implies that XRP could soon experience a sharp upward move. His statement hinted at renewed optimism for the token’s medium-term trajectory, especially as the digital asset consolidates near major support zones . This tweet is a sign — your $XRP moment is near https://t.co/dkgfSLfEIj — Amonyx (@amonbuy) October 11, 2025 Technical Parallels Between 2017 and 2025 In the analysis, XRPunkie noted that “there’s some similarity to what’s happening with $XRP back in 2017/2018 and today.” The chart he shared shows XRP on a weekly timeframe with exponential moving averages and a set of parallel trendlines extending across multiple years. The visual comparison highlights a recurring structure, showing a long wick testing the lowest trendline support, followed by a significant market recovery. In 2017, XRP experienced a sharp rebound after testing that same type of structural base. The current pattern, as illustrated in the 2025 section of the chart, appears to mirror that event, showing another deep wick toward lower support before potential continuation within the same ascending channel. The setup has led some traders to speculate that XRP could again follow a similar path upward, provided the support level holds. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Chart Interpretation and Potential Outcomes The chart projects possible future extensions using Fibonacci levels. Key markers appear at 9.1146 (Fib. 1.272), 15.0450 (Fib. 1.414), and 30.9 (Fib. 1.618). The highlighted green zone on the right side of the image suggests the range in which XRP could rally if price behavior mirrors the previous cycle. A yellow circle marks the current point of contact with the lower trendline, matching the trajectory observed in 2017 before XRP’s surge. This visual cue reinforces the notion that technical conditions may be aligning for a similar response. While the analysis stops short of confirming an imminent move, the historical correlation forms the basis of Amonyx’s confidence. At the time of the analysis, XRP traded at $2.39. The token has maintained a steady performance within its long-term channel despite fluctuations across the broader digital asset market. For traders following historical cycles, the similarity to 2017’s setup makes a compelling case for a rapid ascent in the short term.

The price is now showing positive signs but faces a major hurdle near the $2.60 level. XRP price is attempting a recovery wave above the $2.50 zone. The price is now trading below $2.60 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.660 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh decline if it settles below $2.70. XRP Price Starts Recovery XRP price found support and started a strong recovery wave above $2.0, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price was able to climb above the $2.20 and $2.25 levels to enter a positive zone. There was a decent increase above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low. However, the price could face hurdles near $2.60. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $2.660 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.60 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.60 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.660 level and the trend line. It is close to the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3.05 swing high to the $1.40 swing low. A clear move above the $2.660 resistance might send the price toward the $2.70 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.720 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.80. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $2.60 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.450 level. The next major support is near the $2.40 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.40 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.320. The next major support sits near the $2.30 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.250. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $2.450 and $2.40.

Dash price has jumped by over 50% in the last 24 hours, while MNT, ASTER, and Morpho have risen by over 30%. Bitcoin price has also surged from last week’s low of $108,000 to $115,500 today. Crypto market rally happens amid trade optimism The primary reason why the crypto market rally is happening is the view that the trade war between the US and China will de-escalate soon. In a Truth Social post, Donald Trump asked market participants not to be worried about the potential trade war. His statement came shortly after JD Vance, the vice president, left the door open for de-escalation, noting that the US had more cards over China. These statements came two days after Donald Trump warned that the US would impose major tariffs against China. He said this after China unveiled new measures, including a threat to limit rare earth materials exports, new tariffs on US ships docking in its shores, and an investigation into Qualcomm. In a statement on Sunday, Beijing reiterated that its actions were a response to US policy. Just recently, the Trump administration tightened the screws on its export controls policy. Therefore, the two sides will likely work to reach a trade agreement ahead of the Trump and Xi Jinping meeting in South Korea. Crypto investors are buying the dip The ongoing crypto market rally is happening as investors buy the dip. This is evidenced by the ongoing volume and open interest surge. The volume in the spot market rose by 4.20% in the last 24 hours to over $262 billion. Data compiled by CoinGlass shows that the open interest has jumped by almost 10% $162 billion, in the last 24 hours. Historically, cryptocurrencies bounce back sharply after a big drop as market participants buy the dip expecting that the rally will intensify. They also buy the dip as they aim to recoup some of their losses. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts hopes Bitcoin and altcoins are going up as investors predict that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting rates as the government shutdown continues and threats to the US economy remain. There are chances that the economy will remain under pressure in the coming weeks. For one, the Trump administration has started firing government workers as it increases its pressure on Democrats. A recent report by ADP noted that the economy lost over 36,000 jobs in September. While the BLS did not publish the official report, analysts believe that the labor market was not all that strong. As such, the odds of more rate cuts by the Fed have jumped, which will help to support the crypto market. Potential dead-cat bounce The biggest risk that the crypto market faces today is that the ongoing rally may be part of a dead-cat bounce or DCB. A DCB, also known a a bull trap, is a situation where a falling asset bounces back temporarily and then resumes the downtrend. Looking forward, the crypto market will likely be volatile as traders focus on the trade talks between the US and China, and the government shutdown.

We've probably all heard this phrase: ""Once is an accident, twice is a coincidence, three times is a pattern."" The old saying is perfectly applicable to the bitcoin (BTC) market, where the crash on Friday marked the third time bulls failed to maintain gains above the critical trendline drawn from the 2017 and 2021 highs, raising the possibility of a deeper drop to $100,000 or lower. This repeated inability to hold above that level highlights a persistent resistance, suggesting that the trendline is now a key battleground likely defining the limits of the bullish strength in this cycle. CoinDesk highlighted the trendline resistance a month ago, noting that bulls had twice failed to maintain gains above it. The long wicks on the July, August, and October candles signal bull fatigue above the trendline. At the same time, the MACD histogram on the monthly chart – although still positive – is lower than it was during the December-January rally when BTC first broke above $100,000, indicating a weakening of upward momentum. MACD, a moving average-based indicator, is widely used to identify trend changes and trend strength. The daily chart below also paints a bearish picture. The sharp reversal from the expanding channel resistance, combined with negative readings in both the standard (12, 26, 9) and longer-term (50, 100, 9) MACD histograms, signals that the path of least resistance is downward. The longer duration histogram, which uses 50- and 100-day EMAs and a 9-day EMA to smooth the signal, is significantly slower and less sensitive than the default setting, but better suited for filtering out short-term market noise. Taken together, the monthly and daily charts suggest scope for a drop to sub-$100K levels, marking a test of the lower end of the expanding triangle. On the way lower, the 200-day simple moving average at $107,000 could also offer support. Bulls will need to engineer a break above $121,800 to invalidate the series of lower highs and overturn the bearish outlook. At press time, BTC changed hands at $114,800, according to CoinDesk data.",Markets|Bitcoin|Technical Analysis|Markets|News,EN,0,0,BTC|CRYPTOCURRENCY|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-10-13 04:26:05

Trump struck a softer tone, calling President Xi Jinping “highly respected” and saying the US wanted to “help” rather than “hurt” China , despite friction over rare earth exports and looming tariff increases. Leverage Unwind Wiped Out Nearly $20B in Crypto Bets Markets had been reeling since Friday, when Trump’s announcement of an extra 100% tariffs on Chinese imports sparked a global sell-off. The sharp decline hit late Saturday, when Bitcoin fell below $110,000 and Ethereum tumbled more than 20% within hours. As risk assets slid, crypto traders faced mass liquidations amplified by thin liquidity and automated selling across platforms such as Binance, OKX and Bybit. Further, the Crypto Fear and Greed Index plummeted from 64 , signaling “greed,” to 27, indicating “fear,” in under a day. More than 1.6m traders were liquidated, with total losses surpassing $19.3b. Some estimates place the real figure closer to $30b, as certain exchanges only report one liquidation order per second. Crypto Fear and Greed Index crashed from 64 to 27 after Trump’s 100% tariff shock — over $19.33B liquidated and $1T erased from the market in three hours. More crash ahead? #Bitcoin #Ethereum https://t.co/ZPzP74ngrh — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) October 11, 2025 Fears of Escalating Trade War Cloud Outlook for Global Growth, Risk Assets Including Crypto The scale of the losses rivaled the May 2021 crash, when excessive leverage similarly fueled a rapid chain reaction of forced selling. Analysts said this latest event reflected the same structural vulnerabilities in crypto markets of high leverage, limited liquidity during off-hours and reflexive selling driven by algorithmic trades. Greg Magadini, director of derivatives at Amberdata, said the real concern now lies in whether China retaliates. “The risk isn’t the tariffs themselves, it’s whether China responds with aggressive countermeasures,” he said. “A full-scale trade war between the world’s two largest economies would create substantial headwinds for global growth.” He added that trading patterns already indicate investors are moving toward safer positions, with signs of strain emerging across multiple asset classes. “Cryptocurrencies are under pressure, and the flight to Treasuries reflects genuine concerns about economic momentum,” Magadini said. For now, Trump’s remarks appear to have steadied sentiment. Crypto traders welcomed the signs of diplomatic outreach, even as volatility remains elevated.

A recent post from Dom (@traderview2) offered a vivid look at this phenomenon through a chart comparing Binance’s and Coinbase’s XRP spot markets. Both charts captured the same event in real time, showing a sharp liquidity disappearance that preceded XRP’s steep fall from above $2.8 to below $1.50. Liquidity Vanishes in Seconds The data in Dom’s post reveal a synchronized withdrawal of orders across major exchanges moments before the price cascade. The visual shows the order book depth within 50% of the quoted price contracting rapidly, leaving a thin market with few bids to absorb selling pressure. In practical terms, this means that as sell orders increased, the absence of nearby buy orders magnified the impact of each trade. Without adequate liquidity to cushion the descent, XRP’s price fell sharply across platforms, hitting a low point it has not reached since June . The TradingLite chart’s Orderbook Suite indicator clearly illustrates this imbalance, with a deep negative swing marking the point of collapse. Look at how quickly liquidity vanished on $XRP spot markets right before the massive part of the cascade Orderbook depth +/-50% of the quote price just gone This is a visualization of how these exact moves can happen… We can only speculate… pic.twitter.com/9icJa0btKf — Dom (@traderview2) October 11, 2025 A Fragile Market Structure Dom’s observation indicates high volatility during liquidity shocks, which is a core feature of modern digital asset markets. In spot markets like XRP’s, where price discovery occurs in real time, even a temporary reduction in resting orders can amplify moves that would otherwise remain contained. The synchronized behavior on Binance and Coinbase suggests that liquidity providers may have stepped back simultaneously, either through algorithmic withdrawal or automated protection triggers. This event also came at a crucial technical juncture for XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 After months of trading close to $3, the market had shown signs of fatigue near the $2.8 range, forming resistance as momentum slowed. When liquidity thinned, the sell-off accelerated. That breakdown signals a potential shift in market structure, as buyers who previously defended that threshold were unable to maintain support . What Comes Next for XRP? The recovery since the flash drop has been steady but limited, with prices fluctuating between roughly $2.30 and $2.50 in the following seasons. This consolidation reflects cautious re-entry from traders still assessing market depth after the event. If liquidity continues to rebuild and volume stabilizes, XRP could retest the $2.6 to $2.8 range where the decline began. However, if bid density remains low, volatility could persist, leaving the token vulnerable to renewed downward pressure.

53070973,https://nulltx.com/?p=152336,1760332655,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,BNB Chain Leads Global User Activity Across All Layer-1 Networks,https://nulltx.com/bnb-chain-leads-global-user-activity-across-all-layer-1-networks/,"BNB Chain is back at the top. The network continues to lead the Layer-1 ecosystem with 58.9 million monthly active users, one of its highest levels of onchain activity to date. The milestone, highlighted by @CryptoMiners_Co, cements BNB Chain’s position as the most-used blockchain among major L1s, well ahead of NEAR Protocol and Solana. According to data from Token Terminal, the top three active Layer-1s are: BNB Chain, 58.9M users NEAR Protocol, 50.3M users Solana, 37.3M users While other chains have had brief bursts of user activity tied to specific hype waves, BNB Chain’s growth has been consistent and organic, driven by strong user retention, scalable infrastructure, and a thriving developer community. BNB Chain’s Ecosystem Momentum The numbers tell a clear story, BNB Chain has become a gravity center for Web3 adoption. From gaming to DeFi to NFT marketplaces, activity across the network has surged through 2024 and into 2025. BNB Chain’s multi-sector reach is what gives it this edge. DeFi platforms like PancakeSwap, Venus, and Uniswap V3 (BNB) continue to post strong trading volumes, ensuring deep liquidity within the network. Meanwhile, the gaming sector has exploded, with over 1,500 active Web3 games running on BNB Chain. Popular titles such as X World Games, BinaryX, and SecondLive have drawn millions of players, contributing to the rise in daily transactions. This ecosystem strength reflects a pattern: users aren’t just visiting, they’re staying. BNB Chain’s retention metrics show sustained engagement across months, proving that the network’s activity isn’t inflated by temporary hype or airdrop farming. opBNB: The Layer-2 Accelerator One of the biggest growth catalysts behind this surge is opBNB, the Layer-2 scaling solution built on the Optimism OP Stack. Since its launch, opBNB has become the fastest-growing L2 in the BNB ecosystem, processing tens of millions of transactions monthly with gas fees averaging below $0.001. This cost efficiency, combined with full EVM compatibility, makes it a magnet for developers migrating from Ethereum and Polygon. The opBNB expansion has also attracted a new wave of DeFi and gaming projects aiming to leverage BNB’s liquidity depth with L2 scalability. Data from BNB Chain Explorer shows steady transaction growth across the last six months, a strong indicator of increasing adoption beyond speculative trading. Comparing the Competition BNB Chain’s 58.9M monthly users place it nearly 17% ahead of NEAR Protocol, which sits at 50.3M. NEAR has seen significant traction from consumer apps like Sweat Economy and Kai-Ching, but its ecosystem breadth still trails behind BNB’s multi-sector dominance. Solana, meanwhile, remains the third most active chain at 37.3M users, boosted by its DeFi and memecoin resurgence in mid-2025. However, Solana continues to face periodic network stress during peak traffic, a challenge BNB Chain’s multi-layer architecture has largely avoided. CoinMarketCap data shows BNB’s market cap hovering around $170 billion, maintaining its spot among the top four crypto assets globally. This strength reinforces BNB’s role as not just a blockchain, but a core pillar of the Web3 economy. Why BNB Chain Keeps Winning The secret behind BNB Chain’s dominance is a blend of user experience, affordability, and reach. Transaction fees remain some of the lowest among major L1s, averaging under $0.05 per transaction. Network uptime is near-perfect, and validator participation remains stable, even during market-wide volatility. In 2025, BNB Chain has also doubled down on its developer programs. The BNB Greenfield initiative, focused on decentralized storage, and opBNB’s ecosystem grants have attracted hundreds of projects, ensuring constant innovation. Beyond tech, Binance’s influence as an exchange ecosystem still plays a role. The direct integration of BNB Chain dApps within Binance Wallet and Web3 features has helped onboard millions of users seamlessly into onchain activity. It’s a loop that keeps growing: the exchange drives traffic to the chain, and the chain sustains user demand through real utility. Long-Term Sustainability The real story here isn’t just numbers, it’s resilience. BNB Chain has managed to grow through one of the most volatile market cycles in crypto history. From the meme coin boom on BNB to the rise of L2 solutions like opBNB, the network has evolved without breaking under congestion or cost pressure. That reliability has built trust among developers and retail users alike, ensuring that even when new L1s emerge, BNB Chain remains the default home for scalable Web3 deployment. This consistent expansion paints a picture of a network maturing beyond speculation, one that’s laying long-term infrastructure for consumer-level blockchain adoption. BNB Chain’s success story also stems from its community-first ethos. Through local hackathons, incubation programs, and the “Build the Future” campaign, BNB has built a culture that rewards creators, not just traders. The result? A self-sustaining flywheel of innovation. Developers build, users engage, and liquidity flows back into the ecosystem. That balance, between scalability and usability, is what continues to keep BNB Chain far ahead of the pack. BNB Chain’s Position in 2025 As of October 2025, BNB Chain isn’t just surviving the market cycle, it’s shaping it. While most chains battle retention issues or rely on external hype, BNB’s core ecosystem has stayed active and profitable. Its steady dominance in user activity, DeFi liquidity, and gaming engagement signals that BNB Chain has quietly become the benchmark for real Web3 traction. The network’s capacity to integrate scaling (opBNB), innovation (Greenfield), and adoption (Binance Wallet) makes it the most comprehensive blockchain stack in the current market. BNB Chain’s journey from a fast-trading chain to a multi-layer, multi-sector ecosystem shows how far it has come, and how much further it can go. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The decentralized derivatives platform recorded 100% uptime and zero bad debt, even as billions of dollars in positions were liquidated across the ecosystem. According to founder Jeff, this was the first time in over two years that Hyperliquid activated its cross-margin Auto-Deleveraging (ADL) mechanism, a key safeguard used only in extreme conditions. “During recent volatility, Hyperliquid had 100% uptime with zero bad debt,” Jeff wrote. “This was Hyperliquid’s first cross-margin ADL in more than two years of operation.” TLDR: During recent volatility, Hyperliquid had 100% uptime with zero bad debt. This was Hyperliquid’s first cross-margin ADL in more than 2 years of operation. ADL does not change the outcome for any liquidated users. While some specific ADL providing trades were unfavorable,… — jeff.hl (@chameleon_jeff) October 11, 2025 While some specific ADL trades were unfavorable, Jeff emphasized that, in aggregate, the mechanism allowed traders to capture substantial profits through brief favorable liquidations. Solvency and Uptime Take Center Stage Jeff addressed criticism directed toward Hyperliquid following the event, describing it as “sad” that some were attacking the platform to deflect from their own technical failures. “Solvency and uptime are the two most important properties of a financial system,” he said. “Gaslighting users to believe otherwise is unethical and irresponsible.” The founder reaffirmed that Hyperliquid’s design priorities, solvency, transparency, and fairness, are non-negotiable. Every trade, liquidation, and margin event remains verifiable onchain, offering a level of transparency that few competitors match. Liquidations and System Design When markets swing violently, liquidation systems are pushed to their limits. Jeff used the opportunity to explain how Hyperliquid’s margining system handled the chaos. In a perpetuals market, every position must be backed by a maintenance margin, the minimum collateral required to stay solvent. When the collateral falls short, the system takes over the position and liquidates it. Earlier in the day, many altcoins had dropped over 50% in minutes. That forced 2x-leveraged or higher long positions into liquidation. Hyperliquid’s transparent liquidation engine ensured that these liquidations were executed systematically to prevent bad debt. Billions of dollars in open interest were liquidated in under 20 minutes, all visible onchain. In a permissionless system, each trader manages their own leverage and collateralization. If a platform fails to liquidate undercollateralized users in time, it risks endangering everyone’s funds. Jeff pointed out that while other exchanges may underreport liquidation data, Hyperliquid’s full onchain visibility means “you see everything, the good, the bad, and the volatile.” HLP: The Backstop of Last Resort Central to Hyperliquid’s stability is HLP, a protocol vault with permissionless deposits. It serves two purposes, providing order book liquidity and performing backstop liquidations when the market cannot absorb all liquidations normally. While its market share in order book trading is negligible (less than 1%), its liquidation role is critical. Here’s how it works: If the order book lacks liquidity to close an undercollateralized position, HLP steps in. It takes over the position and its collateral. For risk management, HLP is split into multiple child vaults, with each liquidation assigned to one vault. This structure allows the system to isolate risk, ensuring that even when one vault absorbs heavy losses, others remain stable. The Role of Auto-Deleveraging (ADL) Auto-Deleveraging is the final safety mechanism, the “last resort” liquidation event that activates when both market and backstop systems are exhausted. Each ADL event has two sides: The triggered side, the undercollateralized position. The providing side, selected based on leverage and profitability. In most cases, ADL providers are profitable overall, but outcomes can vary per event. Some ADL trades perform poorly, especially when only part of a portfolio is closed. Jeff emphasized that Hyperliquid’s system minimizes ADL triggers because they are unpredictable, even if the average outcome benefits the market. This week’s activation marked the first cross-margin ADL on Hyperliquid mainnet since launch. In contrast, isolated assets such as hyperps see more frequent ADLs since they’re not backstopped by HLP. Inside the 20-Minute Liquidation Window Over roughly 20 minutes, HLP liquidated billions of dollars in positions as altcoins tumbled. HLP’s role isn’t to profit, it’s to maintain system solvency. The vault doesn’t pick and choose liquidations based on profitability. Instead, it operates as a public good, ensuring all users remain protected during sharp market dislocations. HLP charges no liquidation fees. Its child vault architecture, designed through countless simulations, ensures that the system maximizes protection while managing its own risk. During the event, several child vaults themselves became temporarily undercollateralized after taking on massive user positions. This was intentional: their isolation prevents risk from spilling over into the rest of the protocol. HLP was even the largest address group on the triggered side of ADL, by more than an order of magnitude. Traders on the providing side of these ADL events collectively realized hundreds of millions of dollars in additional profit, capturing momentary dislocation windows that closed within seconds. Transparency Sets Hyperliquid Apart Jeff contrasted Hyperliquid’s design with that of other venues where liquidation mechanisms are opaque and internally managed. On those exchanges, liquidation engines might operate with different margin requirements or selectively backstop positions to protect exchange revenue, potentially at the cost of solvency risk. “On some venues, exchanges could have liquidated more positions and extracted hundreds of millions in revenue,” Jeff noted. “That’s not an acceptable tradeoff for Hyperliquid.” Transparency and onchain verifiability are at the heart of the protocol’s credibility. Every liquidation event, every ADL, and every fund movement is public, not obscured by internal matching systems or offchain reports. Jeff concluded his post by recognizing the difficulties traders faced during the market crash but reaffirmed his commitment to building a transparent and resilient system. “I know this is a difficult time for many traders,” he said. “As a contributor to Hyperliquid, I’ll keep working to build the best platform that can house all of finance.” He urged the community to stay united, pointing out that times like this reveal the importance of fairness and transparency in financial systems. The event was not just a test of market participants, it was a real-world stress test for Hyperliquid’s design. And by all accounts, the system passed.

News Background The recovery follows a 50 % wipe-out triggered by President Trump’s 100 % China-tariff declaration, which wiped $19 billion in crypto liquidations in minutes. Renewed buying has since restored confidence, with analysts eyeing a potential record weekly close above $3.12 that would mark XRP’s strongest candle since inception. Broader markets remain risk-off—Dow –900, Nasdaq –820—but crypto desks flagged selective institutional inflows into XRP. Price Action Summary XRP jumped 8.5 % between Oct 12 05:00 and Oct 13 04:00, trading a $0.22 (9 %) range $2.37–$2.59. Breakout bursts hit during 14:00–17:00 as volumes spiked to 276.8 M—over 2× daily average (118 M). Support confirmed at $2.37 with high-volume reversals; resistance formed near $2.59. Late-session push through $2.57 closed at $2.58 on 2.3 M turnover, validating continuation. Technical Analysis Structure now shows a clean ascending channel: $2.37 base, $2.59 lid. Sustained closes above $2.59 could open $2.70–$2.75, while failure to defend $2.50 risks retrace toward $2.42. Momentum remains bullish with institutional prints leading each breakout leg. Analysts highlight the breakout above $2.57 as confirmation of a near-term trend reversal; continued volume support keeps upside bias intact. What Traders Are Watching? Whether $2.57 holds as the new support pivot. Break above $2.59 to target $2.70–$2.75; stretch goal $3.00+. Trade-war headlines and Fed rhetoric driving cross-asset risk appetite.

While Zhao confirmed he applied for a pardon, he explained that he was never charged with fraud. The decision, however, could be complicated by Trump’s own ties to the crypto sector through ventures like World Liberty Financial and the TRUMP meme coin. CZ Could Receive Trump Pardon The Trump administration is reportedly considering a pardon for Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, who pleaded guilty to a money laundering violation in 2024 and served four months in prison. According to Fox Business correspondent Charles Gasparino , sources close to Zhao claim that Trump insiders see the case as weak and undeserving of a felony conviction or jail time. Gasparino even suggested that a pardon could pave the way for Zhao’s return to Binance, where he is still the largest shareholder. Under the Trump administration, the White House adopted a much friendlier stance toward the crypto industry. It already moved to end long-running enforcement actions, advanced new regulatory frameworks, and issued pardons to people like BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes and his colleagues, as well as Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht. Zhao acknowledged Gasparino’s report on X but stopped short of confirming any direct knowledge of a potential pardon. In his response, he also clarified that he was not charged with fraud, but instead pleaded guilty to a single violation of the Banking Secrecy Act — a rare instance that he claims made him the only person in US history to receive a prison sentence for such a charge without any prior offenses. Zhao’s conviction came after Binance reached a $4.3 billion settlement with US authorities in November of 2023. As part of the agreement, Zhao paid a $50 million fine, resigned as CEO, and was barred from working for the exchange. Gasparino said that while a decision on the pardon could be announced soon, some officials in the White House are concerned about how it might look given President Trump’s own connections to the crypto sector. Trump and his family previously faced scrutiny for their involvement in digital asset ventures, including the World Liberty Financial protocol and the TRUMP meme coin. The columnist added that the situation is still fluid, as the president is currently occupied with other high-priority matters, including the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, and trade talks with China.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|EXCHANGE|BNB|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-13 05:30:00

Institutional desks led the breakout, pushing volume to four times its daily average as momentum indicators flipped decisively bullish. Traders are now watching for confirmation above $0.22 to extend gains toward $0.24–$0.25. News Background DOGE’s 11% rally unfolded from Oct. 12 05:00 to Oct. 13 04:00, climbing from $0.19 to $0.21 after peaking at $0.22. The move coincided with a surge in institutional activity and a broader rebound across meme-coins. Analysts cited increasing open interest and heavy on-chain accumulation as signs of professional flows re-entering the market.

Resistance sits tight at $0.22, where multiple attempts are testing supply. The pattern shows an ascending trendline with constructive momentum; MACD and RSI signals remain bullish.

The pressure on regional equities persisted despite a late attempt at reassurance from President Donald Trump, who wrote on Truth Social, ""Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine."" On the geopolitical front, Trump said on Sunday that the Gaza war has ended as he flew to Israel for the release of hostages. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) steadied around $115,000 on Monday after a sharp selloff last week, as US President Donald Trump walked back his threat to impose massive tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that trade relations with the country “will all be fine.” Gold scaled an all-time peak of $4,070 per ounce on Monday, as renewed US-China trade concerns and economic uncertainty boosted safe-haven demand. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 1.01%. The Japanese yen weakened toward 152 per dollar in thin holiday trading on Monday, reversing some of the previous session’s gains. In Japan, markets reassessed the odds that LDP leader Sanae Takaichi will become prime minister and roll out fresh fiscal stimulus after Komeito quit the ruling coalition on Friday, ending a partnership of more than 25 years over what it called Takaichi’s failure to “provide sufficient answers regarding political funding issues.” China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.72% to around 3,860 while the Shenzhen Component dropped 2.3% to 13,050 on Monday, extending losses from the previous session after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese goods in response to Beijing’s new export controls on rare earth minerals, and the offshore yuan edged higher to around 7.14 per dollar on Monday. China vowed to retaliate if the tariffs are implemented. However, Trump later signaled openness to negotiate ahead of a possible meeting with President Xi Jinping later this month, saying that trade relations with China “will all be fine.” China posted a $90.45 billion trade surplus in September 2025 . Exports grew 8.3% ( y/y ) to $328.6 billion, marking a seven-month high and exceeding expectations. Imports also accelerated, rising 7.4% ( y/y ) to $238.1 billion. Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 2.63% to 25,776 on Monday morning, marking the sixth session of losses and the lowest level in a month. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.33% to 82,178 in morning trade on Monday, halting gains from the previous two sessions as renewed US-China trade tensions rattled investor sentiment. Australia ( AS51 ) fell 0.84% to 8,910 on Monday, extending losses from the previous week as weakness in the mining and energy sectors continued to pressure the index. The Australian dollar rose toward $0.653 on Monday, rebounding from significant losses in the previous week, as investor sentiment improved following reassuring comments from President Donald Trump amid rising tensions in the US-China trade dispute. Australia is considering mandated floor prices for critical minerals and new funding for rare earth projects as part of a proposed resources deal with the U.S., the Age reported Sunday. Domestically, investors are closely watching for the release of the RBA meeting minutes, upcoming speeches by central bank officials, and key labor market data expected in the coming days. In the U.S. on Friday, all three major indexes ended lower retreating from recent highs after President Donald Trump rattled markets with threats of a “massive” tariff hike on Chinese goods and suggested he might cancel his upcoming meeting with President Xi Jinping. Investors now await earnings results from major banks later this week, including from Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley. U.S. stock futures climbed on Monday after President Donald Trump suggested he may scale back his threat to impose steep new tariffs on China: Dow +0.87% ; S&P 500 +1.27% ; Nasdaq +1.70%.

With the recent purchase, the company holds a total of 53,250 BTC, worth $6.12 billion.

MARA’s Bitcoin Strategy is Both Aggressive and Innovative MARA, formerly known as Marathon Digital Holdings, has been highly active in expanding its Bitcoin reserve throughout late 2024 and early 2025. MARA’s Bitcoin holdings reached 49,951 BTC by the end of June, a 170% increase year-over-year, valued at $5.3 billion. “We are more than a bitcoin treasury company,” MARA said in its July Q2 2025 report . Besides, the firm has been expanding its focus beyond mining. It recently announced partnerships with Google-backed TAE Power Solutions and LG-backed PADO AI to co-develop energy-efficient platforms tailored for AI and next-gen data centers. According to CEO Fred Thiel, the company aims to scale to 75 EH/s by the end of 2025. “Our vertically integrated mining operations, large BTC treasury, budding international energy partnerships, and early AI infrastructure investments each contribute distinct and measurable value,” Thiel said in July. MARA Buys BTC Despite Stock Decline The leading BTC miner saw its stock price decline by 9.33% on October 10 and later recovered slightly by 2.66%. The company’s stocks are currently trading at $19.13, according to Yahoo Finance . The downturn is primarily attributed to mixed options sentiment, which overshadowed the company’s strategic initiatives and operational successes.

This led to a cascade of liquidations as traders scrambled to save their positions. Now, though, with the liquidation event out of the way and the market looking to be bouncing back, things are beginning to look up for the PEPE price, which one analyst believes is primed for a monster rally from here. PEPE Price Is Set To Soar Crypto analyst MMBTtrader took to the TradingView website to share their view of what could be happening with the PEPE price. According to the analyst, the PEPE price decline was expected , but not as fast as it played out. Nevertheless, it plays into the bigger picture and the reset that the meme coin needed. MMBTtrader explains that the path for the PEPE price is now clear as it is ready to rally. They point out that the red long candle that sent the altcoin spiraling could’ve been the result of market manipulation. This is a thought that many in the space share, especially with many altcoins basically crashing up to 80% in a single candle. However, the crypto analyst believes that a move like this is only the precursor of something big that is coming for the market. With liquidations rising by over $19 billion on Friday, it marked the single largest liquidation event in the history of crypto, and many believe this is a needed reset for the market. The crypto analyst explains that the move was indeed needed to hunt and kick out leverage traders, regardless of their positions. In the aftermath of it all, most long traders were affected, regardless of how high or how low their leverage was. Data from the Coinglass website shows that some crypto exchanges recorded up to 96% of all liquidations for that day being long traders. Looking at the chart shared by the crypto analyst, the PEPE price has bounced back above major monthly support. This support sits at the $0.000005 level, and since bulls have so far held above it, it could be the take-off point for the next upward rally. If this level holds, then there are multiple levels of interest for the PEPE price . The first stop in the bounce would be the $0.00001 level, where most of the resistance has lain over the last few months. Once broken, though, this would set the stage for the rally as it moves up rapidly. The next stage of the rally would be the $0.000013 level as bears begin to put up a fight. By this level, though, the PEPE price would be almost 100% up . Then the next major level would be the $0.000016, the point to be broken. If all of the resistances along the way are evenly surpassed, then the crypto analyst sees the PEPE price reaching new all-time highs . The target from here would be the $0.00003047 level, which the analyst refers to as the final goal, completing a 230% move.",PEPE|Pepe|pepe coin|PEPE news|PEPE price|PEPEUSD|PEPEUSDT,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|TRADING|PEPE|MARKET|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-13 06:00:06

Here’s What It Means,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-the-upside-is-obvious-heres-what-it-means/,"Max Avery, a well-known figure in crypto and finance circles, recently shared his views on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and its growing relevance in the evolving tokenization landscape. His comments provided a grounded perspective on what many XRP holders believe to be a significant turning point for the network. While the digital asset market continues to fluctuate, Avery’s remarks stand out for their focus on tangible growth rather than relying on speculation and investor optimism. Institutional Integration and Real Utility Avery stated that “every time a new institution starts using the XRP Ledger to issue or trade tokenized assets, it adds volume, activity, and real-world use.” His point highlights a growing movement among blockchain projects to attract institutional adoption, but in XRP’s case, the focus is firmly on practical utility rather than speculation. Over the past few years, Ripple’s work with the XRPL has progressed steadily toward creating a framework capable of handling institutional-grade asset tokenization . As markets worldwide transition into the digital age, XRP is poised to dominate the emerging tokenization space. For XRP holders, the upside’s obvious. Every time a new institution starts using the XRP Ledger to issue or trade tokenized assets, it adds volume, activity, and real-world use Ripple’s been focused on turning the XRPL into the plumbing for trillions in tokenized assets with… — Max Avery (@realMaxAvery) October 11, 2025 Ripple’s Infrastructure Vision Ripple has been positioning the XRPL as the infrastructure backbone for the digitization and tokenization of real-world assets, which is the next phase of global finance. According to Avery, Ripple’s focus is directed toward transforming the ledger into “the plumbing for trillions in tokenized assets.” This statement aligns with the company’s long-term vision of embedding XRP within financial systems that require speed, compliance, and interoperability. What separates XRP from competing digital assets is its readiness for institutional use. The XRPL’s performance and scalability have been tested across multiple pilot programs and partnerships involving central bank digital currencies and tokenized commodities. These efforts have established a foundation that supports Avery’s perspective that the XRPL is not an experimental blockchain but one designed for real-world financial integration. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Perception and Institutional Reality Despite Ripple’s progress, skepticism continues to shape public perception of XRP. Much of the market still views it primarily through a speculative lens rather than as a piece of financial infrastructure. Avery’s comments address this disconnect, suggesting that many fail to see or acknowledge the progress taking place in real time. He noted that XRP’s next-generation infrastructure is already taking shape in real-time, emphasizing that adoption is not a distant goal but an active process underway. Institutional participation has quietly expanded in sectors such as cross-border payments and asset tokenization. Each new integration of the XRPL into real-world use cases strengthens its position as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain systems .

London/Johannesburg, October 2025 — In an era of global economic uncertainty, one investment manager’s story is inspiring people worldwide to rediscover the potential of digital assets. Andy, 43, was once a successful investment manager handling multi-million-dollar portfolios in the fast-paced financial sector. His life revolved around boardrooms, clients, and high-stakes decisions. But a single investment failure changed everything — his career collapsed, his company downsized, and debts began to pile up. With mortgage payments, car loans, and three children’s tuition fees pressing on him, Andy found himself at rock bottom. “Every morning I still put on my suit, but I had nowhere to go,” Andy recalls. “That sense of loss was suffocating.” Starting today, all new users who register for SIM Mining will receive $100 in free hashrate.

While browsing a finance forum, Andy came across a discussion about cloud mining — a way to earn digital assets like Bitcoin without owning machines or managing complex hardware. As a former investment professional, skepticism came naturally. But phrases like “low entry barrier,” “transparent system,” and “secure platform” caught his attention. He began researching the compliance and reliability of several platforms and eventually chose SIM Mining, a UK-registered and regulated company. “ I trusted SIM Mining because its system is transparent, fully compliant, and easy to use. Even someone without technical expertise can get started in minutes ,” Andy said. From Doubt to Transformation The process was simple — create an account, deposit funds, and select a mining contract. Within 24 hours, Andy saw his first earnings appear in his account. “It wasn’t the amount that moved me,” he said. “It was the fact that I saw hope for the first time in years. That tiny number on my screen told me my life could change.” From then on, Andy’s daily mining rewards continued steadily. Within months, he paid off part of his debt and stabilized his family’s finances. SIM Mining: A Transparent, Secure, and Compliant Cloud Mining Platform Founded in 2018 and headquartered in the UK, SIM Mining is a legally registered cloud mining platform that allows users to participate in digital asset mining — including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP) — directly from their phone or computer. Its mining power is backed by professional data centers, and all earnings are automatically calculated and distributed daily. Users can monitor their profits, withdraw, or reinvest with just a few taps on their mobile device. “SIM Mining made complex blockchain mining as simple as opening a bank account,” Andy noted. “I can track my performance anytime, anywhere, and the transparency gives me peace of mind.” Today, SIM Mining serves millions of users globally and has undergone multiple institutional security and compliance audits. To help beginners get started, the platform also offers a $100 free starter credit, allowing users to experience cloud mining with zero financial risk. Rebuilding Confidence and a New Life Over the past three years, Andy has earned more than $800,000 through SIM Mining. But for him, the true value goes beyond money. “SIM Mining wasn’t just an investment tool — it was a bridge that carried me from despair to renewal,” he said. “It helped me stand tall again in my 40s and reminded me that the future is still worth believing in.” A New Path to Financial Freedom As inflation rises and traditional income sources struggle to keep pace, stories like Andy’s are showing a new side of digital finance. With its compliance, transparency, and accessibility, SIM Mining is providing individuals worldwide with a genuine path toward financial flexibility and independence.

In a post on X, Yan said Hyperliquid’s fully on-chain liquidation data could not be compared with what he called “underreported CEX liquidations.” He argued that on-chain systems allow anyone to verify trades, orders, and liquidations in real time, ensuring transparency and fairness for users. “Some CEXs publicly document that they dramatically underreport user liquidations,” Yan wrote, pointing to Binance as an example. “Even if there are thousands of liquidation orders in the same second, only one is reported. Because liquidations happen in bursts, this could easily be 100x underreporting under some conditions.” Hyperliquid’s fully onchain liquidations cannot be compared with underreported CEX liquidations Hyperliquid is a blockchain where every order, trade, and liquidation happens onchain.

Zhao, known widely as CZ, responded with a post that appeared to address the criticism indirectly. “Some people ask why is #BNB so strong?” he wrote. “While others tried to ignore, hide, shift blame, or attack competitors, the key @BNBChain ecosystem players (Binance, Venus, and more) took hundreds of millions out of their own pockets to PROTECT USERS,” he said.

Market Rout Sparks Tensions Between Binance, Hyperliquid The exchange of posts followed the Oct. 10–11 market crash that sent shockwaves through the crypto sector. Bitcoin plunged from $122,000 to $109,000, wiping out more than $19b in leveraged positions. CoinGlass described it as one of the largest liquidation cascades in crypto history, impacting over 1.6 million traders. During the chaos, Hyperliquid reportedly handled $50–$70b in trading volume without any downtime or disruption. Meanwhile, Binance experienced temporary technical issues that left some users unable to close positions for nearly an hour. As a result, frustration spread quickly across social media, with traders saying the delays deepened their losses. CZ Clarifies Binance Has No Current Ties to Hyperliquid Despite Past Incubation Links Zhao also reshared a post comparing liquidation rates, which showed Binance liquidating 60% of long positions while decentralized exchanges such as Hyperliquid saw closer to 90%. Last week, Zhao addressed speculation that Binance has investment ties to Hyperliquid . He clarified that while Jeff Yan participated in Binance Labs’ first incubation program in 2018 through a startup called YZiLabs, the company failed and Binance did not recover its investment. Hyperliquid has grown rapidly since its launch, operating on its own Layer-1 blockchain and ranking among the most active decentralized perpetual trading platforms. According to DefiLlama, it handled $319b in trading volume in July, contributing to a record $487b across DeFi perpetual markets that month.

The MACD remains in bearish territory, showing limited buying momentum, while the RSI at 33.94 indicates oversold conditions, hinting at a potential short-term rebound. The Bollinger Bands suggest high volatility, with price movement near the lower band signaling possible support around $0.0137. However, resistance stands near $0.0175, which may cap any upward attempts.

Traders hold 50% in MUTM,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/13/what-crypto-suits-a-20k-portfolio-traders-hold-50-in-mutm/,"For traders shaping a $20,000 crypto portfolio ahead of the 2026 bull run, one project has begun standing out across the DeFi world — Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Many seasoned investors are already placing half of their holdings, around $10,000, into this Ethereum-based protocol. Its ongoing presale, audited framework, and yield-based lending system have made it a core holding for those aiming to grow their crypto investment before prices rise further. The presale surge and why traders are taking position Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now deep into Phase 6 of its presale, raising $17.12 million overall with 62% of the available 170 million tokens sold. The current token price sits at $0.035, and Phase 7 will raise it by 15% to $0.040. With more than 16,850 holders, the project has already gained the attention of retail investors, DeFi enthusiasts, and whales alike. Investors who entered at Phase 1’s $0.01 price now hold 250% value growth, and when listings begin around $0.06, they are expected to see around 500% value gain. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s model revolves around a dual lending structure designed for flexibility and yield. In the Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system, users will deposit major assets such as ETH and DAI into audited smart contracts. These funds will then be used to issue overcollateralized loans. For instance, a lender depositing $15,000 in USDT will earn around $2,250 in annual returns through the protocol’s variable rates. In return, they will receive mtTokens — digital receipts that represent their share of the liquidity pool. These mtTokens can later be staked to earn MUTM rewards, multiplying earnings over time. Borrowers, on the other hand, will use crypto collateral to unlock instant liquidity without selling their assets. For example, locking $5,000 worth of ETH will allow borrowing up to $3,750 in stablecoins — a 75% loan-to-value ratio. This feature lets investors access funds while keeping exposure to ETH’s price movement, a strategy favored by active traders managing their tax efficiency and portfolio flexibility. Stability, security, and why whales are moving in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also stands out for its decentralized stablecoin design, which will keep a consistent $1 peg. The stablecoin will be minted when users borrow against collateral and burned once those loans are repaid or liquidated. Governance will adjust borrowing rates dynamically to maintain peg stability. When the stablecoin trades above $1, borrowing costs will decrease to encourage issuance. When it drops below $1, borrowing costs will rise to push the price back toward balance. This smart mechanism creates a stable, self-regulating ecosystem that strengthens user trust. Behind this financial logic lies a strong security foundation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has completed a CertiK audit, scoring 90.00 on TokenScan and 79.00 on Skynet through both static analysis and manual review. The project has also launched a $50,000 bug bounty program that rewards community members up to $2,000 for identifying critical vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, a $100,000 giveaway campaign rewards 10 early participants with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each — driving user engagement while expanding the project’s holder base. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s 12K+ Twitter followers reflect a growing audience eager to join before the presale moves to its next stage. Roadmap and sepolia testnet The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) roadmap shows clear progress. Earlier phases focused on presale, marketing, and audits. The next milestones include full smart contract integration, DApp front-end rollout, and back-end infrastructure. The beta launch will go live, introducing new modules such as liquidity pools, debt tokens, and liquidator bots. These developments will pave the way for a public mainnet launch with institutional partnerships and exchange listings. On top of that, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announced that it is developing a crypto lending and borrowing platform. The first version, V1, is set to launch on the Sepolia testnet in late 2025. It will feature key components such as a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and a liquidator bot to ensure smooth operation. At launch, users will be able to lend, borrow, and use ETH or USDT as collateral securely and efficiently.

Key Takeaways: A crypto whale reopened a $163M Bitcoin short after profiting $192M from a trade before Trump’s tariff announcement. The trader’s timing has raised accusations of insider trading and possibly triggering a weekend liquidation cascade. Binance denied any technical fault during the crash, offering $283M in compensation to users affected. Blockchain data shows that the trader , identified by the address 0xb317 on the decentralized derivatives exchange Hyperliquid, opened a $163 million short position on Bitcoin late Sunday. The new 10x leveraged bet is already up $3.5 million in unrealized profit, though it risks liquidation if Bitcoin climbs to $125,500. ‘Insider Whale’ Accused After $192M Crypto Short Timed Before Trump Tariff News The trader gained notoriety last week after opening a nine-figure short position just 30 minutes before Donald Trump’s tariff announcement, which triggered a market-wide plunge and earned the address nearly $192 million in profit. The timing has sparked accusations of insider trading, with observers calling the entity an “insider whale.” Crypto analyst MLM noted that the trader reportedly shorted additional amounts of BTC and ETH minutes before the crash, suggesting they might have fueled the weekend’s liquidation cascade. “This guy played a huge role in what happened today,” MLM posted. On-chain trackers later revealed that over 250 wallets lost millionaire status on Hyperliquid following the selloff. Not everyone is bearish, however. Another trader reportedly went long $11 million on Bitcoin with 40x leverage, betting on a rebound after the market chaos. Still, the sharp volatility and lack of oversight in decentralized trading have reignited debates about crypto market integrity. “Crypto people are realizing today what it means to have unregulated markets — insider trading, corruption, crime, and zero accountability,” said Janis Kluge, a researcher at SWP Berlin. In case you didn’t know – the BTC whale closed 90% of his BTC short and fully closed his ETH short, making around $190–$200M profit in just one day on Hyperliquid. The crazy part is that he shorted another 9 figs worth of BTC and ETH minutes before the cascade happened. And this… pic.twitter.com/QhmUpesG0j — MLM (@mlmabc) October 10, 2025 Meanwhile, Binance faced fresh scrutiny amid rumors that its systems malfunctioned during the selloff. Several traders reported failed stop-loss orders, token depeggings, and sudden liquidations. Binance responded, denying any technical fault and attributing the event to a “display issue.” “We are aware of speculation in the market regarding the causes of this event,” the exchange stated, confirming that its core futures, spot, and API systems remained operational. Binance later said it would compensate affected users , offering $283 million to those holding depegged collateral assets such as USDE, BNSOL, and WBETH. Trump’s Approval Hits New Lows amid Government Shutdown US President Donald Trump’s approval rating has fallen sharply , with just 40% of Americans approving and 58% disapproving, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. The drop follows growing criticism of his decision to militarize law enforcement. A separate HarrisX survey showed a slightly higher 46% approval, underscoring the deep partisan divide across the country. The decline comes amid an ongoing government shutdown triggered by Congress’s failure to pass spending bills by the October 1 deadline. Trump blamed Democrats, saying he would target their programs in future budget cuts. Meanwhile, on the Polymarket prediction platform, 86% of traders expect the shutdown to continue past October 15, reflecting waning confidence in Washington’s ability to compromise. Trump’s pro-crypto stance, a central theme of his 2024 campaign, is also drawing scrutiny. Senator Elizabeth Warren has warned that Trump’s crypto involvement could pose ethical risks if he profits from related ventures while in office.

Bitcoin and Ether have both recovered back to the middle of their range-bound channels, but some of the AI-related altcoins are surging. AI-focused crypto token Bittensor (TAO) has pumped a whopping 35%, topping $410 in an eleven-week high on Monday morning. However, the native token for the decentralized machine learning network remains down 46% from its all-time high. Another AI token, ChainOpera AI (COAI), has skyrocketed a whopping 70% to an all-time high of $43.80 on Sunday. Decentralized GPU compute platform Render (RNDR) has gained 17% on the day to reach $2.80 during Monday morning trading in Asia. Altcoins Leading the Recovery DeFi platform Mantle (MNT) has also surged today, with a 27% move to reclaim $2.20, recovering all losses from the weekend rout. The Trump family DeFi platform (WLFI) is on the rise as well, with an 18% gain on the day to reach $14.30 at the time of writing. Binance’s tokens, BNB and ASTER, were both performing well, gaining 14% apiece. The Binance exchange was implicated during the big crash as its market maker froze and a number of tokens depegged, leading to mass liquidations. The firm issued a statement on Sunday that this happened before the selloff but offered compensation to traders who held USDE, BNSOL, and WBETH as collateral. ETH had made more than 8%, reclaiming $4,200, XRP jumped by 9% to $2.57, and Solana was up 8% at $195. Meanwhile, Dogecoin, Chainlink, and Sui were all in double-figure gains as altcoins led the market recovery today. In the future, we’ll look back at this wick and see it as a bump before new highs.

The last time altcoins dumped so hard was the March 2020 COVID meltdown, and a massive altseason followed in 2021. “The fact that Bitcoin held above $115K after that kind of stress is a testament to the asset’s structural strength,” he added. BTC recovered 5% from its sub-$110,000 dip and was trading at $115,300 at the time of writing.

This index, which measures the market sentiment and shows on a scale how investors are feeling about the crypto market, has now fallen back into the Extreme Fear territory. The number on the scale now shows the lowest level it has been since the market crash back in April 2025. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Sees Major Crash The Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index uses a number of factors to determine how investors are feeling about the market. It takes into account things like volatility, social sentiment aggregated across different social media platforms, market volume and momentum, and market dominance to come to a figure. Related Reading: Crypto Crash: $19.5 Billion Wiped Out In Record-Breaking Liquidation Event The data is aggregated, which puts it on a scale of 1-100, with 1-25 being Extreme Fear, 26-46 being Fear, 47-54 being Neutral, 55-75 representing Greed, and 76-100 representing Extreme Greed. Each of these shows either bullishness, bearishness, or nonchalance in the market. The most recent data shows that the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index crashed to 24 on Sunday. This puts the index firmly in Extreme Fear territory, suggesting that investors are extremely cautious at this point. It also shows a reluctance to enter into any positions at this time. This is the result of the massive liquidation event that happened last Friday, with crypto traders losing over $19 billion in one day. Thus, it is no surprise that fear has gripped the market. However, this would also present a unique opportunity in the market. Buy When The Market Is Bleeding One of the oldest sayings in the financial world is to “buy when there is blood on the streets.” This represents times of extreme losses, where most investors are scared to put their money in the market. Thus, with the market teetering on Extreme Fear, it could be the time to buy. Related Reading: XRP’s 2017 Pattern Returns In 2025, Analyst Predicts Massive Rally The last time that the market declined into Extreme Fear this low was back in April 2025, and what followed was a rally that saw the Bitcoin price reach new all-time highs in May 2025. If this trend holds, then the market could be looking at a possible rapid increase. By Sunday, the market was already recovering, with the Bitcoin price crossing $114,000 and Ethereum making its way back above $4,000. It is still quite early to tell if the market is in a full recovery trend, but with prices already bouncing, it could signal the next wave of gains.

Avalon X is in the presale stage right now, and many are calling it a possible 100× crypto coin for 2025. Cardano, Stellar, and Ripple have already seen a huge rise and have the potential to rise even more. These numbers show why these projects are some of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in for the best returns in 2025. Avalon X (AVLX): The Next Big Crypto in 2025 That Could Deliver 100× Returns The spotlight right now is firmly on Avalon X crypto, an ambitious project redefining real estate tokenization crypto. Having just progressed to Stage 2, where the token price is set at $0.01. Stage 1 was completed successfully, yielding a 100% return on investment for early participants with more than 43 million tokens sold in that stage. Early investors are positioning themselves for what could be the next big crypto in 2025. With analysts calling it a potential 100× crypto coin for 2025, Avalon X is stirring major excitement. Every early-stage investor dreams of finding that one golden ticket before it takes off, and Avalon X could be that ticket. Avalon X is a real estate backed cryptocurrency. This means that investors can invest in real estate crypto assets that have real-world value while still trading them online. The total supply is limited to 2 billion tokens, and 60% of those will go to presale distribution. As tokens sell out fast, more investors are racing to secure their allocation before prices rise in the next stage. And if that wasn’t enough to grab your attention, Avalon X is turning up the heat with one of the most generous early adoption campaigns the crypto market has ever seen. Avalon X is running an unprecedented $1M crypto giveaway , one of the biggest in 2025. The Avalon X giveaway includes 10 lucky winners, each receiving $100,000 worth of AVLX tokens, plus an exclusive crypto townhouse giveaway in the luxurious gated Eco Avalon development. Investors don’t just want in; they want in right now. Eco Avalon Townhouse Giveaway Avalon X is adding to the excitement with the referral program running alongside the giveaways, offering participants 10 bonus entries for each successful referral along with an additional 10% in tokens. The program creates a fun and rewarding opportunity for the community to engage more deeply and increase their chances of winning. Avalon X has passed a full security audit by CertiK , which adds to its credibility and shows that safety and transparency are its top priorities. The roadmap also shows that there will be future listings on major tier-1 CEXs like Binance and Uniswap. This sets the stage for a potentially explosive debut when trading starts publicly. Avalon X is more than just a token; it’s a link between investing in crypto backed by real world assets and traditional investing. With these features, Avalon X seems to be the best crypto to buy in 2025. Ripple (XRP): A Veteran Contender with Renewed Momentum The XRP price is at $2.73 and has posted a stunning +450% rally over the past year. Despite facing resistance zones, XRP maintains high liquidity and growing institutional support. Source: TradingView Recent XRP news suggests that clearer rules in the US have made investors more confident and excited about the market again. Experts think that XRP’s next breakout could take it to higher levels once it clearly breaks out of its consolidation phase. Stellar (XLM): Technical Breakout on the Horizon Stellar (XLM) has been strong even though it has faced short-term resistance at $0.369. Technical analysts are keeping a close eye on a possible double-bottom formation, which is a bullish pattern that could start the next leg up. Source: TradingView If XLM sustains movement above its key Fibonacci level at $0.375, a continuation toward past highs becomes increasingly likely. Its consistent performance makes it a solid option for investors. Cardano (ADA): Strong Structure, Big Price Forecasts Cardano (ADA) is at around $0.782, maintaining a strong position above long-term moving averages. Source: TrDadingView Analysts forecast a Cardano price range between $0.66 and $1.88 for 2025, with Cardano price prediction reaching as high as $2.36 upon confirmed breakout momentum. Cardano may present far higher growth potential given its momentum and potential. Avalon X Offers The Best Return With a low entry price, real estate backing, and its Avalon X $1M prize campaign, AVLX is fast becoming the most talked-about project in crypto circles. Early buyers are positioning themselves for what could be the biggest ROI play of the year. Don’t wait until the headlines read ‘Avalon X Hits Binance’ to realize what you missed, the smartest investors are already positioning early. Now is the best time to act.

Speaking in an interview shared on X by Crypto influencer Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), Long reflected on the changing attitudes of major financial institutions, describing what appears to be a decisive turn in sentiment after years of uncertainty. “It feels like the floodgates are going to open this year,” she said, referencing renewed interest from global banks that had previously held back due to regulatory hesitation. According to Long, institutions such as Bank of America, one of Ripple’s early partners during its initial payment solution phase, are now showing a marked increase in enthusiasm for XRP adoption. BREAKING: Monica Long reveals Bank of America CEO says ""We're all in on $XRP Once BlackRock announces the XRP ETF, the flood gates are about to burst… #Crypto #CryptoCommunity pic.twitter.com/ppC3DsbRmi — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) October 12, 2025 Changing Tone from Major Banks Long described a notable shift in the approach of banking executives, particularly in the wake of recent U.S. regulatory and political developments. She recalled that in the past, many institutions were discouraged by what she described as a lack of clarity and, at times, hostility toward using digital assets like XRP. This, she noted, created a difficult environment for innovation and collaboration. Her comments suggested that this period of hesitation is now giving way to renewed momentum. She stated, “You hear from CEOs like Bank of America saying, we’re all in,” revealing the return of institutional confidence to XRP and the broader crypto market, particularly among banks that have maintained relationships with Ripple . Optimism and Policy Shifts Long also linked the change in tone to the U.S. presidential election, noting that conversations with banks on partnerships in reserve banking and transaction services for Ripple’s stablecoin and payments operations have changed significantly. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 She explained that the shift occurred “overnight” after the election narrative began influencing expectations about financial policy and regulatory direction. This optimism aligns with growing speculation within the digital asset space that 2025 is a turning point for institutional adoption . Xaif, who shared the interview, remarked that once BlackRock announces its XRP exchange-traded fund (ETF) , it could trigger a surge in institutional participation, an expectation widely echoed across the crypto community, though not confirmed by either company. Renewed Confidence in Digital Assets Long’s remarks suggest that Ripple sees a clear path forward for deeper collaboration between financial institutions and blockchain technology providers. With longstanding partners reportedly re-engaging in discussions about payments and stablecoin infrastructure, XRP’s position as a bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-based systems appears to be strengthening.

Meanwhile, experts and analysts likely spent the weekend exploring what triggered the largest flash crash in the asset class’s history. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid founder Jeff has joined those attacking Binance for its role in the massive October 10 slide. Jeff took it to X to publicly accuse Binance of hiding the scale of liquidation, warning that centralized exchanges are undermining the integrity of the whole cryptocurrency industry. jeff.hl @chameleon_jeff · Follow Hyperliquid’s fully onchain liquidations cannot be compared with underreported CEX liquidationsHyperliquid is a blockchain where every order, trade, and liquidation happens onchain. Anyone can permissionlessly verify the chain’s execution, including all liquidations and their 6:34 AM · Oct 13, 2025 404 Reply Copy link Read 100 replies He believes Binance’s reporting approach could mean 100x underreporting during intensified trading periods. Indeed, markets suffer enormous liquidations during wild swings. Thus, closing multiple positions in a second and only recording one can paint a distorted picture of the market for analysts and traders. According to Jeff, such narratives undermine trust in a sector that thrives on neutrality and transparency. He said: On Binance, even if there are thousands of liquidation orders in the same second, only one is reported. Because liquidations happen in bursts, this could easily be 100x underreporting under some conditions. These claims come as the cryptocurrency community debates whether they can trust data from top exchanges, especially when billions vanish during sudden dips. Some believe Binance manipulated the market, and it’s responsible for the current market weakness. Others are questioning why the native token BNB remained stable amid relentless dips. Decentralized exchanges are experiencing optimism as industry players rally against CEXs. Hyperliquid’s coin HYPE has rebounded from $36 to $40 over the previous day, an 11% jump. It has cooled to $38 at press time, with dwindling trading volumes signaling prevailing weakness. Chart by Coinmarketcap Nevertheless, caution remains paramount as the ongoing market revival could be a dead cat bounce. Hyperliquid’s transparency model Jeff highlighted how Hyperliquid differs from CEX. Unlike traditional exchanges, the DEX runs fully on-chain. All liquidations, orders, and trades happen on the blockchain, allowing anyone to view them anytime. With such a mode, users can verify individual transactions and the fairness and solvency of the whole market in real time. The founder anticipates an industry that prioritizes fairness, openness, and verifiability as digital assets integrate with the global financial sector. Hopefully, the industry will see transparency and neutrality as important features of the new financial system, and others will follow. A glimpse of the latest crypto crash: what happened? While headlines attributed the massive dips to Trump’s 100% tariffs on China , analysts emphasize that Binance was the real perpetrator. They discovered that a recognized market maker sent $700 million to Binance hours before the bloodbath. Meanwhile, the exchange’s order books started hollowing out, with zero bids, no depth, and no walls. That created a setup for free falls. Notably, BTC’s 1-minute candlesticks revealed massive Bitcoin dumps within minutes. Nonetheless, liquidation pressure surged to terminal velocity when Bitcoin crashed to $108,000. Reports suggest Binance’s market maker withdrew liquidity and stopped defending price declines. That catalyzed the market slump that unexpectedly vaporized billions. Binance has offered $283 million to compensate victims of forced liquidation in the latest flash crash.

This move, coupled with new export controls on software, has sparked the largest crypto liquidation in history. Over $19 billion in leveraged positions vanished within 24 hours, impacting 1.6 million traders. From above $125,000 to below $113,000, Bitcoin fell 12% and Ethereum and Solana also had significant losses. As a result, concerns about a trade war between the US and China have affected oil and equities, forcing investors to reevaluate risks in the face of increased volatility. The best cryptocurrency to buy during the current chaos shines brightly for anyone looking for stability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) distinguishes itself by providing loan and borrowing services that mitigate the impact of the cryptocurrency meltdown. Bitcoin faces steep liquidation pressure Traders have watched Bitcoin lead the liquidation charge. Long positions evaporated to the tune of $5.34 billion as the asset slid sharply. This drop reflects broader market jitters from tariff shocks. Ethereum has also absorbed $4.39 billion in losses amid the frenzy. Borrowers scrambled as prices dipped, triggering automated sales. In addition, the network’s high fees compound recovery challenges post-crash. Thus, while Ethereum powers DeFi, its exposure to the same crypto price volatility undermines quick rebounds. As a result, it falls short as the top crypto to invest in for those eyeing resilient gains. In addition, Solana contributed $2 billion to the wipeout tally. Faster transactions failed to shield it from the tariff-induced panic. Moreover, altcoin correlations pulled it down alongside majors. However, liquidity constraints in stressed times reveal Solana’s limits. Therefore, it lags as a top crypto to invest in when crypto crashes, as demand for proven utility is lacking. Mutuum Finance presale accelerates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has drawn keen interest despite the crypto crash. The presale now enters phase 6 of 11 phases, with 65% filled rapidly. Investors have raised $17,250,000 since the start, and the total MUTM holders number 16,910. Current buyers secure tokens at $0.035, a 250% rise from the phase 1 price of $0.01. Phase 6 sells out fast, so opportunities at this level dwindle. Soon, phase 7 opens with a 14.3% hike to $0.04. At launch, MUTM reached $0.06, promising current holders a 420% ROI. Furthermore, this structure rewards early crypto investment in a protocol built for endurance. Mutuum builds lending protocol The team has announced its lending and borrowing protocol development. Version 1 deploys to Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025. Core elements include liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and liquidator bots. Initial assets cover ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, or collateral. In addition, overcollateralization ensures safety, while borrow caps limit risks. Thus, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) addresses why crypto is down by fostering stable yields. Consequently, it positions itself as the top crypto to invest in for long-term crypto investing. Mutuum hosts major giveaway As Mutuum Finance (MUTM) announces its biggest giveaway, anticipation is growing. Ten winners get $100,000 in MUTM tokens from the tournament, with each winner receiving $10,000. For safe transactions, participants provide their wallet addresses. They complete quests to boost odds and confirm eligibility with a minimum $50 presale investment. Furthermore, this initiative highlights community focus. As crypto prices today fluctuate, it underscores Mutuum’s appeal in crypto investing. Navigating the wipeout with smart picks Tariff increases are the cause of today’s $19 billion cryptocurrency fall, but there are still chances. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana have collapsed under strain, showing disparities in resiliency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, prospers solidly. This is due to its emphasis on security, presale momentum, and protocol usefulness. Thus, it reaffirms itself as the top crypto to invest in. Explore Mutuum Finance (MUTM) now to secure your stake before phase 6 closes.

One of them, Jang Seong-ho, is utilizing a 6 billion won ($4.3 million) investment from Altos Ventures to develop an AI-driven filmmaking system at his studio, Mofac, which is built on Unreal Engine. With AI, Jang anticipates streamlined workflows and lower costs, enabling Mofac to produce a full-length film and a series annually. He commented, “With a powerful leader holding AI as a tool, the work that once required hundreds of people could soon be done by just one or two.” South Korean filmmakers have lined up AI projects During the 2020 pandemic, film production was halted, thwarting many filmmakers’ dreams. But for Jang Seong-ho, it helped to give birth to something new. At the time, his South Korean visual effects (VFX) and animation studio was a small operation barely holding together King of Kings, its animated adaptation of Dickens’ The Life of Our Lord, until Hollywood actors Kenneth Branagh, Oscar Isaac, and Uma Thurman joined the project. King of Kings, released stateside around Easter, broke a new U.S. record for South Korean cinema and surpassed the Oscar-winning Parasite’s success. So far, the film has earned $60 million in the U.S. and is on track to top $100 million globally by Christmas — an impressive feat for a production that cost just $25 million, a fraction of Hollywood’s usual budget. The film has already given Mofac recognition, and its plans for AI integration may solidify that standing even more. Mofac is not the only Korean studio venturing into AI. Pencil is reviving A Better Tomorrow in an AI-assisted animated remake. Moreover, Galaxy Corp., known for managing Song Kang-ho and G-Dragon, is developing AI-powered virtual characters with SKAI Intelligence and Nvidia’s Omniverse. Hive Media Corp., the producer of 12.12: The Day, also joins a growing list of Korean film studios eager to use AI for both animation and live-action work. Some companies have already actualized some of their AI projects. Earlier this year, Inshorts, an AI company, utilized its Super-Scaler technology to restore and remaster the film Leafie, a Hen into the Wild, in 4K. At that time, the company’s founder had claimed that integrating AI into the remastering process halved costs and greatly accelerated the work. December 2024 also saw the premiere of bold cinematic experiments featuring generative AI in theaters. It’s Me, Mun–hee and M Hotel saw their big screen debut, with the latter winning awards at both the Busan International Artificial Intelligence Film Festival and Venice’s Reply AI Film Festival. Park Chan-wook voiced fears that AI tools may jeopardize employment After founding Sora in early 2024, OpenAI started courting Hollywood. Leaders of the company, including Sam Altman, its chief executive officer, went to Los Angeles for a series of events and meetings with Hollywood executives. They held meetings with film companies, media executives, and talent agencies to showcase the technology; however, these meetings have not yet yielded any deals. Hollywood is still debating how to incorporate AI into the film industry, particularly with the introduction of OpenAI’s Sora . The artificial intelligence research and deployment company has spent months discussing Sora’s creative and business potential with Disney, Universal, and Warner Bros. Still, some filmmakers are concerned that they won’t be able to protect their IP. Attorney Aaron Moss commented, “Hollywood now faces a stark choice: Take action to protect its IP or wake up to find its most valuable properties circulating as AI-generated slop across social media.” Some film studios have gone so far as to file lawsuits in an effort to prove that AI apps are producing lookalike versions of their characters. Disney has already taken the first step, suing Midjourney to establish a precedent. Still, that hasn’t stopped Asian filmmakers from quickly adopting technologies like OpenAI’s Sora and Kuaishou’s Kling AI, which are capable of generating ultra-realistic videos in a matter of seconds. However, top directors are still concerned that AI could replace jobs and alter the artistic language of film. Park Chan-wook, known for Old Boy and No Other Choice, noted, “It could also take away many jobs and fundamentally alter the aesthetics of cinema.

CEO Nischal Shetty said Monday that the Singapore High Court has approved the scheme, paving the way for the exchange to move ahead with its rehabilitation efforts. Shetty did not disclose additional details about the approved plan, and a WazirX spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. However, the approval marks a turning point for the embattled platform, which has spent over a year navigating a complex restructuring process to restore user balances and resume full operations. Thank you to everyone who supported this difficult phase of WazirX. The Singapore High Court has approved the scheme. Its your support and love that has made this possible Now we set out on the next phase to work hard and create value for everyone. We’re here because of YOU… — Nischal (Shardeum) (@NischalShetty) October 13, 2025 Singapore Court Approval Caps Months Of Negotiations And Plan Revisions The court’s decision follows months of creditor engagement and revisions to the company’s original proposal. In August, more than 95% of WazirX’s creditors voted in favour of the updated scheme , filed by its Singapore-based parent company, Zettai Pte Ltd. The vote accounted for about $206.9m in validated claims from more than 149,000 account holders. Under the restructuring plan, WazirX aims to redistribute the remaining assets fairly, in line with Singapore’s Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act of 2018. To achieve this, the exchange chose a court-supervised Scheme of Arrangement instead of liquidation. This approach helped avoid years of delays — liquidation could have postponed recoveries until 2030 or later. Now that the court has approved the plan, WazirX can begin returning assets and gradually reopening trading services. According to company filings, the first round of token distributions will begin within 10 business days of the scheme taking effect. If all goes as expected, users could recover about 85% of their account balances, based on valuations from the date of the hack. Revised Scheme Clears Hurdles With Over 95% Creditor Approval The road to approval was not smooth. Initially, in March, more than 93% of creditors backed WazirX’s restructuring plan. However, in June, the Singapore High Court rejected the proposal due to regulatory concerns over token distributions. In response, WazirX revised the plan. The new version routed repayments through its Indian entity, Zanmai Labs, which is registered with the country’s Financial Intelligence Unit. As a result, the updated proposal gained even stronger support in the second vote, held between July 30 and Aug. 6. The process, coordinated by Kroll Issuer Services, was limited to users who held positive account balances as of July 18, 2024. Encouragingly, the high level of participation reflected renewed confidence in WazirX’s recovery plan after months of uncertainty. Meanwhile, Zettai Pte Ltd, acquired by Binance in 2019, played a pivotal role throughout the restructuring. The Singapore entity retained custody of WazirX’s crypto assets and liabilities, while Zanmai Labs continued to oversee fiat operations in India. WazirX Eyes Swift Return Of Trading And Withdrawals Post-Approval Following the hack , Zettai sought a moratorium from the Singapore High Court. The goal was to protect against global creditor actions and prevent assets from being split across jurisdictions. With the moratorium in place, WazirX was able to consolidate its restructuring under Singapore law. This ensured that both Indian and international users would be treated uniformly. Moreover, it reduced the risk of conflicting legal claims — a key issue after several Indian users questioned the applicability of WazirX’s terms of service. The hacking incident had caused heavy losses and frozen withdrawals, pushing the exchange close to insolvency.

53073921,604635,1760340533,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53073921.jpeg,Grok’s Dogecoin Price Prediction After $19B Market Crash: Maxi Doge Raises $3.5M,https://bitcoinist.com/grok-dogecoin-price-prediction-after-market-crash-as-maxi-doge-raises-3-5m/,"Quick Facts: 1⃣ Dogecoin rebounded strongly after Trump’s tariff announcement, holding above its key long-term support line. 2⃣ Grok’s Dogecoin price prediction projects a potential 500% upside, targeting around $1.30. 3⃣ Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is neatly positioned as the top meme coin to ride Dogecoin’s next rally. Although Dogecoin plummeted nearly 60% on Friday after Donald Trump rocked crypto’s boat by announcing a new 100% tariff on China , the token was quick to snap back and regain much of the losses, closing the day down just 22% . Most importantly, the daily candle closed above the upward-sloping trend line that has been supporting the token since August of last year. Most recently, this same support line sparked a 100% rally in June-July 2025. Now that $DOGE has completed its support test this weekend, we decided to call in the big guns of AI to dig deep for this Dogecoin price prediction. Grok’s Dogecoin Price Prediction Points to a Massive 500% Upside For our analysis, we turned to Grok, one of the most powerful AI chatbots with real-time access to X, encompassing everything from real-time market updates to analyst remarks and online sentiment. Grok zoomed out on the charts and pointed to a neat breakout from a descending triangle. As you can see, $DOGE broke out of this consolidation zone in early September, and it was quick to retest the resistance line it had broken – precisely what we’d want to see after such a critical breakout. While Friday’s dump shook things up a bit, the token is now once again challenging the upper resistance line of the triangle pattern. As for a potential target, Grok measured the width of this triangle pattern and mapped it onto the expected breakout level of around $0.22. This gives us a potential target of around $1.30 – a massive 500% upside from current price levels. That said, the AI cautioned that $DOGE will have to grapple with its all-time high of $0.79 on its way upward to this target. Although Dogecoin’s 500% potential upside is nothing to sniff at, OG crypto investors know that’s just peanuts compared to what Dogecoin truly can – and has – delivered in the past. For instance, in 2017, when the token first rose to fame, it skyrocketed by an eye-popping 10,000% in just over a month. Then, in 2021, it backed that performance by delivering another 30,000% rally in a similarly short span of time. Here’s the kicker now : although Dogecoin’s maturity over the years has slashed the percentage gains on offer, it’s still the meme coin king. This means a Dogecoin rally could very well ignite a broader meme coin boom. And Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is arguably the best crypto to buy now if you want to fully capitalize on Dogecoin’s momentum. ‎ Understanding Maxi Doge’s Connection to Dogecoin What is Maxi Doge , you ask? Well, don’t mistake it for another overly ambitious new cryptocurrency project trying to associate itself with Dogecoin in hopes of outsized returns. Dogecoin’s distant cousin, Maxi Doge, is a breed apart. While Dogecoin hogged the limelight at every family gathering, Maxi sulked in a corner and dreamed up his revenge. He then took to the gym and channeled that envy to become the ultimate Doge nemesis — and now stands as a potential 1000x crypto opportunity for savvy investors. $MAXI’s Master Plan Is to Go Viral Of course, Maxi Doge’s mission to overthrow Dogecoin as the best meme coin on the planet is an uphill task. But Maxi has already taken the first steps toward this ambitious goal by crafting the perfect tokenomics. The developers have reserved a massive 40% of the total token supply for marketing. This allocation will fund high-ticket influencer collaborations, social media campaigns, and PR initiatives designed to promote $MAXI across the cryptocurrency landscape, enhancing both its visibility and hype. Additionally, $MAXI aims to create a thriving community. To achieve this, it’s offering exclusive holder-only trading events that will take place weekly, along with leaderboard rewards to engage and reward loyal investors. What’s more, the token doesn’t want to limit itself to CEX and DEX listings. It also plans to launch on futures platforms, further increasing its usability, particularly among meme coin traders who will be able to use $MAXI for high-leverage trading. Why You Shouldn’t Delay Your $MAXI Purchase Maxi Doge ($MAXI) is currently in presale, having already raised over $3.56M from early investors. Today, 1 $MAXI is available for just $0.0002625. Most importantly, institutional players are backing Maxi Doge to become the next crypto to explode . For instance, just this Saturday, two whales scooped up a total of $627K worth of $MAXI ( $314K & $313K ), so there’s no shortage of investor confidence in the project. Need help with the purchase process? Here’s our step-by-step guide on how to buy $MAXI . According to our Maxi Doge price prediction , the token could soar to $0.0024 by the end of 2025, delivering a chunky 814% return. Furthermore, if you exercise a little patience and hold on to Maxi Doge longer, it could generate over 2,100% ROI by the end of 2026, with the token projected to hit $0.0058. These life-changing gains could be yours only if you grab your $MAXI tokens now – while it’s still in presale and available at some of its lowest-ever prices. Back the new ‘Doge’ on the blockchain – buy $MAXI today. Disclaimer : Kindly do your own research before investing in crypto.

With the maturing market, investors are searching for projects that have good fundamentals and enormous growth potential. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been a project that has been gaining momentum. In Phase 6 of its presale, out of the 170 million tokens in this phase that have been earmarked, over 65% have been sold to date. Mutuum Finance has been able to raise over $17.25 million. As the presale gathers momentum, the value of the token will further increase, and Phase 7 will be worth $0.04, a near 15% appreciation from the current rate of $0.035. With its revolutionary approach and astounding presale performance, Mutuum Finance has emerged as a likely alternative among investors who are looking for a future blockbuster in the world of cryptocurrencies. Dogecoin market update: Watching key levels Dogecoin (DOGE) has been shaky and recently lost the $0.25 level to hit $0.19. If it holds to that level, DOGE may continue its gradual ascent, but a fall below $0.17 may induce a pullback to $0.10, testing investor patience. Otherwise, a breakout to $0.29 or higher can usher in renewed full-blown meme season, sending DOGE higher along with renewed euphoria. While traders carefully mark these key levels, many are looking to the upcoming altcoin in good form and fundamentals, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), as a potential opportunity outside the realm of meme tokens. Mutuum Finance presale frenzy continues onward Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is the newest sensation in the DeFi sector, whose investor demand for the presale just seems to build momentum day by day. Existing presale stands at Phase 6, worth $0.035 per coin of MUTM, and has managed to achieve a value of over $17.25 million as a result of funding from over 16,910 investors. With over 65% sales during Phase 6, there is quite a small time for the investors to put their money into, reflecting the skyrocketing global confidence for the future prospects of the project as well as the decentralized finance potential. The pioneer investors will have tremendous potential profit when MUTM is launched into the open market. It will also launch an Ethereum blockchain-secured stablecoin that will be pegged to the USD. It is not an algorithmic coin that declines throughout the duration of the bear market, but over-collateralised and non-algorithmic, such that in the days of fluctuating markets, the token will be stable as well as dependable. Borrowing and lending protocol The platform will launch its next-gen lending and borrowing protocol , one of the most important releases for its DeFi platform. Version 1 will be rolled out on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and will include liquidity pools, mtTokens, and debt tokens, alongside a liquidator bot. The first digital currencies that will be covered for lending/borrowing, alongside collateralization, will be ETH and USDT and will provide users with a secure, user-friendly, alongside multi-asset DeFi experience. As Dogecoin (DOGE) heads towards $0.24, the majority of investors are now looking to other projects that have better fundamentals and growth prospects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already managed to collect more than $17.25 million from more than 16,910 investors in Phase 6 of its sale, and it has already sold 65% of tokens. Phase 7 will be triggered when it gets to $0.04. With its upcoming Sepolia Testnet lending and borrowing, liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and stablecoin support, MUTM has become a next-gen DeFi platform to be used for the long term. Potential investors looking for the next high-growth altcoin have to do it now to own Mutuum Finance tokens and become a member of this fast-growing ecosystem.

Traders were left reeling as leveraged bets throughout ETH, BTC, and other key altcoins were liquidated in a matter of a few minutes, stoking panic and a sell-off tsunami. ETH was severely hit in isolation, slumping more than 13% in a single day as sentiment became intensely bearish. In the midst of volatility, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shines as a beacon of security and potentiality. Now in Phase 6 of its presale, having sold out more than 65% already, Mutuum Finance integrates a DeFi ecosystem thoughtfully designed, coupled with strong community support and a clear roadmap towards sustainable growth. While volatile fluctuations are reminiscent of other large coins like ETH, Mutuum Finance presents investors the opportunity to invest early in a token designed for utility, innovativeness, and long-term adoption, turning out to be among the best altcoins to invest in as the market struggles to rebound. Ethereum Price Forecast: ETH Back to Significant Support During Trading Volatility Ethereum (ETH) has decreased approximately 11%, falling below $4,000 in the midst of continued market volatility, but this correction remains no cause to panic. The asset is retesting a significant demand level, earlier resistance, now functioning as crucial support near $3,600, and $3,200 as a possible floor if larger macro trends further deteriorate. A reclamation of $4,200 would indicate a return to higher-timeframe optimism. On a near-term basis, stochastic volatility and optionality are king, and staking flows and ETF speculation are likely to have a larger impact than headlines. Broadly speaking, the uptrend remains, and ETH staying above this demand level may be the beginning of its next great run, a note that as the market retests key levels, forward-thinking investors are looking to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for portfolio diversification and possible gain. Rise of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) As we are in presale phase 6, a single MUTM token costs $0.035. Investor interest has yet to subside, as more than 16,910 investors are investing in the project to surpass $17.25 million. This kind of strong demand indicates further faith in the future prospects of a presale as well as the future prospects instilled in the company product, a decentralized finance product. The protocol obtains maximum efficiency of collateral by precisely calculated Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio, virtually on undercollateralized loans. There is also shock buffer reserve set aside for market shock, and surer reserves are invested judiciously on risk-free holdings. The architecture provides shock-absorption ability without compromise on the overall health of the system with stable, strong, and sustainable DeFi platform. Borrowing and Lending Protocol Updated Version Mutuum Finance is building a futuristic lending and borrowing protocol . Sepolia Testnet will launch its first version in Q4 2025. The product will feature liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, liquidator bot, etc. both ETH and USDT will be able to be collateral for borrowing/lending and provide DeFi users with a fast, high-speed, and user-friendly DeFi experience. Mutuum Finance has also launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program together with CertiK. It rewards white-hat hackers and security researchers who identify bugs in the codebase and report to it. Mutuum Finance Shines Through Ethereum Volatility Ethereum (ETH) dropped below $4,000 amid $19B in crypto liquidations, rattling the market. While ETH faces sharp swings, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains strong, with Phase 6 over 65% sold, $17.25M raised, and 16,910+ investors onboard. Its dual-lending DeFi model, precise Loan-to-Value ratios, and shock buffer reserves provide stability and long-term growth potential. With the upcoming lending and borrowing protocol on Sepolia Testnet Q4 2025, MUTM offers a secure, efficient, and user-friendly DeFi experience. Investors seeking a resilient altcoin should join the Mutuum Finance presale now before Phase 6 closes.

53073982,604599,1760340607,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53073982.jpeg,Bitcoin Core v30 Goes Live Despite OP_RETURN Debate,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-core-v30-goes-live-op_return-debate/,"Bitcoin Core version 30.0 is now available, marking the project’s first major release since v29 and closing the book on legacy branches 27.x and older, which are now designated “End of Life.” The maintainers’ release notes state plainly: “With the release of this new major version, versions 27.x and older are at ‘End of Life’ and will no longer receive updates.” The new binaries and full notes are live on the project site, with the team also posting a brief launch confirmation on X. Bitcoin Core V30 Is Here The most disputed change in v30 is a policy update around OP_RETURN—the script path used for provably unspendable outputs that can carry arbitrary data. Bitcoin Core has raised the default -datacarriersize limit to 100,000 bytes and now permits multiple data-carrier (OP_RETURN) outputs in a single transaction for relay and mining. Crucially, node operators can still restore the previous behavior: “It can be overridden with -datacarriersize=83 to revert to the limit enforced in previous versions.” The aggregate size limit applies across all OP_RETURN outputs in a transaction. That default increase—functionally “uncapping” data carrier size because the transaction-size ceiling will be encountered first—has kicked off a broader argument about what kinds of activity Bitcoin’s policy layer should favor or discourage. Developers and node operators who back the change frame it as neutral plumbing that preserves operator choice; critics warn it invites more non-monetary inscriptions and potential spam , raising storage and validation burdens for the average node. Beyond OP_RETURN, v30 delivers a long list of network, wallet, and tooling updates. The P2P layer improves package relay so that common topologies like grandparent-parent-child or multi-parent-one-child can propagate more reliably when only one ancestor needs fee bumping. The transaction orphanage introduces stronger DoS limits based on total entries and weight across peers, replacing the now-retired -maxorphantx knob. Miners gain an experimental IPC mining interface accessible through a new umbrella bitcoin command that also provides convenience aliases—“bitcoin node,” “bitcoin gui,” and “bitcoin rpc”—without deprecating existing binaries. External signing on Windows is re-enabled, and the coinstats index has been reworked to avoid an overflow bug seen on default Signet, requiring a one-time resync of that index. Fee-policy defaults also shift. The minimum block feerate setting (-blockmintxfee) now defaults to 0.001 sat/vB, while both the minimum relay and incremental relay feerates default to 0.1 sat/vB. The notes stress that unless these lower defaults are broadly adopted, propagation and confirmation are not guaranteed; wallet feerates themselves are unchanged without explicit configuration. The OP_RETURN policy change has quickly spilled beyond developer channels into Bitcoin’s public discourse, with long-time contributors and publication editors lining up on both sides. While Bitcoin Core 30.0’s larger data-carrier default and allowance for multiple OP_RETURN outputs are viewed by proponents as policy neutral and adjustable at the node level; detractors see a vector for abuse that blurs the network’s monetary focus which could even spark a hard fork .

53075130,https://invezz.com/?p=2921398,1760340713,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Why MUTM is the crypto to buy as BTC crashes 8% to $112K,https://invezz.com/news/2025/10/13/why-mutm-is-the-crypto-to-buy-as-btc-crashes-8-to-112k/,"Bitcoin has fallen 8% to $112,277 over the past day; traders are now watching an important support level of $110,000. This precipitous decline is due to President Donald Trump’s announcement of 100% tariffs on Chinese goods, causing fears of a trade war and sending investors away from risky assets. As a result, the entire crypto market has lost 9.8% of its value, which has reduced the total value to $3.74 trillion. Ethereum lost 13.4% to $3,785, XRP and Solana lost 14.7% and 17.7%. Moreover, the crypto fear and greed index has fallen to 35, indicating that there is widespread fear. Yet, in the midst of this crypto crash, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting consistent interest as the crypto to buy now, as its presale progresses and real utility develops. Furthermore, on-chain data shows little selling from big holders, implying strength in the turmoil. Thus, this moment highlights the importance of why savvy investors look to projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for stability. Bitcoin’s sudden plunge President Trump announced the tariffs yesterday, and the markets reacted instantly with a risk-off mood. Bitcoin fell from its peaks, touching $112,277 with a strong US dollar. In addition, Ethereum fell even lower to its lowest point in more than a month, down 13.4% amidst the general panic. Solana and XRP were even harder hit with losses of 17.7% and 14.7%, respectively, and both BNB and Cardano lost more than 13%. Dogecoin crashed by more than 20% in a matter of hours. Consequently, we see that the price of cryptocurrencies today has a high level of volatility, with the fear and greed index at its lowest point during the summer. Analysts point out that often such shocks are followed by rebounds when the uncertainty dissipates. However, short-term pressures continue as the fear of supply chain amplifies the downturn. Therefore, Bitcoin tests $110,000 support, but long-term holders give no indication of panic sales. Mutuum Finance’s presale momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $17,250,000 since the presale began, and total MUTM holders now stand at 16,910. Phase 6 of 11 phases is underway, 65% filled at $0.035 per token. This price marks a 250% rise from the phase one level of $0.01. Consequently, phase 6 sells out fast, so chances to buy at this rate fade quickly. Afterwards, phase 7 opens with a 14.3% jump to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launches at $0.06, offering current buyers a 420% ROI post-launch. Furthermore, the team has announced its lending and borrowing protocol development. V1 deploys to Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025, featuring a liquidity pool, mtToken, debt token, and liquidator bot. Initial assets include ETH and USDT for lending, borrowing, and collateral. Thus, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) builds real utility in the DeFi space. Mutuum Finance’s security advances The team has finalized its Certik audit successfully, earning a 90/100 token score that highlights strong security. In addition, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a bug bounty program with CertiK, allocating $50,000 USDT in rewards across four tiers: critical, major, minor, and low. Every vulnerability level receives targeted incentives. Moreover, the MUTM team introduced a dashboard tracking the top 50 holders, who earn bonus tokens for maintaining positions. Consequently, this fosters community engagement. Meanwhile, a major giveaway awards $100,000 in MUTM to 10 winners, each getting $10,000. Participants submit wallet addresses, complete quests, and invest at least $50 in the presale to qualify. Therefore, these steps solidify Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the crypto to buy now amid market jitters. Protocol’s lending mechanics Borrowers supply overcollateralization, and the system issues mtTokens for deposits that accrue interest. Lenders redeem these for assets plus yields anytime. In peer-to-contract mode, pools enable instant access with dynamic rates based on utilization. When supply abounds, rates stay low to spur borrowing; scarcity raises them to draw deposits. Furthermore, peer-to-peer allows custom terms for specific assets and durations. Stable rates lock in predictability, though they start higher and may rebalance if variables surge. Loan-to-value ratios cap borrowings at safe levels, like 75% for ETH. Liquidation triggers at 80% ensure quick resolutions with bonuses for liquidators. Thus, these features make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) a practical choice for crypto investing. Gearing up for launch As Bitcoin’s crash eases, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out as the crypto to buy now, blending security with yield potential. Its presale progress and protocol innovations counter the downturn effectively. Investors find value in this steady ascent.

While Bitcoin and the majority of altcoins turned red, many altcoins, especially among the top 100 altcoins, lost more than 40% of their value in the last hour, attracting attention. As the cryptocurrency world tries to leave the great crash that occurred on Friday behind, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins have begun to recover. While Bitcoin surpassed $115,000 and Ethereum surpassed $4,100, Binance Coin (BNB), which stood out with its strong performance during the recent decline, made a name for itself again. BNB is on the rise again! BNB, which broke records in succession in the past weeks and reached a new ATH by exceeding $1,300, has now surpassed $1,300 again. Trading at $1,330, BNB has also surpassed Tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin, in terms of market capitalization. BNB is currently the third largest cryptocurrency in the market, just behind Bitcoin and Ethereum, with a value of $185 billion. USDT became the fourth largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $179 billion. While many altcoins are still struggling to reach their pre-drop levels, BNB has surpassed those levels with a 15.7% surge in the last 24 hours. Why Is BNB So Strong? CZ Explained! While BNB attracts attention with its strong stance and unstoppable rise, Binance founder CZ made a new post about BNB. CZ stated that people often ask him, “Why is BNB so strong?” At this point, CZ said that BNB's success is due to the Binance team standing behind BNB and its users. “Some people ask why BNB is so strong? While others tried to ignore, hide, shift blame, or attack competitors, key players in the BNBChain ecosystem (Binance, Venus, and more) put hundreds of millions of dollars out of their own pockets to PROTECT USERS.

World Liberty Financial price prediction for 2025 expects the price of WLFI to surge toward $0.41. By 2031, we expect the World Liberty Financial price to record a maximum price of $1.4. Donald Trump has embraced the title of the “crypto president”, a label that has fueled massive speculation across the crypto industry. After Trump’s 2024 election victory, the price of Bitcoin surged, a move many analysts and traders called a bullish signal for the broader cryptocurrency market. Building on this momentum, Trump introduced his own branded tokens—most notably the $TRUMP token and $MELANIA memecoin—cementing his direct involvement in the world of digital assets. Whether Trump’s push into crypto is driven by policy goals or personal profit, one message is clear: he intends to make cryptocurrency part of both his political strategy and financial portfolio. However, Trump’s personal involvement in crypto tokens raises critical ethical questions. If a sitting or future U.S. president profits directly from token sales, DeFi projects, or blockchain ventures, it risks blurring the line between public duty and private gain. One project drawing major attention is World Liberty Financial after major listings, a Trump-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. This article explores what World Liberty Financial is, and what Trump’s embrace of crypto could mean for the future of Bitcoin, memecoins, and U.S. crypto policy.

WLFI crypto news World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a crypto venture linked to the Trump family, sold part of its locked token holdings to Bitcoin mining firm Hut 8 for inclusion in the latter’s long-term crypto reserve. Though WLFI didn’t specify the amount, on-chain data suggests about 100 million tokens were sold at $0.25 each, totaling roughly $25 million. WLFI recently sold tokens at $0.25 to Hut8 for their treasury. The locked tokens sent from the WLFI treasury were simply to satisfy that sale — not new issuance, not dilution. We appreciate Hut8’s support as a long-term partner. 🦅 — WLFI (@worldlibertyfi) October 3, 2025 Is WLFI a good investment? Trading $WLFI will be very risky. Since it’s a new and highly hyped token with only a small amount available at launch, the price could change quickly and unpredictably. Liquidity will be thin, so even one big trade might move the market. It’s normal for tokens like this to surge at launch and then drop as early buyers cash out. However, considering its background and ongoing trading volume, WLFI can turn out to be a good investment option in the long-term. Why is the WLFI price up today? Sellers failed to maintain demand around $0.1 level, resulting in an upward correction. What is the WLFI price prediction for 2025? By 2025, analysts predict that World Liberty Financial (WLFI) will start the year at $0.15, with an average trading price of $0.37, and could climb as high as $0.41. Will WLFI price touch $1? Yes, WLFI price might touch the $1 milestone by the end of 2030. However, the token might attain this level much earlier, depending on the future market sentiment and buying demand. Will WLFI Price Reach $10? If everything remains good and WLFI gains recognition, its price might surpass $10 by 2040. Is WLFI a good long-term investment? As World Liberty Financial aims to expand its offerings, it might gain a significant position in the altcoin market. Hence, WLFI can be a good long-term investment option. The WLFI long term price outlook is looking strong due to its strong political support. WLFI price prediction October 2025 Analysts expect a steady surge in crypto market prices in October month.

ZEC is back above $286 on signs of deliberate buying. ZCash (ZEC) resumed its growth, standing above $286 in the new week. The token was almost unaffected by the weekend market crash, instead showing signs of robust buying. ZEC recovered to over $286 on Monday, later slipping to $278.20. The privacy coin had more subdued trading volumes as crypto market participants still reeled from the weekend’s liquidations. ZEC saw volumes of just under $1B for the past day. The ZEC recovery still supports the overall trend of privacy coins , as many of those assets are in the green. However, XMR and LTC took a step back, reflecting the general altcoin slump. For some analysts, the ZEC rally may be over, but the coin has shown significant strength. Is a mysterious whale buying ZEC? One of the reasons for the ZEC rally was special attention from influencers. ZEC was the only ticker directly mentioned by investor Naval Ravikant for the past few years, as he decided to talk about cryptography and privacy. As Cryptopolitan reported earlier, the renewed interest in ZEC brought the coin back to levels not see since 2018. The recent wave of buying is also raising suggestions that the recent influencers are putting their money where their mouth is and re-accumulating ZEC. The recent ZEC expansion followed the latest tweet from Naval Ravikant, reiterating the demand for privacy. Crypto is… Desperate gamblers chasing their first bag. Investors funding the buildout of the global casino. Bankers hypnotizing the masses to collect their vig. …all meaningless and ephemeral without the cypherpunks, who defend the dream of encrypted and unstoppable cash. — Naval (@naval) October 11, 2025 ZEC is showing signs of accumulation that go beyond short-term market fluctuations. One of the signs is the growth of ZEC locked with maximum privacy, already taking up 26.36% of the total supply. ZEC is flowing into the shielded Orchard pool, showing growing demand for privacy. | Source: ZEC Hub Dashboard . The supply of ZEC in the Orchard Shielded Pool is also going vertical, signaling that the privacy narrative is taken seriously. The recent talk about crypto surveillance accelerated the inflow into Orchard Pool, making it one of the biggest holdings of ZEC. Retail buyers flock to Zashi wallet ZEC still rises on a mix of retail buying and some derivative speculation. Even after the recent market shakedown, open interest for ZEC recovered to over $256M. However, the more interesting trend for ZEC is the activity on Near Protocol and Zashi Wallet. More retail traders are moving into ZEC through decentralized accumulation. ZEC buying accelerated on Near Intents, going through the Zashi app. More retail buyers also used decentralized swaps to acquire untraceable ZEC. | Source: Dune Analytics . Activity on Near Intents shows ZEC buying accelerated in October, allowing for direct withdrawals to Zashi wallet. The end goal is to acquire more ZEC in an untraceable manner, and disconnect the token from any records and identities on centralized exchanges. The Zashi app started its decentralized swaps in early October, adding to the potential for re-accumulating ZEC. The addition of the Zashi wallet option also boosted overall ZEC usage , with a growth in all types of transfers. ZCash has been positioning to work as a simple payment coin, similar to Venmo, though with shielded transactions. For the first time, ZEC is gaining a new use case, veiled P2P retail transfers that are untraceable. The Near ecosystem is one of the hubs for switching between non-privacy coins and tokens into ZEC.

Key Takeaways: Steak ‘n Shake canceled its Ether payment plan after Bitcoin supporters criticized the move. The fast-food chain’s loyalty to Bitcoin follows a 15% sales boost since adopting BTC payments. Vitalik Buterin said crypto businesses should commit to one community instead of appealing to all. The 90-year-old American fast-food chain, which began accepting Bitcoin in May, ran a poll on X asking its 468,800 followers if it should expand its crypto payment options to include Ether. Steak ‘n Shake Suspends Ether Poll, Declares Loyalty to Bitcoiners The poll drew nearly 49,000 votes, with 53% in favor. However, just four hours later, the company abruptly halted the vote, declaring loyalty to Bitcoiners. “Poll suspended. Our allegiance is with Bitcoiners. You have spoken,” Steak ‘n Shake posted , signaling a retreat from the idea. The chain’s relationship with Bitcoiners has been lucrative. Since introducing BTC payments in the U.S., France, Monaco, and Spain, Steak ‘n Shake reported a 15% year-over-year increase in same-store sales during the third quarter. Executives credited Bitcoiners’ support for the rise, which may explain the brand’s cautious response to criticism. Poll suspended. Our allegiance is with Bitcoiners. You have spoken. Who even allowed this? I'm back at my desk. – Steaktoshi https://t.co/4RkASUVa8L — Steak 'n Shake (@SteaknShake) October 12, 2025 Prominent Bitcoin advocates were quick to condemn the ETH poll. Adam Simecka, creator of the self-custody wallet Manna, vowed never to dine at the restaurant again if it accepted Ether. “The fact that you even created the ETH poll is disappointing,” added influencer Colleen, known as The Bitcoin Gal. Developer Carman said the move had already damaged the company’s reputation among Bitcoin loyalists. The episode underscores how deeply entrenched crypto tribalism remains. Bitcoin purists continue to argue that BTC is the only true form of sound digital money — echoing Michael Saylor’s famous line, “There is no second-best crypto asset.” They have credibility on my eyes due to Bitcoin and tallow. — Ben Justman (@BenJustman) October 11, 2025 Interestingly, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin offered a nuanced take , suggesting that businesses adopting crypto should commit to one community rather than trying to please everyone. “We need the stubborn ones who believe in their cause and their tribe,” he said. Despite the controversy, Steak ‘n Shake appears to be doubling down on its Bitcoin identity. The company announced plans to launch a “Bitcoin Steakburger” on October 16 to celebrate its embrace of BTC. Payments Companies Push into Crypto In May, crypto payments platform Mesh unveiled its Apple Pay integration , which allows merchants partnered with Mesh to accept crypto payments via Apple Pay. Mesh’s partnership with Apple Pay came as payments companies continue to expand into digital assets. In April, global payments giant Stripe said it is developing a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin aimed at companies operating outside the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe. The announcement came after Stripe’s regulatory approval to acquire Bridge, a stablecoin payments network designed to rival traditional banking systems and SWIFT-based transfers. Earlier this year, Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO and outspoken Bitcoin advocate, publicly urged Signal Messenger to integrate Bitcoin for peer-to-peer (P2P) payments. Dorsey’s call was echoed by David Marcus, former president of PayPal and current CEO of Lightspark, who stated that “all non-transactional apps should connect to Bitcoin.” The post Fast Food Chain Steak ‘n Shake Halts Ether Payment Plan After Bitcoin Fans Push Back appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Bitcoin|Ethereum|Payment,EN,0,0,CRYPTOCURRENCY|BTC|ETH|REGULATION,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-13 07:49:43

Here’s why",https://timestabloid.com/peter-brandt-flips-bullish-on-xrp-bitcoin-xlm-and-ethereum-heres-why/,"In a recent post, veteran trader Peter Brandt shared his latest chart analysis of several major cryptocurrencies. The long-time market analyst accompanied his commentary with technical charts for XRP, Bitcoin (BTC), Stellar (XLM), and Ethereum (ETH), offering insight into how Brandt currently views the technical posture of several leading digital assets. A few final posts for the weekend, then I will leave you youngsters with your dreams $XRP – just a minor reaction in bigger theme of things $BTC – bull still alive and well $XLM – a bull waking from a nap $ETH – ready to rock and roll If I change my mind I won't let you know pic.twitter.com/rL1nVETYSn — Peter Brandt (@PeterLBrandt) October 11, 2025 XRP’s Pause Within a Larger Structure Brandt described XRP as experiencing “just a minor reaction in [the] bigger theme of things.” His chart for XRP shows a monthly formation resembling a large symmetrical consolidation pattern that has unfolded since 2018. The asset broke out of this triangle in late 2024, after a massive surge that sent it up by over 500%. However, it has struggled recently. A few days ago, Brandt said he would short XRP based on what he identified as a descending triangle. The market dipped shortly afterward , aligning with that view. Despite this decline, the latest update suggests that he sees the price dip as a smaller retracement within a continuing technical structure rather than a complete breakdown. XRP remains above its long-term rising support line, indicating that despite near-term weakness, Brandt continues to monitor a broader range-bound phase rather than a decisive bearish shift. Bitcoin Maintaining Its Uptrend For Bitcoin, Brandt noted that the bulls are “still alive and well.” The weekly view shows BTC maintaining a consistent series of higher lows since late 2022, with the price currently trading above a long-term ascending trendline. Volume patterns remain steady, and the asset continues to respect key moving averages. While Bitcoin has seen several sharp corrections during its recent cycle, Brandt’s latest assessment suggests that he views these pullbacks as normal within an ongoing uptrend. His brief statement reflects confidence in the structure of the chart and implies that BTC has not yet violated critical technical levels that would negate its bullish setup. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XLM and ETH Show Signs of Renewal Brandt called XLM “a bull waking from a nap,” noting its triangular consolidation and gradual buildup of higher lows since 2020. The pattern remains contained but suggests developing strength if resistance breaks. Ethereum, labeled as “ready to rock and roll,” shows a steady consolidation within an ascending channel that has persisted for years. The asset’s price continues to test resistance while maintaining support, reflecting a constructive structure. Together, both charts indicate markets that have stabilized after long periods of sideways trading, with Brandt signaling cautious optimism for potential upward movement if current technical formations hold.

The Dutch government utilized the Goods Availability Act in September to acquire Nexperia. Under the law, officials can stop or reverse major business decisions, and the government stated that it acted because Nexperia exhibited serious and urgent management problems. Dutch government seizes Nexperia for security reasons Dutch government officials stated that Nexperia exhibited signs of poor management , which could have ripple effects on the company’s ability to safeguard important chipmaking knowledge, designs, and equipment within Europe. The Goods Availability Act allowed the government to prevent Nexperia from making any major business changes for a period of one year. Nexperia cannot sell parts of its company, change its top management, or restructure its operations without permission from policymakers. However, Nexperia can still manufacture and sell chips as usual, so its workers and clients are not affected; however, all important business decisions will be under strict supervision. Officials in The Hague did not specify the problems with Nexperia, but their statement indicated they had deep concerns about how the Chinese parent company, Wingtech, managed its European operations. Experts say the Goods Availability Act is only used in emergencies, such as when the government needs to secure supplies of food, fuel, or medicine during a crisis. However, using it for a semiconductor company highlights just how important the Netherlands views chips as, comparable to energy or defense materials. Analysts say other Chinese-owned companies in Europe will likely be more careful about how they operate. It could also prompt European governments to introduce new rules that make it more difficult for foreign buyers to acquire full control of companies that develop or design advanced technology. Wingtech faces more global setbacks Wingtech has been facing growing resistance from Western governments as it tries to expand its reach in the global chip industry. The company, based in China, acquired the Dutch chipmaker Nexperia in 2018 for approximately $3.6 billion, aiming to establish a strong international presence and compete with the world’s largest semiconductor companies. The company’s troubles in foreign markets grew slowly. Still, they became too much to ignore in 2022, when the British government ordered Wingtech to reverse its takeover of the United Kingdom’s largest microchip factory, Newport Wafer Fab. The British authorities stated that reviews indicated the acquisition might pose risks to national security and the country’s ability to produce critical chips independently. In 2023, Wingtech also found itself on the U.S. Entity List . This list is a trade blacklist that limits how American firms can conduct business with foreign companies deemed to be security risks. These restrictions made it extremely difficult for Wingtech to acquire the advanced machines, chips, and design tools it needed from U.S. suppliers, which in turn harmed the relationship with partners and clients in Western markets. The pressure on the company increased in 2025 when a senior Nexperia executive filed a court petition in the Netherlands, requesting an investigation into the company’s management. The petition alleged that there were serious issues within the company and requested temporary measures to ensure the safety of its operations. The Dutch court responded by suspending Wingtech’s founder, Zhang Xuezheng, from all his roles at Nexperia until the investigation is completed. Nexperia continues to operate despite these difficulties, and major automotive brands and consumer electronics companies across Europe and other regions still use its chips. Factories are still operating, workers are still employed, and products are still being shipped, but there is now considerable uncertainty regarding the company’s ownership. Analysts say that Wingtech’s experience is now a symbol of the growing tension between China’s global business ambitions and the West’s determination to protect its technological independence.

Kiyosaki described Trump's policy, which now allows 401k funds to be used in “alternative investments,” including real estate debt, physical gold and silver, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as a “get rich opportunity.” He said the move will allow more people to achieve financial security and extend the retirement years of the “baby boomer” generation.

Kiyosaki also noted that even renowned investor Warren Buffett acknowledged the financial hardships faced by baby boomers and the fact that inflation was eroding the purchasing power of 401k accounts. Kiyosaki stated that he has never held a 401k, mutual fund, or ETF, and that he makes his investments from the perspective of a business owner and a cash flow quadrant investor. The renowned author concluded his speech by saying, “I will continue to purchase gold, silver, Bitcoin, Ethereum, oil, and real estate.” *This is not investment advice.
