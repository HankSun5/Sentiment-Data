Still, the latest dips could be setting the stage for one of the strongest bullish rallies in recent history. In early October, Bitcoin skyrocketed to a record-breaking $126,080, briefly sending capital surging into major altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which had already shattered their previous yearly highs. That momentum didn’t last long. Later that same week, the market slipped sharply after former President Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports. Investor sentiment quickly turned cautious in anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC decision. Nonetheless, several analysts view the correction as a necessary cooldown, clearing out excessive leverage and weaker positions before the next sustained uptrend. Below are three top altcoins to consider based on their upside potential. Ripple (XRP): 2025’s Cross-Border Payment Powerhouse Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , underpins a global payment system known for rapid transactions and ultra-low fees, posing a growing challenge to legacy networks like SWIFT. Backed by the UN Capital Development Fund and partnered with prominent U.S. financial institutions, XRP has risen to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at $143.8 billion. The introduction of Ripple’s dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, underscores the company’s ambition to capture a share of the booming stablecoin sector. Over the past 12 months, XRP has gained 349%, reaching a seven-year high of $3.65 in mid-July, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 62% growth in the same period. With an RSI reading of 39 and a clear divergence from its 30-day moving average, XRP appears poised for renewed upward movement this week. Technical patterns reveal two bullish flags formed over the summer, suggesting potential for continued growth if ETF approvals materialize by mid-October. Should U.S. lawmakers enact comprehensive crypto legislation, XRP could climb even further, possibly landing between $5 and $10. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Prime Rival and This Week’s Market Leader Solana ($SOL) continues to reinforce its reputation as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain platforms. With a market cap hovering above $100 billion and almost $11 billion locked in its DeFi ecosystem, Solana’s network expansion shows no signs of slowing down. Investors are closely watching for potential approval of U.S.-based Solana spot ETFs, which could attract significant institutional inflows similar to those seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. After bottoming out near $100 in April, SOL now trades around $184. Improved regulatory clarity has lifted investor confidence, while technical indicators, an RSI of 40, and a notable deviation from its 30-day moving average, suggest SOL might currently be undervalued. Support remains firm around $150, with major resistance near $250. A clean break above this level could spark another major rally, potentially revisiting its all-time high of $293.31 or even surpassing $500 in a strong bull market. TRON (TRX): Justin Sun’s Blockchain Defies the Downtrend Founded in 2017 by Justin Sun, TRON ($TRX) was designed as a direct competitor to Ethereum. Today, it stands as the second-largest layer one “Ethereum killer” after Solana, boasting a market cap of roughly $30.4 billion compared to Solana’s $100.6 billion. Like Ethereum and Solana, TRON supports sophisticated smart contracts that power a wide range of DeFi applications, from gaming and NFTs to lending and asset tokenization. At present, TRON is the only top-10 cryptocurrency posting gains amid a market-wide decline. While the global crypto market capitalization of $3.74 trillion fell 5% overnight, with Bitcoin dropping 4% and Ethereum and Solana both shedding about 6%. Meanwhile, TRON only fell 1% to $0.3127. Currently, TRON remains 25% below its all-time high of $0.4313, recorded on December 4, 2024. The sharp upward movement on its chart shows a rapid surge of buying activity that drove a 76% increase within 24 hours. TRON may encounter resistance near its prior peak, but a breakout could see prices approach the $0.50 mark. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): 2025’s Breakout Meme Coin Uniting Bitcoin Power and Innovation Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has quickly become one of 2025’s most talked-about presale tokens. The project enhances Bitcoin’s capabilities through a proprietary Layer-2 solution, enabling lightning-fast, low-cost transfers wrapped in a meme coin format. Built for scalability and utility, HYPER introduces decentralized governance via a DAO, advanced smart contracts, and superior transaction speeds, all atop its unique Layer-2 framework. The presale has already raised over $24.5 million, with analysts predicting potential 10x or greater returns post-launch. Developed on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER’s ecosystem includes a seamless Canonical Bridge for Bitcoin transfers, decentralized app compatibility, and built-in meme coin integration. A recent audit by Coinsult confirmed zero security vulnerabilities, further strengthening investor trust. HYPER tokens power key network functions such as staking, governance, and transaction fees, offering early investors staking rewards as high as 48% APY. Bitcoin is going HYPER, don’t miss the start of something big. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

The project recently passed a 16,000 investor milestone , indicating the large level of confidence from both retail and early institutional players. This milestone represents one of the most successful presales for 2025 . It underlines the capacity of the project to attract the trust of a cautious market still recovering from past volatility. Analysts now call MAGACOIN FINANCE a top candidate for 2025’s best crypto presale with the potential for 100x returns post-listing . Investors Rush In Before Prices Move Higher Investor growth has been faster than expected. Each of the presale rounds has closed early, indicating that interest continues to rise. Buyers are rushing to enter early to maximize their entries before the next price tier is activated. This continuous stream of investors demonstrates that their confidence in MAGACOIN FINANCE is not hype, but genuine. The project has been an eye catcher to individuals who prefer structure over bewildering marketing claims. All changes have been transparent, all progress has been visible, and all progress has been steady. That stability has ensured that MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most stable early-stage crypto projects in 2025. Trust Built on Transparency and Security The success of MAGACOIN FINANCE is based on transparency. The entire audit of the project was conducted by HashEx , a reputable blockchain security company that has high standards. The audit has ensured that the MAGACOIN FINANCE contract is fully safe and it has no concealed risks. This confirmation has given both new and old investors confidence that has been shaken by market deceits in the recent past. Its tiered pricing structure also adds to the fairness equation by rewarding early participants and managing token allocation. This way, a healthy ecosystem is developed, and heavy dumping is prevented after listing. Transparency, safety, and fairness have been the perfect case of reliability. MAGACOIN FINANCE is considered a safe and serious project that is not a short-term gamble. Exchange Listings Add to the Excitement The upcoming exchange listings have created more buzz among investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE will be launching on some of the popular trading platforms soon after the end of the presale. Listings often play a major role in price discovery. Analysts expect to see a strong demand from traders who did not have the opportunity to buy the token before it was available on the public market. This next step could draw in another wave of attention as investors see listings as validation. With the foundations already well-built on verified security and an increasing support from the community, the launch of MAGACOIN FINANCE on exchanges could be the start of its recognition in the wider market. As the momentum of the coin grows, there are now many calling it the best crypto to buy early, as returns are expected to increase as the liquidity rises post-launch. Analysts Predict 100x ROI Potential Analysts still believe that early players have a significant advantage. According to them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the combination of timing, credibility, and enthusiasm of investors, three components of most 100x stories. The Patriot50X bonus , providing the buyer with 50% additional tokens included in the project, has served to solidify the enthusiasm. It has propelled fresh investors in the short run and given them the confidence to participate in the long run. The whales are also starting to silently position themselves as well, and the project is viewed as a unique early opportunity where there is safety and growth potential. Final Outlook MAGACOIN FINANCE has acquired 16,000+ investors, has passed a confirmed audit, and has verified future exchange listings. These achievements demonstrate that its emergence is not accidental – it is organized, structured, and community-driven. With transparent updates, clear rewards, and a strong foundation, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as one of the best crypto presales of 2025 . Its stability, ease, and earlier trust place it in an ideal position to serve a market that is willing to trust once more.

The October rally enthusiasm, aka “Uptober”, abruptly ended after President Donald Trump announced sweeping 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, a move that rattled global markets and sparked one of crypto’s sharpest one-day sell-offs in recent memory. With the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC meeting approaching, traders are adopting a cautious stance, waiting for hints of potential monetary easing that could reignite risk appetite. Veteran analysts, however, view the recent pullback as a positive development, emphasizing that steep corrections tend to purge speculative excess and leveraged positions, often laying the groundwork for more durable long-term gains. Binance Coin (BNB): Perplexity AI sees Expanding Dominance Firstly, Binance Coin ($BNB) was originally designed as the exchange’s utility token, but it has evolved into one of the most multifaceted digital assets, driving a growing ecosystem that spans NFTs, decentralized apps, and payment solutions. Source: Perplexity AI BNB’s deflationary design, sustained through Binance’s periodic token burns, continues to support its long-term price resilience by systematically reducing supply over time. Its utility now extends far beyond the Binance platform, with BNB gaining traction among merchants worldwide, from gaming platforms to travel service providers. This widespread adoption has solidified its position among the world’s top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This month, BNB reached a record high of $1,369.99 before pulling back around 21%, following a strong breakout from a bullish pennant formation that developed earlier in the year. Currently showing an RSI of 47, BNB appears to be consolidating between buying and selling pressure. Should bullish momentum return, Perplexity AI believes BNB could push toward the $1,600 mark before the year’s end, while $580–$1,000 may serve as a key support zone in the event of another correction. XRP ($XRP): Claude Predicts a Potential Surge Toward $10 Claude AI’s modeling suggests Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , could see a dramatic upswing, possibly reaching between $5.50 and $6.20 by year-end, more than doubling its current value of about $2.40. Ripple’s landmark victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year ended a five-year legal saga, restoring investor confidence and driving XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 on July 18. Over the past year, XRP has skyrocketed 349%, handily outperforming Bitcoin’s 62% and Ethereum’s 46% gains. Technical analysis shows three distinct bullish flag formations in 2025, two of which emerged during the summer months, often a prelude to major upward moves. Strong seasonal tailwinds in October, potential ETF approvals, favorable regulatory developments, and Ripple’s expanding global partnerships could all help XRP recover recent losses and move closer to the $6 threshold, with $10 being a sober target in a bull-case scenario. Solana (SOL): Claude Forecasts a Break Above $500 Solana ($SOL) continues to reinforce its standing as one of the premier smart contract blockchains, boasting a market cap of more than $100 billion and almost $11 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its DeFi ecosystem. Speculation is heating up that U.S. regulators could approve a spot Solana ETF before the month’s end, a move that could attract substantial institutional capital, echoing the surges seen after Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launches. Solana also stands to benefit from broader industry trends such as the tokenization of real-world assets and the expansion of stablecoin infrastructure, both of which are gaining institutional momentum. Additionally, with transaction speeds and fees outpacing Ethereum’s, Solana remains one of the strongest contenders for mass adoption. After rising to $250 in January and retracing to $100 in April, SOL now trades near $184, suggesting renewed bullish potential. Its low RSI of 40 and proximity below its 30-day moving average indicate the asset may currently be undervalued. Having recently broken out of a bullish flag pattern, Claude projects that Solana could reach between $360 and $500 by year’s end, a rise of up to 70% above its previous all-time high of $293.31. Missed Dogecoin? Meet Maxi Doge (MAXI): The Next-Gen Meme Coin With Degen Energy Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a new entrant in the meme coin arena, has launched its presale phase, already drawing over $3.7 million from investors eager to ride the next viral crypto trend. Branded as Dogecoin’s “high-octane cousin,” Maxi Doge embraces the humor, hype, and community-driven ethos of crypto’s degen culture, focusing on engagement, viral memes, and grassroots participation. Developed as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI offers quicker, more cost-efficient, and eco-friendly transactions compared to traditional meme coins. The project’s marketing strategy centers on Telegram and Discord community events, trading competitions, and influencer collaborations to build early traction. Of its total 150.24 billion token supply, 25% is allocated to a “Maxi Fund” dedicated to marketing, ecosystem growth, and strategic partnerships. Staking is live, with yields reaching up to 82% APY, a figure that gradually decreases as more stakers join. The presale currently values MAXI at $0.000264, with incremental price increases set for each funding milestone. Investors can purchase tokens via MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Experts are now targeting a potential rise toward $200,000, identifying this new all-time high level as Bitcoin’s potential cycle top while suggesting that the cryptocurrency has yet to establish a definitive bottom. Bitcoin Price Explosion To Ignite Biggest Altcoin Season Ever According to digital asset analyst CrediBULL Crypto, Bitcoin’s next parabolic surge could catalyze the biggest altcoin season the market has ever seen. The analyst shared an Elliott Wave chart analysis, showing that BTC is in the early stages of its final fifth wave, a phase that has historically delivered some of the most explosive price rallies in bull markets. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Supercycle Still In Play? Wave 3 Tells A Story Of A Surge Looking at the chart, the first subwave of Wave 5 has already produced a 37% gain, suggesting that the upcoming third and fifth subwaves could be significantly larger, potentially driving Bitcoin well above $150,000 and even toward the $200,000 mark. CrediBULL Crypto argued that such a bullish move will not be grounded in logic or fundamentals but in market psychology, specifically speculation, greed, and euphoria. He revealed that this emotional environment often leads to extreme volatility, which fuels liquidity rotation into alternative cryptocurrencies. Historically, when investors begin redirecting capital away from Bitcoin into altcoins after a BTC top, it typically sparks a full-blown altcoin season. Many smaller-cap assets experience rapid, exponential gains during this time, especially as the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) declines temporarily. CrediBULL Crypto emphasizes that this phase of irrational exuberance is a natural part of the market cycle. When the Bitcoin mania peaks, the resulting FOMO often drives investors to seek higher and faster yields in other assets. The analyst further added that as long as BTC continues to climb, altcoins are likely to follow suit. Analyst Recommends Locking In Ahead Of The Rally In a prior analysis on X social media, CrediBULL Crypto reaffirmed his belief that the current market cycle top has not yet been reached. Despite recent volatility and market crash fueled by the devastating liquidation event on October 10, the analyst maintains that Bitcoin remains structurally bullish on High-Timeframes (HTFs). Related Reading: Expert Says ‘The Time Has Come’, What Could Drive The Next Explosive Altcoin Season He noted that the recent market pullbacks could offer opportunities for traders affected by the liquidation cascade to rebuild positions ahead of the next explosive leg. He stated that even a small allocation, about 10% of their previous holdings, could yield substantial returns if the projected parabolic move unfolds. CrediBULL Crypto has highlighted a critical invalidation level near $74,000, suggesting that as long as the Bitcoin price holds above this zone, its long-term uptrend remains intact. He doubled down on his bullish projection, insisting that the next major rally could propel BTC significantly above $150,000.

Waller at the Payments Innovation Conference on October 21, 2025, Fed staff are examining a new kind of account that would let certain non-bank firms connect directly to the central bank’s payment system. Reports have disclosed the idea is being called a “payment account” or informally a “skinny” master account. What The Federal Reserve Is Proposing The plan would stop short of giving full bank privileges. The accounts would likely not earn interest and would not have access to the Fed’s discount window. Balance caps and other risk limits are expected to be part of the design. Waller said staff are still working through the details and that the concept remains exploratory rather than a finalized rule. Limits And Safeguards Regulators intend to keep guardrails. According to public comments, only “legally eligible” entities would qualify. That phrase leaves open which corporate forms — for example, trust companies, state-chartered firms or other charter types — will be allowed. Fed opens the gates for fintech and crypto access Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller revealed today that the Fed is studying a new model of “payment accounts”. Streamlined accounts that would allow fintech and crypto firms to access the Fed’s payment infrastructure,… https://t.co/QphKaopcRo — StrongSHx (@StrongSHX) October 21, 2025 Reports note the accounts would be smaller in scope than a normal master account, with explicit restrictions aimed at reducing exposure to the payment system. Oversight, AML/KYC checks and operational risk controls are expected to be central to any application process. Why This Matters Now Access to the Fed’s rails has long been limited to banks, which forced many fintech and crypto firms to rely on intermediary banks. Connecting directly, even in a limited way, could reduce steps in settlement and cut certain counterparty risks. There is also context: the Fed withdrew earlier guidance on bank crypto activities this year — on April 24, 2025 — signaling a shift in tone toward integrating new players into payments. Who Stands To Gain Or Lose Crypto firms and stablecoin issuers could find it easier to move funds and settle transactions. Banks that currently provide access to non-banks may face stiffer competition for those services. At the same time, regulators and bank supervisors will still carry the burden of preventing fraud, illicit finance and operational breakdowns. Market participants are likely to watch how the Fed coordinates with the OCC and the FDIC on questions of charters and deposit insurance.

According to the UK’s top banking supervisor, granting UK banks and building societies relief on their £150 billion gilt holdings, as well as their multibillion-pound foreign government bond portfolios, would “risk forgetting one of the main lessons from the 2023 banking failures.” Speaking at the annual Mansion House regulators’ dinner in London on Wednesday, Woods said such a move would be “equivalent to ripping off our jacket, warm hat and gloves and throwing them all over the nearest cliff,” describing it as “profound — and highly risky.” Lessons from 2023 bank failures highlight risks of relaxing leverage ratios Bank lobbyists in Britain and the United States have called on regulators this year to exclude sovereign debt from leverage ratio calculations, which dictate how much capital banks must hold for each dollar of assets. In the UK, it would release around £5 billion of equity capital currently trapped in gilt portfolios at a minimum leverage ratio of 3.25%. Woods, a BoE deputy governor who is set to step down in 2026, noted that the failure of three mid-sized US banks over two years ago — including Silicon Valley Bank — indicated “bonds issued by sound governments, if liquidated in size, can carry major consequences to banks’ balance sheets due to interest rate risk”. SVB’s 2023 collapse, which also affected its UK subsidiary, followed losses on its large US government bond holdings after interest rates rose sharply, sparking a depositor run. Woods added that lifting capital requirements on government debt could “allow a very large increase in bank leverage given the size of banks’ sovereign holdings” and would “largely remove sovereign risk from the bank capital framework” unless banks actively sell the bonds. UK Finance, the main lobbying group for British banks, has previously proposed exempting gilts from leverage ratio calculations as part of its “plan for growth” regulatory reforms. Meanwhile, in June, the US Federal Reserve proposed lowering the leverage ratio for the country’s biggest banks from at least 5% to between 3.5% and 4.25%, aligning more closely with international standards. The Fed did not include a government debt exemption in the proposal. Still, it sought feedback on it as a potential “additional modification,” amid lobbying arguments that it could improve liquidity in US Treasury markets. Financial sector urged to strengthen cybersecurity and risk resilience Speaking at the Mansion House gathering, Nikhil Rathi, CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority, stated that there is growing recognition in the UK of the need to manage cyber risks. He cited the £1.9 billion cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover this year as an illustration of the threats faced by UK businesses. He said that too often, finance had been seen as independent of national security, with insufficient investment in long-term resilience. Rathi also noted that most catastrophe- and cyber-risks in the world remain uninsured, leaving companies, credit ratings, risk premia rates, prices, and ultimately households to bear the burden. Calling on banks and insurers to “step up”, Rathi added: “Let’s all harness the City’s expertise to address the insurance challenges. We will keep shining a light on both the risks and opportunities.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The interest comes just weeks after the New York-based company wrapped up a $300 million funding round that valued it at $5 billion. Venture capital firms are now lining up to pour more cash in, with some discussions floating valuations as high as $12 billion. The people involved in the talks didn’t want to be named because the details are private, but the appetite for this startup is clearly heating up. Earlier this month, Kalshi said its latest round was co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. Back in June, the company raised $185 million at a $2 billion valuation, led by crypto-focused investor Paradigm. Kalshi lets users trade on the outcomes of real-world events, anything from presidential elections and sports games to the duration of a government shutdown. In a recent post on X, co-founder and CEO Tarek Mansour said the company’s annualized trading volume hit $50 billion. Kalshi expands after court win and surging volumes For years, regulators treated prediction markets like a legal grey zone. That changed after Kalshi’s court victory last October, which gave it the right to list presidential election contracts. The ruling ignited a flood of trading on the platform, sending volumes to new highs. Kalshi used its federal license to open markets on sports contests nationwide, expanding what users can legally trade on. This move has boosted its growth and put it in a tighter race with its closest competitor, Polymarket. One person familiar with the company’s latest fundraising reportedly told Bloomberg that the new capital could “strengthen Kalshi’s position in a crowded and fast-moving space.” Both platforms have become magnets for speculators betting on everything from political outcomes to global sports events. Venture capital firms are allegedly competing for early stakes in Kalshi and even making unsolicited, preemptive offers before the company even opens new fundraising rounds. Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has allowed Kalshi to expand its event-based markets, but state gaming regulators, who traditionally oversee sports betting, have been pushing back in court. The CFTC says it still has concerns of market manipulation and insider trading in platforms like this. Wall Street companies and gambling operators are moving fast to partner with prediction exchanges before the industry matures. The National Hockey League this week announced multiyear partnerships with both Kalshi and Polymarket, making it the first major U.S. sports league to embrace these markets directly. At the same time, the industry is seeing an arms race in valuations.Just recently, Cryptopolitan reported that the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns the New York Stock Exchange, would invest up to $2 billion in Polymarket at a valuation of around $8 billion, a massive jump from its $1 billion market cap earlier this year in a Founders Fund-led round.

The automaker said the AI assistant will also tap into the cars’ data to provide alerts, pre-condition the climate inside the cars, and explain driving features. GM said the AI assistant will be preinstalled in both gas and electric cars using the Android Automotive operating system for infotainment. The company is among the first automakers to integrate the Gemini update directly into its cars. Gemini will also become the default voice recognition system, which is expected to possess strong natural language capabilities. However, given the unpredictable nature of generative AI chatbots, GM clarified that it remains to be seen how reliable Gemini will perform on the roads and whether it will consistently make other automatic adjustments, such as climate control. The company stated that its latest upgrade directly competed with Tesla’s xAI Grok and Mercedes’s ChatGPT. Richardson claims GM’s Gemini-powered AI assistant performs better GM’s Vice President of Software and Services, Dave Richardson, said his company’s Gemini-powered AI assistant will perform better than other AI assistants. However, he pointed out that one of the challenges with most AI assistants is that they are frustrating because they do not understand accents very well. They also do not know how to respond appropriately when words are not spoken correctly. Richardson asserted that the most remarkable thing about large language models (LLMs) is that they appear to be unaffected by the above problem. He clarified that such systems have context about previous conversations, which they can retrieve for reference. “They’re flexible in how you speak to them…so overall you’re getting a better, more natural experience.” – Dave Richardson , Vice President of Software and Services at GM The automaker believes that the Gemini-powered AI assistant will make drafting and sending messages, prepping for meetings, or even planning routes with extra stops on the go an enjoyable experience. The assistant will also have internet access, enabling it to crawl the web for answers to specific questions. However, Richardson stressed that drivers will have control over the information accessed or used by the assistant. GM said the new voice assistant is a step towards developing its custom-built AI to connect to cars through GM’s in-car concierge, OnStar. The assistant will be available via Google’s Play Store as an over-the-air upgrade to OnStar-equipped cars produced from 2015 onwards. GM unveils plans for a hands-off, eyes-off driver-assistant system At the GM Forward event, the automaker’s CEO, Mary Barra, announced that her company plans to introduce a new driver-assist system, allowing drivers to take their eyes off the road or be hands-free, starting in 2028. She added that the company was also showcasing other initiatives designed to transform its cars from modes of transportation to intelligent assistants. GM further announced that it is developing a new centralized computing platform, which is expected to start rolling out with the Escalade IQ in 2028. Barra said at the event in lower Manhattan that her company is ready to usher in a new era of mobility. Sterling Anderson, GM’s Chief Product Officer, said the company’s vision is to produce a car that knows and looks out for its driver. Anderson believes centralized computing is a foundational piece of GM’s plans to improve the capabilities of its cars. The automaker also emphasized its plans to upgrade ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems) to feature eyes-off, hands-free driving technology. GM expects to roll out the driving assistance feature in 2028, beginning with the Cadillac Escalade IQ EV. Anderson said this autonomy will make roads safer. Anderson explained that GM’s future cars will utilize lidar (light detection and ranging) systems to enhance their ability to detect their surroundings. He added that the system is expected to reach its full potential through incremental transformations. Get seen where it counts.

With this integration, Bealls becomes the first national retailer to accept digital currencies from any crypto wallet across more than a dozen blockchains at once. The announcement marks Bealls’ 110th anniversary and highlights the company’s ongoing focus on innovation and improving customer experience. Over the years, the retailer has invested in new technologies, such as in-store kiosks and online shopping, and this latest move places it among the early adopters of crypto payments in physical retail. Bealls Makes a Crypto Leap According to the official press release, the system supports a wide range of assets, including stablecoins and meme coins. Customers will be able to make purchases using digital currencies at Bealls, Bealls Florida, and Home Centric stores. As part of the deal, the retailer will utilize Flexa Payments, a digital payment solution designed for speed and versatility. The platform enables merchants to accept over 99 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and stablecoins such as USDC, from more than 300 different wallets. Flexa Payments connects with existing retail systems and operates across mobile, in-app, and in-store environments. It also delivers near-instant transaction processing while automatically supporting new currencies and wallet applications as they become available. The partnership comes as more Americans are turning to digital assets for everyday transactions. Bealls cited a study that revealed that, as of early 2025, around 28% of US adults, which is estimated to be about 65 million people, own cryptocurrency. The collaboration with Flexa broadens the company’s footprint in brick-and-mortar retail while simultaneously advancing its goal of making digital payments as simple and widely accepted as card or mobile wallet transactions. In a statement, the Florida-based company’s Chairman and CEO, Matt Beall, said, “Digital currency will reshape how the world transacts, and Bealls is proud to be at the forefront of that transformation. Our partnership with Flexa is about more than payments; it’s about preparing for the future of commerce and continuing to innovate for the next 110 years.” Institutions Diving Deeper into Digital Assets Bealls’ move reflects a wider trend across finance and commerce, where institutions are steadily increasing exposure to blockchain-based investments. A study conducted by State Street found that allocations to cryptocurrencies, digital cash, and tokenized securities are expected to more than double by 2028. Over half of those surveyed believe tokenized assets will form up to a quarter of total portfolios by 2030. Asset managers are especially active, holding more Bitcoin and Ethereum than asset owners. A small but growing share is even experimenting with newer categories like meme coins and NFTs.

BTC is now up ~15% year-to-date and sits ~13% below its record close from earlier this month. ETH is now up ~16% year-to-date and is ~20% below its record close from August 2025. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price fell to its lowest level in over three months this week. BTC is now up ~15% year-to-date and sits ~13% below its record close from earlier this month. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price dropped further this week, hitting its lowest level in over two months. ETH is now up ~16% year-to-date and is ~20% below its record close from August 2025. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. A logarithmic scale is used on the y-axis of this chart to better illustrate the relative percentage changes and long-term growth of these cryptocurrencies, as opposed to their absolute price fluctuations. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

With over 21,000 investors joining in and the price rising every single hour , smart money is flooding in, especially from Ethereum whales seeking a hedge and diversification play in a volatile market. The presale is nearing its final stage, and only early buyers can still claim a 50% bonus with the code PATRIOTS100X before it sells out. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale: Price Rising Hourly, No Dips, Massive FOMO MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered rare territory — a presale that rises every hour and shows no dips in momentum. The demand has been explosive, with thousands of new wallets joining daily. The project’s safe infrastructure, verified audits, and community-first model have made it one of the most trusted presales in 2025. As traders search for the best crypto presale with real traction, MAGACOIN’s growth curve continues to outpace earlier hits like PEPE. What’s different this time is with real DeFi utility , creating a token that’s fun but functional. With the final presale phase approaching, the bonus offer (PATRIOTS100X) gives early participants 50% extra tokens , but only for a short time. Once this round closes, prices are expected to list higher on both CEX and DEX exchanges , which have reportedly begun discussions with the project team. Every minute counts now — MAGACOIN’s hourly price ticks upward, making timing crucial for those who want to maximize entry before listings go live. The project’s pace suggests it could be the best altcoin to buy before 2025’s next bull run begins. Ethereum Whales Move Early — Seeking the Best Crypto Presale for Safety and Hedge Ethereum’s long-term holders have begun positioning early into MAGACOIN FINANCE, a move that many see as a signal of where smart capital is rotating. After recent market corrections across major assets like Bitcoin and XRP, institutional-sized wallets are now chasing new presale opportunities that offer both safety and growth. Ethereum remains one of the most established assets in crypto, but even large holders are diversifying into younger altcoins that combine meme energy with real DeFi use cases. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out — offering audit-backed security, transparent tokenomics, and a community-owned foundation. In times of uncertainty, whales prefer projects that show legitimacy and reliability. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers just that: Fully audited (HashEx completed, CertiK ongoing) KYC-verified team No tax on trades Clear, transparent tokenomics For many high-net-worth investors, this is the best crypto presale to buy now for both hedge and early upside , especially as the token trades under $0.0006 , a price analysts say could “cancel two zeros” in the next major rally. A Hidden Gem Under $0.0006 — New Chance After XRP and Ethereum For investors who missed Ethereum’s rise from double digits or XRP’s breakout years ago, MAGACOIN FINANCE feels like the new opportunity . It’s a hidden gem under $0.0006 , gathering serious whale attention and retail enthusiasm alike. Analysts tracking whale flows confirm growing wallet activity around the presale contract, reflecting early positioning before the final stage ends. MAGACOIN combines scarcity, safety, and smart token design , giving it a real shot at being one of the best crypto presales of this cycle. In a market full of uncertainty, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a safe haven , a project where participants can grow without constant fear of price dips or hidden risks. With its transparent setup, hourly price increase, and upcoming exchange listings, it is not just another meme coin — it’s a secure entry into the next major wave of digital assets.

53516810,611532,1761177628,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53516810.jpeg,Tether Mints Another 1B USDT – $7B in Stablecoins Issued Since The Crash,https://bitcoinist.com/tether-mints-1b-usdt-7b-in-stablecoins-issued-crash/,"Tether has just minted another 1 billion USDT, only hours ago, reigniting debate over stablecoin-driven liquidity flows across the crypto market. The mint comes at a crucial time — Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim higher levels after weeks of volatility, while altcoins continue to bleed as if a full-blown bear market were underway. These mints tend to inject liquidity into exchanges, providing the capital needed for traders and market makers to re-enter positions or stabilize volatile price swings. While not always an immediate bullish catalyst, they frequently precede recoveries in market sentiment and volume. The latest mint follows a wave of renewed uncertainty across the crypto landscape, with investors closely watching Bitcoin’s $110K level as a make-or-break support zone. Altcoins, meanwhile, are experiencing double-digit declines, raising concerns that risk appetite remains weak. If history is any indication, this new influx of stablecoin liquidity could be setting the stage for a short-term rebound — or at least a temporary relief rally — as liquidity begins to circulate across major exchanges and derivative markets in the days ahead. A Liquidity Wave That Could Shake the Market According to data from Lookonchain, Tether and Circle have collectively minted over $7 billion in stablecoins since the October 10 market crash. This surge in new supply marks one of the most significant liquidity injections since midyear, sparking speculation about its potential impact on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Stablecoin mints on this scale often act as precursors to major price swings. While not a direct form of buying, they indicate that fresh capital is being positioned to enter the market — typically through market makers, institutional desks, or exchanges preparing for renewed trading activity. In this context, the $7 billion influx suggests that liquidity conditions are improving after the sharp drawdown that liquidated billions in long positions earlier this month. Related Reading: 2,496 Bitcoin Moved After Years Of Inactivity – Long-Term Holders Take Action However, such rapid capital movement can also heighten volatility. As this liquidity begins to circulate, it can amplify both sides of the market — first triggering relief rallies as buyers re-enter, and then sharp corrections as leveraged positions unwind. For Bitcoin, the timing is especially critical. With BTC still struggling to hold above $108K–$110K, this new liquidity could determine whether the next move is a bullish breakout or another leg lower. Historically, large stablecoin issuances have preceded upward shifts in Bitcoin’s price, but in a fragile market, they can also fuel speculative whipsaws. Tether’s USDT Dominance Rebounds As Traders Seek Stability Tether’s market dominance has risen sharply to around 5.06%, signaling a notable shift in sentiment as investors move capital into stablecoins amid heightened market volatility. The weekly chart shows a strong rebound from the 4.6% level, with USDT dominance now testing resistance near the 100-week moving average. This uptick coincides with the broader crypto market downturn following Bitcoin’s failure to hold key support at $110K and widespread selling across altcoins. Historically, rising USDT dominance reflects increased demand for safety — traders exiting volatile assets and parking capital in stablecoins to wait for clearer market direction. This pattern often precedes periods of accumulation, as sidelined liquidity builds up, ready to re-enter once confidence returns. From a technical standpoint, the structure suggests that a sustained breakout above 5.2% could extend the dominance rally toward 6%, a level last seen during previous market corrections. However, rejection here would imply stabilization and potential capital rotation back into risk assets.

The figure was posted on his social feed. Based on reports, that user base would represent about 6.25% of the global population. At the same time, USDT’s circulating supply is reported to be roughly $182 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Goes Big — $255M Longs Opened Before Trump–China Summit Tether Reports 500 Million Users The announcement came in a short social post from Ardoino celebrating the milestone. It’s the “biggest financial inclusion achievement” in history, he said. The company frames this as a major step for financial access, pointing to broad use in markets where traditional banking is limited. The method used to count “users” has not been made public, and the figure appears to be self-reported by Tether. Tether USDT reached officially 500 million users! Likely the biggest financial inclusion achievement in history. https://t.co/jbmnMDwidi — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) October 21, 2025 Use Patterns In Emerging Markets In several emerging economies, market participants say stablecoins are used for more than trading. They are used for cross-border payments, local transfers, and as a quick store of value when local currencies fall in value. Based on reports, people and businesses often move money into USDT to avoid volatility in their own currencies. That practical use is part of why the company emphasizes the inclusion angle. Market Size And Supply Figures USDT’s reported $182 billion supply places it among the largest stablecoins in circulation. Analysts tracking on-chain data note that a large portion of stablecoin flows still occur on major blockchains and centralized exchanges. Verification And Counting Caveats The 500 million claim has raised questions from industry observers and some analysts. How a “user” is defined is unclear: It wasn’t fully disclosed in detail if it is a unique person, a wallet address, an account on a partner platform, or an aggregate of multiple identifiers. Reports emphasize that without detailed methodology, outside verification is limited. The number should be viewed as a company figure that signals scale, but not as an independently audited headcount.

If even a portion of the 500 million are new entrants to digital finance, that would be significant. Meanwhile, regulators in several jurisdictions are watching stablecoins more closely. That scrutiny could affect how stablecoins are used in payments and remittances going forward.

Attendees included Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Senator Chuck Schumer from New York. Other industry names like Kraken co-CEO David Ripley and Uniswap Labs’ Hayden Adams were present. Nazarov said this wasn’t the usual roundtable. “It was definitely some more senior senators speaking at once,” he said. “They realize the economic value of the industry is high, so they need to address how they are going to deal with it, they need to address it correctly.” Crypto industry demands answers Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov joined a dozen leaders in a nearly three-hour sit-down and two separate meetings, first with Democrats, then with Republicans. The first session, lasting about an hour and a half, included questions from Democratic lawmakers about decentralized finance and illicit use of crypto. Schumer joined briefly. Nazarov said the tone was serious, and that lawmakers seemed focused on figuring out how to engage with the space without losing control. The second meeting ran for just over an hour and was with Republican lawmakers. According to Nazarov, they were much more direct in their support. The central topic in both rooms was the same: the market-structure legislation, which was supposed to go to markup in late October. But with the federal government in shutdown mode, nothing’s moved. The bill aims to create rules that separate commodities from securities and assign clear roles to regulators. That’s critical for companies like Kraken and Coinbase, who want to know which agencies they’ll be dealing with and what compliance looks like. Right now, that clarity doesn’t exist. “The meeting was productive, with stakeholders providing feedback and reaffirming support for a bipartisan approach,” said Jeff Naft, spokesperson for the Senate Banking Committee’s Republican side. He also pushed Democrats to commit to a markup date and stop dragging their feet. Earlier this year, both parties managed to pass a stablecoin bill, which was signed by President Donald Trump in July. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The season will go live next week on October 28, featuring new maps, weapons, and tactical modes that expand the fast-paced combined arms combat the series is famous for. Based on the recently released trailer, Blackwell Fields, a new map, has been updated and set on an extensive air base in California. The landscape features oil wells, burning fields, and vast open spaces, ideal for massive battles that involve both ground and air vehicles. The map will debut with the season’s first phase, called Rogue Ops. EA confirms that Season One will release in three phases The first phase has also featured a new 4v4 tactical mode inspired by classics like Search and Destroy and Counter-Strike. The game allows only one life per round, making it critical for gamers to make decisions carefully. For teams to secure a win, they must either eliminate the enemy or capture a single objective point. Battlefield 6 Season One has maintained squad revives, adding an extra layer of coordination and teamwork. New kits and vehicles are also part of the latest release. Gamers can expect to wield the SOR-300 Carbine, the Mini Fix sniper rifle, the GGH-22 pistol, and equip new attachments like the Rail Cover and Low-Powered Variable Optic (LPVO). The game has also introduced a new armored personnel vehicle, which will boost defense and attack abilities across large maps. EA confirmed that Season One will open in three stages, each bringing fresh content towards the end of the year. The second phase, called California Resistance, will be released on November 18, with a new map named Eastwood. The new map features a dense battlefield inspired by Southern California’s upscale neighborhoods and golf courses. Based on the trailer, Eastwood’s map layout appears different from Blackwell Field’s open expanses. Gamers have a chance to move tanks and air vehicles within the suburban homes featuring golf carts and pools. Gamers can also engage in close-quarters firefights in hotels and country clubs. The second phase will also include the new Sabotage mode, an 8v8 limited-time experience where teams alternate between attacking and defending cargo objectives. Lastly, the third stage, called the Winter Offensive, will be released on December 9, introducing a winter-themed map. The map features an ice climbing axe melee weapon and a special limited-time event named Ice Lock. Battlefield 6 has sold over 7 million copies since launch Battlefield 6 sold over seven million copies within its first week of launch, marking one of the most successful launches in EA’s shooter portfolio. The publisher has maintained strong servers and focused on refining balance and regular patches for the Battlefield 6 series. Gaming communities have shown higher expectations as Battlefield 6 continues to evolve, blending massive warfare, detailed maps, and new tactical game modes. The publisher hopes to meet such expectations and establish the game as one of the defining multiplayer experiences of the decade. Cryptopolitan uncovered that copies of the upcoming game release for PS5 had already leaked, based on Reddit posts ahead of its official launch. Based on the posts shared on Reddit, the received copy had a PEGI rating, indicating that an unnamed European retailer sold it. The Reddit user confirmed that the servers were already online ahead of the expected official start on October 10. However, gamers who obtain earlier access usually lack online features until the official release. The disclosure signaled that EA may have already opened its servers for multiplayer testing and set up for the final pre-launch. The disc copy for the PS5 edition occupies 68GB, and it is also available on Xbox Series X. For Xbox Series S, there is a smaller version occupying only 39GB. Don’t just read crypto news.

This includes jet engines and laptops. A US official and three individuals who acquired information from US authorities noted that this move is in response to China’s recent decision to impose limitations on rare earth exports. Although this is not the only option being discussed, sources have highlighted that the proposed plan aligns with US President Donald Trump’s earlier warning this month regarding the blocking of the export of important software to the country by setting up restrictions on the global shipment of products that either utilize US software or were developed with it. Trump’s limitation plan under consideration raises controversy among individuals Trump shared a social media post dated October 10 stating that he would impose an additional 100% tariff on products shipped from China to the US. This was in addition to new export controls on all essential software, which is set to take effect by November 1. However, the president did not provide further information on the situation. This announcement heightened fear among personnel of US and Chinese technology companies. To allay these fears, credible sources have reported that there’s an excellent chance they won’t even happen. Still, two sources close to the situation acknowledged that the idea of these controls suggests that the Trump administration is considering escalating its existing conflict with China. Frightened by the impact of this trade war, some officials in the US government have called on the administration to consider a softer approach . Meanwhile, considering the intense nature of the situation, reporters reached out to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the White House to request that he comment on possible software restrictions on China. “I can confirm that everything is under consideration,” he asserted. Bessent further explained that if these export restrictions on products such as software, engines, or other items are implemented, they would likely be done in collaboration with their G7 partners. Interestingly, US stock markets experienced a drastic decline after Trump’s restriction announcement went viral, but analysts confirmed that they recovered some of their losses later. According to the reports, the S&P 500 ended the day down by 0.5%, and the Nasdaq was roughly 1% lower by the end of trading. Emily Kilcrease at the Center for a New American Security weighed in on the topic of discussion. She mentioned that software is a clear area where the US can apply pressure. However, according to her, enforcing such controls would be challenging and could harm US-based businesses. “You would hope they are only making threats that they plan to follow through on,” Kilcrease added. China pledges to retaliate against the US’s proposed plans with strong measures A Chinese embassy representative did not directly respond to the specifics of the US actions under consideration, but said that China firmly opposes the US imposing unilateral long-arm jurisdiction measures. The representative also pointed out that the Asian country warned it would take strong countermeasures to protect its legitimate rights and interests if the US insists on continuing with this plan, which they called a “wrong path.” In the meantime, one source with knowledge of the situation suggested that officials in the administration may announce plans to pressure China, without actually implementing these actions. Additionally, two other sources highlighted that more focused policy alternatives are being debated. Following debates about the scope of the proposed move, a source, which wished to remain anonymous, expressed that everything one can imagine is made with US software.

While XRP continues to hold a strong position in cross-border payments, its growth curve appears to be slowing as new DeFi-focused platforms rise to prominence. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as a top crypto to buy, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional investors. Currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM’s momentum signals growing confidence in its innovative ecosystem. Mutuum Finance is redefining decentralized lending, offering real utility potential that many legacy altcoins can’t match. XRP Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) fell hard in recent market volatility, losing more than 50% and printing out a large wick to about $1.25, setting what now looks like a false breakout below an important level of support. On the daily chart, from an Elliott Wave view, XRP appears to be finishing microwave 5 of primary wave C, which could again set up for the run at heavy support to see the token fall more than 30% from today’s levels. In the last year, XRP has developed an expanding flat (ABC/3-3-5) and the $2.4 level has been consistently both resistance and support, drawing significant volume. Most importantly, XRP’s low correlation to Bitcoin (BTC) is an ideal candidate for strategic trading. Traders are testing these pivotal levels for the possibility of a rebound or breakdown, and others are checking out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gaining interest for the upcoming cycle of markets in preparation, making it the best crypto to buy now. Mutuum Finance Exceeds Expectations Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most optimistic new DeFi coins. Its usage is increasing at a more rapid pace than initially anticipated, with over 17,340 investors in the presale alone, investing over $17.75 million. These figures put Mutuum Finance as the leading investment vehicle for anyone looking for a cryptocurrency with vast long-term value potential before the next bull run, earning its place as a top crypto to buy. One of the largest milestones for Mutuum Finance’s roadmap is launching its lending and borrowing protocol , which will occur soon. Version 1 (V1) will launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and feature a number of decentralized finance products including liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the Liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be integrated fully for borrowing and lending, creating early access for users in a secure, low-interest, and fully decentralized lending system. This accomplishment not only makes Mutuum Finance’s investment highly sought after but also makes it one of the most successful new crypto coin launches with enormous long-term growth potential. Community Participation in Daily Leaderboard MUTM leaderboard provides incentives for the biggest purchases of tokens in a 24-hour window, encouraging healthy community participation. Within the last 24 hours, the largest buyers spent $7,036 and $6,619 respectively, indicating increasing activity along with investor sentiment. The day’s top buyer gets rewarded with a $500 MUTM bonus. All users need to do is make at least one trade within a 24-hour window. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the best altcoins to keep an eye on this cycle. Phase 6 presale tokens are valued at $0.035, with more than 70% sold and $17.75 million raised from 17,340 investors. Daily leaderboard activity, along with $500 MUTM prizes, shows increasing community participation and investor sentiment. With its two-lending DeFi approach and upcoming V1 lending protocol on Sepolia Testnet, MUTM balances early-stage potential with actual utility. Investors who want high-growth crypto opportunities need to act now to lock up tokens before Phase 7, making MUTM a top crypto to buy for the current cycle.

53518744,611657,1761181207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53518744.jpeg,Technical Analysis Suggests XRP’s Playbook From 2017 Could Repeat In 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/xrps-2017-playbook-reappearing/,"Crypto analyst Steph has presented an interesting comparison between XRP’s 2017 bull run and its current 2025 market structure in a post on the social media platform X. The post, which was captured with “The $XRP playbook,” noted a repetition of its early accumulation phase that preceded its massive breakout eight years ago. The technical analysis places 2017’s surge beside the altcoin’s ongoing consolidation around the $2 price level, predicting that the cryptocurrency could be entering a familiar setup for another explosive rally. XRP Might Repeat The 2017 Blueprint XRP’s price action in the past few days has been defined by the cryptocurrency looking to break past $2.5. This move comes off the back of a flash crash last week, which caused the altcoin’s price to create a strong downside wick on the daily timeframe. This downside wick, on the other hand, was a quick break to the downside amidst an its price consolidation that has been dragging on since July. Interestingly, dialing the price action many years back shows XRP has played out a similar pattern like this before. Back in 2017, the token spent months trading sideways before springing into an extraordinary vertical rally that turned it into one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies of that bull cycle. This trend, which was also noted in a technical analysis post by STEPH IS CRYPTO on X, looks at the possibility of the token repeating this rally again. The left side of Steph’s chart captures the 2017 price action vividly: a slow accumulation in early March followed by an almost parabolic ascent that pushed the price from fractions of a cent to above $3 within months. The chart highlights how the upward curvature that began around February 2017 served as the launchpad for XRP’s historic surge. By framing this as the “playbook,” Steph implies that history could be on the verge of rhyming once more. 2025 Setup: The Calm Before The Storm The right side of the chart image above shows XRP’s 2025 daily chart mirroring that 2017 accumulation curve. The token has been oscillating around mid $2 to form what looks like a rounded bottom pattern. The annotation points to November/December as the potential turning point. Steph’s projected path shows the token consolidating between $2.5 and $3 for the next few weeks before entering a strong vertical climb. The projection shows XRP breaking above $3 and then going on a climb that takes it far above its current price levels. The projection line on the chart extends toward $24. This means if the 2017-style pattern repeats, the altcoin could experience an unprecedented price appreciation that brings its new price range above $20. Steph isn’t the first analyst to look at similarities to the playbook in 2017. A similar outlook from a crypto analyst known as ChartNerd predicted a breakout to $13.5 if XRP repeats the 2017 rally.",XRP|ChartNerd|ripple|Steph|Steph is Crypto|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 01:00:07

Bulls Hold $2.38 Support As Breakout Pressure Builds,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-bounce-in-sight/,"XRP is holding firm above the $2.38 support level after a recent pullback, suggesting that bulls may still have control. As buying pressure builds, traders are watching closely for a potential breakout that could reignite bullish momentum in the coming sessions. Early Strength Fades After Hitting $2.52 Umair Crypto, in his latest market update, noted that XRP displayed initial strength after rebounding cleanly from the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The price managed to climb to around $2.52 with a solid close on the 4-hour chart, signaling renewed buyer interest and a potential shift in short-term momentum. Related Reading: XRP Price Coils Below Resistance — Bulls Prepare For Possible Upside Explosion However, that early optimism was short-lived as XRP’s upward push lost steam before even reaching the 100-day SMA. The failure to extend higher has started to reveal some underlying weakness in the chart, with bulls struggling to sustain momentum at higher levels. Umair emphasized that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) trendline now plays a crucial role in determining the next direction. A confirmed breakdown below this RSI trendline could lead to another lower low, effectively continuing the current local downtrend and reinforcing bearish sentiment in the market. For now, the situation remains uncertain. XRP must hold firmly above the $2.38 support level and maintain strength along the RSI trendline. However, a failure to do so could expose XRP to deeper downside risks in the short term. Momentum Or Pause? The Decisive Moment For XRP MakroVision Research highlighted that XRP successfully halted its steep decline within the lower Golden Pocket region, between approximately $1.40 and $1.55, and has recovered as buying pressure resurfaced. In the short term, the firm noted that XRP is now approaching a key resistance range between $2.48 and $2.65. Related Reading: XRP Charts Telling A Tale: Q4 Setup Mirrors 2017 Bullish Breakout, Time To Buy? A failure to break above this zone could lead to temporary consolidation as the market gathers momentum for its next move. On the downside, the $1.96 level remains a critical support area, as losing it could reintroduce downside pressure. From an upside perspective, a decisive and sustained breakout above $2.65 could open the door for further gains toward $3.06. According to MakroVision Research, only a move beyond this level would confirm renewed bullish strength and restore clear upward momentum across the broader trend. In conclusion, the analyst emphasized that XRP’s precise targeting of the Golden Pocket and its swift recovery show that buyers are still active and defending key zones. However, the next major test lies in whether the bulls can generate enough momentum to overcome the $2.65 resistance and set the stage for a broader rally.

The CMA stated that platforms, including Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android, were widely used by millions of businesses and consumers. Still, it noted, rules such as the ones employed in their app stores might be “limiting innovation and competition”. According to the regulator, it found that the firms’ mobile platforms, which include operating systems and browsers on both smartphones and tablets, held a position of “strategic significance” in the market, with most UK mobile device holders being either Apple or Android users. The CMA, tasked by the government to stimulate economic growth, stated that it was following the lead of the United States, certain European countries, and Japan in targeting the two tech giants. Apple and Google push back as UK regulator weighs tougher competition rules Google, however, remarked that the CMA’s upcoming actions would reveal whether it was truly fostering competition. At the same time, Apple cautioned against following the EU’s interventionist approach, which it claimed had weakened user privacy. In the UK, nearly all smartphones operate on either Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android systems, with their app stores and browsers holding dominant or exclusive positions on their respective platforms. The CMA has previously noted that this dominance allows the two tech giants to wield significant control over digital content, services, and innovation. The regulator clarified that its decision did not imply any wrongdoing or impose immediate obligations but signaled its intent to consider “proportionate, targeted interventions” to enhance competition. Google, which earlier this month became the first company to receive a Strategic Market Status (SMS) designation for its search business, described the move as “disappointing, disproportionate, and unwarranted.” “The CMA’s next steps will be crucial if the UK’s digital markets regime is to meet its promise of being pro-growth and pro-innovation,” Google’s senior competition director Oliver Bethell said in a blog post. Apple stated that it “worked tirelessly” to create the best products, services, and user experience, and noted that Britain risked undermining this effort, potentially leading to weaker privacy and security, as well as delayed access to new features. “We’ve seen the impact of regulation on Apple users in the EU, and we urge the UK not to follow the same path.” Just recently, the iPhone maker went to court in Luxembourg to launch a legal challenge against the EU’s Digital Markets Act , a forerunner to the UK’s new tech competition rules that came into force in January. The tech firm is opposed to the DMA’s changes to its App Store and how iPhones interact with wireless accessories from other manufacturers, such as headphones. The investigations arrived at a challenging time for the CMA, which is trying to implement the new digital markets laws without being perceived as overly hostile to business. Experts urge CMA to balance fair competition with investment-friendly policies According to Tom Smith, a competition lawyer at Geradin Partners and a former CMA director, the CMA could now allow app developers to operate with greater ease, enabling them to inform customers about cheaper deals. “This is something that has already been adopted in the US, so it should not be a controversial measure,” he said. Matthew Sinclair, the senior director of trade body CCIA, noted, however, that the “opaque” designation process would cause significant uncertainty for firms innovating and investing in the UK. Sinclair continued to emphasize that it is essential for the CMA to adopt a conservative approach when considering conduct requirements and respond to the clear steer from ministers to promote investment and growth.

The initiative aims to enable BNB Chain users to participate in the world’s active prediction market directly on BSC (BNB Smart Chain). BNB Chain announced that the integration with Polymarket will enable users to deposit BNB or stablecoins on BSC and begin trading instantly. The integration will also not require complex bridging or any manual transfers between BNB Chain and Polymarket. Polymarket integrates other blockchains into its platform BNB Chain 🤝 Polymarket @Polymarket now supports direct deposits from BNB Smart Chain, letting users trade on real-world events instantly with BNB or stablecoins. 🔗 https://t.co/o9b33LUHA5 More on the news 👇 pic.twitter.com/iMrhswfATx — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) October 22, 2025 Polymarket acknowledged that the initiative showed the expansion of real-world utility for BNB Chain users. The firm confirmed that the integration of the deposit function provides BNB Chain users with direct access to its diverse markets and liquidity, allowing them to participate in on-chain predictions without leaving the BNB ecosystem. The predictions platform confirmed that the launch focuses on new BNB-themed markets, including whether BNB reaches an all-time high by the end of the year, or if BNB hits $1,500 by the end of the year. Polymarket said the markets invite the community to express its views with real stakes. The firm argued that the price-based forecasts will offer live sentiment signals for the BNB ecosystem as liquidity grows. Polymarket believes that the initiative opens new ground for builders and users alike. The firm argued that the integration connects BNB users to Polymarket’s market environment, helping BNB Chain continue to grow as the center of real-world utility and innovation. The integration comes as Polymarket rolled out deposits and withdrawals via Hyperliquid on October 15. The firm stated that the initiative enables users to transfer funds between the two platforms, providing faster liquidity access for prediction market trading. Polymarket acknowledged that Hyperliquid’s high-speed infrastructure, which handles about 100,000 orders per second, complements its on-chain betting. The company also said the integration will have no bridging delays and leverages Hyperliquid’s fee structure, which avoids high Polygon or Ethereum gas fees. Earlier this month, Polymarket also enabled Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals. The initiative followed BTC’s surge to a fresh all-time high above $126,000. The predictions platform already supports deposits in a variety of tokens across Polygon, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, and Solana. On October 13, MetaMask also partnered with Polymarket to integrate the prediction market platform directly into its wallet app. Although the integration will launch later this year, it will enable MetaMask users to buy and sell shares in prediction markets directly within the self-custodial interface. MetaMask announced that the integration will be available in most regions, including the U.S., the UK, Singapore, France, Thailand, Poland, Australia, Belgium, Taiwan, and Canada. The firm believes that the initiative supercharges Polymarket’s ecosystem, with Hyperliquid boosting on-ramp speed, while MetaMask’s over 30 million monthly users drive mainstream adoption. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s digital identity project, Worldcoin, also announced its integration into Polymarket on Tuesday. World stated that its users can download and access the new Mini App in countries where the prediction platform’s services are allowed. The launch of the Mini App on World enables World App users to participate in prediction markets using two crypto assets, USDC and Worldcoin. World also said the eligibility of Worldcoin tokens is restricted based on geography, age, and other factors. Prediction markets hit a new all-time high in trading volume The integrations come as the trading volume on prediction markets surged to new all-time highs of $2 billion on Monday. According to data from Dune, Polymarket accounted for roughly 52.3% ($1 billion) of total volume, while its rival, Kalshi, recorded about 47% ($950 million). On-chain data also revealed that Kalshi has been outperforming its competitor for eight consecutive weeks. Kalshi, the first federally regulated prediction market platform in the U.S., surpassed Polymarket in trading volume for the first time in August. The prediction platform also began beta testing its U.S. app earlier this month, in preparation for reentering the U.S. market.

He posted on Truth Social that the CEOs told him the tariffs made their stocks “soar” and saved U.S. automakers from what they described as a “hard, long slog” in the market. The new 25% import duty will take effect on November 1, but it’s already making noise across the auto industry. The announcement sent traders rushing into auto stocks, with GM shares up 14% in early Tuesday trading and now sitting 24% higher for the year, nearly 35% up in the past twelve months. Trump wrote that the tariff strategy was meant to push foreign truck makers to build more in the U.S., adding that it was working faster than expected. GM raises prices and trims losses as tariffs hit profits Inside GM, the focus is on surviving the higher costs and turning the tariffs into a financial advantage. Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told Yahoo Finance that “tariffs are getting a little bit better,” and that Wall Street should understand “it’s stabilized.” He said the company started the year surrounded by tariff noise but stayed confident it could “adjust and work through it.” Jacobson said GM is relying on its “track record” of resilience, pointing out how the company made it through the pandemic and the global semiconductor shortage. He added, “Now we’re on track to be able to lean on that record and look to a 2026 that could be better than 2025.” He also said the Trump administration wants the U.S. auto industry to be successful, citing recent trade progress with South Korea and potential relief talks involving Mexico and Canada. GM now estimates tariffs will cut $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion from profits this year, less than its earlier forecast of up to $5 billion. The company expects new tariff revisions to ease the hit, with savings expected to show up by the fourth quarter. GM also said cost cuts will offset part of the damage. To keep margins steady, GM has been raising prices on its trucks and SUVs, saying it finds “opportunities to add content and create value for the consumer” each time it updates a model. Jacobson said GM is seeing “strong demand” for full-size SUVs and trucks, allowing the automaker to tweak pricing and production to keep revenue flowing despite the tariffs. The result has been a stronger performance from its most profitable vehicles, even as component costs rise. Ford faces recall wave and factory delays after plant fire While GM works to stabilize its margins, Ford has been struggling with a wave of recalls and a supply disruption that’s affecting production lines. Ford is recalling 1,448,655 vehicles due to a rearview camera problem that can cause distorted or blank images when drivers reverse. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the defect increases the risk of a crash. This follows earlier recalls of 290,000 vehicles this month over similar issues with Ford’s 360-degree camera systems in certain lighting conditions. Earlier this year, Ford also recalled 1.1 million Ford and Lincoln vehicles in May and another 200,000 in July for related camera malfunctions. The problems pile onto Ford’s production delays triggered by a three-alarm fire last month at an aluminum plant in New York, which forced the facility to shut down until early next year. The plant supplies metal for Ford’s Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, both high-margin models. The production halt has also disrupted supply chains for Jeep SUVs, which rely on the same aluminum supplier. According to an internal memo allegedly obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Ford extended the pause on assembly of the Expedition and Navigator at its Kentucky Truck Plant through October 26. Factory workers said output of the F-Series Super Duty trucks, which can sell for over $100,000 each, has also been trimmed to manage shortages. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This major accumulation wave has reignited investor curiosity and fueled talk about whether Dogecoin could deliver a 5x potential move before the year ends. While the spotlight shines on DOGE, a fresh name — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is turning heads with its HashEx-certified safety, growing community, and a limited-time 50% bonus for early adopters. Whale Moves Signal Growing Conviction Among Big Players Recent whale accumulation has stunned traders — over 120 million DOGE were purchased in a short span. This marks one of the largest Dogecoin whale accumulation phases of the year, according to blockchain data trackers. Analyst Ali Martinez posted on X : “10.50 billion $DOGE were accumulated at $0.21. That’s a big resistance zone forming. Keep this level on your radar!” Analyst Don echoed the sentiment: “The chart is telling us in the next few days, some kind of big news should come out for $DOGE.” This heavy buying came while retail traders remained cautious. Institutional wallets quietly soaked up DOGE during price dips — a pattern that has often preceded strong upside swings in past cycles. Many analysts see this as a strong indicator of confidence in the DOGE long-term forecast . Moreover, data shows that these whale addresses tend to hold for extended periods, often acting as market stabilizers during volatile conditions. If these whales continue adding to their positions, it may push DOGE toward a stronger Dogecoin market outlook heading into Q4. DOGE Price Prediction 2025 — Analysts Expect Momentum to Build The latest technical readings paint a mixed but promising picture for Dogecoin’s near-term price path. Several analysts expect the coin to regain momentum in the coming months, with some even predicting DOGE 5x potential gains. Kaleo , a well-known X trader, noted: “Dogecoin is expecting a swift reclaim of $0.25 soon. There’s A LOT of thin air to fill from the market nuke a couple weeks back.” Cantonese Cat added: “DOGE is having a hard time breaking above 0.886. It’s not ready to be incredibly bullish yet, but it’s close. Expect another challenge at 0.886 in Q4 2025.” DOGE price analysis The mix of whale accumulation and strong support around $0.21 has built a sturdy base. If DOGE can break through resistance levels, analysts believe it could easily climb to higher price zones, reviving talk of the best crypto to buy now among large-cap meme coins. DOGE price prediction 2025 models point toward a gradual rally, supported by renewed interest in meme coins and the foundation’s latest moves — including the Dogecoin Foundation’s acquisition of a controlling stake in the Italian soccer club U.S. Triestina Calcio 1918. This bold expansion has widened Dogecoin’s visibility, merging crypto enthusiasm with real-world influence. With such strategic steps and strong whale activity, Dogecoin whale activity 2025 could drive the next leg of growth as part of the top altcoins for 2025 bull run narrative.

Rather than relying on multiple indicators, he focuses on a single chart tracking short-term holder net unrealized profit and loss (NUPL), suggesting that this data alone may offer significant insight into whether XRP is at or near a market bottom. #XRP PRICE PREDICTION (EVERYTHING JUST CHANGED!) pic.twitter.com/UzV0J5vKp9 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 20, 2025 Understanding the Indicator The chart presented compares XRP’s price ( a black line) to the short-term holder NUPL ratio (a colored line). When this colored line drops into the capitulation zone—marked in red—it signifies that short-term holders are selling at a loss. According to the analyst, historically, such moments have aligned with key market bottoms. He restricts the analysis to data from October 2024 onward, underscoring one year of price action and investor behavior. In October 2024, XRP was trading around $0.50. At that time, the NUPL ratio moved into capitulation territory. While the price did not immediately reverse, those who entered during that phase reportedly saw strong gains weeks later, as XRP rose to nearly $4. This pattern, he argues, is consistent and has been repeated multiple times. Historical Examples of Capitulation and Recovery The analyst identifies March 2025 as another pivotal moment. XRP, trading below $2, dipped again into capitulation. Following this, the price advanced toward the $3 range. A similar scenario unfolded in June 2025, when XRP declined to near $2, prompting another capitulation event among short-term holders. Shortly after, the market recovered to approximately $3.40 to $3.50. These repeated instances form the basis of his case: capitulation from short-term holders has historically aligned with optimal buying zones rather than moments of further decline. Each of the cited periods exhibited temporary fear, followed by a substantial upside within a relatively short timeframe. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Current Market Position and Analyst’s Outlook Currently, the NUPL ratio has fallen to approximately -0.2, which he notes is potentially the lowest reading ever recorded for XRP under this metric. This is even deeper than the October 2024 levels, which only approached -0.1. The analyst describes this as a stronger capitulation than previous cycles, indicating heightened fear and more severe losses among recent market participants. He stresses that such conditions, while uncomfortable, have regularly marked the final phase of downward pressure. In his view, exiting at this stage would be ill-timed, as history suggests this zone precedes recovery. He urges viewers to avoid emotional decision-making and instead focus on empirical data. Final Perspective StephIsCrypto concludes that the market may be positioned at or very near a bottom based on this indicator alone. While acknowledging broader uncertainty, he maintains that deeply negative NUPL readings convey opportunity rather than risk. Although he briefly mentions available trading platforms, the core message remains centered on the chart’s implications: panic selling has historically favored those willing to take the opposite position. The analysis ultimately frames the present environment not as a signal to retreat, but as a phase warranting attention to data rather than sentiment.

This was after the tech giant shifted the standard from two-day to same-day and even one-hour delivery. Currently, Amazon aims to save precious seconds on each delivery with robots, AI, and new eyewear assistance. Amazon’s commitment to accelerating the delivery process with its advanced glasses After reports leaked that Amazon was developing advanced glasses last year, the tech company showcased the glasses for delivery workers for the first time this week. Internally known as Amelia, these glasses feature a small screen that provides turn-by-turn directions, scans package codes, and takes photos to confirm deliveries. Considering the unique features, analysts mentioned that the tech giant’s glasses might replace the big handheld GPS devices that drivers currently use. Additionally, they noted that these glasses can provide individuals with useful navigation advice, such as suggesting which way to turn when exiting an apartment elevator or even ways to avoid an aggressive dog at a client’s house. To work effectively, sources familiar with the situation pointed out that Amazon’s advanced glasses connect to a controller attached to a driver’s vest. Meanwhile, the tech company revealed its designed swappable battery packs to solve battery life challenges. This announcement was made at Amazon’s yearly “Delivering the Future” logistics event. Notably, this event aimed to enhance the “last 100 yards” of delivery, which the company highlighted as typically the most expensive part of getting packages to customers. To illustrate its dedication to accelerating the delivery process, reports from reliable sources indicate that Amazon launched a delivery van scanner last year, which made work easier for drivers. According to these reports, the van scanner enabled drivers to identify packages at each stop by shining a green light on them, thereby saving the time that drivers would otherwise waste reading labels. Apart from this innovation, the sources also noted that the tech giant presented new digital maps to reporters in June of this year. These digital maps provide more detailed information about neighborhoods, building shapes, and obstacles compared to Google Maps. Beryl Tomay acknowledges the effectiveness of Amazon’s advanced glasses Beryl Tomay, Amazon’s Vice President of Transportation, mentioned that several drivers had already tested the advanced glasses on their routes. Following their feedback on Amazon’s advanced glasses, Tomay stated that the eyeglasses reduce the need to simultaneously handle both a phone and a package. She explained that they keep the driver focused, hence improving their safety. Hence, according to her, some drivers have saved up to 30 minutes in their shifts since news of the maneuver has spread. Tomay also noted that drivers and their contracted firms will not be forced to use smart glasses. Additionally, she mentioned that the company plans to give out the smart glasses for free to those who opt to use them. However, Tomay cautioned that the glasses remain experimental and Amazon’s plans for them have not yet been finalized. To make work easier, the online store recently announced the launch of a robotic arm that it said would help warehouse workers pick items from shelves and organize them, thereby speeding up and improving the accuracy of order delivery. Amazon said the Blue Jay robot can reduce injury rates and operate in a more compact space than older robots, which typically require three separate stations. In related events, Amazon’s glasses launch coincides with Samsung’s unveiling of the Galaxy XR . The South Korean multinational manufacturing conglomerate is the latest to take on the category with the Galaxy XR. Samsung began selling it on Tuesday night for $1,800, about half the price of Apple’s Vision Pro. Those who buy the new gadget early will also receive a suite of digital freebies, including free access to the paid version of Google’s Gemini AI assistant and YouTube Premium for a year. The headset was made in collaboration with Google for the software and Qualcomm, which makes the chip powering the Galaxy XR. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Rowe Price moves into crypto with new active ETF plan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/t-rowe-price-files-for-crypto-etf/,"T. Rowe Price has filed with the SEC to launch a crypto ETF that will allow investors to invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The ETF will be an actively managed fund that aims to outperform the FTSE Crypto U.S. Listed Index. If approved, it will trade on the NYSE Arca under a ticker symbol that has yet to be announced. T. Rowe Price moves into crypto with new active ETF plan T. Rowe Price manages $1.77 trillion in assets and has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create its first Active Crypto Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The filing states that the fund will hold 5 – 15 different digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Litecoin (LTC). The company said this number may change depending on market conditions. The Active Crypto ETF will only hold “eligible assets” to stay within clear legal boundaries and comply with SEC rules, thereby avoiding the legal issues that have affected other crypto projects in recent years. The fund will also maintain a portion of its assets in cash, stablecoins, or short-term safe investments, such as bank deposits, to ensure it always has sufficient liquid funds for expenses. T. Rowe Price Sponsor LLC will manage the fund’s operations, trading decisions, and long-term strategy. At the same time, CSC Delaware Trust Company will act as the trustee to ensure that its activities comply with the rules. T. Rowe Price Associates will handle accounting, record keeping, and reporting. Another interesting point in the filing is that the fund may include staking in the future if regulators allow it. The ETF could generate additional income for investors and support the network’s operations. However, the company stated that it will only move forward once U.S. regulators provide clear guidance and rules on staking. The Active Crypto ETF will have experts as managers who will monitor price trends, market activity, and long-term growth of each coin to determine the optimal time to buy, sell, or adjust the fund’s position. Rising investor demand pushes major firms to add crypto funds Companies like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have launched Bitcoin ETFs , bringing in more than $150 billion in investments in just a few months. The SEC also approved Ethereum ETFs later in the same year, and these attracted $23 billion in assets in just a few months. T. Rowe Price is following the lead of popular financial companies like Fidelity, VanEck, and ProShares, which have also expanded into crypto investments. ProShares, for example, recently filed for its own mixed digital coin fund that will hold several cryptocurrencies instead of just one. The SEC is currently reviewing over 90 applications for different types of crypto ETFs. Some focus on single coins, such as Solana, while others, like the T. Rowe Price proposal, include multiple digital assets in a single fund. Analysts say all these applications prove just how optimistic investors are about the future of crypto regulation in the United States. T. Rowe Price did not make any comments, but this move demonstrates how much financial institutions now view crypto as a genuine investment opportunity.

Notably, stablecoin reserves on leading crypto exchanges like Binance are entering all-time high (ATH) territory, hinting at a potential rally for BTC. Stablecoin Reserves Rise – Will Bitcoin Benefit? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor PelinayPA, Binance stablecoin reserves are approaching ATH levels, indicating that investors are ready to deploy funds to accumulate BTC at current or lower levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters ‘Disbelief Phase’ – Could Short Sellers Face The Next Squeeze? The CryptoQuant analyst highlighted the rapidly falling Bitcoin-Stablecoin Ratio (ESR). For the uninitiated, the ESR measures the proportion of Bitcoin reserves to stablecoin reserves on exchanges like Binance. The ratio also gives hints about the market’s potential buying power and selling pressure. Past data shows that whenever the ESR falls sharply during market volatility, BTC’s price tends to surge. Essentially, a declining ESR means that stablecoin reserves are growing in comparison to BTC reserves on exchanges. This shows an increase in available “dry powder” on exchanges, which can quickly be used to buy more BTC and initiate another bull rally. Conversely, when the ESR rises, it means that stablecoin reserves are falling while BTC supply on exchanges is increasing. This points toward an increase in short-term selling pressure as traders deposit BTC to exchanges to sell. Currently, the ESR has fallen to historically low levels, implying that Binance holds relatively large stablecoin reserves compared to BTC reserves. According to PelinayPA, such a setup can have two interpretations: In a positive scenario, the abundance of stablecoins suggests significant latent buying power. If market confidence returns, this could trigger a strong wave of buying pressure and mark the start of a new bullish phase. Meanwhile, the negative scenario assumes that this liquidity would remain inactive, reflecting investor hesitation and a market in standby mode after the recent bloodbath that resulted in liquidations worth $19 billion. Will The Gold Rotation Help BTC? Following the crypto market crash earlier this month, which sent BTC from an ATH of more than $126,000 all the way down to $102,000, several whales faced liquidations. Despite the crash, some analysts are confident that the BTC top is not in yet. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Are Back: Three Indicators Suggest A Run Toward $130,000 One of the factors that can significantly benefit BTC in the near term is the capital rotation from gold to the digital asset. In a new report, Bitwise predicted that capital rotation from gold into BTC could propel it to $242,000. That said, veteran trader Peter Brandt recently forecasted that BTC could crash 50% from current price levels. At press time, BTC trades at $108,268, down 0.3% in the past 24 hours.

After weeks of volatile price action, the market’s recovery attempts are being met with heavy resistance, with BTC still trading below key psychological levels. According to data from Lookonchain, the well-known trader known as the BitcoinOG (1011short) — famous for shorting the market during the October 10 crash — is once again making headlines. On-chain data shows that the whale has started dumping BTC, triggering renewed anxiety among traders and investors. This move has reignited debate across the community, as many analysts consider this trader part of the so-called “smart money” cohort — entities known for anticipating market shifts with high precision. While some interpret the whale’s activity as a sign of further downside ahead, others argue that such events often mark capitulation points where the market absorbs final waves of selling before rebounding. With uncertainty rising and liquidity thin, Bitcoin’s next moves will be crucial in determining short-term sentiment. The coming days could decide whether this whale’s actions confirm another leg down — or signal the last shakeout before a broader recovery phase. Whale Activity Intensifies: The BitcoinOG Moves Millions Across Exchanges According to Lookonchain insights , the BitcoinOG (1011short) — the trader who famously shorted the market during the October 10 crash — is once again making major moves. Since the market downturn, this whale has deposited 5,252 BTC, worth approximately $587.88 million, into major exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, and Hyperliquid. At the same time, data shows his short position on Hyperliquid has grown to 2,100 BTC, valued at around $227.8 million. This scale of activity has drawn intense attention from analysts, given the trader’s historical accuracy in predicting market tops. Depositing Bitcoin to exchanges often signals potential selling or hedging behavior, adding to the bearish tone currently dominating sentiment. Combined with the expansion of his short exposure, it suggests the whale could be positioning for further downside or protecting gains from earlier market moves. However, several experts have urged caution in overinterpreting these transactions. On-chain visibility only provides a partial view — these may be just a fraction of the whale’s total holdings or broader strategy. It’s possible that some positions remain hidden across other derivatives platforms, wallets, or over-the-counter deals. This uncertainty makes the whale’s behavior both intriguing and concerning. While retail traders often react strongly to such visible movements, seasoned analysts emphasize the need for broader context — including derivatives data, funding rates, and liquidity shifts. Weekly Chart: Support Retest as Market Faces Key Inflection Point The weekly Bitcoin chart shows the market struggling to hold above the $108,000 region, a critical short-term support level that aligns closely with the 50-week moving average (blue line). After the sharp drop following the October 10 crash, BTC attempted a rebound but failed to sustain momentum above $114,000, signaling persistent selling pressure near the $117,500 resistance — a level that has acted as both support and resistance multiple times over the past year. The structure now suggests Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase within a broader bullish trend, but downside risks remain elevated. If the 50-week moving average fails to hold, the next potential support lies near $100,000, which aligns with the lower range of historical demand and the March 2025 breakout zone. A break below this region could accelerate selling momentum and confirm a deeper retracement. Conversely, reclaiming $117,500 would signal renewed strength, opening the door for a potential retest of the $125,000–$130,000 range. Overall, Bitcoin’s weekly structure remains cautiously bullish, but sustained weakness around current levels would put the broader uptrend at risk — making the coming weeks decisive for long-term direction.

The conversation began after developer Vincent Van Code suggested that Ripple’s primary objective has always been tied to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and its native token, rather than to side ventures such as stablecoins or cross-border payment products. When will everyone just accept that Ripple endgame has ALWAYS been XRPL and XRP. Not stablecoins, not cross border, just establishing a global liquidity on chain, using XRP, #TheLiquidityTokenXRP — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 20, 2025 Analysts Argue Ripple’s Strategy Relies on XRP Growth According to Van Code, the company’s broader vision is to establish global on-chain liquidity powered by the XRPL, positioning XRP as the foundation for large-scale financial transactions. His comments reignited a long-standing belief among some investors that Ripple’s business model is directly dependent on XRP’s valuation. XRP proponent Digital Asset Investor reinforced this view, stating that the company’s success is inseparable from the eventual appreciation of XRP. While Ripple has consistently avoided making public projections about the token’s price, he argued that its financial structure leaves little doubt about the importance of a stronger XRP market. Ripple’s reticence on price-related discussions is widely interpreted as a regulatory safeguard, particularly given its history of legal disputes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, the firm’s substantial XRP holdings, about 35 billion in escrow and an additional 5.01 billion readily available, clearly tie its financial health to the token’s value. At the current trading price of roughly $2.40 , every $1 increase would theoretically add around $40 billion to Ripple’s balance sheet. Community Divided Over Ripple’s Direction Despite these perspectives, not everyone within the XRP ecosystem agrees that Ripple’s strategy revolves around XRP’s price. Some critics argue that recent decisions contradict the company’s stated commitment to its own blockchain. For instance, a well-known community member, Fishy Catfish, questioned why Ripple issued nearly 90% of its RLUSD stablecoin supply on Ethereum rather than the XRPL. Data from CryptoQuant supports this observation. It shows that only 92.5 million RLUSD reside on the XRPL, while the total supply nears 900 million. The move has led some to interpret Ripple’s strategy as a vote of no confidence in its native network. “Not even Ripple wants to use XRP or XRPL,” Catfish remarked, describing the chain as outdated and underused. Meanwhile, other users maintain that XRP has always been intended as a bridge asset for cross-border liquidity solutions, a mission Ripple has championed since its inception. They question whether the company’s new initiatives signal a shift away from that original focus. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Quiet Endgame Still Centers on XRP Despite internal disagreements, market observers highlight Ripple’s continuous efforts to integrate XRP into institutional systems. Ongoing partnerships with firms such as GTreasury , Evernorth , and Japan’s SBI Holdings illustrate that the company is still expanding practical use cases for the token. In addition, Ripple is reportedly supporting initiatives to establish a major public XRP treasury , a long-term accumulation strategy designed to mirror how other firms have driven value appreciation through controlled supply growth. Although Ripple avoids explicitly connecting its success to XRP’s price movements, most analysts agree that the two remain closely aligned. As the company deepens its presence in institutional finance and continues to build liquidity infrastructure around the XRPL, community members see growing evidence that the company’s ultimate objective is inseparable from the value of XRP itself.

Bitcoin leads the rebound, joined by altcoins like XRP , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) — and MAGACOIN FINANCE , now drawing whale attention as buyers prepare for a major Q4 rally. Bitcoin Bounces Back After $19B Crash After a record $19 billion liquidation on October 10, Bitcoin’s drop to $104,000 caught many off guard. But Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick now says the shakeout may have cleared the path for a major rally. He believes Bitcoin could rise to $200,000 by year-end if ETF inflows keep growing and the U.S. Federal Reserve continues easing rates. Kendrick told Cointelegraph that even in a weaker market case, Bitcoin could close “well north of $150,000” before December ends. He added that ETF inflows are already recovering, with $477 million in net positives this week alone, signaling renewed demand from institutional players. This bounce marks what many traders see as a second accumulation phase. With gold also reaching new highs, Bitcoin is regaining its safe-haven appeal. Many analysts now list it as the best crypto to buy for November , especially for those seeking a rebound play after the crash. XRP Price Outlook Turns Up After Sharp Drop XRP’s recent price drop hit harder than most. During the October 10 flash crash, XRP fell as low as $0.77 on Binance , marking a 72% daily plunge. But some analysts now think this correction could set the stage for a strong recovery. Crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo told his 700,000 followers on X that XRP’s setup looks similar to late 2017, when a flash crash on Binance preceded its legendary run to $3.3. He believes XRP “could send from here,” noting how the coin bounced from a long-term descending trendline. XRP currently trades under $2.5 but continues to attract attention from retail buyers and whales waiting for a clean breakout. With renewed buying pressure and historic patterns aligning, many are placing XRP among the best crypto to buy for November , expecting it to mirror previous recovery cycles. Cardano Shows Signs of a 333% Rebound Cardano (ADA) remains in focus for long-term investors. Despite price drops since early October, analysts see a clear uptrend forming. Market watcher Javon Marks said ADA has kept its breakout structure intact, which could pave the way for another large rally. Marks projects a 333% rally to $2.96 , noting that ADA has consistently made higher highs and higher lows since 2023. Even its recent dip to $0.279 didn’t break key levels. Other analysts like Chris O forecast a run to as high as $5–$8 this cycle if sentiment strengthens. Cardano’s stability amid market turbulence gives it an edge for recovery portfolios. Its consistent development and committed user base make ADA one of the best crypto picks for November , especially for those diversifying beyond Bitcoin and XRP. Chainlink Positioned for Institutional Growth Chainlink (LINK) trades around $17.52 after a brief pullback, but institutional activity hints at bigger moves ahead. Grayscale and Bitwise have filed to launch Chainlink ETFs on NYSE Arca — a move that could open new channels for traditional investors to enter the asset. Whales also remain active around the $16 price zone, buying more than 54 million LINK tokens in October. This buying zone may act as a base for the next run, especially with exchange reserves falling by 33 million LINK since July. Chainlink continues to lead in real-world asset (RWA) integration, working with S&P Global, SWIFT, and ICE. Its growing relevance in decentralized data systems keeps it among the best crypto to buy for November for those seeking steady, utility-driven growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Interest Surges Before Q4 Breakout As traders rotate capital into new altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching attention. Over 21,000 new investors joined after the team confirmed listings on both a major DEX and CEX. Market watchers say whales are quietly building positions under $0.0006 , expecting what could become the biggest Q4 breakout among low-cost coins. Imagine holding before a surge to $0.1 — that’s a 1000x gain from today’s price. Many see it as a way to diversify from top caps while still capturing big upside. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE? Whale entries ahead of listings Early-stage altcoin under $0.0006 Transparent, community-driven model With buzz growing, MAGACOIN FINANCE joins Bitcoin, XRP, ADA, and LINK among the best crypto to buy for November . How Traders Can Position Now Traders are shifting from panic to preparation. The October crash created fresh entry zones for top coins. Those diversifying into upcoming names like MAGACOIN FINANCE could be early in the next breakout wave.

Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview Shiba Inu Investor Confidence Remains Strong as Wallet Count Grows The rise in holders, though modest, reflects continued confidence in Shiba Inu’s long-term prospects. On-chain analyst Etherscan_SHIB described the trend as “strong momentum,” noting that new investors continue entering the ecosystem even amid volatility. Currently, Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades near $0.00000985 with a market capitalization of about $5.86 billion, down over 47% year-over-year. Nonetheless, the community’s ability to expand during a bearish cycle underscores the meme coin’s enduring cultural and retail appeal. Exchange Inflows Raise Short-Term Concerns Despite strong community participation, short-term risks remain elevated. Data from CryptoQuant revealed that Shiba Inu exchange reserves rose by over 56.6 billion SHIB within 24 hours, suggesting increased selling intent. The movement of tokens from self-custody to exchanges typically signals short-term profit-taking or fear of further downside. Analysts also point to a descending triangle formation on SHIB’s chart, a bearish technical pattern that often precedes breakdowns. The base support around $0.00001052 has been tested multiple times since April, and a confirmed breach could push prices toward $0.000006. Nevertheless, Shiba Inu’s ability to avoid “adding another zero” to its price this week has been celebrated as a small but meaningful psychological victory for holders. Can Token Burns and Shibarium Drive the 2025 Rebound? Analysts remain divided on whether SHIB can mount a strong comeback in 2025. Optimists cite the growing Shibarium layer-2 adoption and an active token burn mechanism as potential catalysts for a long-term rebound. These mechanisms aim to reduce SHIB’s massive 589 trillion supply, which critics argue is the biggest barrier to significant price appreciation. Bullish forecasts suggest that if burns accelerate and network utility grows, SHIB could retest $0.000025–$0.00005 in a favorable 2025 market. However, others warn that sustained gains will depend on Shiba Inu delivering on its DeFi, metaverse, and NFT marketplace promises.

53523291,611625,1761188441,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53523291.jpeg,Ethereum Will Impose Gas Limit In Fusaka Upgrade,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-gas-limit-fusaka-upgrade/,"The Ethereum Foundation has confirmed that the upcoming Fusaka hard fork will introduce a protocol-level ceiling on how much gas a single transaction may consume, formally codified as EIP-7825. The cap is set at 2²⁴ gas—16,777,216 units—marking the first time Ethereum enforces a per-transaction limit distinct from the block gas limit. The change is already active on Holesky and Sepolia and will go live on mainnet when Fusaka activates . In a post published October 21, Toni Wahrstätter framed the rationale in direct terms: “Starting with the upcoming Fusaka hard fork, EIP-7825 introduces a per-transaction gas limit cap of 2²⁴ (≈ 16.78 million gas).” The Foundation’s note emphasizes that while the cap bounds individual transactions, it does not alter the block gas limit; instead, it is designed to mitigate denial-of-service vectors where a single oversized call monopolizes an entire block and to improve block packing predictability as the network prepares for parallel execution. EIP-7825 draws a clean line between transaction-level complexity and system-level throughput. Previously, exceptionally large calls could approach the full block gas target (around 45 million at times), creating timing and scheduling pathologies for builders and validators. The new ceiling obliges workloads that would exceed 16.78 million gas to be broken into smaller, sequenced calls. The Foundation’s guidance is careful to note that “for most users, nothing changes,” since the statistical distribution of real-world transactions already sits well below the threshold; the risk surface primarily concerns batch-heavy contracts, deployment scripts, and specialized routers. What This Means For Ethereum And Users From a roadmap perspective, the cap is explicitly positioned as groundwork for parallel execution. The blog post connects the change to anticipated efforts such as EIP-7928 in the “Glamsterdam” era, where predictable, bounded transactions are a prerequisite for meaningful concurrency in the execution layer. By ensuring that at least several independent transactions can be packed per block—even under pathological mempool conditions—the cap reduces worst-case contention and simplifies scheduler design for builders experimenting with parallelizable execution paths. The specification itself is spare and mechanical. EIP-7825’s abstract states the intent “to 16,777,216 (2^24) gas” per transaction, improving resilience against certain DoS vectors and making transaction processing more predictable as block limits rise. That simplicity has been part of its appeal in core-dev channels: a small, well-scoped constraint that preserves forward compatibility with more ambitious scaling work. Debate on how to encode and communicate the ceiling has been active for months, including discussions over naming and parameterization on Ethereum Magicians and during AllCoreDevs calls. One thread summarized the core guarantee being targeted by several contributors: aligning block targets to multiples of 2²⁴ so builders can always include at least n transactions if the mempool has n eligible ones—an argument for predictability rather than raw throughput. Operationally, the Foundation says all major clients —Geth, Erigon, Reth, Nethermind, and Besu—have implemented the change in Fusaka-ready releases, reducing cross-client divergence risk at activation. The post also stresses that eth_call semantics are unaffected and that pre-signed transactions whose gas limits exceed 2²⁴ will need to be re-signed below the cap. The upgrade path for developers is straightforward: test against Holesky or Sepolia, re-tool batch operations that flirt with the limit, and adjust gas-estimation logic and alerts so they fail fast when constructions exceed the new ceiling. The policy context is worth parsing. Ethereum’s history has favored minimal, general-purpose constraints, deferring complexity to higher layers. EIP-7825 fits that pattern: it does not opine on what contracts should do, only that they respect an upper bound that protects liveness and prepares the execution layer for a multi-threaded future. It also sidesteps fee-market alterations and leaves blob-space economics and block targets to other EIPs and forks. As the Foundation put it, the cap “establishes a safer and more predictable foundation for higher throughput in future forks ,” a line that sums up the trade-off succinctly. At press time, ETH traded at $3,835.",Ethereum|EIP-7825|ETH|ETH news|Ether|Ethereum Fusaka|ethereum news,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 03:00:41
53521721,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87292,1761188553,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: Ripple Could Acquire Chris Larsen’s 2.5 Billion XRP Holdings. Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-ripple-could-acquire-chris-larsens-2-5-billion-xrp-holdings-heres-why/,"A growing discussion within the XRP community has centered on the vast XRP holdings of Ripple’s co-founder and executive chairman, Chris Larsen. The speculation began after a market observer known as XRP Liquidity suggested that Ripple might eventually purchase Larsen’s remaining tokens, which amount to roughly 2.5 billion XRP. The analyst’s comments follow Evernorth’s recent initiative to create the world’s largest XRP treasury , a project that has drawn attention from several prominent institutional investors. Evernorth aims to raise $1 billion worth of XRP for this effort, marking the first large-scale treasury program of its kind. My guess is Ripple is or will be buying Larsens remaining 2.5B XRP. Expect alot more of Larsen off loading if true. Especially, if all 2.5B is off loaded. Same with Britto. At $200 XRP price Larsens 2.5B XRP would be worth 500B dollars. They will not let him have that. https://t.co/YdvbBz0q6B — XRP_Liquidity (Larsen/Britto/Escrow/ODL/RLUSD) (@XRPwallets) October 21, 2025 Evernorth’s XRP Treasury and Larsen’s Contribution Times Tabloid recently reported that the Japanese financial powerhouse SBI Holdings is among the firms backing Evernorth’s plan, having pledged $200 million. Ripple itself is expected to contribute around $300 million, while additional investors have committed a combined $645 million. As part of his personal involvement, Chris Larsen donated 50 million XRP, valued at approximately $120 million, to the initiative. The transaction, which took place on October 20 from one of his wallets identified as “chrislarsen2,” was initially mistaken by some market participants as a potential selloff. However, later clarifications confirmed that the transfer represented his contribution to Evernorth’s fundraising campaign rather than a liquidation event. Following this transaction, Larsen’s personal XRP balance stands at roughly 2.5 billion tokens. These holdings trace back to the early days of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), when he and other co-founders received large token allocations after the network’s creation more than a decade ago. Could Ripple Acquire Larsen’s Holdings? The suggestion that Ripple might purchase Larsen’s XRP stems from the company’s interest in maintaining market stability and preventing future large-scale liquidations. XRP Liquidity argued that while Larsen remains affiliated with Ripple, his personal control over billions of tokens presents a potential market imbalance that the company could eventually seek to address. Observers have compared the situation to that of Jed McCaleb, another Ripple co-founder who sold his entire XRP holdings on the open market after parting ways with the company. McCaleb’s sales, which took nearly eight years to complete, often exerted selling pressure on the asset’s price during that period. The same analyst also highlighted that Ripple might consider acquiring the XRP owned by Arthur Britto, another co-founder who remains largely out of the public eye. Data from XRPScan indicates that Britto holds about 1.3 billion XRP, currently valued at over $3 billion. In contrast, Larsen’s remaining holdings are worth around $6 billion at current prices. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Implications for Ripple and the Market Larsen’s XRP balance places him among the wealthiest individuals in the crypto space, with a net worth comparable to prominent billionaires such as Mark Cuban. The scale of his holdings has fueled speculation about what could happen if XRP’s price were to rise significantly. According to XRP Liquidity , a hypothetical scenario in which XRP reaches $200 per token would push Larsen’s wealth to an estimated $500 billion, a figure that could create serious concentration concerns within the ecosystem. The analyst suggested that Ripple may prefer to manage this by purchasing or redistributing some of those holdings, though there is no evidence that the company has such plans at this time. At present, the idea remains purely speculative. Neither Ripple nor Larsen has indicated any intention to initiate a buyback or transfer arrangement. Still, the discussion highlights the influence of large individual holders on XRP’s long-term market dynamics and the company’s ongoing efforts to balance decentralization with financial stability.

It has captured my attention with the recent announcement that they own 2.7% of ETH supply. BMNR is a speculative venture, with a steep premium between its ETH and market cap, but it also has the backing of some famous investors with deep pockets. ETH is itself a speculative vehicle, and so adding corporate leverage to it, like the 50M shares BMNR created to buy ETH with, ratchets up the risks to crypto. Corporate leverage also ratchets up the reward, as we've seen with MSTR and Bitcoin. BMNR aims to be the MSTR of Ethereum. Currently, BMNR is sitting on $1B in unrealized losses, although this may be temporary based on where Ethereum goes from here. Regular readers of mine will know that I have a fixation on cryptocurrency treasury companies, or firms that hold crypto like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), and Solana ( SOL-USD ) on their balance sheets instead of US Dollars. I've covered a few of these firms, as well as an ETF that holds the convertible bonds issued by these firms, and so little surprises me now when I see charts like today's focus, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (BMNR). The market just can't get enough of crypto treasury companies, it seems. Here's the YTD, including the massive spike in July when they made the shift from being solely a Bitcoin mining operation to an Ethereum treasury company. Data by YCharts Other shifts, such as adding famous investor Tom Lee (Fundstrat and the GRNY ETF) as chairman and the news of Peter Thiel ( PYPL and PLTR notoriety, among others) taking a 9% stake in the firm, have also supercharged its stock. Since that spike in July died down (condolences to those who bought at the top), the firm has still had significant volatility. Here's a zoomed-in look since August, essentially excluding the announcements that drove the stock. I'll map ETH against it, too, to show how the firm's price is now tied to its treasury holding. Data by YCharts Note that sometimes charts can be deceiving. Mapped like that, with two different Y-axes, the correlation is visible, but the difference in returns is obscured. Here's the normalized chart so you can see how volatile BMNR is compared to ETH. Data by YCharts The Anatomy of an ETH Treasury Company One thing to consider is that investors track how much Ethereum BMNR owns and how much it is worth. That dramatically influences their stock price, especially because most of the treasury holdings are bought with debt and stock issuance, providing inherent leverage. In BMNR's case, most of their financing has been done through share issuance, heavily diluting the pool. Six months ago (pre-treasury announcement), there were fewer than 2M shares, and now there are over 50M. Data by YCharts For the record, this kind of jump is not normal. In fact, most large corporations do the opposite and buy back shares from the market. The idea here is not to dilute shareholders out of their value, although that is what happens when new shares are issued en masse, but to generate enough cash to build an Ethereum position worth investing in after the dilution. This dynamic creates a situation where the company is valued partially on its ETH holdings and partially on its ability to continue amassing ETH. The wider this divergence, the more risk there is to investors. As of Oct. 21st (time of writing), the BMNR's treasury was worth $12.4B and its market cap was $16.5B. Here is the last month of fluctuations between the two figures: Moonfarm The timing of the buys from BMNR is important too because investors are relying on the corporate operations to provide value. This is one way they can easily and cheaply raise BMNR's value, getting good deals on ETH purchases. We can track these purchases, going back the last three months since the announcement, to see how BMNR is doing. It's also helpful to see when their USD holdings change. If they get too low, expect more share dilution or debt issuance. Moonfarm ETH's price has been falling in the last few days, and so BMNR is currently underwater on their ETH purchases. This may be temporary, and your view of that will depend on your opinions on ETH. If the price recovers, these unrealized losses will turn to unrealized gains and boost BMNR's stock price. Moonfarm Controlling Ethereum Because cryptocurrency networks are democratic machines with your votes tied to your assets, it is in the best interest of whales to stay that way and to accumulate more and more of the network so that they have an outsized effect. To this end, BMNR has been keeping tabs on how much of the ETH supply they own, which is now at 2.7% of currently issued tokens . Their goal is 5% of supply, which they call the ""Alchemy of 5%"" (0:3:18). With this power, treasury corps will increasingly have more and more say about what happens with the blockchain. BMNR believes that they are really a ""crypto infrastructure company,"" and their building out of validators for the ETH network is proof of this. It will also help them build a larger stake in ETH, as they will earn rewards for participating in the network. I can't say for certain if this strategy will bear fruit, mostly because it depends on the price of Ethereum, which is a very speculative endeavor. This is more and more true the shorter the timeframe you have, and so it stands to reason that investors should be very concerned with the risks of this plan panning out. Conclusion Ultimately, I am skeptical of folks calling BMNR the ""Strategy ( MSTR ) of Ethereum,"" but I get the comparison on some levels. Both firms have risen to the top of their respective cryptocurrencies in terms of how much they hold and have become whales in the space. This firm is very risky, and investors could easily lose their shirt on it if they buy in at the wrong time—valuation-wise, at least; see the 3000% spike and then 75% crash. I split the jump and crash into two charts to make this point: Data by YCharts Data by YCharts Investors going into this stock moving forward need to understand that this is an aggressive position, even more so than holding cryptocurrency outright. Volatility isn't always a bad thing, as shown in BMNR's outperformance of ETH itself, just like how MSTR has outperformed BTC. The corporate leverage adds risk, but also reward. That reward hinges on something that BMNR has little control of: the price of Ethereum. There are a lot of considerations, and the most important from my view is position size. Those wanting to hold this firm should deeply consider their sizing and its impact on their portfolio if ETH were to experience one of its infamous nose-dive crashes . Investors who believe ETH will outperform BTC moving forward will likely prefer BMNR to MSTR for the same reason.

Musk stayed silent on several pressing issues during the call. He did not address vehicle demand after an important federal tax credit ended last month. The Cybertruck went unmentioned. He said nothing about how tariffs on auto parts affect the business. Investors received no guidance on what to expect in the fourth quarter. The earnings themselves disappointed Wall Street, missing analyst predictions. But Musk chose to discuss his long-term plans rather than current sales figures and profit margins. “People just don’t don’t quite appreciate the degree to which this will take off, where it’s honestly, it’s going to be like a shock wave,” Musk said at the start of the call as mentioned in CNBC report. “We have millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars and, you know, we’re making a couple million a year.” div]:bg-bg-000/50 [&_pre>div]:border-0.5 [&_pre>div]:border-border-400 [&_.ignore-pre-bg>div]:bg-transparent [&_.standard-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pl-2 [&_.standard-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,ul,ol,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pr-8 [&_.progressive-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pl-2 [&_.progressive-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,ul,ol,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pr-8""> _*]:min-w-0 standard-markdown""> For many years, Elon Musk has pledged that Tesla car owners would be able to generate income by allowing their vehicles to operate as driverless taxis. Yet rival companies are making faster progress in this space. Waymo, owned by Alphabet, is broadening its paying robotaxi operations to additional cities, while Baidu’s Apollo Go service is expanding across China and beyond. Meanwhile, Tesla continues to be limited to limited-scale pilot initiatives. Robotaxi plans lag behind promises Back in July, Musk predicted Tesla would offer autonomous rides to “probably half the population of The U.S. by the end of the year.” The company still does not make or sell cars safe enough to operate without someone ready to take control. On Wednesday, Musk said Tesla plans to launch its driverless robotaxi service in Austin before the year ends. He added that the service would reach eight to 10 cities by the end of 2025, though those would have drivers on board. Finance chief Vaibhav Taneja revealed that “is still small” for FSD Supervised, Tesla’s driver-assistance system. Only 12% of users actually pay for it. Taneja did not share what customers pay on average after Tesla ran multiple promotions to boost sales. The company’s investor presentation showed FSD revenue fell below the $326 million reported a year earlier. That means FSD brought in less than 2% of total revenue this past quarter. After discussing robotaxis, Musk moved to humanoid robots. He repeated his claim that Optimus has the “potential to be the biggest product of all time.” Optimus is a two-legged robot Tesla is developing but has not released for commercial use. Musk previously said these robots could work in factories or watch children. He went further on Wednesday. “Optimus will be an incredible surgeon,” Musk said. He claimed that with Optimus and self-driving cars, “you can actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care.” Musk said Tesla would likely show off a new version called V3 in the first quarter of 2026. Pay package fight intensifies At the call’s conclusion, Musk connected robots to his compensation. Tesla introduced a new pay plan in September that could reach $1 trillion and give Musk 12% more ownership. Shareholders will vote on this plan at the annual meeting in early November. “If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?” Musk asked. “I don’t feel comfortable building that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.” He also attacked proxy advisors Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis after they told shareholders to reject his pay plan. Musk said the firms “have no freaking clue” and called them “corporate terrorists.” Neither firm responded immediately. The call did not cover anything Tesla might do soon to win back customers. Tesla’s brand ranking dropped to 25th place on the Interbrand 2025 Best Global Brands list from 12th in 2024.

As Solana reclaims center stage, a new wave of contenders is rising fast. Aster is gaining traction with its scalable DeFi ecosystem, while BullZilla ($BZIL) is turning heads as the market’s next potential 100x crypto. Together, Solana, Aster, and BullZilla are reshaping how investors view blockchain dominance in 2025, and the race is only just beginning. While Solana captures headlines with ETF momentum and Aster surges through multi-chain expansion, BullZilla is roaring ahead with one of the most explosive presales of the year. Its innovative tokenomics, 24-stage burn mechanism, and surging community growth are transforming early backers into long-term believers chasing massive gains. With unstoppable presale demand and a dynamic price structure, BullZilla is fast emerging as one of the top cryptos to join this week poised to outshine even Solana’s rally. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Explosive Presale Leading Top Cryptos to Join This Week BullZilla ($BZIL) is rewriting presale history as one of the top cryptos to join this week . Currently in Stage 7 (Bag Signal Activated, Phase C), the project has raised over $950,000, sold 31 billion tokens, and gained 3,100+ holders. The presale price stands at $0.00017907, with a +3.72% increase projected within seven days. BullZilla’s Progressive Price Engine automatically raises prices every 48 hours or after $100,000 is raised, creating constant scarcity and incentivizing early entry. Its 24-stage burn architecture and 70% APY HODL Furnace reward loyal investors who stake tokens long-term. Built on Ethereum, its security and transparency align with EEAT standards, making it a top presale. ROI Projection: $2,000 in BullZilla Today Could Explode to $54,800 A $2,000 investment at $0.00017907 secures 11.17 million $BZIL tokens. Once BullZilla lists at $0.00527, this investment would be worth $54,800, delivering an ROI of 2,843.77%. Early joiners from Stage 7C enjoy an even higher ROI of 3,014.26%, underscoring the benefits of timing. BullZilla’s scarcity mechanics, combining automatic burns, vault rewards, and staged price progression, make it a living ecosystem where each milestone strengthens token value. This presale isn’t just hype; it’s a structured pathway toward real deflationary growth. Your Last Shot: $0.00017907 BullZilla Tokens Before the Next Big Jump How to Join the BullZilla Presale Getting started with BullZilla is seamless. First, set up a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Purchase ETH through a reliable exchange like Binance or Coinbase, then transfer it to your wallet. Visit the official BullZilla presale site, connect your wallet, and swap ETH for $BZIL tokens. Your purchase will lock automatically, and tokens can be claimed after the presale concludes. Vesting and claim timelines are visible directly on the presale dashboard for complete transparency. Solana: ETF Approval and Ecosystem Expansion Fuel Momentum Solana remains a titan in smart contract innovation, proving its resilience even amid a volatile market. As Bitcoin stumbled below $108,000 with ETF outflows crossing $1.2 billion, Solana quietly achieved a milestone: Hong Kong launched the world’s first Solana ETF under ChinaAMC (HK). This event positioned Solana as the second major blockchain to achieve spot ETF status, boosting credibility among institutions. Despite a temporary 7% dip to $184, Solana’s fundamentals remain solid. Its ecosystem thrives with Uniswap adding SOL trading pairs, Gemini launching a Solana Card offering 6.77% auto-staking rewards, and Jito Foundation securing $50 million from a16z. Even with a 19% drop in DEX volume, Solana’s $11.06 billion TVL and leadership in daily DApp revenue confirm its dominance as one of the most efficient Layer-1 chains in the market. Aster: Multi-Chain Innovation Gains Institutional Confidence Aster ($ASTER) has become the quiet disruptor in 2025’s blockchain conversation. The token rose 4.98% to $1.21 with trading volume surpassing $643 million in just 24 hours. Its cross-chain interoperability model, linking Ethereum, Polkadot, and other major ecosystems, has drawn heavy developer migration from legacy networks. Institutional players are also paying attention. The Aster Foundation’s sustainability initiatives and enterprise-grade partnerships are positioning it as a stable long-term play. The network’s expansion across DeFi and gaming continues to generate consistent revenue, creating a steady demand curve. Analysts forecast that Aster could outperform several mid-cap rivals as it scales its validator network. For investors looking beyond volatility, Aster provides the perfect balance between innovation and institutional trust, making it one of the best cryptos to buy this week for sustained growth. Conclusion: Solana and Aster Show Strength, but BullZilla Defines Opportunity Solana and Aster exemplify how blockchain maturity drives steady growth, yet BullZilla proves that innovation plus timing creates exponential potential. Only BullZilla’s presale among the top cryptos to join this week offers investors a quantifiable path to multi-fold returns within a structured ecosystem. As presale stages shift every 48 hours or once $100,000 is raised, early participation remains the key to unlocking maximum upside. With community expansion, Ethereum-backed stability, and a transparent roadmap, BullZilla is shaping up to lead the next bull cycle, not just as a meme coin, but as a statement of financial evolution.

The Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio is an on-chain indicator that measures the ratio between BTC’s market cap and transaction volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Newbie Whales Now Sitting On $6.9 Billion In Losses, Most Since 2023 When the value of this metric is high, it means the value of the network (as represented by the market cap) is high compared to its ability to transact coins (the volume). Such a trend can be a sign that the asset may be overvalued. On the other hand, the indicator having a low value can imply the cryptocurrency’s price could have room to grow as its market cap isn’t inflated against its transaction volume. In the context of the current discussion, a modified form of the NVT Ratio called the NVT Golden Cross is the indicator of interest. This metric is a Bollinger-band-like signaling indicator that compares the short-term trend of the NVT Ratio (10-day moving average) against its long-term trend (30-day MA) to determine whether the indicator is near a top or bottom. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the Bitcoin NVT Ratio over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day EMA Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross currently has a value of around zero, which suggests the market is in a neutral phase according to the NVT Ratio. In the chart, the quant has highlighted the zones where tops and bottoms have historically tended to occur. It would appear that a highly positive value generally signals some sort of top for BTC, while a negative one can lead to a bottom. Related Reading: Chainlink To $100? Analyst Says This Breakout Could Be The Trigger In the current cycle so far, the indicator hasn’t seen any spike into the red zone. Whether this means that this bull market is an exception, or that Bitcoin is yet to reach its top, only remains to be seen. While Bitcoin market conditions are neutral from the perspective of the NVT Golden Cross, CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index is painting a different picture. As the analytics firm’s community analyst has noted in an X post, this indicator, which combines the data of several key on-chain metrics, is flashing a bear signal for the asset. BTC Price Bitcoin surged toward $114,000 on Tuesday, but it would appear that the recovery was only short-lived as the coin is already back at $108,000.

They filed a formal notice of appeal on Monday and are expected to file the full appeal papers soon. Diddy: Legal Outcome And Sentence According to court filings and public records, a jury convicted Combs on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution , while clearing him on two other charges, sex trafficking and racketeering. Judge Arun Subramanian imposed a 50-month prison term, a $500,000 fine, and five years of probation. At sentencing, the judge said a substantial term was needed so that abuse of women “is met with real accountability.” Combs had asked for a 14-month sentence so time already spent in custody would lead to a quick release. Prosecutors had pushed for more than 11 years. At the hearing, Combs told the judge, “My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick.” He said he got “lost in excess” and asked for mercy while apologizing to two women who testified against him. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs has filed a notice of appeal in his federal criminal case following his conviction and sentencing in New York. The legal move indicates he is challenging the court… https://t.co/kztoafXP5A #Diddy #LegalNews #FederalCourt — TC (@tc0888) October 21, 2025 Jury Findings And Trial Details Reports have disclosed that Combs was arrested in September 2024. His trial ran for nearly two-months this summer and drew widespread coverage. Witnesses described encounters that prosecutors said showed Combs used his influence in the music industry to pressure people into sexual situations. One witness, Cassandra Ventura, said she was physically abused and coerced into encounters described in court as “hotel nights.” Another witness who testified under the name Jane said she felt pressured even when she was unwell. The jury’s split verdict — guilty on the transportation counts but not guilty on sex trafficking and racketeering — leaves open legal and factual fights that the defense is likely to press on appeal. Jail Proximity And Public Interest Another angle that attracted attention was Combs’s placement at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he was housed in the same unit as Sam Bankman-Fried, the former crypto executive convicted in the FTX case. Sources say the two men shared dormitory-style housing and had some informal interactions. There is no public evidence linking Combs to the financial crimes at the center of Bankman-Fried’s conviction, and officials have not tied the two cases together. Tech And Crypto Connections Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs has taken part in several tech and crypto-adjacent moves in recent years. He was listed among investors in the banking app ECO, which raised roughly $26 million. He joined a funding round for a hologram and virtual-communications company that was about $12 million. Disclosure documents from June 2023 tied funds linked to Combs to a stake in X Corp. A celebrity-linked “DIDDY” meme token briefly reached a market cap near $180 million during news cycles, though links between Combs and that token remain unclear.

BTC could rise further if there is a clear move above the $109,500 barrier. Bitcoin started a fresh recovery wave above the $108,000 resistance level. The price is trading below $109,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $108,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it trades above the $109,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Takes Hit Bitcoin price declined again below the $109,500 level. BTC tested the $106,750 zone and is currently consolidating losses . A low was formed at $106,717 before the price recovered some losses. There was a move above the $107,500 and $108,000 levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $114,000 swing high to the $106,717 low. However, the bulls are now facing many hurdles. Bitcoin is now trading below $109,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $108,800 level. There is also a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $108,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The first key resistance is near the $109,500 level. The next resistance could be $110,500 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $114,000 swing high to the $106,717 low. A close above the $110,500 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $111,500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $112,000 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $113,500. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $109,500 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support is near the $107,200 level. The first major support is near the $106,750 level. The next support is now near the $105,800 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $105,000 support in the near term.

Many investors believe the SEC will resume its ETF reviews once the government shutdown is over. This renewed focus on regulation is boosting confidence and prompting traders to start positioning themselves for the next potential rally. Ethereum and Solana have been classified as the best crypto to buy before the next bull cycle . Both projects are experiencing high momentum with technological upgrades and increased institutional interest. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been identified among the standout projects gaining momentum and with growth potential due to its consistent growth and distinct model. XRP ETF Momentum Sparks Market Rotation The renewed market energy is because of the ongoing XRP ETF discussions. Several ETF decisions were suspended by the SEC when the government shut down. Analysts are anticipating prompt actions when the operations resume. The XRP ETF approvals may hasten the next stage in regulated crypto investment. Polymarket data shows a 99% probability that XRP ETF would be approved ahead of the next market cycle. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas referred to the delay as a minor pause, while Nate Geraci pointed to the growing institutional demand for crypto exposure. On October 22, Ripple, Coinbase, and several U.S. Senators participated in a key policy roundtable that could play a pivotal role in shaping ETF regulations for digital assets. The growing excitement over the ETF has sparked renewed interest in major altcoins. As market liquidity picks up, investors looking for huge gains are shifting their attention towards Ethereum and Solana. Ethereum Strengthens Ahead of Next Bull Cycle Ethereum is in its final testing phase of the Fusaka upgrade, which aims to achieve faster transactions and lower fees. This update is based on the Pectra fork and it focuses on scalability, security, and improved gas efficiency. Fusaka has been activated to the Sepolia and Holesky networks, and the last Hoodi testnet is planned for October 28. This upgrade has a gas limit of 16.78 million units per transaction to enhance reliability. The mainnet launch is scheduled for December 3 and may reinforce the role of Ethereum in decentralized finance. The lower fees will increase DeFi activity and restore confidence in long-term investors. Analysts describe Ethereum as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy before the next bull cycle because of its clear roadmap and expanding ecosystem. Solana ETF Approval Boosts Global Confidence The approval of the first spot Solana ETF in Hong Kong has generated a new buzz among international investors. On October 27, the ChinaAMC Solana ETF will list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and offer trading in HKD, CNY, and USD. The ETF has an annual management fee of 0.99% and offers secure exposure to Solana’s performance. The ChinaAMC ETF focuses on eliminating the need to operate with the tokens directly. The framework makes OSL Digital Securities the sub-custodian. This scheme meets the high requirements of Hongkong digital-asset and enables institutions to adopt it. This development strengthens the growth trend of Solana. Its growing ecosystem and speed make it one of the best crypto to buy before the next bull cycle MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as a Top Growth Pick The approval of the first spot Solana ETF in Hong Kong has generated a new buzz among international investors.

53524736,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=842889,1761194765,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53524736.jpeg,"South Korea maintains its interest rate at 2.5%, a decision some economists expected",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/south-korea-holds-the-interest-rate-at-2-5/,"Policymakers at South Korea’s central bank decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 2.5% on Thursday. The rate decision comes on the heels of new property restrictions in Seoul aimed at limiting debt growth. According to South Korean press reports on Oct. 15, the government expanded tougher property rules, including loan restrictions, to all 25 Seoul districts and 12 additional parts of Gyeonggi Province. Household debt remains a pressing issue for the Bank of Korea, which has avoided cutting interest rates to prevent a rebound in housing demand. Bank of America recognised that housing inflation is still a major focus in South Korea Economists polled by Reuters had widely expected the decision. The central bank has maintained a 3.5% rate for 1 year and 7 months before making four quarter-point cuts, two late last year and two earlier this year. It has now held rates steady for the third consecutive meeting , following similar moves in July and August. So far, analysts view the decision as aimed at cooling housing market sentiment, with Seoul’s property prices still firm even after the government’s June 27 measures restricting home loans to 600 million won, roughly $418,070. Speaking before the National Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee on the 20th, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong stated, “From the Bank of Korea’s perspective, we aim not to play a role in fueling the real estate market by further increasing liquidity.” Around the same time, Bank of America analysts noted that Seoul’s housing inflation has remained a key focus for policymakers, acting as a major obstacle to additional rate cuts in the second half of 2025. The analysts asserted that housing prices in central Seoul rose around mid-September, despite earlier government efforts to rein in the market. Although they argued that the current measures are likely to reduce housing transactions gradually, it is unclear to what extent they can stabilize prices. South Korea is still finalizing the trade deal details with Washington. South Korea’s rate announcement also comes at a time of uncertainty in its trade relations with the U.S., as both governments struggle to conclude talks on a July 30 agreement. As part of the accord, South Korea is expected to invest $350 billion in the U.S.. However, President Lee Jae Myung warned in an interview that transferring it all at once could destabilize the economy. According to reports, negotiators plan to visit Washington this week to finalize details before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in South Korea on October 31. Kim Yong-beom, Seoul’s chief policy advisor, says talks have “moved beyond most issues,” though a few sticking points still need attention. Kim revealed this after returning from Washington, where he held meetings with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and senior economic officials. According to Kim, both sides now anticipate “real progress” before their presidents meet on the sidelines of the summit. The optimism came after months of gridlock. President Donald Trump had earlier said that Washington agreed to cut import tariffs on South Korean goods to 15%, provided that Seoul commits to $350 billion in U.S. investments. The announcement, made on July 30, marked a significant thaw in relations between the two economies. Still, auto tariffs remain in place as the two sides continue to haggle over how the investment will be structured and implemented. A South Korean delegation, headed by Kim Yong-beom, as well as the industry minister, Kim Jung-kwan, the finance minister, Koo Yun-cheol, and the trade minister, Yeo Han-koo, arrived in Washington last week to finalize details of the $350 billion pledge. As previously reported by Cryptopollitan, most of this will be in loans and guarantees rather than direct capital outflows, aiming to minimize the impact on foreign exchange markets, according to Seoul. Trump, meanwhile, had said that the payment would be made “upfront.” During its most recent meeting in August, the Bank of Korea revised its 2025 inflation estimate upward to 2% from 1.9%, and its growth projection to 0.9% from 0.8%. The BOK also anticipates a modest upturn in domestic demand, driven by additional fiscal spending and improving household sentiment. However, the bank warned that exports will probably maintain favorable trends for a while before slowing due to the expanding impact of U.S. tariffs. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Related Reading: The XRP Shockwave Will Hit When No One’s Watching—Analyst The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have agreed to legalize crypto settlements for international trade, allowing Russian exporters and importers to transact in Bitcoin and other digital assets. This follows an experimental legal regime introduced in September, which tested crypto use for cross-border settlements. BTC's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Russia Moves to Legalize Crypto for International Trade Under the new Russian policy, all crypto transactions for foreign trade will be processed through regulated channels supervised by the Central Bank, ensuring strict AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know-Your-Customer) compliance. The framework maintains Russia’s domestic crypto payment ban to protect the ruble but opens the door for Bitcoin- and stablecoin-based trade with partners in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. Officials describe the reform as a “strategic necessity” that shields the economy from global financial isolation while promoting alternative trade routes. Bitcoin Authorized for Trade as Dedollarization Accelerates In a landmark development, Russia’s Ministry of Finance has authorized Bitcoin for foreign trade, marking one of the biggest policy reversals since the 2021 crypto ban. The move aligns with the Kremlin’s dedollarization agenda and leverages Russia’s massive energy reserves to support Bitcoin mining and liquidity. With over 2,395 BTC recently transferred by SpaceX’s corporate wallets sparking renewed market debate about corporate adoption, Moscow’s decision shows how state actors are now embracing the same asset once dismissed as “too volatile.” Analysts say Russia’s new framework may push BRICS nations like China and India to expand their own blockchain-based settlement systems, especially as global trade shifts away from dollar dependence. Bitcoin (BTC) rose past $108,500 following the announcement, with traders viewing Russia’s entry into crypto-backed commerce as validation of Bitcoin’s role as a neutral global reserve asset. Legal Integration and Global Implications Beyond trade, Russian lawmakers are also fast-tracking a Family Code amendment to classify cryptocurrency as marital property, a step toward full legal recognition of digital assets. The draft bill, sponsored by State Duma member Igor Antropenko, seeks to close loopholes that allow hidden crypto wealth during divorce proceedings, signaling how deeply digital assets are being woven into Russian law. If fully implemented, Russia’s crypto framework could reshape the geopolitical balance of finance. It offers a blueprint for sanctioned or developing economies to bypass Western-controlled systems like SWIFT.

ChinaAMC To List First Solana Spot ETF In Hong Kong As reported by the Hong Kong Economic Times, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has approved the first Solana spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Hong Kong. A spot ETF is an investment vehicle that allows investors to gain exposure to an underlying asset without having to directly own it. In the case of a cryptocurrency like SOL, this means that traders can invest without having to hold actual tokens on the blockchain. Hong Kong approved spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum in April 2024. The BTC products followed three months after they were approved in the US by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but the Chinese city led the way with ETH products. The same dynamic appears to be playing out again. With the US government currently facing a shutdown that has frozen SEC operations, Hong Kong’s SFC has beaten the American regulator to approving a Solana spot ETF. The spot ETF, issued by Chinese asset management company ChinaAMC, is set to launch on October 27th. It will be available in three trading lots: HKD, RMB, and USD. Each is equivalent to 100 tokens of the cryptocurrency. ChinaAMC previously launched Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs on the Hong Kong stock exchange as part of the initial wave of approvals granted by the SFC in April 2024. Over in the US, several SOL ETF filings are waiting to be processed , but with the current government shutdown, it’s unclear when they will finally be reviewed. Other altcoins like Dogecoin and XRP have also seen their filings similarly delayed. Speaking of the US spot ETFs, Bitcoin funds witnessed a notable amount of inflows on Tuesday, as data from SoSoValue shows. In total, the Bitcoin spot ETFs captured net inflows of about $477 million, breaking the trend of outflows from the last week. Ethereum funds also saw the incoming of capital, but their inflows of $141 million weren’t as significant as those of BTC products. As mentioned before, spot ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to a cryptocurrency’s price movements without directly having to own tokens on the blockchain. For traditional traders unfamiliar with digital asset exchanges and wallets, this quality can make these vehicles a convenient entry point into the asset. Bitcoin and Ethereum funds were able to tap into a new market in this way, and the same could potentially happen with Solana. That said, it only remains to be seen how demand for SOL spot ETFs will end up looking. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is trading around $186, down 8% over the last week.",Solana|hong kong|SOL|solana|Solana Hong Kong ETF|Solana Spot ETF|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|ETH|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 05:00:44

Rowe Price Files for First Active XRP ETF Holding,https://timestabloid.com/1-68-trillion-t-rowe-price-files-for-first-active-xrp-etf-holding/,"A recent update shared by crypto commentator JackTheRippler has shifted attention to a new filing from investment giant T. Rowe Price with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the document shown, the firm submitted a Form S-1 registration statement on October 22, 2025, for a proposed “T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF.” The filing indicates the ETF would be sponsored by T. Rowe Price Sponsor LLC and appear under the Securities Act of 1933. The development is being discussed within the crypto sector as a notable instance of a major traditional finance player taking a formal regulatory step toward digital asset exposure, reportedly including XRP among its holdings. Community Reaction and Market Interpretation In the hours following the report, several users on X commented on the significance of the filing. One observer highlighted that traditional finance institutions increasingly appear to be entering the digital asset space, calling it a quiet but steady shift of capital and attention. Another described the move as a pivotal moment for institutional engagement with XRP, suggesting it could represent the beginning of more direct participation from large-scale asset managers. The general tone across these reactions centered on the expectation that a regulated, actively managed ETF backed by a firm of T. Rowe Price’s stature could signal expanding recognition of digital assets within established investment frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Understanding the Filing’s Implications The filing of a Form S-1 marks the preliminary stage of the registration process for an exchange-traded fund. It signals intent, but has not yet been approved to operate or list the product on an exchange. Details such as the ETF’s exact composition, weighing of assets, and management strategy are expected to become clearer in subsequent filings or amendments. The appearance of XRP in connection with the proposed ETF remains based on community interpretation of the report shared by JackTheRippler and other commentators, as the SEC has not yet published the full filing contents for public inspection. Institutional Implication If the filing proceeds as described, T. Rowe Price would become one of the most prominent global asset managers to register an active cryptocurrency ETF with exposure to XRP . The firm’s $1.68 trillion in assets under management underscores the scale of potential market impact should the fund advance through regulatory review and receive listing approval. Whether this marks a single initiative or part of a wider institutional trend will depend on additional disclosures and the SEC’s response to the registration.

Momentum remains weak, with the RSI at 27 indicating oversold conditions, but no reversal has occurred yet. The MACD stays negative, confirming bearish bias.

The Alligator lines remain in a downtrend, showing no confirmed reversal, but repeated tests near $0.0198 hint at base-building.

The price is struggling to clear $2.50 and might decline if it trades below the $2.320 support. XRP price is moving lower from the $2.550 zone. The price is now trading below $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $2.320 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.450 resistance. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price formed a base above $2.250 and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price surpassed the $2.40 and $2.420 resistance levels. The bulls were able to push the price above $2.50. However, the bears remained active near the $2.550 level. A high was formed at $2.5520 and the price recently corrected some gains. It dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.190 swing low to the $2.5520 high. Besides, there was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $2.320 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.420 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.50 level, above which the price could rise and test $2.550. A clear move above the $2.550 resistance might send the price toward the $2.580 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.720. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.420 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.320 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.190 swing low to the $2.5520 high. The next major support is near the $2.2750 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.2750 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.220. The next major support sits near the $2.20 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

There has been no September jobs report, any key inflation data, or initial jobless claims for weeks. Additionally, the Fed has lost access to key private jobs data from ADP, covering 20% of private workers, reported the WSJ and Kobeissi Letter. “The Fed must lean even more dovish as the government shutdown continues, and they must cut rates,” it said before adding: “In fact, odds of a 50 basis point rate cut by year-end are surging.” Impact On Crypto The Fed will continue to cut rates aggressively in the wake of the data blackout and stagflation for one simple reason: “they are afraid of being ‘too late’.” CME futures markets currently predict a 96.7% probability of a 25 basis point rate cut at the FOMC meeting on October 29. The likelihood of a further 0.25% cut in December has also surged to 96.5% and the odds of a third cut in January are almost 60%. When the Fed cuts rates , traditional safe investments like savings accounts, Treasury bonds, and money market funds offer lower returns. This makes riskier assets like crypto more attractive by comparison, as Investors seeking higher yields are more likely to allocate capital to crypto when they’re earning minimal interest elsewhere. Rate cuts also make borrowing cheaper, which puts more money into circulation throughout the financial system, increasing liquidity. “Many traders look back at positive Q4 performance, anticipating repetition, so they buy, and the price goes up,” said analyst ‘cryptobirb’ before adding: “All in all, the recent [leverage flush] crisis shouldn’t cancel year-end run.” “The government shutdown has halted the drain of the TGA (Treasury General Account) and No RRP (Reverse Repo Facility) to drain [which means] less liquidity (temporarily) [leading to] sloppy crypto as the pointy end of the liquidity spear,” said economist Raoul Pal, who added, “This too shall pass.” The government shutdown has halted the drain of the TGA + No RRP to drain > Less liquidity (temporarily) > sloppy crypto as the pointy end of the liquidity spear. This too shall pass.. If you don’t understand best ask @grok or the Raoulbot on @RealVision for my views https://t.co/AXsQMVgz7l — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) October 23, 2025 The Senate failed to advance the House-passed funding bill that would end the government shutdown for the 12th time on Wednesday, which means the stalemate will continue. Markets Begin to Consolidate Crypto markets have not moved much over the past 24 hours, with total capitalization at $3.75 trillion. Bitcoin has traded in a tight range around the key $108,000 support-turned-resistance level and has struggled to break above it.

BTC dropped to $108,600, down by 14% from its highest point this year. This article explores some of the top reasons why the BTC price may drop further in the near term. Bitcoin price is about to form a death cross The daily timeframe chart shows that the coin has been in a strong bearish downtrend in the past few months. It has plunged from the year-to-date high of $126,300 to the current $108,600. A closer look shows that it is about to form a death cross pattern as the spread between the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages (EMA) has continued to narrow in the past few days. This is a sign that the coin is about to form a death cross, which often leads to more downside. Bitcoin price has also formed a double-top pattern at $124,375 and a neckline at $108,357, its lowest level in June. This double-top pattern’s depth is about 12.2%. Measuring the same distance from the neckline goves it a target of $95,000, which coincides with the extreme oversold level of the Murrey Math Lines tool. Bitcoin price is also in the process of forming a bearish pennant pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle pattern. Bitcoin price chart | Source: TradingView BTC price has formed a rising wedge and divergence The other main reason why the Bitcoin price may crash further is that numerous bearish patterns have formed on the weekly chart. Bitcoin has formed a rising wedge pattern, which happens when there are two rising and converging trendlines. The two lines are about to converge, which may lead to a strong bearish breakout. At the same time, top oscillators show that the coin has more downside as it has formed a bearish divergence pattern. The True Strength Index (TSI) has continued moving downwards as Bitcoin has jumped. Other oscillators have also continued forming a bearish divergence pattern. This includes popular indicators like the Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). These patterns point to more downside in the near term. The price target is established by first measuring the distance of the widest part and then the same one from the breakout point. This distance is about 48%, meaning that the coin may crash below $60,000 in the coming months. BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Crypto Fear and Greed Index is falling The other key catalyst for the Bitcoin price crash is that there is a sense of fear happening in the crypto industry. Data shows that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has tumbled to the fear zone of 28. It has been in a major downtrend after peaking at the greed zone of 63 in May this year. Crypto Fear and Greed Index chart | Source: CMC The CNN Money Fear and Greed Index has moved to the fear zone of 26. Further downside will have it move to the extreme fear zone of 25. Most of the gauges, including the stock price breadth, put and call options, safe haven demand, and junk bond demand have all moved to the extreme fear zone. This fear explains why investors have been reluctant to invest in Bitcoin ETFs. These funds had a net outflow of $1.28 billion last week. While they have gained $335 million so far this week, they have remained lower than their historical standards. Bitcoin price may also continue falling as US inflation remains at an elevated level. Higher inflation may prevent the Fed from cutting rates aggressively.

The move marks T. Rowe Price’s first foray into the crypto fund space and a notable shift for a company that manages $1.8 trillion in assets. T. Rowe Price Crypto ETF Comes as a Surprise Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, described the move as a “semi-shock,” underscoring its unexpected yet impactful entry. “Did not expect it but I get it.

Besides, this is a rare kind of proposal for new multi-coin products, he added. “It’s a surprise to see them as a relatively late entrant, but they’re planning to offer something differentiated to try and break into the space,” he told Reuters. Crypto Fund to Hold 15 Digital Assets: S-1 Prospectus Reveals Per the SEC filing, the multi-crypto ETF would track prices of 15 digital assets, including Bitcoin , Ethereum , XRP , Solana , Cardano , Litecoin and more. The fund may invest in other eligible assets not mentioned, the S1 prospectus read. “Under normal circumstances, the Fund is expected to hold between five and fifteen crypto assets; however, the Fund may hold more or less at any time.” T. Rowe Price joins a growing list of asset managers looking to list ETFs based on crypto and altcoins. Per Eric Balchunas, there are 155 crypto ETF filings tracking 35 different digital assets so far. “Could easily end up seeing over 200 hit mkt in next 12 months,” he wrote.

Despite the subdued macro backdrop, HTX achieved solid growth across trading volume, user acquisition, listing innovation, brand activity, and security, marking another standout quarter for the exchange. Steadily Growing Trading Volume, Assets, and Organic Traffic In the third quarter of 2025, HTX’s total trading volume rose by 25% quarter-over-quarter, while new registrations grew by 13%, expanding the platform’s user base to new highs. Total user assets on HTX reached $6.87 billion, up 6.4% from the previous quarter, solidifying the platform’s position as the world’s leading exchange. Traffic metrics also reflected the platform’s rising influence, with total impressions up 7% to 13 million, page views up 37% to 46 million, and unique visitors up 43% to 19 million. The continued growth in organic traffic underscores HTX’s expanding global reach and user engagement. High-Quality New Assets Become Wealth Boosters and Quarterly $HTX Burn Hits New High Q3 also marked a breakthrough for new listings. HTX introduced 39 quality projects, including initial listings such as TREE , CAMP , WLFI , HOLO , LINEA , AVNT , ASTER , 0G , XPL , and FF . Many of these generated outsized returns for early participants. AVNT, ASTER, 0G, and XPL all presented a near doubling of investments. ASTER , featuring an innovative “no-MEV, low-slippage” model, surged by 400% after listing, becoming the quarter’s top performer. AVNT , a standout Base ecosystem token, delivered a threefold increase, while WLFI , a DeFi project backed by the Trump family, captured broad market attention. HTX’s steady stream of promising assets further reinforced its reputation as a launchpad for new opportunities and a premier destination for early-stage token listings. On the tokenomics front, HTX DAO officially announced the completion of its Q3 $HTX burn on October 14, a total of 13,119,801,941,748 $HTX, worth over $27.03 million. This burn, up 11.19% quarter-over-quarter, sets a new record since the launch of the burn mechanism. Cumulatively, HTX DAO has now burnt approximately 85.88 trillion $HTX tokens, valued at $163 million. These ongoing deflationary measures continue to optimize token circulation and strengthen $HTX’s long-term value foundation. Meanwhile, HTX DAO is expanding its global developer ecosystem, focusing on CeFi–DeFi integration, RWA innovation, and other on-chain $HTX applications, empowering builders with resources, exposure, and sustainable growth opportunities. Marketing Campaigns and Branding for Greater Global Influence HTX maintained strong marketing momentum throughout Q3 with a series of high-engagement events, covering stablecoin trading, Ethereum’s 10th anniversary, the TRON brand, and trending assets like SOL, TRUMP, USD1, and WLFI. These events attracted over 100,000 registered participants and airdropped tens of billions of $HTX, enhancing platform activity and amplifying its global brand visibility. In terms of brand exposure, HTX continued to expand both online and offline reach. At GM Vietnam, more than 1,300 users registered onsite, setting a strong tone for the quarter. During TOKEN2049 Singapore and the afterparty, HTX DAO and HTX Ventures achieved a combined brand reach of 254 million impressions, over 3,100 clients, and 800 industry professionals with the 12th-anniversary “Flame” element leaving a lasting impression. Meanwhile, Justin Sun attended the afterparty and awarded the top 3 performers at the Miss HTX Finals. Product Upgrades and Forward-Looking Research From a product standpoint, HTX introduced key product upgrades to enhance security and experience. Accounts now support YubiKeys, providing enhanced account protection. Spot trading received a comprehensive overhaul, while Collateral Swap 2.0 went live, offering multi-asset collateral and interest-free borrowing to support users’ diversified asset management needs. HTX Ventures and HTX Research continued to publish influential insights throughout the quarter. HTX Ventures released a string of reports, including “Are Tokenized Stocks A Treat or A Trap?” , analyzing the emerging stock tokenization, regulatory trends, and institutional coordination for in-depth reading of the RWA sector. HTX Research published its flagship reports “The New Stablecoin Order: Restructuring Global Payments, Regulatory Legitimization, and the Capital War (Part I)” and “The New Order of Stablecoins (Part II): Exploring Stablecoin Public Blockchains — From Settlement Layer Reconstruction to Next-Generation Design Paradigms” , dissecting stablecoin payment reconstruction, regulatory progress, and blockchain-native settlement models. The reports have since become widely cited across the industry. Additionally, the midyear report “H1 2025 Key Industry Highlights: DAT Becomes the Standard, Perpetual DEX Aggregators Surge, Stablecoin Channels Dominate, and More” provided a comprehensive review of sectoral trends, highlighting TRON and HTX as key drivers in the evolving stablecoin and new asset markets. Further Strengthening Security and Premium Service with the Anti-Scam Official Channel Security remains at the heart of HTX’s operations, proven by great risk management efforts and multi-layer security building.

He expects Bitcoin to stay between $100,000 and $125,000 unless new catalysts emerge. Meanwhile, optimism is rising elsewhere as Japan’s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, introduced a major stimulus package that could boost Bitcoin demand through increased liquidity. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes called the move a sign of more money printing and predicted it could eventually drive Bitcoin to $1 million. 250K Bitcoin Is Unrealistic Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz poured some cold water on the popular prediction that Bitcoin will hit $250,000 by the end of the year. He did this by saying that such a move would require extraordinary circumstances. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Novogratz said that with just over two months left in 2025, it would take “a heck of a lot of crazy stuff” for Bitcoin to gain the kind of momentum needed to more than double its current price. At press time, Bitcoin was trading around $108,56. This means it would need to surge roughly 130+% in just ten weeks to reach the ambitious target. Mike Novogratz’s CNBC interview Novogratz believes that a more realistic outcome is for Bitcoin to trade within a range rather than experience another parabolic rally before the year’s end. He said that, in a worst-case scenario, Bitcoin should hold around $100,000, which is a key psychological level it first broke in December 2024 after Donald Trump’s reelection as US president. That price point was nearly tested earlier this month after Trump announced sweeping 100% tariffs on China, which sent Bitcoin tumbling to about $102,000. On the upside, Novogratz said Bitcoin would need to break past $125,000, its previous all-time high, to regain bullish momentum. He also said that the market is likely to stay “rangy between $100,000 and $120,000 or $125,000” unless new catalysts emerge. BTC’s price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) According to Novogratz, potential triggers that could propel Bitcoin higher include Trump attempting to influence the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions or the passage of the long-awaited CLARITY Act, or a crypto market structure bill that could provide regulatory clarity for digital assets. The crypto community is also closely watching the Federal Reserve, with a 96.7% probability of another rate cut at the upcoming Oct. 29 meeting, according to CME’s Fed Watch Tool. Bitcoin analyst PlanC argues that focusing too much on short-term price targets misses the point. “Anyone who thinks Bitcoin has to peak in Q4 of this year does not understand statistics or probability,” he said, and suggested that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory matters far more than where it ends the year. Japan’s Stimulus Sparks Bitcoin Optimism Others are a lot more optimistic about BTC’s capabilities. Japan’s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, unveiled a sweeping economic stimulus package that is aimed at easing the burden of inflation on households, a move that some crypto observers believe could channel more capital into Bitcoin. The stimulus plan includes subsidies for electricity and gas bills, as well as regional grants designed to help small and medium-sized businesses raise wages and maintain operations amid rising costs. While the program is intended to offer relief to struggling households, critics argue it could also trigger another round of monetary expansion by Japan’s central bank, which has historically been bullish for Bitcoin. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes was among the first people to weigh in by calling the move a prelude to further fiat money printing by the Bank of Japan. “Translation: let’s print money to hand out to folks to help with food and energy costs,” Hayes wrote on X, and predicted that such a policy could push Bitcoin’s price as high as $1 million while also strengthening the Japanese yen in the short term. His comments came as the yen slipped to a one-week low after Takaichi’s appointment as Japan’s first female prime minister. Many investors see her “pro-stimulus” stance as a potential precursor to a pivot by the Bank of Japan toward quantitative easing, a policy of buying bonds and injecting liquidity into the economy to stimulate growth. Although the Bank of Japan is still in a phase of quantitative tightening, with no official plan to return to QE until inflation stabilizes at 2%, analysts suggest that Takaichi’s policies could accelerate an eventual shift. The central bank’s next policy meeting on Oct. 29 is expected to shed some more light on its direction, though most forecasts anticipate a 0.75% interest rate hike by early 2026. Meanwhile, large Bitcoin holders appear to be growing increasingly bullish. After Bitcoin’s dip to a four-month low of $104,000 last week, several “whales” have returned to the market. According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain , three major wallets deposited tens of millions of dollars onto the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid this week to open leveraged long positions. One of them, identified as “0x3fce,” expanded its Bitcoin position to $49.7 million, while another, “0x89AB,” opened a 6x leveraged long worth $14 million. The renewed whale activity suggests that there is rising confidence that Japan’s stimulus measures could act as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s next major rally.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-23 05:30:00

The Tesla CEO told investors during third-quarter earnings call event that he wanted to “make a point of clarification,” saying both chipmakers will handle the next batch of AI5 production. Tesla depends on these AI chips to power its self-driving software and the Optimus robots it’s still developing.Musk said the company uses the chips alongside Nvidia’s hardware, which leads the market for AI computing processors. Samsung, meanwhile, is chasing TSMC’s dominance in the foundry industry, where chips are made for outside clients. It’s already building a major semiconductor hub near Austin, Texas, not far from Tesla’s own base. Samsung signs $16.5 billion deal and joins Tesla’s AI push Back in July, Elon confirmed that Samsung would also make Tesla’s AI6 chip, the next generation after the AI5. That followed a Cryptopolitan report about a $16.5 billion deal between the two companies, which gave Samsung’s foundry division one of its largest outside orders. Elon had said then that Samsung was already handling the older AI4 chip, while TSMC was responsible for the AI5. The update now means both companies will be producing Tesla’s current AI hardware, splitting the workload across two supply chains. Samsung may still trail TSMC, but this deal gives it a visible foothold in one of the most high-profile chip programs in the world. For Tesla, it means less reliance on a single supplier and more production capacity as the company ramps up development for its autonomous driving software and humanoid robots. Elon didn’t reveal how the chip work will be divided, only saying both partners are “focused initially on AI5.” But the call wasn’t just about chips. Musk completely skipped any update on EV demand, especially after the federal tax credit expired last month. There was no mention of Cybertruck, and he didn’t touch tariffs or fourth-quarter guidance either, which is pretty unusual.. Elon outlines robotaxi rollout and teases new Optimus robot Instead of talking about cars or profits, Elon went straight to his comfort zone; robotaxis and robots. He told investors that the company’s self-driving plans are about to “take off like a shock wave.” Elon claimed Tesla already has “millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars,” adding that Tesla is “making a couple million a year.” He said robotaxi service will begin in Austin by the end of this year, running without human drivers. By late 2025, the service should expand to eight to ten cities, though early versions will still keep drivers on board. Tesla’s Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja added that adoption of FSD Supervised, the company’s partially automated system, remains “small,” with just 12% of users paying for it. He didn’t disclose pricing, only saying Tesla ran several promotions to boost signups. After discussing robotaxis, Elon turned to the Optimus humanoid robot, saying it could become “the biggest product of all time.” The robot isn’t on the market yet, but he described new capabilities, saying “Optimus will be an incredible surgeon.” Elon said that with both Optimus and self-driving tech, “you can actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care.” He also said Tesla would demo a new version called Optimus V3 in the first quarter of 2026, promising significant upgrades from the current prototype. The call ended with him returning to the robot topic over and over again, tying it to his controversial $1 trillion pay package. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

At the time of writing, ZEC is priced at $240, with a 24-hour trading volume of $730 million. Meanwhile, the token is down slightly in the past 24 hours but remains up over 460% over the past month (CoinGecko data). The 24-hour price range shows a high of $308 and a low of $237, indicating high intraday volatility following a sharp rally. Wedge Pattern Approaches Resistance Current chart patterns show ZEC forming an ascending wedge. This structure often appears during strong rallies and typically signals a point where momentum begins to narrow. The price is now approaching a resistance zone between $280 and $313, marked by Murrey Math levels. These levels are often referenced by traders during periods of overextension. Movement into this zone has slowed. If volume increases, the price may test this resistance again. If not, the market may start to turn back toward lower support levels. The closest zones of support on the chart appear at $250 and $220. Source: TradingView In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached 69, close to the typical overbought mark of 70. The 14-day RSI moving average is now at 70, which suggests momentum has stretched. So far, the RSI has not broken above the overbought level. However, staying near these levels may lead to sideways trading as participants wait for a new direction. A short pullback is also a common reaction when RSI hovers at these highs. Multi-Year Breakout Meets Initial Target ZEC recently completed a major technical breakout. According to analyst Javon Marks, the token ended a downtrend that lasted over a year and a half. After the breakout, the price moved quickly toward $308, which matched a key target. Marks stated , “Another >1,000% callout in the books.” A second target has been placed near $596.65, though this remains above current levels. The move followed a period of low resistance and accelerating buying volume. The price has not yet shown any extended correction, though activity near $308 may lead to consolidation. Futures Interest and Mixed Market Sentiment According to Coinglass, open interest in ZEC futures reached $306.3 million, rising from under $50 million in September. This sharp increase reflects a surge in speculative participation. Such growth often coincides with higher volatility and larger position sizes. Source: Coinglass Market sentiment remains split. Analyst Henry wrote , “ZEC looks cooked. $311 wick was the exit liquidity.” He also added that failure to hold above $300 could lead to moves toward the mid-$240 range. He referenced a possible head and shoulders pattern forming, while noting that bulls would need to act quickly to change momentum. As CryptoPotato posted on X, Zcash founder Zooko responded to recent price speculation by saying, “I don’t know why the Zcash price has been skyrocketing. And I don’t know if it is going to go back down.” He also dismissed suggestions of coordinated market manipulation, calling them “ just more cynical propaganda .” The post ZEC Hits $308 Then Dumps Hard: What’s Next for This Breakout? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Zcash (ZEC) Price,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|ZEC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-23 05:35:33

The figure marks a dramatic jump from just four months back when the company was worth far less. The company’s value has climbed fast this year. Back in June, Polymarket secured $200 million from investors led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund. At that time, the startup was valued at $1 billion. Then earlier this month, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., which runs the New York Stock Exchange, announced plans to put up to $2 billion into Polymarket. That deal priced the company at around $8 billion before counting the new money coming in. The transaction also made Shayne Coplan, Polymarket’s chief executive, the youngest person to become a billionaire through building their own business. Kalshi valuation race heats up Meanwhile, Kalshi, which competes directly with Polymarket, is getting offers from investors who want in at valuations above $10 billion. According to Bloomberg, that would be more than twice what the company was worth in a funding deal announced just weeks ago. The rapid rise in these valuations shows how much excitement there is around this young industry where betting and finance are coming together. Both Polymarket and Kalshi have seen betting activity jump recently as reported by Cryptopolitan . During the week that ended October 19, total trading hit more than $2 billion across both platforms. That beat the earlier record set during last year’s presidential election. Wall Street giants rush to partner with prediction markets Big financial firms and gambling companies are paying attention. They’re making deals with these prediction market leaders, betting the newcomers might reshape their businesses. On Wednesday, Coplan said Polymarket would serve as a clearinghouse for DraftKings Inc. as that company enters prediction markets. The same day, the National Hockey League announced multi-year agreements with both Kalshi and Polymarket , making it the first big American sports league to partner with these platforms. Still, prediction markets face unclear rules ahead. While federal regulators have let Kalshi open new markets, state gambling officials have fought back in court. Questions about market manipulation and insider trading also remain unresolved.

A survey of 50 economists showed that most of them think the BOJ will wait till December to change its rates. Only 10% of economists think the Bank of Japan will raise rates on October 30, down from 36% before. Takaichi’s leadership makes the BOJ more cautious about raising rates Sanae Takaichi won the leadership race of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and became Japan’s new Prime Minister . Experts say the BOJ won’t rush to make any changes to its interest rates because the new Prime Minister has consistently supported keeping rates low, allowing more money to flow into the economy. She did not specify when or how the central bank should react. Still, people expect that she prefers stability over sudden financial tightening, given her popular views and long-standing political history. Before Takaichi came to office, people thought the BOJ would raise interest rates in October, but now they expect it to wait until December or even next year. Economists say the bank will cooperate with the government to avoid any disagreements, as the Prime Minister favors long-term support for growth through low borrowing costs. Senior economist at Sompo Institute Plus, Masato Koike, said, “Takaichi is probably thinking a rate hike is undesirable even after she’s softened her tone.” Experts say policymakers at the BOJ will tread carefully because they don’t want the public and investors to think the bank is going against the wishes of the government. Cooperation between the bank and the government will ensure that investors remain confident and that the country’s economic status remains stable. According to a new survey, 72% of economists said that the chances of the BOJ raising its interest rates in October have decreased significantly, largely due to the political change. More than half of the survey respondents stated that the bank could harm its relationship and cooperation with the new government if it were to increase interest rates now. Analysts say that the central bank will be very careful in how it communicates to the public, so that markets don’t misunderstand its goals and avoid spreading confusion among investors. Before Takaichi, many economists predicted that the central bank would issue an interest rate of about 1.25%, but that figure has now dropped to 1%. The market can already feel her influence in the way experts talk about Japan’s monetary policy, and many people say her leadership will have a great influence on how and when the BOJ acts in the months ahead. BOJ struggles to control yen weakness while calming market doubts The BOJ is facing a weak yen, a volatile market, and a new government under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Masamichi Adachi, Chief Japan economist at UBS Securities and a former Bank of Japan official, said the BOJ should raise its rates. He explained that the bank needs to show the public that it is serious about moving away from years of the same low interest rates. However, making a move right now could cause unexpected changes in the yen and bond markets, as people have very low expectations of an interest rate spike. Adachi said the bank doesn’t want to surprise investors because the market isn’t well prepared for such changes, and so it will most likely postpone its new rates. All eyes are currently on the BOJ as it plans to announce its quarterly economic outlook and policy decision next week. Many experts believe the bank will not make significant changes to its economic and inflation forecast from the previous report. They believe the central bank will only make a minor upward adjustment to indicate some improvement in exports and business investments, but inflation statistics will remain unchanged. Senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management, Katsutoshi Inadome, said the central bank should maintain steady interest rates for now, while still sounding confident about the chances of a future hike. He explained that the BOJ will prevent the yen from weakening too much before its next rate hike if it conveys a hawkish hold in its report. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

53526010,https://cryptonews.com/?p=442300,1761198547,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53526010.jpeg,"Crypto Lost 1,000 Jobs To AI Since ChatGPT Debut, Yet Hiring Recovered: A16z",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-jobs-lost-to-ai-since-chatgpt-debut-yet-hiring-recovered-a16z/,"Crypto’s workforce took an early hit from the artificial intelligence boom, but has since rebounded, according to Andreessen Horowitz’s State of Crypto 2025 report released Wednesday. The firm found that around 1,000 jobs have shifted from crypto companies to AI startups since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, but an equivalent number of professionals have joined the industry from other sectors. The report analyzed job movements from Nov. 2022 to Sept. 2025 and showed that crypto has lost workers to AI startups, which continue to attract technical talent. However, the sector has replenished its ranks with new hires from technology, finance, consulting and education. Roughly 12,000 people moved into or out of crypto roles during that period, suggesting a dynamic and fluid job market. AI Lured Builders Away, But Crypto Recovered Hiring Momentum From Other Industries A16z said crypto gained about 1,000 net jobs from other industries even as AI pulled away a similar number of employees. The largest inflows came from tech firms, which contributed over 12,000 professionals, followed by finance and consulting with around 6,000. Smaller inflows came from education and other sectors. The shift shows the increasingly intertwined relationship between crypto and AI. Since ChatGPT’s debut, AI has drawn both capital and talent across the tech landscape. Many developers have pivoted to AI projects, while others have found new opportunities in crypto’s resurgent markets. ChatGPT’s arrival in Nov. 2022 coincided with one of crypto’s darkest periods, marked by the collapse of FTX and a sharp contraction in venture funding. At the time, job losses, declining token prices, and regulatory uncertainty shook the industry’s confidence. AI Consolidates Power While Crypto Continues To Champion Decentralization: A16z Today, the landscape looks very different. The global crypto market capitalization has surpassed US$4 trillion, with Bitcoin reaching new record highs this year. The rebound comes amid a friendlier regulatory tone from the Trump administration, which has supported legislation for stablecoins and digital asset oversight. Institutional adoption is also deepening as firms such as JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Fidelity expand their crypto offerings. A16z’s analysis shows that much of the new hiring in crypto now comes from professionals with finance and fintech backgrounds, reflecting the sector’s gradual convergence with traditional financial systems. The firm noted that crypto’s talent pipeline is diversifying beyond developers, with growing demand for compliance, infrastructure, and product specialists. At the same time, AI’s growth has raised questions about centralization and market concentration. The report said OpenAI and Anthropic control 88% of all revenue from AI-native companies, while Amazon, Microsoft, and Google hold 63% of the cloud infrastructure market. NVIDIA continues to dominate hardware with a 94% share of data center GPUs. This concentration, A16z noted, contrasts sharply with the decentralized ethos of crypto. Crypto Standards Are Evolving To Let AI Agents Transact And Access Data Without Intermediaries Blockchains, the firm said, could serve as a counterweight to AI’s centralizing forces by powering open networks, verifiable compute, and transparent data systems. Emerging crypto standards such as x402 aim to support autonomous AI agents, enabling them to perform microtransactions and access APIs without intermediaries — a market Gartner expects could reach $30 trillion by 2030. Meanwhile, A16z identified stablecoins as one of the strongest signals of crypto’s maturity. The report found that stablecoins processed about $9 trillion in the past 12 months, an 87% jump from a year earlier. That figure represents more than half of Visa’s annual payments volume and more than five times PayPal’s. The report said that although AI drew away some of crypto’s early talent, the industry’s rebound and growing presence among major institutions point to a clear return of confidence.

Two Whales Have Accumulated Over 1.4 Million Links in Recent Months According to the data, the whale with the address 0xf386 withdrew 62,207 LINK (approximately $1.07 million) from the OKX exchange approximately five hours ago. With this latest transaction, the amount of LINK accumulated by that address over the past five months has reached approximately 1.1 million units (approximately $19 million). Similarly, another whale with the address 0xe8aa withdrew 66,113 LINK (approximately $1.14 million) from the Kraken exchange 14 hours ago. This address's total LINK haul over the past month brings the total amount to 307,684 LINK (approximately $5.34 million). The accumulation of LINK by large investors in recent weeks, according to on-chain data, suggests a renewed surge in institutional interest. Chainlink's efforts, particularly in the integration of DeFi and real-world assets (RWA), support long-term confidence in the project. According to experts, this accumulation process demonstrates that LINK has strong fundamental value despite market-wide volatility. Increased whale buying could contribute to price stability and usher in a potential future uptrend. Finally, the Chainlink ecosystem has been keeping investor interest alive recently with developments in both staking programs and data oracle solutions. *This is not investment advice.

Related Reading: Fetch.AI CEO Offers Reward To ‘Uncover’ Ocean Protocol’s Alleged $120M FET Dump Spot Market Sees Strong Q3 Performance On Wednesday, crypto exchange MEXC published its Q3 2025 Ecosystem & Growth Report, highlighting sustained expansion, robust user activity, and security from the previous quarter. According to the report, the exchange experienced strong activity and trading momentum during the market run between July and September, with over 680 new tokens added to the crypto exchange in Q3, representing a 17% increase from Q2. Moreover, the number of active users trading new listings in the exchange increased 16%, while the trading volume for these tokens surged 97%. The report also noted that the spot market had a “particularly robust” performance last quarter, with the top 10 highest-volume tokens recording an average peak gain of 2,933%, a 158% jump from Q2. Notably, memecoins, AI + Web3, Perpetual Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), and stablecoin protocols were among the dominant narratives, with tokens like STBL, Chainbase (C), and DeAgentAI (AIA) showing remarkable 500% to 12,00% performances. Meanwhile, the BSC ecosystem outperformed all other ecosystems, taking six of the top 10 tokens by growth in the crypto exchange. The report detailed that BSC projects produced an average return of over 9,000%, including TALE, BAS, and MEAL. It’s worth noting that the BSC outperformed other networks in DEX activity earlier this month, with data showing that it recently ranked first across all chains, surpassing Ethereum and Solana on DEX daily trading and chain fees. Additionally, BSC reached a new all-time high (ATH) of 5.02 trillion gas used in a single day two weeks ago. MEXC also highlighted that BSC’s strength was matched by the Ethereum and Base ecosystems, which recorded strong performance with GAIA, ERA, and Avantis (AVNT), “representing the growing cross-chain vitality of Layer-2 and DeFi derivative protocols.” Crypto Losses Trend Slows Down The report revealed that the crypto exchange intercepted 48 fraud cases last quarter, freezing nearly $5 million in illicit funds. As part of its efforts to prevent fraud, it also restricted more than 19,000 suspicious accounts, including 17,000 collusive accounts and over 2,000 bot-trading accounts. Notably, a concerning trend that has been developing this year, which could drive theft from digital asset services to a new milestone by the end of 2025. According to Chainalysis, crypto theft this year has been “more devastating” than the entirety of 2024, with over $2.7 billion worth of funds stolen from crypto services in the first half of 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Eyes $114,000 Retest Amid Bounce, But Analyst Suggests Caution As reported by NewsBTC, hacks significantly increase at the start of Q3, driving over $100 million in losses for exchanges. Q2 showed a diminishing trend in total crypto losses, with May and June recording 40% and 56% month-on-month (MoM) declines, respectively. This trend briefly shifted in July as the total value of stolen funds surged 27.2% from the previous month. Nonetheless, recent reports show that total funds lost to crypto hacks and exploits dropped around 37% in Q3, despite the market rally and initial trend.

53526539,612032,1761199233,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Ethereum Market Outlook: $4,100 Resistance Holds as BlackRock and Major Funds Boost Exposure",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-market-outlook-as-the-4100-resistance-hold/,"After two weeks of a disappointing run, Ethereum (ETH) is once again capturing institutional interest as major funds and asset managers step into the smart-contract platform. According to recent data, Bitmine Immersion Technologies purchased approximately $251 million worth of ETH, adding 63,539 tokens to its portfolio and bringing its holdings to over 3 million ETH ($13 billion). Institutional Capital Flows Bolster Ethereum’s Bullish Case BlackRock’s clients have added $41.91 million in Ethereum , marking another sign of growing institutional adoption. These inflows come as Ethereum breaks out of a descending trendline pattern and parallels the rally seen in gold, with ETH’s correlation to gold reaching 0.7 in Q3 2025, driven by ETF inflows and DeFi-driven growth. On-chain metrics further reinforce this accumulation narrative. Wallets are moving more ETH off exchanges, signaling long-term holding behavior, while tokenization and DeFi usage on Ethereum’s network continue to expand meaningfully. Institutions appear to be treating Ethereum not just as a speculative bet, but increasingly as a foundational infrastructure asset, particularly given Ethereum’s post-Proof-of-Stake upgrade energy efficiency and suitability for ESG mandates. Ethereum Holds $4,100 Resistance, Eyes on $4,440 From a technical vantage, Ethereum is testing the key resistance zone near $4,100–$4,440. Analysts like Ali Martinez point out the recent breakout of the descending trendline provides a bullish structural shift, but only if support levels remain intact. The most critical support lies near $3,800, with a deeper fallback to $3,600 if momentum fades. A sustained move above $4,440 could unlock a run toward $4,800–$5,000, provided institutional flows and macro conditions align. Conversely, a close below $3,800 would weaken the momentum thesis and potentially invite a retracement toward $3,560 or lower. With ETF flows, macro liquidity, and network fundamentals converging, Ethereum is showing a rare blend of structural strength, but execution is key. The near-term jury is out until Ethereum closes decisively above $4,100 with volume confirming the move.

Ethereum (ETH) and Chainlink are holding strong support levels, indicating renewed confidence in the market. Traders are now searching for the best altcoins to buy that show signs of an early opportunity, before the next wave of inflows starts. Market sentiment is still cautious, but analysts see increasing accumulation in a number of high-potential projects. Hyperliquid, MAGACOINFINANCE , and Avalanche are drawing attention with their solid fundamentals, steady growth, and growing participation by their communities. All of these coins are some of the best altcoins to buy before the rotation of capital picks up. Ethereum Price Analysis: Leading the Best Altcoins to Buy Ethereum Price continues to face pressure at a key support level, with traders observing for any signs of reversal. ETH was trading at nearly $3,945 at the time of writing, far below the all-time high of $4,963. The setup presents a potential upside even after this pullback as long as support holds. Source: TradingView The three-day chart displays ETH dipping from $4,963 to $3,930, but it remains bullish above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. Also, it’s above the pivot reversal level on the Murrey Math Lines tool, indicating that buyers are holding on to some key territory. ETH is currently trading close to a major swing level established during previous cycles just below $4,087, but is still holding above the Supertrend indicator. A new bullish flag formation is developing, which may break out to $5000. The bullish view would fade only if the price drops below $3,500. The fundamentals of Ethereum are still strong. The network recorded over $1 trillion in stablecoin transactions this month. Transaction volumes increased to 25.9 million, while revenue increased to $16.8 million. These figures prove that Ethereum remains one of the best altcoins to buy before the next leg higher. Chainlink (LINK) Holds Support Before Q4 Rotation Chainlink is trading in a descending channel and has bounced off the lower side of the channel around $16.60 recently. This is typically the end of a corrective phase, as buyers are starting to come back into the market. The price has been heading toward $18, with resistance levels at $20.02, $23.75, and $27.81. Source: TradinView A bullish continuation can be confirmed by a breakout above $20, and near resistance, the rejection can lead to short-term consolidation. Exchange reserves reduced by 6.18% to about $2.88 billion, which shows holders moving LINK off exchanges and reducing supply. Strong whale accumulation around $16 and long-side dominance on the futures data indicate increasing optimism. The scarcity of the supply can position Chainlink as one of the best altcoins to buy before Q4 rotation starts to accelerate. MAGACOIN FINANCE Sparks FOMO Among Early Buyers In the face of Q4 rotation expectations, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing strong attention from investors who are positioning before the next wave. Whale activity indicates initial accumulation over multiple wallets, suggesting increased conviction. Retail traders are doing the same by rushing to grab the last of the tokens before prices increase further. The tightening supply has led to clear signs of FOMO across the community, as engagement and transactions have seen a sharp increase. Analysts also suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s transparency, early-stage development, and clear roadmap towards growth make it an attractive choice for investors looking to get an early start in the next phase of the market. Those who position early may get more upside potential as liquidity and awareness build up over the rotation cycle. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Buybacks Strengthen One of the Best Altcoins to Buy Hyperliquid moves closer to a breakout as steady buyback, strong on-chain growth, and strong fundamentals keep the market’s confidence. The project has bought back more than $521 million worth of HYPE, burning 5.6% of the circulating supply. Source: Tokenomist Another $3 million was repurchased yesterday, for a total of $108 million in one month. These consistent buybacks reduce the liquidity in the market, which results in a stable price in case of corrections. The activation of HyperEVM has further added to the current optimism as the ecosystem grows. Support between $34 and $37 has continued to hold for a solid foundation for a breakout. Hyperliquid is one of the best altcoins to buy before the rally in Q4 due to its strong fundamentals and consistent demand. Avalanche (AVAX) Rebuilds Momentum Ahead of Q4 Rotation After weeks of trading sideways, Avalanche is regaining strength, backed by improving technicals and on-chain stability. Historically, AVAX has done well toward the end of the year, and that trend may repeat itself as sentiment improves. The Decentralized Autonomous Treasuries (DATs) narrative has brought a new enthusiasm to the Avalanche ecosystem. AVAX regained $20.7 and is consolidating above the Bollinger mid-band, where RSI is headed for 45. Open interest has fallen to $507 million, the lowest it’s been in three months, which indicates a cleaner market with fewer levers. This configuration raises the chances of having a sustainable uptrend. If AVAX trades above $19.7, then the next resistance levels are $26 and $28. Source: X Conclusion Ethereum and Chainlink continue to show resilience and hold strong technical points. Their ability to hold key levels is allowing the maintenance of overall market sentiment stability in anticipation of the expected Q4 rotation. Hyperliquid, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are currently attracting more capital as investors position themselves for the next phase of market growth. With the early accumulation phase and solid fundamentals, these projects are among the best altcoins to buy before Q4 inflows accelerate.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-expert-to-xrp-holders-this-is-not-real-life-heres-why/,"Levi Rietveld of Crypto Crusaders has recently shared his excitement for XRP’s future. In a new video, he discussed the latest geopolitical developments between the U.S. and China, emphasizing how these shifts could signal a reversal for digital assets such as XRP. His remarks came after President Donald Trump announced that Chinese President Xi Jinping was open to a new trade deal. Rietveld reminded viewers that only a week earlier, markets had reacted sharply to news of Trump’s plan to impose a 100% tariff on China. He noted that this move had “eviscerated” the entire crypto market and that the effects of that announcement were still visible today. Bitcoin, which had reached an all-time high of $126,000 before the sell-off, and XRP fell below $2 for the first time since June and have yet to regain their prior levels. This Is Not Real Life #XRP pic.twitter.com/8uhpocmYB1 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 20, 2025 Reversal Momentum Gaining Strength According to Rietveld, the damage from the tariff announcement remains factored into prices, but the recent softening in tone from both leaders could quickly change that. He suggested that the market has room to rebound as assets have not fully recovered. His assessment positions the current environment as one of potential recovery rather than ongoing weakness. The shift in rhetoric between the U.S. and China may restore confidence that had recently been shaken. Investors and traders who had taken a cautious stance are now closely watching for any policy progress that might validate Rietveld’s outlook. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Participation on the Horizon Rietveld also noted that “institutions are getting ready to open up and go into crypto en masse,” a statement that adds further optimism to his analysis. Institutional entry has long been a defining factor for sustained growth and legitimacy within the digital asset market. A renewed inflow of institutional capital could amplify momentum in leading cryptocurrencies such as XRP, particularly if market conditions stabilize after the recent geopolitical turbulence. Rietveld’s outlook reflects a belief that sentiment is shifting from uncertainty toward opportunity. XRP could benefit strongly from renewed investor confidence once conditions normalize. If the trade environment improves and institutional activity increases, the digital asset could kickstart the broader market rebound Rietveld anticipates.

Further caution prevailed ahead of key U.S. inflation data and next week’s Fed policy meeting. Gold prices fell to around $4,080 per ounce on Thursday, extending its decline for a third straight session amid continued selling pressure after repeatedly hitting record highs in recent weeks. Singapore's annual inflation rate edged up to 0.7% in September 2025, picking up from a more than four-year low of 0.5% in the previous month and slightly above market expectations of 0.6%. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 1.42% dropped 1.3% to below 48,700 while the broader Topix Index fell 0.6% to 3,245 on Thursday. The Japanese yen weakened past 152 per dollar on Thursday, nearing eight-month lows, amid growing speculation that new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will unveil a large-scale stimulus package as early as next month. In Japan, investors weighed the policy outlook amid speculation that new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is preparing a major stimulus package exceeding last year’s 13.9 trillion yen. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan is widely anticipated to keep rates unchanged next week, with markets now projecting the next hike in January. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.83% to below 3,890 while the Shenzhen Component dropped 1.3% to 12,830 on Thursday, marking a second straight session of losses as trade and policy uncertainties dampened sentiment, and the offshore yuan Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.25% to 25,601 on Thursday morning, down for the second day after Wall Street weakened overnight. Investors also turned cautious ahead of Hong Kong’s September inflation data due later today. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.86% to 85,196 in morning trade on Thursday, extending gains from the Muhurat ""special"" trading day on Tuesday and hitting its highest level since September 26, 2024, buoyed by renewed foreign inflows. Meanwhile, the Nifty 50 climbed above the milestone 26,000 mark for the first time since September 30, 2024. The Indian rupee traded around 87.7 per USD, holding near a one-month-high, as markets returned from a two-day break to signs of improving US–India trade ties. Indian state refiners are reviewing their Russian oil trade documents to ensure that no supplies are sourced directly from Rosneft and Lukoil, following U.S. sanctions imposed on both companies, a source with direct knowledge told Reuters on Wednesday. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.03% to around 9,000 in Thursday morning trade, extending losses from the previous session, dragged down by mining and tech stocks. The Australian dollar In the U.S. on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended lower following reports that the White House may restrict exports to China involving US software. President Donald Trump later said his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping is “scheduled,” easing some tension over US-China ties.

However, we are holding Bitcoin while shorting MicroStrategy. It was an arbitrage strategy,” Chanos said in an interview. The renowned investor argued that he found it unreasonable that shares of companies holding Bitcoin treasury were trading at a high premium compared to the value of the Bitcoin they held: “It's not rational for investors to see companies holding Bitcoin holdings generate a premium on their shares solely because of this. MicroStrategy is the most well-known example, but we believe investors who want to buy Bitcoin should buy it at $1, not $1.40.” Related News: Critical Date Set for Altcoin Project That Vitalik Buterin Invested In Chanos also noted that MicroStrategy’s premium to net asset value (NAV) ratio fell from 1.9 to 1.4, while other companies with similar structures fell below 1.0: “MicroStrategy is still holding at 1.4, but that gap will close over time.

The company’s quarterly report , released on Oct. 22, showed that it continues to hold 11,509 Bitcoin, now valued at $1.31b. The figure marks an increase from $1.23b in the previous quarter, driven entirely by Bitcoin’s price appreciation. Tesla’s holdings have not changed since early 2022, but their valuation has climbed sharply alongside the broader crypto rally this year. JUST IN: Elon Musk's Tesla did not sell any of its $1.3 billion Bitcoin in Q3 pic.twitter.com/D6GKMOXQXO — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) October 22, 2025 Revised Accounting Lifts Tesla’s Q3 Bitcoin Valuation To Its Highest Level In Four Years Tesla began using new fair-value accounting rules earlier this year, which require its digital asset holdings to be reported at current market prices rather than at historical cost. The adjustment allowed the company to recognize the $80m gain under “other income,” its strongest quarter for Bitcoin revaluation since 2021. Its current holdings make it the 11th largest corporate Bitcoin owner in the world, ranking behind MicroStrategy, Galaxy Digital, and Block but ahead of Hut 8 Mining and other institutions. It was also Tesla’s second consecutive quarter of Bitcoin gains, reflecting the recovery in digital asset markets through 2025. Tesla Says Surge In R&D And AI Investment Drove 50% Jump In Operating Costs Bitcoin-related gains and losses are not included in Tesla’s adjusted earnings per share. The company reported total revenue of $25.18b, up from a year earlier. Automotive revenue rose 6% to $21.2b, while total net income fell 37% to $1.37b, or 39 cents per share, compared with $2.17b, or 62 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. Tesla attributed the decline in profitability to lower electric vehicle prices and higher operating costs, which rose by more than 50%. The company said the increase was partly due to investments in artificial intelligence and other research and development projects. The report signals Tesla’s continued long-term view on Bitcoin, which the company has previously described as “a liquid alternative to cash.” It has not made any new purchases since early 2022, when it briefly sold a portion of its holdings to test liquidity before reclassifying Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset. Automaker Keeps Bitcoin Holdings Steady Despite Volatile Market Swings Since 2021 Purchase Tesla first purchased $1.5b worth of Bitcoin in Feb. 2021, a move that marked one of the earliest corporate endorsements of the cryptocurrency by a major US public company. Since then, the automaker has kept its digital asset position stable despite periods of significant market volatility. Meanwhile, a wallet linked to SpaceX, another Musk-led company, moved about $268m worth of Bitcoin to two addresses on Tuesday, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. On-chain analyst Ai Yi said the transactions followed a three-month pause and were likely part of internal fund management rather than an asset sale.

The fall for Bitcoin and Gold has been attributed to profit-taking across the market. The HYPE token sustained growth amid a broader bearish market sentiment, following the reverse merger between Sonnet Bio Therapeutics and a private entity, Rorschach I LLC, valued at $888 million, which created Hyperliquid Strategies Inc. (HSI). The newly formed company will manage a digital asset treasury, acquiring more HYPE tokens. HYPE token jumps over 7% today as Bitcoin slumps over 2% this week Based on CoinMarketCap data , Hyperliquid’s native token HYPE has climbed over 7% today, trading at $37.24, which represents a 7.25% jump over the past 24 hours at the time of publication. Bitcoin, on the other hand, slumped throughout this week with a 2.07% drop and struggles today with a positive 0.33% change, trading at $108,848.27 at the time of publication. The bearish sentiment has also caught up with Gold, which has experienced a sudden drop this week after a sustained period of bullish momentum. The metal price declined by over 5% this week and continued to drop by 0.2% today . According to a filing to the SEC on October 22, Hyperliquid Strategies Inc. will launch a digital asset treasury platform, valuing it at roughly $583 million in HYPE. The firm will raise an additional 1$ billion through an offering of 160 million new shares. A portion of the funds will be used to purchase additional HYPE tokens. Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUCoin, noted that when a digital asset treasury buys a significant amount of an asset, that’s a bullish signal as institutions tend to hold longer than retail investors, which provides stability and long-term confidence. Institutional investors have increased their exposure to DeFi projects significantly through Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, primarily driven by the search for yield and diversification. According to a recent Cryptopolitan report , BTC and ETH ETFs have continued to experience sustained outflows, which may have contributed to the current bearish sentiment surrounding these tokens. SoSoValue data shows that US BTC ETFs have shed off roughly $101.29 million as of today, while US ETH ETFs have experienced $18.77 million in outflows. Despite that, trading volumes have remained strong, suggesting that investors are reallocating funds towards more flexible alternatives. Hyperliquid Strategies’ merger boosts HYPE’s institutional appeal Hyperliquid Strategies Inc. (HSI) appeals to Hyperliquid’s perpetual futures model, which allows investors to speculate with leverage while maintaining token custody. The approach taps into centralized efficiency and blockchain transparency. HYPE has continued to receive validation from other established DeFi infrastructures. For instance, early this month, the MetaMask exchange added native support for Hyperliquid swaps, which allows users to make trades directly from their wallets, thereby expanding HYPE’s accessibility. The latest merger involving Sonnet Bio Therapeutics and Rorschach I LLC deepens the institutional validation of the ecosystem and may potentially transform Hyperliquid into a recognized institutional trading venue. Amid HYPE’s growth, BNB Chain’s Aster has lost over 40% of its value this month. Aster had maintained competition as one of the top-performing DEX tokens, offering competition to HYPE. The token peaked near $2.5 last month but has since been dropping, losing 42% of its value this month and 4.5% today alone, trading at $1. The Ethereum token has shed over 7% this month, currently trading below its September highs of over $4,000. The token was volatile, maintaining a positive 0.33% change over the past 24 hours, trading at $3,881.14 at the time of publication. The token’s market cap has also dropped below half a billion, trading at just $467 billion with a sustained daily average volume of $42.62 billion. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2027, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $7,791.89 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May, while it marked a new ATH of $858.34 on July 28. In August, BNB broke its own record and discovered several new all-time highs when BNB increased to $899.77 on August 22, showing significant growth. On September 21, BNB achieved the mark of $1,079.07, and in October, it discovered a new all-time high price of 1,261.53 and is trading above the $1,200 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-23 07:20:23

The beleaguered crypto platform recently secured approval from the Singapore High Court for its long-awaited debt restructuring plan. The exchange has spent over a year navigating restructuring and restoring user balances following the $230 million hack in July 2024. On Thursday, a company release shared with Cryptonews said that the relaunch will begin in a “phased launch approach”. It will initially start with certain crypto-to-crypto pairs and USDT/INR pair, followed by “gradual expansion” into additional markets in the coming days. WazirX founder, Nischal Shetty, announced that the funds page is live with “rebalanced tokens.” Further, the INR and crypto deposits are open. “We’re now working on withdrawals and trading.

This will apply to all trading pairs, the release noted. “At the heart of everything we do is our mission to make crypto accessible to every Indian,” said Shetty. Besides, he said that the platform is working towards the issuance of Recovery Tokens to creditors. These tokens are intended to represent each Scheme Creditor’s share of illiquid and stolen assets. This means that the tokens will be issued to creditors based on the value of their relevant claims. “WazirX is able to restart operations and initiate token distributions to creditors within 10 business days as estimated,” Shetty added. Additionally, the exchange has partnered with crypto custody firm BitGo for asset security as it restarts. “Our partnership with BitGo adds an additional layer of trust and protection with world-class custody standards, as we restart. This isn’t just a return to operations, it’s a reinforcement of our integrity, which we’ve always strived for.” The post WazirX to Resume Operations on Oct. 24, Promises Token Payouts to Creditors Within 10 Days appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|India|Wazirx,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-23 07:22:12

As the world’s largest lender, Beijing is now handing out favors… with strings. Countries deep in debt to China are being nudged into ditching the dollar, not by force, but through a well-timed play: offering cheaper financing in yuan, China’s own currency. That’s exactly what Ethiopia is now doing. This week, it started talks to convert part of its $5.38 billion debt into yuan-denominated loans. And Ethiopia isn’t alone. Others are already in. Kenya said earlier this month it shaved $215 million off annual debt payments after converting Chinese railway loans from dollars to yuan. “If the borrowers pay less, then the lender gets less,” said Michael Pettis, senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment. “The benefit for China in exchange for less revenue is that the renminbi becomes a more internationally-used currency.” Beijing cuts revenue to push yuan deeper into trade and debt This whole strategy, swapping dollar loans into yuan, means China is taking a loss upfront. But long-term, it lets Beijing get what it really wants: more global use of its currency. According to Bloomberg, the goal is to help countries use yuan to pay for Chinese goods, and push the currency into trade settlement and financing. The deal structure isn’t just for Africa. These conversions could soon stretch to countries across Asia, Eastern Europe, and beyond. “China’s concern is that US control of the main international currency gives it strategic leverage,” Pettis added . Basically, Beijing doesn’t want to keep playing on America’s field. This push helps it blunt Washington’s grip on global finance. China’s economic slowdown, low interest rates, and persistent deflation make its money cheaper. The U.S., still stuck with higher rates, makes the yuan more attractive to borrowers. And after Trump’s chaos tariffs, erratic policy, and record high U.S. debt, some investors just want out of the dollar. This year alone, Hungary and Kazakhstan sold yuan bonds, while Sri Lanka took a $500 million yuan loan for a highway project. Indonesia is now planning its first offshore yuan bond. As of October, over 68 billion yuan ($9.5 billion) in debt and loans had been issued, twice what was done in all of 2024, Bloomberg data shows. Zambia, another country drowning in Chinese debt, is watching closely. “Anything that reduces the debt burden of Zambia—saves money in a true sense—that is something that is of course always interesting,” said Finance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane. No decision yet, but eyes are locked on Kenya’s deal. China expands yuan ecosystem through swaps, bonds, and fast payments Beijing’s Foreign Ministry hasn’t confirmed anything directly, but said it wants “practical cooperation” with African nations and plans to help them achieve “independent and sustainable development.” In the background, about 30 countries now have bilateral currency swap deals with China’s central bank, helping local banks access yuan more easily. “China is trying to establish an ecosystem for the yuan with more scenarios where it can be used,” said Ding Shuang, chief economist for greater China at Standard Chartered. That means more trade in yuan, more countries holding it, and more financial products priced in it. The opportunity is massive. According to Kevin Gallagher of Boston University, the world’s 78 poorest countries owe around $67 billion to China. That’s a lot of leverage. “If China refinances its debt to countries for longer terms and lower interest rates, it will give these countries much-needed fiscal space,” Gallagher said. Even with all this, results have been mixed. Capital controls and strict management of the exchange rate have limited how far the yuan can go. But China isn’t standing still. The PBOC has opened up access to its repurchase markets, launched a fast payment system with Hong Kong, and kept its currency stable even with low yields. Meanwhile, the dollar has lost 7.5% of its value this year. Its status as a safe haven is under pressure. Trump’s tariffs and the U.S. debt pile are only making things worse. And China? It’s buying gold, hedging, and slowly de-dollarizing. “China and other non-Western countries will find ways to incrementally reduce their reliance on the dollar,” said Gabriel Wildau of Teneo. “Yuan payments are becoming an increasingly viable backup option.” Beijing’s endgame is to break the current dollar monopoly and build a multi-currency world. A world where yuan has real power. PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng wrote recently that the system could “evolve toward a structure where a few sovereign currencies coexist, compete, and counterbalance each other.” Still, not everyone’s convinced. “This interest rate configuration is unlikely to remain unchanged forever,” said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia-Pacific economist at S&P. “Other factors are needed to drive a comprehensive structural trend towards yuan internationalization, including easier access for foreigners to China’s financial markets.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Among the top cryptocurrencies fitting this profile are Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . XRP’s institutional backing and ETF-speculation may make it a 5- to 10-fold mover if major approvals drop. DOGE, the meme-coin OG, still boasts brand recognition and could surge with viral momentum. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out among early-stage DeFi protocols, priced at $0.035 in phase 6 of its presale which is over 70% sold out, giving it a lower entry point and theoretically higher upside. Together, these three coins present a diversified mix of stability (XRP), community-driven growth (DOGE), and early-stage speculative leverage (MUTM). Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Forecast: Bulls Having Trouble Fight at $0.20 Dogecoin (DOGE) is struggling to overcome the important $0.20 resistance level, which is equivalent to a point of former control and various earlier areas of rejection. Although it has rebounded lately, meager trading volume implies enthusiasm on the part of buyers is in short supply, leaving room for a return to $0.15, a high-time-frame area of accumulation. For DOGE to validate a continuation of the uptrend, the price must experience a daily close above $0.20 with strong volume support, which can lay the groundwork for a trip to $0.26. While traders focus on these levels, even greater interest is attracted to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), gaining increasing attention on the route to the 2025–2026 cycle and being highlighted among the top cryptocurrencies of the upcoming bull run. Ripple (XRP) Price Outlook: Recovery Gains Traction Above Important Support XRP is posting preliminary indications of a possible rebound following the rebound from the $2.50 support level. The RSI has already started to move up from oversold conditions, indicating growing buying pressure, with the MACD also starting to move in the direction of the bull, both of which indicate a possible short-term reversal of momentum. So long as XRP can remain above $2.60, it could validate a short-term bullish configuration that would set the stage for a move up towards the $3.00 resistance. But they need to be cautious since a break of the uptrend would leave the token vulnerable to bear pressures around the $2.40 support. As optimism in markets gradually sets in, investors monitoring the recovery of XRP are also watching out for high-potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) within the DeFi sector that is quickly attracting more eyes prior to 2026’s soon-to-commence large-scale market cycle, and becoming one of the best cryptos to buy now. Mutuum Finance Sets New Presale Record Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most important cryptos to invest in today. Its presale is still on an upward trajectory with more than 17,370 investors already participating with over $17.75 million. The token is currently on offer at its cheapest price of $0.035 in Stage 6 of the presale, and it is a good entry point for early adopters seeking exposure to the top cryptocurrencies before the next bull market takes off. Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway , to start building its community. 10 investors will receive $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. The giveaway, apart from winning new investors, shows the project is committed to doing the extra work to secure a long-term community, further strengthening its image among the best cryptos to buy now. CertiK smart contract audit has rated Mutuum Finance (MUTM) secure, and its trust rating is 90/100. The venture is offering a completely secure platform to execute DeFi transactions. The idea that has been proposed in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is to connect emerging lending capacity with the power of an ecosystem, and with a vision to shape the future of DeFi, establishing it as one of the top cryptocurrencies redefining the decentralized finance space. For high-potential crypto investors under $5, Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are a very strong triumvirate. XRP provides institutional liquidity and regulatory drivers, DOGE is based on grassroots popularity-fueled hype, and MUTM provides true DeFi innovation with a guaranteed CertiK audit and 95/100 trust score. With more than $17.75 million raised and tokens as cheap as $0.035 selling in Phase 6, Mutuum Finance offers investors an affordable entry into a secure, growth-oriented ecosystem ahead of its next presale boom. With 2026’s bull cycle imminent, these three tokens are poised to offer the kind of 10x return investors are seeking, with MUTM positioned to drive the charge for early-stage appreciation and ranked among the best cryptos to buy now for 2025.

But every single sale must now be settled in Chinese yuan, not in U.S. dollars or any other foreign currency, according to Reuters, citing two people familiar with the situation. The change comes after Beijing banned all chip exports on October 4, following the Dutch government’s takeover of Nexperia on September 30. The Dutch moved to remove Zhang Xuezheng, the company’s Chinese CEO, and took direct control of operations, citing concerns that Wingtech Technology, Nexperia’s parent in China, could siphon sensitive technology. The Dutch government claims the trigger was corporate governance issues, but U.S. pressure played a huge role, seeing as Wingtech had already landed on a restricted export list in Washington. China factory halts exports, resumes domestic trade in yuan Nexperia’s Chinese unit, which halted all shipments after the October 4 order, has now resumed supplying chips only inside China, but under strict new conditions. Distributors are being told they must settle all purchases in yuan, and are not allowed to use U.S. dollars, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. Even more, distributors have been instructed to only use yuan in downstream sales to their own customers. One of the people said the move is aimed at keeping supply inside China stable while breaking away from the Dutch parent’s control. Nexperia , which still produces its chips in the Netherlands, relies on China to package a large portion of them before distribution. But that packaging partnership may soon shift. Nexperia is now looking for other packaging firms outside China, after tensions with its own Chinese arm escalated. While the company says this plan had been in place before the dispute, people briefed on internal strategy say the search for new partners has picked up urgency. At the same time, Nexperia has warned Chinese customers that it doesn’t guarantee the quality of products sourced from its China subsidiary. According to the second person familiar with the matter, that warning was sent out quietly. A Nexperia spokesperson didn’t deny this, only stating that the company “had to inform customers of potential risks,” but stopped short of telling them to avoid buying from the Chinese unit altogether. Beijing backlash intensifies rift with Dutch parent The Chinese unit is clearly pissed. It didn’t respond directly to Reuters but later posted a public message on WeChat claiming it is “operating independently” and that manufacturing and business activities remain normal. It also accused the Dutch parent of spreading “groundless doubt” about product compliance and said it would be pursuing legal options. The suspension of exports has already shaken automakers.The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said its members were told by a Dutch chipmaker that it can’t guarantee steady deliveries, a major red flag for Japanese auto part suppliers. That could spill into production timelines globally, especially since Nexperia makes high-volume, basic chips used in nearly every vehicle. Meanwhile, the German economy ministry said it’s setting up urgent calls with automakers and suppliers to address fallout from the Nexperia situation. The Dutch economy minister has also spoken with his Chinese counterpart but admitted no resolution was reached.

TON historic price sentiment TON price by CoinGecko Ton network launched in 2018 as the Telegram Open Network (TON) but was later renamed “The Open Network” and taken over by the TON Foundation. In June 2020, all Toncoin tokens (98.55% of the total supply) became available for mining. The tokens were placed in special Giver smart contracts, enabling anyone to mine until 28 June 2022. Users mined around 200,000 TON daily. All the tokens were mined in two years, marking the completion of the distribution event. On September 20, 2021, TON registered its all-time low price at $0.3906. Its first significant break came in November 2021. In days, the coin slid from $0.8 to $4.5. It corrected in 2022, reaching a low of $0.9. In 2023, it ranged between $1.1 and $2.5. In 2024, it registered another bull run, rising from $2.11 to its all-time high of $8.24 on Jun 15, 2024.

The team behind Bunni said they do not have enough money to safely restart the project. Bunni Closes Over Lack of Funds Bunni announced on September 2, 2025, that it had fallen victim to a hack that resulted in the loss of approximately $8.4 million. The attackers exploited a vulnerability in the DEX’s smart contracts related to its Liquidity Distribution Function. This allowed them to manipulate internal calculations and drain funds from liquidity pools on Ethereum. While initial reports indicated that between $2.3 million and $2.4 million had been stolen on Ethereum, analysis by QuillAudits and Halborn revealed a further $5.9 million was lost on Unichain. The stolen assets included USDC and USDT, which were consolidated into a single wallet. After the incident, Bunni paused all smart contract activity and advised users to withdraw their funds. The project later revealed via X that restarting the platform would require between six and seven figures in audit and monitoring costs. However, they said they could not afford these expenses, which led them to decide to stop operations. “It is with saddened hearts that we announce the shutdown of Bunni,” wrote the team. The platform’s users will still be able to withdraw their assets through the official website until further notice. The project also plans to distribute the remaining treasury funds to holders of BUNNI, LIT, and veBUNNI tokens, based on a snapshot that will exclude team members. Additionally, the Bunni v2 smart contracts have been relicensed from BUSL to MIT, making features like surge fees and autonomous rebalancing freely available to its ecosystem. Efforts to recover the stolen money are ongoing in collaboration with law enforcement. They closed the statement by thanking the community for its continued support throughout their journey. Back-to-Back DeFi Shutdowns Bunni is the second DeFi initiative to close in less than 48 hours. The Kadena organization also recently announced the cessation of all its business and development activities due to unfavorable market conditions. According to the official statement, the Kadena blockchain will continue to run independently, maintained by decentralized miners and developers. Meanwhile, its native token, KDA, and protocol infrastructure will remain operational without disruption. Members of the X crypto community were quick to respond to the latest developments. One user questioned what was happening to the industry, noting how projects were quitting one after the other. In the aftermath of the announcement, KDA’s price dropped by more than 99% from its 2021 peak of $27.64, with analysts claiming its chart showed signs of dumping days before the team informed the public of the closure.

Although the deadlines for decisions on numerous ETFs pending before the SEC have arrived, the SEC is unable to announce its decisions due to the shutdown. However, despite this delay, new ETF applications continue to arrive. At this point, one of the most established companies in the US, T. Rowe Price, has filed a new cryptocurrency ETF application with the SEC. This was no ordinary application; it marked a significant milestone, symbolizing the company's direct entry into the cryptocurrency market. While the company is active in the ETF market, it was its first ETF application in the cryptocurrency space. The established company, founded in 1937, is seeking regulatory approval from the SEC to launch an actively managed ETF tied to multiple cryptocurrencies. The ETF will offer investors the opportunity to invest in 5 to 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This list currently ranges from Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP to Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). At this point, the $1.8 trillion asset management firm's first foray into the cryptocurrency world comes nearly two years after the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, said in a post on X: “T. Rowe Price has filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an actively managed cryptocurrency ETF. This application is a significant move that completely exceeds market expectations.” *This is not investment advice.

Max Glass sued RWA through the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that RWA’s controlling members, Gregory DiPrisco and Joseph Quintilian, orchestrated a “fiduciary betrayal” to force him out and assume ownership of the company’s stablecoin business without his involvement or consent. According to Glass, the two executives “coerced him into signing away his rights” before launching a separate venture that later became M0, in violation of their contractual duties to him and the firm. Former executive he was ‘deceived’ out of RWA Company In his legal complaint, Glass accuses DiPrisco and Quintilian of engaging in “a scheme of coercion, fraudulent inducement, and subsequent breaches of fiduciary duty,” claiming that they deliberately misled him to gain control of the company’s intellectual property and partnerships. He propounded that the pair diverted RWA’s planned stablecoin project, developed in collaboration with German fintech startup CrossLend GmbH, into a new entity that eventually became M0. M0 is not a stablecoin issuer like Tether or Circle on its own, but provides the infrastructure that has created several multi-million-dollar stablecoin projects, including MetaMask’s mUSD. “The M0 enterprise was built upon the RWA Co.-CrossLend relationship,” Glass stated in the filing, also claiming he was wrongfully cut out from the upside of the project that came directly from his work at the RWA company. CrossLend is a Berlin-based fintech company that digitizes and standardizes loan and mortgage data. Although it is not a crypto-native firm, Glass insists RWA’s collaboration with CrossLend was meant to create a stablecoin product backed by tokenized real-world assets. However, he alleges that his former partners used this partnership to quietly build a new company under a different name that excluded him from the venture’s ownership and future profits. Glass’s attorneys believe there was a “pattern of concealment” from the defendants for several years, during which he says the defendants concealed the relationship between RWA, CrossLend, and M0. He is seeking unspecified damages, restitution, and recognition of his ownership interests tied to RWA’s original stablecoin project. M0 fundraising in August M0 is one of the more prominent players in the digital payments industry since it became a distributed platform helping institutions issue customized stablecoins using its underlying protocol. Much different from centralized issuers such as Circle’s USDC, which never realized its plan for taking service providers under its Centre Consortium, M0’s allows several entities to issue their own stablecoins under a shared standard. Each issuer can “wrap” the base M0 coin with proprietary features for differentiation and customization. In just one year since launch, M0 has facilitated the creation of four active stablecoins with a combined issuance of $325 million. The company closed a $40 million Series B funding round in late August, led by Polychain Capital, Ribbit Capital, and Endeavor Catalyst. M0 fundraisers hit a total of $100 million with the input of Wintermute Ventures, ParaFi Capital, HackVC, Galaxy, Anthony Scaramucci’s SALT, and Bain Capital. CEO Luca Prosperi said the platform presents a “greater autonomy” for fintech builders who prefer using the US dollar in digital form. “We want to empower the builders of great fintech products to actually control the digital dollar stack they use. The current stablecoin technology isn’t fit for that purpose,” he asserted. The stablecoin market is now valued at around $308 billion and could surpass $1 trillion in market capitalization by the end of the decade, according to industry projections. However, Europe’s top financial watchdog ESRB (European Systemic Risk Board), is asking regulators to “tightly” enforce the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The ESRB’s report published last month revealed stablecoins Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC are collectively backed by approximately $129 billion in bonds. It believes that under stress conditions, mass redemptions could kickstart a “bank run” scenario, where issuers would be forced to liquidate their reserves, and this could destabilize bond markets.

The company says rising orders from clients like Tesla and Apple are driving the growth. CEO Jean-Marc Chery said the focus is on “accelerating innovation” and “reshaping our manufacturing footprint.” The projection still falls short of analyst expectations. According to a poll by LSEG, Wall Street was looking for $3.34 billion in Q4 sales and $3.12 billion in Q3. Even so, STMicro is showing some signs of recovery in markets that have been wrecked since COVID: consumer electronics, auto, and industrial chips. STMicro reduces 2025 capex while continuing chip supply for Apple and Tesla While Texas Instruments on Wednesday spooked the market with a gloomy Q4 outlook, STMicro took a different tone, though it’s not throwing money around either. The company quietly slashed its 2025 capital expenditure plan to “slightly below $2 billion,” down from its previous range of $2 to $2.3 billion. It blamed “current market conditions” but didn’t give much detail beyond that. STMicro also gave a nod to its cost-cutting program, saying it “remains on schedule” even after some pushback in Italy. The plan has faced labor resistance in the country, but it seems STMicro is pushing forward regardless. Meanwhile, the firm’s clients are preparing for big chip transitions of their own. Apple is expected to roll out its first 2-nanometer chip, the A20, inside next year’s iPhone 18. This would replace the current 3-nanometer chips Apple uses, which are based on TSMC’s older node. The A20 will also be the base for the new M6 series chips used in Macs. TSMC has already warned partners, including Apple, that the price for this new chip won’t be cheap. Costs are expected to jump by at least 50% compared to the 3-nanometer units. High upfront spending on the new manufacturing node and low yields are part of the reason. Suppliers expect the chip could cost around $280 per unit, which would make it the most expensive component inside the iPhone. Apple will either eat that margin or pass the cost to buyers. Over at Tesla, Cryptopolitan reported that CEO Elon Musk’s custom AI chip, called AI5, will be manufactured by both Samsung in Texas and TSMC in Arizona. “Our explicit goal is to have an oversupply of AI5 chips,” Elon told investors. “Any chips not used in cars or robots can be used in our data centers.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|Apple|STMicro|STMicroelectronics|Tesla|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-23 07:55:09

US Senators Question Witkoff’s Crypto Holdings On Wednesday, eight Senate Democrats, led by Senator Adam Schiff, questioned the US Special Envoy for peace missions, Steve Witkoff, about his digital asset ownership and his links to the Trump Family crypto ventures. In a letter shared by Fortune, the US lawmakers raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest as Witkoff’s latest financial disclosure showed that he has yet to divest from some of his crypto holdings, including an ownership stake in World Liberty Financial (WLF) and the company’s WLFI token. Notably, the US Special Envoy is one of WLFI’s co-founders alongside his son, Zach Witkoff, and members of the Trump Family. “As long as you maintain ownership of these assets, you stand to profit from any decisions you are involved with while serving in the Administration. Moreover, the public has ample reason to be concerned that your decision-making may also be influenced by your close personal and business ties to the Trump Organization,” the letter read. The Senators noted that one of WLF’s co-founders, Zak Folkman, previously affirmed that by May 23, 2025, Witkoff had “no operational role, no financial interest in WLFI deals, and no influence on day-to-day decisions.” Folkman also added that Witkoff was “in the process of fully divesting from WLFI,” which had not happened at the time of the release of White House financial report in August. To the lawmakers, this underscores the “troubling entanglement” between the US Special Envoy’s official duties and his private financial interest tied to the Trump family businesses, highlighting World Liberty Financial’s $2 billion deal with a United Arab Emirates (UAE) firm involving the company’s stablecoin USD1. As reported by Bitcoinist, previous Wall Street Journal (WSJ) coverage raised similar concerns regarding the “extraordinary blurring of government negotiations and private business dealings,” claiming that it is “rewriting the diplomatic playbook for some foreign countries looking to gain traction with the new Trump administration.” In May, the WSJ claimed that father-and-son duo Steve and Zach Witkoff have potentially helped blur the lines of private business and public duties of the current administration, highlighting World Liberty Financial’s deal to enable MGX’s $2 billion investment. The report also noted a previous article that claimed the elder Witkoff was allegedly involved in the talks between the Trump family and Binance. Nonetheless, these talks have been denied by Binance’s co-founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao. Ethical Compliance Inquiries Mount “Your failure to divest your ownership in these assets raises serious questions about your compliance with federal ethics laws and, more importantly, ability to serve the American people over your own financial interests,” the lawmakers stated. In the letter, the Senate Democrats asked Witkoff to respond to multiple requests by October 31, 2025. Among the questions, they inquired about the status of his financial interest in the Trump-linked crypto company. Additionally, they asked the US special Envoy if he had received a written waiver that exempts him from penalties and allows him to participate in key discussions with the UAE while owning a stake in WLFI. If a waiver has not been granted, they also requested an explanation of how Witkoff’s financial holdings do not violate federal ethics laws and regulations, which prohibit government officials from participating in ventures that could benefit them or their relatives. It’s worth noting that Witkoff is one of multiple US officials who have been questioned about their own holdings or the US President’s crypto ventures. In July, Senate Democrats pressed the new head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) about a potential conflict of interest related to the Trump family’s stablecoin, USD1. Earlier this year, two senators raised similar concerns in a letter to former acting chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mark Uyeda. Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers proposed the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act to prevent crypto-related conflicts of interest four months ago. A recent investigation highlighted that, unlike most of his predecessors, President Trump has not put his crypto ventures in a trust managed by an independent party.

Since its official launch on October 15, the campaign has attracted over 50,000 participants and generated more than 10 million global impressions. The campaign spans over 160 countries and regions, underscoring LBank’s expanding international footprint and community reach. The anniversary carnival features three main event tracks: The Claw Machine Lucky Draw, Trade Like a Champion, and Bonus Pro. Users can participate by completing deposit, trading, or referral tasks to earn rewards, including BTC, ETH, SOL, popular meme tokens, and iPhone 17 Pro devices. Official statistics show that on the first day alone, participation exceeded 50,000 entries, while community engagement and trading frequency surged to new highs. https://x.com/LBank_Exchange/status/1978415684922044665 Fueled by this buzz, LBank's platform activity has skyrocketed. The website recorded over 13 million visits, reflecting a 20% quarter-over-quarter increase in web traffic. According to CoinMarketCap, LBank’s average daily trading volume has surpassed $10.5 billion; Messari estimates its global market share at around 3.1%. Meanwhile, CoinGecko data indicates that in the third quarter, LBank’s futures trading volume rose 92.3% quarter-over-quarter, the fastest growth among leading global exchanges. Industry analysts note that LBank’s tenth-anniversary momentum reflects a broader shift in exchange competition, from short-term traffic acquisition to long-term structural strength. The campaign’s performance, they suggest, stems less from marketing expenditure and more from the exchange’s sustained emphasis on system stability, risk management, and community operations. As the celebration continues, LBank plans to launch additional community challenges, trading competitions, and global offline events in the coming weeks to further expand participation and engagement. Industry observers see the campaign as both a celebration of the platform’s decade-long growth and a signal of its next phase — one defined by measured progress and sustainable expansion within the global exchange landscape.

Rowe Price Seeks Approval For Crypto ETF Linked To Multiple Tokens,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/1-7-trillion-firm-t-rowe-price-seeks-approval-for-crypto-etf-linked-to-multiple-tokens/,"According to a Reuters report, global asset management firm T. Rowe Price, with $1.7 trillion in assets under management (AuM), is seeking regulatory approval to launch its first actively managed crypto ETF linked to multiple tokens, marking the firm’s initial entry into the cryptocurrency market space. The Firm’s First Crypto ETF Bryan Armour, an exchange-traded fund analyst at Morningstar, commented on the development stating, “It’s a surprise to see them as a relatively late entrant, but they’re planning to offer something differentiated to try and break into the space.” Related Reading: Crypto Winter Looms: These Key Signals Point To A Deeper Crash Ahead While many asset managers have inundated the SEC with applications for ETFs tied to individual cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), among the most anticipated, proposals for new multi-coin products that are actively managed remain uncommon, Armour added. T. Row Price’s crypto ETF reportedly aims to provide investors exposure to a selection of five to 15 digital coins that meet specific eligibility criteria. The fund’s prospectus indicates that eligible assets could include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), SOL, DOGE, and Shiba Inu (SHIB). The managers will target outperformance of the FTSE Crypto US Listed Index, utilizing fundamental, valuation, and momentum factors to guide their asset selections and portfolio allocations, a spokesman told Reuters. T. Rowe Price’s New Digital Assets Strategy Rowe Price has been closely monitoring developments in the digital assets space and has developed the capability to trade digital assets in recent years, Reuters highlighted. In 2022, as one of its first steps to prepare for entering the industry, the firm appointed Blue Macellari, a former crypto hedge fund executive, as head of its digital assets strategy. This could be boosted by recent regulatory developments in the US, where the pro-crypto Trump administration has developed and introduced new crypto bills that aim to lay the foundation for transforming the country into the crypto capital of the world, as Donald Trump himself has stated repeatedly this year. Related Reading: Gold Rotation Impact: Bitwise Warns Bitcoin Could Skyrocket To $242,000 Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, an ETF market analysis firm, commented, “It’s exciting to see them expand their ETF lineup beyond stock and bond exposure.” Numerous crypto ETF applications are awaiting SEC approval amid a government shutdown that has significantly reduced the agency’s operational capacity. These products are unlikely to receive the green light until the shutdown concludes, despite the regulator’s recent adoption of new listing standards that have paved the way for a range of new offerings, including the T. Rowe Price crypto ETF. As of this writing, Bitcoin has resumed its downward trend, dropping to the lower boundary of its consolidation range at $107,988—a 3.5% decrease from Tuesday’s valuation.

While institutions weigh inflation data and market liquidity, retail traders are turning their focus toward coins showing early signs of strength. Ethereum ETFs Stir Fresh Optimism Ethereum is finding its rhythm again. Despite ETF outflows of $145 million this week, ETH climbed 0.5% to around $3,973, a steady recovery after a rough month. Analysts say the coming U.S. inflation report could trigger the next market shift — especially if inflation cools. Institutional investors are also watching SharpLink , which expanded its Ethereum holdings to 859,853 ETH worth $3.5 billion. This move signals growing belief in Ethereum’s long-term strength as a treasury asset. SharpLink’s 450% stock rise over six months adds fuel to the bullish case. With the Ethereum ETF conversation heating up , investors are preparing for a stronger ETH rebound, which often lifts the rest of the market. Many now list Ethereum as a must-watch in the coming weeks among the best altcoins to buy for a massive rebound . Solana Eyes a Sharp Recovery Solana (SOL) continues to attract both retail and institutional interest after briefly dipping below $180. Traders view this as a buy-the-dip setup, with many targeting $250 as the next milestone. Analysts such as John Bollinger have pointed out a potential “W” reversal pattern forming, a structure often linked with price recoveries. This technical setup, alongside recent ETF inflows of $156 million into Solana-based products, has boosted confidence in the altcoin’s ability to regain traction. Institutional demand remains strong. SOL products recorded nearly $3 billion in inflows this year, indicating that buyers are positioning early for a rebound. If ETF approvals go through, Solana could lead the next market-wide move , earning its place among the top altcoins to buy for a massive rebound . Cardano Analyst Predicts 333% Rally Analyst Javon Marks believes Cardano (ADA) is setting up for a massive upswing. Despite its current price of $0.63, Marks predicts ADA could surge to $2.96 , marking a 333% rally . He explained that Cardano has held a consistent uptrend since breaking out of its long-term descending trendline. The pattern of higher highs and higher lows remains intact, signaling that its structure is still healthy. Other market watchers, such as Chris O , forecast even higher levels, between $5 and $8 , once the next cycle accelerates. With the Ethereum ETF hype spreading through the market, ADA remains firmly on the radar for anyone seeking the best altcoins to buy for a massive rebound . Chainlink Gains Institutional Interest Chainlink (LINK) is drawing renewed attention as large investors and institutions circle back to the project. Despite a short-term dip to $17.52, Grayscale and Bitwise have both filed for Chainlink ETFs , potentially opening the door for regulated exposure to the asset. This move could bring in a new wave of demand, similar to what happened with Bitcoin ETF approvals. At the same time, whale wallets have accumulated over 54 million LINK around $16, tightening supply and creating a strong support zone. With Chainlink leading real-world asset integration through partnerships with SWIFT, ICE, and S&P Global , its utility case remains clear. As institutional activity grows, LINK stands out among the best altcoins to buy for a massive rebound in this cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Safe Haven Altcoin on the Rise Amid the ETF buzz and market corrections, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn attention as another altcoin to pay serious attention to now . Analysts list it among the top altcoins to buy before the next bullish phase , with its price climbing every hour — no dips, just steady growth. Over 21,000 investors have already joined in, and word is spreading fast about its upcoming CEX listing . As supply tightens, scarcity is setting in, driving more FOMO among early entrants looking for hedge and diversification options. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE: Price climbs hourly with zero dips Safe haven during broader market declines Upcoming CEX listing fueling demand Growing investor base building scarcity Final Thoughts Market sentiment is turning as ETF news reshapes the landscape. Traders looking for the best altcoins to buy for a massive rebound are watching Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Chainlink , and MAGACOIN FINANCE closely. As prices begin to recover, visiting the MAGACOIN FINANCE website early could be the move that sets traders ahead before the next bullish phase kicks in.

Key Takeaways: Bunni DEX is shutting down after a $8.4 million exploit drained funds across Ethereum and Unichain. The team cited a lack of capital to cover relaunch and security costs, halting all future development. Bunni’s v2 smart contracts have been open-sourced under the MIT License, allowing developers to reuse its technology in new DeFi projects. In an X post on Thursday, the Bunni team said it could not continue operating due to a shortage of funds needed to rebuild and secure the platform. “The recent exploit has forced Bunni’s growth to a halt, and in order to securely relaunch we’d need to pay 6-7 figures in audit & monitoring expenses alone – requiring capital that we simply don’t have,” the team wrote . Bunni Exploit Drains $8.4M Across Ethereum and Unichain The exploit, which took place on September 2, drained $8.4 million across Ethereum and layer-2 network Unichain, prompting an immediate halt to operations. A subsequent blog post on September 4 confirmed that attackers had taken advantage of vulnerabilities within the protocol’s codebase. Built on Uniswap v4, Bunni aimed to optimize returns for liquidity providers through a custom system known as the Liquidity Distribution Function. Before the exploit, the protocol had seen explosive growth. Its total value locked (TVL) jumped from $2.23 million in June to nearly $80 million by mid-August, according to DeFiLlama. While Bunni will no longer operate, the team has open-sourced its Bunni v2 smart contracts, relicensing them from Business Source License (BSL) to the MIT License. The move allows developers to freely integrate Bunni’s innovations, including liquidity distribution functions, surge fees, and autonomous rebalancing, into new DeFi projects. The decision drew praise from parts of the community for preserving the project’s technical contributions. Hello everyone, it is with saddened hearts that we announce the shutdown of Bunni. The recent exploit has forced Bunni's growth to a halt, and in order to securely relaunch we'd need to pay 6-7 figures in audit & monitoring expenses alone – requiring capital that we simply don't… — Bunni (@bunni_xyz) October 23, 2025 Users will still be able to withdraw assets through the Bunni website until further notice, and remaining treasury assets will be distributed to BUNNI, LIT, and veBUNNI tokenholders once legal approvals are secured. Team members will not receive any portion of these funds. The team added that it continues to cooperate with law enforcement to recover the stolen funds. Kadena Announces Shutdown Amid “Difficult Market Conditions” Bunni’s closure follows the recent shutdown of Kadena’s founding team , which also cited “difficult market conditions.” Despite the exit, Kadena’s network remains operational, though its native token KDA has dropped over 70% since the announcement, currently trading near $0.06, per CoinGecko. Kadena’s mainnet went live in January 2020, promising to combine Bitcoin-style security with high throughput through an architecture known as “braided chains.” At its peak in 2021, Kadena’s token reached a market capitalization of nearly $4 billion, supported by a growing community and a $100 million grant program for Web3 developers. But the network struggled to attract sustained adoption. According to data from DeFiLlama , Kadena’s total value locked in DeFi has plunged to just $128,000, down 71% in 24 hours and a far cry from its all-time high of $11 million in August 2022.

X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull), a prominent crypto analyst, recently highlighted these surging metrics, noting that RWA volume has risen by 84%, and stablecoin volume is up 83% in just 30 days. He added that the spike followed the GTreasury and Evernorth $1 billion XRP treasury announcements, pointing to a sharp rise in institutional engagement. The total value of RWAs now stands at $365.39 million, an increase of 4.34%, and the RWA holder count has reached 2,025. The platform currently supports 22 real-world assets and five stablecoins, with the stablecoin market cap now totaling $282.79 million, representing nearly 6% increase from the previous month.

Do the math pic.twitter.com/4jUcmAHv4w — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) October 21, 2025 A Surge Linked to Institutional Activity The sharp increase in activity comes shortly after high-profile treasury-related announcements. The timing aligns closely with the growing use of tokenized treasury instruments on the XRPL. The data dashboard shows leading contributors to tokenized value, including the OpenEden TBILL Vault at $83.86 million, VERT’s 94th CRA tranches totaling more than $90 million combined, and offerings from Montis Group Limited and Ondo’s Short-Term U.S. Government Bond Fund. These assets reflect a trend of traditional financial instruments being issued and traded natively on-chain through the XRPL. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Expanding Institutional Confidence The XRPL’s rise in both RWA and stablecoin activity indicates expanding confidence among institutional users . The platform’s design for high-speed, low-cost settlement has long been viewed as suitable for large-scale financial applications. As on-chain treasury and bond instruments gain traction, XRP Ledger’s role as a settlement and tokenization network becomes more central to blockchain-based finance. Potential Upside for XRP X Finance Bull summarized the market outlook by noting that “trillions will flow” and emphasized that with a market cap of just $146 billion, the upside is massive. While such predictions remain speculative, the rapid growth in real-world usage provides a data-backed case for optimism. The GTreasury and Evernorth initiatives mark a shift toward large-scale corporate and institutional adoption of XRP as a core component in digital treasury operations.

As traditional blue chips like Bitcoin and Ethereum consolidate, investors are quietly turning to the next generation of 100x Crypto Coins , where entry prices remain low, upside potential is immense, and early adoption is key. Among these, Blazpay’s $0.0075 presale entry has emerged as one of the most compelling opportunities before listings begin. The current market tone is mixed: Bitcoin struggles to reclaim upside momentum, Ethereum remains in a cautious range, and Solana, XRP, and Sui show sparks of life amid uncertainty. Meanwhile, presales like Blazpay are attracting capital from investors seeking both technological depth and scalable adoption. Analysts argue this next wave of 100x Crypto Coins will be defined by AI integration, user engagement, and cross-chain versatility - all pillars Blazpay is already executing at scale. Unlike speculative hype cycles, Blazpay represents a low-entry, utility-first model that blends Crypto AI with financial inclusivity. It’s a token built for traders, developers, and enterprises who see the next frontier beyond hype - the automation of decentralized finance through AI. 1. Blazpay Is Reshaping the AI Finance Landscape Blazpay’s rise during Phase 2 of its presale has been nothing short of impressive. With over 106 million tokens sold, nearly $745,000 raised, and 67.8% completion, the project is steadily gaining traction among early adopters. The current price of $0.0075 per BLAZ token represents what analysts are calling a “pre-hype” valuation - an early entry point that rarely coincides with such strong ecosystem metrics. At its core, Blazpay offers seamless Multichain interoperability, a gamified rewards system, and an AI-powered SDK - a trio of innovations setting it apart from standard DeFi platforms. The platform has already achieved 800K+ active users, 3M+ transactions, and $200K+ in distributed rewards, marking real-world engagement that’s uncommon for projects still in presale. Blazpay’s strength lies in building a unified layer of AI crypto solutions that bridge blockchain ecosystems. As Crypto AI continues to shape the next investment frontier, Blazpay positions itself as the Best Crypto Coin to buy for those seeking long-term compounding returns. Perpetual Trading Meets Unified AI Finance Blazpay is not just another presale - it’s an integrated crypto-financial ecosystem built around AI automation, perpetual trading tools, and cross-chain liquidity solutions. With its upcoming AI-powered financial assistant, users will be able to interact across major chains like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain without leaving the Blazpay interface. The project’s Conversational AI system enables real-time portfolio insights, trading recommendations, and yield tracking, while gamified rewards incentivize user engagement. These elements transform the user experience, blending convenience with performance - a core reason analysts categorize Blazpay among the Next Big Crypto Coin prospects for 2025. As investor sentiment gradually rotates from saturated markets into early-stage AI-driven ecosystems, Blazpay’s approach to Crypto AI makes it a standout. It’s not merely participating in the AI crypto presale wave - it’s helping define it. How a $2,000 Bet in Blazpay Could Multiply Fast With Phase 2 nearing completion, early participants at the $0.0075 price point stand to benefit the most. A $2,000 investment today could yield over 266,000 BLAZ tokens, which analysts believe could see exponential upside following exchange listings. In a conservative projection, if Blazpay reaches $0.25, that $2,000 becomes $66,500. Under moderate market enthusiasm, with prices climbing to $0.50, returns surpass $130,000. And in an optimistic scenario, assuming broad AI crypto adoption and strong liquidity post-listing, prices near $1.00 could generate $266,000+ - a clear testament to its 100x potential. This asymmetric setup - low entry, high potential - is precisely why traders and investors are calling Blazpay the Best Coin to Invest In before 2026. It captures the same early momentum that defined Solana and Cardano in their pre-parabolic phases but with the added benefit of AI integration and live user traction. Blazpay Price Forecast: Early Presale, Massive Upside Analysts expect Blazpay to surge after listings due to its limited supply, cross-chain utility, and strong presale performance. The price has already risen from $0.0075 to $0.009375, showing early demand. Experts see three possible paths ahead: $0.25 (conservative), $0.50 (moderate), or $1.00+ (optimistic) by late 2025, depending on adoption and scaling. With its AI-powered, seamless crypto solutions, Blazpay fits perfectly into the 2025 trend of innovation and financial accessibility. How to Buy Blazpay Before the Next Price Jump Visit the official Blazpay website. Connect your crypto wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Select your preferred network (ETH, BSC, or SOL). Enter the amount of BLAZ tokens you wish to purchase. Confirm the transaction before Phase 2 ends. Act before the price increases from $0.0075 to $0.009375 to lock in the lowest possible entry and maximize your potential upside. 2. Bitcoin: The Foundation Faces a Turning Point While Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of crypto value, its recent performance reflects macroeconomic headwinds. The October correction has prompted debates among analysts - is this a short-term reset or the start of a broader revaluation? Despite short-term turbulence, Bitcoin’s long-term digital gold narrative endures, keeping it among the Best Crypto Coins to Buy for conservative portfolios. The focus for now lies on market structure recovery and institutional accumulation. For aggressive investors, however, the real excitement is in projects offering better risk-reward profiles - the 100x Crypto Coins leading innovation over legacy. 3. Ethereum: DeFi Titan Balancing Growth and Consolidation Ethereum continues to dominate as the smart contract leader. The chain’s deep integration into decentralized finance and tokenized ecosystems ensures sustained relevance. However, as gas fees and network congestion persist, the market is watching how AI crypto presale projects like Blazpay approach scalability and user experience differently. For investors, Ethereum remains a Best Coin to Invest In, but it may no longer deliver exponential returns relative to smaller, agile projects redefining DeFi infrastructure. 4. Solana: Developers and Traders Reignite Momentum Solana’s ecosystem has rebounded strongly, supported by developer activity and rising decentralized app engagement. The network’s combination of speed, scalability, and cost efficiency makes it one of the Best Crypto Coins to Buy heading into 2026. Still, with Solana’s valuation already high, investors seeking 100x Crypto Coins are looking to early-phase entrants like Blazpay for asymmetric upside - especially those integrating Crypto AI utility layers. 5. XRP: Momentum Returns as Legal Clouds Clear XRP continues to surprise analysts with its resilience. The market’s renewed optimism stems from progress in regulatory clarity and expansion of its cross-border payment infrastructure. As confidence builds, XRP reclaims its role as a liquidity-focused asset within the top market cap tier. However, while XRP’s strength is undeniable, its growth curve remains more measured compared to AI crypto presale tokens like Blazpay that blend innovation with scalability. 6. Sui: Emerging Star in Scalable Networks Sui’s rapid rise has placed it among the new contenders for network efficiency and transaction scalability. Its momentum within Crypto AI circles reflects developer enthusiasm for high-speed infrastructure capable of hosting AI-driven financial protocols - a niche Blazpay also targets. 7. Polkadot: Cross-Chain Vision Strengthened by Upgrades Polkadot’s network upgrades and ecosystem enhancements have revived investor attention. Its elastic scaling and runtime upgrades position it as a long-term interoperability leader, though returns remain moderate compared to rising 100x Crypto Coins like Blazpay . 8. Cardano: Resilience Through Research and Adoption Cardano continues to build patiently, focusing on security and academic-driven innovation. Its community strength and active development keep it in discussions of the Best Crypto Coins to Buy, though investors seeking faster returns are pivoting to AI crypto presales. 9. Avalanche: Enterprise Growth and Network Efficiency Avalanche’s focus on enterprise-grade applications and improved consensus mechanisms makes it a vital player in scalable DeFi ecosystems. Yet, while its technology matures, retail attention is turning to Next Big Crypto Coin stories where early entry offers 100x upside potential. 10. TRON: Network Powerhouse With Stable Traction TRON’s ecosystem thrives on entertainment and utility applications, sustaining strong user activity. Although it remains a blockchain mainstay, its price momentum is comparatively muted. For traders eyeing high-velocity growth, Crypto AI entrants like Blazpay offer more exponential upside. AI-Powered Crypto Revolution: Why Blazpay Leads the Next Wave The ongoing shift toward AI-integrated financial systems will likely define the next market cycle. With early traction, real-world utility, and an accessible presale entry, Blazpay is not just another token - it’s the Next Big Crypto Coin positioned to lead the AI crypto presale revolution. For those scanning the horizon for the next breakout trend, the message is clear: while Bitcoin and Ethereum hold legacy status, Blazpay is where innovation and opportunity meet. In a market poised for transformation, 100x Crypto Coins like Blazpay represent the future of decentralized finance.

However, the spotlight remains on Blazpay, which is rapidly emerging as the Top Crypto Presale of 2025. Currently in Phase 2, the Blazpay presale is priced at $0.0075 per BLAZ token, with 71.2% sold and over $786,200 raised. With the next price increase set to $0.009375, investors are racing to secure early positions before the final phase. While BNB and Chainlink maintain market dominance, Blazpay is drawing attention as the Best Crypto Coin to buy, thanks to its AI-driven ecosystem, multichain SDK, and gamified rewards that combine innovation with accessibility and an edge over high-priced tokens in mature stages. Blazpay Ignites October: The Unified DeFi Revolution Blazpay’s meteoric rise in 2025 comes from its core mission of building a unified, intelligent DeFi experience. The project combines Conversational AI, Perpetual Trading, and Unified Services, creating a connected financial hub where users can trade, earn, and interact across multiple blockchains. At just $0.0075, Blazpay stands out among the Top AI Crypto Coins for offering exceptional entry value. Its user base has already surpassed 800,000+ users, with 3 million+ transactions and over $200,000 in rewards distributed, showcasing real community traction. For early investors, this blend of AI and DeFi innovation marks Blazpay as the Top Crypto Presale and a potential breakout contender heading into 2026. Smart Trading Power: How Blazpay’s Perpetual Trading Redefines DeFi Blazpay’s Perpetual Trading module allows users to execute trades with the precision of centralized exchanges but within a decentralized, AI-optimized environment. With real-time analytics, liquidity routing, and risk management tools, traders gain the speed and control needed to outperform volatile markets. This system is supported by Blazpay’s Unified Services layer, which integrates wallets, staking, and rewards into one seamless platform. Combined, these innovations make Blazpay more than just a presale; it's a next-generation financial engine, further cementing its status as the Top Crypto Presale in October 2025. From $2,000 to $60,000+: The Blazpay Growth Scenario At the current presale rate of $0.0075, a $2,000 investment secures around 266,000 BLAZ tokens. If Blazpay hits just $0.075 (10x) post-listing, that’s a $20,000 return.A move to $0.15 (20x) equals $40,000, and reaching $0.225 (30x) could grow the investment to over $60,000. This exponential potential places Blazpay ahead of larger assets like BNB or Chainlink, where prices have already matured, making it the Best Crypto Coin to buy for those seeking asymmetric upside during the 2025 bull cycle. Price Prediction: Analysts Target $0.05–$0.15 Range for Blazpay Market analysts project Blazpay’s post-listing range between $0.05 and $0.15 within its first trading cycle. The token’s low supply, AI-powered utilities, and multichain support drive strong fundamentals for continued growth. As adoption of its SDK and DeFi integrations expands, Blazpay could easily enter the Top AI Crypto Coins list in 2026, solidifying its long-term value among presale giants. BNB Holds Firm at $1,070 Amid Expanding Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB) remains one of the most stable assets in the crypto market, currently trading near $1,070 with a market capitalization of $156 billion. As the native token of the Binance ecosystem, BNB offers users transaction fee discounts, launchpad access, and participation in Binance Smart Chain (BSC) governance. While minor short-term corrections have occurred, BNB’s strong user base and BSC adoption provide lasting support. Analysts expect BNB to trade between $1,000 and $1,150, with potential upside driven by upcoming Binance product innovations and institutional partnerships. Chainlink ($LINK) Gains Momentum Near $18 Amid Network Expansion Chainlink (LINK) is trading around $18.02 with a market cap of $12.2B, regaining momentum as its decentralized oracle network expands. LINK remains vital for feeding real-world data to DeFi, insurance, and gaming smart contracts, securing its place among the Top AI Crypto Coins. The network recently added new partnerships and upgrades, boosting security and cross-chain interoperability. With 678M circulating LINK of a 1B total supply, demand is fueled by both institutional adoption and ecosystem growth. Analysts note support near $16.8–$17.0, with potential upside toward $20. Strategic initiatives like the Chainlink Reserve and high-profile advisors, including Eric Schmidt, reinforce LINK’s long-term role as a trusted blockchain infrastructure token. Blazpay, BNB, and Chainlink: Three Pillars of 2025’s Crypto Growth Comparing Blazpay, BNB, and Chainlink, each represents a unique market strength: BNB delivers scalability and ecosystem dominance through Binance. Chainlink powers smart contract connectivity across blockchains. Blazpay merges AI automation, multichain SDKs, and DeFi gamification, representing innovation and early-stage potential. While BNB and LINK drive established networks, Blazpay captures the spirit of 2025’s next-generation growth as an accessible, intelligent presale opportunity leading the Top Crypto Presale market.

Bitcoin is currently trading down 14% from its all-time high and has failed to recover from the record leverage flush earlier this month. With leverage now at the 61st percentile and prices near one-year lows relative to gold, this appears to be a mid-cycle correction rather than the start of a bear market, the analysts noted. No Bear Market Yet Global M2 growth explains over half of Bitcoin’s price variance, reinforcing its role as an anti-money printing asset. According to MacroMicro, global M2 supply has grown by 6.8% since the beginning of the year as central banks continue to print money. The report identified two factors in addition to M2 supply that influence Bitcoin’s price and market movements: global liquidity, leverage, and on-chain activity. Nearly 73% of Bitcoin’s price variance since October 2020 has been explained by changes in futures open interest, while there are strong correlations between blockchain revenues and token prices, which demonstrate real adoption. The investment manager said it wasn’t willing to bet against Bitcoin with fiat debasement accelerating in recent years. “With Bitcoin comprising ~2% of global money supply, we believe digital assets can play an increasingly important role in investment portfolios; arguably, owning less than ~2% Bitcoin or other digital assets is implicitly expressing a short position on the asset class.” Caution: Volatility Ahead The sentiment has been echoed by several analysts recently who opined that the bull market is not over yet. However, there is still a lot of volatility ahead, said investor Ted Pillows. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expects lower inflation next month, which means this week’s CPI report could disappoint, he added. “High inflation usually pressures crypto, since it raises expectations for tighter monetary policy. If CPI comes in lower than expected, crypto could bounce.” MN Fund founder Michaël van de Poppe echoed the sentiment, stating, “markets continue to fumble until the next big macroeconomic event comes in: CPI.” “That’s going to provide a direction for the markets of Bitcoin, and also what we could expect from the Fed.” The delayed CPI report for September is scheduled for release on Friday.

Broader sentiment has been cautious, with many altcoins still trading below their earlier 2025 highs. However, renewed discussions around blockchain adoption and Ripple’s continued efforts to expand the use of XRP in payments have kept the asset in focus. Against this backdrop, we asked ChatGPT to provide a forward-looking projection for XRP’s price on November 1, 2025, taking into account historical patterns, technical indicators, and fundamental drivers. ChatGPT’s Analytical Approach The AI provided a detailed analysis and forecast, offering a range that hints at moderate growth over the next few days. According to ChatGPT, XRP’s price could reach as high as $5, depending on market conditions and broader macroeconomic factors. The AI based this on three key areas: historical performance, current market structure, and adoption progress. In its assessment, ChatGPT noted that XRP historically trails Bitcoin in each major bull cycle. It described the market’s current phase as one where “Bitcoin is wrapping up its post-halving expansion phase, with altcoins like XRP preparing to run next.” With XRP trading at $2.4, ChatGPT suggests it could experience rapid growth in the final days of October. Historical and Technical Observations Looking at XRP’s historical performance, ChatGPT observed that “in 2017 and 2021, XRP’s post-consolidation breakout averaged 8x to 15x from its base once momentum returned.” While it did not suggest such extreme gains would repeat, this pattern informed its projection that further appreciation was possible during the ongoing cycle. From a technical standpoint, the AI highlighted that XRP has already “doubled from its 2024 lows and broken a multi-year descending trendline .” Such developments typically indicate renewed momentum, suggesting XRP could continue to advance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 On a fundamental level, ChatGPT referenced Ripple’s growing integrations with financial platforms, including the recent $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury , and its support for the newly-formed crypto-asset firm Evernorth, which will build an institutional treasury of XRP and enhance the token’s utility and institutional appeal. Projected Price Scenarios for XRP Based on these combined factors, ChatGPT outlined three specific scenarios for November 1, 2025: Bullish scenario: XRP could reach between $4.2 and $5, assuming a peak in altcoin activity and strong liquidity inflows supported by positive adoption headlines. Base case: A moderate rise toward $3 to $3.5, reflecting steady growth and some market consolidation. Bearish case: A retracement to $1.8 to $2.2, if market conditions weaken or institutional traction slows. After weighing these conditions, ChatGPT provided a single best estimate, projecting XRP’s value at approximately $3.2 on November 1.

The Second Amended Class Action Complaint alleges Chow and associates operated the Meteora-Kelsier Enterprise as a “ fraud factory ” disguised as decentralized finance, using the Meteora liquidity-pooling protocol on Solana as the core engine for multi-token pump-and-dump operations across $M3M3 , $LIBRA , $MELANIA , $ENRON , and $TRUST . Plaintiffs Omar Hurlock, Anuj Mehta, and John Winslow claim that defendants exploited technical settings, like whitelists and freeze/thaw toggles, to acquire a majority of the token supplies at negligible cost before manufacturing artificial price spikes through undisclosed paid influencers. Forensic analysis identified a central coordinating wallet, prefixed 0xcEA, that repeatedly funded deployer wallets, creating tokens, seeding initial liquidity, and financing sniper wallets that captured early supply. Source: Court Listener The lawsuit seeks disgorgement of all profits, trebling of compensatory damages under RICO statutes, and appointment of a qualified independent receiver over Meteora’s upgradeable smart-contract programs. Six-Step Fraud Playbook Exploited Celebrity Endorsements The complaint details a systematic playbook used across all tokens. It begins with narrative invention using borrowed fame, then rigging supply through insider-funded accounts that execute opening-second orders, manufacturing hype through undisclosed paid Key Opinion Leaders, and engineering price spikes using Meteora’s pool controls to pause public trading until insider positions are secured. It also involves executing extraction by selling massive positions while draining liquidity, and reinventing the scheme with new themes but recycled tooling. The $LIBRA fraud exemplified this pattern when Argentine President Javier Milei’s verified social media account posted the contract address at the exact moment pools opened in February 2025, triggering a retail stampede. The campaign styled $LIBRA as a patriotic Argentine revival initiative promising to fund small businesses. Within hours of launch, the deployer wallet withdrew over $110 million in USDC stablecoin liquidity, stripping the token of its foundation and causing instant price collapse, coinciding with Milei’s post-retraction. A group of Argentine #crypto investors have launched a lawsuit against Javier Milei, an outspoken MP and bitcoin advocate who wants to run for president. Read more https://t.co/MplcXKW6rI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 23, 2022 The $MELANIA fraud marketed the token as the official meme coin of Melania Trump, with claimed vesting mechanisms to protect against dumping. Wallets connected to the Meteora-Kelsier cluster accumulated approximately one-third of the entire supply in minutes before the official launch. After orchestrated hype, insider wallets dumped tokens into the surge, with the price subsequently losing over 90% of market capitalization within days. Kelsier Ventures CEO Hayden Davis, who co-founded both $LIBRA and $MELANIA, stated in a YouTube interview that “ we sniped our own coin to prevent snipers from sniping our own coin. “ Chow Resigned in February, Now Faces RICO Charges Back in February 2025, Ben Chow stepped down from Meteora following the $LIBRA controversy , with Jupiter co-founder Meow stating that, while confident in Chow’s character, he showed “ a lack of judgment and care about some of the core aspects of the project. ” A leaked video posted by SolanaFloor showed DeFiTuna founder Dhirk informing Chow about Davis’s misconduct, with Chow expressing visible shock and stating, “ I feel so sick, because I gave him Melania. I fucked up because I enabled the guy that should not have been enabled. “ The lawsuit alleges that Chow maintained unique expertise in controlling technology, directing the configuration of liquidity pools, fee routing, trading parameters, and the ability to freeze or thaw trading selectively. Kelsier Labs secretly agreed to invest approximately $2 million into Meteora’s operations as a pay-to-play buy-in. Source: Court Listener Whistleblower communications confirm Hayden Davis acted under Chow’s instructions on more than fifteen token launches, establishing central command. The complaint asserts seven causes of action, including fraud, conspiracy to defraud, RICO violations for a pattern of racketeering activity consisting of thousands of wire fraud acts, deceptive practices under New York General Business Law, and unjust enrichment. The timing coincides with broader scrutiny of Trump family crypto ventures, which reportedly generated $1 billion in pre-tax gains over the past year . The $TRUMP and $MELANIA coins generated approximately $427 million, while both tokens experienced dramatic declines during the presidential inauguration, with $MELANIA’s market cap plummeting from $2 billion to $790 million.

It is the second crypto project to fold in the same week blockchain firm Kadena declared bankruptcy and ceased business operations. According to a brief statement written on X post Thursday, the Bunni team confirmed it would be closing down due to a lack of funds, struggling with the extensive financial and technical burden required to rebuild after losing funds to hackers. “In order to securely relaunch we’d need to pay six to seven figures in audit and monitoring expenses alone, capital that we simply don’t have. It’d also take months of development and business development effort just to get Bunni back to where it was before the exploit, which we cannot afford. Thus, we have decided it’s best to shut down Bunni,” the team wrote . Bunni permanently closes its doors after September exploit Ethereum-based decentralized exchange BunniXYZ suffered the exploit in September after one of its smart contracts was compromised, Cryptopolitan reported . According to blockchain data, the attacker targeted stablecoin vaults holding USDT and USDC, before funneling roughly $2.3 million worth of assets through several decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Blockchain investigators found that the hacker moved the stolen tokens by converting parts of the loot into ETH and other stablecoins. The BunniXYZ team closed all active smart contracts to prevent further losses after detecting the breach, but the exploiter was still swapping funds through DeFi protocols in the hours that followed. Bunni mentioned that users would still be able to withdraw their assets via the project’s website “until further notice.” The team also stated plans to distribute treasury assets to holders of BUNNI, LIT, and veBUNNI tokens based on a blockchain snapshot. “The validation of the legal process is ongoing, and the exact details of the distribution will be shared at a later date once the legal process is finalized. Team members will be excluded from the snapshot,” Bunni asserted. Developers also announced that the Bunni v2 smart contracts have been relicensed from Business Source License (BUSL) to the more permissive MIT license. This change will allow the broader DeFi community to reuse its technologies, including Liquidity-Directed Fees (LDFs), surge fees, and autonomous rebalancing mechanisms. “We have pushed the AMM [automated market maker] space forward by a generation, and it would be a shame if our efforts went to waste,” the team stated. Bunni promised to continue cooperating with law enforcement in efforts to recover the stolen assets. “Thank you to everyone who has supported us throughout our journey to push DeFi forward,” the post concluded. The decision to shut down prompted a response from security auditing and Sequoia Capital-backed firm FailSafe, which offered to assist Bunni to keep its operations going. Kadena’s closure preceded Bunni’s Bunni’s shutdown came just over a day after blockchain infrastructure company Kadena revealed it was ceasing operations due to bankruptcy. In a statement posted on Tuesday, Kadena said it was “no longer able to continue business operations” and would immediately halt all activities and maintenance of its blockchain platform. The company told users the closure was a result of deteriorating market conditions, adding that it had notified its employees and would retain a small team to oversee the transition and wind-down process. “The Kadena blockchain is not owned or operated by the company. As a thoroughly decentralized proof-of-work smart-contract blockchain, the network is operated by independent miners, while on-chain smart contracts and protocols are governed independently by their maintainers. We will be encouraging all node operators to upgrade as soon as possible,” the team stated. Kadena reiterated that its native token, KDA, and its protocol will continue to operate post the company’s exit. The blockchain’s tokenomics show more than 566 million KDA still available as mining rewards, which will be distributed through 2139. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

We asked Google’s Gemini AI Assistant what the future holds for the $XRP token, and the response was bullish. Depending on factors, such as the approval of $XRP ETFs, positive news could push the coin’s price to $3 initially, with a new ATH at $4 or beyond also a possibility. The Best Wallet Token is pumping hard and bullish for the coming year. To date, it has raised over $16.6M in its presale. It’s been a tough several weeks for XRP ($XRP), as Ledger’s native token slid sharply after US President Donald Trump’s threat of a fresh round of tariffs on China. From hovering around $3 for most of 2025, it’s currently trading around $2.40. The highly anticipated approvals of $XRP ETFs, however, could give the token a much-needed boost, which could even see it hit a new ATH by next year. With that in mind, we asked Google’s Gemini AI Assistant for an $XRP price prediction to see how it could potentially perform in the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is also getting ready for the future as it aims to grab a huge chunk of the crypto wallet market by 2026. Before that, let’s take a look at Gemini’s AI crystal ball and what the coming weeks and months may have to offer. $XRP to Hit $5 in 2026? Here’s What Gemini Thinks The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has received a number of $XRP ETF applications this year, with key decisions meant to be made this week. However, with the lingering US government shutdown, the applicants have yet to hear from the SEC. This has further added to $XRP’s slide along with the market-wide downturn. According to Gemini, approval of these applications will have a positive impact on $XRP, which could push its price to between $2.50 and $3 in the near term, and as much as $4 by early 2026. In addition to this, institutional investors could further drive the coin’s price. One of these is Japanese firm SBI Holdings, which made a massive $200M investment in Evernorth, a Ripple-backed company that aims to be the largest $XRP corporate treasury. Evernorth alone could have a massive impact on the XRP ecosystem, with plans that include institutional lending and DeFi integration. Put together, XRP ETFs, institutional adoption, and expansion of XRP’s capabilities could make it possible for $XRP to push past $3 and even set a new ATH. Best Wallet Token: Ready for Increased Crypto Adoption in 2026. It’s not only $XRP that already has its eyes trained on 2026. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is also working hard to make its crypto wallet a dominant market force as we usher in the new year. 👉🏼 For a detailed guide on $BEST, take a look at our Best Wallet Token review.

West Texas Intermediate rallied to almost $60 per barrel, and Brent gained 3% to trade above $64 as gold descended toward $4,000 an ounce after losing 0.5% on Thursday. President Trump intensified pressure on his counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for lacking commitment to peace in Ukraine. He also threatened stiffer tariffs on India, a key buyer of Russian oil, warning the country to stop buying oil from Russia or suffer the consequences. Senior refinery executives in India stated that the flow of Russian crude oil will gradually decrease to near-zero, noting that the restrictions make it impossible for the flow to continue as usual. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement that his office is sanctioning Russia’s two oil giants that fund the Kremlin’s war machine, given Putin’s refusal to end the senseless invasion of Ukraine. He added that the U.S. encourages its allies to join and adhere to the sanctions. However, Trump said he hopes the sanctions on Russia will not last despite acknowledging that his talks with Putin do not seem to go anywhere. Meanwhile, Trump’s aggressive attempts to reshape global trade and heightened geopolitical uncertainty have also led to a decline in gold prices. Spot gold fell 2.9% on Wednesday after it tumbled nearly 6.3% on Tuesday. The retreat abruptly stopped the gold rally that had been ongoing since mid-August. However, Darwei Kung, Head of Commodities and Portfolio Manager at DWS Group, said the pullback does not change his long-term bullish view on gold. Ziemba says the U.S. has taken meaningful measures Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at the Center for New American Security in Washington, said the sanctions on Russia’s crude are one of the meaningful measures the U.S. has taken. However, she believes the extensive use of illicit financial networks will likely blunt this move. Ziemba claims it will eventually come down to whether India and China fear further escalation in secondary sanctions. The two countries became the biggest buyers of Russian oil after other nations shunned Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. However, Trump imposed crushing tariffs on India for continuing the trade, but has spared China from any action. Meanwhile, the UK sanctioned two Chinese energy firms last week and penalized Rosneft and Lukoil. “The market will take time to digest exactly what this means … It’s likely to be a major cause of concern for the refiners in India and China.” – Vandana Hari , Founder of Vanda Insights. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Trump stated that India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him that the country would reduce its purchases of Russian crude oil. Previous U.S. measures included a Group of Seven price cap on Russian oil, which limited the Kremlin’s revenue without disrupting global supply or causing spikes in global oil prices. Day claims the drivers of gold have not changed Despite the slump in gold prices, Adrian Day, owner of the namesake asset management firm in Maryland, said gold prices will find a floor within a few days because the drivers of gold have not changed. He added that the Fed will not raise rates and the government will not address the budget deficit because there are no fundamental factors to change what people think or say about gold in a meaningful way. Citigroup’s strategist, Charlie Massy-Collier, said gold prices had run ahead of the debasement narrative, adding that gold’s bullishness is bound to return. However, given the current price levels, he claimed there is no rush to position for that comeback. Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s macro strategist Ven Ram believes the slump in gold prices was just an accident waiting to happen. The decline also came as investors weighed potential progress in trade talks between the U.S. and China. The recent resurgence of tension also appears to increase demand for the haven asset.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has rapidly captured the spotlight as a top crypto to buy in 2025. Currently priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, already over 70% sold out, Mutuum Finance has raised more than $17.75 million, signaling strong investor confidence in its long-term vision. What makes this new crypto coin stand out is its groundbreaking dual-lending protocol, which merges Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending models. This hybrid design allows users to lend, borrow, and earn yields seamlessly within one ecosystem, dramatically improving capital efficiency compared to traditional DeFi platforms. With the Sepolia Testnet launch of its Lending and Borrowing protocol scheduled for Q4 2025, featuring liquidity pools, mtTokens, and ETH/USDT collateralization, Mutuum Finance is shaping up as a serious Ethereum successor. For investors seeking the next-generation DeFi powerhouse, MUTM offers both innovation and early-entry potential, a combination that could define the next major crypto breakout. Ethereum (ETH) Supply Squeeze Could Herald a Possible Major Breakout in the Near Term Ethereum (ETH) is likely to experience its next major move since on-chain metrics suggest that there might be a possible supply squeeze in place. Exchange reserve levels have fallen to an all-time record low of 2025 at approximately $60.8 billion, which implies that whales are actively accumulating and usable supply keeps declining. This contraction liquidity, with near $19 billion open interest and favorable funding rates, means that market participants are slowly turning bullish again. ETH is now around $3,800-$4,000, a pivotal level which will decide whether the next move is going to be a break to the upside in a fiery manner or another round of consolidation. Several analysts are drawing parallels with late 2020, a time of low-profile build-up ahead of Ethereum’s huge rally to all-time highs. As Ethereum gains momentum, smart money investors are also eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the project that may gain from fresh money inflow into decentralized finance in Ethereum’s next bullish cycle. Mutuum Finance’s Accelerating Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming one of the cryptos to watch out for in 2025. Its presale has been incredible, with it already raising $17.75 million in 6 Phases from over 17,370 investors. Phase 6 is well over 70% sold out. Its runaway speed has generated huge investor demand, cementing Mutuum Finance as the top crypto to buy at the moment and a new crypto coin catching serious attention in the DeFi ecosystem. With the presale price now at $0.035, investors are getting MUTM at its lowest point of entry prior to the next cost increase. On Phase 7 commencement, the token will grow by 14.28%, creating a distinct motive for early entry as Mutuum Finance positions itself for its next most significant growth phase. Investors searching for the top crypto to buy this cycle and a new crypto coin with early upside potential are finding MUTM especially appealing as it sits at the core of DeFi growth and real-world usability. Daily Leaderboard Hypes Community Mutuum Finance’s leaderboard challenge continues flooding its community with profitable daily bonuses. Over the last 24 hours, the day’s top buyers made purchases worth $510, $472, $470, $396 and $208 in MUTM tokens, reflecting growing activity and rising investor interest. The top buyer of the day makes a $500 MUTM reward, an accessible motivation from completing at least one purchase in a 24-hour period, a feature creating both participation and euphoria around the presale. The Next Crypto to Explode Ethereum’s constricting supply and institutional confidence are setting the stage for another DeFi bull cycle. As capital flows to up-and-coming innovation, however, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast emerging as a new crypto coin leading the way and a top crypto to buy for long-term investors. At a mere $0.035 and already having broken through above $17.75 million from over 17,340 investors, MUTM’s swift presale traction demonstrates increasing confidence in its double-lending protocol and upcoming Sepolia Testnet (V1) release. Healthy investor synergy, community engagement via the day leaderboard rewards, and open-roadmap transparency place Mutuum Finance in the premier altcoins anyone can find. For anyone evaluating what the top crypto to buy is right now or which new crypto coin offers the strongest mix of utility and early growth, Mutuum Finance stands out as a dominant choice. Investors seeking early access to a project developed with scalability, actual DeFi usability, and next-gen growth need to get into the Mutuum Finance presale today before Phase 6 ends and prices move even higher.

A total of 9.5 BTC were claimed in small denominations. A total of nine Casascius coins were opened today, after years of holding. The coins, worth 5 BTC, 1 BTC and 0.5 BTC, released a total of 9.5 BTC and presumably all related hard forks coins including BCH. The coins were opened a few months after one user claimed a 100 BTC gold Casascius coin, inadvertently releasing the private key before claiming the BCH forked coins. The coins were opened within the span of a few hours, suggesting they may belong to one person. The wallets receiving 0.5 BTC also has a history of splitting 100 BTC into multiple addresses. All of the current wallets that received the newly opened funds from their small-scale coins previously connected to a single address, which distributed 100 BTC in April 2013. It is possible the original 100-BTC wallet opened a gold bar or coin with 100 BTC, then distributed it to additional wallets. The newly opened coins may be part of the same person’s reserves. The opening of several coins follows a recent claim for a one-BTC coin on October 1. Casascius coin openings are now relatively rare, as the holders also retain them for their unopened premium value or as collectible items. In 2025, a total of 432 coins were redeemed, holding 1,100 BTC. The estimated amount in still-active coins is around 38,000 BTC. Less than half of Casascius coins are opened Casascius coins are a novelty, and most seem to drive a strong holding ethos. For now, fewer than 50% of the coins have been opened. There are three still unopened 1,000 BTC coins, one 500 BTC coin and another 35 100-BTC gold bars. Additionally, there are hundreds of still-active coins with smaller denominations, including the most numerous 1-BTC coins. Of those, 12,943 are still active. In total, over 17K coins and bars are active, with around 10K opened. The unclaimed amount of BTC is now valued at over $4B. Casascius coin owner reawakens as BTC stages a recovery The physical coins funded with BTC were activated just as the market was attempting another recovery. BTC traded at $109,670, despite recent selling pressure. In the past months, older whales have taken profits from BTC . Casascius coin owners have tried to secure their coins into new addresses, or seek ways to cash out. Some of the bars were acquired as early as 2011, when BTC was just gaining popularity.

The company, in partnership with Kalshi, is testing the new product in beta as part of a wider effort to diversify its DeFi offerings. The feature allows users to place bets on real-world outcomes, beginning with the Mexico Grand Prix, marking Jupiter’s first step into the growing prediction market sector. The move comes as institutional demand for event-based trading surges, positioning Jupiter to capture fresh liquidity and strengthen its ecosystem within Solana’s expanding network. Jupiter’s Prediction Market Targets Rapid Expansion Jupiter’s Chief Operating Officer, Kash Dhanda, said prediction markets represent a significant step in expanding the range of assets available on-chain. He explained that the product aims to enhance user experience, attract more participants, and create new synergies across Jupiter’s existing services. Dhanda confirmed that the company will continue developing the platform based on user data, noting that community feedback will guide how quickly they scale trading limits and introduce new events. Currently, users can hold up to 1,000 contracts, while global participation is capped at 100,000 contracts during the beta phase. The Mexico Grand Prix market has already surpassed $100,000 in trading volume, with Max Verstappen leading 46% of predictions, followed by Lando Norris at 27%. Jupiter plans to expand to sports, politics, and global affairs once stability is confirmed, aiming for a complete rollout by Q4 2025. Growth in Users and Institutional Momentum According to Jupiter’s Q3 tokenholder report , the platform recorded 8.4 million active users, up 5% from the previous quarter. Dhanda said this expansion will reinforce long-term value for JUP token holders, adding that every new market strengthens the company’s cross-product integration and revenue growth. The project enters a booming sector, with Kalshi recently raising $300 million in a Series D round led by Sequoia Capital, Paradigm, and Coinbase Ventures, pushing its valuation to $5 billion. Meanwhile, Polymarket drew a $2 billion investment from Intercontinental Exchange, reaching a $9 billion valuation. Data from Dune Analytics shows the industry’s weekly trading volume hit $2.03 billion in mid-October, signaling rising institutional appetite for such platforms. Solana Price Strengthens as Momentum Builds As Jupiter expands, Solana (SOL) is showing positive signs. The token trades near $188 , rebounding from support around $180. Analyst Trader Tardigrade observed that SOL’s four-hour chart indicates a bullish MACD crossover, suggesting renewed momentum.

The new business week began more positively, with BTC surging to $111,000 on Monday. After a correction to under $108,000, the asset went on the offensive hard on Tuesday and skyrocketed to $114,000 within hours. However, that turned out to be a fakeout, and BTC lost all the momentum almost immediately. Moreover, it dumped to $106,200 (on Bitstamp) on Wednesday. It has reacted well to this correction and even tapped $110,000 earlier today. Although it has failed at reclaiming that level, it now stands above $109,000.

In an October 22 post on X, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad called the asset the world’s “first truly scarce money,” highlighting its limited supply. He further added that the scarcity will only intensify as the remaining unmined supply dwindles. “Bitcoin is first truly scarce money… Only 21 million ever to be mined. World close 20 million now. Buying will accelerate. FOMO real. Please do not be late. Take care,” Kiyosaki wrote. Why I am buying Bitcoin. Bitcoin is first truly scarce money… only 21 million ever to be mined.

In a new social media post , the author criticized sensational headlines predicting both Bitcoin’s collapse and potential meteoric rise. “I now see “click bait” titles screaming “gold, silver, Bitcoin crashing” or Butcoin to $2 million this month. Then the podcaster then says “To support my channel click and subscribe.” Give me a break,” he added. CLICK BAIT???

However, he also stressed that Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) are likewise the “real money” today. Bitcoin still weak Clickbait or not, Bitcoin keeps facing weakness this week.

Hyperliquid Strategy, a strategic stockbroker for HYPE, has filed an S-1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise up to $1 billion.

FILES S-1 WITH THE SEC TO RAISE $1B THROUGH 160M SHARES.PART OF THE FUNDS FOR POTENTIAL $HYPE TOKEN PURCHASES. 8:22 am · 23 Oct 2025 108 Reply Copy link Read 20 replies Hyperliquid Strategies, a newly formed digital asset treasury company, is raising $1 billion for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE. The company is being created through a merger between Nasdaq-listed biotech firm Sonnet BioTherapeutics and special purpose acquisition firm Rorschach I LLC. Once completed, the entity will operate as a crypto-focused treasury firm centered on the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Such narratives triggered bullish sentiments, as they reflect Hyperliquid Strategies’ confidence in its vision of dominating crypto-native liquidity solutions and on-chain treasury management. The potential $1 billion in new equity funding suggests adequate liquidity for the decentralised exchange. The Hyperliquid ecosystem can leverage the capital to accelerate governance programs and network development. HYPE will gain more utility as the DEX expands. BitMex co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted that Hyperliquid would eclipse Binance and become the largest trading platform globally. He said : By the end of this cycle, Hyperliquid will be the largest crypto exchange of any type, and Jeff Yan might become richer than CZ, the founder and former CEO of Binance. The Kind is dead. Long live the King! A recent study by BitCourier shows Hyperliquid is gaining ground, though Binance dominates liquidity with over $40B in daily trading volume. The DEX’s volume ratio to Binance has increased from 8% early this year to 13.6%. The researchers added : This growth shows that traders are increasingly confident in Hyperliquid’s ability to deliver deep, on-chain liquidity comparable to major centralized venues. On the other hand, Binance has seen its share of challenges recently. For example, the cryptocurrency community has criticised the exchange for facilitating the October 10, 2025, crash. Binance reportedly froze key functionalities as the market plunged, magnifying losses for users who failed to exit to limit losses. Now, Hyperliquid Strategies wants to raise $1 billion to accelerate the project’s expansion. If the deal goes through, the publicly listed company might use the funds to improve liquidity pools, introduce innovative financial tools, and enhance the overall Hyperliquid ecosystem. Such developments could solidify HYPE’s status as the leading digital coins for decentralised treasuries.

Stablecoins are now a global macroeconomic force, announces a16z in its new State of Crypto report , shedding light on the sector’s rapid growth and what it means for the broader market. The claim is backed by strong numbers: Over 1% of all US dollars in circulation exist on public blockchains as tokenized stablecoins. Together, they hold more than $150B in US Treasuries, leaving countries like Saudi Arabia and Germany behind to secure the 17th ranking. Although the crypto market is wobbly after $BTC hit a new ATH earlier this month, that hasn’t tainted its long-term picture. The recent turbulence may have managed to knock $BTC off $110K, but stablecoin trends signal that the market’s maturing – and price corrections are part of the deal. For context, the stablecoin market cap has crossed $300B for the first time ever, as the transaction volume jumps 106% in a year to touch $46T. To grasp how staggering that figure is, we just need to compare it with the world’s largest payment networks. Stablecoin volume is now nearly three times Visa’s volume ($16T) and set to overtake ACH Network ($87T), the same a16z report showed. Several Catalysts Have Come Together While stablecoins were limited to crypto nerds in their early days, they’re now seen as one of the most reliable ways to transfer money cross-border. Ease of use is definitely the primary factor behind their wide use. For this, we have advancing blockchain infrastructure to thank, with some networks capable of processing more than 3400 transactions per second. Murky crypto regulations held back stablecoin adoption for a long time, but crypto regulations like the GENIUS Act have changed that in the US. And the shift is visible across the world. For example, the UK is preparing to introduce a stablecoin framework by the end of 2026. Financial giants and fintech companies have also been actively exploring the digital asset market, encouraging others to follow. For crypto investors, the newly published report is a reminder to expand their portfolios. But being mostly pegged to US dollars, the value of stablecoins reflects the growth of the US economy – not the crypto market. So how can one gain exposure to this booming sector? The answer lies in promising crypto infrastructure projects, which reflect the market’s rapid growth. That explains why strategic investors are stocking up on Best Wallet Token for early-bird prices this month, pushing its presale past $16.6M. Why Best Wallet Token Is the Project to Watch Now Unless blockchain infrastructure evolves alongside rising retail and institutional crypto adoption, sustaining growth will be difficult. The market needs secure wallets, exchanges, and networks to bring more crypto users on board. Noncustodial wallets, in particular, are growing more popular than ever. Since holders have complete control over their private keys, they allow true ownership – in line with the market’s original motto of financial freedom without intermediaries. With hundreds of thousands of users and glowing reviews on both App Store and Play Store, Best Wallet has emerged as a top trending noncustodial crypto wallet this year. What’s behind this growing frenzy? The platform is secured with Fireblocks MPC tech, offering advanced security without compromising user experience. Being multichain, the wallet is flexible and allows users to switch assets between top blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, and BNB Chain. 50 more network integrations are on the way. The Best ecosystem is not limited to its crypto storage solution. It also offers features such as cross-chain swaps and presale access that give it a strong edge against market leaders like MetaMask. For example, the platform plans to launch an everyday crypto shopping card in its next phase, as part of its mission to drive retail crypto adoption. As the native crypto of a trending crypto ecosystem in a fertile niche, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) positions itself as a top crypto to buy now . More than a representation of the project, $BEST unlocks various perks and privileges in the ecosystem – like early access to new projects, reduced transaction fees, higher staking rewards, and community governance rights. These utilities could work well to anchor the token’s value and resilience, helping it withstand turbulent markets and maintain steady growth. See the full $BEST roadmap on the official site. What to Know About $BEST and the Ongoing Presale While the Best Wallet app is already up and live with a growing community of users, the $BEST token is currently on presale. The investment opportunity is still fresh, since $BEST has yet to go live on exchanges. Now in the second roadmap phase, the token is available for purchase at just $0.025835 for the next few hours. Our Best Wallet Token price prediction projects the price to reach $0.072 by the end of the year and as high as $0.62 in 2026, considerably above today’s early prices. For detailed presale instructions, see this ‘ How to Buy Best Wallet Token ‘ guide. Once the next presale stage begins, new adopters will have to pay a higher price to secure the token. Additional staking rewards apply, but the rate is dynamic and bound to go down over time (currently at 79% APY). Visit the official Best Wallet Token presale.

This is even as the meme coin sector stirs with fresh momentum in Q4 2025. Shiba Inu has hovered near $0.000013 to $0.000014 after months of slippage. Yet community fervor and Shibarium’s transaction surge keep it afloat. This setup hints at a double from current depths if resistance cracks. Meanwhile, a viral altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , has captured eyes with projections of 43x upside from its presale perch, blending DeFi utility against SHIB’s speculative roots. Investors now weigh this best crypto to buy now amid stabilizing signals. Such dynamics underscore how altcoins like these reshape recovery plays. Early adopters sense the shift, chasing yields beyond hype. Shiba Inu Braces for Key Resistance Break Shiba Inu has stabilized after a prolonged dip, drawing trader focus to the $0.00003 threshold. That level looms as a pivotal barrier, one that could ignite bullish reversal if breached and held. Speculation builds around this mark, promising over 100% gains from today’s lows. Shibarium’s Layer-2 network has fueled optimism lately, processing millions of transactions since mainnet rollout. Developers there push DeFi tools and NFT hubs, easing fees while expanding SHIB’s role beyond memes. Burn efforts have accelerated too, with community members torching tokens to curb supply bloat near 589 trillion. These actions, though incremental, bolster deflationary hopes. Yet hurdles persist; vast circulation demands explosive demand for real lifts. Analysts note retail resurgence and macro lifts as prerequisites. Social spikes on platforms like X often precede SHIB’s sharpest climbs, a pattern that has repeated since 2021’s frenzy. Still, competition erodes its edge. Newer entrants tout refined tokenomics and transparency, siphoning attention from SHIB’s legacy vibe. The Shib Army rallies loyally, but sustaining buzz grows tougher in a crowded field. Traders eye this rebound warily, balancing nostalgia against fresher prospects. Mutuum Finance Presale Hits Stride Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has surged into phase 6 of its 11-phase rollout, with 75% of allocations snapped up swiftly. This DeFi crypto now trades at $0.035 per token, a 250% climb from phase 1’s $0.01 entry. Funds raised have topped $17,750,000 since inception, drawing 17,370 holders into the fold. Phase 6 sells out fast, closing the window on this pricing before phase 7 hikes it 14.3% to $0.04. Launch beckons at $0.06, projecting 420% ROI for current buyers post-deployment. The protocol’s dual lending setup—peer-to-contract pools for stable yields on ETH and USDT, paired with peer-to-peer options for niche assets—drives its appeal as the next big crypto. Depositors earn via mtTokens, redeemable for principal plus interest, while over-collateralization shields against swings. This structure has lured cautious investors seeking utility over volatility. Team members unveiled a dashboard lately, spotlighting the top 50 holders alongside a 24-hour leaderboard. Daily resets at 00:00 UTC keep competition keen; the top spot claims a $500 MUTM bonus after one transaction. Recent leaders posted buys of $510.56, $472.47, and $470.21 in the last cycle. Such mechanics foster steady engagement. A $100,000 giveaway amplifies the buzz. The giveaway splitting prizes among 10 winners at $10,000 MUTM each. Participants submit wallet addresses, tackle quests, and invest at least $50 in the presale to qualify. These steps not only reward loyalty but also expand the holder base organically. Version 1 testing on Sepolia hits Q4 2025 , featuring liquidity pools, debt tokens, and liquidation bots with initial ETH-USDT support. CertiK’s 90/100 audit score underscores this prep, marking MUTM as a defi crypto primed for scale. Rebound Sparks Altcoin Hunt Traders chasing Shiba Inu’s $0.00003 push now pivot toward altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), where 43x upside from $0.035 aligns with DeFi’s rebound arc. This best crypto to buy now offers tangible lending tools, outpacing meme volatility with structured growth. Secure your position in phase 6 before it vanishes; act on this next big crypto before phase 7’s markup.

FalconX Pushes Into Crypto ETFs & ETPs With 21Shares Acquisition As announced in a press release , FalconX has agreed to acquire 21Shares . FalconX is an institutional crypto prime brokerage that provides large clients with deep global liquidity, derivatives, financing, custody, and settlement across digital asset markets. It has facilitated over $2 trillion in trading volume and hosts a global client base of more than 2,000 institutions. Meanwhile, 21Shares is the largest issuer of crypto exchange-traded funds and products (ETFs/ETPs). ETFs/ETPs refer to investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to an underlying asset without directly having to own it. When a trader invests into one of these vehicles, the provider buys and custodies the asset on their behalf. Some investors may be wary of navigating crypto exchanges and wallets, so products like ETFs and ETPs provide for a more regulated means of investment into digital assets, in a mode that’s more familiar. 21Shares has 55 of these products listed currently, across which it manages over $11 billion in assets. With the acquisition, its asset management product development and distribution capabilities will be combined with FalconX’s institutional-grade infrastructure. The press release noted: Together, the two firms will accelerate the creation of tailored investment products that meet growing institutional and retail demand for regulated digital asset exposure. While FalconX is acquiring 21Shares, the latter will continue to operate independently, with Russell Barlow, its current CEO, remaining in charge. Barlow will work closely with FalconX leadership to advance a shared vision for the digital asset ecosystem. “No changes to the construction or investment objectives of the existing 21shares ETPs (Europe) or ETFs (US) are planned,” said the press release. In some other news, the Bitcoin derivatives landscape has been changing recently, as on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has highlighted in an X post . Previously, the Futures market was dominant, but now the Options market is beginning to rival it in terms of Open Interest . The Open Interest here is naturally a measure of the total amount of positions related to the crypto that are currently open on all derivatives exchanges. First, here is a chart that shows the trend in this metric for the Futures market: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Futures Open Interest saw peaks above $20 billion in the 2021 bull market and recently reached a high of about $50 billion. The Options Open Interest couldn’t even break $15 billion in the last cycle, but today its 7-day moving average (MA) value is floating around a new all-time high (ATH) of more than $55 billion. As the analytics firm has explained, Markets are shifting toward defined-risk and volatility strategies, meaning options flows, rather than futures liquidations, are becoming a more influential force in shaping price action. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $107,800, down over 4% in the last 24 hours.",Crypto News|21Shares|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto ETFs|Cryptocurrency|FalconX,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 10:00:47

US President Donald Trump is probably the most pro-crypto president in the world. To name a few crypto initiatives proposed under his admin: the GENIUS and CLARITY acts, the crypto 401k initiative , the national US Bitcoin Reserve, and Trump’s dream to make the US the ‘crypto capital of the world.’ It’s not an exaggeration to call Trump the Crypto President. His Truth Social posts make or break crypto markets, and he’s even launched his own meme coin ($TRUMP). Best of all, much of the current market’s bullish momentum is due to Trump’s pro-crypto agenda. Bitcoin and top altcoins have peaked thanks to his administration. If you’re looking for the latest updates on Trump’s crypto policies before the market prices them, you’ve come to the to right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider knowledge about Trump’s crypto moves. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack!

Trump Crypto Momentum Builds: Fed’s Waller Announces Payment Innovation, Paving the Way for PEPENODE October 23, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Fed Governor Christopher Waller says the Central Government is entering a ‘new era’ with its new prototype. He said that DeFi will no longer be seen with suspicion or scorn and that distributed ledgers and crypto are now ‘woven into the fabric of the payment and financial systems.’ Appointed by Trump during his first term, Waller is one of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and his address marks a sharp pivot from how the Biden administration viewed crypto. Waller also introduced the idea of ‘ Skinny master account ,’ that would limit interest, overdrafts, and balance sizes, enabling innovation without jeopardizing monetary stability. Central Bank’s newer stance could reshape the US crypto landscape with the legitimization of DeFi and stablecoins as part of the financial mainstream. With Central Bank’s new protocol paving way for crypto innovation, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) emerges as a breakthrough presale project that merges gamified-mining with meme culture. The project’s interactive mine-to-earn ecosystem breaks away from the typical hype-driven image around meme coins, rewarding holders for active participation. Learn how to buy $PEPENODE in our guide here . Solana Reclaims 5-Year Bullish Trendline as Trump’s Crypto Policies Make $250 Possible Again October 23 2025 • 10:00 UTC Solana is back on a major 5-year trendline that spells bullish potential, according to an X trader. This pattern has always preceded big rallies, and we could see $SOL rally to $250. Part of this bullish cycle is clearly due to Trump’s pro-crypto policies and the digital asset treasury race that many S&P 500 companies are in. The best thing about $SOL’s current trendline is its resistance to market dumps and unexpected shocks. Back during the 2022 crash and FTX’s collapse, Solana walked out with relatively few scraps while other cryptos went to the dogs. Now, even Citadel’s CEO is sticking a claim in Solana treasury firms , and according to CoinGecko, companies hold over $2.5B in $SOL, spread across three countries. All this institutional attention to $SOL will trickle down to Solana projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) , which is building the cheapest and fastest $SOL trading bot on Telegram. With $5.4M raised in a presale that’s ending in little over 4 days, $SNORT looks very promising with a token price of just $0.1083. See what our $SNORT price prediction has to say about its potential.

With the company now under Ripple’s ownership, its software could serve as a direct entry point for integrating Ripple’s blockchain solutions , including XRP-based payment rails, into established financial systems. Via gaining control of software already deployed across major institutions, Ripple has earned an operational base for linking the XRP Ledger, XRP, RLUSD, and its custody solutions to treasury processes. The integration could allow banks to manage and move liquidity more efficiently through Ripple’s network, potentially increasing transactional use of XRP over time. The acquisition is part of its vision to modernize corporate finance operations. According to company statements, the goal is to streamline how organizations handle global payments and manage liquidity, combining traditional treasury management with blockchain capabilities.

The company plans to raise over $1 billion through a SPAC merger expected to close in 2026. Evernorth aims to hold and deploy XRP in regulated institutional environments, creating structured exposure for corporate and financial clients. Evernorth’s backers reportedly include Ripple, SBI Holdings, Pantera Capital, and several other major firms in the digital asset sector. Evernorth is a key piece of Ripple’s ecosystem expansion, as it could evolve into a central treasury layer supporting XRP’s role in enterprise finance. What’s Next for XRP? These moves strengthen Ripple’s narrative that XRP is transitioning from a speculative token to a functional component in financial infrastructure. The German analyst stated that XRP is no longer “just a coin” and these developments signal Ripple’s intent to integrate deeply with corporate and banking systems. Together, the GTreasury acquisition and Evernorth’s planned treasury operations position Ripple to connect traditional finance with blockchain technology at an institutional level, a shift that could redefine how XRP is utilized in the years ahead.

The firm plans to allocate approximately $6 billion to support more mature companies, nearly doubling its previous growth fund. Additionally, it is seeking $1.5 billion each for AI applications and AI infrastructure-focused funds, as well as over $1 billion for its “American Dynamism” initiative, which targets manufacturing and defense-related start-ups. If the firm hits its $10 billion goal, it will mark the firm’s largest fundraising effort to date, surpassing its previous raises of $7.2 billion in 2024 and $9 billion in early 2022. The new capital will support both new investments and follow-on funding for existing portfolio companies. Andreessen Horowitz has been backing multiple corporations Since its most recent fundraising round, approximately 18 months ago, Andreessen Horowitz has been involved in several large startup financing deals, including investments in OpenAI and the xAI initiative . The firm also counts Databricks, Mistral, and Black Forest Labs among its investments in AI and software. Additionally, it has been backing major tech names like Coinbase and Anduril. Considering AI startups require more capital than most, a significant portion of the new fund will be reserved for providing additional funding to Andreessen Horowitz’s existing portfolio, insiders say. Founded in 2009 and managing $46 billion in committed capital, Andreessen Horowitz has grown to be a politically influential venture capital player, with former executives now serving in key roles in the Trump administration. The company’s former managing partner, Scott Kupor, was tapped to head the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, and Sriram Krishnan, a former partner, now serves as the White House’s top adviser on AI policy. Meanwhile, following its seed round just six months ago, FurtherAI announced $25 million in Series A funding on Wednesday, led by Andreessen Horowitz — one of the largest early-stage investments in insurance AI. The funds will be used to accelerate product development, develop additional integrations, and grow the team of solution experts, according to the company. CEO Aman Gour even stated that the partnership will help the company modernize an industry that’s long relied on outdated systems. He added, “We’re grateful to partner with leaders across the industry as they modernize operations. Joe Schmidt, Partner at a16z , had also praised the insurance company, “FurtherAI is redefining how insurance gets done.” A16z reported on a bullish outlook for crypto On Wednesday, the firm also published its “State of Crypto 2025″ report. The firm’s latest report is broadly optimistic about the prospects of cryptocurrency, highlighting 2025 as a critical year for institutionalization, with significant developments expected in user adoption, technology, and U.S. regulation. Cryptocurrency is now taking “its place in the economy” as an asset class, according to the report, which notes that Bitcoin represents a majority of all market value and stablecoins’ circulation volumes equivalent to those of Visa . Over the last year, stablecoins have facilitated approximately $46 trillion in payments, surpassing PayPal’s payment volume. However, it’s limited when considering privacy, scalability, and adaptability for AI. So far, the Californian firm has already raised more than $7.6 billion across four funds dedicated to cryptocurrency investments. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The company intends to offer up to 160 million shares of its common stock. Chardan Capital Markets has been roped in to serve as the financial advisor for the fundraising. Hyperliquid S-1 Filing Hyperliquid Strategies is a pending merger between Nasdaq-listed Sonnet BioTherapeutics and the special purpose acquisition firm (SPAC) Rorschach I LLC, a transaction first announced in July and expected to close within the year. Following completion of the merger, the entity will trade on Nasdaq under a new ticker symbol. The company’s leadership includes Chairman Bob Diamond, formerly CEO of Barclays, and CEO David Schamis. Announcing the same, Schamis said , “Today we filed an S1. This document is to allow us to issue additional equity into the market following the close of our transaction. We will only be selling equity if and when we believe the market conditions to be favorable. We have no obligations or requirements to issue any additional capital.” According to the filing, proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including the expansion of its treasury holdings of Hyperliquid’s HYPE token. Currently, Hyperliquid holds 12.6 million HYPE tokens alongside $305 million in cash. The company plans to primarily deploy its HYPE tokens through staking initiatives, which are expected to produce ongoing returns. It also plans to explore other decentralized finance activities within the ecosystem, subject to internal evaluations. Hyperliquid Strategies’ latest filing states that the company intends to selectively utilize its HYPE token holdings to generate value for shareholders and strengthen its position in the crypto market. 2025 Milestones Hyperliquid’s ecosystem saw tremendous success this year. It has managed to assert dominance both in token repurchases and blockchain activity. According to CoinGecko, the platform has led token buybacks after allocating over $644.64 million through its Assistance Fund, which is nearly half of all token buyback spending this year. This effort, surpassing the combined buybacks of the next nine largest projects, has led to the repurchase of at least 21.36 million HYPE tokens, which represent roughly 2.1% of total supply. Monthly buybacks averaged $65.50 million and peaked at $110.62 million in August, with an average price of $30.18 per token. On the blockchain side of things, Hyperliquid has surged ahead of traditional networks. Data from CryptoRank shows the network’s fees jumped 1,600% in a year, as it climbed from $2.4 million in October 2024 to $41 million in October 2025. This surge was fueled by the HIP-3 launch, which enabled permissionless perpetuals and strategic fee reductions that drove record trading volumes. On the other hand, Ethereum and Solana experienced significant declines, while Bitcoin’s on-chain fees plummeted 73% during the same period.

Bitcoin Hyper’s presale has reached $24.6M+ and it’s growing fast, following a FOMO-driven surge in investors. But what’s drawing everyone to Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) ? Bitcoin Hyper is the Layer-2 that promises to upgrade the Bitcoin ecosystem to Solana-grade numbers, removing the fee-based priority system, and allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. In turn, this will make the network more scalable, which is likely to bring in more institutional and retail users, and catapult the ecosystem into the mainstream. This would be a much-needed change to a network choked by its performance cap of seven transactions per second (TPS) – the reason why Bitcoin currently ranks a dismal 23rd in terms of blockchain performance. So, how exactly will Hyper change Bitcoin’s biggest pain points? Bitcoin’s Problem and Why TPS Matters The TPS cap is responsible for several problems within the Bitcoin environment, the most obvious one being the long confirmation queues, increasing finality times to hours during high-traffic periods. Naturally, the free market found a workaround in the form of the fee-based priority system. Essentially, since users compete for limited block space, miners started prioritizing larger transactions with higher fees, leaving the smaller and cheaper ones at the bottom. During high-traffic windows, small transactions can take hours to go through, which explains why the network hasn’t yet penetrated the mainstream. According to data from Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum is the largest ecosystem for active developers in 2025. Solana is second and Bitcoin comes third . And it’s not even close, as Ethereum outweighs Bitcoin by a factor of 3:1. Chainspect’s data looks even grimmer, with Solana leading the list and Bitcoin sitting at the 11th spot in terms of crypto dev activity in 2025. The conclusion is obvious: the limited TPS bottlenecks the network, such that Bitcoin transactions take longer and are, therefore, more expensive than they need to be. The Lightning Network was one of the first serious attempts at correcting the problem, focusing primarily on transaction speed, which would’ve inadvertently reduced costs as well. Unfortunately, it failed to achieve its goals. The reasons were multiple, including bugs, routing failures due to insufficient liquidity and channel imbalances, and even security problems. Then there’s the fact that the network’s fees are route-dependent , which often leads to errors like failed payments or, even worse, overpayments. Other Layer-2s failed for reasons of their own. The Liquid Network, for instance, did increase transaction speed, but relied on a more centralized model, which increased risks of censorship. Fractal Bitcoin failed due to requiring miners to devote their hashing power to Fractal instead of Bitcoin, essentially encouraging them to leave the Bitcoin network . SatoshiVM promised massive scalability and improved security, but its Bool Network bridge was managed and upgradeable by a single account, which introduced massive centralization and posed extreme security risks. It was time for something new – and that’s how Bitcoin Hyper came to be. How Bitcoin Hyper Works Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to make Bitcoin faster, cheaper, more scalable, and more performant across the board. To that end, the project will rely on tools like Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and the Canonical Bridge to speed up execution and transaction times – and keep costs low. The SVM will address the same problem Rootstock attempts to: Bitcoin’s lagging smart contract execution. Unlike Rootstock, though, the SVM has already proven its capabilities in the Solana ecosystem, showcasing a TPS in the thousands. The SVM is a direct competitor to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), built specifically for high throughput and increased agility, allowing for the ultra-fast execution of DeFi apps and smart contracts. The Canonical Bridge, on the other hand, will address Bitcoin’s capped TPS by bridging the Hyper and Bitcoin ecosystems. This will allow the Canonical Bridge to mint your Bitcoins directly onto the Hyper layer, as soon as the Bitcoin Relay Program confirms the transaction details. Your wrapped bitcoins will be available for use within the Hyper layer, or until you decide to withdraw them back to Bitcoin’s Layer-1. Together with SVM, the Canonical Bridge eliminates the fee-based priority system, reduces transaction times to seconds, and lowers transaction costs considerably. If implemented successfully, Bitcoin Hyper could transform Bitcoin into an ultra-performant network with near-instant finality and vastly increased scalability. This would catapult the ecosystem at the forefront of the adoption scale and welcome larger institutional investors. Until that happens, though, Hyper first needs to complete its presale – and things are looking good. Should You Invest in Bitcoin Hyper’s Presale? The Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) presale reached $24.6M+ in just a few months after its launch, making it one of the best crypto presales of 2025 . That’s thanks – in part – to a significant amount of whale activity. We’re talking the likes of $379.9K , $274K , and $180.6K whale buys, among many others. That right there shows strong investor interest in this project’s utility-packed proposal. $HYPER is selling at the presale price of $0.013155 right now and comes with a dynamic staking APY of 48%. Our step-by-step guide to buying Bitcoin Hyper can help get you started if you’re thinking of joining the presale. On that note, if you want to invest, now may be the right time, given that the market is preparing for a bullish November. Moreover, $HYPER targets a release window between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026, depending on the ‘prevailing market conditions and demand’. Based on the presale’s momentum, long-term potential, and investor participation, we expect $HYPER to rally once the post-launch cash-in fever has died out. Our price prediction for $HYPER is a potential $1.50 by 2030, which would reward you with an 11,302% ROI if you bought your tokens at today’s price. Bear in mind, though, that presale prices go up in stages, while the staking APY lowers as more holders stake their tokens. And with the next price increase expected by tomorrow, the clock is ticking. Join the $HYPER presale before the next price hike. Disclaimer: This isn’t financial advice.
