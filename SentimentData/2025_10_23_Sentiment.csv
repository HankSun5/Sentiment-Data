Still, the latest dips could be setting the stage for one of the strongest bullish rallies in recent history. In early October, Bitcoin skyrocketed to a record-breaking $126,080, briefly sending capital surging into major altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which had already shattered their previous yearly highs. That momentum didn’t last long. Later that same week, the market slipped sharply after former President Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports. Investor sentiment quickly turned cautious in anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC decision. Nonetheless, several analysts view the correction as a necessary cooldown, clearing out excessive leverage and weaker positions before the next sustained uptrend. Below are three top altcoins to consider based on their upside potential. Ripple (XRP): 2025’s Cross-Border Payment Powerhouse Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , underpins a global payment system known for rapid transactions and ultra-low fees, posing a growing challenge to legacy networks like SWIFT. Backed by the UN Capital Development Fund and partnered with prominent U.S. financial institutions, XRP has risen to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at $143.8 billion. The introduction of Ripple’s dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, underscores the company’s ambition to capture a share of the booming stablecoin sector. Over the past 12 months, XRP has gained 349%, reaching a seven-year high of $3.65 in mid-July, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 62% growth in the same period. With an RSI reading of 39 and a clear divergence from its 30-day moving average, XRP appears poised for renewed upward movement this week. Technical patterns reveal two bullish flags formed over the summer, suggesting potential for continued growth if ETF approvals materialize by mid-October. Should U.S. lawmakers enact comprehensive crypto legislation, XRP could climb even further, possibly landing between $5 and $10. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Prime Rival and This Week’s Market Leader Solana ($SOL) continues to reinforce its reputation as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain platforms. With a market cap hovering above $100 billion and almost $11 billion locked in its DeFi ecosystem, Solana’s network expansion shows no signs of slowing down. Investors are closely watching for potential approval of U.S.-based Solana spot ETFs, which could attract significant institutional inflows similar to those seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. After bottoming out near $100 in April, SOL now trades around $184. Improved regulatory clarity has lifted investor confidence, while technical indicators, an RSI of 40, and a notable deviation from its 30-day moving average, suggest SOL might currently be undervalued. Support remains firm around $150, with major resistance near $250. A clean break above this level could spark another major rally, potentially revisiting its all-time high of $293.31 or even surpassing $500 in a strong bull market. TRON (TRX): Justin Sun’s Blockchain Defies the Downtrend Founded in 2017 by Justin Sun, TRON ($TRX) was designed as a direct competitor to Ethereum. Today, it stands as the second-largest layer one “Ethereum killer” after Solana, boasting a market cap of roughly $30.4 billion compared to Solana’s $100.6 billion. Like Ethereum and Solana, TRON supports sophisticated smart contracts that power a wide range of DeFi applications, from gaming and NFTs to lending and asset tokenization. At present, TRON is the only top-10 cryptocurrency posting gains amid a market-wide decline. While the global crypto market capitalization of $3.74 trillion fell 5% overnight, with Bitcoin dropping 4% and Ethereum and Solana both shedding about 6%. Meanwhile, TRON only fell 1% to $0.3127. Currently, TRON remains 25% below its all-time high of $0.4313, recorded on December 4, 2024. The sharp upward movement on its chart shows a rapid surge of buying activity that drove a 76% increase within 24 hours. TRON may encounter resistance near its prior peak, but a breakout could see prices approach the $0.50 mark. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): 2025’s Breakout Meme Coin Uniting Bitcoin Power and Innovation Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has quickly become one of 2025’s most talked-about presale tokens. The project enhances Bitcoin’s capabilities through a proprietary Layer-2 solution, enabling lightning-fast, low-cost transfers wrapped in a meme coin format. Built for scalability and utility, HYPER introduces decentralized governance via a DAO, advanced smart contracts, and superior transaction speeds, all atop its unique Layer-2 framework. The presale has already raised over $24.5 million, with analysts predicting potential 10x or greater returns post-launch. Developed on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER’s ecosystem includes a seamless Canonical Bridge for Bitcoin transfers, decentralized app compatibility, and built-in meme coin integration. A recent audit by Coinsult confirmed zero security vulnerabilities, further strengthening investor trust. HYPER tokens power key network functions such as staking, governance, and transaction fees, offering early investors staking rewards as high as 48% APY. Bitcoin is going HYPER, don’t miss the start of something big. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

The project recently passed a 16,000 investor milestone , indicating the large level of confidence from both retail and early institutional players. This milestone represents one of the most successful presales for 2025 . It underlines the capacity of the project to attract the trust of a cautious market still recovering from past volatility. Analysts now call MAGACOIN FINANCE a top candidate for 2025’s best crypto presale with the potential for 100x returns post-listing . Investors Rush In Before Prices Move Higher Investor growth has been faster than expected. Each of the presale rounds has closed early, indicating that interest continues to rise. Buyers are rushing to enter early to maximize their entries before the next price tier is activated. This continuous stream of investors demonstrates that their confidence in MAGACOIN FINANCE is not hype, but genuine. The project has been an eye catcher to individuals who prefer structure over bewildering marketing claims. All changes have been transparent, all progress has been visible, and all progress has been steady. That stability has ensured that MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most stable early-stage crypto projects in 2025. Trust Built on Transparency and Security The success of MAGACOIN FINANCE is based on transparency. The entire audit of the project was conducted by HashEx , a reputable blockchain security company that has high standards. The audit has ensured that the MAGACOIN FINANCE contract is fully safe and it has no concealed risks. This confirmation has given both new and old investors confidence that has been shaken by market deceits in the recent past. Its tiered pricing structure also adds to the fairness equation by rewarding early participants and managing token allocation. This way, a healthy ecosystem is developed, and heavy dumping is prevented after listing. Transparency, safety, and fairness have been the perfect case of reliability. MAGACOIN FINANCE is considered a safe and serious project that is not a short-term gamble. Exchange Listings Add to the Excitement The upcoming exchange listings have created more buzz among investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE will be launching on some of the popular trading platforms soon after the end of the presale. Listings often play a major role in price discovery. Analysts expect to see a strong demand from traders who did not have the opportunity to buy the token before it was available on the public market. This next step could draw in another wave of attention as investors see listings as validation. With the foundations already well-built on verified security and an increasing support from the community, the launch of MAGACOIN FINANCE on exchanges could be the start of its recognition in the wider market. As the momentum of the coin grows, there are now many calling it the best crypto to buy early, as returns are expected to increase as the liquidity rises post-launch. Analysts Predict 100x ROI Potential Analysts still believe that early players have a significant advantage. According to them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the combination of timing, credibility, and enthusiasm of investors, three components of most 100x stories. The Patriot50X bonus , providing the buyer with 50% additional tokens included in the project, has served to solidify the enthusiasm. It has propelled fresh investors in the short run and given them the confidence to participate in the long run. The whales are also starting to silently position themselves as well, and the project is viewed as a unique early opportunity where there is safety and growth potential. Final Outlook MAGACOIN FINANCE has acquired 16,000+ investors, has passed a confirmed audit, and has verified future exchange listings. These achievements demonstrate that its emergence is not accidental – it is organized, structured, and community-driven. With transparent updates, clear rewards, and a strong foundation, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as one of the best crypto presales of 2025 . Its stability, ease, and earlier trust place it in an ideal position to serve a market that is willing to trust once more.

The October rally enthusiasm, aka “Uptober”, abruptly ended after President Donald Trump announced sweeping 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, a move that rattled global markets and sparked one of crypto’s sharpest one-day sell-offs in recent memory. With the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC meeting approaching, traders are adopting a cautious stance, waiting for hints of potential monetary easing that could reignite risk appetite. Veteran analysts, however, view the recent pullback as a positive development, emphasizing that steep corrections tend to purge speculative excess and leveraged positions, often laying the groundwork for more durable long-term gains. Binance Coin (BNB): Perplexity AI sees Expanding Dominance Firstly, Binance Coin ($BNB) was originally designed as the exchange’s utility token, but it has evolved into one of the most multifaceted digital assets, driving a growing ecosystem that spans NFTs, decentralized apps, and payment solutions. Source: Perplexity AI BNB’s deflationary design, sustained through Binance’s periodic token burns, continues to support its long-term price resilience by systematically reducing supply over time. Its utility now extends far beyond the Binance platform, with BNB gaining traction among merchants worldwide, from gaming platforms to travel service providers. This widespread adoption has solidified its position among the world’s top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This month, BNB reached a record high of $1,369.99 before pulling back around 21%, following a strong breakout from a bullish pennant formation that developed earlier in the year. Currently showing an RSI of 47, BNB appears to be consolidating between buying and selling pressure. Should bullish momentum return, Perplexity AI believes BNB could push toward the $1,600 mark before the year’s end, while $580–$1,000 may serve as a key support zone in the event of another correction. XRP ($XRP): Claude Predicts a Potential Surge Toward $10 Claude AI’s modeling suggests Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , could see a dramatic upswing, possibly reaching between $5.50 and $6.20 by year-end, more than doubling its current value of about $2.40. Ripple’s landmark victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year ended a five-year legal saga, restoring investor confidence and driving XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 on July 18. Over the past year, XRP has skyrocketed 349%, handily outperforming Bitcoin’s 62% and Ethereum’s 46% gains. Technical analysis shows three distinct bullish flag formations in 2025, two of which emerged during the summer months, often a prelude to major upward moves. Strong seasonal tailwinds in October, potential ETF approvals, favorable regulatory developments, and Ripple’s expanding global partnerships could all help XRP recover recent losses and move closer to the $6 threshold, with $10 being a sober target in a bull-case scenario. Solana (SOL): Claude Forecasts a Break Above $500 Solana ($SOL) continues to reinforce its standing as one of the premier smart contract blockchains, boasting a market cap of more than $100 billion and almost $11 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its DeFi ecosystem. Speculation is heating up that U.S. regulators could approve a spot Solana ETF before the month’s end, a move that could attract substantial institutional capital, echoing the surges seen after Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launches. Solana also stands to benefit from broader industry trends such as the tokenization of real-world assets and the expansion of stablecoin infrastructure, both of which are gaining institutional momentum. Additionally, with transaction speeds and fees outpacing Ethereum’s, Solana remains one of the strongest contenders for mass adoption. After rising to $250 in January and retracing to $100 in April, SOL now trades near $184, suggesting renewed bullish potential. Its low RSI of 40 and proximity below its 30-day moving average indicate the asset may currently be undervalued. Having recently broken out of a bullish flag pattern, Claude projects that Solana could reach between $360 and $500 by year’s end, a rise of up to 70% above its previous all-time high of $293.31. Missed Dogecoin? Meet Maxi Doge (MAXI): The Next-Gen Meme Coin With Degen Energy Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a new entrant in the meme coin arena, has launched its presale phase, already drawing over $3.7 million from investors eager to ride the next viral crypto trend. Branded as Dogecoin’s “high-octane cousin,” Maxi Doge embraces the humor, hype, and community-driven ethos of crypto’s degen culture, focusing on engagement, viral memes, and grassroots participation. Developed as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI offers quicker, more cost-efficient, and eco-friendly transactions compared to traditional meme coins. The project’s marketing strategy centers on Telegram and Discord community events, trading competitions, and influencer collaborations to build early traction. Of its total 150.24 billion token supply, 25% is allocated to a “Maxi Fund” dedicated to marketing, ecosystem growth, and strategic partnerships. Staking is live, with yields reaching up to 82% APY, a figure that gradually decreases as more stakers join. The presale currently values MAXI at $0.000264, with incremental price increases set for each funding milestone. Investors can purchase tokens via MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Experts are now targeting a potential rise toward $200,000, identifying this new all-time high level as Bitcoin’s potential cycle top while suggesting that the cryptocurrency has yet to establish a definitive bottom. Bitcoin Price Explosion To Ignite Biggest Altcoin Season Ever According to digital asset analyst CrediBULL Crypto, Bitcoin’s next parabolic surge could catalyze the biggest altcoin season the market has ever seen. The analyst shared an Elliott Wave chart analysis, showing that BTC is in the early stages of its final fifth wave, a phase that has historically delivered some of the most explosive price rallies in bull markets. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Supercycle Still In Play? Wave 3 Tells A Story Of A Surge Looking at the chart, the first subwave of Wave 5 has already produced a 37% gain, suggesting that the upcoming third and fifth subwaves could be significantly larger, potentially driving Bitcoin well above $150,000 and even toward the $200,000 mark. CrediBULL Crypto argued that such a bullish move will not be grounded in logic or fundamentals but in market psychology, specifically speculation, greed, and euphoria. He revealed that this emotional environment often leads to extreme volatility, which fuels liquidity rotation into alternative cryptocurrencies. Historically, when investors begin redirecting capital away from Bitcoin into altcoins after a BTC top, it typically sparks a full-blown altcoin season. Many smaller-cap assets experience rapid, exponential gains during this time, especially as the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) declines temporarily. CrediBULL Crypto emphasizes that this phase of irrational exuberance is a natural part of the market cycle. When the Bitcoin mania peaks, the resulting FOMO often drives investors to seek higher and faster yields in other assets. The analyst further added that as long as BTC continues to climb, altcoins are likely to follow suit. Analyst Recommends Locking In Ahead Of The Rally In a prior analysis on X social media, CrediBULL Crypto reaffirmed his belief that the current market cycle top has not yet been reached. Despite recent volatility and market crash fueled by the devastating liquidation event on October 10, the analyst maintains that Bitcoin remains structurally bullish on High-Timeframes (HTFs). Related Reading: Expert Says ‘The Time Has Come’, What Could Drive The Next Explosive Altcoin Season He noted that the recent market pullbacks could offer opportunities for traders affected by the liquidation cascade to rebuild positions ahead of the next explosive leg. He stated that even a small allocation, about 10% of their previous holdings, could yield substantial returns if the projected parabolic move unfolds. CrediBULL Crypto has highlighted a critical invalidation level near $74,000, suggesting that as long as the Bitcoin price holds above this zone, its long-term uptrend remains intact. He doubled down on his bullish projection, insisting that the next major rally could propel BTC significantly above $150,000.

Waller at the Payments Innovation Conference on October 21, 2025, Fed staff are examining a new kind of account that would let certain non-bank firms connect directly to the central bank’s payment system. Reports have disclosed the idea is being called a “payment account” or informally a “skinny” master account. What The Federal Reserve Is Proposing The plan would stop short of giving full bank privileges. The accounts would likely not earn interest and would not have access to the Fed’s discount window. Balance caps and other risk limits are expected to be part of the design. Waller said staff are still working through the details and that the concept remains exploratory rather than a finalized rule. Limits And Safeguards Regulators intend to keep guardrails. According to public comments, only “legally eligible” entities would qualify. That phrase leaves open which corporate forms — for example, trust companies, state-chartered firms or other charter types — will be allowed. Fed opens the gates for fintech and crypto access Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller revealed today that the Fed is studying a new model of “payment accounts”. Streamlined accounts that would allow fintech and crypto firms to access the Fed’s payment infrastructure,… https://t.co/QphKaopcRo — StrongSHx (@StrongSHX) October 21, 2025 Reports note the accounts would be smaller in scope than a normal master account, with explicit restrictions aimed at reducing exposure to the payment system. Oversight, AML/KYC checks and operational risk controls are expected to be central to any application process. Why This Matters Now Access to the Fed’s rails has long been limited to banks, which forced many fintech and crypto firms to rely on intermediary banks. Connecting directly, even in a limited way, could reduce steps in settlement and cut certain counterparty risks. There is also context: the Fed withdrew earlier guidance on bank crypto activities this year — on April 24, 2025 — signaling a shift in tone toward integrating new players into payments. Who Stands To Gain Or Lose Crypto firms and stablecoin issuers could find it easier to move funds and settle transactions. Banks that currently provide access to non-banks may face stiffer competition for those services. At the same time, regulators and bank supervisors will still carry the burden of preventing fraud, illicit finance and operational breakdowns. Market participants are likely to watch how the Fed coordinates with the OCC and the FDIC on questions of charters and deposit insurance.

According to the UK’s top banking supervisor, granting UK banks and building societies relief on their £150 billion gilt holdings, as well as their multibillion-pound foreign government bond portfolios, would “risk forgetting one of the main lessons from the 2023 banking failures.” Speaking at the annual Mansion House regulators’ dinner in London on Wednesday, Woods said such a move would be “equivalent to ripping off our jacket, warm hat and gloves and throwing them all over the nearest cliff,” describing it as “profound — and highly risky.” Lessons from 2023 bank failures highlight risks of relaxing leverage ratios Bank lobbyists in Britain and the United States have called on regulators this year to exclude sovereign debt from leverage ratio calculations, which dictate how much capital banks must hold for each dollar of assets. In the UK, it would release around £5 billion of equity capital currently trapped in gilt portfolios at a minimum leverage ratio of 3.25%. Woods, a BoE deputy governor who is set to step down in 2026, noted that the failure of three mid-sized US banks over two years ago — including Silicon Valley Bank — indicated “bonds issued by sound governments, if liquidated in size, can carry major consequences to banks’ balance sheets due to interest rate risk”. SVB’s 2023 collapse, which also affected its UK subsidiary, followed losses on its large US government bond holdings after interest rates rose sharply, sparking a depositor run. Woods added that lifting capital requirements on government debt could “allow a very large increase in bank leverage given the size of banks’ sovereign holdings” and would “largely remove sovereign risk from the bank capital framework” unless banks actively sell the bonds. UK Finance, the main lobbying group for British banks, has previously proposed exempting gilts from leverage ratio calculations as part of its “plan for growth” regulatory reforms. Meanwhile, in June, the US Federal Reserve proposed lowering the leverage ratio for the country’s biggest banks from at least 5% to between 3.5% and 4.25%, aligning more closely with international standards. The Fed did not include a government debt exemption in the proposal. Still, it sought feedback on it as a potential “additional modification,” amid lobbying arguments that it could improve liquidity in US Treasury markets. Financial sector urged to strengthen cybersecurity and risk resilience Speaking at the Mansion House gathering, Nikhil Rathi, CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority, stated that there is growing recognition in the UK of the need to manage cyber risks. He cited the £1.9 billion cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover this year as an illustration of the threats faced by UK businesses. He said that too often, finance had been seen as independent of national security, with insufficient investment in long-term resilience. Rathi also noted that most catastrophe- and cyber-risks in the world remain uninsured, leaving companies, credit ratings, risk premia rates, prices, and ultimately households to bear the burden. Calling on banks and insurers to “step up”, Rathi added: “Let’s all harness the City’s expertise to address the insurance challenges. We will keep shining a light on both the risks and opportunities.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The interest comes just weeks after the New York-based company wrapped up a $300 million funding round that valued it at $5 billion. Venture capital firms are now lining up to pour more cash in, with some discussions floating valuations as high as $12 billion. The people involved in the talks didn’t want to be named because the details are private, but the appetite for this startup is clearly heating up. Earlier this month, Kalshi said its latest round was co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. Back in June, the company raised $185 million at a $2 billion valuation, led by crypto-focused investor Paradigm. Kalshi lets users trade on the outcomes of real-world events, anything from presidential elections and sports games to the duration of a government shutdown. In a recent post on X, co-founder and CEO Tarek Mansour said the company’s annualized trading volume hit $50 billion. Kalshi expands after court win and surging volumes For years, regulators treated prediction markets like a legal grey zone. That changed after Kalshi’s court victory last October, which gave it the right to list presidential election contracts. The ruling ignited a flood of trading on the platform, sending volumes to new highs. Kalshi used its federal license to open markets on sports contests nationwide, expanding what users can legally trade on. This move has boosted its growth and put it in a tighter race with its closest competitor, Polymarket. One person familiar with the company’s latest fundraising reportedly told Bloomberg that the new capital could “strengthen Kalshi’s position in a crowded and fast-moving space.” Both platforms have become magnets for speculators betting on everything from political outcomes to global sports events. Venture capital firms are allegedly competing for early stakes in Kalshi and even making unsolicited, preemptive offers before the company even opens new fundraising rounds. Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has allowed Kalshi to expand its event-based markets, but state gaming regulators, who traditionally oversee sports betting, have been pushing back in court. The CFTC says it still has concerns of market manipulation and insider trading in platforms like this. Wall Street companies and gambling operators are moving fast to partner with prediction exchanges before the industry matures. The National Hockey League this week announced multiyear partnerships with both Kalshi and Polymarket, making it the first major U.S. sports league to embrace these markets directly. At the same time, the industry is seeing an arms race in valuations.Just recently, Cryptopolitan reported that the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns the New York Stock Exchange, would invest up to $2 billion in Polymarket at a valuation of around $8 billion, a massive jump from its $1 billion market cap earlier this year in a Founders Fund-led round.

The automaker said the AI assistant will also tap into the cars’ data to provide alerts, pre-condition the climate inside the cars, and explain driving features. GM said the AI assistant will be preinstalled in both gas and electric cars using the Android Automotive operating system for infotainment. The company is among the first automakers to integrate the Gemini update directly into its cars. Gemini will also become the default voice recognition system, which is expected to possess strong natural language capabilities. However, given the unpredictable nature of generative AI chatbots, GM clarified that it remains to be seen how reliable Gemini will perform on the roads and whether it will consistently make other automatic adjustments, such as climate control. The company stated that its latest upgrade directly competed with Tesla’s xAI Grok and Mercedes’s ChatGPT. Richardson claims GM’s Gemini-powered AI assistant performs better GM’s Vice President of Software and Services, Dave Richardson, said his company’s Gemini-powered AI assistant will perform better than other AI assistants. However, he pointed out that one of the challenges with most AI assistants is that they are frustrating because they do not understand accents very well. They also do not know how to respond appropriately when words are not spoken correctly. Richardson asserted that the most remarkable thing about large language models (LLMs) is that they appear to be unaffected by the above problem. He clarified that such systems have context about previous conversations, which they can retrieve for reference. “They’re flexible in how you speak to them…so overall you’re getting a better, more natural experience.” – Dave Richardson , Vice President of Software and Services at GM The automaker believes that the Gemini-powered AI assistant will make drafting and sending messages, prepping for meetings, or even planning routes with extra stops on the go an enjoyable experience. The assistant will also have internet access, enabling it to crawl the web for answers to specific questions. However, Richardson stressed that drivers will have control over the information accessed or used by the assistant. GM said the new voice assistant is a step towards developing its custom-built AI to connect to cars through GM’s in-car concierge, OnStar. The assistant will be available via Google’s Play Store as an over-the-air upgrade to OnStar-equipped cars produced from 2015 onwards. GM unveils plans for a hands-off, eyes-off driver-assistant system At the GM Forward event, the automaker’s CEO, Mary Barra, announced that her company plans to introduce a new driver-assist system, allowing drivers to take their eyes off the road or be hands-free, starting in 2028. She added that the company was also showcasing other initiatives designed to transform its cars from modes of transportation to intelligent assistants. GM further announced that it is developing a new centralized computing platform, which is expected to start rolling out with the Escalade IQ in 2028. Barra said at the event in lower Manhattan that her company is ready to usher in a new era of mobility. Sterling Anderson, GM’s Chief Product Officer, said the company’s vision is to produce a car that knows and looks out for its driver. Anderson believes centralized computing is a foundational piece of GM’s plans to improve the capabilities of its cars. The automaker also emphasized its plans to upgrade ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems) to feature eyes-off, hands-free driving technology. GM expects to roll out the driving assistance feature in 2028, beginning with the Cadillac Escalade IQ EV. Anderson said this autonomy will make roads safer. Anderson explained that GM’s future cars will utilize lidar (light detection and ranging) systems to enhance their ability to detect their surroundings. He added that the system is expected to reach its full potential through incremental transformations. Get seen where it counts.

With this integration, Bealls becomes the first national retailer to accept digital currencies from any crypto wallet across more than a dozen blockchains at once. The announcement marks Bealls’ 110th anniversary and highlights the company’s ongoing focus on innovation and improving customer experience. Over the years, the retailer has invested in new technologies, such as in-store kiosks and online shopping, and this latest move places it among the early adopters of crypto payments in physical retail. Bealls Makes a Crypto Leap According to the official press release, the system supports a wide range of assets, including stablecoins and meme coins. Customers will be able to make purchases using digital currencies at Bealls, Bealls Florida, and Home Centric stores. As part of the deal, the retailer will utilize Flexa Payments, a digital payment solution designed for speed and versatility. The platform enables merchants to accept over 99 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and stablecoins such as USDC, from more than 300 different wallets. Flexa Payments connects with existing retail systems and operates across mobile, in-app, and in-store environments. It also delivers near-instant transaction processing while automatically supporting new currencies and wallet applications as they become available. The partnership comes as more Americans are turning to digital assets for everyday transactions. Bealls cited a study that revealed that, as of early 2025, around 28% of US adults, which is estimated to be about 65 million people, own cryptocurrency. The collaboration with Flexa broadens the company’s footprint in brick-and-mortar retail while simultaneously advancing its goal of making digital payments as simple and widely accepted as card or mobile wallet transactions. In a statement, the Florida-based company’s Chairman and CEO, Matt Beall, said, “Digital currency will reshape how the world transacts, and Bealls is proud to be at the forefront of that transformation. Our partnership with Flexa is about more than payments; it’s about preparing for the future of commerce and continuing to innovate for the next 110 years.” Institutions Diving Deeper into Digital Assets Bealls’ move reflects a wider trend across finance and commerce, where institutions are steadily increasing exposure to blockchain-based investments. A study conducted by State Street found that allocations to cryptocurrencies, digital cash, and tokenized securities are expected to more than double by 2028. Over half of those surveyed believe tokenized assets will form up to a quarter of total portfolios by 2030. Asset managers are especially active, holding more Bitcoin and Ethereum than asset owners. A small but growing share is even experimenting with newer categories like meme coins and NFTs.

BTC is now up ~15% year-to-date and sits ~13% below its record close from earlier this month. ETH is now up ~16% year-to-date and is ~20% below its record close from August 2025. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price fell to its lowest level in over three months this week. BTC is now up ~15% year-to-date and sits ~13% below its record close from earlier this month. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price dropped further this week, hitting its lowest level in over two months. ETH is now up ~16% year-to-date and is ~20% below its record close from August 2025. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. A logarithmic scale is used on the y-axis of this chart to better illustrate the relative percentage changes and long-term growth of these cryptocurrencies, as opposed to their absolute price fluctuations. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

With over 21,000 investors joining in and the price rising every single hour , smart money is flooding in, especially from Ethereum whales seeking a hedge and diversification play in a volatile market. The presale is nearing its final stage, and only early buyers can still claim a 50% bonus with the code PATRIOTS100X before it sells out. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale: Price Rising Hourly, No Dips, Massive FOMO MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered rare territory — a presale that rises every hour and shows no dips in momentum. The demand has been explosive, with thousands of new wallets joining daily. The project’s safe infrastructure, verified audits, and community-first model have made it one of the most trusted presales in 2025. As traders search for the best crypto presale with real traction, MAGACOIN’s growth curve continues to outpace earlier hits like PEPE. What’s different this time is with real DeFi utility , creating a token that’s fun but functional. With the final presale phase approaching, the bonus offer (PATRIOTS100X) gives early participants 50% extra tokens , but only for a short time. Once this round closes, prices are expected to list higher on both CEX and DEX exchanges , which have reportedly begun discussions with the project team. Every minute counts now — MAGACOIN’s hourly price ticks upward, making timing crucial for those who want to maximize entry before listings go live. The project’s pace suggests it could be the best altcoin to buy before 2025’s next bull run begins. Ethereum Whales Move Early — Seeking the Best Crypto Presale for Safety and Hedge Ethereum’s long-term holders have begun positioning early into MAGACOIN FINANCE, a move that many see as a signal of where smart capital is rotating. After recent market corrections across major assets like Bitcoin and XRP, institutional-sized wallets are now chasing new presale opportunities that offer both safety and growth. Ethereum remains one of the most established assets in crypto, but even large holders are diversifying into younger altcoins that combine meme energy with real DeFi use cases. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out — offering audit-backed security, transparent tokenomics, and a community-owned foundation. In times of uncertainty, whales prefer projects that show legitimacy and reliability. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers just that: Fully audited (HashEx completed, CertiK ongoing) KYC-verified team No tax on trades Clear, transparent tokenomics For many high-net-worth investors, this is the best crypto presale to buy now for both hedge and early upside , especially as the token trades under $0.0006 , a price analysts say could “cancel two zeros” in the next major rally. A Hidden Gem Under $0.0006 — New Chance After XRP and Ethereum For investors who missed Ethereum’s rise from double digits or XRP’s breakout years ago, MAGACOIN FINANCE feels like the new opportunity . It’s a hidden gem under $0.0006 , gathering serious whale attention and retail enthusiasm alike. Analysts tracking whale flows confirm growing wallet activity around the presale contract, reflecting early positioning before the final stage ends. MAGACOIN combines scarcity, safety, and smart token design , giving it a real shot at being one of the best crypto presales of this cycle. In a market full of uncertainty, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a safe haven , a project where participants can grow without constant fear of price dips or hidden risks. With its transparent setup, hourly price increase, and upcoming exchange listings, it is not just another meme coin — it’s a secure entry into the next major wave of digital assets.

53516810,611532,1761177628,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53516810.jpeg,Tether Mints Another 1B USDT – $7B in Stablecoins Issued Since The Crash,https://bitcoinist.com/tether-mints-1b-usdt-7b-in-stablecoins-issued-crash/,"Tether has just minted another 1 billion USDT, only hours ago, reigniting debate over stablecoin-driven liquidity flows across the crypto market. The mint comes at a crucial time — Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim higher levels after weeks of volatility, while altcoins continue to bleed as if a full-blown bear market were underway. These mints tend to inject liquidity into exchanges, providing the capital needed for traders and market makers to re-enter positions or stabilize volatile price swings. While not always an immediate bullish catalyst, they frequently precede recoveries in market sentiment and volume. The latest mint follows a wave of renewed uncertainty across the crypto landscape, with investors closely watching Bitcoin’s $110K level as a make-or-break support zone. Altcoins, meanwhile, are experiencing double-digit declines, raising concerns that risk appetite remains weak. If history is any indication, this new influx of stablecoin liquidity could be setting the stage for a short-term rebound — or at least a temporary relief rally — as liquidity begins to circulate across major exchanges and derivative markets in the days ahead. A Liquidity Wave That Could Shake the Market According to data from Lookonchain, Tether and Circle have collectively minted over $7 billion in stablecoins since the October 10 market crash. This surge in new supply marks one of the most significant liquidity injections since midyear, sparking speculation about its potential impact on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Stablecoin mints on this scale often act as precursors to major price swings. While not a direct form of buying, they indicate that fresh capital is being positioned to enter the market — typically through market makers, institutional desks, or exchanges preparing for renewed trading activity. In this context, the $7 billion influx suggests that liquidity conditions are improving after the sharp drawdown that liquidated billions in long positions earlier this month. Related Reading: 2,496 Bitcoin Moved After Years Of Inactivity – Long-Term Holders Take Action However, such rapid capital movement can also heighten volatility. As this liquidity begins to circulate, it can amplify both sides of the market — first triggering relief rallies as buyers re-enter, and then sharp corrections as leveraged positions unwind. For Bitcoin, the timing is especially critical. With BTC still struggling to hold above $108K–$110K, this new liquidity could determine whether the next move is a bullish breakout or another leg lower. Historically, large stablecoin issuances have preceded upward shifts in Bitcoin’s price, but in a fragile market, they can also fuel speculative whipsaws. Tether’s USDT Dominance Rebounds As Traders Seek Stability Tether’s market dominance has risen sharply to around 5.06%, signaling a notable shift in sentiment as investors move capital into stablecoins amid heightened market volatility. The weekly chart shows a strong rebound from the 4.6% level, with USDT dominance now testing resistance near the 100-week moving average. This uptick coincides with the broader crypto market downturn following Bitcoin’s failure to hold key support at $110K and widespread selling across altcoins. Historically, rising USDT dominance reflects increased demand for safety — traders exiting volatile assets and parking capital in stablecoins to wait for clearer market direction. This pattern often precedes periods of accumulation, as sidelined liquidity builds up, ready to re-enter once confidence returns. From a technical standpoint, the structure suggests that a sustained breakout above 5.2% could extend the dominance rally toward 6%, a level last seen during previous market corrections. However, rejection here would imply stabilization and potential capital rotation back into risk assets.

The figure was posted on his social feed. Based on reports, that user base would represent about 6.25% of the global population. At the same time, USDT’s circulating supply is reported to be roughly $182 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Goes Big — $255M Longs Opened Before Trump–China Summit Tether Reports 500 Million Users The announcement came in a short social post from Ardoino celebrating the milestone. It’s the “biggest financial inclusion achievement” in history, he said. The company frames this as a major step for financial access, pointing to broad use in markets where traditional banking is limited. The method used to count “users” has not been made public, and the figure appears to be self-reported by Tether. Tether USDT reached officially 500 million users! Likely the biggest financial inclusion achievement in history. https://t.co/jbmnMDwidi — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) October 21, 2025 Use Patterns In Emerging Markets In several emerging economies, market participants say stablecoins are used for more than trading. They are used for cross-border payments, local transfers, and as a quick store of value when local currencies fall in value. Based on reports, people and businesses often move money into USDT to avoid volatility in their own currencies. That practical use is part of why the company emphasizes the inclusion angle. Market Size And Supply Figures USDT’s reported $182 billion supply places it among the largest stablecoins in circulation. Analysts tracking on-chain data note that a large portion of stablecoin flows still occur on major blockchains and centralized exchanges. Verification And Counting Caveats The 500 million claim has raised questions from industry observers and some analysts. How a “user” is defined is unclear: It wasn’t fully disclosed in detail if it is a unique person, a wallet address, an account on a partner platform, or an aggregate of multiple identifiers. Reports emphasize that without detailed methodology, outside verification is limited. The number should be viewed as a company figure that signals scale, but not as an independently audited headcount.

If even a portion of the 500 million are new entrants to digital finance, that would be significant. Meanwhile, regulators in several jurisdictions are watching stablecoins more closely. That scrutiny could affect how stablecoins are used in payments and remittances going forward.

Attendees included Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Senator Chuck Schumer from New York. Other industry names like Kraken co-CEO David Ripley and Uniswap Labs’ Hayden Adams were present. Nazarov said this wasn’t the usual roundtable. “It was definitely some more senior senators speaking at once,” he said. “They realize the economic value of the industry is high, so they need to address how they are going to deal with it, they need to address it correctly.” Crypto industry demands answers Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov joined a dozen leaders in a nearly three-hour sit-down and two separate meetings, first with Democrats, then with Republicans. The first session, lasting about an hour and a half, included questions from Democratic lawmakers about decentralized finance and illicit use of crypto. Schumer joined briefly. Nazarov said the tone was serious, and that lawmakers seemed focused on figuring out how to engage with the space without losing control. The second meeting ran for just over an hour and was with Republican lawmakers. According to Nazarov, they were much more direct in their support. The central topic in both rooms was the same: the market-structure legislation, which was supposed to go to markup in late October. But with the federal government in shutdown mode, nothing’s moved. The bill aims to create rules that separate commodities from securities and assign clear roles to regulators. That’s critical for companies like Kraken and Coinbase, who want to know which agencies they’ll be dealing with and what compliance looks like. Right now, that clarity doesn’t exist. “The meeting was productive, with stakeholders providing feedback and reaffirming support for a bipartisan approach,” said Jeff Naft, spokesperson for the Senate Banking Committee’s Republican side. He also pushed Democrats to commit to a markup date and stop dragging their feet. Earlier this year, both parties managed to pass a stablecoin bill, which was signed by President Donald Trump in July. Don’t just read crypto news. Understand it. Subscribe to our newsletter.

The season will go live next week on October 28, featuring new maps, weapons, and tactical modes that expand the fast-paced combined arms combat the series is famous for. Based on the recently released trailer, Blackwell Fields, a new map, has been updated and set on an extensive air base in California. The landscape features oil wells, burning fields, and vast open spaces, ideal for massive battles that involve both ground and air vehicles. The map will debut with the season’s first phase, called Rogue Ops. EA confirms that Season One will release in three phases The first phase has also featured a new 4v4 tactical mode inspired by classics like Search and Destroy and Counter-Strike. The game allows only one life per round, making it critical for gamers to make decisions carefully. For teams to secure a win, they must either eliminate the enemy or capture a single objective point. Battlefield 6 Season One has maintained squad revives, adding an extra layer of coordination and teamwork. New kits and vehicles are also part of the latest release. Gamers can expect to wield the SOR-300 Carbine, the Mini Fix sniper rifle, the GGH-22 pistol, and equip new attachments like the Rail Cover and Low-Powered Variable Optic (LPVO). The game has also introduced a new armored personnel vehicle, which will boost defense and attack abilities across large maps. EA confirmed that Season One will open in three stages, each bringing fresh content towards the end of the year. The second phase, called California Resistance, will be released on November 18, with a new map named Eastwood. The new map features a dense battlefield inspired by Southern California’s upscale neighborhoods and golf courses. Based on the trailer, Eastwood’s map layout appears different from Blackwell Field’s open expanses. Gamers have a chance to move tanks and air vehicles within the suburban homes featuring golf carts and pools. Gamers can also engage in close-quarters firefights in hotels and country clubs. The second phase will also include the new Sabotage mode, an 8v8 limited-time experience where teams alternate between attacking and defending cargo objectives. Lastly, the third stage, called the Winter Offensive, will be released on December 9, introducing a winter-themed map. The map features an ice climbing axe melee weapon and a special limited-time event named Ice Lock. Battlefield 6 has sold over 7 million copies since launch Battlefield 6 sold over seven million copies within its first week of launch, marking one of the most successful launches in EA’s shooter portfolio. The publisher has maintained strong servers and focused on refining balance and regular patches for the Battlefield 6 series. Gaming communities have shown higher expectations as Battlefield 6 continues to evolve, blending massive warfare, detailed maps, and new tactical game modes. The publisher hopes to meet such expectations and establish the game as one of the defining multiplayer experiences of the decade. Cryptopolitan uncovered that copies of the upcoming game release for PS5 had already leaked, based on Reddit posts ahead of its official launch. Based on the posts shared on Reddit, the received copy had a PEGI rating, indicating that an unnamed European retailer sold it. The Reddit user confirmed that the servers were already online ahead of the expected official start on October 10. However, gamers who obtain earlier access usually lack online features until the official release. The disclosure signaled that EA may have already opened its servers for multiplayer testing and set up for the final pre-launch. The disc copy for the PS5 edition occupies 68GB, and it is also available on Xbox Series X. For Xbox Series S, there is a smaller version occupying only 39GB.

This includes jet engines and laptops. A US official and three individuals who acquired information from US authorities noted that this move is in response to China’s recent decision to impose limitations on rare earth exports. Although this is not the only option being discussed, sources have highlighted that the proposed plan aligns with US President Donald Trump’s earlier warning this month regarding the blocking of the export of important software to the country by setting up restrictions on the global shipment of products that either utilize US software or were developed with it. Trump’s limitation plan under consideration raises controversy among individuals Trump shared a social media post dated October 10 stating that he would impose an additional 100% tariff on products shipped from China to the US. This was in addition to new export controls on all essential software, which is set to take effect by November 1. However, the president did not provide further information on the situation. This announcement heightened fear among personnel of US and Chinese technology companies. To allay these fears, credible sources have reported that there’s an excellent chance they won’t even happen. Still, two sources close to the situation acknowledged that the idea of these controls suggests that the Trump administration is considering escalating its existing conflict with China. Frightened by the impact of this trade war, some officials in the US government have called on the administration to consider a softer approach . Meanwhile, considering the intense nature of the situation, reporters reached out to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the White House to request that he comment on possible software restrictions on China. “I can confirm that everything is under consideration,” he asserted. Bessent further explained that if these export restrictions on products such as software, engines, or other items are implemented, they would likely be done in collaboration with their G7 partners. Interestingly, US stock markets experienced a drastic decline after Trump’s restriction announcement went viral, but analysts confirmed that they recovered some of their losses later. According to the reports, the S&P 500 ended the day down by 0.5%, and the Nasdaq was roughly 1% lower by the end of trading. Emily Kilcrease at the Center for a New American Security weighed in on the topic of discussion. She mentioned that software is a clear area where the US can apply pressure. However, according to her, enforcing such controls would be challenging and could harm US-based businesses. “You would hope they are only making threats that they plan to follow through on,” Kilcrease added. China pledges to retaliate against the US’s proposed plans with strong measures A Chinese embassy representative did not directly respond to the specifics of the US actions under consideration, but said that China firmly opposes the US imposing unilateral long-arm jurisdiction measures. The representative also pointed out that the Asian country warned it would take strong countermeasures to protect its legitimate rights and interests if the US insists on continuing with this plan, which they called a “wrong path.” In the meantime, one source with knowledge of the situation suggested that officials in the administration may announce plans to pressure China, without actually implementing these actions. Additionally, two other sources highlighted that more focused policy alternatives are being debated. Following debates about the scope of the proposed move, a source, which wished to remain anonymous, expressed that everything one can imagine is made with US software. Don’t just read crypto news.

While XRP continues to hold a strong position in cross-border payments, its growth curve appears to be slowing as new DeFi-focused platforms rise to prominence. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as a top crypto to buy, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional investors. Currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM’s momentum signals growing confidence in its innovative ecosystem. Mutuum Finance is redefining decentralized lending, offering real utility potential that many legacy altcoins can’t match. XRP Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) fell hard in recent market volatility, losing more than 50% and printing out a large wick to about $1.25, setting what now looks like a false breakout below an important level of support. On the daily chart, from an Elliott Wave view, XRP appears to be finishing microwave 5 of primary wave C, which could again set up for the run at heavy support to see the token fall more than 30% from today’s levels. In the last year, XRP has developed an expanding flat (ABC/3-3-5) and the $2.4 level has been consistently both resistance and support, drawing significant volume. Most importantly, XRP’s low correlation to Bitcoin (BTC) is an ideal candidate for strategic trading. Traders are testing these pivotal levels for the possibility of a rebound or breakdown, and others are checking out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gaining interest for the upcoming cycle of markets in preparation, making it the best crypto to buy now. Mutuum Finance Exceeds Expectations Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most optimistic new DeFi coins. Its usage is increasing at a more rapid pace than initially anticipated, with over 17,340 investors in the presale alone, investing over $17.75 million. These figures put Mutuum Finance as the leading investment vehicle for anyone looking for a cryptocurrency with vast long-term value potential before the next bull run, earning its place as a top crypto to buy. One of the largest milestones for Mutuum Finance’s roadmap is launching its lending and borrowing protocol , which will occur soon. Version 1 (V1) will launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and feature a number of decentralized finance products including liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the Liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be integrated fully for borrowing and lending, creating early access for users in a secure, low-interest, and fully decentralized lending system. This accomplishment not only makes Mutuum Finance’s investment highly sought after but also makes it one of the most successful new crypto coin launches with enormous long-term growth potential. Community Participation in Daily Leaderboard MUTM leaderboard provides incentives for the biggest purchases of tokens in a 24-hour window, encouraging healthy community participation. Within the last 24 hours, the largest buyers spent $7,036 and $6,619 respectively, indicating increasing activity along with investor sentiment. The day’s top buyer gets rewarded with a $500 MUTM bonus. All users need to do is make at least one trade within a 24-hour window. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the best altcoins to keep an eye on this cycle. Phase 6 presale tokens are valued at $0.035, with more than 70% sold and $17.75 million raised from 17,340 investors. Daily leaderboard activity, along with $500 MUTM prizes, shows increasing community participation and investor sentiment. With its two-lending DeFi approach and upcoming V1 lending protocol on Sepolia Testnet, MUTM balances early-stage potential with actual utility. Investors who want high-growth crypto opportunities need to act now to lock up tokens before Phase 7, making MUTM a top crypto to buy for the current cycle.

Bulls Hold $2.38 Support As Breakout Pressure Builds,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-bounce-in-sight/,"XRP is holding firm above the $2.38 support level after a recent pullback, suggesting that bulls may still have control. As buying pressure builds, traders are watching closely for a potential breakout that could reignite bullish momentum in the coming sessions. Early Strength Fades After Hitting $2.52 Umair Crypto, in his latest market update, noted that XRP displayed initial strength after rebounding cleanly from the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The price managed to climb to around $2.52 with a solid close on the 4-hour chart, signaling renewed buyer interest and a potential shift in short-term momentum.

The failure to extend higher has started to reveal some underlying weakness in the chart, with bulls struggling to sustain momentum at higher levels. Umair emphasized that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) trendline now plays a crucial role in determining the next direction. A confirmed breakdown below this RSI trendline could lead to another lower low, effectively continuing the current local downtrend and reinforcing bearish sentiment in the market. For now, the situation remains uncertain. XRP must hold firmly above the $2.38 support level and maintain strength along the RSI trendline. However, a failure to do so could expose XRP to deeper downside risks in the short term. Momentum Or Pause? The Decisive Moment For XRP MakroVision Research highlighted that XRP successfully halted its steep decline within the lower Golden Pocket region, between approximately $1.40 and $1.55, and has recovered as buying pressure resurfaced. In the short term, the firm noted that XRP is now approaching a key resistance range between $2.48 and $2.65.

A failure to break above this zone could lead to temporary consolidation as the market gathers momentum for its next move. On the downside, the $1.96 level remains a critical support area, as losing it could reintroduce downside pressure. From an upside perspective, a decisive and sustained breakout above $2.65 could open the door for further gains toward $3.06. According to MakroVision Research, only a move beyond this level would confirm renewed bullish strength and restore clear upward momentum across the broader trend. In conclusion, the analyst emphasized that XRP’s precise targeting of the Golden Pocket and its swift recovery show that buyers are still active and defending key zones. However, the next major test lies in whether the bulls can generate enough momentum to overcome the $2.65 resistance and set the stage for a broader rally.
