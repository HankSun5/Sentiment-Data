Still, the latest dips could be setting the stage for one of the strongest bullish rallies in recent history. In early October, Bitcoin skyrocketed to a record-breaking $126,080, briefly sending capital surging into major altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which had already shattered their previous yearly highs. That momentum didn’t last long. Later that same week, the market slipped sharply after former President Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports. Investor sentiment quickly turned cautious in anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC decision. Nonetheless, several analysts view the correction as a necessary cooldown, clearing out excessive leverage and weaker positions before the next sustained uptrend. Below are three top altcoins to consider based on their upside potential. Ripple (XRP): 2025’s Cross-Border Payment Powerhouse Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , underpins a global payment system known for rapid transactions and ultra-low fees, posing a growing challenge to legacy networks like SWIFT. Backed by the UN Capital Development Fund and partnered with prominent U.S. financial institutions, XRP has risen to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at $143.8 billion. The introduction of Ripple’s dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, underscores the company’s ambition to capture a share of the booming stablecoin sector. Over the past 12 months, XRP has gained 349%, reaching a seven-year high of $3.65 in mid-July, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 62% growth in the same period. With an RSI reading of 39 and a clear divergence from its 30-day moving average, XRP appears poised for renewed upward movement this week. Technical patterns reveal two bullish flags formed over the summer, suggesting potential for continued growth if ETF approvals materialize by mid-October. Should U.S. lawmakers enact comprehensive crypto legislation, XRP could climb even further, possibly landing between $5 and $10. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Prime Rival and This Week’s Market Leader Solana ($SOL) continues to reinforce its reputation as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain platforms. With a market cap hovering above $100 billion and almost $11 billion locked in its DeFi ecosystem, Solana’s network expansion shows no signs of slowing down. Investors are closely watching for potential approval of U.S.-based Solana spot ETFs, which could attract significant institutional inflows similar to those seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. After bottoming out near $100 in April, SOL now trades around $184. Improved regulatory clarity has lifted investor confidence, while technical indicators, an RSI of 40, and a notable deviation from its 30-day moving average, suggest SOL might currently be undervalued. Support remains firm around $150, with major resistance near $250. A clean break above this level could spark another major rally, potentially revisiting its all-time high of $293.31 or even surpassing $500 in a strong bull market. TRON (TRX): Justin Sun’s Blockchain Defies the Downtrend Founded in 2017 by Justin Sun, TRON ($TRX) was designed as a direct competitor to Ethereum. Today, it stands as the second-largest layer one “Ethereum killer” after Solana, boasting a market cap of roughly $30.4 billion compared to Solana’s $100.6 billion. Like Ethereum and Solana, TRON supports sophisticated smart contracts that power a wide range of DeFi applications, from gaming and NFTs to lending and asset tokenization. At present, TRON is the only top-10 cryptocurrency posting gains amid a market-wide decline. While the global crypto market capitalization of $3.74 trillion fell 5% overnight, with Bitcoin dropping 4% and Ethereum and Solana both shedding about 6%. Meanwhile, TRON only fell 1% to $0.3127. Currently, TRON remains 25% below its all-time high of $0.4313, recorded on December 4, 2024. The sharp upward movement on its chart shows a rapid surge of buying activity that drove a 76% increase within 24 hours. TRON may encounter resistance near its prior peak, but a breakout could see prices approach the $0.50 mark. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): 2025’s Breakout Meme Coin Uniting Bitcoin Power and Innovation Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has quickly become one of 2025’s most talked-about presale tokens. The project enhances Bitcoin’s capabilities through a proprietary Layer-2 solution, enabling lightning-fast, low-cost transfers wrapped in a meme coin format. Built for scalability and utility, HYPER introduces decentralized governance via a DAO, advanced smart contracts, and superior transaction speeds, all atop its unique Layer-2 framework. The presale has already raised over $24.5 million, with analysts predicting potential 10x or greater returns post-launch. Developed on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER’s ecosystem includes a seamless Canonical Bridge for Bitcoin transfers, decentralized app compatibility, and built-in meme coin integration. A recent audit by Coinsult confirmed zero security vulnerabilities, further strengthening investor trust. HYPER tokens power key network functions such as staking, governance, and transaction fees, offering early investors staking rewards as high as 48% APY. Bitcoin is going HYPER, don’t miss the start of something big. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

The project recently passed a 16,000 investor milestone , indicating the large level of confidence from both retail and early institutional players. This milestone represents one of the most successful presales for 2025 . It underlines the capacity of the project to attract the trust of a cautious market still recovering from past volatility. Analysts now call MAGACOIN FINANCE a top candidate for 2025’s best crypto presale with the potential for 100x returns post-listing . Investors Rush In Before Prices Move Higher Investor growth has been faster than expected. Each of the presale rounds has closed early, indicating that interest continues to rise. Buyers are rushing to enter early to maximize their entries before the next price tier is activated. This continuous stream of investors demonstrates that their confidence in MAGACOIN FINANCE is not hype, but genuine. The project has been an eye catcher to individuals who prefer structure over bewildering marketing claims. All changes have been transparent, all progress has been visible, and all progress has been steady. That stability has ensured that MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most stable early-stage crypto projects in 2025. Trust Built on Transparency and Security The success of MAGACOIN FINANCE is based on transparency. The entire audit of the project was conducted by HashEx , a reputable blockchain security company that has high standards. The audit has ensured that the MAGACOIN FINANCE contract is fully safe and it has no concealed risks. This confirmation has given both new and old investors confidence that has been shaken by market deceits in the recent past. Its tiered pricing structure also adds to the fairness equation by rewarding early participants and managing token allocation. This way, a healthy ecosystem is developed, and heavy dumping is prevented after listing. Transparency, safety, and fairness have been the perfect case of reliability. MAGACOIN FINANCE is considered a safe and serious project that is not a short-term gamble. Exchange Listings Add to the Excitement The upcoming exchange listings have created more buzz among investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE will be launching on some of the popular trading platforms soon after the end of the presale. Listings often play a major role in price discovery. Analysts expect to see a strong demand from traders who did not have the opportunity to buy the token before it was available on the public market. This next step could draw in another wave of attention as investors see listings as validation. With the foundations already well-built on verified security and an increasing support from the community, the launch of MAGACOIN FINANCE on exchanges could be the start of its recognition in the wider market. As the momentum of the coin grows, there are now many calling it the best crypto to buy early, as returns are expected to increase as the liquidity rises post-launch. Analysts Predict 100x ROI Potential Analysts still believe that early players have a significant advantage. According to them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the combination of timing, credibility, and enthusiasm of investors, three components of most 100x stories. The Patriot50X bonus , providing the buyer with 50% additional tokens included in the project, has served to solidify the enthusiasm. It has propelled fresh investors in the short run and given them the confidence to participate in the long run. The whales are also starting to silently position themselves as well, and the project is viewed as a unique early opportunity where there is safety and growth potential. Final Outlook MAGACOIN FINANCE has acquired 16,000+ investors, has passed a confirmed audit, and has verified future exchange listings. These achievements demonstrate that its emergence is not accidental – it is organized, structured, and community-driven. With transparent updates, clear rewards, and a strong foundation, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as one of the best crypto presales of 2025 . Its stability, ease, and earlier trust place it in an ideal position to serve a market that is willing to trust once more.

The October rally enthusiasm, aka “Uptober”, abruptly ended after President Donald Trump announced sweeping 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, a move that rattled global markets and sparked one of crypto’s sharpest one-day sell-offs in recent memory. With the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC meeting approaching, traders are adopting a cautious stance, waiting for hints of potential monetary easing that could reignite risk appetite. Veteran analysts, however, view the recent pullback as a positive development, emphasizing that steep corrections tend to purge speculative excess and leveraged positions, often laying the groundwork for more durable long-term gains. Binance Coin (BNB): Perplexity AI sees Expanding Dominance Firstly, Binance Coin ($BNB) was originally designed as the exchange’s utility token, but it has evolved into one of the most multifaceted digital assets, driving a growing ecosystem that spans NFTs, decentralized apps, and payment solutions. Source: Perplexity AI BNB’s deflationary design, sustained through Binance’s periodic token burns, continues to support its long-term price resilience by systematically reducing supply over time. Its utility now extends far beyond the Binance platform, with BNB gaining traction among merchants worldwide, from gaming platforms to travel service providers. This widespread adoption has solidified its position among the world’s top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This month, BNB reached a record high of $1,369.99 before pulling back around 21%, following a strong breakout from a bullish pennant formation that developed earlier in the year. Currently showing an RSI of 47, BNB appears to be consolidating between buying and selling pressure. Should bullish momentum return, Perplexity AI believes BNB could push toward the $1,600 mark before the year’s end, while $580–$1,000 may serve as a key support zone in the event of another correction. XRP ($XRP): Claude Predicts a Potential Surge Toward $10 Claude AI’s modeling suggests Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , could see a dramatic upswing, possibly reaching between $5.50 and $6.20 by year-end, more than doubling its current value of about $2.40. Ripple’s landmark victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year ended a five-year legal saga, restoring investor confidence and driving XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 on July 18. Over the past year, XRP has skyrocketed 349%, handily outperforming Bitcoin’s 62% and Ethereum’s 46% gains. Technical analysis shows three distinct bullish flag formations in 2025, two of which emerged during the summer months, often a prelude to major upward moves. Strong seasonal tailwinds in October, potential ETF approvals, favorable regulatory developments, and Ripple’s expanding global partnerships could all help XRP recover recent losses and move closer to the $6 threshold, with $10 being a sober target in a bull-case scenario. Solana (SOL): Claude Forecasts a Break Above $500 Solana ($SOL) continues to reinforce its standing as one of the premier smart contract blockchains, boasting a market cap of more than $100 billion and almost $11 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its DeFi ecosystem. Speculation is heating up that U.S. regulators could approve a spot Solana ETF before the month’s end, a move that could attract substantial institutional capital, echoing the surges seen after Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launches. Solana also stands to benefit from broader industry trends such as the tokenization of real-world assets and the expansion of stablecoin infrastructure, both of which are gaining institutional momentum. Additionally, with transaction speeds and fees outpacing Ethereum’s, Solana remains one of the strongest contenders for mass adoption. After rising to $250 in January and retracing to $100 in April, SOL now trades near $184, suggesting renewed bullish potential. Its low RSI of 40 and proximity below its 30-day moving average indicate the asset may currently be undervalued. Having recently broken out of a bullish flag pattern, Claude projects that Solana could reach between $360 and $500 by year’s end, a rise of up to 70% above its previous all-time high of $293.31. Missed Dogecoin? Meet Maxi Doge (MAXI): The Next-Gen Meme Coin With Degen Energy Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a new entrant in the meme coin arena, has launched its presale phase, already drawing over $3.7 million from investors eager to ride the next viral crypto trend. Branded as Dogecoin’s “high-octane cousin,” Maxi Doge embraces the humor, hype, and community-driven ethos of crypto’s degen culture, focusing on engagement, viral memes, and grassroots participation. Developed as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI offers quicker, more cost-efficient, and eco-friendly transactions compared to traditional meme coins. The project’s marketing strategy centers on Telegram and Discord community events, trading competitions, and influencer collaborations to build early traction. Of its total 150.24 billion token supply, 25% is allocated to a “Maxi Fund” dedicated to marketing, ecosystem growth, and strategic partnerships. Staking is live, with yields reaching up to 82% APY, a figure that gradually decreases as more stakers join. The presale currently values MAXI at $0.000264, with incremental price increases set for each funding milestone. Investors can purchase tokens via MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Experts are now targeting a potential rise toward $200,000, identifying this new all-time high level as Bitcoin’s potential cycle top while suggesting that the cryptocurrency has yet to establish a definitive bottom. Bitcoin Price Explosion To Ignite Biggest Altcoin Season Ever According to digital asset analyst CrediBULL Crypto, Bitcoin’s next parabolic surge could catalyze the biggest altcoin season the market has ever seen. The analyst shared an Elliott Wave chart analysis, showing that BTC is in the early stages of its final fifth wave, a phase that has historically delivered some of the most explosive price rallies in bull markets. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Supercycle Still In Play? Wave 3 Tells A Story Of A Surge Looking at the chart, the first subwave of Wave 5 has already produced a 37% gain, suggesting that the upcoming third and fifth subwaves could be significantly larger, potentially driving Bitcoin well above $150,000 and even toward the $200,000 mark. CrediBULL Crypto argued that such a bullish move will not be grounded in logic or fundamentals but in market psychology, specifically speculation, greed, and euphoria. He revealed that this emotional environment often leads to extreme volatility, which fuels liquidity rotation into alternative cryptocurrencies. Historically, when investors begin redirecting capital away from Bitcoin into altcoins after a BTC top, it typically sparks a full-blown altcoin season. Many smaller-cap assets experience rapid, exponential gains during this time, especially as the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) declines temporarily. CrediBULL Crypto emphasizes that this phase of irrational exuberance is a natural part of the market cycle. When the Bitcoin mania peaks, the resulting FOMO often drives investors to seek higher and faster yields in other assets. The analyst further added that as long as BTC continues to climb, altcoins are likely to follow suit. Analyst Recommends Locking In Ahead Of The Rally In a prior analysis on X social media, CrediBULL Crypto reaffirmed his belief that the current market cycle top has not yet been reached. Despite recent volatility and market crash fueled by the devastating liquidation event on October 10, the analyst maintains that Bitcoin remains structurally bullish on High-Timeframes (HTFs). Related Reading: Expert Says ‘The Time Has Come’, What Could Drive The Next Explosive Altcoin Season He noted that the recent market pullbacks could offer opportunities for traders affected by the liquidation cascade to rebuild positions ahead of the next explosive leg. He stated that even a small allocation, about 10% of their previous holdings, could yield substantial returns if the projected parabolic move unfolds. CrediBULL Crypto has highlighted a critical invalidation level near $74,000, suggesting that as long as the Bitcoin price holds above this zone, its long-term uptrend remains intact. He doubled down on his bullish projection, insisting that the next major rally could propel BTC significantly above $150,000.

Waller at the Payments Innovation Conference on October 21, 2025, Fed staff are examining a new kind of account that would let certain non-bank firms connect directly to the central bank’s payment system. Reports have disclosed the idea is being called a “payment account” or informally a “skinny” master account. What The Federal Reserve Is Proposing The plan would stop short of giving full bank privileges. The accounts would likely not earn interest and would not have access to the Fed’s discount window. Balance caps and other risk limits are expected to be part of the design. Waller said staff are still working through the details and that the concept remains exploratory rather than a finalized rule. Limits And Safeguards Regulators intend to keep guardrails. According to public comments, only “legally eligible” entities would qualify. That phrase leaves open which corporate forms — for example, trust companies, state-chartered firms or other charter types — will be allowed. Fed opens the gates for fintech and crypto access Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller revealed today that the Fed is studying a new model of “payment accounts”. Streamlined accounts that would allow fintech and crypto firms to access the Fed’s payment infrastructure,… https://t.co/QphKaopcRo — StrongSHx (@StrongSHX) October 21, 2025 Reports note the accounts would be smaller in scope than a normal master account, with explicit restrictions aimed at reducing exposure to the payment system. Oversight, AML/KYC checks and operational risk controls are expected to be central to any application process. Why This Matters Now Access to the Fed’s rails has long been limited to banks, which forced many fintech and crypto firms to rely on intermediary banks. Connecting directly, even in a limited way, could reduce steps in settlement and cut certain counterparty risks. There is also context: the Fed withdrew earlier guidance on bank crypto activities this year — on April 24, 2025 — signaling a shift in tone toward integrating new players into payments. Who Stands To Gain Or Lose Crypto firms and stablecoin issuers could find it easier to move funds and settle transactions. Banks that currently provide access to non-banks may face stiffer competition for those services. At the same time, regulators and bank supervisors will still carry the burden of preventing fraud, illicit finance and operational breakdowns. Market participants are likely to watch how the Fed coordinates with the OCC and the FDIC on questions of charters and deposit insurance.

According to the UK’s top banking supervisor, granting UK banks and building societies relief on their £150 billion gilt holdings, as well as their multibillion-pound foreign government bond portfolios, would “risk forgetting one of the main lessons from the 2023 banking failures.” Speaking at the annual Mansion House regulators’ dinner in London on Wednesday, Woods said such a move would be “equivalent to ripping off our jacket, warm hat and gloves and throwing them all over the nearest cliff,” describing it as “profound — and highly risky.” Lessons from 2023 bank failures highlight risks of relaxing leverage ratios Bank lobbyists in Britain and the United States have called on regulators this year to exclude sovereign debt from leverage ratio calculations, which dictate how much capital banks must hold for each dollar of assets. In the UK, it would release around £5 billion of equity capital currently trapped in gilt portfolios at a minimum leverage ratio of 3.25%. Woods, a BoE deputy governor who is set to step down in 2026, noted that the failure of three mid-sized US banks over two years ago — including Silicon Valley Bank — indicated “bonds issued by sound governments, if liquidated in size, can carry major consequences to banks’ balance sheets due to interest rate risk”. SVB’s 2023 collapse, which also affected its UK subsidiary, followed losses on its large US government bond holdings after interest rates rose sharply, sparking a depositor run. Woods added that lifting capital requirements on government debt could “allow a very large increase in bank leverage given the size of banks’ sovereign holdings” and would “largely remove sovereign risk from the bank capital framework” unless banks actively sell the bonds. UK Finance, the main lobbying group for British banks, has previously proposed exempting gilts from leverage ratio calculations as part of its “plan for growth” regulatory reforms. Meanwhile, in June, the US Federal Reserve proposed lowering the leverage ratio for the country’s biggest banks from at least 5% to between 3.5% and 4.25%, aligning more closely with international standards. The Fed did not include a government debt exemption in the proposal. Still, it sought feedback on it as a potential “additional modification,” amid lobbying arguments that it could improve liquidity in US Treasury markets. Financial sector urged to strengthen cybersecurity and risk resilience Speaking at the Mansion House gathering, Nikhil Rathi, CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority, stated that there is growing recognition in the UK of the need to manage cyber risks. He cited the £1.9 billion cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover this year as an illustration of the threats faced by UK businesses. He said that too often, finance had been seen as independent of national security, with insufficient investment in long-term resilience. Rathi also noted that most catastrophe- and cyber-risks in the world remain uninsured, leaving companies, credit ratings, risk premia rates, prices, and ultimately households to bear the burden. Calling on banks and insurers to “step up”, Rathi added: “Let’s all harness the City’s expertise to address the insurance challenges. We will keep shining a light on both the risks and opportunities.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The interest comes just weeks after the New York-based company wrapped up a $300 million funding round that valued it at $5 billion. Venture capital firms are now lining up to pour more cash in, with some discussions floating valuations as high as $12 billion. The people involved in the talks didn’t want to be named because the details are private, but the appetite for this startup is clearly heating up. Earlier this month, Kalshi said its latest round was co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. Back in June, the company raised $185 million at a $2 billion valuation, led by crypto-focused investor Paradigm. Kalshi lets users trade on the outcomes of real-world events, anything from presidential elections and sports games to the duration of a government shutdown. In a recent post on X, co-founder and CEO Tarek Mansour said the company’s annualized trading volume hit $50 billion. Kalshi expands after court win and surging volumes For years, regulators treated prediction markets like a legal grey zone. That changed after Kalshi’s court victory last October, which gave it the right to list presidential election contracts. The ruling ignited a flood of trading on the platform, sending volumes to new highs. Kalshi used its federal license to open markets on sports contests nationwide, expanding what users can legally trade on. This move has boosted its growth and put it in a tighter race with its closest competitor, Polymarket. One person familiar with the company’s latest fundraising reportedly told Bloomberg that the new capital could “strengthen Kalshi’s position in a crowded and fast-moving space.” Both platforms have become magnets for speculators betting on everything from political outcomes to global sports events. Venture capital firms are allegedly competing for early stakes in Kalshi and even making unsolicited, preemptive offers before the company even opens new fundraising rounds. Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has allowed Kalshi to expand its event-based markets, but state gaming regulators, who traditionally oversee sports betting, have been pushing back in court. The CFTC says it still has concerns of market manipulation and insider trading in platforms like this. Wall Street companies and gambling operators are moving fast to partner with prediction exchanges before the industry matures. The National Hockey League this week announced multiyear partnerships with both Kalshi and Polymarket, making it the first major U.S. sports league to embrace these markets directly. At the same time, the industry is seeing an arms race in valuations.Just recently, Cryptopolitan reported that the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns the New York Stock Exchange, would invest up to $2 billion in Polymarket at a valuation of around $8 billion, a massive jump from its $1 billion market cap earlier this year in a Founders Fund-led round.

The automaker said the AI assistant will also tap into the cars’ data to provide alerts, pre-condition the climate inside the cars, and explain driving features. GM said the AI assistant will be preinstalled in both gas and electric cars using the Android Automotive operating system for infotainment. The company is among the first automakers to integrate the Gemini update directly into its cars. Gemini will also become the default voice recognition system, which is expected to possess strong natural language capabilities. However, given the unpredictable nature of generative AI chatbots, GM clarified that it remains to be seen how reliable Gemini will perform on the roads and whether it will consistently make other automatic adjustments, such as climate control. The company stated that its latest upgrade directly competed with Tesla’s xAI Grok and Mercedes’s ChatGPT. Richardson claims GM’s Gemini-powered AI assistant performs better GM’s Vice President of Software and Services, Dave Richardson, said his company’s Gemini-powered AI assistant will perform better than other AI assistants. However, he pointed out that one of the challenges with most AI assistants is that they are frustrating because they do not understand accents very well. They also do not know how to respond appropriately when words are not spoken correctly. Richardson asserted that the most remarkable thing about large language models (LLMs) is that they appear to be unaffected by the above problem. He clarified that such systems have context about previous conversations, which they can retrieve for reference. “They’re flexible in how you speak to them…so overall you’re getting a better, more natural experience.” – Dave Richardson , Vice President of Software and Services at GM The automaker believes that the Gemini-powered AI assistant will make drafting and sending messages, prepping for meetings, or even planning routes with extra stops on the go an enjoyable experience. The assistant will also have internet access, enabling it to crawl the web for answers to specific questions. However, Richardson stressed that drivers will have control over the information accessed or used by the assistant. GM said the new voice assistant is a step towards developing its custom-built AI to connect to cars through GM’s in-car concierge, OnStar. The assistant will be available via Google’s Play Store as an over-the-air upgrade to OnStar-equipped cars produced from 2015 onwards. GM unveils plans for a hands-off, eyes-off driver-assistant system At the GM Forward event, the automaker’s CEO, Mary Barra, announced that her company plans to introduce a new driver-assist system, allowing drivers to take their eyes off the road or be hands-free, starting in 2028. She added that the company was also showcasing other initiatives designed to transform its cars from modes of transportation to intelligent assistants. GM further announced that it is developing a new centralized computing platform, which is expected to start rolling out with the Escalade IQ in 2028. Barra said at the event in lower Manhattan that her company is ready to usher in a new era of mobility. Sterling Anderson, GM’s Chief Product Officer, said the company’s vision is to produce a car that knows and looks out for its driver. Anderson believes centralized computing is a foundational piece of GM’s plans to improve the capabilities of its cars. The automaker also emphasized its plans to upgrade ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems) to feature eyes-off, hands-free driving technology. GM expects to roll out the driving assistance feature in 2028, beginning with the Cadillac Escalade IQ EV. Anderson said this autonomy will make roads safer. Anderson explained that GM’s future cars will utilize lidar (light detection and ranging) systems to enhance their ability to detect their surroundings. He added that the system is expected to reach its full potential through incremental transformations. Get seen where it counts.

With this integration, Bealls becomes the first national retailer to accept digital currencies from any crypto wallet across more than a dozen blockchains at once. The announcement marks Bealls’ 110th anniversary and highlights the company’s ongoing focus on innovation and improving customer experience. Over the years, the retailer has invested in new technologies, such as in-store kiosks and online shopping, and this latest move places it among the early adopters of crypto payments in physical retail. Bealls Makes a Crypto Leap According to the official press release, the system supports a wide range of assets, including stablecoins and meme coins. Customers will be able to make purchases using digital currencies at Bealls, Bealls Florida, and Home Centric stores. As part of the deal, the retailer will utilize Flexa Payments, a digital payment solution designed for speed and versatility. The platform enables merchants to accept over 99 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and stablecoins such as USDC, from more than 300 different wallets. Flexa Payments connects with existing retail systems and operates across mobile, in-app, and in-store environments. It also delivers near-instant transaction processing while automatically supporting new currencies and wallet applications as they become available. The partnership comes as more Americans are turning to digital assets for everyday transactions. Bealls cited a study that revealed that, as of early 2025, around 28% of US adults, which is estimated to be about 65 million people, own cryptocurrency. The collaboration with Flexa broadens the company’s footprint in brick-and-mortar retail while simultaneously advancing its goal of making digital payments as simple and widely accepted as card or mobile wallet transactions. In a statement, the Florida-based company’s Chairman and CEO, Matt Beall, said, “Digital currency will reshape how the world transacts, and Bealls is proud to be at the forefront of that transformation. Our partnership with Flexa is about more than payments; it’s about preparing for the future of commerce and continuing to innovate for the next 110 years.” Institutions Diving Deeper into Digital Assets Bealls’ move reflects a wider trend across finance and commerce, where institutions are steadily increasing exposure to blockchain-based investments. A study conducted by State Street found that allocations to cryptocurrencies, digital cash, and tokenized securities are expected to more than double by 2028. Over half of those surveyed believe tokenized assets will form up to a quarter of total portfolios by 2030. Asset managers are especially active, holding more Bitcoin and Ethereum than asset owners. A small but growing share is even experimenting with newer categories like meme coins and NFTs.

BTC is now up ~15% year-to-date and sits ~13% below its record close from earlier this month. ETH is now up ~16% year-to-date and is ~20% below its record close from August 2025. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price fell to its lowest level in over three months this week. BTC is now up ~15% year-to-date and sits ~13% below its record close from earlier this month. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price dropped further this week, hitting its lowest level in over two months. ETH is now up ~16% year-to-date and is ~20% below its record close from August 2025. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. A logarithmic scale is used on the y-axis of this chart to better illustrate the relative percentage changes and long-term growth of these cryptocurrencies, as opposed to their absolute price fluctuations. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

With over 21,000 investors joining in and the price rising every single hour , smart money is flooding in, especially from Ethereum whales seeking a hedge and diversification play in a volatile market. The presale is nearing its final stage, and only early buyers can still claim a 50% bonus with the code PATRIOTS100X before it sells out. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale: Price Rising Hourly, No Dips, Massive FOMO MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered rare territory — a presale that rises every hour and shows no dips in momentum. The demand has been explosive, with thousands of new wallets joining daily. The project’s safe infrastructure, verified audits, and community-first model have made it one of the most trusted presales in 2025. As traders search for the best crypto presale with real traction, MAGACOIN’s growth curve continues to outpace earlier hits like PEPE. What’s different this time is with real DeFi utility , creating a token that’s fun but functional. With the final presale phase approaching, the bonus offer (PATRIOTS100X) gives early participants 50% extra tokens , but only for a short time. Once this round closes, prices are expected to list higher on both CEX and DEX exchanges , which have reportedly begun discussions with the project team. Every minute counts now — MAGACOIN’s hourly price ticks upward, making timing crucial for those who want to maximize entry before listings go live. The project’s pace suggests it could be the best altcoin to buy before 2025’s next bull run begins. Ethereum Whales Move Early — Seeking the Best Crypto Presale for Safety and Hedge Ethereum’s long-term holders have begun positioning early into MAGACOIN FINANCE, a move that many see as a signal of where smart capital is rotating. After recent market corrections across major assets like Bitcoin and XRP, institutional-sized wallets are now chasing new presale opportunities that offer both safety and growth. Ethereum remains one of the most established assets in crypto, but even large holders are diversifying into younger altcoins that combine meme energy with real DeFi use cases. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out — offering audit-backed security, transparent tokenomics, and a community-owned foundation. In times of uncertainty, whales prefer projects that show legitimacy and reliability. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers just that: Fully audited (HashEx completed, CertiK ongoing) KYC-verified team No tax on trades Clear, transparent tokenomics For many high-net-worth investors, this is the best crypto presale to buy now for both hedge and early upside , especially as the token trades under $0.0006 , a price analysts say could “cancel two zeros” in the next major rally. A Hidden Gem Under $0.0006 — New Chance After XRP and Ethereum For investors who missed Ethereum’s rise from double digits or XRP’s breakout years ago, MAGACOIN FINANCE feels like the new opportunity . It’s a hidden gem under $0.0006 , gathering serious whale attention and retail enthusiasm alike. Analysts tracking whale flows confirm growing wallet activity around the presale contract, reflecting early positioning before the final stage ends. MAGACOIN combines scarcity, safety, and smart token design , giving it a real shot at being one of the best crypto presales of this cycle. In a market full of uncertainty, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a safe haven , a project where participants can grow without constant fear of price dips or hidden risks. With its transparent setup, hourly price increase, and upcoming exchange listings, it is not just another meme coin — it’s a secure entry into the next major wave of digital assets.

53516810,611532,1761177628,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53516810.jpeg,Tether Mints Another 1B USDT – $7B in Stablecoins Issued Since The Crash,https://bitcoinist.com/tether-mints-1b-usdt-7b-in-stablecoins-issued-crash/,"Tether has just minted another 1 billion USDT, only hours ago, reigniting debate over stablecoin-driven liquidity flows across the crypto market. The mint comes at a crucial time — Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim higher levels after weeks of volatility, while altcoins continue to bleed as if a full-blown bear market were underway. These mints tend to inject liquidity into exchanges, providing the capital needed for traders and market makers to re-enter positions or stabilize volatile price swings. While not always an immediate bullish catalyst, they frequently precede recoveries in market sentiment and volume. The latest mint follows a wave of renewed uncertainty across the crypto landscape, with investors closely watching Bitcoin’s $110K level as a make-or-break support zone. Altcoins, meanwhile, are experiencing double-digit declines, raising concerns that risk appetite remains weak. If history is any indication, this new influx of stablecoin liquidity could be setting the stage for a short-term rebound — or at least a temporary relief rally — as liquidity begins to circulate across major exchanges and derivative markets in the days ahead. A Liquidity Wave That Could Shake the Market According to data from Lookonchain, Tether and Circle have collectively minted over $7 billion in stablecoins since the October 10 market crash. This surge in new supply marks one of the most significant liquidity injections since midyear, sparking speculation about its potential impact on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Stablecoin mints on this scale often act as precursors to major price swings. While not a direct form of buying, they indicate that fresh capital is being positioned to enter the market — typically through market makers, institutional desks, or exchanges preparing for renewed trading activity. In this context, the $7 billion influx suggests that liquidity conditions are improving after the sharp drawdown that liquidated billions in long positions earlier this month. Related Reading: 2,496 Bitcoin Moved After Years Of Inactivity – Long-Term Holders Take Action However, such rapid capital movement can also heighten volatility. As this liquidity begins to circulate, it can amplify both sides of the market — first triggering relief rallies as buyers re-enter, and then sharp corrections as leveraged positions unwind. For Bitcoin, the timing is especially critical. With BTC still struggling to hold above $108K–$110K, this new liquidity could determine whether the next move is a bullish breakout or another leg lower. Historically, large stablecoin issuances have preceded upward shifts in Bitcoin’s price, but in a fragile market, they can also fuel speculative whipsaws. Tether’s USDT Dominance Rebounds As Traders Seek Stability Tether’s market dominance has risen sharply to around 5.06%, signaling a notable shift in sentiment as investors move capital into stablecoins amid heightened market volatility. The weekly chart shows a strong rebound from the 4.6% level, with USDT dominance now testing resistance near the 100-week moving average. This uptick coincides with the broader crypto market downturn following Bitcoin’s failure to hold key support at $110K and widespread selling across altcoins. Historically, rising USDT dominance reflects increased demand for safety — traders exiting volatile assets and parking capital in stablecoins to wait for clearer market direction. This pattern often precedes periods of accumulation, as sidelined liquidity builds up, ready to re-enter once confidence returns. From a technical standpoint, the structure suggests that a sustained breakout above 5.2% could extend the dominance rally toward 6%, a level last seen during previous market corrections. However, rejection here would imply stabilization and potential capital rotation back into risk assets.

The figure was posted on his social feed. Based on reports, that user base would represent about 6.25% of the global population. At the same time, USDT’s circulating supply is reported to be roughly $182 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Goes Big — $255M Longs Opened Before Trump–China Summit Tether Reports 500 Million Users The announcement came in a short social post from Ardoino celebrating the milestone. It’s the “biggest financial inclusion achievement” in history, he said. The company frames this as a major step for financial access, pointing to broad use in markets where traditional banking is limited. The method used to count “users” has not been made public, and the figure appears to be self-reported by Tether. Tether USDT reached officially 500 million users! Likely the biggest financial inclusion achievement in history. https://t.co/jbmnMDwidi — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) October 21, 2025 Use Patterns In Emerging Markets In several emerging economies, market participants say stablecoins are used for more than trading. They are used for cross-border payments, local transfers, and as a quick store of value when local currencies fall in value. Based on reports, people and businesses often move money into USDT to avoid volatility in their own currencies. That practical use is part of why the company emphasizes the inclusion angle. Market Size And Supply Figures USDT’s reported $182 billion supply places it among the largest stablecoins in circulation. Analysts tracking on-chain data note that a large portion of stablecoin flows still occur on major blockchains and centralized exchanges. Verification And Counting Caveats The 500 million claim has raised questions from industry observers and some analysts. How a “user” is defined is unclear: It wasn’t fully disclosed in detail if it is a unique person, a wallet address, an account on a partner platform, or an aggregate of multiple identifiers. Reports emphasize that without detailed methodology, outside verification is limited. The number should be viewed as a company figure that signals scale, but not as an independently audited headcount.

If even a portion of the 500 million are new entrants to digital finance, that would be significant. Meanwhile, regulators in several jurisdictions are watching stablecoins more closely. That scrutiny could affect how stablecoins are used in payments and remittances going forward.

Attendees included Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Senator Chuck Schumer from New York. Other industry names like Kraken co-CEO David Ripley and Uniswap Labs’ Hayden Adams were present. Nazarov said this wasn’t the usual roundtable. “It was definitely some more senior senators speaking at once,” he said. “They realize the economic value of the industry is high, so they need to address how they are going to deal with it, they need to address it correctly.” Crypto industry demands answers Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov joined a dozen leaders in a nearly three-hour sit-down and two separate meetings, first with Democrats, then with Republicans. The first session, lasting about an hour and a half, included questions from Democratic lawmakers about decentralized finance and illicit use of crypto. Schumer joined briefly. Nazarov said the tone was serious, and that lawmakers seemed focused on figuring out how to engage with the space without losing control. The second meeting ran for just over an hour and was with Republican lawmakers. According to Nazarov, they were much more direct in their support. The central topic in both rooms was the same: the market-structure legislation, which was supposed to go to markup in late October. But with the federal government in shutdown mode, nothing’s moved. The bill aims to create rules that separate commodities from securities and assign clear roles to regulators. That’s critical for companies like Kraken and Coinbase, who want to know which agencies they’ll be dealing with and what compliance looks like. Right now, that clarity doesn’t exist. “The meeting was productive, with stakeholders providing feedback and reaffirming support for a bipartisan approach,” said Jeff Naft, spokesperson for the Senate Banking Committee’s Republican side. He also pushed Democrats to commit to a markup date and stop dragging their feet. Earlier this year, both parties managed to pass a stablecoin bill, which was signed by President Donald Trump in July. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The season will go live next week on October 28, featuring new maps, weapons, and tactical modes that expand the fast-paced combined arms combat the series is famous for. Based on the recently released trailer, Blackwell Fields, a new map, has been updated and set on an extensive air base in California. The landscape features oil wells, burning fields, and vast open spaces, ideal for massive battles that involve both ground and air vehicles. The map will debut with the season’s first phase, called Rogue Ops. EA confirms that Season One will release in three phases The first phase has also featured a new 4v4 tactical mode inspired by classics like Search and Destroy and Counter-Strike. The game allows only one life per round, making it critical for gamers to make decisions carefully. For teams to secure a win, they must either eliminate the enemy or capture a single objective point. Battlefield 6 Season One has maintained squad revives, adding an extra layer of coordination and teamwork. New kits and vehicles are also part of the latest release. Gamers can expect to wield the SOR-300 Carbine, the Mini Fix sniper rifle, the GGH-22 pistol, and equip new attachments like the Rail Cover and Low-Powered Variable Optic (LPVO). The game has also introduced a new armored personnel vehicle, which will boost defense and attack abilities across large maps. EA confirmed that Season One will open in three stages, each bringing fresh content towards the end of the year. The second phase, called California Resistance, will be released on November 18, with a new map named Eastwood. The new map features a dense battlefield inspired by Southern California’s upscale neighborhoods and golf courses. Based on the trailer, Eastwood’s map layout appears different from Blackwell Field’s open expanses. Gamers have a chance to move tanks and air vehicles within the suburban homes featuring golf carts and pools. Gamers can also engage in close-quarters firefights in hotels and country clubs. The second phase will also include the new Sabotage mode, an 8v8 limited-time experience where teams alternate between attacking and defending cargo objectives. Lastly, the third stage, called the Winter Offensive, will be released on December 9, introducing a winter-themed map. The map features an ice climbing axe melee weapon and a special limited-time event named Ice Lock. Battlefield 6 has sold over 7 million copies since launch Battlefield 6 sold over seven million copies within its first week of launch, marking one of the most successful launches in EA’s shooter portfolio. The publisher has maintained strong servers and focused on refining balance and regular patches for the Battlefield 6 series. Gaming communities have shown higher expectations as Battlefield 6 continues to evolve, blending massive warfare, detailed maps, and new tactical game modes. The publisher hopes to meet such expectations and establish the game as one of the defining multiplayer experiences of the decade. Cryptopolitan uncovered that copies of the upcoming game release for PS5 had already leaked, based on Reddit posts ahead of its official launch. Based on the posts shared on Reddit, the received copy had a PEGI rating, indicating that an unnamed European retailer sold it. The Reddit user confirmed that the servers were already online ahead of the expected official start on October 10. However, gamers who obtain earlier access usually lack online features until the official release. The disclosure signaled that EA may have already opened its servers for multiplayer testing and set up for the final pre-launch. The disc copy for the PS5 edition occupies 68GB, and it is also available on Xbox Series X. For Xbox Series S, there is a smaller version occupying only 39GB. Don’t just read crypto news.

This includes jet engines and laptops. A US official and three individuals who acquired information from US authorities noted that this move is in response to China’s recent decision to impose limitations on rare earth exports. Although this is not the only option being discussed, sources have highlighted that the proposed plan aligns with US President Donald Trump’s earlier warning this month regarding the blocking of the export of important software to the country by setting up restrictions on the global shipment of products that either utilize US software or were developed with it. Trump’s limitation plan under consideration raises controversy among individuals Trump shared a social media post dated October 10 stating that he would impose an additional 100% tariff on products shipped from China to the US. This was in addition to new export controls on all essential software, which is set to take effect by November 1. However, the president did not provide further information on the situation. This announcement heightened fear among personnel of US and Chinese technology companies. To allay these fears, credible sources have reported that there’s an excellent chance they won’t even happen. Still, two sources close to the situation acknowledged that the idea of these controls suggests that the Trump administration is considering escalating its existing conflict with China. Frightened by the impact of this trade war, some officials in the US government have called on the administration to consider a softer approach . Meanwhile, considering the intense nature of the situation, reporters reached out to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the White House to request that he comment on possible software restrictions on China. “I can confirm that everything is under consideration,” he asserted. Bessent further explained that if these export restrictions on products such as software, engines, or other items are implemented, they would likely be done in collaboration with their G7 partners. Interestingly, US stock markets experienced a drastic decline after Trump’s restriction announcement went viral, but analysts confirmed that they recovered some of their losses later. According to the reports, the S&P 500 ended the day down by 0.5%, and the Nasdaq was roughly 1% lower by the end of trading. Emily Kilcrease at the Center for a New American Security weighed in on the topic of discussion. She mentioned that software is a clear area where the US can apply pressure. However, according to her, enforcing such controls would be challenging and could harm US-based businesses. “You would hope they are only making threats that they plan to follow through on,” Kilcrease added. China pledges to retaliate against the US’s proposed plans with strong measures A Chinese embassy representative did not directly respond to the specifics of the US actions under consideration, but said that China firmly opposes the US imposing unilateral long-arm jurisdiction measures. The representative also pointed out that the Asian country warned it would take strong countermeasures to protect its legitimate rights and interests if the US insists on continuing with this plan, which they called a “wrong path.” In the meantime, one source with knowledge of the situation suggested that officials in the administration may announce plans to pressure China, without actually implementing these actions. Additionally, two other sources highlighted that more focused policy alternatives are being debated. Following debates about the scope of the proposed move, a source, which wished to remain anonymous, expressed that everything one can imagine is made with US software.

While XRP continues to hold a strong position in cross-border payments, its growth curve appears to be slowing as new DeFi-focused platforms rise to prominence. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as a top crypto to buy, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional investors. Currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM’s momentum signals growing confidence in its innovative ecosystem. Mutuum Finance is redefining decentralized lending, offering real utility potential that many legacy altcoins can’t match. XRP Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) fell hard in recent market volatility, losing more than 50% and printing out a large wick to about $1.25, setting what now looks like a false breakout below an important level of support. On the daily chart, from an Elliott Wave view, XRP appears to be finishing microwave 5 of primary wave C, which could again set up for the run at heavy support to see the token fall more than 30% from today’s levels. In the last year, XRP has developed an expanding flat (ABC/3-3-5) and the $2.4 level has been consistently both resistance and support, drawing significant volume. Most importantly, XRP’s low correlation to Bitcoin (BTC) is an ideal candidate for strategic trading. Traders are testing these pivotal levels for the possibility of a rebound or breakdown, and others are checking out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gaining interest for the upcoming cycle of markets in preparation, making it the best crypto to buy now. Mutuum Finance Exceeds Expectations Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most optimistic new DeFi coins. Its usage is increasing at a more rapid pace than initially anticipated, with over 17,340 investors in the presale alone, investing over $17.75 million. These figures put Mutuum Finance as the leading investment vehicle for anyone looking for a cryptocurrency with vast long-term value potential before the next bull run, earning its place as a top crypto to buy. One of the largest milestones for Mutuum Finance’s roadmap is launching its lending and borrowing protocol , which will occur soon. Version 1 (V1) will launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and feature a number of decentralized finance products including liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the Liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be integrated fully for borrowing and lending, creating early access for users in a secure, low-interest, and fully decentralized lending system. This accomplishment not only makes Mutuum Finance’s investment highly sought after but also makes it one of the most successful new crypto coin launches with enormous long-term growth potential. Community Participation in Daily Leaderboard MUTM leaderboard provides incentives for the biggest purchases of tokens in a 24-hour window, encouraging healthy community participation. Within the last 24 hours, the largest buyers spent $7,036 and $6,619 respectively, indicating increasing activity along with investor sentiment. The day’s top buyer gets rewarded with a $500 MUTM bonus. All users need to do is make at least one trade within a 24-hour window. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the best altcoins to keep an eye on this cycle. Phase 6 presale tokens are valued at $0.035, with more than 70% sold and $17.75 million raised from 17,340 investors. Daily leaderboard activity, along with $500 MUTM prizes, shows increasing community participation and investor sentiment. With its two-lending DeFi approach and upcoming V1 lending protocol on Sepolia Testnet, MUTM balances early-stage potential with actual utility. Investors who want high-growth crypto opportunities need to act now to lock up tokens before Phase 7, making MUTM a top crypto to buy for the current cycle.

53518744,611657,1761181207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53518744.jpeg,Technical Analysis Suggests XRP’s Playbook From 2017 Could Repeat In 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/xrps-2017-playbook-reappearing/,"Crypto analyst Steph has presented an interesting comparison between XRP’s 2017 bull run and its current 2025 market structure in a post on the social media platform X. The post, which was captured with “The $XRP playbook,” noted a repetition of its early accumulation phase that preceded its massive breakout eight years ago. The technical analysis places 2017’s surge beside the altcoin’s ongoing consolidation around the $2 price level, predicting that the cryptocurrency could be entering a familiar setup for another explosive rally. XRP Might Repeat The 2017 Blueprint XRP’s price action in the past few days has been defined by the cryptocurrency looking to break past $2.5. This move comes off the back of a flash crash last week, which caused the altcoin’s price to create a strong downside wick on the daily timeframe. This downside wick, on the other hand, was a quick break to the downside amidst an its price consolidation that has been dragging on since July. Interestingly, dialing the price action many years back shows XRP has played out a similar pattern like this before. Back in 2017, the token spent months trading sideways before springing into an extraordinary vertical rally that turned it into one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies of that bull cycle. This trend, which was also noted in a technical analysis post by STEPH IS CRYPTO on X, looks at the possibility of the token repeating this rally again. The left side of Steph’s chart captures the 2017 price action vividly: a slow accumulation in early March followed by an almost parabolic ascent that pushed the price from fractions of a cent to above $3 within months. The chart highlights how the upward curvature that began around February 2017 served as the launchpad for XRP’s historic surge. By framing this as the “playbook,” Steph implies that history could be on the verge of rhyming once more. 2025 Setup: The Calm Before The Storm The right side of the chart image above shows XRP’s 2025 daily chart mirroring that 2017 accumulation curve. The token has been oscillating around mid $2 to form what looks like a rounded bottom pattern. The annotation points to November/December as the potential turning point. Steph’s projected path shows the token consolidating between $2.5 and $3 for the next few weeks before entering a strong vertical climb. The projection shows XRP breaking above $3 and then going on a climb that takes it far above its current price levels. The projection line on the chart extends toward $24. This means if the 2017-style pattern repeats, the altcoin could experience an unprecedented price appreciation that brings its new price range above $20. Steph isn’t the first analyst to look at similarities to the playbook in 2017. A similar outlook from a crypto analyst known as ChartNerd predicted a breakout to $13.5 if XRP repeats the 2017 rally.",XRP|ChartNerd|ripple|Steph|Steph is Crypto|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 01:00:07

Bulls Hold $2.38 Support As Breakout Pressure Builds,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-bounce-in-sight/,"XRP is holding firm above the $2.38 support level after a recent pullback, suggesting that bulls may still have control. As buying pressure builds, traders are watching closely for a potential breakout that could reignite bullish momentum in the coming sessions. Early Strength Fades After Hitting $2.52 Umair Crypto, in his latest market update, noted that XRP displayed initial strength after rebounding cleanly from the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The price managed to climb to around $2.52 with a solid close on the 4-hour chart, signaling renewed buyer interest and a potential shift in short-term momentum. Related Reading: XRP Price Coils Below Resistance — Bulls Prepare For Possible Upside Explosion However, that early optimism was short-lived as XRP’s upward push lost steam before even reaching the 100-day SMA. The failure to extend higher has started to reveal some underlying weakness in the chart, with bulls struggling to sustain momentum at higher levels. Umair emphasized that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) trendline now plays a crucial role in determining the next direction. A confirmed breakdown below this RSI trendline could lead to another lower low, effectively continuing the current local downtrend and reinforcing bearish sentiment in the market. For now, the situation remains uncertain. XRP must hold firmly above the $2.38 support level and maintain strength along the RSI trendline. However, a failure to do so could expose XRP to deeper downside risks in the short term. Momentum Or Pause? The Decisive Moment For XRP MakroVision Research highlighted that XRP successfully halted its steep decline within the lower Golden Pocket region, between approximately $1.40 and $1.55, and has recovered as buying pressure resurfaced. In the short term, the firm noted that XRP is now approaching a key resistance range between $2.48 and $2.65. Related Reading: XRP Charts Telling A Tale: Q4 Setup Mirrors 2017 Bullish Breakout, Time To Buy? A failure to break above this zone could lead to temporary consolidation as the market gathers momentum for its next move. On the downside, the $1.96 level remains a critical support area, as losing it could reintroduce downside pressure. From an upside perspective, a decisive and sustained breakout above $2.65 could open the door for further gains toward $3.06. According to MakroVision Research, only a move beyond this level would confirm renewed bullish strength and restore clear upward momentum across the broader trend. In conclusion, the analyst emphasized that XRP’s precise targeting of the Golden Pocket and its swift recovery show that buyers are still active and defending key zones. However, the next major test lies in whether the bulls can generate enough momentum to overcome the $2.65 resistance and set the stage for a broader rally.

The CMA stated that platforms, including Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android, were widely used by millions of businesses and consumers. Still, it noted, rules such as the ones employed in their app stores might be “limiting innovation and competition”. According to the regulator, it found that the firms’ mobile platforms, which include operating systems and browsers on both smartphones and tablets, held a position of “strategic significance” in the market, with most UK mobile device holders being either Apple or Android users. The CMA, tasked by the government to stimulate economic growth, stated that it was following the lead of the United States, certain European countries, and Japan in targeting the two tech giants. Apple and Google push back as UK regulator weighs tougher competition rules Google, however, remarked that the CMA’s upcoming actions would reveal whether it was truly fostering competition. At the same time, Apple cautioned against following the EU’s interventionist approach, which it claimed had weakened user privacy. In the UK, nearly all smartphones operate on either Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android systems, with their app stores and browsers holding dominant or exclusive positions on their respective platforms. The CMA has previously noted that this dominance allows the two tech giants to wield significant control over digital content, services, and innovation. The regulator clarified that its decision did not imply any wrongdoing or impose immediate obligations but signaled its intent to consider “proportionate, targeted interventions” to enhance competition. Google, which earlier this month became the first company to receive a Strategic Market Status (SMS) designation for its search business, described the move as “disappointing, disproportionate, and unwarranted.” “The CMA’s next steps will be crucial if the UK’s digital markets regime is to meet its promise of being pro-growth and pro-innovation,” Google’s senior competition director Oliver Bethell said in a blog post. Apple stated that it “worked tirelessly” to create the best products, services, and user experience, and noted that Britain risked undermining this effort, potentially leading to weaker privacy and security, as well as delayed access to new features. “We’ve seen the impact of regulation on Apple users in the EU, and we urge the UK not to follow the same path.” Just recently, the iPhone maker went to court in Luxembourg to launch a legal challenge against the EU’s Digital Markets Act , a forerunner to the UK’s new tech competition rules that came into force in January. The tech firm is opposed to the DMA’s changes to its App Store and how iPhones interact with wireless accessories from other manufacturers, such as headphones. The investigations arrived at a challenging time for the CMA, which is trying to implement the new digital markets laws without being perceived as overly hostile to business. Experts urge CMA to balance fair competition with investment-friendly policies According to Tom Smith, a competition lawyer at Geradin Partners and a former CMA director, the CMA could now allow app developers to operate with greater ease, enabling them to inform customers about cheaper deals. “This is something that has already been adopted in the US, so it should not be a controversial measure,” he said. Matthew Sinclair, the senior director of trade body CCIA, noted, however, that the “opaque” designation process would cause significant uncertainty for firms innovating and investing in the UK. Sinclair continued to emphasize that it is essential for the CMA to adopt a conservative approach when considering conduct requirements and respond to the clear steer from ministers to promote investment and growth.

The initiative aims to enable BNB Chain users to participate in the world’s active prediction market directly on BSC (BNB Smart Chain). BNB Chain announced that the integration with Polymarket will enable users to deposit BNB or stablecoins on BSC and begin trading instantly. The integration will also not require complex bridging or any manual transfers between BNB Chain and Polymarket. Polymarket integrates other blockchains into its platform BNB Chain 🤝 Polymarket @Polymarket now supports direct deposits from BNB Smart Chain, letting users trade on real-world events instantly with BNB or stablecoins. 🔗 https://t.co/o9b33LUHA5 More on the news 👇 pic.twitter.com/iMrhswfATx — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) October 22, 2025 Polymarket acknowledged that the initiative showed the expansion of real-world utility for BNB Chain users. The firm confirmed that the integration of the deposit function provides BNB Chain users with direct access to its diverse markets and liquidity, allowing them to participate in on-chain predictions without leaving the BNB ecosystem. The predictions platform confirmed that the launch focuses on new BNB-themed markets, including whether BNB reaches an all-time high by the end of the year, or if BNB hits $1,500 by the end of the year. Polymarket said the markets invite the community to express its views with real stakes. The firm argued that the price-based forecasts will offer live sentiment signals for the BNB ecosystem as liquidity grows. Polymarket believes that the initiative opens new ground for builders and users alike. The firm argued that the integration connects BNB users to Polymarket’s market environment, helping BNB Chain continue to grow as the center of real-world utility and innovation. The integration comes as Polymarket rolled out deposits and withdrawals via Hyperliquid on October 15. The firm stated that the initiative enables users to transfer funds between the two platforms, providing faster liquidity access for prediction market trading. Polymarket acknowledged that Hyperliquid’s high-speed infrastructure, which handles about 100,000 orders per second, complements its on-chain betting. The company also said the integration will have no bridging delays and leverages Hyperliquid’s fee structure, which avoids high Polygon or Ethereum gas fees. Earlier this month, Polymarket also enabled Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals. The initiative followed BTC’s surge to a fresh all-time high above $126,000. The predictions platform already supports deposits in a variety of tokens across Polygon, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, and Solana. On October 13, MetaMask also partnered with Polymarket to integrate the prediction market platform directly into its wallet app. Although the integration will launch later this year, it will enable MetaMask users to buy and sell shares in prediction markets directly within the self-custodial interface. MetaMask announced that the integration will be available in most regions, including the U.S., the UK, Singapore, France, Thailand, Poland, Australia, Belgium, Taiwan, and Canada. The firm believes that the initiative supercharges Polymarket’s ecosystem, with Hyperliquid boosting on-ramp speed, while MetaMask’s over 30 million monthly users drive mainstream adoption. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s digital identity project, Worldcoin, also announced its integration into Polymarket on Tuesday. World stated that its users can download and access the new Mini App in countries where the prediction platform’s services are allowed. The launch of the Mini App on World enables World App users to participate in prediction markets using two crypto assets, USDC and Worldcoin. World also said the eligibility of Worldcoin tokens is restricted based on geography, age, and other factors. Prediction markets hit a new all-time high in trading volume The integrations come as the trading volume on prediction markets surged to new all-time highs of $2 billion on Monday. According to data from Dune, Polymarket accounted for roughly 52.3% ($1 billion) of total volume, while its rival, Kalshi, recorded about 47% ($950 million). On-chain data also revealed that Kalshi has been outperforming its competitor for eight consecutive weeks. Kalshi, the first federally regulated prediction market platform in the U.S., surpassed Polymarket in trading volume for the first time in August. The prediction platform also began beta testing its U.S. app earlier this month, in preparation for reentering the U.S. market.

He posted on Truth Social that the CEOs told him the tariffs made their stocks “soar” and saved U.S. automakers from what they described as a “hard, long slog” in the market. The new 25% import duty will take effect on November 1, but it’s already making noise across the auto industry. The announcement sent traders rushing into auto stocks, with GM shares up 14% in early Tuesday trading and now sitting 24% higher for the year, nearly 35% up in the past twelve months. Trump wrote that the tariff strategy was meant to push foreign truck makers to build more in the U.S., adding that it was working faster than expected. GM raises prices and trims losses as tariffs hit profits Inside GM, the focus is on surviving the higher costs and turning the tariffs into a financial advantage. Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told Yahoo Finance that “tariffs are getting a little bit better,” and that Wall Street should understand “it’s stabilized.” He said the company started the year surrounded by tariff noise but stayed confident it could “adjust and work through it.” Jacobson said GM is relying on its “track record” of resilience, pointing out how the company made it through the pandemic and the global semiconductor shortage. He added, “Now we’re on track to be able to lean on that record and look to a 2026 that could be better than 2025.” He also said the Trump administration wants the U.S. auto industry to be successful, citing recent trade progress with South Korea and potential relief talks involving Mexico and Canada. GM now estimates tariffs will cut $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion from profits this year, less than its earlier forecast of up to $5 billion. The company expects new tariff revisions to ease the hit, with savings expected to show up by the fourth quarter. GM also said cost cuts will offset part of the damage. To keep margins steady, GM has been raising prices on its trucks and SUVs, saying it finds “opportunities to add content and create value for the consumer” each time it updates a model. Jacobson said GM is seeing “strong demand” for full-size SUVs and trucks, allowing the automaker to tweak pricing and production to keep revenue flowing despite the tariffs. The result has been a stronger performance from its most profitable vehicles, even as component costs rise. Ford faces recall wave and factory delays after plant fire While GM works to stabilize its margins, Ford has been struggling with a wave of recalls and a supply disruption that’s affecting production lines. Ford is recalling 1,448,655 vehicles due to a rearview camera problem that can cause distorted or blank images when drivers reverse. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the defect increases the risk of a crash. This follows earlier recalls of 290,000 vehicles this month over similar issues with Ford’s 360-degree camera systems in certain lighting conditions. Earlier this year, Ford also recalled 1.1 million Ford and Lincoln vehicles in May and another 200,000 in July for related camera malfunctions. The problems pile onto Ford’s production delays triggered by a three-alarm fire last month at an aluminum plant in New York, which forced the facility to shut down until early next year. The plant supplies metal for Ford’s Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, both high-margin models. The production halt has also disrupted supply chains for Jeep SUVs, which rely on the same aluminum supplier. According to an internal memo allegedly obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Ford extended the pause on assembly of the Expedition and Navigator at its Kentucky Truck Plant through October 26. Factory workers said output of the F-Series Super Duty trucks, which can sell for over $100,000 each, has also been trimmed to manage shortages. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This major accumulation wave has reignited investor curiosity and fueled talk about whether Dogecoin could deliver a 5x potential move before the year ends. While the spotlight shines on DOGE, a fresh name — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is turning heads with its HashEx-certified safety, growing community, and a limited-time 50% bonus for early adopters. Whale Moves Signal Growing Conviction Among Big Players Recent whale accumulation has stunned traders — over 120 million DOGE were purchased in a short span. This marks one of the largest Dogecoin whale accumulation phases of the year, according to blockchain data trackers. Analyst Ali Martinez posted on X : “10.50 billion $DOGE were accumulated at $0.21. That’s a big resistance zone forming. Keep this level on your radar!” Analyst Don echoed the sentiment: “The chart is telling us in the next few days, some kind of big news should come out for $DOGE.” This heavy buying came while retail traders remained cautious. Institutional wallets quietly soaked up DOGE during price dips — a pattern that has often preceded strong upside swings in past cycles. Many analysts see this as a strong indicator of confidence in the DOGE long-term forecast . Moreover, data shows that these whale addresses tend to hold for extended periods, often acting as market stabilizers during volatile conditions. If these whales continue adding to their positions, it may push DOGE toward a stronger Dogecoin market outlook heading into Q4. DOGE Price Prediction 2025 — Analysts Expect Momentum to Build The latest technical readings paint a mixed but promising picture for Dogecoin’s near-term price path. Several analysts expect the coin to regain momentum in the coming months, with some even predicting DOGE 5x potential gains. Kaleo , a well-known X trader, noted: “Dogecoin is expecting a swift reclaim of $0.25 soon. There’s A LOT of thin air to fill from the market nuke a couple weeks back.” Cantonese Cat added: “DOGE is having a hard time breaking above 0.886. It’s not ready to be incredibly bullish yet, but it’s close. Expect another challenge at 0.886 in Q4 2025.” DOGE price analysis The mix of whale accumulation and strong support around $0.21 has built a sturdy base. If DOGE can break through resistance levels, analysts believe it could easily climb to higher price zones, reviving talk of the best crypto to buy now among large-cap meme coins. DOGE price prediction 2025 models point toward a gradual rally, supported by renewed interest in meme coins and the foundation’s latest moves — including the Dogecoin Foundation’s acquisition of a controlling stake in the Italian soccer club U.S. Triestina Calcio 1918. This bold expansion has widened Dogecoin’s visibility, merging crypto enthusiasm with real-world influence. With such strategic steps and strong whale activity, Dogecoin whale activity 2025 could drive the next leg of growth as part of the top altcoins for 2025 bull run narrative.

Rather than relying on multiple indicators, he focuses on a single chart tracking short-term holder net unrealized profit and loss (NUPL), suggesting that this data alone may offer significant insight into whether XRP is at or near a market bottom. #XRP PRICE PREDICTION (EVERYTHING JUST CHANGED!) pic.twitter.com/UzV0J5vKp9 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 20, 2025 Understanding the Indicator The chart presented compares XRP’s price ( a black line) to the short-term holder NUPL ratio (a colored line). When this colored line drops into the capitulation zone—marked in red—it signifies that short-term holders are selling at a loss. According to the analyst, historically, such moments have aligned with key market bottoms. He restricts the analysis to data from October 2024 onward, underscoring one year of price action and investor behavior. In October 2024, XRP was trading around $0.50. At that time, the NUPL ratio moved into capitulation territory. While the price did not immediately reverse, those who entered during that phase reportedly saw strong gains weeks later, as XRP rose to nearly $4. This pattern, he argues, is consistent and has been repeated multiple times. Historical Examples of Capitulation and Recovery The analyst identifies March 2025 as another pivotal moment. XRP, trading below $2, dipped again into capitulation. Following this, the price advanced toward the $3 range. A similar scenario unfolded in June 2025, when XRP declined to near $2, prompting another capitulation event among short-term holders. Shortly after, the market recovered to approximately $3.40 to $3.50. These repeated instances form the basis of his case: capitulation from short-term holders has historically aligned with optimal buying zones rather than moments of further decline. Each of the cited periods exhibited temporary fear, followed by a substantial upside within a relatively short timeframe. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Current Market Position and Analyst’s Outlook Currently, the NUPL ratio has fallen to approximately -0.2, which he notes is potentially the lowest reading ever recorded for XRP under this metric. This is even deeper than the October 2024 levels, which only approached -0.1. The analyst describes this as a stronger capitulation than previous cycles, indicating heightened fear and more severe losses among recent market participants. He stresses that such conditions, while uncomfortable, have regularly marked the final phase of downward pressure. In his view, exiting at this stage would be ill-timed, as history suggests this zone precedes recovery. He urges viewers to avoid emotional decision-making and instead focus on empirical data. Final Perspective StephIsCrypto concludes that the market may be positioned at or very near a bottom based on this indicator alone. While acknowledging broader uncertainty, he maintains that deeply negative NUPL readings convey opportunity rather than risk. Although he briefly mentions available trading platforms, the core message remains centered on the chart’s implications: panic selling has historically favored those willing to take the opposite position. The analysis ultimately frames the present environment not as a signal to retreat, but as a phase warranting attention to data rather than sentiment.

This was after the tech giant shifted the standard from two-day to same-day and even one-hour delivery. Currently, Amazon aims to save precious seconds on each delivery with robots, AI, and new eyewear assistance. Amazon’s commitment to accelerating the delivery process with its advanced glasses After reports leaked that Amazon was developing advanced glasses last year, the tech company showcased the glasses for delivery workers for the first time this week. Internally known as Amelia, these glasses feature a small screen that provides turn-by-turn directions, scans package codes, and takes photos to confirm deliveries. Considering the unique features, analysts mentioned that the tech giant’s glasses might replace the big handheld GPS devices that drivers currently use. Additionally, they noted that these glasses can provide individuals with useful navigation advice, such as suggesting which way to turn when exiting an apartment elevator or even ways to avoid an aggressive dog at a client’s house. To work effectively, sources familiar with the situation pointed out that Amazon’s advanced glasses connect to a controller attached to a driver’s vest. Meanwhile, the tech company revealed its designed swappable battery packs to solve battery life challenges. This announcement was made at Amazon’s yearly “Delivering the Future” logistics event. Notably, this event aimed to enhance the “last 100 yards” of delivery, which the company highlighted as typically the most expensive part of getting packages to customers. To illustrate its dedication to accelerating the delivery process, reports from reliable sources indicate that Amazon launched a delivery van scanner last year, which made work easier for drivers. According to these reports, the van scanner enabled drivers to identify packages at each stop by shining a green light on them, thereby saving the time that drivers would otherwise waste reading labels. Apart from this innovation, the sources also noted that the tech giant presented new digital maps to reporters in June of this year. These digital maps provide more detailed information about neighborhoods, building shapes, and obstacles compared to Google Maps. Beryl Tomay acknowledges the effectiveness of Amazon’s advanced glasses Beryl Tomay, Amazon’s Vice President of Transportation, mentioned that several drivers had already tested the advanced glasses on their routes. Following their feedback on Amazon’s advanced glasses, Tomay stated that the eyeglasses reduce the need to simultaneously handle both a phone and a package. She explained that they keep the driver focused, hence improving their safety. Hence, according to her, some drivers have saved up to 30 minutes in their shifts since news of the maneuver has spread. Tomay also noted that drivers and their contracted firms will not be forced to use smart glasses. Additionally, she mentioned that the company plans to give out the smart glasses for free to those who opt to use them. However, Tomay cautioned that the glasses remain experimental and Amazon’s plans for them have not yet been finalized. To make work easier, the online store recently announced the launch of a robotic arm that it said would help warehouse workers pick items from shelves and organize them, thereby speeding up and improving the accuracy of order delivery. Amazon said the Blue Jay robot can reduce injury rates and operate in a more compact space than older robots, which typically require three separate stations. In related events, Amazon’s glasses launch coincides with Samsung’s unveiling of the Galaxy XR . The South Korean multinational manufacturing conglomerate is the latest to take on the category with the Galaxy XR. Samsung began selling it on Tuesday night for $1,800, about half the price of Apple’s Vision Pro. Those who buy the new gadget early will also receive a suite of digital freebies, including free access to the paid version of Google’s Gemini AI assistant and YouTube Premium for a year. The headset was made in collaboration with Google for the software and Qualcomm, which makes the chip powering the Galaxy XR. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Rowe Price moves into crypto with new active ETF plan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/t-rowe-price-files-for-crypto-etf/,"T. Rowe Price has filed with the SEC to launch a crypto ETF that will allow investors to invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The ETF will be an actively managed fund that aims to outperform the FTSE Crypto U.S. Listed Index. If approved, it will trade on the NYSE Arca under a ticker symbol that has yet to be announced. T. Rowe Price moves into crypto with new active ETF plan T. Rowe Price manages $1.77 trillion in assets and has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create its first Active Crypto Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The filing states that the fund will hold 5 – 15 different digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Litecoin (LTC). The company said this number may change depending on market conditions. The Active Crypto ETF will only hold “eligible assets” to stay within clear legal boundaries and comply with SEC rules, thereby avoiding the legal issues that have affected other crypto projects in recent years. The fund will also maintain a portion of its assets in cash, stablecoins, or short-term safe investments, such as bank deposits, to ensure it always has sufficient liquid funds for expenses. T. Rowe Price Sponsor LLC will manage the fund’s operations, trading decisions, and long-term strategy. At the same time, CSC Delaware Trust Company will act as the trustee to ensure that its activities comply with the rules. T. Rowe Price Associates will handle accounting, record keeping, and reporting. Another interesting point in the filing is that the fund may include staking in the future if regulators allow it. The ETF could generate additional income for investors and support the network’s operations. However, the company stated that it will only move forward once U.S. regulators provide clear guidance and rules on staking. The Active Crypto ETF will have experts as managers who will monitor price trends, market activity, and long-term growth of each coin to determine the optimal time to buy, sell, or adjust the fund’s position. Rising investor demand pushes major firms to add crypto funds Companies like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have launched Bitcoin ETFs , bringing in more than $150 billion in investments in just a few months. The SEC also approved Ethereum ETFs later in the same year, and these attracted $23 billion in assets in just a few months. T. Rowe Price is following the lead of popular financial companies like Fidelity, VanEck, and ProShares, which have also expanded into crypto investments. ProShares, for example, recently filed for its own mixed digital coin fund that will hold several cryptocurrencies instead of just one. The SEC is currently reviewing over 90 applications for different types of crypto ETFs. Some focus on single coins, such as Solana, while others, like the T. Rowe Price proposal, include multiple digital assets in a single fund. Analysts say all these applications prove just how optimistic investors are about the future of crypto regulation in the United States. T. Rowe Price did not make any comments, but this move demonstrates how much financial institutions now view crypto as a genuine investment opportunity.

Notably, stablecoin reserves on leading crypto exchanges like Binance are entering all-time high (ATH) territory, hinting at a potential rally for BTC. Stablecoin Reserves Rise – Will Bitcoin Benefit? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor PelinayPA, Binance stablecoin reserves are approaching ATH levels, indicating that investors are ready to deploy funds to accumulate BTC at current or lower levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters ‘Disbelief Phase’ – Could Short Sellers Face The Next Squeeze? The CryptoQuant analyst highlighted the rapidly falling Bitcoin-Stablecoin Ratio (ESR). For the uninitiated, the ESR measures the proportion of Bitcoin reserves to stablecoin reserves on exchanges like Binance. The ratio also gives hints about the market’s potential buying power and selling pressure. Past data shows that whenever the ESR falls sharply during market volatility, BTC’s price tends to surge. Essentially, a declining ESR means that stablecoin reserves are growing in comparison to BTC reserves on exchanges. This shows an increase in available “dry powder” on exchanges, which can quickly be used to buy more BTC and initiate another bull rally. Conversely, when the ESR rises, it means that stablecoin reserves are falling while BTC supply on exchanges is increasing. This points toward an increase in short-term selling pressure as traders deposit BTC to exchanges to sell. Currently, the ESR has fallen to historically low levels, implying that Binance holds relatively large stablecoin reserves compared to BTC reserves. According to PelinayPA, such a setup can have two interpretations: In a positive scenario, the abundance of stablecoins suggests significant latent buying power. If market confidence returns, this could trigger a strong wave of buying pressure and mark the start of a new bullish phase. Meanwhile, the negative scenario assumes that this liquidity would remain inactive, reflecting investor hesitation and a market in standby mode after the recent bloodbath that resulted in liquidations worth $19 billion. Will The Gold Rotation Help BTC? Following the crypto market crash earlier this month, which sent BTC from an ATH of more than $126,000 all the way down to $102,000, several whales faced liquidations. Despite the crash, some analysts are confident that the BTC top is not in yet. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Are Back: Three Indicators Suggest A Run Toward $130,000 One of the factors that can significantly benefit BTC in the near term is the capital rotation from gold to the digital asset. In a new report, Bitwise predicted that capital rotation from gold into BTC could propel it to $242,000. That said, veteran trader Peter Brandt recently forecasted that BTC could crash 50% from current price levels. At press time, BTC trades at $108,268, down 0.3% in the past 24 hours.

After weeks of volatile price action, the market’s recovery attempts are being met with heavy resistance, with BTC still trading below key psychological levels. According to data from Lookonchain, the well-known trader known as the BitcoinOG (1011short) — famous for shorting the market during the October 10 crash — is once again making headlines. On-chain data shows that the whale has started dumping BTC, triggering renewed anxiety among traders and investors. This move has reignited debate across the community, as many analysts consider this trader part of the so-called “smart money” cohort — entities known for anticipating market shifts with high precision. While some interpret the whale’s activity as a sign of further downside ahead, others argue that such events often mark capitulation points where the market absorbs final waves of selling before rebounding. With uncertainty rising and liquidity thin, Bitcoin’s next moves will be crucial in determining short-term sentiment. The coming days could decide whether this whale’s actions confirm another leg down — or signal the last shakeout before a broader recovery phase. Whale Activity Intensifies: The BitcoinOG Moves Millions Across Exchanges According to Lookonchain insights , the BitcoinOG (1011short) — the trader who famously shorted the market during the October 10 crash — is once again making major moves. Since the market downturn, this whale has deposited 5,252 BTC, worth approximately $587.88 million, into major exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, and Hyperliquid. At the same time, data shows his short position on Hyperliquid has grown to 2,100 BTC, valued at around $227.8 million. This scale of activity has drawn intense attention from analysts, given the trader’s historical accuracy in predicting market tops. Depositing Bitcoin to exchanges often signals potential selling or hedging behavior, adding to the bearish tone currently dominating sentiment. Combined with the expansion of his short exposure, it suggests the whale could be positioning for further downside or protecting gains from earlier market moves. However, several experts have urged caution in overinterpreting these transactions. On-chain visibility only provides a partial view — these may be just a fraction of the whale’s total holdings or broader strategy. It’s possible that some positions remain hidden across other derivatives platforms, wallets, or over-the-counter deals. This uncertainty makes the whale’s behavior both intriguing and concerning. While retail traders often react strongly to such visible movements, seasoned analysts emphasize the need for broader context — including derivatives data, funding rates, and liquidity shifts. Weekly Chart: Support Retest as Market Faces Key Inflection Point The weekly Bitcoin chart shows the market struggling to hold above the $108,000 region, a critical short-term support level that aligns closely with the 50-week moving average (blue line). After the sharp drop following the October 10 crash, BTC attempted a rebound but failed to sustain momentum above $114,000, signaling persistent selling pressure near the $117,500 resistance — a level that has acted as both support and resistance multiple times over the past year. The structure now suggests Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase within a broader bullish trend, but downside risks remain elevated. If the 50-week moving average fails to hold, the next potential support lies near $100,000, which aligns with the lower range of historical demand and the March 2025 breakout zone. A break below this region could accelerate selling momentum and confirm a deeper retracement. Conversely, reclaiming $117,500 would signal renewed strength, opening the door for a potential retest of the $125,000–$130,000 range. Overall, Bitcoin’s weekly structure remains cautiously bullish, but sustained weakness around current levels would put the broader uptrend at risk — making the coming weeks decisive for long-term direction.

The conversation began after developer Vincent Van Code suggested that Ripple’s primary objective has always been tied to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and its native token, rather than to side ventures such as stablecoins or cross-border payment products. When will everyone just accept that Ripple endgame has ALWAYS been XRPL and XRP. Not stablecoins, not cross border, just establishing a global liquidity on chain, using XRP, #TheLiquidityTokenXRP — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 20, 2025 Analysts Argue Ripple’s Strategy Relies on XRP Growth According to Van Code, the company’s broader vision is to establish global on-chain liquidity powered by the XRPL, positioning XRP as the foundation for large-scale financial transactions. His comments reignited a long-standing belief among some investors that Ripple’s business model is directly dependent on XRP’s valuation. XRP proponent Digital Asset Investor reinforced this view, stating that the company’s success is inseparable from the eventual appreciation of XRP. While Ripple has consistently avoided making public projections about the token’s price, he argued that its financial structure leaves little doubt about the importance of a stronger XRP market. Ripple’s reticence on price-related discussions is widely interpreted as a regulatory safeguard, particularly given its history of legal disputes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, the firm’s substantial XRP holdings, about 35 billion in escrow and an additional 5.01 billion readily available, clearly tie its financial health to the token’s value. At the current trading price of roughly $2.40 , every $1 increase would theoretically add around $40 billion to Ripple’s balance sheet. Community Divided Over Ripple’s Direction Despite these perspectives, not everyone within the XRP ecosystem agrees that Ripple’s strategy revolves around XRP’s price. Some critics argue that recent decisions contradict the company’s stated commitment to its own blockchain. For instance, a well-known community member, Fishy Catfish, questioned why Ripple issued nearly 90% of its RLUSD stablecoin supply on Ethereum rather than the XRPL. Data from CryptoQuant supports this observation. It shows that only 92.5 million RLUSD reside on the XRPL, while the total supply nears 900 million. The move has led some to interpret Ripple’s strategy as a vote of no confidence in its native network. “Not even Ripple wants to use XRP or XRPL,” Catfish remarked, describing the chain as outdated and underused. Meanwhile, other users maintain that XRP has always been intended as a bridge asset for cross-border liquidity solutions, a mission Ripple has championed since its inception. They question whether the company’s new initiatives signal a shift away from that original focus. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Quiet Endgame Still Centers on XRP Despite internal disagreements, market observers highlight Ripple’s continuous efforts to integrate XRP into institutional systems. Ongoing partnerships with firms such as GTreasury , Evernorth , and Japan’s SBI Holdings illustrate that the company is still expanding practical use cases for the token. In addition, Ripple is reportedly supporting initiatives to establish a major public XRP treasury , a long-term accumulation strategy designed to mirror how other firms have driven value appreciation through controlled supply growth. Although Ripple avoids explicitly connecting its success to XRP’s price movements, most analysts agree that the two remain closely aligned. As the company deepens its presence in institutional finance and continues to build liquidity infrastructure around the XRPL, community members see growing evidence that the company’s ultimate objective is inseparable from the value of XRP itself.

Bitcoin leads the rebound, joined by altcoins like XRP , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) — and MAGACOIN FINANCE , now drawing whale attention as buyers prepare for a major Q4 rally. Bitcoin Bounces Back After $19B Crash After a record $19 billion liquidation on October 10, Bitcoin’s drop to $104,000 caught many off guard. But Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick now says the shakeout may have cleared the path for a major rally. He believes Bitcoin could rise to $200,000 by year-end if ETF inflows keep growing and the U.S. Federal Reserve continues easing rates. Kendrick told Cointelegraph that even in a weaker market case, Bitcoin could close “well north of $150,000” before December ends. He added that ETF inflows are already recovering, with $477 million in net positives this week alone, signaling renewed demand from institutional players. This bounce marks what many traders see as a second accumulation phase. With gold also reaching new highs, Bitcoin is regaining its safe-haven appeal. Many analysts now list it as the best crypto to buy for November , especially for those seeking a rebound play after the crash. XRP Price Outlook Turns Up After Sharp Drop XRP’s recent price drop hit harder than most. During the October 10 flash crash, XRP fell as low as $0.77 on Binance , marking a 72% daily plunge. But some analysts now think this correction could set the stage for a strong recovery. Crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo told his 700,000 followers on X that XRP’s setup looks similar to late 2017, when a flash crash on Binance preceded its legendary run to $3.3. He believes XRP “could send from here,” noting how the coin bounced from a long-term descending trendline. XRP currently trades under $2.5 but continues to attract attention from retail buyers and whales waiting for a clean breakout. With renewed buying pressure and historic patterns aligning, many are placing XRP among the best crypto to buy for November , expecting it to mirror previous recovery cycles. Cardano Shows Signs of a 333% Rebound Cardano (ADA) remains in focus for long-term investors. Despite price drops since early October, analysts see a clear uptrend forming. Market watcher Javon Marks said ADA has kept its breakout structure intact, which could pave the way for another large rally. Marks projects a 333% rally to $2.96 , noting that ADA has consistently made higher highs and higher lows since 2023. Even its recent dip to $0.279 didn’t break key levels. Other analysts like Chris O forecast a run to as high as $5–$8 this cycle if sentiment strengthens. Cardano’s stability amid market turbulence gives it an edge for recovery portfolios. Its consistent development and committed user base make ADA one of the best crypto picks for November , especially for those diversifying beyond Bitcoin and XRP. Chainlink Positioned for Institutional Growth Chainlink (LINK) trades around $17.52 after a brief pullback, but institutional activity hints at bigger moves ahead. Grayscale and Bitwise have filed to launch Chainlink ETFs on NYSE Arca — a move that could open new channels for traditional investors to enter the asset. Whales also remain active around the $16 price zone, buying more than 54 million LINK tokens in October. This buying zone may act as a base for the next run, especially with exchange reserves falling by 33 million LINK since July. Chainlink continues to lead in real-world asset (RWA) integration, working with S&P Global, SWIFT, and ICE. Its growing relevance in decentralized data systems keeps it among the best crypto to buy for November for those seeking steady, utility-driven growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Interest Surges Before Q4 Breakout As traders rotate capital into new altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching attention. Over 21,000 new investors joined after the team confirmed listings on both a major DEX and CEX. Market watchers say whales are quietly building positions under $0.0006 , expecting what could become the biggest Q4 breakout among low-cost coins. Imagine holding before a surge to $0.1 — that’s a 1000x gain from today’s price. Many see it as a way to diversify from top caps while still capturing big upside. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE? Whale entries ahead of listings Early-stage altcoin under $0.0006 Transparent, community-driven model With buzz growing, MAGACOIN FINANCE joins Bitcoin, XRP, ADA, and LINK among the best crypto to buy for November . How Traders Can Position Now Traders are shifting from panic to preparation. The October crash created fresh entry zones for top coins. Those diversifying into upcoming names like MAGACOIN FINANCE could be early in the next breakout wave.

Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview Shiba Inu Investor Confidence Remains Strong as Wallet Count Grows The rise in holders, though modest, reflects continued confidence in Shiba Inu’s long-term prospects. On-chain analyst Etherscan_SHIB described the trend as “strong momentum,” noting that new investors continue entering the ecosystem even amid volatility. Currently, Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades near $0.00000985 with a market capitalization of about $5.86 billion, down over 47% year-over-year. Nonetheless, the community’s ability to expand during a bearish cycle underscores the meme coin’s enduring cultural and retail appeal. Exchange Inflows Raise Short-Term Concerns Despite strong community participation, short-term risks remain elevated. Data from CryptoQuant revealed that Shiba Inu exchange reserves rose by over 56.6 billion SHIB within 24 hours, suggesting increased selling intent. The movement of tokens from self-custody to exchanges typically signals short-term profit-taking or fear of further downside. Analysts also point to a descending triangle formation on SHIB’s chart, a bearish technical pattern that often precedes breakdowns. The base support around $0.00001052 has been tested multiple times since April, and a confirmed breach could push prices toward $0.000006. Nevertheless, Shiba Inu’s ability to avoid “adding another zero” to its price this week has been celebrated as a small but meaningful psychological victory for holders. Can Token Burns and Shibarium Drive the 2025 Rebound? Analysts remain divided on whether SHIB can mount a strong comeback in 2025. Optimists cite the growing Shibarium layer-2 adoption and an active token burn mechanism as potential catalysts for a long-term rebound. These mechanisms aim to reduce SHIB’s massive 589 trillion supply, which critics argue is the biggest barrier to significant price appreciation. Bullish forecasts suggest that if burns accelerate and network utility grows, SHIB could retest $0.000025–$0.00005 in a favorable 2025 market. However, others warn that sustained gains will depend on Shiba Inu delivering on its DeFi, metaverse, and NFT marketplace promises.

53523291,611625,1761188441,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53523291.jpeg,Ethereum Will Impose Gas Limit In Fusaka Upgrade,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-gas-limit-fusaka-upgrade/,"The Ethereum Foundation has confirmed that the upcoming Fusaka hard fork will introduce a protocol-level ceiling on how much gas a single transaction may consume, formally codified as EIP-7825. The cap is set at 2²⁴ gas—16,777,216 units—marking the first time Ethereum enforces a per-transaction limit distinct from the block gas limit. The change is already active on Holesky and Sepolia and will go live on mainnet when Fusaka activates . In a post published October 21, Toni Wahrstätter framed the rationale in direct terms: “Starting with the upcoming Fusaka hard fork, EIP-7825 introduces a per-transaction gas limit cap of 2²⁴ (≈ 16.78 million gas).” The Foundation’s note emphasizes that while the cap bounds individual transactions, it does not alter the block gas limit; instead, it is designed to mitigate denial-of-service vectors where a single oversized call monopolizes an entire block and to improve block packing predictability as the network prepares for parallel execution. EIP-7825 draws a clean line between transaction-level complexity and system-level throughput. Previously, exceptionally large calls could approach the full block gas target (around 45 million at times), creating timing and scheduling pathologies for builders and validators. The new ceiling obliges workloads that would exceed 16.78 million gas to be broken into smaller, sequenced calls. The Foundation’s guidance is careful to note that “for most users, nothing changes,” since the statistical distribution of real-world transactions already sits well below the threshold; the risk surface primarily concerns batch-heavy contracts, deployment scripts, and specialized routers. What This Means For Ethereum And Users From a roadmap perspective, the cap is explicitly positioned as groundwork for parallel execution. The blog post connects the change to anticipated efforts such as EIP-7928 in the “Glamsterdam” era, where predictable, bounded transactions are a prerequisite for meaningful concurrency in the execution layer. By ensuring that at least several independent transactions can be packed per block—even under pathological mempool conditions—the cap reduces worst-case contention and simplifies scheduler design for builders experimenting with parallelizable execution paths. The specification itself is spare and mechanical. EIP-7825’s abstract states the intent “to 16,777,216 (2^24) gas” per transaction, improving resilience against certain DoS vectors and making transaction processing more predictable as block limits rise. That simplicity has been part of its appeal in core-dev channels: a small, well-scoped constraint that preserves forward compatibility with more ambitious scaling work. Debate on how to encode and communicate the ceiling has been active for months, including discussions over naming and parameterization on Ethereum Magicians and during AllCoreDevs calls. One thread summarized the core guarantee being targeted by several contributors: aligning block targets to multiples of 2²⁴ so builders can always include at least n transactions if the mempool has n eligible ones—an argument for predictability rather than raw throughput. Operationally, the Foundation says all major clients —Geth, Erigon, Reth, Nethermind, and Besu—have implemented the change in Fusaka-ready releases, reducing cross-client divergence risk at activation. The post also stresses that eth_call semantics are unaffected and that pre-signed transactions whose gas limits exceed 2²⁴ will need to be re-signed below the cap. The upgrade path for developers is straightforward: test against Holesky or Sepolia, re-tool batch operations that flirt with the limit, and adjust gas-estimation logic and alerts so they fail fast when constructions exceed the new ceiling. The policy context is worth parsing. Ethereum’s history has favored minimal, general-purpose constraints, deferring complexity to higher layers. EIP-7825 fits that pattern: it does not opine on what contracts should do, only that they respect an upper bound that protects liveness and prepares the execution layer for a multi-threaded future. It also sidesteps fee-market alterations and leaves blob-space economics and block targets to other EIPs and forks. As the Foundation put it, the cap “establishes a safer and more predictable foundation for higher throughput in future forks ,” a line that sums up the trade-off succinctly. At press time, ETH traded at $3,835.",Ethereum|EIP-7825|ETH|ETH news|Ether|Ethereum Fusaka|ethereum news,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 03:00:41
53521721,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87292,1761188553,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: Ripple Could Acquire Chris Larsen’s 2.5 Billion XRP Holdings. Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-ripple-could-acquire-chris-larsens-2-5-billion-xrp-holdings-heres-why/,"A growing discussion within the XRP community has centered on the vast XRP holdings of Ripple’s co-founder and executive chairman, Chris Larsen. The speculation began after a market observer known as XRP Liquidity suggested that Ripple might eventually purchase Larsen’s remaining tokens, which amount to roughly 2.5 billion XRP. The analyst’s comments follow Evernorth’s recent initiative to create the world’s largest XRP treasury , a project that has drawn attention from several prominent institutional investors. Evernorth aims to raise $1 billion worth of XRP for this effort, marking the first large-scale treasury program of its kind. My guess is Ripple is or will be buying Larsens remaining 2.5B XRP. Expect alot more of Larsen off loading if true. Especially, if all 2.5B is off loaded. Same with Britto. At $200 XRP price Larsens 2.5B XRP would be worth 500B dollars. They will not let him have that. https://t.co/YdvbBz0q6B — XRP_Liquidity (Larsen/Britto/Escrow/ODL/RLUSD) (@XRPwallets) October 21, 2025 Evernorth’s XRP Treasury and Larsen’s Contribution Times Tabloid recently reported that the Japanese financial powerhouse SBI Holdings is among the firms backing Evernorth’s plan, having pledged $200 million. Ripple itself is expected to contribute around $300 million, while additional investors have committed a combined $645 million. As part of his personal involvement, Chris Larsen donated 50 million XRP, valued at approximately $120 million, to the initiative. The transaction, which took place on October 20 from one of his wallets identified as “chrislarsen2,” was initially mistaken by some market participants as a potential selloff. However, later clarifications confirmed that the transfer represented his contribution to Evernorth’s fundraising campaign rather than a liquidation event. Following this transaction, Larsen’s personal XRP balance stands at roughly 2.5 billion tokens. These holdings trace back to the early days of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), when he and other co-founders received large token allocations after the network’s creation more than a decade ago. Could Ripple Acquire Larsen’s Holdings? The suggestion that Ripple might purchase Larsen’s XRP stems from the company’s interest in maintaining market stability and preventing future large-scale liquidations. XRP Liquidity argued that while Larsen remains affiliated with Ripple, his personal control over billions of tokens presents a potential market imbalance that the company could eventually seek to address. Observers have compared the situation to that of Jed McCaleb, another Ripple co-founder who sold his entire XRP holdings on the open market after parting ways with the company. McCaleb’s sales, which took nearly eight years to complete, often exerted selling pressure on the asset’s price during that period. The same analyst also highlighted that Ripple might consider acquiring the XRP owned by Arthur Britto, another co-founder who remains largely out of the public eye. Data from XRPScan indicates that Britto holds about 1.3 billion XRP, currently valued at over $3 billion. In contrast, Larsen’s remaining holdings are worth around $6 billion at current prices. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Implications for Ripple and the Market Larsen’s XRP balance places him among the wealthiest individuals in the crypto space, with a net worth comparable to prominent billionaires such as Mark Cuban. The scale of his holdings has fueled speculation about what could happen if XRP’s price were to rise significantly. According to XRP Liquidity , a hypothetical scenario in which XRP reaches $200 per token would push Larsen’s wealth to an estimated $500 billion, a figure that could create serious concentration concerns within the ecosystem. The analyst suggested that Ripple may prefer to manage this by purchasing or redistributing some of those holdings, though there is no evidence that the company has such plans at this time. At present, the idea remains purely speculative. Neither Ripple nor Larsen has indicated any intention to initiate a buyback or transfer arrangement. Still, the discussion highlights the influence of large individual holders on XRP’s long-term market dynamics and the company’s ongoing efforts to balance decentralization with financial stability.

It has captured my attention with the recent announcement that they own 2.7% of ETH supply. BMNR is a speculative venture, with a steep premium between its ETH and market cap, but it also has the backing of some famous investors with deep pockets. ETH is itself a speculative vehicle, and so adding corporate leverage to it, like the 50M shares BMNR created to buy ETH with, ratchets up the risks to crypto. Corporate leverage also ratchets up the reward, as we've seen with MSTR and Bitcoin. BMNR aims to be the MSTR of Ethereum. Currently, BMNR is sitting on $1B in unrealized losses, although this may be temporary based on where Ethereum goes from here. Regular readers of mine will know that I have a fixation on cryptocurrency treasury companies, or firms that hold crypto like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), and Solana ( SOL-USD ) on their balance sheets instead of US Dollars. I've covered a few of these firms, as well as an ETF that holds the convertible bonds issued by these firms, and so little surprises me now when I see charts like today's focus, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (BMNR). The market just can't get enough of crypto treasury companies, it seems. Here's the YTD, including the massive spike in July when they made the shift from being solely a Bitcoin mining operation to an Ethereum treasury company. Data by YCharts Other shifts, such as adding famous investor Tom Lee (Fundstrat and the GRNY ETF) as chairman and the news of Peter Thiel ( PYPL and PLTR notoriety, among others) taking a 9% stake in the firm, have also supercharged its stock. Since that spike in July died down (condolences to those who bought at the top), the firm has still had significant volatility. Here's a zoomed-in look since August, essentially excluding the announcements that drove the stock. I'll map ETH against it, too, to show how the firm's price is now tied to its treasury holding. Data by YCharts Note that sometimes charts can be deceiving. Mapped like that, with two different Y-axes, the correlation is visible, but the difference in returns is obscured. Here's the normalized chart so you can see how volatile BMNR is compared to ETH. Data by YCharts The Anatomy of an ETH Treasury Company One thing to consider is that investors track how much Ethereum BMNR owns and how much it is worth. That dramatically influences their stock price, especially because most of the treasury holdings are bought with debt and stock issuance, providing inherent leverage. In BMNR's case, most of their financing has been done through share issuance, heavily diluting the pool. Six months ago (pre-treasury announcement), there were fewer than 2M shares, and now there are over 50M. Data by YCharts For the record, this kind of jump is not normal. In fact, most large corporations do the opposite and buy back shares from the market. The idea here is not to dilute shareholders out of their value, although that is what happens when new shares are issued en masse, but to generate enough cash to build an Ethereum position worth investing in after the dilution. This dynamic creates a situation where the company is valued partially on its ETH holdings and partially on its ability to continue amassing ETH. The wider this divergence, the more risk there is to investors. As of Oct. 21st (time of writing), the BMNR's treasury was worth $12.4B and its market cap was $16.5B. Here is the last month of fluctuations between the two figures: Moonfarm The timing of the buys from BMNR is important too because investors are relying on the corporate operations to provide value. This is one way they can easily and cheaply raise BMNR's value, getting good deals on ETH purchases. We can track these purchases, going back the last three months since the announcement, to see how BMNR is doing. It's also helpful to see when their USD holdings change. If they get too low, expect more share dilution or debt issuance. Moonfarm ETH's price has been falling in the last few days, and so BMNR is currently underwater on their ETH purchases. This may be temporary, and your view of that will depend on your opinions on ETH. If the price recovers, these unrealized losses will turn to unrealized gains and boost BMNR's stock price. Moonfarm Controlling Ethereum Because cryptocurrency networks are democratic machines with your votes tied to your assets, it is in the best interest of whales to stay that way and to accumulate more and more of the network so that they have an outsized effect. To this end, BMNR has been keeping tabs on how much of the ETH supply they own, which is now at 2.7% of currently issued tokens . Their goal is 5% of supply, which they call the ""Alchemy of 5%"" (0:3:18). With this power, treasury corps will increasingly have more and more say about what happens with the blockchain. BMNR believes that they are really a ""crypto infrastructure company,"" and their building out of validators for the ETH network is proof of this. It will also help them build a larger stake in ETH, as they will earn rewards for participating in the network. I can't say for certain if this strategy will bear fruit, mostly because it depends on the price of Ethereum, which is a very speculative endeavor. This is more and more true the shorter the timeframe you have, and so it stands to reason that investors should be very concerned with the risks of this plan panning out. Conclusion Ultimately, I am skeptical of folks calling BMNR the ""Strategy ( MSTR ) of Ethereum,"" but I get the comparison on some levels. Both firms have risen to the top of their respective cryptocurrencies in terms of how much they hold and have become whales in the space. This firm is very risky, and investors could easily lose their shirt on it if they buy in at the wrong time—valuation-wise, at least; see the 3000% spike and then 75% crash. I split the jump and crash into two charts to make this point: Data by YCharts Data by YCharts Investors going into this stock moving forward need to understand that this is an aggressive position, even more so than holding cryptocurrency outright. Volatility isn't always a bad thing, as shown in BMNR's outperformance of ETH itself, just like how MSTR has outperformed BTC. The corporate leverage adds risk, but also reward. That reward hinges on something that BMNR has little control of: the price of Ethereum. There are a lot of considerations, and the most important from my view is position size. Those wanting to hold this firm should deeply consider their sizing and its impact on their portfolio if ETH were to experience one of its infamous nose-dive crashes . Investors who believe ETH will outperform BTC moving forward will likely prefer BMNR to MSTR for the same reason.

Musk stayed silent on several pressing issues during the call. He did not address vehicle demand after an important federal tax credit ended last month. The Cybertruck went unmentioned. He said nothing about how tariffs on auto parts affect the business. Investors received no guidance on what to expect in the fourth quarter. The earnings themselves disappointed Wall Street, missing analyst predictions. But Musk chose to discuss his long-term plans rather than current sales figures and profit margins. “People just don’t don’t quite appreciate the degree to which this will take off, where it’s honestly, it’s going to be like a shock wave,” Musk said at the start of the call as mentioned in CNBC report. “We have millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars and, you know, we’re making a couple million a year.” div]:bg-bg-000/50 [&_pre>div]:border-0.5 [&_pre>div]:border-border-400 [&_.ignore-pre-bg>div]:bg-transparent [&_.standard-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pl-2 [&_.standard-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,ul,ol,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pr-8 [&_.progressive-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pl-2 [&_.progressive-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,ul,ol,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pr-8""> _*]:min-w-0 standard-markdown""> For many years, Elon Musk has pledged that Tesla car owners would be able to generate income by allowing their vehicles to operate as driverless taxis. Yet rival companies are making faster progress in this space. Waymo, owned by Alphabet, is broadening its paying robotaxi operations to additional cities, while Baidu’s Apollo Go service is expanding across China and beyond. Meanwhile, Tesla continues to be limited to limited-scale pilot initiatives. Robotaxi plans lag behind promises Back in July, Musk predicted Tesla would offer autonomous rides to “probably half the population of The U.S. by the end of the year.” The company still does not make or sell cars safe enough to operate without someone ready to take control. On Wednesday, Musk said Tesla plans to launch its driverless robotaxi service in Austin before the year ends. He added that the service would reach eight to 10 cities by the end of 2025, though those would have drivers on board. Finance chief Vaibhav Taneja revealed that “is still small” for FSD Supervised, Tesla’s driver-assistance system. Only 12% of users actually pay for it. Taneja did not share what customers pay on average after Tesla ran multiple promotions to boost sales. The company’s investor presentation showed FSD revenue fell below the $326 million reported a year earlier. That means FSD brought in less than 2% of total revenue this past quarter. After discussing robotaxis, Musk moved to humanoid robots. He repeated his claim that Optimus has the “potential to be the biggest product of all time.” Optimus is a two-legged robot Tesla is developing but has not released for commercial use. Musk previously said these robots could work in factories or watch children. He went further on Wednesday. “Optimus will be an incredible surgeon,” Musk said. He claimed that with Optimus and self-driving cars, “you can actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care.” Musk said Tesla would likely show off a new version called V3 in the first quarter of 2026. Pay package fight intensifies At the call’s conclusion, Musk connected robots to his compensation. Tesla introduced a new pay plan in September that could reach $1 trillion and give Musk 12% more ownership. Shareholders will vote on this plan at the annual meeting in early November. “If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?” Musk asked. “I don’t feel comfortable building that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.” He also attacked proxy advisors Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis after they told shareholders to reject his pay plan. Musk said the firms “have no freaking clue” and called them “corporate terrorists.” Neither firm responded immediately. The call did not cover anything Tesla might do soon to win back customers. Tesla’s brand ranking dropped to 25th place on the Interbrand 2025 Best Global Brands list from 12th in 2024.

As Solana reclaims center stage, a new wave of contenders is rising fast. Aster is gaining traction with its scalable DeFi ecosystem, while BullZilla ($BZIL) is turning heads as the market’s next potential 100x crypto. Together, Solana, Aster, and BullZilla are reshaping how investors view blockchain dominance in 2025, and the race is only just beginning. While Solana captures headlines with ETF momentum and Aster surges through multi-chain expansion, BullZilla is roaring ahead with one of the most explosive presales of the year. Its innovative tokenomics, 24-stage burn mechanism, and surging community growth are transforming early backers into long-term believers chasing massive gains. With unstoppable presale demand and a dynamic price structure, BullZilla is fast emerging as one of the top cryptos to join this week poised to outshine even Solana’s rally. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Explosive Presale Leading Top Cryptos to Join This Week BullZilla ($BZIL) is rewriting presale history as one of the top cryptos to join this week . Currently in Stage 7 (Bag Signal Activated, Phase C), the project has raised over $950,000, sold 31 billion tokens, and gained 3,100+ holders. The presale price stands at $0.00017907, with a +3.72% increase projected within seven days. BullZilla’s Progressive Price Engine automatically raises prices every 48 hours or after $100,000 is raised, creating constant scarcity and incentivizing early entry. Its 24-stage burn architecture and 70% APY HODL Furnace reward loyal investors who stake tokens long-term. Built on Ethereum, its security and transparency align with EEAT standards, making it a top presale. ROI Projection: $2,000 in BullZilla Today Could Explode to $54,800 A $2,000 investment at $0.00017907 secures 11.17 million $BZIL tokens. Once BullZilla lists at $0.00527, this investment would be worth $54,800, delivering an ROI of 2,843.77%. Early joiners from Stage 7C enjoy an even higher ROI of 3,014.26%, underscoring the benefits of timing. BullZilla’s scarcity mechanics, combining automatic burns, vault rewards, and staged price progression, make it a living ecosystem where each milestone strengthens token value. This presale isn’t just hype; it’s a structured pathway toward real deflationary growth. Your Last Shot: $0.00017907 BullZilla Tokens Before the Next Big Jump How to Join the BullZilla Presale Getting started with BullZilla is seamless. First, set up a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Purchase ETH through a reliable exchange like Binance or Coinbase, then transfer it to your wallet. Visit the official BullZilla presale site, connect your wallet, and swap ETH for $BZIL tokens. Your purchase will lock automatically, and tokens can be claimed after the presale concludes. Vesting and claim timelines are visible directly on the presale dashboard for complete transparency. Solana: ETF Approval and Ecosystem Expansion Fuel Momentum Solana remains a titan in smart contract innovation, proving its resilience even amid a volatile market. As Bitcoin stumbled below $108,000 with ETF outflows crossing $1.2 billion, Solana quietly achieved a milestone: Hong Kong launched the world’s first Solana ETF under ChinaAMC (HK). This event positioned Solana as the second major blockchain to achieve spot ETF status, boosting credibility among institutions. Despite a temporary 7% dip to $184, Solana’s fundamentals remain solid. Its ecosystem thrives with Uniswap adding SOL trading pairs, Gemini launching a Solana Card offering 6.77% auto-staking rewards, and Jito Foundation securing $50 million from a16z. Even with a 19% drop in DEX volume, Solana’s $11.06 billion TVL and leadership in daily DApp revenue confirm its dominance as one of the most efficient Layer-1 chains in the market. Aster: Multi-Chain Innovation Gains Institutional Confidence Aster ($ASTER) has become the quiet disruptor in 2025’s blockchain conversation. The token rose 4.98% to $1.21 with trading volume surpassing $643 million in just 24 hours. Its cross-chain interoperability model, linking Ethereum, Polkadot, and other major ecosystems, has drawn heavy developer migration from legacy networks. Institutional players are also paying attention. The Aster Foundation’s sustainability initiatives and enterprise-grade partnerships are positioning it as a stable long-term play. The network’s expansion across DeFi and gaming continues to generate consistent revenue, creating a steady demand curve. Analysts forecast that Aster could outperform several mid-cap rivals as it scales its validator network. For investors looking beyond volatility, Aster provides the perfect balance between innovation and institutional trust, making it one of the best cryptos to buy this week for sustained growth. Conclusion: Solana and Aster Show Strength, but BullZilla Defines Opportunity Solana and Aster exemplify how blockchain maturity drives steady growth, yet BullZilla proves that innovation plus timing creates exponential potential. Only BullZilla’s presale among the top cryptos to join this week offers investors a quantifiable path to multi-fold returns within a structured ecosystem. As presale stages shift every 48 hours or once $100,000 is raised, early participation remains the key to unlocking maximum upside. With community expansion, Ethereum-backed stability, and a transparent roadmap, BullZilla is shaping up to lead the next bull cycle, not just as a meme coin, but as a statement of financial evolution.

The Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio is an on-chain indicator that measures the ratio between BTC’s market cap and transaction volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Newbie Whales Now Sitting On $6.9 Billion In Losses, Most Since 2023 When the value of this metric is high, it means the value of the network (as represented by the market cap) is high compared to its ability to transact coins (the volume). Such a trend can be a sign that the asset may be overvalued. On the other hand, the indicator having a low value can imply the cryptocurrency’s price could have room to grow as its market cap isn’t inflated against its transaction volume. In the context of the current discussion, a modified form of the NVT Ratio called the NVT Golden Cross is the indicator of interest. This metric is a Bollinger-band-like signaling indicator that compares the short-term trend of the NVT Ratio (10-day moving average) against its long-term trend (30-day MA) to determine whether the indicator is near a top or bottom. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the Bitcoin NVT Ratio over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day EMA Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross currently has a value of around zero, which suggests the market is in a neutral phase according to the NVT Ratio. In the chart, the quant has highlighted the zones where tops and bottoms have historically tended to occur. It would appear that a highly positive value generally signals some sort of top for BTC, while a negative one can lead to a bottom. Related Reading: Chainlink To $100? Analyst Says This Breakout Could Be The Trigger In the current cycle so far, the indicator hasn’t seen any spike into the red zone. Whether this means that this bull market is an exception, or that Bitcoin is yet to reach its top, only remains to be seen. While Bitcoin market conditions are neutral from the perspective of the NVT Golden Cross, CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index is painting a different picture. As the analytics firm’s community analyst has noted in an X post, this indicator, which combines the data of several key on-chain metrics, is flashing a bear signal for the asset. BTC Price Bitcoin surged toward $114,000 on Tuesday, but it would appear that the recovery was only short-lived as the coin is already back at $108,000.

They filed a formal notice of appeal on Monday and are expected to file the full appeal papers soon. Diddy: Legal Outcome And Sentence According to court filings and public records, a jury convicted Combs on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution , while clearing him on two other charges, sex trafficking and racketeering. Judge Arun Subramanian imposed a 50-month prison term, a $500,000 fine, and five years of probation. At sentencing, the judge said a substantial term was needed so that abuse of women “is met with real accountability.” Combs had asked for a 14-month sentence so time already spent in custody would lead to a quick release. Prosecutors had pushed for more than 11 years. At the hearing, Combs told the judge, “My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick.” He said he got “lost in excess” and asked for mercy while apologizing to two women who testified against him. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs has filed a notice of appeal in his federal criminal case following his conviction and sentencing in New York. The legal move indicates he is challenging the court… https://t.co/kztoafXP5A #Diddy #LegalNews #FederalCourt — TC (@tc0888) October 21, 2025 Jury Findings And Trial Details Reports have disclosed that Combs was arrested in September 2024. His trial ran for nearly two-months this summer and drew widespread coverage. Witnesses described encounters that prosecutors said showed Combs used his influence in the music industry to pressure people into sexual situations. One witness, Cassandra Ventura, said she was physically abused and coerced into encounters described in court as “hotel nights.” Another witness who testified under the name Jane said she felt pressured even when she was unwell. The jury’s split verdict — guilty on the transportation counts but not guilty on sex trafficking and racketeering — leaves open legal and factual fights that the defense is likely to press on appeal. Jail Proximity And Public Interest Another angle that attracted attention was Combs’s placement at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he was housed in the same unit as Sam Bankman-Fried, the former crypto executive convicted in the FTX case. Sources say the two men shared dormitory-style housing and had some informal interactions. There is no public evidence linking Combs to the financial crimes at the center of Bankman-Fried’s conviction, and officials have not tied the two cases together. Tech And Crypto Connections Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs has taken part in several tech and crypto-adjacent moves in recent years. He was listed among investors in the banking app ECO, which raised roughly $26 million. He joined a funding round for a hologram and virtual-communications company that was about $12 million. Disclosure documents from June 2023 tied funds linked to Combs to a stake in X Corp. A celebrity-linked “DIDDY” meme token briefly reached a market cap near $180 million during news cycles, though links between Combs and that token remain unclear.

BTC could rise further if there is a clear move above the $109,500 barrier. Bitcoin started a fresh recovery wave above the $108,000 resistance level. The price is trading below $109,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $108,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it trades above the $109,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Takes Hit Bitcoin price declined again below the $109,500 level. BTC tested the $106,750 zone and is currently consolidating losses . A low was formed at $106,717 before the price recovered some losses. There was a move above the $107,500 and $108,000 levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $114,000 swing high to the $106,717 low. However, the bulls are now facing many hurdles. Bitcoin is now trading below $109,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $108,800 level. There is also a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $108,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The first key resistance is near the $109,500 level. The next resistance could be $110,500 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $114,000 swing high to the $106,717 low. A close above the $110,500 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $111,500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $112,000 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $113,500. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $109,500 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support is near the $107,200 level. The first major support is near the $106,750 level. The next support is now near the $105,800 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $105,000 support in the near term.

Many investors believe the SEC will resume its ETF reviews once the government shutdown is over. This renewed focus on regulation is boosting confidence and prompting traders to start positioning themselves for the next potential rally. Ethereum and Solana have been classified as the best crypto to buy before the next bull cycle . Both projects are experiencing high momentum with technological upgrades and increased institutional interest. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been identified among the standout projects gaining momentum and with growth potential due to its consistent growth and distinct model. XRP ETF Momentum Sparks Market Rotation The renewed market energy is because of the ongoing XRP ETF discussions. Several ETF decisions were suspended by the SEC when the government shut down. Analysts are anticipating prompt actions when the operations resume. The XRP ETF approvals may hasten the next stage in regulated crypto investment. Polymarket data shows a 99% probability that XRP ETF would be approved ahead of the next market cycle. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas referred to the delay as a minor pause, while Nate Geraci pointed to the growing institutional demand for crypto exposure. On October 22, Ripple, Coinbase, and several U.S. Senators participated in a key policy roundtable that could play a pivotal role in shaping ETF regulations for digital assets. The growing excitement over the ETF has sparked renewed interest in major altcoins. As market liquidity picks up, investors looking for huge gains are shifting their attention towards Ethereum and Solana. Ethereum Strengthens Ahead of Next Bull Cycle Ethereum is in its final testing phase of the Fusaka upgrade, which aims to achieve faster transactions and lower fees. This update is based on the Pectra fork and it focuses on scalability, security, and improved gas efficiency. Fusaka has been activated to the Sepolia and Holesky networks, and the last Hoodi testnet is planned for October 28. This upgrade has a gas limit of 16.78 million units per transaction to enhance reliability. The mainnet launch is scheduled for December 3 and may reinforce the role of Ethereum in decentralized finance. The lower fees will increase DeFi activity and restore confidence in long-term investors. Analysts describe Ethereum as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy before the next bull cycle because of its clear roadmap and expanding ecosystem. Solana ETF Approval Boosts Global Confidence The approval of the first spot Solana ETF in Hong Kong has generated a new buzz among international investors. On October 27, the ChinaAMC Solana ETF will list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and offer trading in HKD, CNY, and USD. The ETF has an annual management fee of 0.99% and offers secure exposure to Solana’s performance. The ChinaAMC ETF focuses on eliminating the need to operate with the tokens directly. The framework makes OSL Digital Securities the sub-custodian. This scheme meets the high requirements of Hongkong digital-asset and enables institutions to adopt it. This development strengthens the growth trend of Solana. Its growing ecosystem and speed make it one of the best crypto to buy before the next bull cycle MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as a Top Growth Pick The approval of the first spot Solana ETF in Hong Kong has generated a new buzz among international investors.

53524736,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=842889,1761194765,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53524736.jpeg,"South Korea maintains its interest rate at 2.5%, a decision some economists expected",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/south-korea-holds-the-interest-rate-at-2-5/,"Policymakers at South Korea’s central bank decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 2.5% on Thursday. The rate decision comes on the heels of new property restrictions in Seoul aimed at limiting debt growth. According to South Korean press reports on Oct. 15, the government expanded tougher property rules, including loan restrictions, to all 25 Seoul districts and 12 additional parts of Gyeonggi Province. Household debt remains a pressing issue for the Bank of Korea, which has avoided cutting interest rates to prevent a rebound in housing demand. Bank of America recognised that housing inflation is still a major focus in South Korea Economists polled by Reuters had widely expected the decision. The central bank has maintained a 3.5% rate for 1 year and 7 months before making four quarter-point cuts, two late last year and two earlier this year. It has now held rates steady for the third consecutive meeting , following similar moves in July and August. So far, analysts view the decision as aimed at cooling housing market sentiment, with Seoul’s property prices still firm even after the government’s June 27 measures restricting home loans to 600 million won, roughly $418,070. Speaking before the National Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee on the 20th, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong stated, “From the Bank of Korea’s perspective, we aim not to play a role in fueling the real estate market by further increasing liquidity.” Around the same time, Bank of America analysts noted that Seoul’s housing inflation has remained a key focus for policymakers, acting as a major obstacle to additional rate cuts in the second half of 2025. The analysts asserted that housing prices in central Seoul rose around mid-September, despite earlier government efforts to rein in the market. Although they argued that the current measures are likely to reduce housing transactions gradually, it is unclear to what extent they can stabilize prices. South Korea is still finalizing the trade deal details with Washington. South Korea’s rate announcement also comes at a time of uncertainty in its trade relations with the U.S., as both governments struggle to conclude talks on a July 30 agreement. As part of the accord, South Korea is expected to invest $350 billion in the U.S.. However, President Lee Jae Myung warned in an interview that transferring it all at once could destabilize the economy. According to reports, negotiators plan to visit Washington this week to finalize details before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in South Korea on October 31. Kim Yong-beom, Seoul’s chief policy advisor, says talks have “moved beyond most issues,” though a few sticking points still need attention. Kim revealed this after returning from Washington, where he held meetings with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and senior economic officials. According to Kim, both sides now anticipate “real progress” before their presidents meet on the sidelines of the summit. The optimism came after months of gridlock. President Donald Trump had earlier said that Washington agreed to cut import tariffs on South Korean goods to 15%, provided that Seoul commits to $350 billion in U.S. investments. The announcement, made on July 30, marked a significant thaw in relations between the two economies. Still, auto tariffs remain in place as the two sides continue to haggle over how the investment will be structured and implemented. A South Korean delegation, headed by Kim Yong-beom, as well as the industry minister, Kim Jung-kwan, the finance minister, Koo Yun-cheol, and the trade minister, Yeo Han-koo, arrived in Washington last week to finalize details of the $350 billion pledge. As previously reported by Cryptopollitan, most of this will be in loans and guarantees rather than direct capital outflows, aiming to minimize the impact on foreign exchange markets, according to Seoul. Trump, meanwhile, had said that the payment would be made “upfront.” During its most recent meeting in August, the Bank of Korea revised its 2025 inflation estimate upward to 2% from 1.9%, and its growth projection to 0.9% from 0.8%. The BOK also anticipates a modest upturn in domestic demand, driven by additional fiscal spending and improving household sentiment. However, the bank warned that exports will probably maintain favorable trends for a while before slowing due to the expanding impact of U.S. tariffs. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Related Reading: The XRP Shockwave Will Hit When No One’s Watching—Analyst The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have agreed to legalize crypto settlements for international trade, allowing Russian exporters and importers to transact in Bitcoin and other digital assets. This follows an experimental legal regime introduced in September, which tested crypto use for cross-border settlements. BTC's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Russia Moves to Legalize Crypto for International Trade Under the new Russian policy, all crypto transactions for foreign trade will be processed through regulated channels supervised by the Central Bank, ensuring strict AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know-Your-Customer) compliance. The framework maintains Russia’s domestic crypto payment ban to protect the ruble but opens the door for Bitcoin- and stablecoin-based trade with partners in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. Officials describe the reform as a “strategic necessity” that shields the economy from global financial isolation while promoting alternative trade routes. Bitcoin Authorized for Trade as Dedollarization Accelerates In a landmark development, Russia’s Ministry of Finance has authorized Bitcoin for foreign trade, marking one of the biggest policy reversals since the 2021 crypto ban. The move aligns with the Kremlin’s dedollarization agenda and leverages Russia’s massive energy reserves to support Bitcoin mining and liquidity. With over 2,395 BTC recently transferred by SpaceX’s corporate wallets sparking renewed market debate about corporate adoption, Moscow’s decision shows how state actors are now embracing the same asset once dismissed as “too volatile.” Analysts say Russia’s new framework may push BRICS nations like China and India to expand their own blockchain-based settlement systems, especially as global trade shifts away from dollar dependence. Bitcoin (BTC) rose past $108,500 following the announcement, with traders viewing Russia’s entry into crypto-backed commerce as validation of Bitcoin’s role as a neutral global reserve asset. Legal Integration and Global Implications Beyond trade, Russian lawmakers are also fast-tracking a Family Code amendment to classify cryptocurrency as marital property, a step toward full legal recognition of digital assets. The draft bill, sponsored by State Duma member Igor Antropenko, seeks to close loopholes that allow hidden crypto wealth during divorce proceedings, signaling how deeply digital assets are being woven into Russian law. If fully implemented, Russia’s crypto framework could reshape the geopolitical balance of finance. It offers a blueprint for sanctioned or developing economies to bypass Western-controlled systems like SWIFT.

ChinaAMC To List First Solana Spot ETF In Hong Kong As reported by the Hong Kong Economic Times, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has approved the first Solana spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Hong Kong. A spot ETF is an investment vehicle that allows investors to gain exposure to an underlying asset without having to directly own it. In the case of a cryptocurrency like SOL, this means that traders can invest without having to hold actual tokens on the blockchain. Hong Kong approved spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum in April 2024. The BTC products followed three months after they were approved in the US by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but the Chinese city led the way with ETH products. The same dynamic appears to be playing out again. With the US government currently facing a shutdown that has frozen SEC operations, Hong Kong’s SFC has beaten the American regulator to approving a Solana spot ETF. The spot ETF, issued by Chinese asset management company ChinaAMC, is set to launch on October 27th. It will be available in three trading lots: HKD, RMB, and USD. Each is equivalent to 100 tokens of the cryptocurrency. ChinaAMC previously launched Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs on the Hong Kong stock exchange as part of the initial wave of approvals granted by the SFC in April 2024. Over in the US, several SOL ETF filings are waiting to be processed , but with the current government shutdown, it’s unclear when they will finally be reviewed. Other altcoins like Dogecoin and XRP have also seen their filings similarly delayed. Speaking of the US spot ETFs, Bitcoin funds witnessed a notable amount of inflows on Tuesday, as data from SoSoValue shows. In total, the Bitcoin spot ETFs captured net inflows of about $477 million, breaking the trend of outflows from the last week. Ethereum funds also saw the incoming of capital, but their inflows of $141 million weren’t as significant as those of BTC products. As mentioned before, spot ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to a cryptocurrency’s price movements without directly having to own tokens on the blockchain. For traditional traders unfamiliar with digital asset exchanges and wallets, this quality can make these vehicles a convenient entry point into the asset. Bitcoin and Ethereum funds were able to tap into a new market in this way, and the same could potentially happen with Solana. That said, it only remains to be seen how demand for SOL spot ETFs will end up looking. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is trading around $186, down 8% over the last week.",Solana|hong kong|SOL|solana|Solana Hong Kong ETF|Solana Spot ETF|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|ETH|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 05:00:44

Rowe Price Files for First Active XRP ETF Holding,https://timestabloid.com/1-68-trillion-t-rowe-price-files-for-first-active-xrp-etf-holding/,"A recent update shared by crypto commentator JackTheRippler has shifted attention to a new filing from investment giant T. Rowe Price with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the document shown, the firm submitted a Form S-1 registration statement on October 22, 2025, for a proposed “T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF.” The filing indicates the ETF would be sponsored by T. Rowe Price Sponsor LLC and appear under the Securities Act of 1933. The development is being discussed within the crypto sector as a notable instance of a major traditional finance player taking a formal regulatory step toward digital asset exposure, reportedly including XRP among its holdings. Community Reaction and Market Interpretation In the hours following the report, several users on X commented on the significance of the filing. One observer highlighted that traditional finance institutions increasingly appear to be entering the digital asset space, calling it a quiet but steady shift of capital and attention. Another described the move as a pivotal moment for institutional engagement with XRP, suggesting it could represent the beginning of more direct participation from large-scale asset managers. The general tone across these reactions centered on the expectation that a regulated, actively managed ETF backed by a firm of T. Rowe Price’s stature could signal expanding recognition of digital assets within established investment frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Understanding the Filing’s Implications The filing of a Form S-1 marks the preliminary stage of the registration process for an exchange-traded fund. It signals intent, but has not yet been approved to operate or list the product on an exchange. Details such as the ETF’s exact composition, weighing of assets, and management strategy are expected to become clearer in subsequent filings or amendments. The appearance of XRP in connection with the proposed ETF remains based on community interpretation of the report shared by JackTheRippler and other commentators, as the SEC has not yet published the full filing contents for public inspection. Institutional Implication If the filing proceeds as described, T. Rowe Price would become one of the most prominent global asset managers to register an active cryptocurrency ETF with exposure to XRP . The firm’s $1.68 trillion in assets under management underscores the scale of potential market impact should the fund advance through regulatory review and receive listing approval. Whether this marks a single initiative or part of a wider institutional trend will depend on additional disclosures and the SEC’s response to the registration.

Momentum remains weak, with the RSI at 27 indicating oversold conditions, but no reversal has occurred yet. The MACD stays negative, confirming bearish bias.

The Alligator lines remain in a downtrend, showing no confirmed reversal, but repeated tests near $0.0198 hint at base-building.

The price is struggling to clear $2.50 and might decline if it trades below the $2.320 support. XRP price is moving lower from the $2.550 zone. The price is now trading below $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $2.320 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.450 resistance. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price formed a base above $2.250 and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price surpassed the $2.40 and $2.420 resistance levels. The bulls were able to push the price above $2.50. However, the bears remained active near the $2.550 level. A high was formed at $2.5520 and the price recently corrected some gains. It dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.190 swing low to the $2.5520 high. Besides, there was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $2.320 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.420 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.50 level, above which the price could rise and test $2.550. A clear move above the $2.550 resistance might send the price toward the $2.580 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.720. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.420 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.320 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.190 swing low to the $2.5520 high. The next major support is near the $2.2750 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.2750 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.220. The next major support sits near the $2.20 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

There has been no September jobs report, any key inflation data, or initial jobless claims for weeks. Additionally, the Fed has lost access to key private jobs data from ADP, covering 20% of private workers, reported the WSJ and Kobeissi Letter. “The Fed must lean even more dovish as the government shutdown continues, and they must cut rates,” it said before adding: “In fact, odds of a 50 basis point rate cut by year-end are surging.” Impact On Crypto The Fed will continue to cut rates aggressively in the wake of the data blackout and stagflation for one simple reason: “they are afraid of being ‘too late’.” CME futures markets currently predict a 96.7% probability of a 25 basis point rate cut at the FOMC meeting on October 29. The likelihood of a further 0.25% cut in December has also surged to 96.5% and the odds of a third cut in January are almost 60%. When the Fed cuts rates , traditional safe investments like savings accounts, Treasury bonds, and money market funds offer lower returns. This makes riskier assets like crypto more attractive by comparison, as Investors seeking higher yields are more likely to allocate capital to crypto when they’re earning minimal interest elsewhere. Rate cuts also make borrowing cheaper, which puts more money into circulation throughout the financial system, increasing liquidity. “Many traders look back at positive Q4 performance, anticipating repetition, so they buy, and the price goes up,” said analyst ‘cryptobirb’ before adding: “All in all, the recent [leverage flush] crisis shouldn’t cancel year-end run.” “The government shutdown has halted the drain of the TGA (Treasury General Account) and No RRP (Reverse Repo Facility) to drain [which means] less liquidity (temporarily) [leading to] sloppy crypto as the pointy end of the liquidity spear,” said economist Raoul Pal, who added, “This too shall pass.” The government shutdown has halted the drain of the TGA + No RRP to drain > Less liquidity (temporarily) > sloppy crypto as the pointy end of the liquidity spear. This too shall pass.. If you don’t understand best ask @grok or the Raoulbot on @RealVision for my views https://t.co/AXsQMVgz7l — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) October 23, 2025 The Senate failed to advance the House-passed funding bill that would end the government shutdown for the 12th time on Wednesday, which means the stalemate will continue. Markets Begin to Consolidate Crypto markets have not moved much over the past 24 hours, with total capitalization at $3.75 trillion. Bitcoin has traded in a tight range around the key $108,000 support-turned-resistance level and has struggled to break above it.

BTC dropped to $108,600, down by 14% from its highest point this year. This article explores some of the top reasons why the BTC price may drop further in the near term. Bitcoin price is about to form a death cross The daily timeframe chart shows that the coin has been in a strong bearish downtrend in the past few months. It has plunged from the year-to-date high of $126,300 to the current $108,600. A closer look shows that it is about to form a death cross pattern as the spread between the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages (EMA) has continued to narrow in the past few days. This is a sign that the coin is about to form a death cross, which often leads to more downside. Bitcoin price has also formed a double-top pattern at $124,375 and a neckline at $108,357, its lowest level in June. This double-top pattern’s depth is about 12.2%. Measuring the same distance from the neckline goves it a target of $95,000, which coincides with the extreme oversold level of the Murrey Math Lines tool. Bitcoin price is also in the process of forming a bearish pennant pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle pattern. Bitcoin price chart | Source: TradingView BTC price has formed a rising wedge and divergence The other main reason why the Bitcoin price may crash further is that numerous bearish patterns have formed on the weekly chart. Bitcoin has formed a rising wedge pattern, which happens when there are two rising and converging trendlines. The two lines are about to converge, which may lead to a strong bearish breakout. At the same time, top oscillators show that the coin has more downside as it has formed a bearish divergence pattern. The True Strength Index (TSI) has continued moving downwards as Bitcoin has jumped. Other oscillators have also continued forming a bearish divergence pattern. This includes popular indicators like the Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). These patterns point to more downside in the near term. The price target is established by first measuring the distance of the widest part and then the same one from the breakout point. This distance is about 48%, meaning that the coin may crash below $60,000 in the coming months. BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Crypto Fear and Greed Index is falling The other key catalyst for the Bitcoin price crash is that there is a sense of fear happening in the crypto industry. Data shows that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has tumbled to the fear zone of 28. It has been in a major downtrend after peaking at the greed zone of 63 in May this year. Crypto Fear and Greed Index chart | Source: CMC The CNN Money Fear and Greed Index has moved to the fear zone of 26. Further downside will have it move to the extreme fear zone of 25. Most of the gauges, including the stock price breadth, put and call options, safe haven demand, and junk bond demand have all moved to the extreme fear zone. This fear explains why investors have been reluctant to invest in Bitcoin ETFs. These funds had a net outflow of $1.28 billion last week. While they have gained $335 million so far this week, they have remained lower than their historical standards. Bitcoin price may also continue falling as US inflation remains at an elevated level. Higher inflation may prevent the Fed from cutting rates aggressively.

The move marks T. Rowe Price’s first foray into the crypto fund space and a notable shift for a company that manages $1.8 trillion in assets. T. Rowe Price Crypto ETF Comes as a Surprise Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, described the move as a “semi-shock,” underscoring its unexpected yet impactful entry. “Did not expect it but I get it.

Besides, this is a rare kind of proposal for new multi-coin products, he added. “It’s a surprise to see them as a relatively late entrant, but they’re planning to offer something differentiated to try and break into the space,” he told Reuters. Crypto Fund to Hold 15 Digital Assets: S-1 Prospectus Reveals Per the SEC filing, the multi-crypto ETF would track prices of 15 digital assets, including Bitcoin , Ethereum , XRP , Solana , Cardano , Litecoin and more. The fund may invest in other eligible assets not mentioned, the S1 prospectus read. “Under normal circumstances, the Fund is expected to hold between five and fifteen crypto assets; however, the Fund may hold more or less at any time.” T. Rowe Price joins a growing list of asset managers looking to list ETFs based on crypto and altcoins. Per Eric Balchunas, there are 155 crypto ETF filings tracking 35 different digital assets so far. “Could easily end up seeing over 200 hit mkt in next 12 months,” he wrote.

Despite the subdued macro backdrop, HTX achieved solid growth across trading volume, user acquisition, listing innovation, brand activity, and security, marking another standout quarter for the exchange. Steadily Growing Trading Volume, Assets, and Organic Traffic In the third quarter of 2025, HTX’s total trading volume rose by 25% quarter-over-quarter, while new registrations grew by 13%, expanding the platform’s user base to new highs. Total user assets on HTX reached $6.87 billion, up 6.4% from the previous quarter, solidifying the platform’s position as the world’s leading exchange. Traffic metrics also reflected the platform’s rising influence, with total impressions up 7% to 13 million, page views up 37% to 46 million, and unique visitors up 43% to 19 million. The continued growth in organic traffic underscores HTX’s expanding global reach and user engagement. High-Quality New Assets Become Wealth Boosters and Quarterly $HTX Burn Hits New High Q3 also marked a breakthrough for new listings. HTX introduced 39 quality projects, including initial listings such as TREE , CAMP , WLFI , HOLO , LINEA , AVNT , ASTER , 0G , XPL , and FF . Many of these generated outsized returns for early participants. AVNT, ASTER, 0G, and XPL all presented a near doubling of investments. ASTER , featuring an innovative “no-MEV, low-slippage” model, surged by 400% after listing, becoming the quarter’s top performer. AVNT , a standout Base ecosystem token, delivered a threefold increase, while WLFI , a DeFi project backed by the Trump family, captured broad market attention. HTX’s steady stream of promising assets further reinforced its reputation as a launchpad for new opportunities and a premier destination for early-stage token listings. On the tokenomics front, HTX DAO officially announced the completion of its Q3 $HTX burn on October 14, a total of 13,119,801,941,748 $HTX, worth over $27.03 million. This burn, up 11.19% quarter-over-quarter, sets a new record since the launch of the burn mechanism. Cumulatively, HTX DAO has now burnt approximately 85.88 trillion $HTX tokens, valued at $163 million. These ongoing deflationary measures continue to optimize token circulation and strengthen $HTX’s long-term value foundation. Meanwhile, HTX DAO is expanding its global developer ecosystem, focusing on CeFi–DeFi integration, RWA innovation, and other on-chain $HTX applications, empowering builders with resources, exposure, and sustainable growth opportunities. Marketing Campaigns and Branding for Greater Global Influence HTX maintained strong marketing momentum throughout Q3 with a series of high-engagement events, covering stablecoin trading, Ethereum’s 10th anniversary, the TRON brand, and trending assets like SOL, TRUMP, USD1, and WLFI. These events attracted over 100,000 registered participants and airdropped tens of billions of $HTX, enhancing platform activity and amplifying its global brand visibility. In terms of brand exposure, HTX continued to expand both online and offline reach. At GM Vietnam, more than 1,300 users registered onsite, setting a strong tone for the quarter. During TOKEN2049 Singapore and the afterparty, HTX DAO and HTX Ventures achieved a combined brand reach of 254 million impressions, over 3,100 clients, and 800 industry professionals with the 12th-anniversary “Flame” element leaving a lasting impression. Meanwhile, Justin Sun attended the afterparty and awarded the top 3 performers at the Miss HTX Finals. Product Upgrades and Forward-Looking Research From a product standpoint, HTX introduced key product upgrades to enhance security and experience. Accounts now support YubiKeys, providing enhanced account protection. Spot trading received a comprehensive overhaul, while Collateral Swap 2.0 went live, offering multi-asset collateral and interest-free borrowing to support users’ diversified asset management needs. HTX Ventures and HTX Research continued to publish influential insights throughout the quarter. HTX Ventures released a string of reports, including “Are Tokenized Stocks A Treat or A Trap?” , analyzing the emerging stock tokenization, regulatory trends, and institutional coordination for in-depth reading of the RWA sector. HTX Research published its flagship reports “The New Stablecoin Order: Restructuring Global Payments, Regulatory Legitimization, and the Capital War (Part I)” and “The New Order of Stablecoins (Part II): Exploring Stablecoin Public Blockchains — From Settlement Layer Reconstruction to Next-Generation Design Paradigms” , dissecting stablecoin payment reconstruction, regulatory progress, and blockchain-native settlement models. The reports have since become widely cited across the industry. Additionally, the midyear report “H1 2025 Key Industry Highlights: DAT Becomes the Standard, Perpetual DEX Aggregators Surge, Stablecoin Channels Dominate, and More” provided a comprehensive review of sectoral trends, highlighting TRON and HTX as key drivers in the evolving stablecoin and new asset markets. Further Strengthening Security and Premium Service with the Anti-Scam Official Channel Security remains at the heart of HTX’s operations, proven by great risk management efforts and multi-layer security building.

He expects Bitcoin to stay between $100,000 and $125,000 unless new catalysts emerge. Meanwhile, optimism is rising elsewhere as Japan’s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, introduced a major stimulus package that could boost Bitcoin demand through increased liquidity. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes called the move a sign of more money printing and predicted it could eventually drive Bitcoin to $1 million. 250K Bitcoin Is Unrealistic Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz poured some cold water on the popular prediction that Bitcoin will hit $250,000 by the end of the year. He did this by saying that such a move would require extraordinary circumstances. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Novogratz said that with just over two months left in 2025, it would take “a heck of a lot of crazy stuff” for Bitcoin to gain the kind of momentum needed to more than double its current price. At press time, Bitcoin was trading around $108,56. This means it would need to surge roughly 130+% in just ten weeks to reach the ambitious target. Mike Novogratz’s CNBC interview Novogratz believes that a more realistic outcome is for Bitcoin to trade within a range rather than experience another parabolic rally before the year’s end. He said that, in a worst-case scenario, Bitcoin should hold around $100,000, which is a key psychological level it first broke in December 2024 after Donald Trump’s reelection as US president. That price point was nearly tested earlier this month after Trump announced sweeping 100% tariffs on China, which sent Bitcoin tumbling to about $102,000. On the upside, Novogratz said Bitcoin would need to break past $125,000, its previous all-time high, to regain bullish momentum. He also said that the market is likely to stay “rangy between $100,000 and $120,000 or $125,000” unless new catalysts emerge. BTC’s price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) According to Novogratz, potential triggers that could propel Bitcoin higher include Trump attempting to influence the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions or the passage of the long-awaited CLARITY Act, or a crypto market structure bill that could provide regulatory clarity for digital assets. The crypto community is also closely watching the Federal Reserve, with a 96.7% probability of another rate cut at the upcoming Oct. 29 meeting, according to CME’s Fed Watch Tool. Bitcoin analyst PlanC argues that focusing too much on short-term price targets misses the point. “Anyone who thinks Bitcoin has to peak in Q4 of this year does not understand statistics or probability,” he said, and suggested that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory matters far more than where it ends the year. Japan’s Stimulus Sparks Bitcoin Optimism Others are a lot more optimistic about BTC’s capabilities. Japan’s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, unveiled a sweeping economic stimulus package that is aimed at easing the burden of inflation on households, a move that some crypto observers believe could channel more capital into Bitcoin. The stimulus plan includes subsidies for electricity and gas bills, as well as regional grants designed to help small and medium-sized businesses raise wages and maintain operations amid rising costs. While the program is intended to offer relief to struggling households, critics argue it could also trigger another round of monetary expansion by Japan’s central bank, which has historically been bullish for Bitcoin. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes was among the first people to weigh in by calling the move a prelude to further fiat money printing by the Bank of Japan. “Translation: let’s print money to hand out to folks to help with food and energy costs,” Hayes wrote on X, and predicted that such a policy could push Bitcoin’s price as high as $1 million while also strengthening the Japanese yen in the short term. His comments came as the yen slipped to a one-week low after Takaichi’s appointment as Japan’s first female prime minister. Many investors see her “pro-stimulus” stance as a potential precursor to a pivot by the Bank of Japan toward quantitative easing, a policy of buying bonds and injecting liquidity into the economy to stimulate growth. Although the Bank of Japan is still in a phase of quantitative tightening, with no official plan to return to QE until inflation stabilizes at 2%, analysts suggest that Takaichi’s policies could accelerate an eventual shift. The central bank’s next policy meeting on Oct. 29 is expected to shed some more light on its direction, though most forecasts anticipate a 0.75% interest rate hike by early 2026. Meanwhile, large Bitcoin holders appear to be growing increasingly bullish. After Bitcoin’s dip to a four-month low of $104,000 last week, several “whales” have returned to the market. According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain , three major wallets deposited tens of millions of dollars onto the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid this week to open leveraged long positions. One of them, identified as “0x3fce,” expanded its Bitcoin position to $49.7 million, while another, “0x89AB,” opened a 6x leveraged long worth $14 million. The renewed whale activity suggests that there is rising confidence that Japan’s stimulus measures could act as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s next major rally.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-23 05:30:00

The Tesla CEO told investors during third-quarter earnings call event that he wanted to “make a point of clarification,” saying both chipmakers will handle the next batch of AI5 production. Tesla depends on these AI chips to power its self-driving software and the Optimus robots it’s still developing.Musk said the company uses the chips alongside Nvidia’s hardware, which leads the market for AI computing processors. Samsung, meanwhile, is chasing TSMC’s dominance in the foundry industry, where chips are made for outside clients. It’s already building a major semiconductor hub near Austin, Texas, not far from Tesla’s own base. Samsung signs $16.5 billion deal and joins Tesla’s AI push Back in July, Elon confirmed that Samsung would also make Tesla’s AI6 chip, the next generation after the AI5. That followed a Cryptopolitan report about a $16.5 billion deal between the two companies, which gave Samsung’s foundry division one of its largest outside orders. Elon had said then that Samsung was already handling the older AI4 chip, while TSMC was responsible for the AI5. The update now means both companies will be producing Tesla’s current AI hardware, splitting the workload across two supply chains. Samsung may still trail TSMC, but this deal gives it a visible foothold in one of the most high-profile chip programs in the world. For Tesla, it means less reliance on a single supplier and more production capacity as the company ramps up development for its autonomous driving software and humanoid robots. Elon didn’t reveal how the chip work will be divided, only saying both partners are “focused initially on AI5.” But the call wasn’t just about chips. Musk completely skipped any update on EV demand, especially after the federal tax credit expired last month. There was no mention of Cybertruck, and he didn’t touch tariffs or fourth-quarter guidance either, which is pretty unusual.. Elon outlines robotaxi rollout and teases new Optimus robot Instead of talking about cars or profits, Elon went straight to his comfort zone; robotaxis and robots. He told investors that the company’s self-driving plans are about to “take off like a shock wave.” Elon claimed Tesla already has “millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars,” adding that Tesla is “making a couple million a year.” He said robotaxi service will begin in Austin by the end of this year, running without human drivers. By late 2025, the service should expand to eight to ten cities, though early versions will still keep drivers on board. Tesla’s Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja added that adoption of FSD Supervised, the company’s partially automated system, remains “small,” with just 12% of users paying for it. He didn’t disclose pricing, only saying Tesla ran several promotions to boost signups. After discussing robotaxis, Elon turned to the Optimus humanoid robot, saying it could become “the biggest product of all time.” The robot isn’t on the market yet, but he described new capabilities, saying “Optimus will be an incredible surgeon.” Elon said that with both Optimus and self-driving tech, “you can actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care.” He also said Tesla would demo a new version called Optimus V3 in the first quarter of 2026, promising significant upgrades from the current prototype. The call ended with him returning to the robot topic over and over again, tying it to his controversial $1 trillion pay package. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

At the time of writing, ZEC is priced at $240, with a 24-hour trading volume of $730 million. Meanwhile, the token is down slightly in the past 24 hours but remains up over 460% over the past month (CoinGecko data). The 24-hour price range shows a high of $308 and a low of $237, indicating high intraday volatility following a sharp rally. Wedge Pattern Approaches Resistance Current chart patterns show ZEC forming an ascending wedge. This structure often appears during strong rallies and typically signals a point where momentum begins to narrow. The price is now approaching a resistance zone between $280 and $313, marked by Murrey Math levels. These levels are often referenced by traders during periods of overextension. Movement into this zone has slowed. If volume increases, the price may test this resistance again. If not, the market may start to turn back toward lower support levels. The closest zones of support on the chart appear at $250 and $220. Source: TradingView In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached 69, close to the typical overbought mark of 70. The 14-day RSI moving average is now at 70, which suggests momentum has stretched. So far, the RSI has not broken above the overbought level. However, staying near these levels may lead to sideways trading as participants wait for a new direction. A short pullback is also a common reaction when RSI hovers at these highs. Multi-Year Breakout Meets Initial Target ZEC recently completed a major technical breakout. According to analyst Javon Marks, the token ended a downtrend that lasted over a year and a half. After the breakout, the price moved quickly toward $308, which matched a key target. Marks stated , “Another >1,000% callout in the books.” A second target has been placed near $596.65, though this remains above current levels. The move followed a period of low resistance and accelerating buying volume. The price has not yet shown any extended correction, though activity near $308 may lead to consolidation. Futures Interest and Mixed Market Sentiment According to Coinglass, open interest in ZEC futures reached $306.3 million, rising from under $50 million in September. This sharp increase reflects a surge in speculative participation. Such growth often coincides with higher volatility and larger position sizes. Source: Coinglass Market sentiment remains split. Analyst Henry wrote , “ZEC looks cooked. $311 wick was the exit liquidity.” He also added that failure to hold above $300 could lead to moves toward the mid-$240 range. He referenced a possible head and shoulders pattern forming, while noting that bulls would need to act quickly to change momentum. As CryptoPotato posted on X, Zcash founder Zooko responded to recent price speculation by saying, “I don’t know why the Zcash price has been skyrocketing. And I don’t know if it is going to go back down.” He also dismissed suggestions of coordinated market manipulation, calling them “ just more cynical propaganda .” The post ZEC Hits $308 Then Dumps Hard: What’s Next for This Breakout? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Zcash (ZEC) Price,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|ZEC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-23 05:35:33

The figure marks a dramatic jump from just four months back when the company was worth far less. The company’s value has climbed fast this year. Back in June, Polymarket secured $200 million from investors led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund. At that time, the startup was valued at $1 billion. Then earlier this month, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., which runs the New York Stock Exchange, announced plans to put up to $2 billion into Polymarket. That deal priced the company at around $8 billion before counting the new money coming in. The transaction also made Shayne Coplan, Polymarket’s chief executive, the youngest person to become a billionaire through building their own business. Kalshi valuation race heats up Meanwhile, Kalshi, which competes directly with Polymarket, is getting offers from investors who want in at valuations above $10 billion. According to Bloomberg, that would be more than twice what the company was worth in a funding deal announced just weeks ago. The rapid rise in these valuations shows how much excitement there is around this young industry where betting and finance are coming together. Both Polymarket and Kalshi have seen betting activity jump recently as reported by Cryptopolitan . During the week that ended October 19, total trading hit more than $2 billion across both platforms. That beat the earlier record set during last year’s presidential election. Wall Street giants rush to partner with prediction markets Big financial firms and gambling companies are paying attention. They’re making deals with these prediction market leaders, betting the newcomers might reshape their businesses. On Wednesday, Coplan said Polymarket would serve as a clearinghouse for DraftKings Inc. as that company enters prediction markets. The same day, the National Hockey League announced multi-year agreements with both Kalshi and Polymarket , making it the first big American sports league to partner with these platforms. Still, prediction markets face unclear rules ahead. While federal regulators have let Kalshi open new markets, state gambling officials have fought back in court. Questions about market manipulation and insider trading also remain unresolved.

A survey of 50 economists showed that most of them think the BOJ will wait till December to change its rates. Only 10% of economists think the Bank of Japan will raise rates on October 30, down from 36% before. Takaichi’s leadership makes the BOJ more cautious about raising rates Sanae Takaichi won the leadership race of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and became Japan’s new Prime Minister . Experts say the BOJ won’t rush to make any changes to its interest rates because the new Prime Minister has consistently supported keeping rates low, allowing more money to flow into the economy. She did not specify when or how the central bank should react. Still, people expect that she prefers stability over sudden financial tightening, given her popular views and long-standing political history. Before Takaichi came to office, people thought the BOJ would raise interest rates in October, but now they expect it to wait until December or even next year. Economists say the bank will cooperate with the government to avoid any disagreements, as the Prime Minister favors long-term support for growth through low borrowing costs. Senior economist at Sompo Institute Plus, Masato Koike, said, “Takaichi is probably thinking a rate hike is undesirable even after she’s softened her tone.” Experts say policymakers at the BOJ will tread carefully because they don’t want the public and investors to think the bank is going against the wishes of the government. Cooperation between the bank and the government will ensure that investors remain confident and that the country’s economic status remains stable. According to a new survey, 72% of economists said that the chances of the BOJ raising its interest rates in October have decreased significantly, largely due to the political change. More than half of the survey respondents stated that the bank could harm its relationship and cooperation with the new government if it were to increase interest rates now. Analysts say that the central bank will be very careful in how it communicates to the public, so that markets don’t misunderstand its goals and avoid spreading confusion among investors. Before Takaichi, many economists predicted that the central bank would issue an interest rate of about 1.25%, but that figure has now dropped to 1%. The market can already feel her influence in the way experts talk about Japan’s monetary policy, and many people say her leadership will have a great influence on how and when the BOJ acts in the months ahead. BOJ struggles to control yen weakness while calming market doubts The BOJ is facing a weak yen, a volatile market, and a new government under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Masamichi Adachi, Chief Japan economist at UBS Securities and a former Bank of Japan official, said the BOJ should raise its rates. He explained that the bank needs to show the public that it is serious about moving away from years of the same low interest rates. However, making a move right now could cause unexpected changes in the yen and bond markets, as people have very low expectations of an interest rate spike. Adachi said the bank doesn’t want to surprise investors because the market isn’t well prepared for such changes, and so it will most likely postpone its new rates. All eyes are currently on the BOJ as it plans to announce its quarterly economic outlook and policy decision next week. Many experts believe the bank will not make significant changes to its economic and inflation forecast from the previous report. They believe the central bank will only make a minor upward adjustment to indicate some improvement in exports and business investments, but inflation statistics will remain unchanged. Senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management, Katsutoshi Inadome, said the central bank should maintain steady interest rates for now, while still sounding confident about the chances of a future hike. He explained that the BOJ will prevent the yen from weakening too much before its next rate hike if it conveys a hawkish hold in its report. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

53526010,https://cryptonews.com/?p=442300,1761198547,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53526010.jpeg,"Crypto Lost 1,000 Jobs To AI Since ChatGPT Debut, Yet Hiring Recovered: A16z",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-jobs-lost-to-ai-since-chatgpt-debut-yet-hiring-recovered-a16z/,"Crypto’s workforce took an early hit from the artificial intelligence boom, but has since rebounded, according to Andreessen Horowitz’s State of Crypto 2025 report released Wednesday. The firm found that around 1,000 jobs have shifted from crypto companies to AI startups since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, but an equivalent number of professionals have joined the industry from other sectors. The report analyzed job movements from Nov. 2022 to Sept. 2025 and showed that crypto has lost workers to AI startups, which continue to attract technical talent. However, the sector has replenished its ranks with new hires from technology, finance, consulting and education. Roughly 12,000 people moved into or out of crypto roles during that period, suggesting a dynamic and fluid job market. AI Lured Builders Away, But Crypto Recovered Hiring Momentum From Other Industries A16z said crypto gained about 1,000 net jobs from other industries even as AI pulled away a similar number of employees. The largest inflows came from tech firms, which contributed over 12,000 professionals, followed by finance and consulting with around 6,000. Smaller inflows came from education and other sectors. The shift shows the increasingly intertwined relationship between crypto and AI. Since ChatGPT’s debut, AI has drawn both capital and talent across the tech landscape. Many developers have pivoted to AI projects, while others have found new opportunities in crypto’s resurgent markets. ChatGPT’s arrival in Nov. 2022 coincided with one of crypto’s darkest periods, marked by the collapse of FTX and a sharp contraction in venture funding. At the time, job losses, declining token prices, and regulatory uncertainty shook the industry’s confidence. AI Consolidates Power While Crypto Continues To Champion Decentralization: A16z Today, the landscape looks very different. The global crypto market capitalization has surpassed US$4 trillion, with Bitcoin reaching new record highs this year. The rebound comes amid a friendlier regulatory tone from the Trump administration, which has supported legislation for stablecoins and digital asset oversight. Institutional adoption is also deepening as firms such as JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Fidelity expand their crypto offerings. A16z’s analysis shows that much of the new hiring in crypto now comes from professionals with finance and fintech backgrounds, reflecting the sector’s gradual convergence with traditional financial systems. The firm noted that crypto’s talent pipeline is diversifying beyond developers, with growing demand for compliance, infrastructure, and product specialists. At the same time, AI’s growth has raised questions about centralization and market concentration. The report said OpenAI and Anthropic control 88% of all revenue from AI-native companies, while Amazon, Microsoft, and Google hold 63% of the cloud infrastructure market. NVIDIA continues to dominate hardware with a 94% share of data center GPUs. This concentration, A16z noted, contrasts sharply with the decentralized ethos of crypto. Crypto Standards Are Evolving To Let AI Agents Transact And Access Data Without Intermediaries Blockchains, the firm said, could serve as a counterweight to AI’s centralizing forces by powering open networks, verifiable compute, and transparent data systems. Emerging crypto standards such as x402 aim to support autonomous AI agents, enabling them to perform microtransactions and access APIs without intermediaries — a market Gartner expects could reach $30 trillion by 2030. Meanwhile, A16z identified stablecoins as one of the strongest signals of crypto’s maturity. The report found that stablecoins processed about $9 trillion in the past 12 months, an 87% jump from a year earlier. That figure represents more than half of Visa’s annual payments volume and more than five times PayPal’s. The report said that although AI drew away some of crypto’s early talent, the industry’s rebound and growing presence among major institutions point to a clear return of confidence.

Two Whales Have Accumulated Over 1.4 Million Links in Recent Months According to the data, the whale with the address 0xf386 withdrew 62,207 LINK (approximately $1.07 million) from the OKX exchange approximately five hours ago. With this latest transaction, the amount of LINK accumulated by that address over the past five months has reached approximately 1.1 million units (approximately $19 million). Similarly, another whale with the address 0xe8aa withdrew 66,113 LINK (approximately $1.14 million) from the Kraken exchange 14 hours ago. This address's total LINK haul over the past month brings the total amount to 307,684 LINK (approximately $5.34 million). The accumulation of LINK by large investors in recent weeks, according to on-chain data, suggests a renewed surge in institutional interest. Chainlink's efforts, particularly in the integration of DeFi and real-world assets (RWA), support long-term confidence in the project. According to experts, this accumulation process demonstrates that LINK has strong fundamental value despite market-wide volatility. Increased whale buying could contribute to price stability and usher in a potential future uptrend. Finally, the Chainlink ecosystem has been keeping investor interest alive recently with developments in both staking programs and data oracle solutions. *This is not investment advice.

Related Reading: Fetch.AI CEO Offers Reward To ‘Uncover’ Ocean Protocol’s Alleged $120M FET Dump Spot Market Sees Strong Q3 Performance On Wednesday, crypto exchange MEXC published its Q3 2025 Ecosystem & Growth Report, highlighting sustained expansion, robust user activity, and security from the previous quarter. According to the report, the exchange experienced strong activity and trading momentum during the market run between July and September, with over 680 new tokens added to the crypto exchange in Q3, representing a 17% increase from Q2. Moreover, the number of active users trading new listings in the exchange increased 16%, while the trading volume for these tokens surged 97%. The report also noted that the spot market had a “particularly robust” performance last quarter, with the top 10 highest-volume tokens recording an average peak gain of 2,933%, a 158% jump from Q2. Notably, memecoins, AI + Web3, Perpetual Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), and stablecoin protocols were among the dominant narratives, with tokens like STBL, Chainbase (C), and DeAgentAI (AIA) showing remarkable 500% to 12,00% performances. Meanwhile, the BSC ecosystem outperformed all other ecosystems, taking six of the top 10 tokens by growth in the crypto exchange. The report detailed that BSC projects produced an average return of over 9,000%, including TALE, BAS, and MEAL. It’s worth noting that the BSC outperformed other networks in DEX activity earlier this month, with data showing that it recently ranked first across all chains, surpassing Ethereum and Solana on DEX daily trading and chain fees. Additionally, BSC reached a new all-time high (ATH) of 5.02 trillion gas used in a single day two weeks ago. MEXC also highlighted that BSC’s strength was matched by the Ethereum and Base ecosystems, which recorded strong performance with GAIA, ERA, and Avantis (AVNT), “representing the growing cross-chain vitality of Layer-2 and DeFi derivative protocols.” Crypto Losses Trend Slows Down The report revealed that the crypto exchange intercepted 48 fraud cases last quarter, freezing nearly $5 million in illicit funds. As part of its efforts to prevent fraud, it also restricted more than 19,000 suspicious accounts, including 17,000 collusive accounts and over 2,000 bot-trading accounts. Notably, a concerning trend that has been developing this year, which could drive theft from digital asset services to a new milestone by the end of 2025. According to Chainalysis, crypto theft this year has been “more devastating” than the entirety of 2024, with over $2.7 billion worth of funds stolen from crypto services in the first half of 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Eyes $114,000 Retest Amid Bounce, But Analyst Suggests Caution As reported by NewsBTC, hacks significantly increase at the start of Q3, driving over $100 million in losses for exchanges. Q2 showed a diminishing trend in total crypto losses, with May and June recording 40% and 56% month-on-month (MoM) declines, respectively. This trend briefly shifted in July as the total value of stolen funds surged 27.2% from the previous month. Nonetheless, recent reports show that total funds lost to crypto hacks and exploits dropped around 37% in Q3, despite the market rally and initial trend.

53526539,612032,1761199233,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Ethereum Market Outlook: $4,100 Resistance Holds as BlackRock and Major Funds Boost Exposure",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-market-outlook-as-the-4100-resistance-hold/,"After two weeks of a disappointing run, Ethereum (ETH) is once again capturing institutional interest as major funds and asset managers step into the smart-contract platform. According to recent data, Bitmine Immersion Technologies purchased approximately $251 million worth of ETH, adding 63,539 tokens to its portfolio and bringing its holdings to over 3 million ETH ($13 billion). Institutional Capital Flows Bolster Ethereum’s Bullish Case BlackRock’s clients have added $41.91 million in Ethereum , marking another sign of growing institutional adoption. These inflows come as Ethereum breaks out of a descending trendline pattern and parallels the rally seen in gold, with ETH’s correlation to gold reaching 0.7 in Q3 2025, driven by ETF inflows and DeFi-driven growth. On-chain metrics further reinforce this accumulation narrative. Wallets are moving more ETH off exchanges, signaling long-term holding behavior, while tokenization and DeFi usage on Ethereum’s network continue to expand meaningfully. Institutions appear to be treating Ethereum not just as a speculative bet, but increasingly as a foundational infrastructure asset, particularly given Ethereum’s post-Proof-of-Stake upgrade energy efficiency and suitability for ESG mandates. Ethereum Holds $4,100 Resistance, Eyes on $4,440 From a technical vantage, Ethereum is testing the key resistance zone near $4,100–$4,440. Analysts like Ali Martinez point out the recent breakout of the descending trendline provides a bullish structural shift, but only if support levels remain intact. The most critical support lies near $3,800, with a deeper fallback to $3,600 if momentum fades. A sustained move above $4,440 could unlock a run toward $4,800–$5,000, provided institutional flows and macro conditions align. Conversely, a close below $3,800 would weaken the momentum thesis and potentially invite a retracement toward $3,560 or lower. With ETF flows, macro liquidity, and network fundamentals converging, Ethereum is showing a rare blend of structural strength, but execution is key. The near-term jury is out until Ethereum closes decisively above $4,100 with volume confirming the move.

Ethereum (ETH) and Chainlink are holding strong support levels, indicating renewed confidence in the market. Traders are now searching for the best altcoins to buy that show signs of an early opportunity, before the next wave of inflows starts. Market sentiment is still cautious, but analysts see increasing accumulation in a number of high-potential projects. Hyperliquid, MAGACOINFINANCE , and Avalanche are drawing attention with their solid fundamentals, steady growth, and growing participation by their communities. All of these coins are some of the best altcoins to buy before the rotation of capital picks up. Ethereum Price Analysis: Leading the Best Altcoins to Buy Ethereum Price continues to face pressure at a key support level, with traders observing for any signs of reversal. ETH was trading at nearly $3,945 at the time of writing, far below the all-time high of $4,963. The setup presents a potential upside even after this pullback as long as support holds. Source: TradingView The three-day chart displays ETH dipping from $4,963 to $3,930, but it remains bullish above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. Also, it’s above the pivot reversal level on the Murrey Math Lines tool, indicating that buyers are holding on to some key territory. ETH is currently trading close to a major swing level established during previous cycles just below $4,087, but is still holding above the Supertrend indicator. A new bullish flag formation is developing, which may break out to $5000. The bullish view would fade only if the price drops below $3,500. The fundamentals of Ethereum are still strong. The network recorded over $1 trillion in stablecoin transactions this month. Transaction volumes increased to 25.9 million, while revenue increased to $16.8 million. These figures prove that Ethereum remains one of the best altcoins to buy before the next leg higher. Chainlink (LINK) Holds Support Before Q4 Rotation Chainlink is trading in a descending channel and has bounced off the lower side of the channel around $16.60 recently. This is typically the end of a corrective phase, as buyers are starting to come back into the market. The price has been heading toward $18, with resistance levels at $20.02, $23.75, and $27.81. Source: TradinView A bullish continuation can be confirmed by a breakout above $20, and near resistance, the rejection can lead to short-term consolidation. Exchange reserves reduced by 6.18% to about $2.88 billion, which shows holders moving LINK off exchanges and reducing supply. Strong whale accumulation around $16 and long-side dominance on the futures data indicate increasing optimism. The scarcity of the supply can position Chainlink as one of the best altcoins to buy before Q4 rotation starts to accelerate. MAGACOIN FINANCE Sparks FOMO Among Early Buyers In the face of Q4 rotation expectations, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing strong attention from investors who are positioning before the next wave. Whale activity indicates initial accumulation over multiple wallets, suggesting increased conviction. Retail traders are doing the same by rushing to grab the last of the tokens before prices increase further. The tightening supply has led to clear signs of FOMO across the community, as engagement and transactions have seen a sharp increase. Analysts also suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s transparency, early-stage development, and clear roadmap towards growth make it an attractive choice for investors looking to get an early start in the next phase of the market. Those who position early may get more upside potential as liquidity and awareness build up over the rotation cycle. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Buybacks Strengthen One of the Best Altcoins to Buy Hyperliquid moves closer to a breakout as steady buyback, strong on-chain growth, and strong fundamentals keep the market’s confidence. The project has bought back more than $521 million worth of HYPE, burning 5.6% of the circulating supply. Source: Tokenomist Another $3 million was repurchased yesterday, for a total of $108 million in one month. These consistent buybacks reduce the liquidity in the market, which results in a stable price in case of corrections. The activation of HyperEVM has further added to the current optimism as the ecosystem grows. Support between $34 and $37 has continued to hold for a solid foundation for a breakout. Hyperliquid is one of the best altcoins to buy before the rally in Q4 due to its strong fundamentals and consistent demand. Avalanche (AVAX) Rebuilds Momentum Ahead of Q4 Rotation After weeks of trading sideways, Avalanche is regaining strength, backed by improving technicals and on-chain stability. Historically, AVAX has done well toward the end of the year, and that trend may repeat itself as sentiment improves. The Decentralized Autonomous Treasuries (DATs) narrative has brought a new enthusiasm to the Avalanche ecosystem. AVAX regained $20.7 and is consolidating above the Bollinger mid-band, where RSI is headed for 45. Open interest has fallen to $507 million, the lowest it’s been in three months, which indicates a cleaner market with fewer levers. This configuration raises the chances of having a sustainable uptrend. If AVAX trades above $19.7, then the next resistance levels are $26 and $28. Source: X Conclusion Ethereum and Chainlink continue to show resilience and hold strong technical points. Their ability to hold key levels is allowing the maintenance of overall market sentiment stability in anticipation of the expected Q4 rotation. Hyperliquid, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are currently attracting more capital as investors position themselves for the next phase of market growth. With the early accumulation phase and solid fundamentals, these projects are among the best altcoins to buy before Q4 inflows accelerate.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-expert-to-xrp-holders-this-is-not-real-life-heres-why/,"Levi Rietveld of Crypto Crusaders has recently shared his excitement for XRP’s future. In a new video, he discussed the latest geopolitical developments between the U.S. and China, emphasizing how these shifts could signal a reversal for digital assets such as XRP. His remarks came after President Donald Trump announced that Chinese President Xi Jinping was open to a new trade deal. Rietveld reminded viewers that only a week earlier, markets had reacted sharply to news of Trump’s plan to impose a 100% tariff on China. He noted that this move had “eviscerated” the entire crypto market and that the effects of that announcement were still visible today. Bitcoin, which had reached an all-time high of $126,000 before the sell-off, and XRP fell below $2 for the first time since June and have yet to regain their prior levels. This Is Not Real Life #XRP pic.twitter.com/8uhpocmYB1 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 20, 2025 Reversal Momentum Gaining Strength According to Rietveld, the damage from the tariff announcement remains factored into prices, but the recent softening in tone from both leaders could quickly change that. He suggested that the market has room to rebound as assets have not fully recovered. His assessment positions the current environment as one of potential recovery rather than ongoing weakness. The shift in rhetoric between the U.S. and China may restore confidence that had recently been shaken. Investors and traders who had taken a cautious stance are now closely watching for any policy progress that might validate Rietveld’s outlook. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Participation on the Horizon Rietveld also noted that “institutions are getting ready to open up and go into crypto en masse,” a statement that adds further optimism to his analysis. Institutional entry has long been a defining factor for sustained growth and legitimacy within the digital asset market. A renewed inflow of institutional capital could amplify momentum in leading cryptocurrencies such as XRP, particularly if market conditions stabilize after the recent geopolitical turbulence. Rietveld’s outlook reflects a belief that sentiment is shifting from uncertainty toward opportunity. XRP could benefit strongly from renewed investor confidence once conditions normalize. If the trade environment improves and institutional activity increases, the digital asset could kickstart the broader market rebound Rietveld anticipates.

Further caution prevailed ahead of key U.S. inflation data and next week’s Fed policy meeting. Gold prices fell to around $4,080 per ounce on Thursday, extending its decline for a third straight session amid continued selling pressure after repeatedly hitting record highs in recent weeks. Singapore's annual inflation rate edged up to 0.7% in September 2025, picking up from a more than four-year low of 0.5% in the previous month and slightly above market expectations of 0.6%. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 1.42% dropped 1.3% to below 48,700 while the broader Topix Index fell 0.6% to 3,245 on Thursday. The Japanese yen weakened past 152 per dollar on Thursday, nearing eight-month lows, amid growing speculation that new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will unveil a large-scale stimulus package as early as next month. In Japan, investors weighed the policy outlook amid speculation that new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is preparing a major stimulus package exceeding last year’s 13.9 trillion yen. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan is widely anticipated to keep rates unchanged next week, with markets now projecting the next hike in January. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.83% to below 3,890 while the Shenzhen Component dropped 1.3% to 12,830 on Thursday, marking a second straight session of losses as trade and policy uncertainties dampened sentiment, and the offshore yuan Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.25% to 25,601 on Thursday morning, down for the second day after Wall Street weakened overnight. Investors also turned cautious ahead of Hong Kong’s September inflation data due later today. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.86% to 85,196 in morning trade on Thursday, extending gains from the Muhurat ""special"" trading day on Tuesday and hitting its highest level since September 26, 2024, buoyed by renewed foreign inflows. Meanwhile, the Nifty 50 climbed above the milestone 26,000 mark for the first time since September 30, 2024. The Indian rupee traded around 87.7 per USD, holding near a one-month-high, as markets returned from a two-day break to signs of improving US–India trade ties. Indian state refiners are reviewing their Russian oil trade documents to ensure that no supplies are sourced directly from Rosneft and Lukoil, following U.S. sanctions imposed on both companies, a source with direct knowledge told Reuters on Wednesday. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.03% to around 9,000 in Thursday morning trade, extending losses from the previous session, dragged down by mining and tech stocks. The Australian dollar In the U.S. on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended lower following reports that the White House may restrict exports to China involving US software. President Donald Trump later said his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping is “scheduled,” easing some tension over US-China ties.

However, we are holding Bitcoin while shorting MicroStrategy. It was an arbitrage strategy,” Chanos said in an interview. The renowned investor argued that he found it unreasonable that shares of companies holding Bitcoin treasury were trading at a high premium compared to the value of the Bitcoin they held: “It's not rational for investors to see companies holding Bitcoin holdings generate a premium on their shares solely because of this. MicroStrategy is the most well-known example, but we believe investors who want to buy Bitcoin should buy it at $1, not $1.40.” Related News: Critical Date Set for Altcoin Project That Vitalik Buterin Invested In Chanos also noted that MicroStrategy’s premium to net asset value (NAV) ratio fell from 1.9 to 1.4, while other companies with similar structures fell below 1.0: “MicroStrategy is still holding at 1.4, but that gap will close over time.

The company’s quarterly report , released on Oct. 22, showed that it continues to hold 11,509 Bitcoin, now valued at $1.31b. The figure marks an increase from $1.23b in the previous quarter, driven entirely by Bitcoin’s price appreciation. Tesla’s holdings have not changed since early 2022, but their valuation has climbed sharply alongside the broader crypto rally this year. JUST IN: Elon Musk's Tesla did not sell any of its $1.3 billion Bitcoin in Q3 pic.twitter.com/D6GKMOXQXO — Bitcoin Archive (@BTC_Archive) October 22, 2025 Revised Accounting Lifts Tesla’s Q3 Bitcoin Valuation To Its Highest Level In Four Years Tesla began using new fair-value accounting rules earlier this year, which require its digital asset holdings to be reported at current market prices rather than at historical cost. The adjustment allowed the company to recognize the $80m gain under “other income,” its strongest quarter for Bitcoin revaluation since 2021. Its current holdings make it the 11th largest corporate Bitcoin owner in the world, ranking behind MicroStrategy, Galaxy Digital, and Block but ahead of Hut 8 Mining and other institutions. It was also Tesla’s second consecutive quarter of Bitcoin gains, reflecting the recovery in digital asset markets through 2025. Tesla Says Surge In R&D And AI Investment Drove 50% Jump In Operating Costs Bitcoin-related gains and losses are not included in Tesla’s adjusted earnings per share. The company reported total revenue of $25.18b, up from a year earlier. Automotive revenue rose 6% to $21.2b, while total net income fell 37% to $1.37b, or 39 cents per share, compared with $2.17b, or 62 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. Tesla attributed the decline in profitability to lower electric vehicle prices and higher operating costs, which rose by more than 50%. The company said the increase was partly due to investments in artificial intelligence and other research and development projects. The report signals Tesla’s continued long-term view on Bitcoin, which the company has previously described as “a liquid alternative to cash.” It has not made any new purchases since early 2022, when it briefly sold a portion of its holdings to test liquidity before reclassifying Bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset. Automaker Keeps Bitcoin Holdings Steady Despite Volatile Market Swings Since 2021 Purchase Tesla first purchased $1.5b worth of Bitcoin in Feb. 2021, a move that marked one of the earliest corporate endorsements of the cryptocurrency by a major US public company. Since then, the automaker has kept its digital asset position stable despite periods of significant market volatility. Meanwhile, a wallet linked to SpaceX, another Musk-led company, moved about $268m worth of Bitcoin to two addresses on Tuesday, according to data from Arkham Intelligence. On-chain analyst Ai Yi said the transactions followed a three-month pause and were likely part of internal fund management rather than an asset sale.

The fall for Bitcoin and Gold has been attributed to profit-taking across the market. The HYPE token sustained growth amid a broader bearish market sentiment, following the reverse merger between Sonnet Bio Therapeutics and a private entity, Rorschach I LLC, valued at $888 million, which created Hyperliquid Strategies Inc. (HSI). The newly formed company will manage a digital asset treasury, acquiring more HYPE tokens. HYPE token jumps over 7% today as Bitcoin slumps over 2% this week Based on CoinMarketCap data , Hyperliquid’s native token HYPE has climbed over 7% today, trading at $37.24, which represents a 7.25% jump over the past 24 hours at the time of publication. Bitcoin, on the other hand, slumped throughout this week with a 2.07% drop and struggles today with a positive 0.33% change, trading at $108,848.27 at the time of publication. The bearish sentiment has also caught up with Gold, which has experienced a sudden drop this week after a sustained period of bullish momentum. The metal price declined by over 5% this week and continued to drop by 0.2% today . According to a filing to the SEC on October 22, Hyperliquid Strategies Inc. will launch a digital asset treasury platform, valuing it at roughly $583 million in HYPE. The firm will raise an additional 1$ billion through an offering of 160 million new shares. A portion of the funds will be used to purchase additional HYPE tokens. Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUCoin, noted that when a digital asset treasury buys a significant amount of an asset, that’s a bullish signal as institutions tend to hold longer than retail investors, which provides stability and long-term confidence. Institutional investors have increased their exposure to DeFi projects significantly through Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, primarily driven by the search for yield and diversification. According to a recent Cryptopolitan report , BTC and ETH ETFs have continued to experience sustained outflows, which may have contributed to the current bearish sentiment surrounding these tokens. SoSoValue data shows that US BTC ETFs have shed off roughly $101.29 million as of today, while US ETH ETFs have experienced $18.77 million in outflows. Despite that, trading volumes have remained strong, suggesting that investors are reallocating funds towards more flexible alternatives. Hyperliquid Strategies’ merger boosts HYPE’s institutional appeal Hyperliquid Strategies Inc. (HSI) appeals to Hyperliquid’s perpetual futures model, which allows investors to speculate with leverage while maintaining token custody. The approach taps into centralized efficiency and blockchain transparency. HYPE has continued to receive validation from other established DeFi infrastructures. For instance, early this month, the MetaMask exchange added native support for Hyperliquid swaps, which allows users to make trades directly from their wallets, thereby expanding HYPE’s accessibility. The latest merger involving Sonnet Bio Therapeutics and Rorschach I LLC deepens the institutional validation of the ecosystem and may potentially transform Hyperliquid into a recognized institutional trading venue. Amid HYPE’s growth, BNB Chain’s Aster has lost over 40% of its value this month. Aster had maintained competition as one of the top-performing DEX tokens, offering competition to HYPE. The token peaked near $2.5 last month but has since been dropping, losing 42% of its value this month and 4.5% today alone, trading at $1. The Ethereum token has shed over 7% this month, currently trading below its September highs of over $4,000. The token was volatile, maintaining a positive 0.33% change over the past 24 hours, trading at $3,881.14 at the time of publication. The token’s market cap has also dropped below half a billion, trading at just $467 billion with a sustained daily average volume of $42.62 billion. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $7,791.89 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data.

BNB price has already touched $1000 in 2025 and buyers are holding strong to maintain the price above that level. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2026. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on futures trading expenditures with the token, which makes the Binance platform a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB, which supports the Binance ecosystem. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2027, according to the Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $7,791.89 by 2031. However, one must conduct his/her own research or seek professional financial advice.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February.

The beleaguered crypto platform recently secured approval from the Singapore High Court for its long-awaited debt restructuring plan. The exchange has spent over a year navigating restructuring and restoring user balances following the $230 million hack in July 2024. On Thursday, a company release shared with Cryptonews said that the relaunch will begin in a “phased launch approach”. It will initially start with certain crypto-to-crypto pairs and USDT/INR pair, followed by “gradual expansion” into additional markets in the coming days. WazirX founder, Nischal Shetty, announced that the funds page is live with “rebalanced tokens.” Further, the INR and crypto deposits are open. “We’re now working on withdrawals and trading.

This will apply to all trading pairs, the release noted. “At the heart of everything we do is our mission to make crypto accessible to every Indian,” said Shetty. Besides, he said that the platform is working towards the issuance of Recovery Tokens to creditors. These tokens are intended to represent each Scheme Creditor’s share of illiquid and stolen assets. This means that the tokens will be issued to creditors based on the value of their relevant claims. “WazirX is able to restart operations and initiate token distributions to creditors within 10 business days as estimated,” Shetty added. Additionally, the exchange has partnered with crypto custody firm BitGo for asset security as it restarts. “Our partnership with BitGo adds an additional layer of trust and protection with world-class custody standards, as we restart. This isn’t just a return to operations, it’s a reinforcement of our integrity, which we’ve always strived for.” The post WazirX to Resume Operations on Oct. 24, Promises Token Payouts to Creditors Within 10 Days appeared first on Cryptonews .",Bitcoin News|India|Wazirx,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-23 07:22:12

As the world’s largest lender, Beijing is now handing out favors… with strings. Countries deep in debt to China are being nudged into ditching the dollar, not by force, but through a well-timed play: offering cheaper financing in yuan, China’s own currency. That’s exactly what Ethiopia is now doing. This week, it started talks to convert part of its $5.38 billion debt into yuan-denominated loans. And Ethiopia isn’t alone. Others are already in. Kenya said earlier this month it shaved $215 million off annual debt payments after converting Chinese railway loans from dollars to yuan. “If the borrowers pay less, then the lender gets less,” said Michael Pettis, senior fellow at Carnegie Endowment. “The benefit for China in exchange for less revenue is that the renminbi becomes a more internationally-used currency.” Beijing cuts revenue to push yuan deeper into trade and debt This whole strategy, swapping dollar loans into yuan, means China is taking a loss upfront. But long-term, it lets Beijing get what it really wants: more global use of its currency. According to Bloomberg, the goal is to help countries use yuan to pay for Chinese goods, and push the currency into trade settlement and financing. The deal structure isn’t just for Africa. These conversions could soon stretch to countries across Asia, Eastern Europe, and beyond. “China’s concern is that US control of the main international currency gives it strategic leverage,” Pettis added . Basically, Beijing doesn’t want to keep playing on America’s field. This push helps it blunt Washington’s grip on global finance. China’s economic slowdown, low interest rates, and persistent deflation make its money cheaper. The U.S., still stuck with higher rates, makes the yuan more attractive to borrowers. And after Trump’s chaos tariffs, erratic policy, and record high U.S. debt, some investors just want out of the dollar. This year alone, Hungary and Kazakhstan sold yuan bonds, while Sri Lanka took a $500 million yuan loan for a highway project. Indonesia is now planning its first offshore yuan bond. As of October, over 68 billion yuan ($9.5 billion) in debt and loans had been issued, twice what was done in all of 2024, Bloomberg data shows. Zambia, another country drowning in Chinese debt, is watching closely. “Anything that reduces the debt burden of Zambia—saves money in a true sense—that is something that is of course always interesting,” said Finance Minister Situmbeko Musokotwane. No decision yet, but eyes are locked on Kenya’s deal. China expands yuan ecosystem through swaps, bonds, and fast payments Beijing’s Foreign Ministry hasn’t confirmed anything directly, but said it wants “practical cooperation” with African nations and plans to help them achieve “independent and sustainable development.” In the background, about 30 countries now have bilateral currency swap deals with China’s central bank, helping local banks access yuan more easily. “China is trying to establish an ecosystem for the yuan with more scenarios where it can be used,” said Ding Shuang, chief economist for greater China at Standard Chartered. That means more trade in yuan, more countries holding it, and more financial products priced in it. The opportunity is massive. According to Kevin Gallagher of Boston University, the world’s 78 poorest countries owe around $67 billion to China. That’s a lot of leverage. “If China refinances its debt to countries for longer terms and lower interest rates, it will give these countries much-needed fiscal space,” Gallagher said. Even with all this, results have been mixed. Capital controls and strict management of the exchange rate have limited how far the yuan can go. But China isn’t standing still. The PBOC has opened up access to its repurchase markets, launched a fast payment system with Hong Kong, and kept its currency stable even with low yields. Meanwhile, the dollar has lost 7.5% of its value this year. Its status as a safe haven is under pressure. Trump’s tariffs and the U.S. debt pile are only making things worse. And China? It’s buying gold, hedging, and slowly de-dollarizing. “China and other non-Western countries will find ways to incrementally reduce their reliance on the dollar,” said Gabriel Wildau of Teneo. “Yuan payments are becoming an increasingly viable backup option.” Beijing’s endgame is to break the current dollar monopoly and build a multi-currency world. A world where yuan has real power. PBOC Governor Pan Gongsheng wrote recently that the system could “evolve toward a structure where a few sovereign currencies coexist, compete, and counterbalance each other.” Still, not everyone’s convinced. “This interest rate configuration is unlikely to remain unchanged forever,” said Louis Kuijs, chief Asia-Pacific economist at S&P. “Other factors are needed to drive a comprehensive structural trend towards yuan internationalization, including easier access for foreigners to China’s financial markets.” Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Among the top cryptocurrencies fitting this profile are Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . XRP’s institutional backing and ETF-speculation may make it a 5- to 10-fold mover if major approvals drop. DOGE, the meme-coin OG, still boasts brand recognition and could surge with viral momentum. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out among early-stage DeFi protocols, priced at $0.035 in phase 6 of its presale which is over 70% sold out, giving it a lower entry point and theoretically higher upside. Together, these three coins present a diversified mix of stability (XRP), community-driven growth (DOGE), and early-stage speculative leverage (MUTM). Dogecoin (DOGE) Price Forecast: Bulls Having Trouble Fight at $0.20 Dogecoin (DOGE) is struggling to overcome the important $0.20 resistance level, which is equivalent to a point of former control and various earlier areas of rejection. Although it has rebounded lately, meager trading volume implies enthusiasm on the part of buyers is in short supply, leaving room for a return to $0.15, a high-time-frame area of accumulation. For DOGE to validate a continuation of the uptrend, the price must experience a daily close above $0.20 with strong volume support, which can lay the groundwork for a trip to $0.26. While traders focus on these levels, even greater interest is attracted to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), gaining increasing attention on the route to the 2025–2026 cycle and being highlighted among the top cryptocurrencies of the upcoming bull run. Ripple (XRP) Price Outlook: Recovery Gains Traction Above Important Support XRP is posting preliminary indications of a possible rebound following the rebound from the $2.50 support level. The RSI has already started to move up from oversold conditions, indicating growing buying pressure, with the MACD also starting to move in the direction of the bull, both of which indicate a possible short-term reversal of momentum. So long as XRP can remain above $2.60, it could validate a short-term bullish configuration that would set the stage for a move up towards the $3.00 resistance. But they need to be cautious since a break of the uptrend would leave the token vulnerable to bear pressures around the $2.40 support. As optimism in markets gradually sets in, investors monitoring the recovery of XRP are also watching out for high-potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) within the DeFi sector that is quickly attracting more eyes prior to 2026’s soon-to-commence large-scale market cycle, and becoming one of the best cryptos to buy now. Mutuum Finance Sets New Presale Record Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most important cryptos to invest in today. Its presale is still on an upward trajectory with more than 17,370 investors already participating with over $17.75 million. The token is currently on offer at its cheapest price of $0.035 in Stage 6 of the presale, and it is a good entry point for early adopters seeking exposure to the top cryptocurrencies before the next bull market takes off. Mutuum Finance has launched a $100,000 giveaway , to start building its community. 10 investors will receive $10,000 each in MUTM tokens. The giveaway, apart from winning new investors, shows the project is committed to doing the extra work to secure a long-term community, further strengthening its image among the best cryptos to buy now. CertiK smart contract audit has rated Mutuum Finance (MUTM) secure, and its trust rating is 90/100. The venture is offering a completely secure platform to execute DeFi transactions. The idea that has been proposed in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is to connect emerging lending capacity with the power of an ecosystem, and with a vision to shape the future of DeFi, establishing it as one of the top cryptocurrencies redefining the decentralized finance space. For high-potential crypto investors under $5, Ripple (XRP), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are a very strong triumvirate. XRP provides institutional liquidity and regulatory drivers, DOGE is based on grassroots popularity-fueled hype, and MUTM provides true DeFi innovation with a guaranteed CertiK audit and 95/100 trust score. With more than $17.75 million raised and tokens as cheap as $0.035 selling in Phase 6, Mutuum Finance offers investors an affordable entry into a secure, growth-oriented ecosystem ahead of its next presale boom. With 2026’s bull cycle imminent, these three tokens are poised to offer the kind of 10x return investors are seeking, with MUTM positioned to drive the charge for early-stage appreciation and ranked among the best cryptos to buy now for 2025.

But every single sale must now be settled in Chinese yuan, not in U.S. dollars or any other foreign currency, according to Reuters, citing two people familiar with the situation. The change comes after Beijing banned all chip exports on October 4, following the Dutch government’s takeover of Nexperia on September 30. The Dutch moved to remove Zhang Xuezheng, the company’s Chinese CEO, and took direct control of operations, citing concerns that Wingtech Technology, Nexperia’s parent in China, could siphon sensitive technology. The Dutch government claims the trigger was corporate governance issues, but U.S. pressure played a huge role, seeing as Wingtech had already landed on a restricted export list in Washington. China factory halts exports, resumes domestic trade in yuan Nexperia’s Chinese unit, which halted all shipments after the October 4 order, has now resumed supplying chips only inside China, but under strict new conditions. Distributors are being told they must settle all purchases in yuan, and are not allowed to use U.S. dollars, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. Even more, distributors have been instructed to only use yuan in downstream sales to their own customers. One of the people said the move is aimed at keeping supply inside China stable while breaking away from the Dutch parent’s control. Nexperia , which still produces its chips in the Netherlands, relies on China to package a large portion of them before distribution. But that packaging partnership may soon shift. Nexperia is now looking for other packaging firms outside China, after tensions with its own Chinese arm escalated. While the company says this plan had been in place before the dispute, people briefed on internal strategy say the search for new partners has picked up urgency. At the same time, Nexperia has warned Chinese customers that it doesn’t guarantee the quality of products sourced from its China subsidiary. According to the second person familiar with the matter, that warning was sent out quietly. A Nexperia spokesperson didn’t deny this, only stating that the company “had to inform customers of potential risks,” but stopped short of telling them to avoid buying from the Chinese unit altogether. Beijing backlash intensifies rift with Dutch parent The Chinese unit is clearly pissed. It didn’t respond directly to Reuters but later posted a public message on WeChat claiming it is “operating independently” and that manufacturing and business activities remain normal. It also accused the Dutch parent of spreading “groundless doubt” about product compliance and said it would be pursuing legal options. The suspension of exports has already shaken automakers.The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said its members were told by a Dutch chipmaker that it can’t guarantee steady deliveries, a major red flag for Japanese auto part suppliers. That could spill into production timelines globally, especially since Nexperia makes high-volume, basic chips used in nearly every vehicle. Meanwhile, the German economy ministry said it’s setting up urgent calls with automakers and suppliers to address fallout from the Nexperia situation. The Dutch economy minister has also spoken with his Chinese counterpart but admitted no resolution was reached.

TON historic price sentiment TON price by CoinGecko Ton network launched in 2018 as the Telegram Open Network (TON) but was later renamed “The Open Network” and taken over by the TON Foundation. In June 2020, all Toncoin tokens (98.55% of the total supply) became available for mining. The tokens were placed in special Giver smart contracts, enabling anyone to mine until 28 June 2022. Users mined around 200,000 TON daily. All the tokens were mined in two years, marking the completion of the distribution event. On September 20, 2021, TON registered its all-time low price at $0.3906. Its first significant break came in November 2021. In days, the coin slid from $0.8 to $4.5.

The team behind Bunni said they do not have enough money to safely restart the project. Bunni Closes Over Lack of Funds Bunni announced on September 2, 2025, that it had fallen victim to a hack that resulted in the loss of approximately $8.4 million. The attackers exploited a vulnerability in the DEX’s smart contracts related to its Liquidity Distribution Function. This allowed them to manipulate internal calculations and drain funds from liquidity pools on Ethereum. While initial reports indicated that between $2.3 million and $2.4 million had been stolen on Ethereum, analysis by QuillAudits and Halborn revealed a further $5.9 million was lost on Unichain. The stolen assets included USDC and USDT, which were consolidated into a single wallet. After the incident, Bunni paused all smart contract activity and advised users to withdraw their funds. The project later revealed via X that restarting the platform would require between six and seven figures in audit and monitoring costs. However, they said they could not afford these expenses, which led them to decide to stop operations. “It is with saddened hearts that we announce the shutdown of Bunni,” wrote the team. The platform’s users will still be able to withdraw their assets through the official website until further notice. The project also plans to distribute the remaining treasury funds to holders of BUNNI, LIT, and veBUNNI tokens, based on a snapshot that will exclude team members. Additionally, the Bunni v2 smart contracts have been relicensed from BUSL to MIT, making features like surge fees and autonomous rebalancing freely available to its ecosystem. Efforts to recover the stolen money are ongoing in collaboration with law enforcement. They closed the statement by thanking the community for its continued support throughout their journey. Back-to-Back DeFi Shutdowns Bunni is the second DeFi initiative to close in less than 48 hours. The Kadena organization also recently announced the cessation of all its business and development activities due to unfavorable market conditions. According to the official statement, the Kadena blockchain will continue to run independently, maintained by decentralized miners and developers. Meanwhile, its native token, KDA, and protocol infrastructure will remain operational without disruption. Members of the X crypto community were quick to respond to the latest developments. One user questioned what was happening to the industry, noting how projects were quitting one after the other. In the aftermath of the announcement, KDA’s price dropped by more than 99% from its 2021 peak of $27.64, with analysts claiming its chart showed signs of dumping days before the team informed the public of the closure.

Although the deadlines for decisions on numerous ETFs pending before the SEC have arrived, the SEC is unable to announce its decisions due to the shutdown. However, despite this delay, new ETF applications continue to arrive. At this point, one of the most established companies in the US, T. Rowe Price, has filed a new cryptocurrency ETF application with the SEC. This was no ordinary application; it marked a significant milestone, symbolizing the company's direct entry into the cryptocurrency market. While the company is active in the ETF market, it was its first ETF application in the cryptocurrency space. The established company, founded in 1937, is seeking regulatory approval from the SEC to launch an actively managed ETF tied to multiple cryptocurrencies. The ETF will offer investors the opportunity to invest in 5 to 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This list currently ranges from Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP to Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). At this point, the $1.8 trillion asset management firm's first foray into the cryptocurrency world comes nearly two years after the SEC approved spot Bitcoin ETFs. Nate Geraci, President of The ETF Store, said in a post on X: “T. Rowe Price has filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an actively managed cryptocurrency ETF. This application is a significant move that completely exceeds market expectations.” *This is not investment advice.

Max Glass sued RWA through the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that RWA’s controlling members, Gregory DiPrisco and Joseph Quintilian, orchestrated a “fiduciary betrayal” to force him out and assume ownership of the company’s stablecoin business without his involvement or consent. According to Glass, the two executives “coerced him into signing away his rights” before launching a separate venture that later became M0, in violation of their contractual duties to him and the firm. Former executive he was ‘deceived’ out of RWA Company In his legal complaint, Glass accuses DiPrisco and Quintilian of engaging in “a scheme of coercion, fraudulent inducement, and subsequent breaches of fiduciary duty,” claiming that they deliberately misled him to gain control of the company’s intellectual property and partnerships. He propounded that the pair diverted RWA’s planned stablecoin project, developed in collaboration with German fintech startup CrossLend GmbH, into a new entity that eventually became M0. M0 is not a stablecoin issuer like Tether or Circle on its own, but provides the infrastructure that has created several multi-million-dollar stablecoin projects, including MetaMask’s mUSD. “The M0 enterprise was built upon the RWA Co.-CrossLend relationship,” Glass stated in the filing, also claiming he was wrongfully cut out from the upside of the project that came directly from his work at the RWA company. CrossLend is a Berlin-based fintech company that digitizes and standardizes loan and mortgage data. Although it is not a crypto-native firm, Glass insists RWA’s collaboration with CrossLend was meant to create a stablecoin product backed by tokenized real-world assets. However, he alleges that his former partners used this partnership to quietly build a new company under a different name that excluded him from the venture’s ownership and future profits. Glass’s attorneys believe there was a “pattern of concealment” from the defendants for several years, during which he says the defendants concealed the relationship between RWA, CrossLend, and M0. He is seeking unspecified damages, restitution, and recognition of his ownership interests tied to RWA’s original stablecoin project. M0 fundraising in August M0 is one of the more prominent players in the digital payments industry since it became a distributed platform helping institutions issue customized stablecoins using its underlying protocol. Much different from centralized issuers such as Circle’s USDC, which never realized its plan for taking service providers under its Centre Consortium, M0’s allows several entities to issue their own stablecoins under a shared standard. Each issuer can “wrap” the base M0 coin with proprietary features for differentiation and customization. In just one year since launch, M0 has facilitated the creation of four active stablecoins with a combined issuance of $325 million. The company closed a $40 million Series B funding round in late August, led by Polychain Capital, Ribbit Capital, and Endeavor Catalyst. M0 fundraisers hit a total of $100 million with the input of Wintermute Ventures, ParaFi Capital, HackVC, Galaxy, Anthony Scaramucci’s SALT, and Bain Capital. CEO Luca Prosperi said the platform presents a “greater autonomy” for fintech builders who prefer using the US dollar in digital form. “We want to empower the builders of great fintech products to actually control the digital dollar stack they use. The current stablecoin technology isn’t fit for that purpose,” he asserted. The stablecoin market is now valued at around $308 billion and could surpass $1 trillion in market capitalization by the end of the decade, according to industry projections. However, Europe’s top financial watchdog ESRB (European Systemic Risk Board), is asking regulators to “tightly” enforce the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The ESRB’s report published last month revealed stablecoins Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC are collectively backed by approximately $129 billion in bonds. It believes that under stress conditions, mass redemptions could kickstart a “bank run” scenario, where issuers would be forced to liquidate their reserves, and this could destabilize bond markets.

The company says rising orders from clients like Tesla and Apple are driving the growth. CEO Jean-Marc Chery said the focus is on “accelerating innovation” and “reshaping our manufacturing footprint.” The projection still falls short of analyst expectations. According to a poll by LSEG, Wall Street was looking for $3.34 billion in Q4 sales and $3.12 billion in Q3. Even so, STMicro is showing some signs of recovery in markets that have been wrecked since COVID: consumer electronics, auto, and industrial chips. STMicro reduces 2025 capex while continuing chip supply for Apple and Tesla While Texas Instruments on Wednesday spooked the market with a gloomy Q4 outlook, STMicro took a different tone, though it’s not throwing money around either. The company quietly slashed its 2025 capital expenditure plan to “slightly below $2 billion,” down from its previous range of $2 to $2.3 billion. It blamed “current market conditions” but didn’t give much detail beyond that. STMicro also gave a nod to its cost-cutting program, saying it “remains on schedule” even after some pushback in Italy. The plan has faced labor resistance in the country, but it seems STMicro is pushing forward regardless. Meanwhile, the firm’s clients are preparing for big chip transitions of their own. Apple is expected to roll out its first 2-nanometer chip, the A20, inside next year’s iPhone 18. This would replace the current 3-nanometer chips Apple uses, which are based on TSMC’s older node. The A20 will also be the base for the new M6 series chips used in Macs. TSMC has already warned partners, including Apple, that the price for this new chip won’t be cheap. Costs are expected to jump by at least 50% compared to the 3-nanometer units. High upfront spending on the new manufacturing node and low yields are part of the reason. Suppliers expect the chip could cost around $280 per unit, which would make it the most expensive component inside the iPhone. Apple will either eat that margin or pass the cost to buyers. Over at Tesla, Cryptopolitan reported that CEO Elon Musk’s custom AI chip, called AI5, will be manufactured by both Samsung in Texas and TSMC in Arizona. “Our explicit goal is to have an oversupply of AI5 chips,” Elon told investors. “Any chips not used in cars or robots can be used in our data centers.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|Apple|STMicro|STMicroelectronics|Tesla|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-23 07:55:09

US Senators Question Witkoff’s Crypto Holdings On Wednesday, eight Senate Democrats, led by Senator Adam Schiff, questioned the US Special Envoy for peace missions, Steve Witkoff, about his digital asset ownership and his links to the Trump Family crypto ventures. In a letter shared by Fortune, the US lawmakers raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest as Witkoff’s latest financial disclosure showed that he has yet to divest from some of his crypto holdings, including an ownership stake in World Liberty Financial (WLF) and the company’s WLFI token. Notably, the US Special Envoy is one of WLFI’s co-founders alongside his son, Zach Witkoff, and members of the Trump Family. “As long as you maintain ownership of these assets, you stand to profit from any decisions you are involved with while serving in the Administration. Moreover, the public has ample reason to be concerned that your decision-making may also be influenced by your close personal and business ties to the Trump Organization,” the letter read. The Senators noted that one of WLF’s co-founders, Zak Folkman, previously affirmed that by May 23, 2025, Witkoff had “no operational role, no financial interest in WLFI deals, and no influence on day-to-day decisions.” Folkman also added that Witkoff was “in the process of fully divesting from WLFI,” which had not happened at the time of the release of White House financial report in August. To the lawmakers, this underscores the “troubling entanglement” between the US Special Envoy’s official duties and his private financial interest tied to the Trump family businesses, highlighting World Liberty Financial’s $2 billion deal with a United Arab Emirates (UAE) firm involving the company’s stablecoin USD1. As reported by Bitcoinist, previous Wall Street Journal (WSJ) coverage raised similar concerns regarding the “extraordinary blurring of government negotiations and private business dealings,” claiming that it is “rewriting the diplomatic playbook for some foreign countries looking to gain traction with the new Trump administration.” In May, the WSJ claimed that father-and-son duo Steve and Zach Witkoff have potentially helped blur the lines of private business and public duties of the current administration, highlighting World Liberty Financial’s deal to enable MGX’s $2 billion investment. The report also noted a previous article that claimed the elder Witkoff was allegedly involved in the talks between the Trump family and Binance. Nonetheless, these talks have been denied by Binance’s co-founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao. Ethical Compliance Inquiries Mount “Your failure to divest your ownership in these assets raises serious questions about your compliance with federal ethics laws and, more importantly, ability to serve the American people over your own financial interests,” the lawmakers stated. In the letter, the Senate Democrats asked Witkoff to respond to multiple requests by October 31, 2025. Among the questions, they inquired about the status of his financial interest in the Trump-linked crypto company. Additionally, they asked the US special Envoy if he had received a written waiver that exempts him from penalties and allows him to participate in key discussions with the UAE while owning a stake in WLFI. If a waiver has not been granted, they also requested an explanation of how Witkoff’s financial holdings do not violate federal ethics laws and regulations, which prohibit government officials from participating in ventures that could benefit them or their relatives. It’s worth noting that Witkoff is one of multiple US officials who have been questioned about their own holdings or the US President’s crypto ventures. In July, Senate Democrats pressed the new head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) about a potential conflict of interest related to the Trump family’s stablecoin, USD1. Earlier this year, two senators raised similar concerns in a letter to former acting chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Mark Uyeda. Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers proposed the Curbing Officials’ Income and Nondisclosure (COIN) Act to prevent crypto-related conflicts of interest four months ago. A recent investigation highlighted that, unlike most of his predecessors, President Trump has not put his crypto ventures in a trust managed by an independent party. However, the White House has denied any potential conflict of interest between the President’s businesses and his official duties.",Crypto News|binance|Conflict of Interests|Crypto Holdings|Dolant Trump|Senate Democrats|Steve Witkoff|Trump Family|UAE Crypto|US Senators|USD1|WLFI|WLFI price|WLFIUSDT|World Liberty Financial,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 08:00:02

Since its official launch on October 15, the campaign has attracted over 50,000 participants and generated more than 10 million global impressions. The campaign spans over 160 countries and regions, underscoring LBank’s expanding international footprint and community reach. The anniversary carnival features three main event tracks: The Claw Machine Lucky Draw, Trade Like a Champion, and Bonus Pro. Users can participate by completing deposit, trading, or referral tasks to earn rewards, including BTC, ETH, SOL, popular meme tokens, and iPhone 17 Pro devices. Official statistics show that on the first day alone, participation exceeded 50,000 entries, while community engagement and trading frequency surged to new highs. https://x.com/LBank_Exchange/status/1978415684922044665 Fueled by this buzz, LBank's platform activity has skyrocketed. The website recorded over 13 million visits, reflecting a 20% quarter-over-quarter increase in web traffic. According to CoinMarketCap, LBank’s average daily trading volume has surpassed $10.5 billion; Messari estimates its global market share at around 3.1%. Meanwhile, CoinGecko data indicates that in the third quarter, LBank’s futures trading volume rose 92.3% quarter-over-quarter, the fastest growth among leading global exchanges. Industry analysts note that LBank’s tenth-anniversary momentum reflects a broader shift in exchange competition, from short-term traffic acquisition to long-term structural strength.

53529815,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=842424,1761206428,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/53529815.jpeg,$1.7 Trillion Firm T. Rowe Price Seeks Approval For Crypto ETF Linked To Multiple Tokens,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/1-7-trillion-firm-t-rowe-price-seeks-approval-for-crypto-etf-linked-to-multiple-tokens/,"According to a Reuters report, global asset management firm T. Rowe Price, with $1.7 trillion in assets under management (AuM), is seeking regulatory approval to launch its first actively managed crypto ETF linked to multiple tokens, marking the firm’s initial entry into the cryptocurrency market space. The Firm’s First Crypto ETF Bryan Armour, an exchange-traded fund analyst at Morningstar, commented on the development stating, “It’s a surprise to see them as a relatively late entrant, but they’re planning to offer something differentiated to try and break into the space.” Related Reading: Crypto Winter Looms: These Key Signals Point To A Deeper Crash Ahead While many asset managers have inundated the SEC with applications for ETFs tied to individual cryptocurrencies like Solana (SOL), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), among the most anticipated, proposals for new multi-coin products that are actively managed remain uncommon, Armour added. T. Row Price’s crypto ETF reportedly aims to provide investors exposure to a selection of five to 15 digital coins that meet specific eligibility criteria. The fund’s prospectus indicates that eligible assets could include Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), SOL, DOGE, and Shiba Inu (SHIB). The managers will target outperformance of the FTSE Crypto US Listed Index, utilizing fundamental, valuation, and momentum factors to guide their asset selections and portfolio allocations, a spokesman told Reuters. T. Rowe Price’s New Digital Assets Strategy Rowe Price has been closely monitoring developments in the digital assets space and has developed the capability to trade digital assets in recent years, Reuters highlighted. In 2022, as one of its first steps to prepare for entering the industry, the firm appointed Blue Macellari, a former crypto hedge fund executive, as head of its digital assets strategy. This could be boosted by recent regulatory developments in the US, where the pro-crypto Trump administration has developed and introduced new crypto bills that aim to lay the foundation for transforming the country into the crypto capital of the world, as Donald Trump himself has stated repeatedly this year. Related Reading: Gold Rotation Impact: Bitwise Warns Bitcoin Could Skyrocket To $242,000 Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, an ETF market analysis firm, commented, “It’s exciting to see them expand their ETF lineup beyond stock and bond exposure.” Numerous crypto ETF applications are awaiting SEC approval amid a government shutdown that has significantly reduced the agency’s operational capacity. These products are unlikely to receive the green light until the shutdown concludes, despite the regulator’s recent adoption of new listing standards that have paved the way for a range of new offerings, including the T. Rowe Price crypto ETF. As of this writing, Bitcoin has resumed its downward trend, dropping to the lower boundary of its consolidation range at $107,988—a 3.5% decrease from Tuesday’s valuation.

While institutions weigh inflation data and market liquidity, retail traders are turning their focus toward coins showing early signs of strength. Ethereum ETFs Stir Fresh Optimism Ethereum is finding its rhythm again. Despite ETF outflows of $145 million this week, ETH climbed 0.5% to around $3,973, a steady recovery after a rough month. Analysts say the coming U.S. inflation report could trigger the next market shift — especially if inflation cools. Institutional investors are also watching SharpLink , which expanded its Ethereum holdings to 859,853 ETH worth $3.5 billion. This move signals growing belief in Ethereum’s long-term strength as a treasury asset. SharpLink’s 450% stock rise over six months adds fuel to the bullish case. With the Ethereum ETF conversation heating up , investors are preparing for a stronger ETH rebound, which often lifts the rest of the market. Many now list Ethereum as a must-watch in the coming weeks among the best altcoins to buy for a massive rebound . Solana Eyes a Sharp Recovery Solana (SOL) continues to attract both retail and institutional interest after briefly dipping below $180. Traders view this as a buy-the-dip setup, with many targeting $250 as the next milestone. Analysts such as John Bollinger have pointed out a potential “W” reversal pattern forming, a structure often linked with price recoveries. This technical setup, alongside recent ETF inflows of $156 million into Solana-based products, has boosted confidence in the altcoin’s ability to regain traction. Institutional demand remains strong. SOL products recorded nearly $3 billion in inflows this year, indicating that buyers are positioning early for a rebound. If ETF approvals go through, Solana could lead the next market-wide move , earning its place among the top altcoins to buy for a massive rebound . Cardano Analyst Predicts 333% Rally Analyst Javon Marks believes Cardano (ADA) is setting up for a massive upswing. Despite its current price of $0.63, Marks predicts ADA could surge to $2.96 , marking a 333% rally . He explained that Cardano has held a consistent uptrend since breaking out of its long-term descending trendline. The pattern of higher highs and higher lows remains intact, signaling that its structure is still healthy. Other market watchers, such as Chris O , forecast even higher levels, between $5 and $8 , once the next cycle accelerates. With the Ethereum ETF hype spreading through the market, ADA remains firmly on the radar for anyone seeking the best altcoins to buy for a massive rebound . Chainlink Gains Institutional Interest Chainlink (LINK) is drawing renewed attention as large investors and institutions circle back to the project. Despite a short-term dip to $17.52, Grayscale and Bitwise have both filed for Chainlink ETFs , potentially opening the door for regulated exposure to the asset. This move could bring in a new wave of demand, similar to what happened with Bitcoin ETF approvals. At the same time, whale wallets have accumulated over 54 million LINK around $16, tightening supply and creating a strong support zone. With Chainlink leading real-world asset integration through partnerships with SWIFT, ICE, and S&P Global , its utility case remains clear. As institutional activity grows, LINK stands out among the best altcoins to buy for a massive rebound in this cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Safe Haven Altcoin on the Rise Amid the ETF buzz and market corrections, MAGACOIN FINANCE has drawn attention as another altcoin to pay serious attention to now . Analysts list it among the top altcoins to buy before the next bullish phase , with its price climbing every hour — no dips, just steady growth. Over 21,000 investors have already joined in, and word is spreading fast about its upcoming CEX listing . As supply tightens, scarcity is setting in, driving more FOMO among early entrants looking for hedge and diversification options. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE: Price climbs hourly with zero dips Safe haven during broader market declines Upcoming CEX listing fueling demand Growing investor base building scarcity Final Thoughts Market sentiment is turning as ETF news reshapes the landscape. Traders looking for the best altcoins to buy for a massive rebound are watching Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, Chainlink , and MAGACOIN FINANCE closely. As prices begin to recover, visiting the MAGACOIN FINANCE website early could be the move that sets traders ahead before the next bullish phase kicks in.

Key Takeaways: Bunni DEX is shutting down after a $8.4 million exploit drained funds across Ethereum and Unichain. The team cited a lack of capital to cover relaunch and security costs, halting all future development. Bunni’s v2 smart contracts have been open-sourced under the MIT License, allowing developers to reuse its technology in new DeFi projects. In an X post on Thursday, the Bunni team said it could not continue operating due to a shortage of funds needed to rebuild and secure the platform. “The recent exploit has forced Bunni’s growth to a halt, and in order to securely relaunch we’d need to pay 6-7 figures in audit & monitoring expenses alone – requiring capital that we simply don’t have,” the team wrote . Bunni Exploit Drains $8.4M Across Ethereum and Unichain The exploit, which took place on September 2, drained $8.4 million across Ethereum and layer-2 network Unichain, prompting an immediate halt to operations. A subsequent blog post on September 4 confirmed that attackers had taken advantage of vulnerabilities within the protocol’s codebase. Built on Uniswap v4, Bunni aimed to optimize returns for liquidity providers through a custom system known as the Liquidity Distribution Function. Before the exploit, the protocol had seen explosive growth. Its total value locked (TVL) jumped from $2.23 million in June to nearly $80 million by mid-August, according to DeFiLlama. While Bunni will no longer operate, the team has open-sourced its Bunni v2 smart contracts, relicensing them from Business Source License (BSL) to the MIT License. The move allows developers to freely integrate Bunni’s innovations, including liquidity distribution functions, surge fees, and autonomous rebalancing, into new DeFi projects. The decision drew praise from parts of the community for preserving the project’s technical contributions. Hello everyone, it is with saddened hearts that we announce the shutdown of Bunni. The recent exploit has forced Bunni's growth to a halt, and in order to securely relaunch we'd need to pay 6-7 figures in audit & monitoring expenses alone – requiring capital that we simply don't… — Bunni (@bunni_xyz) October 23, 2025 Users will still be able to withdraw assets through the Bunni website until further notice, and remaining treasury assets will be distributed to BUNNI, LIT, and veBUNNI tokenholders once legal approvals are secured. Team members will not receive any portion of these funds. The team added that it continues to cooperate with law enforcement to recover the stolen funds. Kadena Announces Shutdown Amid “Difficult Market Conditions” Bunni’s closure follows the recent shutdown of Kadena’s founding team , which also cited “difficult market conditions.” Despite the exit, Kadena’s network remains operational, though its native token KDA has dropped over 70% since the announcement, currently trading near $0.06, per CoinGecko. Kadena’s mainnet went live in January 2020, promising to combine Bitcoin-style security with high throughput through an architecture known as “braided chains.” At its peak in 2021, Kadena’s token reached a market capitalization of nearly $4 billion, supported by a growing community and a $100 million grant program for Web3 developers. But the network struggled to attract sustained adoption. According to data from DeFiLlama , Kadena’s total value locked in DeFi has plunged to just $128,000, down 71% in 24 hours and a far cry from its all-time high of $11 million in August 2022.

X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull), a prominent crypto analyst, recently highlighted these surging metrics, noting that RWA volume has risen by 84%, and stablecoin volume is up 83% in just 30 days. He added that the spike followed the GTreasury and Evernorth $1 billion XRP treasury announcements, pointing to a sharp rise in institutional engagement. The total value of RWAs now stands at $365.39 million, an increase of 4.34%, and the RWA holder count has reached 2,025. The platform currently supports 22 real-world assets and five stablecoins, with the stablecoin market cap now totaling $282.79 million, representing nearly 6% increase from the previous month.

Do the math pic.twitter.com/4jUcmAHv4w — X Finance Bull (@Xfinancebull) October 21, 2025 A Surge Linked to Institutional Activity The sharp increase in activity comes shortly after high-profile treasury-related announcements. The timing aligns closely with the growing use of tokenized treasury instruments on the XRPL. The data dashboard shows leading contributors to tokenized value, including the OpenEden TBILL Vault at $83.86 million, VERT’s 94th CRA tranches totaling more than $90 million combined, and offerings from Montis Group Limited and Ondo’s Short-Term U.S. Government Bond Fund. These assets reflect a trend of traditional financial instruments being issued and traded natively on-chain through the XRPL. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Expanding Institutional Confidence The XRPL’s rise in both RWA and stablecoin activity indicates expanding confidence among institutional users . The platform’s design for high-speed, low-cost settlement has long been viewed as suitable for large-scale financial applications. As on-chain treasury and bond instruments gain traction, XRP Ledger’s role as a settlement and tokenization network becomes more central to blockchain-based finance. Potential Upside for XRP X Finance Bull summarized the market outlook by noting that “trillions will flow” and emphasized that with a market cap of just $146 billion, the upside is massive. While such predictions remain speculative, the rapid growth in real-world usage provides a data-backed case for optimism. The GTreasury and Evernorth initiatives mark a shift toward large-scale corporate and institutional adoption of XRP as a core component in digital treasury operations. With sustained growth and rising institutional confidence, XRP could play a larger role in digital finance, bridging traditional assets and blockchain technology at an accelerating pace.

As traditional blue chips like Bitcoin and Ethereum consolidate, investors are quietly turning to the next generation of 100x Crypto Coins , where entry prices remain low, upside potential is immense, and early adoption is key. Among these, Blazpay’s $0.0075 presale entry has emerged as one of the most compelling opportunities before listings begin. The current market tone is mixed: Bitcoin struggles to reclaim upside momentum, Ethereum remains in a cautious range, and Solana, XRP, and Sui show sparks of life amid uncertainty. Meanwhile, presales like Blazpay are attracting capital from investors seeking both technological depth and scalable adoption. Analysts argue this next wave of 100x Crypto Coins will be defined by AI integration, user engagement, and cross-chain versatility - all pillars Blazpay is already executing at scale. Unlike speculative hype cycles, Blazpay represents a low-entry, utility-first model that blends Crypto AI with financial inclusivity. It’s a token built for traders, developers, and enterprises who see the next frontier beyond hype - the automation of decentralized finance through AI. 1. Blazpay Is Reshaping the AI Finance Landscape Blazpay’s rise during Phase 2 of its presale has been nothing short of impressive. With over 106 million tokens sold, nearly $745,000 raised, and 67.8% completion, the project is steadily gaining traction among early adopters. The current price of $0.0075 per BLAZ token represents what analysts are calling a “pre-hype” valuation - an early entry point that rarely coincides with such strong ecosystem metrics. At its core, Blazpay offers seamless Multichain interoperability, a gamified rewards system, and an AI-powered SDK - a trio of innovations setting it apart from standard DeFi platforms. The platform has already achieved 800K+ active users, 3M+ transactions, and $200K+ in distributed rewards, marking real-world engagement that’s uncommon for projects still in presale. Blazpay’s strength lies in building a unified layer of AI crypto solutions that bridge blockchain ecosystems. As Crypto AI continues to shape the next investment frontier, Blazpay positions itself as the Best Crypto Coin to buy for those seeking long-term compounding returns. Perpetual Trading Meets Unified AI Finance Blazpay is not just another presale - it’s an integrated crypto-financial ecosystem built around AI automation, perpetual trading tools, and cross-chain liquidity solutions. With its upcoming AI-powered financial assistant, users will be able to interact across major chains like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain without leaving the Blazpay interface. The project’s Conversational AI system enables real-time portfolio insights, trading recommendations, and yield tracking, while gamified rewards incentivize user engagement. These elements transform the user experience, blending convenience with performance - a core reason analysts categorize Blazpay among the Next Big Crypto Coin prospects for 2025. As investor sentiment gradually rotates from saturated markets into early-stage AI-driven ecosystems, Blazpay’s approach to Crypto AI makes it a standout. It’s not merely participating in the AI crypto presale wave - it’s helping define it. How a $2,000 Bet in Blazpay Could Multiply Fast With Phase 2 nearing completion, early participants at the $0.0075 price point stand to benefit the most. A $2,000 investment today could yield over 266,000 BLAZ tokens, which analysts believe could see exponential upside following exchange listings. In a conservative projection, if Blazpay reaches $0.25, that $2,000 becomes $66,500. Under moderate market enthusiasm, with prices climbing to $0.50, returns surpass $130,000. And in an optimistic scenario, assuming broad AI crypto adoption and strong liquidity post-listing, prices near $1.00 could generate $266,000+ - a clear testament to its 100x potential. This asymmetric setup - low entry, high potential - is precisely why traders and investors are calling Blazpay the Best Coin to Invest In before 2026. It captures the same early momentum that defined Solana and Cardano in their pre-parabolic phases but with the added benefit of AI integration and live user traction. Blazpay Price Forecast: Early Presale, Massive Upside Analysts expect Blazpay to surge after listings due to its limited supply, cross-chain utility, and strong presale performance. The price has already risen from $0.0075 to $0.009375, showing early demand. Experts see three possible paths ahead: $0.25 (conservative), $0.50 (moderate), or $1.00+ (optimistic) by late 2025, depending on adoption and scaling. With its AI-powered, seamless crypto solutions, Blazpay fits perfectly into the 2025 trend of innovation and financial accessibility. How to Buy Blazpay Before the Next Price Jump Visit the official Blazpay website. Connect your crypto wallet (MetaMask or Trust Wallet). Select your preferred network (ETH, BSC, or SOL). Enter the amount of BLAZ tokens you wish to purchase. Confirm the transaction before Phase 2 ends. Act before the price increases from $0.0075 to $0.009375 to lock in the lowest possible entry and maximize your potential upside. 2. Bitcoin: The Foundation Faces a Turning Point While Bitcoin remains the cornerstone of crypto value, its recent performance reflects macroeconomic headwinds. The October correction has prompted debates among analysts - is this a short-term reset or the start of a broader revaluation? Despite short-term turbulence, Bitcoin’s long-term digital gold narrative endures, keeping it among the Best Crypto Coins to Buy for conservative portfolios. The focus for now lies on market structure recovery and institutional accumulation. For aggressive investors, however, the real excitement is in projects offering better risk-reward profiles - the 100x Crypto Coins leading innovation over legacy. 3. Ethereum: DeFi Titan Balancing Growth and Consolidation Ethereum continues to dominate as the smart contract leader. The chain’s deep integration into decentralized finance and tokenized ecosystems ensures sustained relevance. However, as gas fees and network congestion persist, the market is watching how AI crypto presale projects like Blazpay approach scalability and user experience differently. For investors, Ethereum remains a Best Coin to Invest In, but it may no longer deliver exponential returns relative to smaller, agile projects redefining DeFi infrastructure. 4. Solana: Developers and Traders Reignite Momentum Solana’s ecosystem has rebounded strongly, supported by developer activity and rising decentralized app engagement. The network’s combination of speed, scalability, and cost efficiency makes it one of the Best Crypto Coins to Buy heading into 2026. Still, with Solana’s valuation already high, investors seeking 100x Crypto Coins are looking to early-phase entrants like Blazpay for asymmetric upside - especially those integrating Crypto AI utility layers. 5. XRP: Momentum Returns as Legal Clouds Clear XRP continues to surprise analysts with its resilience. The market’s renewed optimism stems from progress in regulatory clarity and expansion of its cross-border payment infrastructure. As confidence builds, XRP reclaims its role as a liquidity-focused asset within the top market cap tier. However, while XRP’s strength is undeniable, its growth curve remains more measured compared to AI crypto presale tokens like Blazpay that blend innovation with scalability. 6. Sui: Emerging Star in Scalable Networks Sui’s rapid rise has placed it among the new contenders for network efficiency and transaction scalability. Its momentum within Crypto AI circles reflects developer enthusiasm for high-speed infrastructure capable of hosting AI-driven financial protocols - a niche Blazpay also targets. 7. Polkadot: Cross-Chain Vision Strengthened by Upgrades Polkadot’s network upgrades and ecosystem enhancements have revived investor attention. Its elastic scaling and runtime upgrades position it as a long-term interoperability leader, though returns remain moderate compared to rising 100x Crypto Coins like Blazpay . 8. Cardano: Resilience Through Research and Adoption Cardano continues to build patiently, focusing on security and academic-driven innovation. Its community strength and active development keep it in discussions of the Best Crypto Coins to Buy, though investors seeking faster returns are pivoting to AI crypto presales. 9. Avalanche: Enterprise Growth and Network Efficiency Avalanche’s focus on enterprise-grade applications and improved consensus mechanisms makes it a vital player in scalable DeFi ecosystems. Yet, while its technology matures, retail attention is turning to Next Big Crypto Coin stories where early entry offers 100x upside potential. 10. TRON: Network Powerhouse With Stable Traction TRON’s ecosystem thrives on entertainment and utility applications, sustaining strong user activity. Although it remains a blockchain mainstay, its price momentum is comparatively muted. For traders eyeing high-velocity growth, Crypto AI entrants like Blazpay offer more exponential upside. AI-Powered Crypto Revolution: Why Blazpay Leads the Next Wave The ongoing shift toward AI-integrated financial systems will likely define the next market cycle. With early traction, real-world utility, and an accessible presale entry, Blazpay is not just another token - it’s the Next Big Crypto Coin positioned to lead the AI crypto presale revolution. For those scanning the horizon for the next breakout trend, the message is clear: while Bitcoin and Ethereum hold legacy status, Blazpay is where innovation and opportunity meet. In a market poised for transformation, 100x Crypto Coins like Blazpay represent the future of decentralized finance.

However, the spotlight remains on Blazpay, which is rapidly emerging as the Top Crypto Presale of 2025. Currently in Phase 2, the Blazpay presale is priced at $0.0075 per BLAZ token, with 71.2% sold and over $786,200 raised. With the next price increase set to $0.009375, investors are racing to secure early positions before the final phase. While BNB and Chainlink maintain market dominance, Blazpay is drawing attention as the Best Crypto Coin to buy, thanks to its AI-driven ecosystem, multichain SDK, and gamified rewards that combine innovation with accessibility and an edge over high-priced tokens in mature stages. Blazpay Ignites October: The Unified DeFi Revolution Blazpay’s meteoric rise in 2025 comes from its core mission of building a unified, intelligent DeFi experience. The project combines Conversational AI, Perpetual Trading, and Unified Services, creating a connected financial hub where users can trade, earn, and interact across multiple blockchains. At just $0.0075, Blazpay stands out among the Top AI Crypto Coins for offering exceptional entry value. Its user base has already surpassed 800,000+ users, with 3 million+ transactions and over $200,000 in rewards distributed, showcasing real community traction. For early investors, this blend of AI and DeFi innovation marks Blazpay as the Top Crypto Presale and a potential breakout contender heading into 2026. Smart Trading Power: How Blazpay’s Perpetual Trading Redefines DeFi Blazpay’s Perpetual Trading module allows users to execute trades with the precision of centralized exchanges but within a decentralized, AI-optimized environment. With real-time analytics, liquidity routing, and risk management tools, traders gain the speed and control needed to outperform volatile markets. This system is supported by Blazpay’s Unified Services layer, which integrates wallets, staking, and rewards into one seamless platform. Combined, these innovations make Blazpay more than just a presale; it's a next-generation financial engine, further cementing its status as the Top Crypto Presale in October 2025. From $2,000 to $60,000+: The Blazpay Growth Scenario At the current presale rate of $0.0075, a $2,000 investment secures around 266,000 BLAZ tokens. If Blazpay hits just $0.075 (10x) post-listing, that’s a $20,000 return.A move to $0.15 (20x) equals $40,000, and reaching $0.225 (30x) could grow the investment to over $60,000. This exponential potential places Blazpay ahead of larger assets like BNB or Chainlink, where prices have already matured, making it the Best Crypto Coin to buy for those seeking asymmetric upside during the 2025 bull cycle. Price Prediction: Analysts Target $0.05–$0.15 Range for Blazpay Market analysts project Blazpay’s post-listing range between $0.05 and $0.15 within its first trading cycle. The token’s low supply, AI-powered utilities, and multichain support drive strong fundamentals for continued growth. As adoption of its SDK and DeFi integrations expands, Blazpay could easily enter the Top AI Crypto Coins list in 2026, solidifying its long-term value among presale giants. BNB Holds Firm at $1,070 Amid Expanding Ecosystem Binance Coin (BNB) remains one of the most stable assets in the crypto market, currently trading near $1,070 with a market capitalization of $156 billion. As the native token of the Binance ecosystem, BNB offers users transaction fee discounts, launchpad access, and participation in Binance Smart Chain (BSC) governance. While minor short-term corrections have occurred, BNB’s strong user base and BSC adoption provide lasting support. Analysts expect BNB to trade between $1,000 and $1,150, with potential upside driven by upcoming Binance product innovations and institutional partnerships. Chainlink ($LINK) Gains Momentum Near $18 Amid Network Expansion Chainlink (LINK) is trading around $18.02 with a market cap of $12.2B, regaining momentum as its decentralized oracle network expands. LINK remains vital for feeding real-world data to DeFi, insurance, and gaming smart contracts, securing its place among the Top AI Crypto Coins. The network recently added new partnerships and upgrades, boosting security and cross-chain interoperability. With 678M circulating LINK of a 1B total supply, demand is fueled by both institutional adoption and ecosystem growth. Analysts note support near $16.8–$17.0, with potential upside toward $20. Strategic initiatives like the Chainlink Reserve and high-profile advisors, including Eric Schmidt, reinforce LINK’s long-term role as a trusted blockchain infrastructure token. Blazpay, BNB, and Chainlink: Three Pillars of 2025’s Crypto Growth Comparing Blazpay, BNB, and Chainlink, each represents a unique market strength: BNB delivers scalability and ecosystem dominance through Binance. Chainlink powers smart contract connectivity across blockchains. Blazpay merges AI automation, multichain SDKs, and DeFi gamification, representing innovation and early-stage potential. While BNB and LINK drive established networks, Blazpay captures the spirit of 2025’s next-generation growth as an accessible, intelligent presale opportunity leading the Top Crypto Presale market.

Bitcoin is currently trading down 14% from its all-time high and has failed to recover from the record leverage flush earlier this month. With leverage now at the 61st percentile and prices near one-year lows relative to gold, this appears to be a mid-cycle correction rather than the start of a bear market, the analysts noted. No Bear Market Yet Global M2 growth explains over half of Bitcoin’s price variance, reinforcing its role as an anti-money printing asset. According to MacroMicro, global M2 supply has grown by 6.8% since the beginning of the year as central banks continue to print money. The report identified two factors in addition to M2 supply that influence Bitcoin’s price and market movements: global liquidity, leverage, and on-chain activity. Nearly 73% of Bitcoin’s price variance since October 2020 has been explained by changes in futures open interest, while there are strong correlations between blockchain revenues and token prices, which demonstrate real adoption. The investment manager said it wasn’t willing to bet against Bitcoin with fiat debasement accelerating in recent years. “With Bitcoin comprising ~2% of global money supply, we believe digital assets can play an increasingly important role in investment portfolios; arguably, owning less than ~2% Bitcoin or other digital assets is implicitly expressing a short position on the asset class.” Caution: Volatility Ahead The sentiment has been echoed by several analysts recently who opined that the bull market is not over yet. However, there is still a lot of volatility ahead, said investor Ted Pillows. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expects lower inflation next month, which means this week’s CPI report could disappoint, he added. “High inflation usually pressures crypto, since it raises expectations for tighter monetary policy. If CPI comes in lower than expected, crypto could bounce.” MN Fund founder Michaël van de Poppe echoed the sentiment, stating, “markets continue to fumble until the next big macroeconomic event comes in: CPI.” “That’s going to provide a direction for the markets of Bitcoin, and also what we could expect from the Fed.” The delayed CPI report for September is scheduled for release on Friday.

Broader sentiment has been cautious, with many altcoins still trading below their earlier 2025 highs. However, renewed discussions around blockchain adoption and Ripple’s continued efforts to expand the use of XRP in payments have kept the asset in focus. Against this backdrop, we asked ChatGPT to provide a forward-looking projection for XRP’s price on November 1, 2025, taking into account historical patterns, technical indicators, and fundamental drivers. ChatGPT’s Analytical Approach The AI provided a detailed analysis and forecast, offering a range that hints at moderate growth over the next few days. According to ChatGPT, XRP’s price could reach as high as $5, depending on market conditions and broader macroeconomic factors. The AI based this on three key areas: historical performance, current market structure, and adoption progress. In its assessment, ChatGPT noted that XRP historically trails Bitcoin in each major bull cycle. It described the market’s current phase as one where “Bitcoin is wrapping up its post-halving expansion phase, with altcoins like XRP preparing to run next.” With XRP trading at $2.4, ChatGPT suggests it could experience rapid growth in the final days of October. Historical and Technical Observations Looking at XRP’s historical performance, ChatGPT observed that “in 2017 and 2021, XRP’s post-consolidation breakout averaged 8x to 15x from its base once momentum returned.” While it did not suggest such extreme gains would repeat, this pattern informed its projection that further appreciation was possible during the ongoing cycle. From a technical standpoint, the AI highlighted that XRP has already “doubled from its 2024 lows and broken a multi-year descending trendline .” Such developments typically indicate renewed momentum, suggesting XRP could continue to advance. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 On a fundamental level, ChatGPT referenced Ripple’s growing integrations with financial platforms, including the recent $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury , and its support for the newly-formed crypto-asset firm Evernorth, which will build an institutional treasury of XRP and enhance the token’s utility and institutional appeal. Projected Price Scenarios for XRP Based on these combined factors, ChatGPT outlined three specific scenarios for November 1, 2025: Bullish scenario: XRP could reach between $4.2 and $5, assuming a peak in altcoin activity and strong liquidity inflows supported by positive adoption headlines. Base case: A moderate rise toward $3 to $3.5, reflecting steady growth and some market consolidation. Bearish case: A retracement to $1.8 to $2.2, if market conditions weaken or institutional traction slows. After weighing these conditions, ChatGPT provided a single best estimate, projecting XRP’s value at approximately $3.2 on November 1.

The Second Amended Class Action Complaint alleges Chow and associates operated the Meteora-Kelsier Enterprise as a “ fraud factory ” disguised as decentralized finance, using the Meteora liquidity-pooling protocol on Solana as the core engine for multi-token pump-and-dump operations across $M3M3 , $LIBRA , $MELANIA , $ENRON , and $TRUST . Plaintiffs Omar Hurlock, Anuj Mehta, and John Winslow claim that defendants exploited technical settings, like whitelists and freeze/thaw toggles, to acquire a majority of the token supplies at negligible cost before manufacturing artificial price spikes through undisclosed paid influencers. Forensic analysis identified a central coordinating wallet, prefixed 0xcEA, that repeatedly funded deployer wallets, creating tokens, seeding initial liquidity, and financing sniper wallets that captured early supply. Source: Court Listener The lawsuit seeks disgorgement of all profits, trebling of compensatory damages under RICO statutes, and appointment of a qualified independent receiver over Meteora’s upgradeable smart-contract programs. Six-Step Fraud Playbook Exploited Celebrity Endorsements The complaint details a systematic playbook used across all tokens. It begins with narrative invention using borrowed fame, then rigging supply through insider-funded accounts that execute opening-second orders, manufacturing hype through undisclosed paid Key Opinion Leaders, and engineering price spikes using Meteora’s pool controls to pause public trading until insider positions are secured. It also involves executing extraction by selling massive positions while draining liquidity, and reinventing the scheme with new themes but recycled tooling. The $LIBRA fraud exemplified this pattern when Argentine President Javier Milei’s verified social media account posted the contract address at the exact moment pools opened in February 2025, triggering a retail stampede. The campaign styled $LIBRA as a patriotic Argentine revival initiative promising to fund small businesses. Within hours of launch, the deployer wallet withdrew over $110 million in USDC stablecoin liquidity, stripping the token of its foundation and causing instant price collapse, coinciding with Milei’s post-retraction. A group of Argentine #crypto investors have launched a lawsuit against Javier Milei, an outspoken MP and bitcoin advocate who wants to run for president. Read more https://t.co/MplcXKW6rI — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 23, 2022 The $MELANIA fraud marketed the token as the official meme coin of Melania Trump, with claimed vesting mechanisms to protect against dumping. Wallets connected to the Meteora-Kelsier cluster accumulated approximately one-third of the entire supply in minutes before the official launch. After orchestrated hype, insider wallets dumped tokens into the surge, with the price subsequently losing over 90% of market capitalization within days. Kelsier Ventures CEO Hayden Davis, who co-founded both $LIBRA and $MELANIA, stated in a YouTube interview that “ we sniped our own coin to prevent snipers from sniping our own coin. “ Chow Resigned in February, Now Faces RICO Charges Back in February 2025, Ben Chow stepped down from Meteora following the $LIBRA controversy , with Jupiter co-founder Meow stating that, while confident in Chow’s character, he showed “ a lack of judgment and care about some of the core aspects of the project. ” A leaked video posted by SolanaFloor showed DeFiTuna founder Dhirk informing Chow about Davis’s misconduct, with Chow expressing visible shock and stating, “ I feel so sick, because I gave him Melania. I fucked up because I enabled the guy that should not have been enabled. “ The lawsuit alleges that Chow maintained unique expertise in controlling technology, directing the configuration of liquidity pools, fee routing, trading parameters, and the ability to freeze or thaw trading selectively. Kelsier Labs secretly agreed to invest approximately $2 million into Meteora’s operations as a pay-to-play buy-in. Source: Court Listener Whistleblower communications confirm Hayden Davis acted under Chow’s instructions on more than fifteen token launches, establishing central command. The complaint asserts seven causes of action, including fraud, conspiracy to defraud, RICO violations for a pattern of racketeering activity consisting of thousands of wire fraud acts, deceptive practices under New York General Business Law, and unjust enrichment. The timing coincides with broader scrutiny of Trump family crypto ventures, which reportedly generated $1 billion in pre-tax gains over the past year . The $TRUMP and $MELANIA coins generated approximately $427 million, while both tokens experienced dramatic declines during the presidential inauguration, with $MELANIA’s market cap plummeting from $2 billion to $790 million.

It is the second crypto project to fold in the same week blockchain firm Kadena declared bankruptcy and ceased business operations. According to a brief statement written on X post Thursday, the Bunni team confirmed it would be closing down due to a lack of funds, struggling with the extensive financial and technical burden required to rebuild after losing funds to hackers. “In order to securely relaunch we’d need to pay six to seven figures in audit and monitoring expenses alone, capital that we simply don’t have. It’d also take months of development and business development effort just to get Bunni back to where it was before the exploit, which we cannot afford. Thus, we have decided it’s best to shut down Bunni,” the team wrote . Bunni permanently closes its doors after September exploit Ethereum-based decentralized exchange BunniXYZ suffered the exploit in September after one of its smart contracts was compromised, Cryptopolitan reported . According to blockchain data, the attacker targeted stablecoin vaults holding USDT and USDC, before funneling roughly $2.3 million worth of assets through several decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Blockchain investigators found that the hacker moved the stolen tokens by converting parts of the loot into ETH and other stablecoins. The BunniXYZ team closed all active smart contracts to prevent further losses after detecting the breach, but the exploiter was still swapping funds through DeFi protocols in the hours that followed. Bunni mentioned that users would still be able to withdraw their assets via the project’s website “until further notice.” The team also stated plans to distribute treasury assets to holders of BUNNI, LIT, and veBUNNI tokens based on a blockchain snapshot. “The validation of the legal process is ongoing, and the exact details of the distribution will be shared at a later date once the legal process is finalized. Team members will be excluded from the snapshot,” Bunni asserted. Developers also announced that the Bunni v2 smart contracts have been relicensed from Business Source License (BUSL) to the more permissive MIT license. This change will allow the broader DeFi community to reuse its technologies, including Liquidity-Directed Fees (LDFs), surge fees, and autonomous rebalancing mechanisms. “We have pushed the AMM [automated market maker] space forward by a generation, and it would be a shame if our efforts went to waste,” the team stated. Bunni promised to continue cooperating with law enforcement in efforts to recover the stolen assets. “Thank you to everyone who has supported us throughout our journey to push DeFi forward,” the post concluded. The decision to shut down prompted a response from security auditing and Sequoia Capital-backed firm FailSafe, which offered to assist Bunni to keep its operations going. Kadena’s closure preceded Bunni’s Bunni’s shutdown came just over a day after blockchain infrastructure company Kadena revealed it was ceasing operations due to bankruptcy. In a statement posted on Tuesday, Kadena said it was “no longer able to continue business operations” and would immediately halt all activities and maintenance of its blockchain platform. The company told users the closure was a result of deteriorating market conditions, adding that it had notified its employees and would retain a small team to oversee the transition and wind-down process. “The Kadena blockchain is not owned or operated by the company. As a thoroughly decentralized proof-of-work smart-contract blockchain, the network is operated by independent miners, while on-chain smart contracts and protocols are governed independently by their maintainers. We will be encouraging all node operators to upgrade as soon as possible,” the team stated. Kadena reiterated that its native token, KDA, and its protocol will continue to operate post the company’s exit. The blockchain’s tokenomics show more than 566 million KDA still available as mining rewards, which will be distributed through 2139. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

We asked Google’s Gemini AI Assistant what the future holds for the $XRP token, and the response was bullish. Depending on factors, such as the approval of $XRP ETFs, positive news could push the coin’s price to $3 initially, with a new ATH at $4 or beyond also a possibility. The Best Wallet Token is pumping hard and bullish for the coming year. To date, it has raised over $16.6M in its presale. It’s been a tough several weeks for XRP ($XRP), as Ledger’s native token slid sharply after US President Donald Trump’s threat of a fresh round of tariffs on China. From hovering around $3 for most of 2025, it’s currently trading around $2.40. The highly anticipated approvals of $XRP ETFs, however, could give the token a much-needed boost, which could even see it hit a new ATH by next year. With that in mind, we asked Google’s Gemini AI Assistant for an $XRP price prediction to see how it could potentially perform in the foreseeable future. Meanwhile, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is also getting ready for the future as it aims to grab a huge chunk of the crypto wallet market by 2026. Before that, let’s take a look at Gemini’s AI crystal ball and what the coming weeks and months may have to offer. $XRP to Hit $5 in 2026? Here’s What Gemini Thinks The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has received a number of $XRP ETF applications this year, with key decisions meant to be made this week. However, with the lingering US government shutdown, the applicants have yet to hear from the SEC. This has further added to $XRP’s slide along with the market-wide downturn. According to Gemini, approval of these applications will have a positive impact on $XRP, which could push its price to between $2.50 and $3 in the near term, and as much as $4 by early 2026. In addition to this, institutional investors could further drive the coin’s price. One of these is Japanese firm SBI Holdings, which made a massive $200M investment in Evernorth, a Ripple-backed company that aims to be the largest $XRP corporate treasury. Evernorth alone could have a massive impact on the XRP ecosystem, with plans that include institutional lending and DeFi integration. Put together, XRP ETFs, institutional adoption, and expansion of XRP’s capabilities could make it possible for $XRP to push past $3 and even set a new ATH. Best Wallet Token: Ready for Increased Crypto Adoption in 2026. It’s not only $XRP that already has its eyes trained on 2026. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is also working hard to make its crypto wallet a dominant market force as we usher in the new year. 👉🏼 For a detailed guide on $BEST, take a look at our Best Wallet Token review.

West Texas Intermediate rallied to almost $60 per barrel, and Brent gained 3% to trade above $64 as gold descended toward $4,000 an ounce after losing 0.5% on Thursday. President Trump intensified pressure on his counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for lacking commitment to peace in Ukraine. He also threatened stiffer tariffs on India, a key buyer of Russian oil, warning the country to stop buying oil from Russia or suffer the consequences. Senior refinery executives in India stated that the flow of Russian crude oil will gradually decrease to near-zero, noting that the restrictions make it impossible for the flow to continue as usual. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement that his office is sanctioning Russia’s two oil giants that fund the Kremlin’s war machine, given Putin’s refusal to end the senseless invasion of Ukraine. He added that the U.S. encourages its allies to join and adhere to the sanctions. However, Trump said he hopes the sanctions on Russia will not last despite acknowledging that his talks with Putin do not seem to go anywhere. Meanwhile, Trump’s aggressive attempts to reshape global trade and heightened geopolitical uncertainty have also led to a decline in gold prices. Spot gold fell 2.9% on Wednesday after it tumbled nearly 6.3% on Tuesday. The retreat abruptly stopped the gold rally that had been ongoing since mid-August. However, Darwei Kung, Head of Commodities and Portfolio Manager at DWS Group, said the pullback does not change his long-term bullish view on gold. Ziemba says the U.S. has taken meaningful measures Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at the Center for New American Security in Washington, said the sanctions on Russia’s crude are one of the meaningful measures the U.S. has taken. However, she believes the extensive use of illicit financial networks will likely blunt this move. Ziemba claims it will eventually come down to whether India and China fear further escalation in secondary sanctions. The two countries became the biggest buyers of Russian oil after other nations shunned Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. However, Trump imposed crushing tariffs on India for continuing the trade, but has spared China from any action. Meanwhile, the UK sanctioned two Chinese energy firms last week and penalized Rosneft and Lukoil. “The market will take time to digest exactly what this means … It’s likely to be a major cause of concern for the refiners in India and China.” – Vandana Hari , Founder of Vanda Insights. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Trump stated that India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured him that the country would reduce its purchases of Russian crude oil. Previous U.S. measures included a Group of Seven price cap on Russian oil, which limited the Kremlin’s revenue without disrupting global supply or causing spikes in global oil prices. Day claims the drivers of gold have not changed Despite the slump in gold prices, Adrian Day, owner of the namesake asset management firm in Maryland, said gold prices will find a floor within a few days because the drivers of gold have not changed. He added that the Fed will not raise rates and the government will not address the budget deficit because there are no fundamental factors to change what people think or say about gold in a meaningful way. Citigroup’s strategist, Charlie Massy-Collier, said gold prices had run ahead of the debasement narrative, adding that gold’s bullishness is bound to return. However, given the current price levels, he claimed there is no rush to position for that comeback. Meanwhile, Bloomberg’s macro strategist Ven Ram believes the slump in gold prices was just an accident waiting to happen. The decline also came as investors weighed potential progress in trade talks between the U.S. and China. The recent resurgence of tension also appears to increase demand for the haven asset.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has rapidly captured the spotlight as a top crypto to buy in 2025. Currently priced at just $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, already over 70% sold out, Mutuum Finance has raised more than $17.75 million, signaling strong investor confidence in its long-term vision. What makes this new crypto coin stand out is its groundbreaking dual-lending protocol, which merges Peer-to-Peer and Peer-to-Contract lending models. This hybrid design allows users to lend, borrow, and earn yields seamlessly within one ecosystem, dramatically improving capital efficiency compared to traditional DeFi platforms. With the Sepolia Testnet launch of its Lending and Borrowing protocol scheduled for Q4 2025, featuring liquidity pools, mtTokens, and ETH/USDT collateralization, Mutuum Finance is shaping up as a serious Ethereum successor. For investors seeking the next-generation DeFi powerhouse, MUTM offers both innovation and early-entry potential, a combination that could define the next major crypto breakout. Ethereum (ETH) Supply Squeeze Could Herald a Possible Major Breakout in the Near Term Ethereum (ETH) is likely to experience its next major move since on-chain metrics suggest that there might be a possible supply squeeze in place. Exchange reserve levels have fallen to an all-time record low of 2025 at approximately $60.8 billion, which implies that whales are actively accumulating and usable supply keeps declining. This contraction liquidity, with near $19 billion open interest and favorable funding rates, means that market participants are slowly turning bullish again. ETH is now around $3,800-$4,000, a pivotal level which will decide whether the next move is going to be a break to the upside in a fiery manner or another round of consolidation. Several analysts are drawing parallels with late 2020, a time of low-profile build-up ahead of Ethereum’s huge rally to all-time highs. As Ethereum gains momentum, smart money investors are also eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the project that may gain from fresh money inflow into decentralized finance in Ethereum’s next bullish cycle. Mutuum Finance’s Accelerating Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fast becoming one of the cryptos to watch out for in 2025. Its presale has been incredible, with it already raising $17.75 million in 6 Phases from over 17,370 investors. Phase 6 is well over 70% sold out. Its runaway speed has generated huge investor demand, cementing Mutuum Finance as the top crypto to buy at the moment and a new crypto coin catching serious attention in the DeFi ecosystem. With the presale price now at $0.035, investors are getting MUTM at its lowest point of entry prior to the next cost increase. On Phase 7 commencement, the token will grow by 14.28%, creating a distinct motive for early entry as Mutuum Finance positions itself for its next most significant growth phase.

A total of 9.5 BTC were claimed in small denominations. A total of nine Casascius coins were opened today, after years of holding. The coins, worth 5 BTC, 1 BTC and 0.5 BTC, released a total of 9.5 BTC and presumably all related hard forks coins including BCH. The coins were opened a few months after one user claimed a 100 BTC gold Casascius coin, inadvertently releasing the private key before claiming the BCH forked coins. The coins were opened within the span of a few hours, suggesting they may belong to one person. The wallets receiving 0.5 BTC also has a history of splitting 100 BTC into multiple addresses. All of the current wallets that received the newly opened funds from their small-scale coins previously connected to a single address, which distributed 100 BTC in April 2013. It is possible the original 100-BTC wallet opened a gold bar or coin with 100 BTC, then distributed it to additional wallets. The newly opened coins may be part of the same person’s reserves. The opening of several coins follows a recent claim for a one-BTC coin on October 1. Casascius coin openings are now relatively rare, as the holders also retain them for their unopened premium value or as collectible items. In 2025, a total of 432 coins were redeemed, holding 1,100 BTC. The estimated amount in still-active coins is around 38,000 BTC. Less than half of Casascius coins are opened Casascius coins are a novelty, and most seem to drive a strong holding ethos. For now, fewer than 50% of the coins have been opened. There are three still unopened 1,000 BTC coins, one 500 BTC coin and another 35 100-BTC gold bars. Additionally, there are hundreds of still-active coins with smaller denominations, including the most numerous 1-BTC coins. Of those, 12,943 are still active. In total, over 17K coins and bars are active, with around 10K opened. The unclaimed amount of BTC is now valued at over $4B. Casascius coin owner reawakens as BTC stages a recovery The physical coins funded with BTC were activated just as the market was attempting another recovery. BTC traded at $109,670, despite recent selling pressure. In the past months, older whales have taken profits from BTC . Casascius coin owners have tried to secure their coins into new addresses, or seek ways to cash out. Some of the bars were acquired as early as 2011, when BTC was just gaining popularity.

The company, in partnership with Kalshi, is testing the new product in beta as part of a wider effort to diversify its DeFi offerings. The feature allows users to place bets on real-world outcomes, beginning with the Mexico Grand Prix, marking Jupiter’s first step into the growing prediction market sector. The move comes as institutional demand for event-based trading surges, positioning Jupiter to capture fresh liquidity and strengthen its ecosystem within Solana’s expanding network. Jupiter’s Prediction Market Targets Rapid Expansion Jupiter’s Chief Operating Officer, Kash Dhanda, said prediction markets represent a significant step in expanding the range of assets available on-chain. He explained that the product aims to enhance user experience, attract more participants, and create new synergies across Jupiter’s existing services. Dhanda confirmed that the company will continue developing the platform based on user data, noting that community feedback will guide how quickly they scale trading limits and introduce new events. Currently, users can hold up to 1,000 contracts, while global participation is capped at 100,000 contracts during the beta phase. The Mexico Grand Prix market has already surpassed $100,000 in trading volume, with Max Verstappen leading 46% of predictions, followed by Lando Norris at 27%. Jupiter plans to expand to sports, politics, and global affairs once stability is confirmed, aiming for a complete rollout by Q4 2025. Growth in Users and Institutional Momentum According to Jupiter’s Q3 tokenholder report , the platform recorded 8.4 million active users, up 5% from the previous quarter. Dhanda said this expansion will reinforce long-term value for JUP token holders, adding that every new market strengthens the company’s cross-product integration and revenue growth. The project enters a booming sector, with Kalshi recently raising $300 million in a Series D round led by Sequoia Capital, Paradigm, and Coinbase Ventures, pushing its valuation to $5 billion. Meanwhile, Polymarket drew a $2 billion investment from Intercontinental Exchange, reaching a $9 billion valuation. Data from Dune Analytics shows the industry’s weekly trading volume hit $2.03 billion in mid-October, signaling rising institutional appetite for such platforms. Solana Price Strengthens as Momentum Builds As Jupiter expands, Solana (SOL) is showing positive signs. The token trades near $188 , rebounding from support around $180. Analyst Trader Tardigrade observed that SOL’s four-hour chart indicates a bullish MACD crossover, suggesting renewed momentum.

BTC to Challenge $110K? The primary cryptocurrency ended the previous business week with another decline, this time to under $104,000. However, the bulls reacted swiftly and didn’t allow a possible slump below $100,000, and BTC bounced off to $107,000 during the weekend. The new business week began more positively, with BTC surging to $111,000 on Monday. After a correction to under $108,000, the asset went on the offensive hard on Tuesday and skyrocketed to $114,000 within hours. However, that turned out to be a fakeout, and BTC lost all the momentum almost immediately. Moreover, it dumped to $106,200 (on Bitstamp) on Wednesday. It has reacted well to this correction and even tapped $110,000 earlier today. Although it has failed at reclaiming that level, it now stands above $109,000.

In an October 22 post on X, the author of Rich Dad Poor Dad called the asset the world’s “first truly scarce money,” highlighting its limited supply. He further added that the scarcity will only intensify as the remaining unmined supply dwindles. “Bitcoin is first truly scarce money… Only 21 million ever to be mined. World close 20 million now. Buying will accelerate. FOMO real. Please do not be late. Take care,” Kiyosaki wrote. Why I am buying Bitcoin. Bitcoin is first truly scarce money… only 21 million ever to be mined.

In a new social media post , the author criticized sensational headlines predicting both Bitcoin’s collapse and potential meteoric rise. “I now see “click bait” titles screaming “gold, silver, Bitcoin crashing” or Butcoin to $2 million this month. Then the podcaster then says “To support my channel click and subscribe.” Give me a break,” he added. CLICK BAIT???

Then the podcaster then says “To support my channel “click and subscribe” Give… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) October 23, 2025 To punctuate his rant, Kiyosaki pointed to the U.S. national debt of $37 trillion as a key indicator of why he believes in hard assets, such as precious metals. However, he also stressed that Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) are likewise the “real money” today. Bitcoin still weak Clickbait or not, Bitcoin keeps facing weakness this week.

Hyperliquid Strategy, a strategic stockbroker for HYPE, has filed an S-1 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise up to $1 billion.

The filing follows the company's formation in July through the merger of Nasdaq-listed biotech firm Sonnet BioTherapeutics and Rorschach I LLC, a special purpose company (SPV). “The company intends to distribute its HYPE token holdings selectively, primarily by staking nearly all of its HYPE holdings. This is expected to yield consistent staking rewards,” the company said in its filing.

FILES S-1 WITH THE SEC TO RAISE $1B THROUGH 160M SHARES.PART OF THE FUNDS FOR POTENTIAL $HYPE TOKEN PURCHASES. 8:22 am · 23 Oct 2025 108 Reply Copy link Read 20 replies Hyperliquid Strategies, a newly formed digital asset treasury company, is raising $1 billion for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of Hyperliquid’s native token, HYPE. The company is being created through a merger between Nasdaq-listed biotech firm Sonnet BioTherapeutics and special purpose acquisition firm Rorschach I LLC. Once completed, the entity will operate as a crypto-focused treasury firm centered on the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Such narratives triggered bullish sentiments, as they reflect Hyperliquid Strategies’ confidence in its vision of dominating crypto-native liquidity solutions and on-chain treasury management. The potential $1 billion in new equity funding suggests adequate liquidity for the decentralised exchange. The Hyperliquid ecosystem can leverage the capital to accelerate governance programs and network development. HYPE will gain more utility as the DEX expands. BitMex co-founder Arthur Hayes predicted that Hyperliquid would eclipse Binance and become the largest trading platform globally. He said : By the end of this cycle, Hyperliquid will be the largest crypto exchange of any type, and Jeff Yan might become richer than CZ, the founder and former CEO of Binance. The Kind is dead. Long live the King! A recent study by BitCourier shows Hyperliquid is gaining ground, though Binance dominates liquidity with over $40B in daily trading volume. The DEX’s volume ratio to Binance has increased from 8% early this year to 13.6%. The researchers added : This growth shows that traders are increasingly confident in Hyperliquid’s ability to deliver deep, on-chain liquidity comparable to major centralized venues. On the other hand, Binance has seen its share of challenges recently. For example, the cryptocurrency community has criticised the exchange for facilitating the October 10, 2025, crash. Binance reportedly froze key functionalities as the market plunged, magnifying losses for users who failed to exit to limit losses. Now, Hyperliquid Strategies wants to raise $1 billion to accelerate the project’s expansion. If the deal goes through, the publicly listed company might use the funds to improve liquidity pools, introduce innovative financial tools, and enhance the overall Hyperliquid ecosystem. Such developments could solidify HYPE’s status as the leading digital coins for decentralised treasuries.

Stablecoins are now a global macroeconomic force, announces a16z in its new State of Crypto report , shedding light on the sector’s rapid growth and what it means for the broader market. The claim is backed by strong numbers: Over 1% of all US dollars in circulation exist on public blockchains as tokenized stablecoins. Together, they hold more than $150B in US Treasuries, leaving countries like Saudi Arabia and Germany behind to secure the 17th ranking. Although the crypto market is wobbly after $BTC hit a new ATH earlier this month, that hasn’t tainted its long-term picture. The recent turbulence may have managed to knock $BTC off $110K, but stablecoin trends signal that the market’s maturing – and price corrections are part of the deal. For context, the stablecoin market cap has crossed $300B for the first time ever, as the transaction volume jumps 106% in a year to touch $46T. To grasp how staggering that figure is, we just need to compare it with the world’s largest payment networks. Stablecoin volume is now nearly three times Visa’s volume ($16T) and set to overtake ACH Network ($87T), the same a16z report showed. Several Catalysts Have Come Together While stablecoins were limited to crypto nerds in their early days, they’re now seen as one of the most reliable ways to transfer money cross-border. Ease of use is definitely the primary factor behind their wide use. For this, we have advancing blockchain infrastructure to thank, with some networks capable of processing more than 3400 transactions per second. Murky crypto regulations held back stablecoin adoption for a long time, but crypto regulations like the GENIUS Act have changed that in the US. And the shift is visible across the world. For example, the UK is preparing to introduce a stablecoin framework by the end of 2026. Financial giants and fintech companies have also been actively exploring the digital asset market, encouraging others to follow. For crypto investors, the newly published report is a reminder to expand their portfolios. But being mostly pegged to US dollars, the value of stablecoins reflects the growth of the US economy – not the crypto market. So how can one gain exposure to this booming sector? The answer lies in promising crypto infrastructure projects, which reflect the market’s rapid growth. That explains why strategic investors are stocking up on Best Wallet Token for early-bird prices this month, pushing its presale past $16.6M. Why Best Wallet Token Is the Project to Watch Now Unless blockchain infrastructure evolves alongside rising retail and institutional crypto adoption, sustaining growth will be difficult. The market needs secure wallets, exchanges, and networks to bring more crypto users on board. Noncustodial wallets, in particular, are growing more popular than ever. Since holders have complete control over their private keys, they allow true ownership – in line with the market’s original motto of financial freedom without intermediaries. With hundreds of thousands of users and glowing reviews on both App Store and Play Store, Best Wallet has emerged as a top trending noncustodial crypto wallet this year. What’s behind this growing frenzy? The platform is secured with Fireblocks MPC tech, offering advanced security without compromising user experience. Being multichain, the wallet is flexible and allows users to switch assets between top blockchains like Ethereum, Bitcoin, Polygon, and BNB Chain. 50 more network integrations are on the way. The Best ecosystem is not limited to its crypto storage solution. It also offers features such as cross-chain swaps and presale access that give it a strong edge against market leaders like MetaMask. For example, the platform plans to launch an everyday crypto shopping card in its next phase, as part of its mission to drive retail crypto adoption. As the native crypto of a trending crypto ecosystem in a fertile niche, Best Wallet Token ($BEST) positions itself as a top crypto to buy now . More than a representation of the project, $BEST unlocks various perks and privileges in the ecosystem – like early access to new projects, reduced transaction fees, higher staking rewards, and community governance rights. These utilities could work well to anchor the token’s value and resilience, helping it withstand turbulent markets and maintain steady growth. See the full $BEST roadmap on the official site. What to Know About $BEST and the Ongoing Presale While the Best Wallet app is already up and live with a growing community of users, the $BEST token is currently on presale. The investment opportunity is still fresh, since $BEST has yet to go live on exchanges. Now in the second roadmap phase, the token is available for purchase at just $0.025835 for the next few hours. Our Best Wallet Token price prediction projects the price to reach $0.072 by the end of the year and as high as $0.62 in 2026, considerably above today’s early prices. For detailed presale instructions, see this ‘ How to Buy Best Wallet Token ‘ guide. Once the next presale stage begins, new adopters will have to pay a higher price to secure the token. Additional staking rewards apply, but the rate is dynamic and bound to go down over time (currently at 79% APY). Visit the official Best Wallet Token presale.

This is even as the meme coin sector stirs with fresh momentum in Q4 2025. Shiba Inu has hovered near $0.000013 to $0.000014 after months of slippage. Yet community fervor and Shibarium’s transaction surge keep it afloat. This setup hints at a double from current depths if resistance cracks. Meanwhile, a viral altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , has captured eyes with projections of 43x upside from its presale perch, blending DeFi utility against SHIB’s speculative roots. Investors now weigh this best crypto to buy now amid stabilizing signals. Such dynamics underscore how altcoins like these reshape recovery plays. Early adopters sense the shift, chasing yields beyond hype. Shiba Inu Braces for Key Resistance Break Shiba Inu has stabilized after a prolonged dip, drawing trader focus to the $0.00003 threshold. That level looms as a pivotal barrier, one that could ignite bullish reversal if breached and held. Speculation builds around this mark, promising over 100% gains from today’s lows. Shibarium’s Layer-2 network has fueled optimism lately, processing millions of transactions since mainnet rollout. Developers there push DeFi tools and NFT hubs, easing fees while expanding SHIB’s role beyond memes. Burn efforts have accelerated too, with community members torching tokens to curb supply bloat near 589 trillion. These actions, though incremental, bolster deflationary hopes. Yet hurdles persist; vast circulation demands explosive demand for real lifts. Analysts note retail resurgence and macro lifts as prerequisites. Social spikes on platforms like X often precede SHIB’s sharpest climbs, a pattern that has repeated since 2021’s frenzy. Still, competition erodes its edge. Newer entrants tout refined tokenomics and transparency, siphoning attention from SHIB’s legacy vibe. The Shib Army rallies loyally, but sustaining buzz grows tougher in a crowded field. Traders eye this rebound warily, balancing nostalgia against fresher prospects. Mutuum Finance Presale Hits Stride Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has surged into phase 6 of its 11-phase rollout, with 75% of allocations snapped up swiftly. This DeFi crypto now trades at $0.035 per token, a 250% climb from phase 1’s $0.01 entry. Funds raised have topped $17,750,000 since inception, drawing 17,370 holders into the fold. Phase 6 sells out fast, closing the window on this pricing before phase 7 hikes it 14.3% to $0.04. Launch beckons at $0.06, projecting 420% ROI for current buyers post-deployment. The protocol’s dual lending setup—peer-to-contract pools for stable yields on ETH and USDT, paired with peer-to-peer options for niche assets—drives its appeal as the next big crypto. Depositors earn via mtTokens, redeemable for principal plus interest, while over-collateralization shields against swings. This structure has lured cautious investors seeking utility over volatility. Team members unveiled a dashboard lately, spotlighting the top 50 holders alongside a 24-hour leaderboard. Daily resets at 00:00 UTC keep competition keen; the top spot claims a $500 MUTM bonus after one transaction. Recent leaders posted buys of $510.56, $472.47, and $470.21 in the last cycle. Such mechanics foster steady engagement. A $100,000 giveaway amplifies the buzz. The giveaway splitting prizes among 10 winners at $10,000 MUTM each. Participants submit wallet addresses, tackle quests, and invest at least $50 in the presale to qualify. These steps not only reward loyalty but also expand the holder base organically. Version 1 testing on Sepolia hits Q4 2025 , featuring liquidity pools, debt tokens, and liquidation bots with initial ETH-USDT support. CertiK’s 90/100 audit score underscores this prep, marking MUTM as a defi crypto primed for scale. Rebound Sparks Altcoin Hunt Traders chasing Shiba Inu’s $0.00003 push now pivot toward altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), where 43x upside from $0.035 aligns with DeFi’s rebound arc. This best crypto to buy now offers tangible lending tools, outpacing meme volatility with structured growth. Secure your position in phase 6 before it vanishes; act on this next big crypto before phase 7’s markup.

FalconX Pushes Into Crypto ETFs & ETPs With 21Shares Acquisition As announced in a press release , FalconX has agreed to acquire 21Shares . FalconX is an institutional crypto prime brokerage that provides large clients with deep global liquidity, derivatives, financing, custody, and settlement across digital asset markets. It has facilitated over $2 trillion in trading volume and hosts a global client base of more than 2,000 institutions. Meanwhile, 21Shares is the largest issuer of crypto exchange-traded funds and products (ETFs/ETPs). ETFs/ETPs refer to investment vehicles that allow investors to gain exposure to an underlying asset without directly having to own it. When a trader invests into one of these vehicles, the provider buys and custodies the asset on their behalf. Some investors may be wary of navigating crypto exchanges and wallets, so products like ETFs and ETPs provide for a more regulated means of investment into digital assets, in a mode that’s more familiar. 21Shares has 55 of these products listed currently, across which it manages over $11 billion in assets. With the acquisition, its asset management product development and distribution capabilities will be combined with FalconX’s institutional-grade infrastructure. The press release noted: Together, the two firms will accelerate the creation of tailored investment products that meet growing institutional and retail demand for regulated digital asset exposure. While FalconX is acquiring 21Shares, the latter will continue to operate independently, with Russell Barlow, its current CEO, remaining in charge. Barlow will work closely with FalconX leadership to advance a shared vision for the digital asset ecosystem. “No changes to the construction or investment objectives of the existing 21shares ETPs (Europe) or ETFs (US) are planned,” said the press release. In some other news, the Bitcoin derivatives landscape has been changing recently, as on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has highlighted in an X post . Previously, the Futures market was dominant, but now the Options market is beginning to rival it in terms of Open Interest . The Open Interest here is naturally a measure of the total amount of positions related to the crypto that are currently open on all derivatives exchanges. First, here is a chart that shows the trend in this metric for the Futures market: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Futures Open Interest saw peaks above $20 billion in the 2021 bull market and recently reached a high of about $50 billion. The Options Open Interest couldn’t even break $15 billion in the last cycle, but today its 7-day moving average (MA) value is floating around a new all-time high (ATH) of more than $55 billion. As the analytics firm has explained, Markets are shifting toward defined-risk and volatility strategies, meaning options flows, rather than futures liquidations, are becoming a more influential force in shaping price action. Bitcoin Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $107,800, down over 4% in the last 24 hours.",Crypto News|21Shares|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|btc|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto ETFs|Cryptocurrency|FalconX,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SPONSORED|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 10:00:47

US President Donald Trump is probably the most pro-crypto president in the world. To name a few crypto initiatives proposed under his admin: the GENIUS and CLARITY acts, the crypto 401k initiative , the national US Bitcoin Reserve, and Trump’s dream to make the US the ‘crypto capital of the world.’ It’s not an exaggeration to call Trump the Crypto President. His Truth Social posts make or break crypto markets, and he’s even launched his own meme coin ($TRUMP). Best of all, much of the current market’s bullish momentum is due to Trump’s pro-crypto agenda. Bitcoin and top altcoins have peaked thanks to his administration. If you’re looking for the latest updates on Trump’s crypto policies before the market prices them, you’ve come to the to right place. We update this page regularly throughout the day with the latest insider knowledge about Trump’s crypto moves. Keep refreshing to stay ahead of the pack!

Trump Crypto Momentum Builds: Fed’s Waller Announces Payment Innovation, Paving the Way for PEPENODE October 23, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Fed Governor Christopher Waller says the Central Government is entering a ‘new era’ with its new prototype. He said that DeFi will no longer be seen with suspicion or scorn and that distributed ledgers and crypto are now ‘woven into the fabric of the payment and financial systems.’ Appointed by Trump during his first term, Waller is one of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and his address marks a sharp pivot from how the Biden administration viewed crypto. Waller also introduced the idea of ‘ Skinny master account ,’ that would limit interest, overdrafts, and balance sizes, enabling innovation without jeopardizing monetary stability. Central Bank’s newer stance could reshape the US crypto landscape with the legitimization of DeFi and stablecoins as part of the financial mainstream. With Central Bank’s new protocol paving way for crypto innovation, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) emerges as a breakthrough presale project that merges gamified-mining with meme culture. The project’s interactive mine-to-earn ecosystem breaks away from the typical hype-driven image around meme coins, rewarding holders for active participation. Learn how to buy $PEPENODE in our guide here . Solana Reclaims 5-Year Bullish Trendline as Trump’s Crypto Policies Make $250 Possible Again October 23 2025 • 10:00 UTC Solana is back on a major 5-year trendline that spells bullish potential, according to an X trader. This pattern has always preceded big rallies, and we could see $SOL rally to $250. Part of this bullish cycle is clearly due to Trump’s pro-crypto policies and the digital asset treasury race that many S&P 500 companies are in. The best thing about $SOL’s current trendline is its resistance to market dumps and unexpected shocks. Back during the 2022 crash and FTX’s collapse, Solana walked out with relatively few scraps while other cryptos went to the dogs. Now, even Citadel’s CEO is sticking a claim in Solana treasury firms , and according to CoinGecko, companies hold over $2.5B in $SOL, spread across three countries. All this institutional attention to $SOL will trickle down to Solana projects like Snorter Token ($SNORT) , which is building the cheapest and fastest $SOL trading bot on Telegram. With $5.4M raised in a presale that’s ending in little over 4 days, $SNORT looks very promising with a token price of just $0.1083. See what our $SNORT price prediction has to say about its potential.

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/german-analyst-xrp-is-no-longer-just-a-coin-heres-why/,"A recent video shared on X by crypto commentator Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto) featured a German financial analyst discussing how Ripple’s latest moves could reshape its position in global finance. The analyst highlights two major developments: Ripple’s $1 billion acquisition of GTreasury and the creation of Evernorth, a company designed to hold an XRP treasury of over $1 billion. BREAKING: Germany analyst says $XRP is no longer “just a coin”… it’s evolving into the bridge layer for global banking. Ripple’s GTreasury Management software, already installed in 13,000+ banks, is expanding fast after a $1B acquisition. pic.twitter.com/RtBhZRZRLu — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) October 21, 2025 GTreasury Acquisition Expands Ripple’s Banking Reach Ripple announced earlier this month that it had acquired GTreasury , a leading provider of treasury management software used by over 13,000 financial institutions. The acquisition, valued at $1 billion, marks one of Ripple’s most significant steps toward embedding its technology into traditional banking infrastructure. GTreasury’s platform supports core treasury functions, such as cash management, risk assessment, and liquidity forecasting. With the company now under Ripple’s ownership, its software could serve as a direct entry point for integrating Ripple’s blockchain solutions , including XRP-based payment rails, into established financial systems. Via gaining control of software already deployed across major institutions, Ripple has earned an operational base for linking the XRP Ledger, XRP, RLUSD, and its custody solutions to treasury processes. The integration could allow banks to manage and move liquidity more efficiently through Ripple’s network, potentially increasing transactional use of XRP over time. The acquisition is part of its vision to modernize corporate finance operations. According to company statements, the goal is to streamline how organizations handle global payments and manage liquidity, combining traditional treasury management with blockchain capabilities. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Evernorth Establishes an Institutional XRP Treasury Alongside the GTreasury deal, Ripple has backed Evernorth Holdings, an entity designed to become the largest publicly listed XRP treasury . The company plans to raise over $1 billion through a SPAC merger expected to close in 2026. Evernorth aims to hold and deploy XRP in regulated institutional environments, creating structured exposure for corporate and financial clients. Evernorth’s backers reportedly include Ripple, SBI Holdings, Pantera Capital, and several other major firms in the digital asset sector. Evernorth is a key piece of Ripple’s ecosystem expansion, as it could evolve into a central treasury layer supporting XRP’s role in enterprise finance. What’s Next for XRP? These moves strengthen Ripple’s narrative that XRP is transitioning from a speculative token to a functional component in financial infrastructure. The German analyst stated that XRP is no longer “just a coin” and these developments signal Ripple’s intent to integrate deeply with corporate and banking systems. Together, the GTreasury acquisition and Evernorth’s planned treasury operations position Ripple to connect traditional finance with blockchain technology at an institutional level, a shift that could redefine how XRP is utilized in the years ahead.

The firm plans to allocate approximately $6 billion to support more mature companies, nearly doubling its previous growth fund. Additionally, it is seeking $1.5 billion each for AI applications and AI infrastructure-focused funds, as well as over $1 billion for its “American Dynamism” initiative, which targets manufacturing and defense-related start-ups. If the firm hits its $10 billion goal, it will mark the firm’s largest fundraising effort to date, surpassing its previous raises of $7.2 billion in 2024 and $9 billion in early 2022. The new capital will support both new investments and follow-on funding for existing portfolio companies. Andreessen Horowitz has been backing multiple corporations Since its most recent fundraising round, approximately 18 months ago, Andreessen Horowitz has been involved in several large startup financing deals, including investments in OpenAI and the xAI initiative . The firm also counts Databricks, Mistral, and Black Forest Labs among its investments in AI and software. Additionally, it has been backing major tech names like Coinbase and Anduril. Considering AI startups require more capital than most, a significant portion of the new fund will be reserved for providing additional funding to Andreessen Horowitz’s existing portfolio, insiders say. Founded in 2009 and managing $46 billion in committed capital, Andreessen Horowitz has grown to be a politically influential venture capital player, with former executives now serving in key roles in the Trump administration. The company’s former managing partner, Scott Kupor, was tapped to head the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, and Sriram Krishnan, a former partner, now serves as the White House’s top adviser on AI policy. Meanwhile, following its seed round just six months ago, FurtherAI announced $25 million in Series A funding on Wednesday, led by Andreessen Horowitz — one of the largest early-stage investments in insurance AI. The funds will be used to accelerate product development, develop additional integrations, and grow the team of solution experts, according to the company. CEO Aman Gour even stated that the partnership will help the company modernize an industry that’s long relied on outdated systems. He added, “We’re grateful to partner with leaders across the industry as they modernize operations. Joe Schmidt, Partner at a16z , had also praised the insurance company, “FurtherAI is redefining how insurance gets done.” A16z reported on a bullish outlook for crypto On Wednesday, the firm also published its “State of Crypto 2025″ report. The firm’s latest report is broadly optimistic about the prospects of cryptocurrency, highlighting 2025 as a critical year for institutionalization, with significant developments expected in user adoption, technology, and U.S. regulation. Cryptocurrency is now taking “its place in the economy” as an asset class, according to the report, which notes that Bitcoin represents a majority of all market value and stablecoins’ circulation volumes equivalent to those of Visa . Over the last year, stablecoins have facilitated approximately $46 trillion in payments, surpassing PayPal’s payment volume. However, it’s limited when considering privacy, scalability, and adaptability for AI. So far, the Californian firm has already raised more than $7.6 billion across four funds dedicated to cryptocurrency investments. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

The company intends to offer up to 160 million shares of its common stock. Chardan Capital Markets has been roped in to serve as the financial advisor for the fundraising. Hyperliquid S-1 Filing Hyperliquid Strategies is a pending merger between Nasdaq-listed Sonnet BioTherapeutics and the special purpose acquisition firm (SPAC) Rorschach I LLC, a transaction first announced in July and expected to close within the year. Following completion of the merger, the entity will trade on Nasdaq under a new ticker symbol. The company’s leadership includes Chairman Bob Diamond, formerly CEO of Barclays, and CEO David Schamis. Announcing the same, Schamis said , “Today we filed an S1. This document is to allow us to issue additional equity into the market following the close of our transaction. We will only be selling equity if and when we believe the market conditions to be favorable. We have no obligations or requirements to issue any additional capital.” According to the filing, proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes, including the expansion of its treasury holdings of Hyperliquid’s HYPE token. Currently, Hyperliquid holds 12.6 million HYPE tokens alongside $305 million in cash. The company plans to primarily deploy its HYPE tokens through staking initiatives, which are expected to produce ongoing returns. It also plans to explore other decentralized finance activities within the ecosystem, subject to internal evaluations. Hyperliquid Strategies’ latest filing states that the company intends to selectively utilize its HYPE token holdings to generate value for shareholders and strengthen its position in the crypto market. 2025 Milestones Hyperliquid’s ecosystem saw tremendous success this year. It has managed to assert dominance both in token repurchases and blockchain activity. According to CoinGecko, the platform has led token buybacks after allocating over $644.64 million through its Assistance Fund, which is nearly half of all token buyback spending this year. This effort, surpassing the combined buybacks of the next nine largest projects, has led to the repurchase of at least 21.36 million HYPE tokens, which represent roughly 2.1% of total supply. Monthly buybacks averaged $65.50 million and peaked at $110.62 million in August, with an average price of $30.18 per token. On the blockchain side of things, Hyperliquid has surged ahead of traditional networks. Data from CryptoRank shows the network’s fees jumped 1,600% in a year, as it climbed from $2.4 million in October 2024 to $41 million in October 2025. This surge was fueled by the HIP-3 launch, which enabled permissionless perpetuals and strategic fee reductions that drove record trading volumes. On the other hand, Ethereum and Solana experienced significant declines, while Bitcoin’s on-chain fees plummeted 73% during the same period.

53533634,612430,1761214039,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53533634.jpeg,Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) $24.6M Presale Surges as FOMO Draws in Investors,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hyper-presale-24m-surges/,"Quick Facts: 1⃣ Bitcoin Hyper’s presale reaches $24.6M as investors feel the FOMO moving into Q4.2⃣ As Bitcoin’s upcoming Layer-2 solution, Hyper promises faster and cheaper transactions for a more performant and scalable Bitcoin ecosystem.3⃣ $HYPER has a projected release window of between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026, depending on market conditions and demand.4⃣ Whales are making a presale splash, signaling strong investor interest. Bitcoin Hyper’s presale has reached $24.6M+ and it’s growing fast, following a FOMO-driven surge in investors. But what’s drawing everyone to Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) ? Bitcoin Hyper is the Layer-2 that promises to upgrade the Bitcoin ecosystem to Solana-grade numbers, removing the fee-based priority system, and allowing for faster and cheaper transactions. In turn, this will make the network more scalable, which is likely to bring in more institutional and retail users, and catapult the ecosystem into the mainstream. This would be a much-needed change to a network choked by its performance cap of seven transactions per second (TPS) – the reason why Bitcoin currently ranks a dismal 23rd in terms of blockchain performance. So, how exactly will Hyper change Bitcoin’s biggest pain points? Bitcoin’s Problem and Why TPS Matters The TPS cap is responsible for several problems within the Bitcoin environment, the most obvious one being the long confirmation queues, increasing finality times to hours during high-traffic periods. Naturally, the free market found a workaround in the form of the fee-based priority system. Essentially, since users compete for limited block space, miners started prioritizing larger transactions with higher fees, leaving the smaller and cheaper ones at the bottom. During high-traffic windows, small transactions can take hours to go through, which explains why the network hasn’t yet penetrated the mainstream. According to data from Ethereum Foundation, Ethereum is the largest ecosystem for active developers in 2025. Solana is second and Bitcoin comes third . And it’s not even close, as Ethereum outweighs Bitcoin by a factor of 3:1. Chainspect’s data looks even grimmer, with Solana leading the list and Bitcoin sitting at the 11th spot in terms of crypto dev activity in 2025. The conclusion is obvious: the limited TPS bottlenecks the network, such that Bitcoin transactions take longer and are, therefore, more expensive than they need to be. The Lightning Network was one of the first serious attempts at correcting the problem, focusing primarily on transaction speed, which would’ve inadvertently reduced costs as well. Unfortunately, it failed to achieve its goals. The reasons were multiple, including bugs, routing failures due to insufficient liquidity and channel imbalances, and even security problems. Then there’s the fact that the network’s fees are route-dependent , which often leads to errors like failed payments or, even worse, overpayments. Other Layer-2s failed for reasons of their own. The Liquid Network, for instance, did increase transaction speed, but relied on a more centralized model, which increased risks of censorship. Fractal Bitcoin failed due to requiring miners to devote their hashing power to Fractal instead of Bitcoin, essentially encouraging them to leave the Bitcoin network . SatoshiVM promised massive scalability and improved security, but its Bool Network bridge was managed and upgradeable by a single account, which introduced massive centralization and posed extreme security risks. It was time for something new – and that’s how Bitcoin Hyper came to be. How Bitcoin Hyper Works Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) aims to make Bitcoin faster, cheaper, more scalable, and more performant across the board. To that end, the project will rely on tools like Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) and the Canonical Bridge to speed up execution and transaction times – and keep costs low. The SVM will address the same problem Rootstock attempts to: Bitcoin’s lagging smart contract execution. Unlike Rootstock, though, the SVM has already proven its capabilities in the Solana ecosystem, showcasing a TPS in the thousands. The SVM is a direct competitor to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), built specifically for high throughput and increased agility, allowing for the ultra-fast execution of DeFi apps and smart contracts. The Canonical Bridge, on the other hand, will address Bitcoin’s capped TPS by bridging the Hyper and Bitcoin ecosystems. This will allow the Canonical Bridge to mint your Bitcoins directly onto the Hyper layer, as soon as the Bitcoin Relay Program confirms the transaction details. Your wrapped bitcoins will be available for use within the Hyper layer, or until you decide to withdraw them back to Bitcoin’s Layer-1. Together with SVM, the Canonical Bridge eliminates the fee-based priority system, reduces transaction times to seconds, and lowers transaction costs considerably. If implemented successfully, Bitcoin Hyper could transform Bitcoin into an ultra-performant network with near-instant finality and vastly increased scalability. This would catapult the ecosystem at the forefront of the adoption scale and welcome larger institutional investors. Until that happens, though, Hyper first needs to complete its presale – and things are looking good. Should You Invest in Bitcoin Hyper’s Presale? The Bitcoin Hyper’s ($HYPER) presale reached $24.6M+ in just a few months after its launch, making it one of the best crypto presales of 2025 . That’s thanks – in part – to a significant amount of whale activity. We’re talking the likes of $379.9K , $274K , and $180.6K whale buys, among many others. That right there shows strong investor interest in this project’s utility-packed proposal. $HYPER is selling at the presale price of $0.013155 right now and comes with a dynamic staking APY of 48%. Our step-by-step guide to buying Bitcoin Hyper can help get you started if you’re thinking of joining the presale. On that note, if you want to invest, now may be the right time, given that the market is preparing for a bullish November. Moreover, $HYPER targets a release window between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026, depending on the ‘prevailing market conditions and demand’. Based on the presale’s momentum, long-term potential, and investor participation, we expect $HYPER to rally once the post-launch cash-in fever has died out. Our price prediction for $HYPER is a potential $1.50 by 2030, which would reward you with an 11,302% ROI if you bought your tokens at today’s price. Bear in mind, though, that presale prices go up in stages, while the staking APY lowers as more holders stake their tokens. And with the next price increase expected by tomorrow, the clock is ticking. Join the $HYPER presale before the next price hike. Disclaimer: This isn’t financial advice.

Price action remains choppy and indecisive, with the bulls trying to hold the key support levels while the broader market sentiment leans defensive. Macro support zones remain intact for now, but the recent drop in bullish momentum is clearly visible in both price structure and RSI behaviour. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart The daily structure shows that ETH has broken below its ascending parallel channel and recently lost the momentum that carried it above $4,400. After failing to hold the lower trendline and the 100-day moving average, located around the $4,100 mark, the asset is now hovering just above the $3,500 support zone. The RSI is also stuck below 50, suggesting that strength is still lacking. If the buyers fail to protect this area, a move toward the 200-day moving average around $3,200 level, and even the $3,000 demand zone is likely. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH has formed a symmetrical triangle right below the key supply zone around $4,200. The asset has broken below the triangle and is testing its lower bound again. Breakouts from this pattern typically lead to volatility spikes, especially if the price gets rejected from the lower trendline of the channel. A break back above $4,000 could push the price toward the $4,600 resistance, while a breakdown would bring the $3,500 level into play. Moreover, the RSI is recovering slightly but hasn’t signalled a strong breakout yet, keeping the short-term outlook neutral. On-Chain Analysis Exchange Netflow Ethereum’s netflow data paints a cautious picture. The majority of days over the last few weeks have shown strong outflows from exchanges, suggesting holders prefer to keep ETH in private wallets rather than preparing to sell. However, this hasn’t translated into strong price continuation yet, implying accumulation may be happening during consolidation. As long as the outflows continue and panic inflows don’t spike, downside pressure remains limited.

The investment firm’s ARK Innovation ETF and ARK Next Generation Internet ETF collectively acquired 167,489 Robinhood shares. Based on Robinhood’s closing price of $127.22 per share, the total purchase is valued at roughly $21.3 million. Institutional sentiment toward Robinhood has been notably bullish in recent weeks, with options data from Nasdaq showing about 60% bullish activity on the stock. Investors hope for strong results in the company’s upcoming earnings report scheduled for November 5. Moreover, economists expect Robinhood to post earnings of 51 cents per share and revenue of $1.19 billion for the quarter. Cathie Wood’s Ark seeks to buff portfolio with trending stocks The latest purchase by Cathie Wood’s investment firm expands its exposure to crypto and traditional financial companies operating at an intersection. Over the past year, Ark Invest has been increasing holdings in Robinhood, crypto exchange Bullish, Coinbase, and Ethereum treasury firm BitMine. Ark’s ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) currently holds 1,165,397 shares of Bullish, valued at approximately $73.85 million, according to its most recent disclosure. Cryptopolitan reported on August 19 that the financial firm added 356,346 Bullish shares to the ETF on August 19, in a purchase worth about $21.2 million when the stock closed at $59.51. The addition followed earlier allocations of more than 2.5 million Bullish shares across three Ark ETFs on the day of Bullish’s market debut. Alongside the Robinhood and Bullish purchases, Ark Invest made several adjustments through its ETFs this week. The ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) acquired 15,756 shares of Netflix, valued at roughly $17.6 million based on the streaming giant’s closing price of $1,116.37. However, Cathie Wood’s company ETFs sold 44,909 shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a transaction worth about $10.3 million, and offloaded 23,768 shares of Palantir Technologies, valued at around $4.2 million. Ark Invest also reduced a combined 111,849 shares of Roblox Corporation, with 63,870 shares sold from ARKK and 47,979 from ARKW. Additionally, it shed 55,255 shares of Roku Inc., and 32,274 shares of Shopify Inc. across both funds. The Florida-based investment service provider might be drawn towards innovation-driven companies, but it currently appears to be rotating capital toward stocks it feels have a greater upside potential in the medium term. Robinhood extends crypto footprint with acquisitions The increased investment by Ark Invest is on the backdrop of Robinhood’s hunger to dip its foot in the global crypto market. In May, the brokerage acquired Toronto-based WonderFi for roughly $180 million to establish a foothold in the Canadian digital asset space. A month later, Robinhood finalized its $200 million all-cash acquisition of Bitstamp, one of the world’s oldest crypto exchanges. The deal, which was initially announced in 2024, gives Robinhood access to more than 50 active crypto licenses in Europe, the United Kingdom, and Asia. “For us, it’s combining the strengths of the two businesses,” Johann Kerbrat, General Manager of Robinhood Crypto, told CNBC. “We are one of the largest retail marketplaces in the US. They have products that we don’t have, like order books, crypto as a service, advanced API, and lending and staking. Thanks to that, we will be able to get into this space without starting from scratch.” Robinhood has also announced plans to develop its own Layer 2 blockchain built on the Arbitrum network to improve transaction efficiency and scalability for its users, while also placing the company as part of the most active TradFi entities in blockchain technology. According to Google Finance data , Robinhood Markets Inc. closed Wednesday at $127.22, up 3.5% on the day, although it is still down 4.62% from recent highs.

This conviction from institutional investors comes as Ethereum retests a pivotal level around $4,000—a former resistance zone that must now hold as support to sustain the uptrend. Analysts highlight its importance. Popular pseudonymous X analyst EtherWizz noted , “As long as Ethereum holds this support zone, there’s no reason to be bearish.” ETH / USD 1-day chart, bull flag pattern. Source: TradingView. A successful bounce here would confirm strong structural support at higher levels, and a potential launchpad for a breakout from a two-month bull flag pattern. Momentum indicators, however, hang in the balance. The RSI is drifting toward neutral, while the MACD forms a narrow but widening gap below the signal line—both hinting at growing sell pressure. A short-term pullback toward $3,700–$3,800 could be the next move without a near-term catalyst. The U.S. interest rate cut decision next week could be pivotal. If the pattern fully materializes, Ethereum could see a 105% move to $8,000, a credible scenario as continued U.S. interest rate easing fuels renewed appetite for risk assets heading into 2026.

While Bitcoin’s dominance has surged, altcoins like XRP are struggling to hold critical support levels. However, the charts still show some structure holding for now. Technical Analysis By Shayan The USDT Pair On the USDT chart, XRP has pulled back from the upper boundary of its broad ascending channel and is now testing the lower trendline. The asset is currently positioned just below the 100-day and 200-day moving averages, with the latter serving as immediate resistance at around $2.60. A break below the lower boundary of the channel could expose the $2 demand zone. With the RSI also hovering around 40, the momentum is bearish but not oversold, suggesting more room for downside if support fails. The BTC Pair Looking at the BTC pair, the situation appears weaker. XRP has broken below the long-standing support around 2,500 SAT and is struggling to reclaim the 200-day MA. After a sharp drop to the 2,000 area, the price has found temporary stability but still trades below key resistance levels. The RSI also remains stuck near 39, showing that relative strength is lacking compared to Bitcoin. Therefore, the buyers need to reclaim the 2,500 zone soon to regain momentum. Otherwise, XRP is likely to continue its decline against BTC.

Binance to Support Shentu (CTK) Network Upgrade and Hard Fork The company announced that it will temporarily suspend token deposits and withdrawals on the CTK network at 20:00 on October 24, 2025, to ensure users' asset security. According to Binance's statement, the network upgrade and hard fork will occur at block height 26,267,300. The upgrade is expected to be completed around 9:00 PM on October 24, 2025. Operations will be reactivated once the network's stability is verified, and users will not need to take any additional action during this period. Shentu (formerly CertiK Chain) is known as a project focused on improving blockchain security. The project aims to provide on-chain security audits for smart contracts and decentralized security solutions. This upgrade is expected to include various technical improvements aimed at improving network performance and transaction security. Binance warned users to carefully follow announcements before making any transactions to protect themselves from potential risks. While CTK transactions will be suspended during the network upgrade, token trading will continue unaffected. *This is not investment advice.

The SNB’s officials shared, “The full impact of the monetary policy easing in past quarters will only take effect with a lag. In light of the weak inflationary pressure and the slight deterioration in the economic outlook, the bank’s expansionary monetary policy is contributing to a rise in inflation.” Swiss National Bank Chairman Martin Schlegel says the state’s inflation is likely to rise slightly in the coming quarters, with economic indicators pointing to a stable situation with moderate growth. According to slides prepared for an SNB event in Belp, central Switzerland, Schlegel said uncertainty remains high. He noted that with the announced but currently suspended US tariffs on certain pharmaceutical products, the downside risks could rise. SNB believes the effect of US tariffs is manageable At their last meeting, on September 25, officials at the SNB opted to maintain interest rates , believing the current policy is strong enough to boost inflation in the months ahead. The central bank explained that its September decision to stop cutting rates and maintain zero borrowing costs reflected a view that US tariffs on Switzerland were not overly disruptive. Despite relatively high levels of uncertainty, policymakers noted that the country’s economy was showing moderate growth. Gero Jung, head of investment strategy at Banque Cantonale du Valais, noted that the need for potential further monetary easing was judged as not being “appropriate” at the current juncture. He continued to say that in the absence of major shocks, the current status quo of a zero policy rate remains the most likely scenario. Alexandro Bee, an economist at UBS in Zurich, noted that they saw little new information in the paper but did find a few points of interest. He pointed to the lack of alternative scenarios — for example, one in which negative interest rates were implemented — as particularly telling. The SNB probably also avoided delivering any surprises in the summary, which is why it had fewer details than minutes published by other central banks, Bee said. Since the US announced the tariffs, SNB officials have appeared to downplay concerns about the 39% rate, which is significantly higher than the rates faced by other countries. However, analysts have started revising their forecasts. The government even lowered its growth estimate for 2026 from 1.2% to 0.9%, citing the import levies. According to reports, inflation rose to 0.2% in September, but officials anticipate a moderate increase soon. Swiss government will release summary after interest rate decision The summary the bank released is the first of its kind, following Schlegel’s push for greater transparency, similar to that of other advanced economies, such as the US. According to the Swiss government, such a summary will be unveiled four weeks following each interest-rate decision. Analysts have also noted that the measure provides the central bank with a new avenue to influence markets amid ongoing efforts to slow franc inflows, even as the currency approaches its strongest point against the euro in ten years. On the other hand, some UBS economists hinted on Wednesday that the Swiss National Bank is likely stepping in to curb the franc’s appreciation. In their summary, policymakers, however, made only brief remarks on the franc. They commented, “Geopolitical shocks could lead to money flowing into currency areas regarded as safe havens by investors. This could result in an appreciation of the Swiss franc. This risk is currently being countered somewhat by the relatively high interest-rate differential.” Nonetheless, the Swiss government had clarified earlier that i t is not the aim of this summary to inform about individual members’ opinions and considerations, adding that it will attempt to summarize only “the most important elements” of discussions in the governing board to make them comprehensible to everyone. Unlike their counterparts, Schlegel said they will not share all information.

The license allows Revolut to operate under a unified regulatory framework, granting access to 30 European markets and strengthening its foothold in the digital asset sector. “This authorisation enables us to deliver groundbreaking crypto products with enhanced transparency and trust for our growing customer base, while further reiterating our commitment to crypto as an asset class,” said Costas Michael, CEO of Revolut Digital Assets Europe. Revolut Expands Crypto Ambitions The move marks a significant step in Revolut’s expansion strategy as it prepares to launch its “Crypto 2.0” platform, designed to enhance trading, staking, and stablecoin services for users. Revolut, which has more than 65 million customers worldwide — including 40 million in Europe — said the license would help it scale its crypto offerings under MiCA’s investor protection and compliance standards. The fintech’s upcoming platform, Crypto 2.0, will feature access to more than 280 tokens, zero-fee staking with yields up to 22% annual percentage yield, and instant 1:1 stablecoin-to-dollar conversions without spreads. Introducing Crypto 2.0 and Revolut X Revolut said Crypto 2.0 would integrate seamlessly with its Visa and Mastercard crypto-enabled cards and Revolut X exchange, offering low trading fees between 0.00% and 0.09%. The company aims to provide one of the broadest crypto experiences in Europe by combining on/off-ramping tools with transparent pricing and advanced security measures. Revolut X, launched last year as a dedicated desktop trading platform, supports over 100 tokens and is now available in 30 EEA markets with mobile access via iOS and Android. The company said Revolut X has already attracted more than 14 million crypto users globally, underscoring its growing dominance in digital asset services. Looking Ahead to Crypto Derivatives Revolut is reportedly exploring expansion into the crypto derivatives market, targeting institutional clients. A company spokesperson confirmed in June that Revolut is strengthening its crypto division, following reports of plans to enter derivatives trading.

The cryptocurrency has been trading between $0.19 and $0.21 in October and has failed to regain the high it reached at the beginning of the month. Source: CoinMarketCap On October 22, 2025, the digital asset was trading at around $0.19, with a trading range of $0.191 to $0.205. Dogecoin is currently worth almost $29 billion, which guarantees its presence in the list of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, with a circulating supply of 151 billion coins. Supply Wall Creates Selling Pressure On-chain data have shown the reason why the number 0.21 poses such a significant obstacle. This price bought over 10 billion DOGE tokens, which analysts refer to as a supply wall. At this price, a significant number of holders will seek to sell out at breakeven, overwhelming the market with sell orders. Source: X This monopoly of supply has had several unsuccessful attempts to raise prices higher. Every attempt to move towards $0.21 is met with strong resistance, and the prices are brought down. The trend adheres to typical investor psychology in cryptocurrency markets, where traders rush to withdraw their investments when the price reaches the level at which they initially invested in the assets. According to market analysts, the level of support they focus on is $0.194. A fall below this level may prompt quicker selling, up to $0.16 or even $ 0.13. On the other hand, a long-term rise above $0.21 will drive Dogecoin to 0.24-0.26, where it was at the beginning of October. Institutional Interest Grows Despite Volatility Grayscale's launch of a Dogecoin Trust earlier this year has provided institutional investors with regulated access to the cryptocurrency. While the trust does not offer the same benefits as a full exchange-traded fund, it represents progress in legitimizing Dogecoin beyond its origins as a meme-based token. The coin continues to attract merchant adoption as a payment method. However, its uncapped supply remains a concern. Mining operations add approximately 5 billion DOGE annually, creating constant selling pressure that must be absorbed by demand. Trading volumes across the broader cryptocurrency market have declined recently, making it harder to overcome resistance levels. When liquidity decreases, coins like Dogecoin face steeper challenges at key price points. Large holders, commonly referred to as whales, significantly influence price action at these levels through their substantial transactions. Technical analysts view the current range as unsustainable. The coin must either break above $0.21 or fall below $0.194 to establish a new trend. Volume will be critical in confirming any breakout. Strong buying volume accompanying a move above resistance would validate bullish momentum, while weak volume could indicate another false breakout. Source: X When Grayscale introduced the Dogecoin Trust earlier this year, it provided institutional investors with regulated access to the cryptocurrency. Although the trust is not providing the same level of value as a full exchange-traded fund, it is a step toward making Dogecoin more legitimate than a meme-based coin. Merchants are still embracing the coin as a means of payment. Nevertheless, its unlimited supply is still an issue. Mining activities contribute approximately 5 billion DOGE every year, which forms continuous pressure on sales that must be compensated for by increased demand. Volumes in the larger cryptocurrency market have decreased recently, making it challenging to overcome the resistance levels. Coins, such as Dogecoin, experience stiffer challenges at significant price levels when liquidity is reduced. These large holders are often referred to as whales and are capable of significantly influencing the price action at this level due to their substantial transactions. Technical analysts consider that the current range is unsustainable. It will need to break above 0.21 or drop below 0.194 to establish a new trend.

This move echoes its 2020 recovery that propelled it toward record peaks. Analysts have spotted patterns signaling potential climbs to $4,900. This is if supports at $3,400 hold firm. Yet, rejection at $4,000 lingers, with RSI dipping below 50 and MACD in negative territory. Thus hinting at bearish squeezes ahead. Layer-2 expansions have fueled optimism, drawing institutional flows into altcoins amid DeFi's scaling push. Investors have sought the best crypto to buy now, weighing Ethereum's established base against emerging altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This crypto to buy today for long-term debate spotlights ETH's endurance alongside MUTM's structured ascent at $0.035. Phase 6 of MUTM's presale has advanced 75%, raising urgency as funds hit $17,800,000 with 17,380 holders aboard. Such momentum underscores altcoins primed for sustained yields. Ethereum's Echoing Rally Setup Ethereum had traced a familiar path in recent weeks. The move mirroring 2020's base-building after sharp drops. Traders watched as the asset stabilized above $3,400, fending off tests near $3,200. Such sequences had sparked exponential surges before. Now, bulls eyed a push beyond $4,900 to affirm the uptrend's grip. Yet, short-term signals clashed. Sellers dominated at $4,000, stalling advances. Momentum faded as RSI hovered under neutral lines and MACD lines crossed bearishly. A reversal demanded RSI climbs above 50, coupled with MACD flips. Without those, dips threatened deeper retraces. Institutional rotations into altcoins amplified this, though Bitcoin's sway curbed quick rebounds. Ethereum traded as a foundational pick, yet its volatility paled against targeted DeFi plays. Therefore, eyes turned toward fresher altcoins offering layered utilities. Mutuum Finance Presale Accelerates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has surged through Phase 6 of its 11-phase rollout. 75% of allocations claimed at $0.035 per token. This stage has extended rapidly, drawing 17,380 holders since inception and amassing $17,800,000. Prices had climbed 250% from Phase 1's $0.01 entry, rewarding early entrants. Phase 6 sells out swiftly now, closing the window on this rate before Phase 7 hikes it 14.3% to $0.04. Launch beckons at $0.06, projecting 371% gains for current holders post-deployment. The protocol's dual lending framework sets it apart in DeFi. Peer-to-Contract pools channel assets like ETH and USDT into yield-generating reserves, where algorithmic rates balance supply and demand. Borrowers draw collateralized loans, while depositors earn via mtTokens that accrue interest seamlessly. Peer-to-Peer lanes handle niche tokens through direct negotiations, shielding core liquidity from outliers. This blend caters to retail yield hunters and institutional tacticians alike. Security Anchors Protocol Trust Mutuum Finance has fortified its launch with rigorous safeguards. Teams completed a CertiK audit, scoring 90 on Token Scan for contract robustness. Lately, developers unveiled a bug bounty program, partnering with CertiK and allocating $50,000 in USDT rewards. Tiers span critical flaws at top payouts down to low-risk finds, ensuring exhaustive vetting across severities. Version 1 deploys on Sepolia testnet this Q4 2025, testing liquidity pools, debt tokens, and liquidation bots with ETH and USDT starters. Over-collateralized stablecoin plans anchor further, pegged 1:1 to USD via reserve-backed minting. Yields from these feed the treasury, stabilizing operations amid swings. Chainlink oracles underpin pricing, with fallbacks averting errors in liquidations. Community incentives amplify engagement. A $100,000 giveaway distributes $10,000 in MUTM to 10 winners; participants submit wallets, finish quests, and invest at least $50 in presale to qualify. Such draws have swelled the base, positioning MUTM as a DeFi mainstay. Gains Beckon in Dual Markets Ethereum's patterns intrigue, yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) carves sharper edges for long-haul holders. This altcoin thrives on verifiable mechanics, from audited codes to yield loops that redistribute fees via token buys. As Phase 6 nears exhaustion, securing MUTM at $0.035 locks in outsized returns versus ETH's broader drifts. The best crypto to buy now favors utility-driven ascents. Which crypto to buy today for long-term? MUTM's layered lending and stable anchors deliver resilience. Act on this entry; allocate thoughtfully to capture the protocol's unfolding momentum.

This rebound is reminiscent of its 2020 upswing which eventually led to peak values. Market analysts suggest that if Ethereum can maintain support above $3,400, it might climb towards $4,900. Despite Ethereum's potential, it faces immediate challenges as rejection levels near $4,000 persist, with key technical indicators like the RSI and MACD suggesting possible bearish trends. On the other hand, the expansion of Layer-2 solutions and increasing institutional interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) are positives that could bolster its position. In the realm of emerging altcoins, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has been creating waves, especially with its impressive performance in the ongoing presale of its token priced at $0.035. The project has successfully engaged over 17,380 holders and raised $17,800,000 up to its sixth phase, indicating robust market trust and investor interest. Ethereum and Market Dynamics As Ethereum manages to hold its ground above $3,400, there's cautious optimism about its short to medium-term price movements. However, the crypto market's volatility, influenced by factors like Bitcoin's performance and broader economic indicators, continues to pose risks. On a more strategic level, Ethereum's role in DeFi and the incremental adoption of its Layer-2 technologies suggest a bright long-term future. These advancements are crucial as they reduce transaction fees and enhance scalability, making Ethereum a more attractive platform for developers and investors alike. Mutuum Finance's Strategic Market Position As Phase 6 of its presale progresses, Mutuum Finance is not just another altcoin but a potential pioneer in the DeFi landscape. Its token price trajectory from $0.01 in Phase 1 to the current $0.035 represents a substantial increase, showcasing strong market reception and potential for future gains. Mutuum's innovative dual lending system, combining Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer frameworks, allows it to diversify its offerings and cater to both retail and institutional investors. This model supports a sustainable ecosystem where users can earn interest through mtTokens or engage directly with other users for personalized lending terms. Security and Community Growth Mutuum Finance emphasizes security as a cornerstone of its platform, demonstrated by a comprehensive audit by CertiK and the introduction of a bug bounty program to incentivize community participation in platform security. Such initiatives not only build trust but also enhance the overall stability of the protocol. The community is also actively engaged through incentives like a $100,000 giveaway , which helps in maintaining investor interest and broadening the user base. Conclusion: Which Crypto to Buy? The choice between established cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and new entrants like Mutuum Finance depends largely on individual investment strategies and risk tolerance. Ethereum offers stability and a proven track record, while Mutuum provides high growth potential and innovative DeFi solutions. Both options present viable opportunities for different types of investors seeking to diversify their digital asset portfolios.

The round was entirely community-led, with no venture capital firms involved, implying strong early adoption potential, as per the information shared with Finbold prior to the announcement. Having debuted during the Rare EVO 2025 event in August, Technotainment plans to use the newly raised funds to improve its engineering, onboard new creators, and work on new integrations to make content more accessible. “From day one, we set out to bring Hollywood on-chain and build a streaming ecosystem where everyone wins. A community-only raise is a powerful signal: the people who will use and build on Technotainment are the ones funding it. This is what Streaming 2.0 looks like,” Nyhl Henson, Founder and CEO of Technotainment, told Finbold. However, some funds will be allocated to the so-called Technotainment Art & Media Institutes, which serve as decentralized production hubs established in partnership with various university partners to ensure more affordable testing. Commerce-enabled streaming Envisioned as a stepping stone toward a proprietary layer-1 ( L1 ) chain, Technotainment offers real-time interactivity and commerce-enabled streams with other functionalities such as live polls, watch parties, one-click merch, etc. The machinery behind it is supported by the soon-to-be-released, MiCA-aligned, CAST token, which is also designed to reward viewers and creators based on their participation and contribution to the ecosystem. “Streaming is unfinished. Audiences want to get involved, creators deserve to earn much more share, and brands don’t want impressions; they want outcomes. Technotainment unites these incentives in one experience and rewards the actions that actually grow culture,” added Wesley Ellul, President & Head of Strategy of Technotainment. Furthermore, the capital will be spent to scale technology capabilities across TV, mobile, and web, as well as to deepen the platform’s interactivity features. A platform beta and Streaming 2.0 features are set to launch this quarter, while a token generation event is scheduled for somewhere between late Q4 2025 and early Q1 2026. As a testament to its creator-first ethos, Technotainment is proudly championing “ Delightful Droid’s Journey ,” a 16-minute animated short that celebrates curiosity, empathy, and cultural diversity through the adventures of an endearing AI hero in Mystic Village.

The partnership was announced on October 23, with the two parties sharing the details directly with Finbold ahead of the public release. At the heart of this collaboration are MadRims, AI-powered glasses built on the PlayAI Network and designed to make the physical world as interactive as the internet. More precisely, the device can translate natural language commands into executable digital actions to bring on-chain automation to the user’s environment. Next-gen AI and robotics As part of the deal, PlayAI will feed MadRims’ decentralized vision data into Hub’s real-time infrastructure. In turn, Hub will handle labeling, annotation, and quality assurance to translate raw images into verifiable datasets. Ultimately, those datasets will become a tradeable asset for training large models in fields like robotics , finance , and autonomous systems, giving developers and contributors a new co-monetization model to work with. “By bringing MadRims vision data into Hub and streaming it back out as structured, verifiable feeds, we’re delivering the rails enterprises need for next-gen AI and robotics, ” Tim Sprecher, Co-founder and COO of Hub.xyz, told Finbold. Moreover, PlayAI’s agentic workflows will also operate on Hub’s low-latency pipelines. Accordingly, agents will be able to react instantly to live behavioral, financial, or threat signals. This live intelligence could thus enhance trading algorithms down the line, finding additional use cases in areas such as news analysis. “Decentralized living” Beyond technological innovation, the collaboration seeks to illustrate what the two partners call “decentralized living.” This concept entails a confluence of identity, access, and automation, all working seamlessly across applications free from centralized control. Simply put, Hub’s infrastructure will allow users to authenticate, execute tasks, and connect across digital ecosystems while preserving privacy and sovereignty. “PlayAI’s mission is to orchestrate crypto x AI. Integrating Hub’s real-time streams lets our agents act on fresh signals, while our MadRims network supplies frontier data that models actually need,” added Ramees, Founder and CEO of PlayAI. On the other end, PlayAI hopes to reach the status of the “Zapier of on-chain AI” and help users automate real-world tasks via simple prompts. Finally, equipped with a 12-megapixel camera, open-ear speakers, voice activation functionalities, and modular shades, MadRims became available for preorder in September for $49 (full price: $249), with 1,000 Founder’s Editions available.

The remarks, delivered in a mid-week client note and shared by The Block, frame a tactical pullback inside a still-intact macro bull thesis the bank has championed for months. Last-Ever Bitcoin Dip Under $100,000 Ahead Kendrick’s message juxtaposes near-term caution with longer-term conviction. In the same research cycle where Standard Chartered reiterated a target of $200,000 by year-end—hinging on ETF demand, corporate treasury uptake, and a friendlier policy backdrop—the strategist has now flagged an air-pocket toward sub-$100,000 as the market digests October’s sell-off and a tepid bounce. “A decline below $100,000 now appears ‘inevitable,’” Kendrick said on Wednesday, while stressing that any dip should be short-lived and likely the “last-ever chance to buy BTC for less than six figures.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Cycle Top Still Not In, Suggests NVT Golden Cross The recalibration follows an early-October swing that saw bitcoin fail to hold above its recent local high—Kendrick cited the Oct. 10 risk-off break and the absence of a strong reflex rally—shifting the bank’s focus to where the market bottoms rather than whether it immediately resumes trend. In the latest note, Kendrick pointed to a handful of signposts for a base-building phase, including monitoring capital rotation between gold and bitcoin and the trajectory of US dollar liquidity and quantitative tightening. He also observed that bitcoin has respected its 50-week moving average since early 2023, a level he views as an important longer-duration line in the sand. The near-term crosscurrents complicate, but do not upend, Standard Chartered’s cycle map. As recently as July 2, the bank told clients it expected the largest dollar rally on record in the second half of 2025, with bitcoin at $200,000 by Dec. 31. That framing—ETF inflows, corporate balance-sheet adoption, and regulatory normalization as the dominant drivers—remains the core of Kendrick’s upside case, even as he concedes that a brief trip under $100,000 is now probable. “The decline could mark the last time to ever buy BTC for six figures,” the latest dispatch emphasized. Related Reading: Bitcoin Could Crash 50%, Pushing MSTR ‘Underwater,’ Legendary Trader Warns Market context is aligned with the cautionary near-term tone. Over the past two weeks, bitcoin has shed roughly ten percent, with spot trading today around $108,000 as liquidity thins into the weekend and macro sensitivity to policy headlines remains elevated. What matters from here is whether the confirmation signals Kendrick highlighted begin to line up. A decisive improvement in dollar liquidity conditions, sustained evidence of rotation back into bitcoin at the expense of gold, and preservation of higher-timeframe trend structures would validate the “last time below $100,000” claim. Absent those, a deeper retracement cannot be ruled out, but that scenario would represent a deviation from the bank’s published roadmap rather than its base case. For now, Standard Chartered’s message is unambiguous: brace for a dip under six figures, but treat it—quoting Kendrick directly—as “the last-ever chance to buy BTC for less than six figures,” provided the medium-term catalysts reassert. At press time, BTC traded at $109,953.

Spare Key With Every Nano Ledger Recovery Key will be included in every Nano Gen5 box. In July this year, Ledger released its Ledger Recovery Key , a spare key for users to access digital assets. First announced in late June 2025, the product allows Ledger Flex and Ledger Stax users to create a spare key alongside the 24 words. The spare key connects directly to the wallet via NFC wireless channels. It’s kept on hardware and is protected by its own PIN code. Now, per the latest announcement, “NFC support further enables Ledger Security Key, allowing you to use FIDO2 Passkeys to protect your logins using your Ledger signer.” Here's a reminder of everything that’s happened at Ledger between our last Ledger Op3n in December 2022 and now: – Ledger Stax released – Ledger Flex released, along with Ledger Flex Bitcoin and Solana Editions – Clear Signing Initiative and Transaction Check launched, ensuring… — Ledger (@Ledger) October 23, 2025 Meanwhile, Susan Kare, the artist and graphic designer behind the Apple Macintosh’s original iconography, has designed iconography for an exclusive series of Badges to personalize Ledger Nano.

The analyst stated that the SEC’s live televised comments effectively served as an acknowledgment of Bitcoin’s regulatory acceptance in the United States. He suggested that such a statement, coming from the primary securities regulator, marks a new phase in the evolution of cryptocurrency oversight. They’ll say it’s a theory… until THE SEC JUST SLIPPED — AND ACCIDENTALLY CONFIRMED THE XRP MASTER PLAN hits. pic.twitter.com/si1S7GIwuR — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 20, 2025 Implications of a Bitcoin Endorsement In the video, Ripple Bull Winkle noted that after years of uncertainty surrounding digital assets, the SEC’s recognition of Bitcoin could create a model for how other cryptocurrencies are viewed within U.S. regulatory frameworks. The analyst emphasized that the approval of Bitcoin by regulators could serve as an entry point for broader institutional participation. Once institutional investors understand the structure and compliance framework around Bitcoin, he argued, they are likely to explore other digital assets that meet similar criteria. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 XRP Positioned as a Beneficiary The analyst went further by identifying XRP as the digital asset best positioned to benefit from this development. He argued that XRP, unlike most cryptocurrencies, already holds a level of regulatory clarity within the U.S. following recent legal outcomes . According to his interpretation, this clarity uniquely positions XRP to attract capital once institutions start to expand their exposure beyond Bitcoin. He stated that central banks and sovereign wealth funds could interpret the SEC’s statement as a signal that digital assets are entering a new phase of legitimacy, thereby allowing large-scale capital movements into assets with clearly defined legal standing. The analyst framed the moment as an indication that a structural shift within the regulatory landscape is underway, suggesting that the groundwork is being laid for institutional adoption of select cryptocurrencies. While his assessment remains speculative, it highlights a growing sentiment that regulatory clarity, once isolated to Bitcoin, could soon shape the trajectory of the broader digital asset ecosystem.

The platform, mixing a native DEX with aggregation and other services, is one of the most widely used on Solana. Jupiter achieved $46M in revenues for Q3, securing a regular source of inflows without additional external funding. The app has become sustainable, as one of the go-to services for token trading on Solana. It saw 8.4M active wallets for the past quarter, up from 8M for Q2. Jupiter achieved a higher baseline of fees in Q3, underscoring its revenues. Perpetual futures were the biggest factor for Q3 revenues, adding $24.6M to the bottom line. The protocol draws in $1.38B in annualized fees, remaining the top Solana app. Jupiter improved its revenue flows from multiple activities, based on its new products turning it into a Solana super-app. | Source: Jupiter Q3 report As of October 23, Jupiter produced $4.1M in fees. The app achieved $176.8B in spot trading volumes for Q3, coinciding with demand for trading meme tokens. Jupiter expanded with perpetual futures trading, a trend which accelerated into Q4. The platform is also among the top 5 fee producer apps, getting close to Hyperliquid’s daily fees. While Jupiter’s team has focused on building, the regular revenues were also presented as evidence of the project’s adoption. Jupiter’s team touted the robust revenues as proof that the app had built a sustainable model and did not need new funding sources or raises . In its recent quarterly report, the Jupiter team saw significant upside for DeFi activity, as it attempted to catch up with centralized crypto markets. The platform expects DeFi users to grow by a factor of 10 in the coming months and years, tapping a larger share of traders. Jupiter’s JUP token trades near a three-month low Despite Jupiter’s sustainable earnings, its native token continues to slide. Ongoing unlocks and the selling of rewards are pressuring JUP. JUP did not reflect the successful revenues of the Jupiter app. The team announced it would try to boost the roles for the token, with the goal of ending the long-term slide. | Source: Coingecko As of October 23, JUP traded at around $0.35, near a three-month low. Based on the current market moves, JUP is considered potentially undervalued, compared to Jupiter’s activity and demand. The Jupiter team also stated it would change its approach to the JUP token . The usage of JUP for voting on minor issues will diminish, and holders will only vote on critical issues. The team aims to integrate JUP into Jupiter’s activity, potentially boosting the price and revenue-sharing potential of the token. Jupiter expands as a Solana superapp Jupiter has grown from a trading and routing aggregator to its goal of becoming a “superapp”. The project secured validator status with Solana, becoming the third-biggest validator. The project now locks in $3.28B in total value locked, coming from DEX liquidity and its newly launched lending business. As a validator, Jupiter locks in over $1B, seeing $531.4K revenues from JupSOL. The inflows go toward Jupiter’s DAO reserves. In Q3, Jupiter also added a launchpad for tokens, posting over 34K launched tokens and $1.32B in trading volumes.

The purchase, worth roughly $9 million, brings Quantum Solutions’ total holdings to about 3,866 ETH, valued at $14.8 million. Ethereum as the Core of Quantum’s Strategy Ethereum is at the centre of Quantum Solutions’ digital asset strategy. According to its latest statement, the company intends to keep accumulating Ethereum to diversify its holdings and reinforce its balance sheet. “Ethereum is the primary focus of our digital asset strategy,” Quantum Solutions said in its official announcement. “We will continue to build our reserves as we expand in the blockchain and digital asset sectors.” The company’s rising confidence in ETH shows a trend among Asian corporations that have been integrating crypto into their financial structures. Publicly listed firms in Japan are showing greater interest in blockchain-based assets, even as markets in Hong Kong, India, and Australia tighten regulations on digital asset treasuries. ARK Invest Strengthens Its Bet on Ethereum ARK Invest, led by Cathie Wood was one of the firms that supported Quantum Solutions’ recent $180 million fundraising round in September. The funding aims to help the company build a 100,000 ETH treasury and advance its presence in the digital asset market. Quantum Solutions is backed by Cathie Wood and Ark Invest | source: X Wood described Quantum Solutions as Japan’s first institutional-grade Ethereum digital asset treasury. She further mentioned that ARK Invest is excited to back such innovation in the region. ARK also recently invested in BitMine , the world’s largest Ether DAT and this collaboration strengthens the link between traditional investment firms and digital asset companies. How the Ethereum Accumulation Was Funded Quantum Solutions’ Hong Kong subsidiary, GPT Pals Studio, led the latest round of ETH purchases. The company financed the purchase using a mix of external borrowings and proceeds from financial instruments like convertible bonds and stock acquisition rights. Quantum Solutions currently holds 11.6 BTC worth around $1.3 million. This is a smaller portion of its overall treasury, and the company says the focus will remain on Ethereum because of its importance to defi and tokenisation. DAT Market Shows Mixed Performance The digital asset treasury (DAT) market around the world has cooled slightly after months of excitement. Share prices of some large crypto-holding firms have slipped, and are leading to questions about whether the DAT boom is slowing down. Tom Lee, who chairs BitMine, recently questioned if the “DAT bubble” had popped. However, he has also been buying aggressively after recent market dips. This means that he has continued faith in the long-term value of this market. Quantum Solutions seems to share that confidence.

The token’s ability to recover above the $0.00001 mark has brought temporary relief to investors, even as selling pressure and bearish technical signals continue to weigh on its outlook. Shiba Inu’s Swift Rebound After Sharp Drop October began with optimism for Shiba Inu and the wider crypto market, as several assets rallied strongly in what traders called “Uptober.” The upward momentum fueled hopes for a sustained market recovery. However, those expectations faded quickly following the renewed trade tensions between China and the United States on October 10. The escalating trade war triggered a widespread sell-off across digital assets, dragging Shiba Inu from around $0.000012 to $0.000007448. That drop temporarily added a fifth zero to its price for the first time in over a year. The meme-based cryptocurrency quickly erased that loss, surging to a daily high of $0.00001072 on October 11. Since then, Shiba Inu has managed to hover near the $0.00001 threshold, occasionally slipping below it but rebounding soon after. This resilience has given the Shiba Inu community a sense of psychological victory, viewing the token’s ability to maintain four zeros as a sign of underlying strength despite persistent market uncertainty. On October 21, the token staged another recovery, rising from about $0.000009876 to $0.00001055. At the time of writing, the token trades at around $0.00001003, up 1.54% in the last 24 hours. Still, its current price remains far below the December high of $0.00003329, a decline of nearly 70%. Exchange Activity and Bearish Technical Signals While the price has shown resilience, growing caution among investors. Between October 20 and 22, Shiba Inu’s exchange reserves increased from 82.09 trillion to 82.14 trillion SHIB, according to market data. This uptick signals that more holders are moving tokens to exchanges, often a sign of potential selling intent. Source: SHIB Exchange Reserve A descending triangle has been identified, and a pattern is forming on Shiba Inu’s chart. This structure typically signals bearish continuation and potential downside movement. The triangle’s base, positioned around $0.00001052, has been tested several times since April. Shiba Inu 1-day price chart, Source: TradingView If that support level fails, the token could drop as low as $0.000006.

Turkey surged to the top of crypto transaction volumes in region, followed by the UAE and Egypt among others. Turkey topped the regional index, with nearly $200 billion in annual transactions, four times that of the UAE, which took second place at $53 billion. Just behind the UAE is Egypt, which witnessed around $48 billion of crypto annual transactions, followed by Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Morocco. Top MENA countries by crypto value received. Source: Chainalysis Turkey’s crypto growth due to challenging economic circumstances According to the Chainalysis report, Turkey’s crypto growth stems from its challenging economic circumstances and economic necessity as an alternative financial infrastructure and as a form of investment. Turkey saw $878 billion gross crypto inflows since early 2021, outpacing all other MENA markets . However, there have been some changes. The institutional bracket, which includes both large (exceeding $10 million) and mid-sized transactions ($1 million to $10 million), has seen more modest decelerations in growth. In the retail bracket, professional traders ($10,000 to $1 million) have experienced a decline from 41.6% growth to just 4.1%, a nearly 90% reduction in their growth rate. At the retail end, there has been an even more dramatic reversal in participation, with large retail ($1,000 to $10,000) and small retail (under $1,000) transactions shifting from healthy positive growth to a 1.6% and 2.3% contraction, respectively. Chainalysis interpreted those changes as evidence of reduced disposable income among the retail segment for crypto investment or a shift in sentiment. It also might be a reflection of Turkey’s crypto regulatory framework and stronger alignment with FATF standards . Despite this, a look at the 31-day transactions count on Turkish crypto exchanges showed that in late 2024, there was a surge in altcoin volumes ($50 million), peaking above $250 million by mid-2025. UAE crypto growth slowed in 2024-2025 but still steady While the UAE took second place in the Chainalysis crypto adoption MENA 2025 report, the growth had slowed from 86.4% in the 2023-2024 period to 33% in the 2024-2025 period. Interestingly, while the biggest growth in the UAE is driven by institutional transactions and transfers (54.75%) and (37.2%) respectively, there has been extraordinary growth across the merchant services category in retail segments, with small retail ( UAE period-over-period crypto transaction growth by transfer sizes. Source: Chainalysis This reflects how crypto is entering everyday commercial use cases and practical payments.

Despite months of sluggish trading and persistent bearish sentiment, experts believe the “dead and sleep coin,” as some have called it, could awaken with a powerful late rally that catches many investors off guard. For now, Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades near $0.00000985, down roughly 52% year-to-date and 18% over the past month. But behind the weak price action lies one of the strongest communities in crypto; more than 1.54 million holders continue to show faith in the token’s long-term potential. Analysts see patience paying off Market analyst MMB Trader has emerged as one of the most vocal believers in Shiba Inu’s potential comeback. In his recent analysis on TradingView , he described SHIB as a “dead and sleep coin” that historically moves late but explosively. According to MMB, the current sideways movement is not a sign of weakness but a precursor to a major breakout. Source: MMB Trader on TradingView MMB’s technical analysis identifies a multi-year descending trendline that has been suppressing the Shiba Inu price since its March 2024 peak at $0.00004567. A breakout above this neckline resistance — currently near $0.00001740 — could signal a shift in trend, unleashing what he calls “an impulsive bullish move.” MMB Trader projected that a successful breakout and retest of the trendline could push SHIB toward three key targets: $0.00003364, $0.00005548, and $0.00007730. If achieved, the final target would represent a stunning 670% surge from current levels. Shiba Inu’s growing holders, weak inflows Even as price action remains under pressure, the number of Shiba Inu holders continues to rise steadily. On-chain data shows that the total holder count now exceeds 1.54 million addresses, a sign of resilient long-term interest. SHIB POSSESSOR @SHIBpossessor · Follow $SHIB holders now stand at 1,546,558 on chain holders with a steady growth week after week. Let’s keep building and growing. momentum’s on our side. #SHIB 9:59 pm · 21 Oct 2025 158 Reply Copy link Read 11 replies This is evidence that new investors are entering the ecosystem despite the volatility. However, exchange data paints a more cautious short-term picture. Inflows to exchanges have jumped by more than 56.6 billion SHIB in just 24 hours, according to CryptoQuant . Such movements often hint at potential sell pressure as traders move tokens to exchanges for liquidity. This dynamic has left the token vulnerable around its key $0.00000900 support level. If that floor gives way, SHIB’s prices could slide toward $0.00000800 or even test $0.000006, especially if the descending triangle pattern visible on charts confirms a breakdown. Institutional interest adds optimism While retail investors form the backbone of Shiba Inu’s market strength, institutional exposure may soon add another layer of credibility. T. Rowe Price, a $1.77 trillion asset manager, has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to launch an actively managed crypto ETF. Notably, the firm’s proposed “T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF” includes Shiba Inu among its list of eligible assets alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other top coins. Industry analysts see this as a sign that legacy financial institutions are no longer ignoring digital assets. The move also suggests that institutional investors are preparing for a broader crypto resurgence once the US government resolves its ongoing shutdown and the SEC resumes ETF approvals. Shiba Inu price outlook for Q4 2025 Despite the near-term struggle to stay above $0.00001, optimism for a 2025 recovery remains strong. The combination of Shibarium’s growing adoption, expanding DeFi use cases, and SHIB’s ongoing token burn mechanism could provide the necessary foundation for a rebound. Bullish projections suggest that in a favourable market, Shiba Inu could revisit the $0.000025 to $0.00005 range, supported by reduced supply and renewed investor enthusiasm. But whether the token can replicate its past explosive runs will depend on broader market conditions and its ability to break through the stubborn resistance trendline. For now, Shiba Inu price remains in a critical consolidation zone — quiet, steady, and seemingly asleep. But as history has shown, this “sleeping coin” often wakes suddenly and violently, reminding the market that patience in crypto can sometimes pay off spectacularly.

Swyftx crypto exchange published its fifth annual Australian Crypto Survey on Wednesday, revealing that adult ownership of digital assets remained unchanged, and trust in them continues to decline. The Swyftx report revealed that nearly 60% of Australians do not trust cryptocurrency, up from 57% the previous year. It also showed that the top three reasons Australians do not own crypto assets are a lack of regulation (46%), a lack of knowledge about the asset class (45%), and concerns related to fraud (31%). According to Swyftx, Australians believe that digital assets will play a crucial role in the nation’s economic future. Swyftx data showed that 4 out of 10 (39%) believe that cryptocurrency will be necessary to the economy, while 36% disagree. The percentage of Australians under 50 who believe cryptocurrency will play a central role in the economy increases to 51%, representing roughly half of the adult population. A third (32%) of the respondents say they disagree that crypto will be important to the economy. Investment trends shift among Gen Z Jason Titman, CEO of Swyftx, said that many investors are more concerned with the actual implementation of the regulations than they are with the prospect of crypto regulation at some undefined point. Titman added that many people still see cryptocurrency as an iconoclastic asset class, which is not necessarily a desirable feature for investors with lower risk appetites. The Swyftx report revealed that Australians under 35 continue to be the most active and successful cryptocurrency investors in the nation. Approximately 82% of Gen Z traders reported making money in the previous year, with an average gain of around $9,958. Parents with children under the age of 18 have the highest ownership rate (39%), while non-parents have a rate of only 12%. Only 6% of Australians aged 50 and above currently own any digital assets. Swyftx estimates that one in five (21%) or 4.5 million Australians currently own digital assets. At least 1.6 million more people are expected to join the digital asset market in 2026. “While there’s reason to be excited about the future impact of digital assets, most of the mainstream messaging around this asset class remains cautionary on scams and risk.” – Jason Titman , Chief Executive Officer of Swyftx. Titman claimed that young Australians are now investing in developing asset classes to diversify their finances. He argued that Gen Z and Millennials are undoubtedly more at ease with owning intangible assets than previous generations. The Swyftx CEO added that younger Australians are diversifying into other asset classes as a result of the exorbitant cost of real estate. Jason Titman argued that, if current trends continue, cryptocurrency will overtake stocks as the preferred investment for Gen Zs and Millennials in a few years. He explained that Gen Z and Millennials feel that to climb the property ladder, one needs a level of exposure to high-beta assets, such as a diversified portfolio. Australia expands oversight of digital assets and ATM’s As previously reported by Cryptopolitan, Tony Burke, Australia’s Minister for Home Affairs, announced new regulations on October 15 that allow the AUSTRAC to impose restrictions on cryptocurrency ATMs. Burke stated that the new rules will prevent money laundering and shield vulnerable Australians from financial crime and scams. The Home Affairs Minister of Australia referred to ATMs as a “high-risk product” that is connected to child abuse, scams, and money laundering. Burke claimed that the change will enhance AUSTRAC’s capacity to mitigate the risks associated with money laundering linked to cryptocurrency ATMs. In March, Australia’s national Treasurer, Jim Chalmers, unveiled a regulatory framework for stablecoins, featuring four pillars of reform: a review of improvements to the regulatory sandbox, exchange licensing, more specific tax guidelines, and other measures.

Related Reading: All It Took Was A Tweet: FLOKI Jumps 27% After Musk Mentions It Sleeping Coins Stir After Years According to CryptoQuant analyst JA Maartun, exactly 15,965 BTC that had been idle for about three years were shifted earlier in the day. The coins moved while Bitcoin traded below $110,000, and at roughly $108,000 a coin the batch is worth about $1.724 billion. CryptoQuant’s on-chain records show these addresses had little to no activity since late 2022 and early 2023, and the funds were sent to undisclosed destinations. Market watchers flagged the timing. Old coins waking up during a pullback can signal profit-taking, or simply internal reshuffles between private accounts and trading venues. Reports have disclosed that such moves sometimes reflect tax planning, exchange custody changes, or large holders adjusting positions — but the exact motive here is not public. 15,965 BTC aged 2–3 years just moved on-chain ⏱️ This cohort has been dormant since late 2022–2023—until now. pic.twitter.com/vw2z0fjHvv — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) October 22, 2025 New Whales Underwater Data from market trackers point to pressure on newer large holders who bought near recent highs. Those so-called new whales carry an average cost of $113,000 per BTC, leaving many positions underwater while prices trade below that level. The unrealized losses tied to these wallets are approaching $7 billion, according to the same datasets. At the same time, accumulation by other big wallets continues. Analysts reported that about 26,500 BTC have flowed into accumulation addresses in recent days, a sign that some large players are adding quietly during the dip. This mix of selling and buying creates a tug-of-war in price action. Short-term dynamics are fragile. Support around $107,000–$108,000 is one level traders are watching closely. If that zone holds, a bounce is possible; if it fails, further downside toward $100,000 could follow. Price Targets Spark Debate The big movements have intensified debate over how high Bitcoin might go next. According to public comments, the CEO of Galaxy Digital said reaching $250,000 by year-end would require “a heck of a lot of crazy stuff.” Other market figures keep more bullish targets in play: Fundstrat’s Tom Lee and BitMEX’s Arthur Hayes have each voiced conviction in $200,000–$250,000 outcomes, pointing to potential policy moves and inflows as drivers. Institutional numbers are part of the backdrop. Galaxy Digital reported a record quarter with $29 billion in revenue, a figure that supporters cite as evidence of growing institutional involvement in the market. That growth is part of why some investors remain confident even as short-term charts wobble.

The group cautioned that a fake website has been circulating online, designed to steal users’ funds by mimicking the project’s legitimate platforms. The fraudulent site reportedly tricks investors into connecting their crypto wallets, allowing scammers to drain their assets instantly. This warning comes amid ongoing efforts by the Shiba Inu team to curb a growing wave of impersonation and phishing attacks across the ecosystem. Fraudulent Website Mimics Official Shiba Inu Platforms In a post , Susbarium, the malicious website, https://app-shib-io.pages.dev/snapshot, has been deliberately designed to look identical to official Shiba Inu portals such as ShibaSwap and Shib.io. The scammers reportedly cloned the design and interface of legitimate platforms to deceive unsuspecting investors. Once a user connects their wallet, the attackers gain automatic access, allowing them to siphon funds without further consent. Susbarium stated that scammers often promote these sites using fake incentives, including presales, bonuses, and cross-chain swaps, to lure users. The watchdog emphasized that Shib.io remains the only verified and legitimate platform for all Shiba Inu ecosystem activities. It also noted that Shib.io serves as the official hub for ecosystem tokens, LEASH, BONE, SHIB, and TREAT, along with ShibaSwap and other related projects. Susbarium urged community members to remain vigilant and avoid engaging with suspicious platforms that attempt to replicate official designs. The alert further reminded users that the broader Shiba Inu development team has verified and endorsed only the Shib.io domain for authentic ecosystem interactions. Growing Threat of Impersonation and Security Risks Beyond phishing websites, Susbarium warned that scammers have been impersonating Shiba Inu administrators and developers across social media. The practice has reportedly persisted for years, with multiple cases documented by the alert channel. Susbarium has continued to issue similar alerts throughout the year, including reports of fake ShibaSwap sites created to drain assets. In response to the latest threat, the watchdog outlined key safety measures to help users protect themselves. It advised against connecting wallets to unverified domains and encouraged the use of revoke.cash to revoke token approvals for those who may have already interacted with malicious links. The alert also urged users to report phishing domains to their wallet providers or browser security teams. Additionally, it recommended following only verified Shiba Inu channels on X, Telegram, and Discord for accurate updates.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|SHIB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-23 13:31:07

The funding will accelerate Web3 adoption across Asia and expand stablecoin use in real financial transactions. The company plans to develop stablecoin infrastructure that integrates with both fiat payment networks and Web3 ecosystems, enabling smoother interaction between enterprises, banks, and blockchain platforms. StraitsX will focus on three main areas: Business API — Tools for real-time settlements and seamless integration of fiat and stablecoin payments Cross-border payments — On-chain channels for faster and more cost-efficient international transfers, with PayFazz leading rollout in Indonesia Card issuance — In partnership with RedotPay and VISA, users will be able to spend stablecoins via physical and virtual cards with instant fiat conversion StraitsX co-founder and CEO Tianwei Liu said the company aims to make stablecoins a core part of global payments infrastructure, proving they are suitable for real-world financial activity. UQPAY CEO Jack Lee added that their shared mission is to build a regulated and seamless payment ecosystem that unites traditional finance with Web3. Similar Companies Are Racing to Build Stablecoin Payment Networks StraitsX is not alone in this movement. Major players worldwide are building stablecoin-based payment rails: Circle (USDC) partners with Visa and Mastercard for on-chain payments Ripple is developing institutional settlement solutions for banks and remittance firms PayPal (PYUSD) enables stablecoin transfers inside its consumer network Alipay and WeChat Pay (Asia) are exploring blockchain for cross-border settlement pilots Just like StraitsX, these companies see stablecoins as faster, cheaper, and more predictable than legacy settlement systems, especially in cross-border payments and digital commerce. The new capital will help StraitsX expand its regional footprint and prepare for a unified network that connects stablecoin rails and fiat systems across Asia. With major partnerships and rising demand for blockchain-based settlement, StraitsX plans to play a leading role in Asia’s next generation of digital payments.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-23 13:31:46

53539878,612808,1761226628,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53539878.jpeg,La Ethereum Foundation conferma: l’hard fork Fusaka introdurrà un limite massimo di gas per transazione (EIP-7825),https://bitcoinist.com/la-ethereum-foundation-conferma-lhard-fork-fusaka-introdurra-un-limite-massimo-di-gas-per-transazione-eip-7825/,"La Ethereum Foundation ha confermato che il prossimo hard fork Fusaka introdurrà un limite massimo a livello di protocollo sulla quantità di gas che una singola transazione può consumare, formalizzato come EIP-7825.Il tetto è fissato a 2²⁴ gas — ovvero 16.777.216 unità, segnando la prima volta che Ethereum applica un limite per transazione distinto dal limite di gas per blocco.La modifica è già attiva sulle testnet Holesky e Sepolia e verrà implementata sulla mainnet al momento dell’attivazione di Fusaka. In un post pubblicato il 21 ottobre, Toni Wahrstätter ha spiegato chiaramente la motivazione: “A partire dal prossimo hard fork Fusaka, l’EIP-7825 introduce un limite massimo di gas per transazione pari a 2²⁴ (≈16,78 milioni di gas).” La Foundation sottolinea che, pur limitando le singole transazioni, questo cambiamento non modifica il limite di gas per blocco.L’obiettivo è ridurre i vettori di attacco DoS ( Denial-of-Service ) in cui una singola chiamata troppo grande può monopolizzare un intero blocco, e migliorare la prevedibilità del “riempimento” dei blocchi mentre la rete si prepara all’esecuzione parallela. Un nuovo equilibrio tra complessità delle transazioni e throughput di sistema Con l’EIP-7825, Ethereum traccia una linea chiara tra complessità delle singole transazioni e capacità complessiva del sistema.In passato, alcune transazioni particolarmente grandi potevano consumare quasi tutto il gas di un blocco (circa 45 milioni), creando problemi di tempistiche e pianificazione per builder e validatori. Il nuovo limite obbliga quindi le operazioni che superano i 16,78 milioni di gas a essere suddivise in più transazioni sequenziali e più leggere.La Foundation specifica che “per la maggior parte degli utenti non cambierà nulla”, poiché la grande maggioranza delle transazioni reali resta ben al di sotto di questa soglia.Il rischio riguarda principalmente contratti complessi, script di deploy e router specializzati. Cosa significa per Ethereum e per gli utenti Da una prospettiva di roadmap, questo limite rappresenta una base per l’esecuzione parallela. Il post collega la modifica a sviluppi futuri come EIP-7928, previsto nell’era “Glamsterdam”, dove transazioni prevedibili e limitate sono un prerequisito per una concorrenza efficace nel livello di esecuzione. Garantendo che in ogni blocco possano sempre essere incluse più transazioni indipendenti — anche in condizioni estreme di mempool — il limite riduce i casi peggiori di congestione e semplifica la progettazione dei pianificatori per i builder che sperimentano percorsi di esecuzione parallela. Dettagli tecnici dell’EIP-7825 La specifica è semplice e diretta: “Limitare ogni transazione a 16.777.216 (2²⁴) gas per migliorare la resilienza contro determinati vettori di attacco DoS e rendere più prevedibile l’elaborazione delle transazioni man mano che aumentano i limiti di blocco.” Questa semplicità è proprio ciò che ha reso l’EIP popolare tra gli sviluppatori core: una regola piccola, chiara e compatibile con i futuri upgrade di scalabilità. Le discussioni su come codificare e comunicare il limite sono andate avanti per mesi, anche su Ethereum Magicians e durante le call AllCoreDevs.Un punto centrale del dibattito è stato allineare i target di gas per blocco a multipli di 2²⁴, garantendo così che i builder possano sempre includere almeno n transazioni se la mempool ne contiene n idonee — una questione di prevedibilità più che di throughput puro. Implementazione e impatti per sviluppatori Tutti i principali client — Geth, Erigon, Reth, Nethermind e Besu — hanno già implementato il cambiamento nelle versioni compatibili con Fusaka, riducendo il rischio di divergenze tra client al momento dell’attivazione. Le chiamate eth_call non saranno influenzate, ma le transazioni pre-firmate che superano il limite dovranno essere ri-firmate con un valore di gas inferiore. Per gli sviluppatori, il percorso di aggiornamento è semplice: testare su Holesky o Sepolia, ottimizzare le operazioni batch, aggiornare la logica di stima del gas e le alert per segnalare rapidamente eventuali superamenti del limite. Contesto politico e filosofico Storicamente, Ethereum ha preferito introdurre vincoli minimali e generali, lasciando la complessità ai livelli superiori. L’EIP-7825 segue questa filosofia: non impone come debbano essere scritti i contratti, ma assicura un limite superiore che protegge la vitalità della rete e prepara il terreno per un futuro multi-threaded. Non modifica le dinamiche del mercato delle fee, né tocca l’economia dei blob o i target di blocco di altri EIP.Come riassume la Foundation: “Questo limite stabilisce una base più sicura e prevedibile per un throughput più elevato nei futuri aggiornamenti.” Un piccolo passo tecnico, ma un grande passo strategico verso la scalabilità del layer di esecuzione di Ethereum .",Uncategorized|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 13:37:08

The figure, reported by Hedge Fund Research Inc. (HFR) on Thursday, shows nearly $34 billion in net inflows during the three months through September — the biggest quarterly inflow since 2007, before the financial crisis hit global markets. The increase wasn’t just new money. Funds across all strategies posted an average return of 5.4% in the quarter, driven by equity and macro plays that capitalized on market volatility under President Donald Trump’s administration. Hedge funds have thrived in a year of unpredictable markets shaped by trade policies, tariffs, and currency swings, with investors hunting for uncorrelated returns amid heightened geopolitical noise. The renewed confidence in hedge funds reflects a shift by wealthy clients and institutions toward diversification, especially as stocks and bonds move in erratic patterns. Large hedge-fund managers capture bulk of inflows The biggest hedge-fund managers took nearly all the new money in the third quarter, as investors preferred size and liquidity. Firms managing more than $5 billion in assets dominated allocations, underscoring how capital keeps concentrating in large, well-established players. At Bloomberg’s Hedge Fund Forum in London on Wednesday, Adam Singleton, chief investment officer at Man Group Plc’s External Alpha, said investors are desperate for protection that doesn’t move with broader markets. “We’re looking for things that will diversify markets right now, will not get too excited by the hype around different parts of the economic environment, and will generate alpha in ways which are uncorrelated if things are fine, but particularly, uncorrelated if things are not fine,” Adam said. That mindset is exactly what drove the quarter’s strong inflows; equity and macro strategies led performance, but crypto-focused hedge funds quietly became one of the strongest performers. After taking heavy losses early in 2025, crypto funds rebounded with double-digit gains in the third quarter, bringing year-to-date returns to 6.7%, according to data from HFR. Whether this surge in capital is a lasting change or just another temporary rush on the trading floor remains unclear, but hedge funds have never looked more mainstream. The sector that once symbolized “alternative finance” has become a core part of institutional portfolios. In its report, HFR pointed out that most hedge-fund capital now comes from pension funds, university endowments, and sovereign wealth funds, all chasing new ways to strengthen their global investment strategies. Domestically, hedge funds remain limited to accredited investors (people earning at least $200,000 annually or holding a net worth of $1 million) as US regulations restrict participation to those capable of bearing higher risk. It’s another reminder of how uneven the system is. On one side are Americans with enough wealth to invest in complex funds promising diversification and alpha. On the other are millions struggling to manage car payments, child-care costs, and grocery bills. For now, though, hedge funds are riding their strongest wave of momentum in almost two decades.

The Tokyo-listed company currently holds 3,866 ETH, making it Japan’s largest public ETH treasury and the 11th-largest in the world. The company posted on X, stating that it purchased 2,365 ETH in seven days and plans to continue buying more to build a 100,000 ETH treasury, with assistance from ARK Invest and Susquehanna International Group. Quantum Solutions increases ETH Holdings quickly Quantum Solutions spent about 150 million yen (about $983,000) each day last week to buy Ethereum. The company aims to build the largest digital asset treasuries in the world, and its founder, Francis Zhou, stated that it will continue to buy ETH until it reaches its 100,000 ETH holdings. Quantum Solutions now holds 3,866 ETH (about $14.8 million) and also has a smaller Bitcoin treasury with 11.6 BTC (nearly $1.3 million). Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, said her company is more than happy to support Quantum Solutions’ mission. The investment management firm will fund Japan’s first institutional-grade Ethereum digital asset treasury (DAT) to continue purchasing ETH, aiming to achieve a 100,000 ETH holding. Ark Invest will also lend the company credibility, as other investors and partners will see that a popular and well-respected global investor is backing Quantum Solutions. The investment management company also invested in BitMine earlier this year and added Quantum Solutions’ stock to its innovation and fintech-focused investment funds in September. Favorable rules fuel Ethereum accumulation Companies like Quantum Solutions can easily buy and hold ETH in Japan because the country has favorable rules for digital asset treasuries, unlike neighbors like Hong Kong , India, and Australia, where regulators have started making it difficult for DATs to grow. Analysts say that fewer investors today are interested in DATs and that share prices for some of the biggest crypto holders have dropped recently. However, this hasn’t stopped Quantum Solutions from buying more coins. Ethereum treasury BitMine Immersion bought the dip, acquiring 203,826 ETH last week to bring its current holdings to over 3.2 million digital coins . Originally a Bitcoin mining firm, it has transitioned to a 100% ETH treasury strategy, and now controls roughly 2.7% of the total Ethereum supply. The company stated that it now holds 3,236,014 ETH, purchased at an average price of $4,022 per coin. BitMine Immersion currently holds the largest Ethereum treasury among publicly traded firms and the second-largest overall cryptocurrency treasury. According to the firm, it owns 192 Bitcoins worth $21.3 million. Other prominent Wall Street and crypto-related firms holding substantial Ethereum positions include Sharplink Gaming, Bit Digital, Coinbase Global, and ETHZilla. Each of these firms owns at least 100,000 ETH worth hundreds of millions of dollars as of the time of writing.

Consequently, chipmakers doubt whether the agency can meet their energy security needs. During an event on Thursday, October 23, Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association Chair Cliff Hou mentioned that the industry is concerned about whether the government can effectively incorporate new supplies as previously pledged. “We hope the government will share an updated schedule for green energy supplies for us to review,” added Hou, who also serves as a senior vice president at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co . Energy analysts raise concerns about Taiwan’s energy supply status Earlier reports from reliable sources indicated that Taiwan faces significant challenges in accelerating the adoption of renewable energy in the manufacturing industry. To address this, the government had first pledged to ensure 20% of its energy comes from renewable sources by mid-decade. However, they later lowered this target to 15% by 2025. As of late 2024, data released from Taiwan’s energy administration highlighted that the total percentage of renewables accounted for less than 12% of the overall energy mix. In May, energy analysts raised concerns about the island’s energy supply status. This was after they released reports stating that the ruling party had closed Taiwan’s last nuclear reactor, eliminating a power source that provided approximately 5% of the nation’s electricity the previous year. Therefore, since Taiwan lacks a sufficient nuclear power supply, it may be forced to rely more on imported fuels, such as liquefied natural gas, to support industries that require a significant amount of energy, including chip manufacturing. The fuel price hikes and investments in renewable energy have created financial strain for Taipower, Taiwan’s major electricity supplier. To keep prices affordable, the state-owned utility has absorbed rising expenses and reported losses surpassing NT$420 billion, equivalent to about $13.6 billion, by the end of last year. Taiwan faces significant energy issues amid nuclear vote defeat Reports dated August this year highlighted that a weekend vote to restore a crucial nuclear plant in Taiwan was defeated. Following this outcome, sources noted that the island’s government is struggling to address energy security challenges and meet the increasing demands of a significant semiconductor industry . Regarding the vote conducted, approximately 74% of voters in a recent referendum favored the reopening of the Maanshan nuclear plant, which was closed earlier this year. This illustrates a big shift from 2021, when voters rejected a proposal to reopen an inactive plant in Lungmen. Still, sources close to the situation mentioned that the supportive votes did not reach the 25% of eligible voters required for the opposition-backed referendum to pass, thereby allowing for a more limited use of nuclear power in Taiwan. The entire episode also inspired analysts like William Yang from the International Crisis Group to comment on the subject at hand. Yang stated that this result still sends an important message about shifting public opinion. He further noted that while the result hadn’t met legal requirements, it had shown the disconnection between what the government desires and what people actually think, “It also shows that the public is worried about Taiwan’s energy security and ability to maintain a steady energy supply,” Yang added. Meanwhile, the semiconductor industry in Taiwan claims it is not affected by China’s new export restrictions on rare earths . Unlike in the electric vehicle and consumer electronics industries, local chipmakers stressed that their production processes do not depend on China’s rare earths. The newly restricted substances are not used in chip manufacturing, the Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs statement said, so there will be no disruption to its semiconductor production. China recently announced that it would add five more elements to the restricted rare earth list, following Beijing’s intensifying of its grip on critical materials ahead of a planned meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump.

Analysts don’t just look at price charts; they study underlying mechanics, how tokens accrue value from real economic activity, and how network effects turn infrastructure into demand. From that analytical perspective, RentStac represents a comparable model, a protocol that anchors token value to real-world cash flows such as rents, yields, and property appreciation, all verified and distributed on-chain. What Made XRP a Model for Analysts XRP became a reference point because it had a clear utility thesis as an infrastructure token for real-time settlement, recurring demand where each new transaction added liquidity and network volume, a scalable addressable market involving global cross-border payments and institutional integrations, and an adoption–liquidity loop where more integrations increased transaction volumes and token utility. XRP became an adoption-driven asset, not just a speculative one, and that is the type of structure analysts now look for across emerging presales. The RentStac Thesis — Key Facts RentStac.com is a decentralized, non-custodial protocol that allows anyone to participate in the real estate market as an investor, manager, or validator. Each property is represented by tokens issued through a dedicated SPV, ensuring that holders have proportional rights to real-world economic flows and governance decisions. Core data from the technical whitepaper describe a presale of seven phases, 40 percent of total supply, targeting 27.45 million dollars raised with unsold tokens permanently burned. Cash flows from rents, leases, and appreciation are collected by SPVs and distributed automatically in stablecoins or RNS. Part of the real income funds continuous token buybacks and permanent burns, creating value tied to real yield. RNS holders vote via DAO on key decisions covering property managers, asset sales, protocol parameters, and new integrations. The technology stack includes multi-chain Layer-2 infrastructure, smart contracts, independent oracles, IoT data for on-chain KPIs, and transparent dashboards. Liquidity is supported through a built-in secondary marketplace with peer-to-peer trading, liquidity pools, and centralized and decentralized exchange integrations. The legal framework uses multi-jurisdictional SPVs to ensure enforceable ownership rights and regulatory compliance. XRP focuses on settlement infrastructure for global transfers, while RentStac focuses on tokenized property assets generating real yield. XRP demand comes from transaction volume and institutional use, while RentStac demand is linked to investor interest in yield and fractional access. XRP relies on ongoing payment activity, while RentStac relies on continuous property cash flows. XRP builds value through liquidity and utility-based demand, while RentStac ties value to real cash flows, buyback and burn, and stablecoin payouts. XRP offers on-chain tracking and integrations, while RentStac uses on-chain SPVs, IoT KPIs, oracles, and audits. XRP governance is centralized, while RentStac is decentralized through DAO governance. Analysts point out that RentStac links real economic performance, such as rents and appreciation, directly to token demand and deflation, producing a cash-flow-anchored model rather than a purely speculative one. What Analysts Look for During a Presale A presale evaluation is based on fundamentals. Analysts monitor legal structure and the clarity and enforceability of investor rights through SPVs, operational transparency with measurable KPIs like occupancy, net yield, and maintenance costs, asset pipeline and integration schedules, distribution logic with stablecoin payouts and token buybacks linked to verified revenues, liquidity design with marketplaces and incentives, tokenomics integrity with fixed supply and deflationary mechanics, and governance execution through DAO proposals and binding on-chain voting. RentStac’s whitepaper addresses these aspects with a technical and compliance-driven approach rarely seen in early-stage presales. Risks and Mitigation Operational risk depends on property management performance and is mitigated by KPI dashboards, IoT data, and oracle verification. Regulatory risk comes from varying laws across jurisdictions and is addressed through localized SPVs and full KYC and AML compliance. Liquidity risk comes from thin early secondary markets and is mitigated by internal marketplaces and liquidity pool incentives. Execution risk involves property onboarding timelines and is controlled through milestone-based escrow and DAO oversight. Why the XRP Analogy Makes Analytical Sense This comparison is not about technology but economic mechanics. Both models rely on real, recurring flows rather than pure speculation, transparent measurable performance metrics, deflationary or value-accruing token designs, and governance that connects community to growth. XRP showed that a token linked to real infrastructure can sustain demand, and RentStac applies that logic to tokenized real estate, using smart contracts and DAO governance to automate what was once slow, opaque, and inaccessible. If the 2020–2024 cycle was about infrastructure like L1s, L2s, and DeFi plumbing, the next wave will be about real yield and real-world integration. RentStac stands at that intersection, merging institutional-grade property structures with compliance and escrow and combining them with the transparency and automation of decentralized finance. Its RNS token captures value not from hype, but from verified on-chain cash flows, DAO-based governance, and a deflationary economic loop. It is not the next XRP but a new application of the same principle that made XRP’s early phase compelling, a clear, measurable, real-world foundation for token value.

Analyst Explains!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/beware-of-this-danger-bitcoin-could-experience-its-biggest-bear-market-ever-analyst-explains/,"As quantum computing becomes increasingly prevalent in our lives, it is reportedly a significant threat to Bitcoin (BTC). It is being argued that quantum computing could one day undermine the cryptographic foundations that secure trillions of dollars in crypto assets. At this point, this debate was rekindled yesterday after Google introduced its new chip, named Willow, developed in the field of quantum computing. Analysts warn that quantum computing could break Bitcoin's encryption within 2 to 8 years, with one warning coming from crypto analyst Charles Edwards. Charles Edwards said that he once believed that future Bitcoin bear markets would become milder over time as markets mature, but that has now changed. At this point, Edwads stated that now Bitcoin has the quantum threat as a very important and serious threat in front of me. Edwards warned that if the quantum threat is not resolved soon, possibly as early as next year, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies could face their biggest bear market ever. “I would think future Bitcoin bear markets would have lower lows. But if we don't solve Quantum next year, we'll likely experience the biggest bear market in history.” *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: Beware of This Danger!

ROBA is launching to redefine the robotics industry, which is projected to hit $218 billion by 2030, by empowering creators and eliminating proprietary stacks. The current robotics landscape is fractured, closed, and forces every new idea to start from scratch, leading to frustration instead of innovation. ROBA delivers a solution that simplifies the workflow through no-code enablement, eliminating the need for the 10+ fragmented platforms previously required to build a single robot. Breaking Silos: Openness and Guaranteed Ownership The core of ROBA’s launch is its commitment to transparency and user control. ROBA is breaking robotics out of closed corporate silos by ensuring full ownership of your data, your assets, and your revenue. ROBA enables creators to build robots with open hardware and software, test them in a powerful physics simulator, and deploy seamlessly—all while retaining full IP and data ownership. This directly addresses growing privacy concerns and the demand for decentralized platforms that are fueling the robotics revolution. The platform is designed to allow developers to ""learn fast in simulation, ship safely in reality"". The Unified Workflow: Build → Train → Share → Monetize ROBA provides everything creators need, from the initial idea to a working robot, through its two core components: ROBA Studio: Provides comprehensive build support by providing and connecting the best technologies in the market, including Data & AI Frameworks, Development Environment & Tools, and a powerful Simulation and template library, all presented within a unified GUI. The ROBA Creator Hub: Acts as the central marketplace for sharing, versioning, and discovering robotics assets, models, and worlds. Key enablers include challenge and evaluation packs, and a dynamic talent pool. This unified process is the ""one simple workflow"" that breaks closed silos. Introducing ROBA LINK: Aggregating the Ecosystem ROBA is continuously expanding its unified solution with the integration of ROBA Link. ROBA Link functions as a critical middle layer that not only aggregates and connects existing 3rd party tools, SDKs, and APIs. This layer enhances the developer experience through agentic no-code, making the use of all developer tools seamless and intuitive. Developers truly do not need 10 or more scattered solutions and obtuse workflows to build one robot. ""The inspiration for the current project at ROBA Labs comes from the fragmented nature of robotics development and my previous experience. It was very challenging to build an intelligent system; building robots usually requires multiple tools across different platforms, which is complex and inefficient. We are solving that by creating a single unified platform where everything could come together, making robot creation simpler, faster and more accessible. That's what led me to create ROBA: a platform where intelligent robots can learn, adapt and connect through the blockchain and AI."" Farid Hossain — ROBA Labs Founder Making Everyone a Stakeholder ROBA establishes a community-focused model where financial incentives perfectly align between creators (supply) and users (demand). ROBA is the first App Store for robots where contributors actually get paid, generating income when their valuable assets are used. This system is powered by the $ROBA utility token, used to pay for assets, reward contributors, and govern the platform via RobaDAO. For instance, a student can upload a drone template, a startup can license it, and both get rewarded in tokens through automated royalties. Approximately ~30% of $ROBA is allocated to the ecosystem and rewards to ensure continuous compensation for contributors. Backed by Industry Firepower ROBA is built upon a strong foundation, incubated with NextWave Incubator, which brings distribution and Go-To-Market acceleration.

The post revealed that the U.S. central bank is exploring “payment accounts” that could allow crypto and fintech firms to access Fed payment rails. The announcement quickly became a focal point across the community, with crypto enthusiast Crypto Bitlord offering a notable response that reignited conversation about XRP and its potential alignment with the future of global payments. Ok sorry about the $XRP FUD because I’m slowly connecting the dots now -The $21 teleport isn’t a dream https://t.co/NTmCIxaJAM — Crypto Bitlord (@crypto_bitlord7) October 21, 2025 Bitlord’s Response and the Return of the XRP Narrative Crypto Bitlord, known for his outspoken commentary on market developments, referenced earlier skepticism surrounding XRP but suggested a shift in perspective, indicating that earlier doubts may have been premature. His comments implied a recognition of deeper connections between regulatory and infrastructure changes in the financial system and the potential role XRP could play in them. This acknowledgment was significant given his history of light-hearted criticism and “FUD” directed at the asset, which he now appeared to retract. By mentioning the concept of the “$21 teleport,” Bitlord indirectly alluded to a long-standing theory within the XRP community regarding the token’s potential future valuation and utility in large-scale settlement systems. While such projections remain speculative, the timing of his statement, aligned with the Federal Reserve’s ongoing evaluation of payment access for crypto firms, has drawn attention to how these developments could intersect with Ripple’s payment technologies. Community Reaction and Broader Implications Responses to Bitlord’s post reflected a mix of long-term confidence and renewed optimism among XRP supporters. One X user, Kahlim, referenced Bitlord’s previous statements from years ago, expressing ongoing faith in XRP’s long-term trajectory and thanking him for past insights.

Despite the AI HPC shift, CIFR remains highly dependent on Bitcoin, and its valuation appears stretched compared to peers with larger operations and treasuries. A $20 price target and Hold rating reflect concerns that the market has priced in too much premium too early, with better-valued alternatives available. Long-term prospects are compelling due to AI HPC growth and major contracts, but near-term performance may lag as fundamentals catch up to valuation. Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ: CIFR ) is a Bitcoin mining and AI high-performance computing technology company. This is a dual, well-diversified business model that uses large-scale data centers for both Bitcoin mining operations and HPC hosting. The CIFR stock price appreciated by roughly 236% over the past 12 months and significantly outperformed the benchmark. This resulted from Bitcoin appreciation and a pivot to a high-demand artificial intelligence landscape. The company has become less dependent on Bitcoin volatility, which the market has rewarded with a stock price increase. Although I think that the decision to pivot to AI HPC has been the right one, I believe the CIFR stock price may have run ahead of its fundamentals. Despite the pivot to AI hosting, the company remains highly dependent on BTC, and with the current volatility, sentiment may change. Bitcoin seasonality could still be in play, but I think investors may shift to other legacy miners who have decided to pursue this high-demand landscape, too, but have not been rewarded with a premium yet. This is why I think Cipher Mining is a Hold with a $20 price target over the next 12 months. I believe this company may be a compelling opportunity for long-term investors who seek data center and Bitcoin exposure via the equity market, but I also think that investors could choose other alternatives available on the market, which could weigh on the stock price in the near term. A Pivot To AI HPC Is A Game-Changer, But I Argue The Market Priced In Too High A Premium, Too Early Cipher Mining is one of a few legacy Bitcoin miners that have decided to shift and diversify its business to AI HPC operations. However, CIFR and Iren Limited (NASDAQ: IREN ) were the ones that aggressively shifted to this landscape, and the market has rewarded them with a significant premium. However, I think that investors may have priced in too much, slightly too early, and that could weigh on the stock price. CIFR: Stock Price Performance Versus Peers (Seeking Alpha) The chart above indicates that Cipher Mining has been the second-best performing legacy Bitcoin miner. Together with IREN, they have significantly outperformed CleanSpark and MARA Holdings , mainly due to an early shift to the AI HPC landscape. It does not necessarily mean that CIFR or IREN need to come down, but there appears to be a gap in valuations, which supports my thesis that the stock market may have run ahead of its fundamentals. The chart below reveals the comparison of the following in terms of the total market capitalization . This appears to be interesting, highlighting that CIFR has roughly $7.11 billion in market cap, which is slightly below MARA Holdings, and about 30% above CLSK. CIFR: Market Cap Comparison Versus Peers (Seeking Alpha) In terms of revenue (TTM) , Cipher Mining appears to be the smallest Bitcoin and AI HPC play. CIFR generated roughly $159 million over the past 12 months, which is nearly 3x below CleanSpark's approximately $632 million and more than 4x lower than MARA Holdings of nearly $799 million . This indicates that there appears to be a gap in valuations, which does not necessarily result in CIFR stock decline, but may indicate that there are better alternatives in the market, which could weigh on the stock price. CIFR: Revenue (TTM) Versus Peers (Seeking Alpha) Furthermore, MARA Holdings is the second-largest publicly listed Bitcoin treasury in the world with more than 53k coins. This equals about $5.7 billion in cash at the Bitcoin price of $108,000 . CLSK has more than 13k coins, and CIFR holds roughly 1.5k Bitcoins in its treasury. This supports my thesis of a significant gap in valuations. Cipher Mining produced 251 Bitcoin in September, while MARA produced 736 BTC and CLSK 629 BTC , highlighting a massive underperformance in terms of its mining operations and smaller scale versus its peers. CIFR: Bitcoin Treasury Companies (Bitcointreasuries.net) This is why I think that investors may shift to other alternatives in the market, which have not appreciated that significantly in their stock price, although following the same playbook, highlighting a pivot to the AI HPC landscape. There is also a possibility that if AI HPC demand continues, Cipher Mining may continue to appreciate in the stock price. For instance, the high-performance computing market for AI was valued at about $112 billion in 2024 , and is expected to triple in size over the next 4 years and reach roughly $360 billion by 2029. This highlights a 26.3% CAGR. If this materializes, then one could argue that CIFR remains cheap at the current valuations. On the upside, on September 25, the company announced a long-term agreement with Fluidstack, underscoring nearly $3 billion in contracted revenue over the next 10 years. Google backstopped this and acquired nearly a 5.4% stake in the legacy Bitcoin miner. I think this deserves a higher premium, but based on my comparison, I believe it may be too elevated. This is why I think that in the near-term it could underperform its peers, as I argue that the market may have run ahead of its fundamentals. CIFR Remains A Bitcoin Miner, And That Could Spark End-Of-Year Rally, If BTC Seasonality Plays Out Although Cipher Mining pivoted to the artificial intelligence landscape, I think the market may continue to view it as a Bitcoin miner, and the stock price could be significantly impacted by the underlying volatility of the cryptocurrency. On the upside, this could turn out to be favorable for CIFR, highlighting that the last quarter of the year historically has been a bullish period for the crypto environment in general, and BTC in particular. CIFR: Bitcoin Seasonality (Coinglass.com) The table above indicates that Bitcoin throughout the last 3 months of the year appreciated by 78% on average, and reflected nearly 48% median returns. So far, Bitcoin is down by 5% since the beginning of October, which may highlight that if favorable seasonality plays out, the cryptocurrency environment, including equities with crypto exposure, may experience significant upside. I also think that the current crypto environment has additional tailwinds that fuel the bullish outlook and could spark an end-of-year rally. The current administration appears to be pro-crypto, which improves the investing landscape and encourages the adoption of digital assets. For instance, on July 18, President Trump signed the Genius Act , which establishes a framework for clearer stablecoin adoption. This is significantly important and also contributes heavily to the narrative of institutional adoption of the digital assets. Furthermore, there are more publicly listed companies that are adopting the Bitcoin HODL strategy. Currently, Strategy (NASDAQ: MSTR ) is leading with a massive amount of more than 640k BTC on its balance sheet. However, I think this substantially supports the bullish outlook for Bitcoin, as these companies may provide a floor price for the underlying by not selling their Bitcoin and continuing to accumulate coins as time passes by. I think that although the cryptocurrency landscape currently experiences fairly negative sentiment supported by a roughly 5% Bitcoin decline, it remains a volatile industry, and with a significant and favorable shift, the seasonality could still be in play. If that materializes, I think Cipher Mining could continue appreciating in the stock price. However, if the crypto industry remains weak, this could meaningfully impact the stock price, and it could correct from these levels. Cipher Mining Appears To Be Expensive, And I Am Not Sure Whether Fundamentals Justify It CIFR currently trades at a forward P/E of 50.21 , which highlights roughly a 2x premium versus the sector median of 25.49, and more than 2x overvaluation compared to the average company in the S&P500 at about 23.10x earnings multiple. CIFR: Forward P/E (YCharts) The chart above indicates that the current valuation also highlights a multi-year high, which supports a negative outlook for the company. This does not mean that CIFR can not trade at the current levels, but it signals that upside may be capped in the near term. The company trades at forward EV/Sales and Price/Sales of 27.19 and 26.72 , respectively, which underscores a 7x premium valuation compared to peers of 3.63 and 3.57. This implies that the market has priced in the future growth, and supports my thesis that investors may have run ahead of its fundamentals. CIFR: Capital Structure (Seeking Alpha) Cipher Mining appears to be a medium-leveraged business with total obligations of $189 million . The company has about $63 million in cash that partially offsets its debt, but leverage remains elevated. To highlight, this does not reflect its recent upsized private offering , which should translate to an estimate of $1.08 billion, which is expected to be used for data center expansion. Therefore, this underscores that CIFR may continue trading alongside other interest rate-sensitive names. The Fed anticipates reducing interest rates over the next two meetings by 0.25% each, and such a dovish monetary policy could be favorable for Cipher. The legacy Bitcoin miner barely grew its revenue over the past 12 months, indicating a 0.11% increase and massive underperformance versus the sector median of 7.12%. Although the market anticipates double-digit growth , fueled by a pivot to AI hosting in the years ahead, this also supports my thesis that the market may have priced a significant premium slightly too early, limiting upside in the short term. Nevertheless, the company grew Capex by 530% over the past 12 months, and that highlights substantial focus on a high-demand AI landscape. CIFR: Capital Expenditures (TTM) (YCharts) The company operates at below-market margins, and that is another argument for short-term consolidation. The gross profit margin (TTM) of 21.36% indicates more than 2x underperformance versus peers at 49.98%. The EBIT margin (TTM) of negative 69% underscores the disadvantage versus the sector median of 6.45% growth. I believe margins may improve with successful scale in the AI HPC landscape, but it also comes with execution risk. If AI demand weakens or does not translate into significant top and bottom-line growth, then current valuations may appear to be too inflated. Wall Street forecasts a $0.36 in diluted EPS for FY2025, and $0.66 for FY2026. This would put CIFR at about 27x earnings multiple for the FY2026 figure. I think that the company should be able to achieve these results, especially if BTC seasonality plays out, or at least it continues trading at above the 100k mark over the next year. The recent agreement with Fluidstack appears to be promising and supports a bullish stance for the company. I think that AI demand may continue further, but I also believe that the current forward P/E of more than 50x for FY2025 appears to be too elevated. If we take a $0.66 EPS estimate for FY2026, and apply a roughly 30x earnings multiple, we come in at my price target of nearly $20 over the next 12 months. This would signal 10% upside, but would likely underperform peers and reflect the benchmark performance. Conclusion: Cipher Mining Appears Compelling, But I Think There May Be Better Alternatives In The Market I think that Cipher Mining may appear to be a compelling opportunity for long-term investors who favor a high-growth AI landscape of data centers and crypto exposure via the equity market. However, based on my analysis, I would argue there may be better alternatives among legacy Bitcoin miners, which have also pivoted to AI HPC, but have not experienced a massive surge in the stock price. CIFR is also tied to execution risk, remains highly dependent on Bitcoin volatility, and future AI demand. At the current valuations, and after a massive triple-digit surge over the past 12 months, I think it may be extremely vulnerable if sentiment dramatically shifts. On the other hand, if AI-related demand continues, and BTC seasonality plays out, I believe CIFR could continue trading at an elevated multiple, especially if scaling in AI data centers plays out well. This is why I think Cipher Mining is a Hold with a $20 price target over the next 12 months. This indicates 10% upside possibility, yet in line with the benchmark. 13 Wall Street analysts forecast a $19 price target over the next year, which presents a 5% upside opportunity. I feel more bullish, as I think that AI appears to be revolutionary, and data center services play a crucial role in the landscape. Time will tell, but after significant performance, I would not be surprised if the stock consolidates from here.",CIFR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MINING|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-10-23 14:07:49

Speaking in a CNBC interview with Emily Wilkins, Armstrong said recent meetings with both Democratic and Republican lawmakers had been “very productive,” describing the level of cooperation as a rare and encouraging sign. JUST IN: Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong says, “There is strong bipartisan support to get this market structure legislation done.” pic.twitter.com/Z8PI1OXDJc — Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 23, 2025 “We had great meetings with Democrats and Republicans today,” he said. “There’s strong bipartisan support to get this market legislation done. It’s important for America and for the 15 million Americans involved in crypto.” The comment comes as Armstrong said a day earlier that he is “eager” to get to work on crypto market structure legislation as key Senate Democrats are set to meet with top digital asset executives on Wednesday. Coinbase’s Armstrong: Crypto Regulation “90% There” as CLARITY Act Advances in Senate Armstrong’s remarks echo the growing sense of momentum surrounding the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, also known as the CLARITY Act , which passed the House of Representatives in July with strong bipartisan support in a 294–137 vote. According to Armstrong, roughly 90% of the bill’s issues have already been resolved, with the remaining details expected to be ironed out once lawmakers meet to finalize the text. “A lot of collaboration is happening,” he said. “The last 10% of issues will be worked out once everyone gets in the room together.” The bill, now under Senate review, seeks to end years of uncertainty in U.S. crypto regulation by clearly distinguishing between securities and commodities in the digital asset market. Notably, under the proposed framework, digital assets built on sufficiently decentralized networks would fall under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), while more centralized or early-stage tokens would be classified as securities regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Source: Congress The bill also outlines clear rules for decentralized finance (DeFi), secondary market trading, and institutional custody, areas that have long lacked consistent federal guidance. “This is a critical moment for the crypto industry in the U.S.,” Armstrong said. “It will provide clarity, foster innovation, and ensure that the U.S. remains a leader in the global digital economy.” Crypto Leaders and Senators Signal Breakthrough in Bipartisan Market Structure Talks The comments come as a wave of senior industry executives, including Armstrong, Kraken co-CEO David Ripley, Uniswap Labs founder Hayden Adams, and Chainlink Labs’ Sergey Nazarov, met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill earlier this week . The meetings, attended by figures such as Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott (R-SC) and New York Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, lasted nearly three hours and centered on advancing the market structure legislation. Participants described the discussions as more substantive and high-level than previous industry engagements. Nazarov noted that “more senior senators were speaking at once,” showing a shift in tone among policymakers who “realize the economic value of the industry and need to address it correctly.” Sergey Nazarov chopping it up with the Senate Democrats in Washington DC today Is that Chuck Schumer? $LINK https://t.co/ScvA640BBR pic.twitter.com/HZOA8AONaF — wahndo (@Wahndo_) October 22, 2025 The meetings included separate sessions with Democratic and Republican lawmakers. Democrats raised questions about illicit finance and DeFi oversight , while Republicans reiterated support for advancing the bill. Senate Banking Committee spokesperson Jeff Naft described the meetings as productive, with participants reaffirming their commitment to a bipartisan path forward. The CLARITY Act follows the earlier passage of the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin-focused bill signed into law by President Donald Trump in July , which laid the foundation for broader digital asset regulation. Together, the two bills form the centerpiece of Congress’s ongoing effort to create a coherent national framework for cryptocurrencies. Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a key sponsor of the market structure initiative, has also expressed confidence that Congress will pass the bill this year. Senator Cynthia Lummis is looking to have digital asset market structure legislation completed before the end of 2025. #CynthiaLummis #cryptolegislation https://t.co/brkZvGtCgH — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) August 21, 2025 Speaking at the SALT Wyoming Blockchain Symposium in August, Lummis said she expects the legislation to reach the president’s desk “before the end of the year — hopefully before Thanksgiving.” Senate Banking Chair Tim Scott, who previously set a September 30 target for finalizing the bill, has echoed similar optimism. “We’ve been working since June toward a markup,” Scott’s spokesperson said, emphasizing the thousands of pages of stakeholder feedback already reviewed. Scott believes the Senate “should not fall behind” after the House’s decisive action earlier this summer. Only 20% Expect CLARITY Act Passage by 2025 However, progress in the Senate has not been without setbacks. Internal divisions within both parties and the ongoing government shutdown have delayed the markup process. Senator John Kennedy (R-LA) has voiced skepticism, saying that he does not believe the committee is ready to move forward , citing unresolved questions about how much authority the crypto industry might gain under the new framework. @SenJohnKennedy says “we’re not ready” on the GOP crypto bill, raising doubts about the Senate’s plan to advance market structure legislation. #Crypto #USPolitics #cryptobill https://t.co/g3VFg6LKQ3 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) September 10, 2025 Meanwhile, a group of twelve Senate Democrats, led by Senators Gillibrand, Booker, and Warner, have urged Republicans to adopt a fully bipartisan drafting process . In a joint statement last month, they described digital assets as a $4 trillion global market requiring “mutual understanding” and equal participation from both parties. Despite the friction, industry optimism remains high. Armstrong described the recent bipartisan meetings as a “turning point,” while SEC Chair Paul Atkins has also called on lawmakers to accelerate the process , emphasizing the need for joint rulemaking between the SEC and CFTC. Source: Polymarket Still, uncertainty persists about the bill’s timeline. On the decentralized prediction market Polymarket, only about 20% of bettors believe the CLARITY Act will be signed into law by the end of 2025, a steep drop from 87% in mid-July.

Trump recently indicated to advisers that he was sympathetic to arguments of political persecution related to Zhao and others, one person said. Zhao pleaded guilty in November 2023 to failing to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program at Binance, resulting in his resignation as CEO and a $50 million fine. Binance itself was fined $4.3 billion as part of the settlement, one of the largest corporate penalties in U.S. history. U.S. District Judge Richard Jones sentenced Zhao to four months in prison in April 2024, far lighter than the 36 months sought by the Department of Justice. The pardon follows intense discussions within the White House that reportedly “ ramped up ” in October, with financial journalist Charles Gasparino reporting that “ people close ” to Zhao said Trump “ is leaning toward a pardon ” despite concerns about optics given the president’s business interests in crypto. Many Trump insiders believed “ the fraud case against Changpeng Zhao, known in the digital space simply as CZ, was pretty weak, and certainly not something that merited a felony charge and jail time. “ The post BREAKING: Donald Trump Pardons CZ – Is the BNB Price About to Skyrocket? appeared first on Cryptonews .",Altcoin News|Binance|CZ|Trump,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-10-23 15:28:22

53543137,612369,1761233403,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53543137.jpeg,Quantum Shock: Google’s Breakthrough Puts Bitcoin’s Encryption On Notice,https://bitcoinist.com/quantum-shock-googles-breakthrough-puts-bitcoins-encryption-on-notice/,"Google’s quantum team says its Willow processor ran a new algorithm called Quantum Echoes that solved a molecular-simulation task roughly 13,000× faster than the best classical methods on top supercomputers. Based on reports, the run is being presented as a verifiable quantum advantage and was published alongside technical notes from Google. Google Quantum Chip Beats Supercomputers The experiment used Willow hardware and an algorithm tailored to a specific scientific problem, not a general-purpose attack on everyday encryption. According to Google’s post, the work produces verifiable outputs that are useful for chemistry and materials research. That distinction matters because a speed win on one problem does not automatically mean the same device can run all quantum algorithms at the scale needed to break modern public-key systems. What That Means For Crypto Security experts warn that one well-known quantum routine, Shor’s algorithm, can in principle recover private keys from public keys used in signatures like ECDSA and Schnorr — the kinds of keys common in Bitcoin wallets. But running Shor at the scale that would threaten major blockchains requires error-corrected machines with far more qubits and stability than Willow currently has. Several analysts point out that the hardware gap remains large. What The Numbers Say Willow’s public figures show a device built for experimental advantage. Public commentary notes Willow’s qubit count and the specialized nature of the algorithm. By contrast, breaking a widely used signature scheme would likely need millions of logical qubits and robust error correction — a threshold that current machines do not meet. The practical takeaway is simple: this is a clear step forward in quantum research, but not a sudden collapse of existing crypto security. Experts Urge Faster Planning Based on reports , government and industry groups have already moved toward quantum-safe standards. The National Institute of Standards and Technology finalized early post-quantum algorithms and published FIPS or Federal Information Processing Standards guidance in 2024, giving organizations concrete replacements to study and adopt. That work gives a path to protect systems before a cryptographic break becomes practical. Still, many voices call for faster testing and deployment of hybrid schemes that combine current signatures with quantum-resistant alternatives. The Immediate Risk To Bitcoin For everyday Bitcoin users the near-term danger is limited. Funds kept behind addresses whose public keys have never been exposed on the ledger remain harder to target even if quantum power improves. But coins tied to reused or revealed public keys would be the weaker link once an adversary had the right quantum tools. Wallet providers, custodians, and node developers are watching these developments and weighing migration plans.

Here’s What to Expect After Approval,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-etfs-are-here-heres-what-to-expect-after-approval/,"A significant week lies ahead for the digital asset sector as attention turns to a series of final decision dates for multiple XRP spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) applications . Financial expert Levi Rietveld recently emphasized the scale of this development, noting that five separate issuers are awaiting final rulings from U.S. regulators within days—a moment he believes could mark a pivotal turning point for XRP’s institutional adoption . Multiple XRP ETF Decisions Expected This Week According to Rietveld, the upcoming decisions include applications from Bitwise, Canary Capital, WisdomTree, Franklin Templeton, and CoinShares, each scheduled between October 20 and October 25, 2025. These firms represent a cross-section of established asset managers and digital investment platforms, signaling growing institutional interest in offering exposure to XRP through regulated financial instruments. The #XRP ETF’s ARE HERE! #crypto #trading pic.twitter.com/I8IN1CWS8q — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 21, 2025 Comparison with Bitcoin’s ETF Impact Rietveld urged XRP investors to focus on the long-term implications rather than short-term market reactions. Drawing comparisons to Bitcoin’s trajectory following its spot ETF approvals, he reminded viewers that Bitcoin saw a surge in trading volume and capital inflows roughly one to two months after approval. He suggested that a similar pattern could unfold for XRP if approvals are granted, with substantial institutional funds potentially entering the market once trading begins. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Patience as the Key Strategy The analyst framed the current phase as one that rewards patience, describing it as a “holders game.” In his view, XRP investors who maintain their positions could benefit from the gradual inflow of institutional capital expected after ETFs begin trading on major exchanges. He stressed that market participants should expect a delayed reaction rather than an immediate spike, as liquidity builds and financial institutions integrate the new products into their portfolios. The broader market context also lends weight to Rietveld’s observations. Since the introduction of Bitcoin ETFs, digital asset managers have increasingly sought similar approvals for other major cryptocurrencies. If XRP ETFs receive regulatory clearance, it would mark the first time a non-Bitcoin or Ethereum token secures such recognition in the U.S. market. Analysts have noted that this could validate XRP’s role in institutional portfolios and potentially accelerate its integration into mainstream financial products. While outcomes will ultimately depend on regulatory decisions, the sequence of deadlines set for late October 2025 positions XRP at the center of one of the most closely watched developments in the crypto investment landscape this year.

This growth has been accompanied by an 18% increase in trading volume over the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinGecko. Related Reading: $1.7 Trillion Firm T. Rowe Price Seeks Approval For Crypto ETF Linked To Multiple Tokens The recent uptick in HYPE prices also coincides with Hyperliquid Strategies’ filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise $1 billion for a buyback of HYPE tokens. The company is expected to hold approximately 12.6 million HYPE tokens, valued at around $470 million, along with $305 million in cash reserves designated for additional token purchases. Key Resistance And Support Levels For Hyperliquid’s Price As of now, the HYPE price is trading at approximately $40.54, still 31% below its all-time high of $59 reached earlier this year. Moving forward, key price levels for Hyperliquid include closing the week above $40, which would convert this previous resistance into a short-term support level for potential further increases. Related Reading: Gold Rotation Impact: Bitwise Warns Bitcoin Could Skyrocket To $242,000 To the upside, additional resistance for the HYPE price may be encountered at $42, $46, and $50 before the altcoin can attempt to retest its $59 peak. Conversely, a support floor for Hyperliquid’s short-term price action is anticipated at $35, established over the past week, providing a buffer against potential new declines in price.

Understanding the nuances of each can enhance your gaming experience, whether you're at the roulette wheel or the slots. Deciding on a payment method is critical as it affects not only how you deposit and withdraw funds but also your overall gaming strategy and financial security. Here, we explore the unique advantages and considerations of both payment methods in online casinos. The Rise of Cryptocurrency in Online Gaming Cryptocurrencies have carved a niche in online gambling, appealing to those who value innovation and privacy. The quick processing times of crypto casino transactions mean players can start their gaming sessions without delays often associated with traditional banking methods. Moreover, the anonymity provided by blockchain technology ensures that players' financial details remain confidential. Online casinos that utilize blockchain for their games bring an added layer of fairness. The technology behind these games ensures that each game's outcome can be verified for fairness, fostering trust among users. Advantages of Sticking to Fiat Currencies Despite the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies remain the most common payment method in online casinos. They are widely accepted and offer users a sense of security through familiar transaction processes. Payments via credit cards, e-wallets, and bank transfers are straightforward and usually come with consumer protection, ensuring a safety net in dispute cases. However, fiat transactions can be slower and involve higher fees. Moreover, they might require more comprehensive ID verification, which could be a privacy concern for some users. Yet, fiat currencies offer undeniable stability. With regulated operations, traditional currencies protect users from the volatility often seen in cryptocurrency markets. Learn more about fiat transactions here. Why Some Gamers Prefer Cryptocurrency For many, the appeal of cryptocurrencies in online gambling lies in their speed and lower transaction fees. These factors allow for quicker access to winnings and reduced costs when playing online. Furthermore, owning a crypto wallet gives players complete control over their funds without the need for a middleman. The global nature of cryptocurrencies also means fewer geographical restrictions in gaming platforms. However, the price of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate significantly, and transactions, once made, cannot be reversed, which could pose a risk if not handled carefully. Fiat vs. Crypto: What's Best for You? Ultimately, the right choice depends on personal preferences and priorities. If reliability, consumer protection, and ease of use are your primary concerns, fiat currencies might be the better option. On the other hand, if you value prompt transactions and confidentiality, cryptocurrencies could be more suitable. It's worth noting that many online casinos now offer the flexibility to use both currencies, allowing players to optimize both benefits. Some innovative platforms even enable users to switch between fiat and crypto, providing a versatile gaming environment. The Future of Online Casino Payments The distinction between fiat and crypto is becoming increasingly blurred. With the introduction of stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and EURC, players can enjoy the best aspects of both payment methods. As technology progresses, we can expect more sophisticated solutions like DeFi-powered betting and NFT loyalty programs that could revolutionize online gambling payments further. The possibility of integrating multi-currency wallets into gaming platforms is already on the horizon, making the future of online casino play more exciting than ever. Choosing between fiat and crypto doesn't have to be a permanent decision. By understanding the benefits and limitations of each, you can select the option that best fits your gaming style and financial preferences, ensuring a rewarding and secure online casino experience.

How to Choose the Best Payment Method for Your Online Casino Play,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/10/fiat-or-crypto-how-to-choose-the-best-payment-method-for-your-online-casino-play,"Online casinos have never been more accessible (or more diverse) when it comes to how you pay and play. Whether you're spinning the reels, sitting at a blackjack table or trying your luck on live games, the way you fund your account matters. These days, players can stick with familiar fiat currencies like pounds, euros or dollars or step into the world of crypto payments with Bitcoin, Ethereum and stablecoins. Both options have their perks and both come with a few trade-offs. The real question isn't which one is ""better"" for your online casino ; it's which one fits your playing style best. Why crypto payments are taking off in online casinos A few years ago, the idea of gambling in a crypto casino might've sounded niche, something for hardcore blockchain fans or early adopters. But has quickly changed. Today, hundreds of online casinos accept crypto deposits and some are even built entirely on blockchain technology. So why the sudden rise? Speed and privacy are two big reasons. Crypto casino transactions can be processed within minutes. There is no waiting around for a bank transfer or card approval. And because you don't have to share sensitive banking details, you get an extra layer of anonymity that appeals to a lot of players. There's also the growing trend of provably fair gaming. Some crypto casinos online use blockchain to show that every spin, roll or card draw is completely random and verifiable. That transparency builds trust in a way traditional casinos can't always match. Sticking with fiat payments Of course, traditional payment methods aren't going anywhere. Fiat options like Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and even transfers are still the most widely used ways to find online casino accounts. They're familiar, convenient and supported everywhere. If you're new to online gaming, using your regular card or e-wallet is straightforward. You don't have to worry about exchange rates, crypto volatility or digital wallets. Fiat transactions also benefit from strong consumer protection. Licensed casinos operating under strict regulations offer chargebacks and dispute resolution options. If something goes wrong, like your withdrawal not arrived, there's usually a clear process to get help. But fiat has its frustrations. Withdrawals can take days to hit your account, especially if the casino has manual verification steps. Fees can add up, and you don't often need to provide detailed ID checks, which can feel intrusive for players who value privacy. Why some players prefer crypto Crypto on the other hand, offers a different kind of freedom. For starters, it's fast. Deposits and withdrawals can be nearly instant. You don't have to wait for bank hours or payment processors. That's a huge perk if you want to access your winnings quickly. Then there's privacy. With crypto, you control your own wallet . There's no bank, middleman and far less personal information shared with the casino. Fees are typically lower too. Some casinos even reward crypto users with exclusive bonuses, cashback offers or higher withdrawal limits. And because crypto operates globally, you can play on platforms that might not support your local currency. Of course, there are a few things to watch out for. The value of cryptocurrencies can fluctuate which means your deposit might be worth more (or less) tomorrow. And since blockchain transactions are irreversible, sending funds to the wrong address is a costly mistake. Which ones right for you? The truth is, there is no one-size-fits-all answer. It depends on what you care most about as a player. If you prioritize security, faimilairy and regulation, fiat still wins. It's supported everywhere, offers recourse if things go wrong and doesn't require you to understand blockchain technology. If you value speed, privacy and innovation, crypto might be the better fit. It's ideal for players who are comfortable managing their own wallets and want more control over their money. Many modern casinos actually support both, so you don't have to pick sides. Some players deposit with fiat but withdraw in crypto for faster cashouts, offering the best of both worlds. It's all about going with the option that works for you the best. The future of casino payments The line between fiat and crypto is getting blurrier every year. With the rise of stablecoins , like USDT, USDC and EURC, players can enjoy the stability of fiat currencies without giving up the speed and convenience of cryptocurrency. Casinos are also integrating multi-currency wallets and instant conversion tools, so you can deposit in fiat and switch to crypto inside the platform. Add in upcoming innovations like DeFi-powered betting and NFT loyalty programs and the future of online gaming looks more flexible and more exciting than ever before. Your move: fiat or crypto Whether you're team fiat or team crypto, the key is to choose the option that fits your comfort level and play habits. Fiat offers safety and familiarity, while crypto brings speed, privacy and innovation. In truth, you don't have to choose one forever; the best online casinos are giving players the freedom to use both.

The altcoin has formed its second local top at $300, marking the start of a potential double bottom that could send it back to pre-bull run lows. Yet, the privacy coin narrative remains strong.

Social sentiment shares a common belief: privacy represents more than a passing trend, but one of crypto’s foundational values. buying zcash at $300 is like buying bitcoin at $300 — Ansem (@blknoiz06) October 21, 2025 Zcash has found new relevance in this institution-led market cycle: Institutional use-cases need rails that offer privacy, yet are compliant with selective disclosure. Backing from the world’s largest digital asset manager further underscores the demand, with the launch of the Grayscale Zcash Trust giving TradFi markets regulated access to ZEC. ZEC Price Prediction: The Bull Run Hinges On This Support With a second stall around $300, a strong psychological resistance, Zcash appears to have formed a double top. ZEC / USDT 4-hour chart, double bottom meets bull flag. Source: TradingView. If fully realized, this classic reversal pattern could trigger a 50% drop back to the altcoin’s October low near $120, erasing much of the bull market’s gains. However, momentum indicators suggest strength rather than exhaustion. The RSI continues trending upward, while the MACD histogram is flattening out, both signs of building buy pressure. A broader bull flag structure may still be in play, with the current retest of its upper boundary as support pivotal for a bull run continuation. If confirmed, the flag breakout targets a 125% rally into new price discovery, eyeing $500. The recent pullback could simply be a shakeout of weak hands before Zcash’s next major leg higher. Near-term catalysts, like potential U.S. interest rate cuts next week, could give the Zcash price the fuel it needs to continue the rally.

In addition, all user data has been managed securely as per the privacy policy. Changpeng Zhao (CZ), CEO of Binance, was one of many notable crypto industry individuals whom users could privately chat on ReachMe. JUST IN: BNB Chain’s ReachMe paid chat platform, allowing users to message CZ, has permanently shut down. pic.twitter.com/0g11YMPEhD — BNN (@brainsnewsnets) October 23, 2025 Messages sent to CZ used to cost 1 BNB, which was over $400–$500 back then. The price was later dropped to 0.8 BNB in response to public feedback and demand. A short-lived experiment in blockchain-based, monetized communication has come to an end with the shutdown. ReachMe shuts down due to weak adoption and fairness concerns ReachMe was designed to provide secure, on-chain messaging by leveraging BNB Chain’s fast and low-cost transactions. The model attracted early adopters curious about direct, paid access to industry leaders. According to CZ, the platform was to control the number of messages and encourage more quality conversations. His goal is to adjust the price to maintain about 10 messages per day. This feature was also meant to create a new mode of communication within the Binance ecosystem. Using BNB as a payment method could increase its utility and demand for this crypto coin. However, after the launch, the price of BNB dropped by nearly 1%, indicating that broader market factors were influencing the value of this token more than the introduction of new applications. Questions of equity and transparency have arisen in response to the commercialization of one-on-one messaging with famous people. The strategy improved communication quality and cut down on spam. However, some users felt it made it harder and more expensive for the general public to get in touch with influential people. Even after the initial interest, the platform struggled to achieve sustained adoption. Meanwhile, recent trends indicate growing interest in blockchain-based social interactions. According to a 2025 Delphi Digital report, decentralized social platforms have experienced a 35% increase in active wallets over the past year, driven by tokenized incentives and the integration of NFTs.

According to the report, Türkiye's annual cryptocurrency trading volume has reached $200 billion. At this point, Türkiye has emerged as the largest crypto asset market in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. However, analysis revealed that cryptocurrency transaction volume in Türkiye is of a speculative nature rather than actual usage. “Türkiye's annual cryptocurrency transaction volume reached $200 billion. This is nearly four times the $53 billion volume of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and far exceeds the combined transaction volume of neighboring countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Morocco. However, the surge in trading volume in Türkiye is driven by speculative demand for altcoins, not real adoption. Unlike the UAE, where cryptocurrencies are moving from being primarily a speculative asset to being used as a practical payment solution, the vast majority of crypto volume in Türkiye is driven by an increase in speculative activity. Chainalysis also added in the report that Türkiye’s altcoin trading volume increased from an average of $50 million per day at the end of 2024 to $240 million by mid-2025. In contrast, stablecoin trading volume fell from $200 million to approximately $70 million during the same period. The report noted that this shift reflected investors shifting to “high-yield trading” aimed at short-term profits due to inflation and declines in the value of the Turkish lira. The report finally stated that institutional transactions predominated in the cryptocurrency market in Türkiye, while retail transactions decreased significantly. *This is not investment advice.

The decision came after over eleven months of lobbying, private meetings, and direct appeals that finally convinced the “crypto president” to sign the pardon on Wednesday, following CZ’s four-month prison sentence that was served after Binance pleaded guilty to violating U.S. anti-money-laundering laws. Sources close to the matter allegedly told the Wall Street Journal that CZ personally pushed efforts to improve ties between Binance and Trump’s family business, especially after World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto venture, launched earlier this year. Binance had reportedly been helping with liquidity infrastructure and backend tools, becoming one of the early backers of the project. Trump ends crypto war with White House statement WSJ says White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told them that:- “President Trump has exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. CZ, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency.” She added that “the Biden Administration’s war on crypto is over.” The deal barred Binance from operating in the U.S., forcing it to move most of its business offshore. The pardon now opens a potential path for Binance’s return to the American market, something the Journal says has been quietly planned for months. The company had spent almost a year pushing for CZ’s release and rehabilitation in Washington. Earlier this year, Binance brought on lobbyist Ches McDowell to help secure political support and convince lawmakers that CZ’s case had been exaggerated under Biden’s Justice Department. The hiring, along with multiple meetings between Binance representatives and Trump’s campaign officials, reportedly helped shape the president’s view that the prosecution was politically driven. Neither CZ nor Binance has made any public comment since the pardon was signed, but WJS says he has been advised to stay quiet until the company receives formal clearance from U.S. regulators to resume operations. Trump, meanwhile, is said to have told advisers that he sympathized with CZ’s argument of “political persecution.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

White House Confirms Pardon For Binance Founder White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated , “President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden Administration in their war on cryptocurrency.” Amid former President Joe Biden’s administration, CZ, pleaded guilty in 2023 to alleged violations of US anti-money-laundering (AML) laws and was serving a four-month prison sentence as part of a $4.3 billion settlement reached between Binance and the Department of Justice (DOJ). In April 2024, Zhao was sentenced to just four months in jail, despite federal prosecutors seeking a three-year prison term. The pardon effectively eliminates all remaining legal penalties against Zhao, who also stepped down from his position at Binance as part of the plea agreement. BNB Rallies Back Beyond $1,1000 White House Press Secretary Leavitt further emphasized to the Wall Street Journal that Trump’s decision signifies the end of what she described as the “Biden Administration’s war on crypto.” The announcement sparked a new rally for Binance Coin (BNB), which recovered the $1,100 mark after correcting down to $860 in the infamous October 10 crash. Notable buying demand has been evident in the BNB price since then. Binance Coin reached a new record of over $1,370 just three days after the flash crash in the broader crypto market.

The White House called it a rebuke to the prior administration’s crypto crackdown. Zhao faced no fraud charges or named victims in his case, making the pardon a symbolic gesture for deregulation. Zhao’s 2023 Conviction In November 2023, Zhao pleaded guilty to anti-money laundering violations. He served a four-month prison term in 2024 and paid a $50 million fine. Binance settled for $4.3 billion, and Zhao was banned from running the exchange. The case centered on compliance failures, not direct financial harm. Policy Shift Signaled The White House stated the pardon ends Biden-era crypto hostility. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt emphasized no fraud was alleged against Zhao. The move aligns with Trump’s pro-crypto stance, promising lighter regulation. Binance, still a major exchange, has not commented on the pardon’s impact. Industry and Market Context Analysts view the pardon as a signal of softer U.S. crypto oversight. Zhao, a key Binance shareholder, remains influential despite his operational ban. Industry reactions highlight relief, though some question the case’s severity. The pardon may boost confidence in crypto markets, already buoyed by $26 billion in 2025 ETF inflows.",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-10-23 15:56:30

We expect excellence. We give people room to build and the freedom to go deep. That’s the foundation of our culture and the reason Kraken keeps moving fast while others slow down. But high performance comes with self-awareness. The same drive that pushes people to do great work also makes them restless when it’s time for their next chapter. We want to make that transition as intentional as every other part of the Kraken experience. That’s why we built Sail Away . Sail Away is a voluntary offboarding program for Krakenites who decide it’s time for something new. It offers a paid transition period, continued benefits, and professional career support. It’s not a safety net. It’s a statement of respect. Freedom isn’t just something we talk about. It’s something we practice. We trust people to know when they’re in the right place, and when it’s time to move on. We believe in clarity. We’d rather help someone launch their next adventure with support and gratitude than pretend everything is fine. That’s what Sail Away represents: confidence in our people and confidence in our culture. If you leave Kraken, you leave with our respect and our backing. You stay part of a network of builders who have helped shape one of the most important missions in crypto. And just because you’re sailing away now doesn’t mean the journey with Kraken is over forever. It may not be the right place for you in this season, but seasons change. We keep the door open for those who’ve made a mark here, and we welcome the possibility of high-performing alumni returning in the future. If you stay, you’re choosing to be here for the right reasons — to build the future of finance. Culture is what happens when no one is watching. It’s the tone we set in how we treat each other and how we handle change. If you want to understand the heart of Kraken, read Kraken Culture Explained . It’s about freedom, accountability and results. Sail Away is one more way we live those values. If you’re looking for comfort, there are easier places to work.

It also features seamless mobile connectivity, making it easier than ever to manage crypto securely from anywhere. With a vibrant color touchscreen, anodized aluminum unibody, and open-source firmware, Trezor Safe 7 is built to offer transparent, long-term self-custody without compromising on usability or design. First Transparent Secure Element At the core of the device is TROPIC01, the world’s first transparent and auditable secure element. Unlike conventional secure elements that rely on undisclosed architecture, TROPIC01 allows the community to inspect, verify, and validate its design. This approach addresses a long-standing issue in crypto security: the need to trust proprietary hardware without insight into how it works. Quantum-ready Architecture Trezor Safe 7 is also designed with the future in mind. Its quantum-ready architecture means the device supports quantum-secure updates, ensuring the device’s integrity and trustworthiness over time. When networks transition to post-quantum security, hardware wallets will remain compatible and continue to function without requiring replacement. “Security has always been the foundation of everything we do at Trezor. With Trezor Safe 7, we’re introducing TROPIC01, the world’s first transparent and auditable secure element. It sets a new standard for both security and transparency in hardware wallets. For years, I believed quantum computers belonged to science fiction, but the pace of innovation is changing that. Within the next decade, Bitcoin and other blockchains will have to move to post-quantum algorithms. It’s not a question of if, but when. That’s why we built a quantum-ready bootloader into Safe 7. When the time comes, your device can be safely updated, even in a future where quantum computers pose a threat. Combining this quantum-readiness with TROPIC01 sets a new standard for open, future-proof security. For us, it’s always about protecting digital freedom with tools that are secure, usable, and transparent.” added Tomáš Sušanka, CTO at Trezor. Security Without Compromise Trezor Safe 7 applies a layered approach to secure crypto storage. It features dual secure elements — the transparent and auditable TROPIC01 chip and NDA-free EAL6+ secondary element — ensuring physical and cryptographic protection. Private keys are kept completely isolated from the host system, while all sensitive actions must be physically confirmed on a 2.5” high-resolution color LCD touchscreen . “At a time when convenience is pulling users toward custodians and ETFs, we believe it’s more important than ever to reinforce what self-custody really means — full control, without compromise,” said Matěj Žák, CEO at Trezor. “Trezor Safe 7 is our answer: the first hardware wallet with a fully auditable secure element, dual-chip architecture, and wireless design built for the long term. It reflects everything we stand for — transparency, usability, and trust that doesn’t ask for permission. With this device, we’re making the safest option also the most intuitive, and raising the bar for what users should expect from crypto security.” Designed for Modern Usability Trezor Safe 7 supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), magnetic Qi2-compatible wireless charging, and features a high-resolution color touchscreen. Bluetooth communication is secured via Trezor Host Protocol (THP), an open-source layer that ensures encrypted, authenticated, and private connections across mobile, desktop, and tablet. These hardware choices are paired with a robust aluminum unibody and Gorilla Glass protection, offering a seamless experience across mobile and desktop environments. Through the Trezor Suite platform, users can manage thousands of coins and tokens, trade, stake, and access third-party integrations — all in one interface. Trezor introduced the Safe 7 during a live event in Prague called Trustless by Design (TBD), giving the crypto community a first look at its new flagship. A full recording of the launch is available on the official Trezor YouTube channel. Engineered for Resilience Trezor Safe 7 features a durable aluminum unibody, Gorilla Glass 3 display, IP54 resistant against dust and splashes, and a long-lasting LiFePO4 battery that delivers 4× more charging cycles than standard lithium batteries. A Bitcoin-only version is also available, designed for users who prefer a focused, bitcoin-only experience. Trezor Safe 7 is priced at $249 (€249). The Charcoal Black and Bitcoin-only versions are now available for pre-order via the official Trezor e-shop , with Obsidian Green coming soon. Shipping is expected to begin in four weeks. A full range of dedicated accessories is also available, including a Magnetic Qi2-certified Wireless Charger (free gift for preorders), a form-fitting vegan leather Case for Trezor Safe 7, a Trezor Universal Case for secure storage of any Trezor model, a Privacy Screen Protector with a 28° viewing filter, and a durable braided USB-C charging cable. About Trezor Trezor is the original bitcoin hardware wallet company, founded in 2013.

First Transparent Secure Element At the core of the device is TROPIC01, the world's first transparent and auditable secure element. Unlike conventional secure elements that rely on undisclosed architecture, TROPIC01 allows the community to inspect, verify, and validate its design. This approach addresses a long-standing issue in crypto security: the need to trust proprietary hardware without insight into how it works. Quantum-ready Architecture Trezor Safe 7 is also designed with the future in mind. Its quantum-ready architecture means the device supports quantum-secure updates, ensuring the device’s integrity and trustworthiness over time. When networks transition to post-quantum security, hardware wallets will remain compatible and continue to function without requiring replacement. “Security has always been the foundation of everything we do at Trezor. With Trezor Safe 7, we're introducing TROPIC01, the world's first transparent and auditable secure element. It sets a new standard for both security and transparency in hardware wallets. For years, I believed quantum computers belonged to science fiction, but the pace of innovation is changing that. Within the next decade, Bitcoin and other blockchains will have to move to post-quantum algorithms. It’s not a question of if, but when. That's why we built a quantum-ready bootloader into Safe 7. When the time comes, your device can be safely updated, even in a future where quantum computers pose a threat. Combining this quantum-readiness with TROPIC01 sets a new standard for open, future-proof security. For us, it's always about protecting digital freedom with tools that are secure, usable, and transparent."" added Tomáš Sušanka, CTO at Trezor. Security Without Compromise Trezor Safe 7 applies a layered approach to secure crypto storage. It features dual secure elements — the transparent and auditable TROPIC01 chip and NDA-free EAL6+ secondary element — ensuring physical and cryptographic protection. Private keys are kept completely isolated from the host system, while all sensitive actions must be physically confirmed on a 2.5” high-resolution color LCD touchscreen. ""At a time when convenience is pulling users toward custodians and ETFs, we believe it's more important than ever to reinforce what self-custody really means — full control, without compromise,” said Matěj Žák, CEO at Trezor. “Trezor Safe 7 is our answer: the first hardware wallet with a fully auditable secure element, dual-chip architecture, and wireless design built for the long term. It reflects everything we stand for — transparency, usability, and trust that doesn’t ask for permission. With this device, we’re making the safest option also the most intuitive, and raising the bar for what users should expect from crypto security."" Designed for Modern Usability Trezor Safe 7 supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), magnetic Qi2-compatible wireless charging, and features a high-resolution color touchscreen. Bluetooth communication is secured via Trezor Host Protocol (THP), an open-source layer that ensures encrypted, authenticated, and private connections across mobile, desktop, and tablet. These hardware choices are paired with a robust aluminum unibody and Gorilla Glass protection, offering a seamless experience across mobile and desktop environments. Through the Trezor Suite platform, users can manage thousands of coins and tokens, trade, stake, and access third-party integrations — all in one interface. Trezor introduced the Safe 7 during a live event in Prague called Trustless by Design (TBD), giving the crypto community a first look at its new flagship. A full recording of the launch is available on the official Trezor YouTube channel. Engineered for Resilience Trezor Safe 7 features a durable aluminum unibody, Gorilla Glass 3 display, IP54 resistant against dust and splashes, and a long-lasting LiFePO4 battery that delivers 4× more charging cycles than standard lithium batteries. A Bitcoin-only version is also available, designed for users who prefer a focused, bitcoin-only experience. Trezor Safe 7 is priced at $249 (€249). The Charcoal Black and Bitcoin-only versions are now available for pre-order via the official Trezor e-shop , with Obsidian Green coming soon. Shipping is expected to begin in four weeks. A full range of dedicated accessories is also available, including a Magnetic Qi2-certified Wireless Charger (free gift for preorders), a form-fitting vegan leather Case for Trezor Safe 7, a Trezor Universal Case for secure storage of any Trezor model, a Privacy Screen Protector with a 28° viewing filter, and a durable braided USB-C charging cable.

The pardon follows a broader pattern of Trump granting clemency to high-profile figures, including former New York Rep. George Santos and several crypto executives. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt described the pardon as a corrective measure against what she termed the Biden administration’s war on cryptocurrency. “President Trump exercised his constitutional authority by issuing a pardon for Mr. Zhao, who was prosecuted by the Biden administration in their war on cryptocurrency,” Leavitt said. She emphasized that Zhao faced no allegations of fraud or identifiable victims and criticized the prior administration’s handling of the case. Background on Zhao’s guilty plea and Binance settlement Zhao, who co-founded Binance in 2017, had previously pleaded guilty in November 2023 in Seattle federal court to charges related to violating the Bank Secrecy Act. He admitted to failing to implement an effective anti-money-laundering program and to willfully violating US economic sanctions. Federal prosecutors alleged that Zhao sought to profit from the US market without implementing the controls required under US law. As part of the case, Binance itself pleaded guilty to conducting an unlicensed money-transmitting business, violating the International Emergency Powers Act, and conspiracy. The company agreed to pay roughly $4.3 billion in penalties to resolve the matter. Zhao, originally facing a three-year prison sentence requested by federal prosecutors, was sentenced in April 2024 to just four months in jail, reflecting the judge’s view that the recommended sentence was unusually harsh. Leavitt said, “The Biden Administration sought to imprison Mr. Zhao for three years, a sentence so outside Sentencing Guidelines that even the Judge said he had never heard of this in his 30-year career.” Impact on the cryptocurrency industry and Trump ventures The pardon comes amid a period of heightened interest in cryptocurrency by the Trump family. According to The Wall Street Journal, the Trump family’s crypto ventures have generated approximately $4.5 billion in revenue since the 2024 election, with Binance playing a supporting role in some of the family’s under-the-radar trading platforms. Zhao joins a growing list of crypto executives granted clemency by Trump, including Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht and employees of the BITMEX crypto exchange. Analysts note that these pardons may signal a broader pro-crypto stance by the president, contrasting with the previous administration’s enforcement-heavy approach. Leavitt also criticized the Biden administration, stating, “These actions by the Biden Administration severely damaged the United States’ reputation as a global leader in technology and innovation. The Biden Administration’s war on crypto is over.” Binance, now the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, continues to face scrutiny regarding its compliance practices, although Zhao’s pardon removes the personal legal risks he previously faced. Observers expect the move to influence both public perception of crypto enforcement in the US and the regulatory debate as the industry navigates increased government oversight. Zhao’s legal and professional legacy Despite legal challenges, Zhao remains a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency sector. His leadership helped Binance grow into a global trading platform with millions of users worldwide. While the pardon addresses his criminal conviction, the company itself remains responsible for ongoing compliance and regulatory obligations. The clemency underscores the interplay between politics, technology, and finance, as well as the high stakes involved in regulating a rapidly evolving crypto ecosystem.

The RSI at 34.81 suggests the token is near oversold territory, hinting at potential for a minor rebound. The MACD remains bearish but shows early signs of convergence, implying weakening selling momentum. VRA is trading below the mid-Bollinger Band ($0.00088), marking it as immediate resistance, while support lies near $0.00052. A breakout above $0.00088 could open the path toward $0.0010, whereas failure to hold above $0.00070 may lead to another decline. Overall, sentiment remains weak but cautiously corrective.

Verasity’s near-term outlook remains cautiously neutral with a slight bearish bias. The 4-hour and 1-day charts show the token consolidating between $0.00069 and $0.00073, reflecting indecision after sustained downward pressure. The tightening Bollinger Bands indicate reduced volatility, suggesting that a breakout could occur soon. If VRA manages to close above $0.00073, it may trigger a short-term rally toward $0.00078–$0.00080. However, continued rejection below this zone could push the price back toward $0.00068 or lower. The MACD’s flat structure and weak RSI imply limited momentum, so traders should expect range-bound movement until volume and market sentiment improve. Is VRA a good investment? Verasity has a compact roadmap from 2017, when the project started, with completed milestones. Investing in Verasity (VRA) may offer potential benefits, especially given its unique technology for combating ad fraud and growing ecosystem. Recent price trends show volatility, with both upward and downward movements in the crypto market. Analysts suggest that VRA could reach significant values by 2030, but market risks remain, warranting careful consideration before investing. Can Verasity go to $1? Reaching $1 for Verasity (VRA) would require a massive market capitalization increase, given its current low price. While bullish adoption, increased demand, and utility expansion could drive growth, the sheer supply makes $1 highly unlikely in the near future. A realistic target would be $0.01–$0.10 with strong market momentum. How much is VRA worth in 2025? VRA is currently worth $0.0007137 as of the time of press. Can Vra reach 10 cents? Strong market conditions, adoption, and increased demand for Verasity (VRA) technology could lead to its reaching $0.10 . VRA could achieve this target if bullish trends, partnerships, and token utility improve. However, broader market sentiment and tokenomics will determine whether it sustains such a price level. How high can the VRA coin go? Based on statistical predictions, Verasity (VRA) could reach approximately $ 0.0007176 by 2025, $0.0021 by 2026, and potentially $0.0153 by 2031, assuming continued adoption and market growth. However, these forecasts are subject to market volatility and should be approached cautiously. Is VRA a safe investment? Investing in VRA (Verasity) is speculative and carries risks, including recent negative returns. However, its growing adoption in digital advertising and ability to secure significant funds show potential. With less than a 16% chance of financial distress in the next two years, it may be promising, but requires careful personal research and analysis. Does VRA have a good long-term future? VRA has the potential for long-term growth, driven by its unique video monetization and gaming features. However, its success depends on market adoption and competition in the evolving digital content landscape.

Despite the downward trend, certain BTC investors remain unshaken by this negative action, as evidenced by a robust buying pressure from the group. Smart Money Is Moving Sharply Into Bitcoin Amid the ongoing bearish performance of Bitcoin’s price, key investors are making their presence known once again in the burgeoning market. Alphractal, an advanced investment and on-chain data analytics platform, has outlined optimistic behaviors among investors. This optimistic behavior is observed particularly in the midst of wallet addresses holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC, which are considered mid-sized whales . After examining their activity, the platform revealed that these mid-size whales have entered a phase of intense accumulation. According to the platform, the intense buying spree is a crucial development that demands close attention. With these strategic players steadily increasing their holdings during market volatility, it may imply that mid-tier investors are positioning themselves ahead of a potential upward surge in price. One major reason Alphractal has declared this signal critical to monitor is due to its impact in previous scenarios in past market cycles. When the BTC mid-size whales began to accumulate in 2021, it set off a parabolic rise in the price of Bitcoin. However, when this cohort ceased their heavy accumulation, the bear market went off soon after, underscoring the significance of these investors. A similar pattern was also spotted at the end of the 2017 bull market cycle, just after the market reached its top . During this period, accumulation was halted and a long correction was triggered. Delving into the cohort’s action, Alphractal highlighted that whether these entities have paused or simply slowed down their purchasing is yet too soon to tell. However, as long as the accumulation keeps increasing, it’s still an indication that Bitcoin is headed in the right direction. 2025 Cycle Shifting From Past Cycles’ Pattern Comparing the current cycle to a previous one is crucial in determining market direction, as history often repeats itself. Market pundit and the founder of Alphractal, Joao Wedson, ’s latest research reveals the disparity between the 2025 cycle and previous ones. According to the expert, when viewed from a 30-day perspective, the ATHs in 2017 and 2021 coincided with significant purchasing pressure peaks. Nonetheless, the 2025 cycle appears very different, exhibiting weaker and more subdued demand far from the euphoric spikes recorded in the past. While the founder is focused on opportunities, he will not be spending hours debating whether the ATH has happened or not. By doing so, Wedson will not miss the setups forming right now underneath the bearish weather. “And that’s exactly why we should take what the data is showing a bit more seriously this time,” Wedson added. Even if many analysts still believe that Bitcoin is in a bear market , Wedson has cautioned that the price will probably respond positively at some point.",Bitcoin News|Alphractal|bitcoin|Bitcoin Mid-Size Whales|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Joao Wedson,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 17:00:21

What began as a scattered rumor has evolved into a coherent narrative, apparently backed by detailed commentary from Ripple Bull Winkle, who states that a strategic accumulation process is underway. Whether this moment becomes historic will depend on execution, and the market is already positioning itself accordingly. Strategic Accumulation and Institutional Momentum According to Ripple Bull Winkle, “the numbers don’t lie.” He outlines a breakdown of capital inflows: two hundred million from SBI Holdings, two hundred million from Ripple Labs itself, and six hundred million from private investors, totaling one billion dollars. He states further: “Those funds are slated to buy XRP within 10 days of being received.” If valid, this compressed timeline would signal not just intent, but urgency. Reports from major outlets confirm that Ripple Labs is indeed spearheading a $1 billion-plus treasury vehicle to accumulate XRP. JUST DROPPED: This XRP Moment Will Go Down in History $1 billion in motion. 10-day trigger. The moment utility meets liquidity. Full breakdown down below pic.twitter.com/nu1gcBtKxL — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) October 22, 2025 Why This Matters: Utility Meets Liquidity This initiative appears timed at a crossroads. With Ripple’s regulatory challenges largely resolved, the firm’s ability to expand institutional adoption of XRP has improved. The formation of a dedicated treasury vehicle signifies a shift: from fragmented holdings to a large-scale strategic operation. Analysts note that the price of XRP is central to Ripple’s broader strategy, as the firm holds substantial token reserves. What makes the accumulation special is the convergence of liquidity (dollar capital lined up) and utility (an increasingly clear pathway for XRP in global payments, institutional exposure, and possibly public market structures). The Ten-Day Trigger and the Market’s Reaction Ripple Bull Winkle’s countdown-style timeline, “within 10 days”, is significant. He states: “Traders front-run that. Liquidity desk. They prep for this.” If large investors indeed deploy capital on this timeframe, portfolios, order books, and market makers may respond ahead of execution. The narrative of “compressed time” is particularly relevant: he warns, “most retail traders, they’re just staring at the chart, meanwhile, he argues that major participants will act, and the public might lag. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Separating Operational Support from Market Buy-Pressure An important nuance in the commentary: part of the capital is described as “operational runway, not market buy pressure.” Here, Bull Winkle is distinguishing funds meant to acquire XRP for strategic treasury purposes and liquidity intended purely for driving the market price. He emphasizes that this is not just a speculative buy-out; it’s a structural step. Meanwhile, the commentary acknowledges that separate from this one-billion-dollar accumulation is another bucket: “$300 million XRP that’s coming in is separate from all this”, a reference to further token commitments by insiders. Implications & Risks The implications are multi-fold. If the accumulation proceeds, early movers may see outsized gains. Institutional exposure could deepen, and XRP may enter a new phase as a liquidity token rather than a speculative altcoin. On the flip side, if the execution falters (timing delays, regulatory setbacks, market resistance), the narrative might backfire. The compressed time window may raise expectations — and heighten risks of disappointment. In summary, what Ripple Bull Winkle frames as “the moment utility meets liquidity” could indeed mark a defining chapter for XRP — provided the capital deployment aligns with the timeline and the ecosystem supports the transition. For traders, institutions, and observers, the next ten days may feel pivotal. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

According to sources familiar with the matter, this step could increase tensions between the US and China and pave the way for new customs duties. As relations between the world's two largest economies have become increasingly strained in recent weeks, the move is seen as an attempt by the US to strengthen its position ahead of a planned meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping as part of an international meeting in South Korea next week. The investigation could reportedly be announced tomorrow by the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. This section gives the U.S. administration the authority to investigate foreign countries' trade practices and, if necessary, take retaliatory action.

Trump and Xi are expected to meet face-to-face at an international summit in South Korea on October 30. Under the 2020 trade agreement, China pledged to purchase $200 billion worth of additional goods and services from the US, provide easier market access for American companies, and protect intellectual property rights.

The lead has reinforced Bitcoin’s dominance across the crypto landscape with roughly 59% over Ethereums 12%. Despite steady interest from institutional investors in Ethereum assets, Bitcoin continues to receive more inflows into its ETF products, currently leading with over $146 billion in total net assets, compared to Ethereum’s approximately $25 billion in total net assets. BTC market dominance stands at 59% as it leads in ETF inflows Following weeks of solid inflows from the beginning of this month, which saw Bitcoin Spot ETFs record up to $197.8 million in cumulative net inflows on October 9, the U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETF has recorded a net outflow of $101.29 million today. Still, the cumulative net inflow remains positive, with $61.87 billion as of today, based on SoSoValue data . Source: CoinMarketCap ; Bitcoin dominance over time Bitcoin’s dominance has been reinforced this year, with over 59.3% of the market share today, compared to 12.6% for Ethereum and 28.1% for the rest of the cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin briefly lost its dominance to the rest of the crypto markets in 2018 and 2022, when it faced bearish moments, shedding its dominance to an average of 35% during both periods. BTC has, however, peaked ever since the bearish momentum in 2022, reaching new all-time highs. Currently, BTC is up 1.43% at $109,603.90 at the time of publication, with trading volumes exceeding $64 billion and a market cap of $2.18 trillion, reflecting continued institutional engagement. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust leads in inflows today with $73.63 million, pushing its dominance against Fidelity’s FBTC and Grayscale’s GBTC ETFs. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) has recorded a net outflow of $56.56 million today, alongside Grayscale’s GBTC, which has a net outflow of $56.63 million. However, the cumulative net inflow for U.S. BTC ETFs remains positive at $61.87 billion. The strong momentum across BTC ETFs and its dominance comes as the token trades near all-time highs realized at the beginning of this month at $126,198.07, according to CoinMarketCap data . Institutional flows pivot to Bitcoin after brief Ethereum ETF surge in July Ethereum ETFs briefly matched BTC inflows in July, but that trend has already shifted towards BTC. In July, Ethereum ETFs recorded more than $1.8 billion in inflows in a single week compared to BTC’s $70 million during the same period. CryptoRank analysis reveals that spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a combined $15 billion in net inflows, compared to roughly $40 billion for BTC, between April 2024 and October 2025. Source: CryptoRank ; Combined cumulative inflows for ETH and BTC since April 2024 U.S. Spot Ethereum ETFs recorded a daily net outflow of 18.77 million today based on SoSoValue data . Still, the cumulative total net inflow remains positive at $14.57 billion, which is relatively low compared to BTC’s $61.87 billion. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) is the only fund that recorded positive flows, adding $110.71 million, compared to the other two dominant ETFs. Grayscale’s ETHE recorded an outflow of $33.46 million while Fidelity’s FETH saw $49.46 million leave the trust fund. The momentum in August saw Ethereum ETFs rise, with total net assets increasing to $29.9 billion, and daily trading volumes surging to $41 billion. The total net asset has, however, reduced this month to $25.81 billion.

The financing carries 0% interest and opens with a $10 million tranche. In a statement shared with Cryptonews.com, the company said over 90% of the proceeds will be used to acquire ETH that will support validator and attestation infrastructure. How Republic Technologies Allocates Funding The structure of the facility removes mark-to-market collateral requirements, which prevents margin calls and provides additional capital flexibility. Republic added that similar facilities in the market typically charge 8–10% interest and require greater collateral coverage. Unlike firms that hold digital assets as passive balance-sheet items, Republic integrates its ETH treasury with operational validator infrastructure that generates attestations to secure Ethereum. This would create an income-producing treasury model that links blockchain participation with financial returns. The company refers to this integrated system as “DAT++,” which connects ETH holdings with validator-driven earnings. Republic also employs structured ETH accumulation methods called “Synthetic Mining.” According to the company, these strategies have generated weekly returns near 1.75%, equivalent to annualized returns of 80% to 100%. The firm said it is partnering with QCP Capital to design and execute these strategies and continues to onboard validator infrastructure providers to broaden income channels. Republic Technologies is pleased to announce a strategic partnership with @FalconXGlobal , a leading digital asset prime brokerage, to provide ETH liquidity and execution support as we advance our validator infrastructure and ETH-denominated treasury. https://t.co/2goET1QfkF — Republic Technologies (@republictech_io) September 12, 2025 Intensifying Crypto Treasury Competition Chief Executive Officer Daniel Liu said his professional background in energy and infrastructure influenced Republic’s approach. “When introduced to Ethereum infrastructure and ETH treasury strategies, many recognized parallels to oil decades ago—as a foundational asset with outsized potential,” Liu said. By directly linking ETH holdings to validator operations, Republic positions its treasury as an active component of Ethereum’s ecosystem, showing a growing trend among companies seeking yield and operational exposure rather than static asset storage. As the competition intensifies, the next stage could see crypto treasuries functioning more like digital infrastructure funds, using ETH and other network assets not just for liquidity reserves, but as productive resources that reinforce the systems they operate within.

After experiencing a significant decline over recent weeks, the token appears to be consolidating within a narrow range, signaling cautious optimism. Notably, XRP is showing a modest recovery but remains locked in a long-term downtrend, given that key resistance at $2.48 has historically capped rallies, triggering selling pressure, according to market analyst LAHNO. Therefore, surpassing this level could spark a broader reversal, while failure to break it may stall further gains, leaving XRP at a critical crossroads. On the other hand, XRP’s $2.358 level has emerged as critical support, repeatedly attracting buyers and halting further declines. Why is this level of key interest? Well, a decisive break below could reignite the bearish trend and push prices lower. This tug-of-war between support and resistance highlights the market’s indecision, with sentiment caught between cautious optimism and persistent downside pressure. Specifically, XRP’s current trading pattern reflects a market in consolidation, navigating between critical support at $2.358 and resistance near $2.48. SEC Signals Crypto-Friendly Shift with Modernized Securities Approach In a significant development, SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s recent statements, highlighted by market analyst Xaif Crypto, indicate that the Securities and Exchange Commission is taking steps to modernize the country’s securities laws to better accommodate digital assets. This update signals a potential turning point in the regulatory landscape, which has long been criticized for being reactive rather than proactive. Notably, Chair Atkins signaled a shift at the SEC from an ‘enforcement-first’ approach to a forward-looking framework, clarifying how securities laws apply to crypto, stablecoins, and digital assets. This modernization aims to foster innovation while safeguarding investors. Therefore, these developments could transform how digital assets are regulated in the U.S. Clearer guidelines, such as the GENIUS Act, may ease legal uncertainty for exchanges, DeFi platforms, and token issuers. By taking a proactive approach, the SEC signals it aims to enable innovation rather than hinder it, potentially accelerating the growth of compliant crypto products and services. Conclusion XRP sits at a pivotal crossroads. A break above $2.48 could spark a broader rebound, while a drop below $2.358 would reinforce the long-term bearish trend, meaning caution should not be thrown to the wind as the altcoin tests this critical support-resistance zone. On the other hand, the SEC’s move toward a forward-looking, innovation-friendly approach marks a turning point for the U.S. crypto market. By modernizing securities laws to cover digital assets, the agency is reducing legal uncertainty, fostering innovation, and boosting institutional confidence while maintaining investor protection.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-23 17:21:12

This shift comes alongside a strong focus on an emerging cryptocurrency, Little Pepe, expected to see exponential growth. Tracking the Path of Ethereum and Bitcoin Ethereum has recently made a strong rebound from its low at $3,800, now testing the $4,100 resistance level. This level has been a significant point of contention since August, with outcomes here likely to set the tone for future price movements. Should Ethereum secure a position above this mark, potential targets could rise to $4,265 and possibly up to $4,800, contingent on market dynamics and trader sentiment. Meanwhile, Bitcoin maintains a solid performance with its price currently stable around $109,131, following a 2.53% intraday gain. The market cap for Bitcoin now stands at a staggering $2.2 trillion, with a notable increase in volume by 66.61% reaching $58.87 billion. Traders are closely watching the $108,000 to $113,000 range, anticipating a potential breakout towards $120,000. Introducing Little Pepe: A Potential Market Disruptor Amid these market movements, a new cryptocurrency named Little Pepe has begun to make waves, particularly after its successful audit which reflected no critical security flaws and received a score of 81.55 out of 100 from FreshCoins.io. Offering features such as zero taxes and a solid security framework, Little Pepe stands out as a strong contender in the crypto space. Currently in its 13th stage of presale, Little Pepe has already amassed over $27.2 million from earlier stages, indicating strong market interest and investor confidence. With each token priced at $0.0022 in this stage, the value is anticipated to grow significantly, particularly with the unique positioning as a layer 2 solution for meme coins which promises lower fees and enhanced transaction speeds. Community Engagement and Future Prospects To further fuel its growth and market presence, Little Pepe is conducting a $777k giveaway, enhancing community engagement and drawing more attention to its market entry. This strategic move, coupled with robust technical foundations and a clear vision, positions Little Pepe as a potential powerhouse in the evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

This comes as market sentiment shifts from fear towards optimism. While XRP continues to demonstrate resilience, newer projects are rising with stronger momentum. One such project drawing massive investor attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . MUTM is now in Phase 6 of its presale at $0.035 per token and already over 70% sold out. Mutuum Finance has been ranked among the best cryptos to buy now. It’s innovative dual-lending model has been a key selling point. While XRP shows potential for more gains, market experts predict that MUTM could benefit from its strong fundamentals and real utility. This will make it the next major crypto to deliver 25x returns. XRP to Hit $300B Market Cap XRP is enjoying mounting speculation. Analysts predict that its market cap could reach $300 billion. The forecast highlights the role of XRP in construction of the digital asset economy as the institutionalization of it continues, more ETFs are approved, and the company keeps expanding its business of providing cross-border payment services. XRP recently crashed to $1.27. It has since recovered to $2.48. Growing momentum could push price higher to $5 by the end of the year. Mutuum Finance is also rising in 2025 within the DeFi market. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Grows Like Wildfire Mutuum Finance (MUTM) remains one of the best cryptos to buy now, a sure bet for anyone looking for what crypto to buy in 2025. The project’s demand is increasing exponentially, and over 17,370 investors have invested a total of more than $17.75 million in its presale. Investor confidence remains the highest among large investors, demonstrating increased confidence in the long-term prospects of the project. In the last 24 hours alone, the leading investors have bought $510, $472, $470, $396, $208 of MUTM tokens, indicating increased attraction to early adoption. With this increased action, MUTM is among the best options for investors seeking to accumulate growth in DeFi and a clear example of what crypto to buy with early-stage upside. Mutuum Finance also encourages community interaction by means of its leaderboard reward system, rewarding and highlighting active members. The leading investor is rewarded daily with a $500 MUTM reward, as long as they’ve bought once within a 24-hour cycle. This gamification method has successfully fueled presale traction and community interaction, cementing MUTM as one of the best cryptos to buy now for early investors with high return on investment potential. Lending and Borrowing Protocol Launch Nears Later in the year, Mutuum Finance is poised to reach one of its largest milestones, launching its decentralized lending and borrowing protocol . Version 1 (V1) will be available for release in Q4 2025 on the Sepolia Testnet and will feature key DeFi elements like liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and a Liquidator bot. Both ETH and USDT will be natively supported at launch to lend, borrow, and collateralize, providing a fast, scalable, and secure multi-asset trading experience. Ripple (XRP) is steadily on the rise, yet Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is catching up quickly. Priced at $0.035 and over 70% sold out in presale stage 6, MUTM has already raised $17.75 million from 17,340+ investors. Its two-way lending protocol and upcoming Sepolia Testnet (V1) launch make it a leading DeFi project. Access the Mutuum Finance presale today before the next price surge.

The wallets then sent the tokens to an exchange, putting more pressure on MET during early trading. Wallets connected to Trump’s crypto team were among the top 5 recipients of the Meteora airdrop . On-chain data from Arkham Intelligence pointed to three addresses connected to the Trump team, which received $4.2M in MET tokens. Several addresses connected to the Official Trump (TRUMP) meme token team received MET for providing liquidity on Meteora. The wallets immediately sent the tokens to OKX. | Source: Arkham Intelligence The wallets were involved with the Official Trump Meme token. The tokens were then immediately sent to an intermediary address , then to the OKX hot wallet. The wallets were eligible for MET for their activity in supplying liquidity to the TRUMP token trading pair. TRUMP caused a trading record on Meteora in early 2025, putting the DEX in the lead among all Solana trading venues. The activity singled out the TRUMP team’s wallets to become top MET recipients. However, the team did not hold onto the token, instead increasing the selling. Meteora’s MET slides in the first hours of trading MET launched with a price of $0.68, later sliding to $0.51. MET followed the path of other big airdrops, which fell soon after launching. Top 5 whales realized profits, with the biggest wallet selling $669K on decentralized markets. MET is traded on most Solana DEX, with OKX being its most prominent centralized market. Most of the trading activity still hinges on two Meteora trading pairs. MET decentralized pairs saw immediate selling as early whales started cashing out. | Source: DexScreener MET tokens have currently flowed mostly into top holder wallets, with extremely limited selling from KOLs. In the early stages of trading, the MET token holder structure matches the tokenomics map released recently. According to Bubblemaps, one entity received $10M worth of MET, possibly the biggest single airdrop allocation of the year. MET tokens were distributed to Meteora liquidity providers and traders, JUP token stakers, holders of M3M3 tokens, and other ecosystem activities. The snapshot was on June 30 for the Season 1 distribution. Season 2 is to be announced. Can MET recover? The rapid initial selling of MET signals an expectation that the price discovery will take the asset lower. However, as MET slid, a whale spent $3M USDC to scoop up more tokens. Meteora remains one of the most active Solana DEXs, producing $5.2M in fees. The DEX still had its peak day in February 2025, with $59.83M in fees linked to meme token trading and especially TRUMP and MELANIA. Meteora still gets a boost from the inflows of USDC on Solana, potentially offering significant liquidity. Meteora’s TVL rose to over $898M and stabilized at a higher baseline in the past few months. One of the expectations for MET is to go through an early crash, then recover its past levels if buyers return. MET was sold as high as $1.17 during its IEO on BitMart, which raised only around $42K. Most of the token distribution will hinge on the airdrop and the behavior of whales. Get seen where it counts.

The vote on his record-breaking pay will happen at Tesla’s annual meeting in Austin on November 6. The call, which started calmly, turned heated when Elon brushed through numbers to chat about his usual tech dreams: AI, humanoid robots, and self-driving software. But for all the futuristic talk, the short-term numbers were less exciting. Adjusted earnings landed at 50 cents per share, missing the 54-cent estimate. Revenue, however, climbed to $28.1 billion, beating expectations of $26.37 billion. The company’s automotive revenue jumped 6% year over year, rising from $20 billion to $21.2 billion. The uptick came largely from buyers rushing in before federal EV tax credits expired, a tailwind that may not repeat in the next quarter. Analysts dissect Tesla’s Q3 report and forecasts Colin Langan from Wells Fargo kept an underweight rating and a brutal $120 price target, suggesting a 73% downside from Tesla’s last close. He said Tesla threw out “an array of promises for 2026, including robots, semitruck ramps in the second half of 2026, and fully autonomous cybercabs by Q2 2026.” But he warned the company’s “core business is deteriorating” while Robotaxi and Optimus are likely to take longer to scale. At UBS, analysts slapped a sell rating with a $247 target, roughly 44% below Tesla’s market value. They said Elon’s team gave “very little in terms of near-term outlook,” calling it “purposeful.” They argued Tesla is trying to move from being a car company to an AI company, but the market already values the AI side at around $900 billion, which leaves little room for mistakes. Jefferies was less harsh, keeping a hold rating and $300 target, saying Tesla had a “slight EBIT and margin miss after $238 million in non-recurring charges,” but strong free cash flow of $4 billion, boosted by a $2.1 billion working capital inflow. The firm said Tesla’s auto business no longer drives valuation but continues to fund future AI and robotics projects. Wall Street splits on Elon’s $1T payday and AI narrative Barclays called it “irrelevant that Tesla missed EPS,” assigning an equal weight rating and a $350 target. The bank said Elon’s focus is now clearly on autonomy and robots, not traditional vehicles. Goldman Sachs maintained a neutral rating and a $400 target, expecting earnings growth to come from autonomy and robotics, though warned that Elon might be too optimistic in a client note sent on Friday. Meanwhile, Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley, one of Elon’s most vocal supporters, gave Tesla an overweight rating with a $410 target, roughly 7% below its recent close. Jonas said “margins were in line” while “$4 billion in free cash flow was triple consensus,” adding Tesla is “navigating a dignified exit from the steering-wheel-having auto business.” Adam said Tesla’s fate now hinges on Elon’s ability to “steal the fire on autonomy” amid competition from the Mag 7 tech group. Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner took the most optimistic tone, raising his target slightly from $435 to $440 per share and keeping a buy rating. He said Elon “is clearly dialed in,” adding that the passing of his compensation package “will be important in ensuring that continues.” Emmanuel said Robotaxi and Optimus are progressing slower than expected but added that the next version of Full Self-Driving software (v14) could mark a turning point.

This unexpected move has sparked intrigue among investors and traders. The article will explore which cryptocurrencies are poised for growth during this period of uncertainty. Outset PR , a crypto-native firm that blends data analysis with communication strategy, powers this piece. With a sharp eye on trends and timing, Outset PR helps blockchain projects convert critical moments into enduring visibility. Bitcoin Steady with Eyes on Higher Levels Source: tradingview Bitcoin is moving steadily, trading between just over one hundred two thousand dollars and just over one hundred fifteen thousand dollars. It's showing resilience, with potential to climb to the nearest resistance at one hundred twenty-two thousand dollars, which means it could rise by around seven percent. The current simple moving averages suggest stability, while the Relative Strength Index indicates it’s not overbought. If momentum builds, Bitcoin might aim for the second resistance at one hundred thirty-four thousand dollars, a potential increase of about twenty percent. Over the past six months, Bitcoin has grown by over fifteen percent, hinting at its promising upward path. Presenting Yourself Without Overspending: How Outset PR Optimizes PR Budgets and Delivers Tangible Results The purpose of any PR campaign is to boost brand visibility. Traditionally, this has meant securing as many publications as possible, often with unpredictable outcomes. It was difficult to know how many readers would actually see a story, leaving much of PR to guesswork. Actually, it had been guesswork until analysts of Outset PR developed Syndication Map —a proprietary tool that identifies which outlets attract the most traffic and where a story is likely to achieve the strongest syndication lift. Senior Media Analyst Maximilian Fondé explains: If a company needs a top list article, we filter the table for media that publish this format, cross-check costs and placement conditions, and know within minutes which outlets to pitch. Over time, that builds into a comprehensive database of crypto-friendly publishers – something other players in the industry don't have right now. Smarter Campaigns, Lower Costs Campaigns built with Syndication Map are not about mass reach for its own sake. They are carefully crafted to serve specific goals. By narrowing the focus to the most effective outlets, Outset PR reduces unnecessary spending on low-impact publications. Another key factor is communication. Outset PR’s dedicated Media Relations team, led by Anastasia Anisimova , has earned the trust of leading outlets through professionalism and genuine relationships. Sincerity and friendliness are our core principles, earning us the trust of numerous media outlets. Unfortunately, not all agencies in our industry prioritize friendliness in their communications. Extended Reach Through Syndication Outset PR campaigns also achieve more visibility than clients initially pay for. Articles are frequently republished across aggregators and platforms such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square, extending exposure far beyond the original placement. Well-placed articles can achieve up to ten times the outreach of the original post. The case of StealthEX demonstrates this effect clearly: targeted tier-1 pitching led to 92 republications across outlets including CoinMarketCap, Binance Square, and Yahoo Finance, generating a total outreach of over 3 billion. Outset PR Sets a New Standard Pitching to a major outlet like Cointelegraph still has value, but syndication often delivers far greater reach at a lower cost. Outset PR has mastered this strategy, combining proprietary tools, strong media relations, and syndication opportunities to deliver results backed by numbers. Ready to make your budget work smarter?

In the post, Specter said Dogecoin is showing a green bullish dot on the daily chart, along with an RSI breakout. He described the move as “incredible” and said the coin looks ready to rise again. His chart shows that Dogecoin is now breaking past a level that had been holding it down for a while. Specter suggests that the primary focus is now on how the RSI has broken upward. The analyst pointed out this change as a bullish indicator that Dogecoin could move higher in the short term. The daily candlestick chart shows a clean upward push from the lower support area, hinting that momentum is returning to the coin. Shan Specter Identifies Dogecoin RSI Breakout In his X post, Shan Specter wrote, “Incredible! Dogecoin is showing a green bullish dot on the daily chart with an RSI breakout. The main target is $0.40. Dogecoin is poised to go higher. Hang in there, everyone.” Related Reading: Economist Explains The Reality Behind XRP Price Reaching $100,000, It Can’t Overtake Bitcoin The green bullish dot and RSI breakout together suggest the first strong signal of a possible new upward trend. On the chart, the RSI line has broken through a key level, which usually happens before a price increase. Specter’s chart also highlights how Dogecoin’s price is forming a triangle shape, with the breakout arrow pointing upward toward the next price zone. By sharing this analysis, Specter highlighted that the coin’s setup is improving and that it could soon test higher areas if the pattern continues. The tone of his post was positive and encouraging, indicating that he believes the chart signals more room for growth. Price Targets Set At $0.40 And $1.00 In the same post, Specter listed two targets for the Dogecoin price. The first target is $0.40, which he marked as the primary goal for this current RSI breakout. His chart includes an arrow pointing toward that level, suggesting it is the next key point if the upward move continues. The price area around $0.40 is shown in red on his chart, marking it as a critical resistance zone. Related Reading: Dogecoin 3rd Cycle Explosion: Analyst Revels The Only Difference From Last Two Cycles The second target is $1.00, which Specter suggests is still possible if the breakout gains more strength. His chart shows a clear upward path that stretches beyond the first target toward the $1 mark. He didn’t give a time frame for this move, but the setup remains intense and worth watching. Specter’s post draws attention because it gives a direct view of Dogecoin’s current daily price action. With the RSI now breaking higher and both targets marked, the update suggests Dogecoin may be entering a more active phase again.

53547556,612265,1761242458,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53547556.jpeg,Cardano Foundation Seeks Control Of Top-Level Domains: Here’s Why,https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-foundation-control-top-level-domains/,"The Cardano Foundation is preparing to apply for two generic top-level domains—“.ada” and “.cardano”—in the next ICANN application round, positioning the network’s brand and identity closer to the core addressing layer of the web. In a forum announcement dated 21 October 2025, the Foundation said it intends to submit applications in Q1 2026 and will finance the effort entirely from its own resources, not the Cardano Treasury. “The Cardano Foundation plans to apply for the registration of the .ada and .cardano gTLDs,” the post states, adding that the initiative has been scoped since 2023, when ICANN signaled a new application window for gTLDs. Cardano Aims For Its Own Corner Of The Web The move would bring Cardano into a relatively small cohort of blockchain ecosystems that control their own top-level namespace rather than relying solely on third-party registries or Web3-native naming systems. The Foundation frames the applications as both defensive and strategic: securing Cardano-specific string(s) should reduce the risk of brand misuse while creating an on-ramp for identity and interoperability features that bridge Web2 and Web3. If approved, these domains would function like any other gTLD, meaning ecosystem participants could register second-level names such as “vespr.ada” or “nmkr.cardano,” with the registry operated under policies the Foundation says it will publish and report on regularly. Beyond brand control, the Foundation emphasizes potential product-level integrations. It explicitly highlights “simplified wallet addresses,” integration with decentralized identity solutions “like Veridian,” and even “domain tokenisation” as areas it wants to explore. The post also notes active conversations “with Ada Handles and Handshake to explore use cases that bridge traditional DNS and Cardano.” These examples suggest the registry could serve as an anchor for human-readable identifiers that resolve to blockchain credentials, payment endpoints, or verifiable credentials, all within the governance and security constraints of ICANN’s DNS. The Foundation says a multi-disciplinary team has been shaping the plan, including consultations with community experts and vendor evaluations for both the application process and future registry operations. Operationally, it proposes a Community Advisory Group to guide policy and development, and commits to “regularly publishing figures on the gTLDs’ operation,” in line with its existing transparency reports. It also floats the possibility that net returns, if any, could be funneled back into broader ecosystem work. While the post underscores that “there is no guarantee of success,” it argues the risk is justified by the strategic upside and the once-in-a-decade nature of ICANN’s application windows. Financially, the Foundation provides an unusually detailed cost outline. It estimates one-time application costs of roughly $700,000 for the two strings, comprising approximately $500,000 in ICANN fees and $200,000 for application support. It then projects about $350,000 in annual fixed costs to operate the registries, split between ICANN fees and registry software/licensing on one side and marketing/business development/overhead on the other. Variable costs, such as per-domain operations, would depend on sales volume and are expected to be offset by domain revenue. The post reiterates, “The Cardano Foundation will cover all costs directly,” and “will not ask for Cardano Treasury funds .” To surface sentiment and produce a public signal that can be cited in the application dossier, the Foundation has submitted an “Info Action” for community voting. It asks stake pool operators and DReps to support the measure, arguing that visible endorsement can bolster the credibility of a community-based application in ICANN’s review process. “Please cast your vote,” the statement urges, adding that, if the Info Action passes, the Foundation will proceed to file applications for both strings in Q1 2026. As with most governance-adjacent proposals in Cardano, the plan has already prompted debate. In the same forum thread, a community member explained a “no” vote, citing concerns about Foundation governance and the concentration of influence, particularly after the Foundation’s heavy voting in Catalyst Fund 13 . The commenter wrote: “I voted no on this info action,” and argued that the “scale of CF’s voting power… undermined the principles of decentralised governance,” suggesting an independent, community-governed not-for-profit might be a better registrar. While a single post does not constitute a representative sample, it captures the contours of skepticism the Foundation may need to address which were fueled by IOG founder Charles Hoskinson in the past.

Yet, the reality unfolding beneath the surface tells a different story. The convergence of blockchain technology and traditional finance is no longer a theoretical concept. It’s being made possible through standardized messaging frameworks, secure internet protocols, and gateway architectures that bridge both ecosystems. The Foundation of Interoperability: ISO 20022 Alignment At the core of this potential integration lies ISO 20022, the new global financial messaging standard adopted by SWIFT and increasingly supported by blockchain networks like XRPL. This standardized data model allows payment messages from Ripple’s technology stack to be formatted and interpreted seamlessly within SWIFT’s system. Ripple’s network, including RippleNet and the XRPL, is fully compatible with ISO 20022, meaning its message structures, payment instructions, settlement data, and metadata can be natively translated into SWIFT-compliant messages. RIPPLE/XRPL CAN SEAMLESSLY INTEGRATE WITH SWIFT THROUGH STANDARDIZED AND SECURE INTERNET PROTOCOLS Documented 4x. https://t.co/s2nRfB4ZYF pic.twitter.com/BqNVNwFdFw — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) October 23, 2025 This shared standard eliminates one of the main barriers between distributed ledger technology (DLT) and traditional interbank infrastructure: the language of financial messaging. The Role of Secure Internet Protocols and Gateways According to SMQKE, which shared insights about this interoperability on X, Ripple, and the XRPL can integrate with SWIFT through standardized and secure internet protocols. These protocols enable encrypted, authenticated communication between financial institutions and blockchain networks. In practice, gateway services act as intermediaries — translating SWIFT MT/MX messages into XRPL transactions and vice versa. These gateways handle key regulatory requirements such as identity verification, anti-money laundering (AML) checks, and settlement confirmations, ensuring that compliance and auditability are preserved on both sides. Ripple’s use of secure APIs (like REST/JSON frameworks and ISO 20022 wrappers) provides the technical infrastructure for this two-way communication. The result is a system where a payment initiated through SWIFT can settle instantly on XRPL without altering existing banking workflows or compliance systems. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Fintech Connectors: The Practical Integration Path Rather than a direct corporate partnership between Ripple and SWIFT, the integration is being realized through fintech connectors and liquidity providers that operate across both networks. These entities maintain SWIFT connectivity while simultaneously managing XRPL-based settlement rails. Such connectors are already emerging within Ripple’s partner ecosystem. They allow banks to route payments via SWIFT messages while leveraging XRP’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) mechanism for instant cross-border settlement. This hybrid approach maintains the global coverage of SWIFT while integrating the speed and cost-efficiency of blockchain settlements. Why This Matters for Global Finance The implications of this model are transformative. By enabling SWIFT participants to access XRPL settlement channels, financial institutions can drastically reduce transaction costs, settlement delays, and liquidity risks. Moreover, the alignment with ISO 20022 ensures that reconciliation processes remain standardized and interoperable across institutions. This integration represents a future where legacy systems and blockchain technology coexist, not compete. SWIFT retains its role as the trusted global messaging backbone, while Ripple provides the modern liquidity and settlement layer needed for the digital age. In conclusion, the insight shared by SMQKE underscores a crucial evolution in global finance: Ripple’s XRPL doesn’t need to replace SWIFT; it can connect to it. Through ISO 20022 alignment, secure internet protocols, and compliant gateway systems, XRP can become the settlement bridge within SWIFT’s messaging universe. In essence, the “seamless integration” is already technically viable. It’s the logical next step in financial infrastructure, where blockchain speed meets institutional scale.

It was a brutal reality check for investors hoping gold would instantly save them when markets went south. But the crash doesn’t cancel out the bigger reasons people are hoarding gold. History shows that every time stocks tank (say, by 15% or more), gold usually drops first too, and this has happened six times before. But here’s the catch: by the time the S&P hits bottom, gold ends up outperforming stocks by an average of 40 percentage points. Four out of those six times, it even posted positive returns, according to data from Bloomberg. Investors dump gold ETFs as panic hits the market The same Bloomberg data also shows that gold-backed ETFs fell by 0.3% to 98.6 million troy ounces on Wednesday, which was the worst daily drop since May. Retail investors had been throwing money into bullion-backed ETFs, the easiest way for the average Joe to bet on gold without buying bars. Then the sell-off came, and those same people ran. But you see, gold isn’t immune to stress. In a crash, people don’t just sell what they want; they sell what they can. And since gold is a liquid asset, it gets sold too, at least at first. That’s not a bug. That’s basic economics. Unlike retail, central banks aren’t scared of a few red days. In fact, they’re buying more. A recent survey by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum found that nearly a third of 75 central banks plan to increase their gold reserves in the next one to two years. They’re doing it to cut their exposure to US dollar-denominated assets. Makes sense. In a world where fiat money feels shakier, gold looks like the last man standing. Another thing holding up prices is supply. There’s not much of it. And the big holders (central banks again) aren’t likely to flood the market anytime soon. They’re playing the long game, so they never need to sell. So while retail freaks out, central banks just chill. Now, let’s talk about rate hikes. Yeah, they matter. Back in 2022, the S&P fell because people thought Fed tightening would kill earnings. At the same time, gold dropped too—because higher rates make non-yielding assets less attractive. But even then, gold still outperformed stocks by 18 percentage points. That’s not nothing. What matters is what happens after the initial panic. Every time stocks take a beating, investors rotate. They dump risk and pile into safety: longer-term government bonds and, you guessed it, gold. That’s when gold does its job. But to get there, you’ve got to hold through the dip. No panic-selling. No whining.

Aster Coin Struggles but Eyes Potential Rebound Source: tradingview Aster's cryptocurrency price is currently between $0.95 and $1.52, showing recent struggles with significant drops despite a slight six-month gain. The price recently fell over 20% in a week and over 37% in a month. However, there's hope for a rebound with the nearest resistance at $1.84, suggesting a possible rise of around 22% from its high range. If momentum continues, reaching the second resistance level of $2.42 could see a surge of over 59%. With a steady relative strength index and approaching support, Aster shows potential for growth despite past declines. Conclusion Monitoring key levels for HYPE and ASTER is crucial. HYPE has shown potential with its recent activity. ASTER is also worth watching for signs of larger movements. Both coins may offer insights into broader market trends. Keeping an eye on their price action can provide valuable clues. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

We cover 11 different scams and how to identify them in our Support Center. Lately, scammers have found a new angle: impersonating Kraken recruiters and support staff. Their goal? To steal your trust first and your assets second. They’ll promise jobs, partnerships or quick money. They’ll spin stories that sound plausible. They’ll try to make urgency feel like opportunity. But here’s the truth: real employment opportunities can be found through our official Kraken jobs portal and aren’t driven by FOMO. How fake recruiter scams work These bad actors are shapeshifters. They’ll show up as “recruiters” on LinkedIn, email you from lookalike domains, or DM you on Telegram with “exclusive” openings. They’ll even borrow real Kraken employee photos or copy legitimate job postings. Many scams are elaborate. Some will go slowly before to better gain the trust of their victims, a process often referred to as “pig butchering.” We collaborated with the U.S. Secret Service in an operation that recovered $225 million from such fraud. Other scams move fast, trying to use pressure and FOMO to get you to act quickly and without thinking too much. Then comes the ask, often to: Pay “training” or “equipment” fees Provide wallet keys or personal documents Let’s be clear: Kraken will never ask for payment during hiring, ever. Kraken will never ask for your wallet keys , at any point, ever. Think you’ve found a scammer impersonating Kraken? Tell us about it here . How to tell what’s real and what’s risky Use verified @kraken.com email addresses – Scammers have been using real Kraken employee names but from unrelated email addresses – If it’s not from @kraken.com, it’s not Kraken. Appear on LinkedIn as verified Kraken team members – Look for the Kraken Verified badge. Never request sensitive information outside secure portals. Never pressure you into urgent action or payment. If someone doesn’t check all four boxes, stop engaging immediately. What to do if you think you’re being scammed Scammers don’t win because they’re smart. They win because people rush. The best move you can make is the slow one. Here’s how to fight back—with calm, clarity and control. Trust your instincts – If it sounds too good to be true, it is. Guarantees of success don’t exist in real markets, only in scams. Move slowly and be deliberate – Doing nothing is often the smartest move. Scammers weaponize urgency. Take notes, hang up, and contact the company through their official website—not the number or link they gave you. Verify before trusting – Words are cheap. Verification isn’t. Real companies don’t cold-call to fix your “account issue.” Ask for ID, note the employee number and follow up through official lines. Scammers can fake logos and uniforms, but not legitimacy. Understand your emotions – Fear, greed and panic are the scammer’s toolkit. If someone’s message sparks anxiety or excitement, step back. End the call, close the chat and breathe before acting. Remember scammers build trust – Con artists play the long game. They’ll mirror your life, your family, your tone—just to lower your guard. That fake familiarity is manipulation disguised as empathy. Passwords, pins and logins aren’t for sharing – Ever. Not with “recruiters,” “support,” or anyone else. Use a password manager that generates random, unique credentials. One breach shouldn’t mean every account falls. Public profiles are available to scammers too – Everything you post – names, jobs, usernames – feeds their research. Reuse the same handle across platforms? You’ve already given them a roadmap. Lock down what you share. Check website URLs extremely carefully – Fake sites are near-perfect clones, and search engines don’t always protect you. Don’t click. Type the address directly into your browser. If the URL feels “off,” it probably is. Avoid the urge to reply – Even “unsubscribe” tells scammers your email is active. And that “hi” text from an unknown number? That’s not curiosity – it’s bait. Silence is your defense. Take everything you see with a grain of salt – Deepfakes, AI-generated profiles and fabricated news are the new normal. Don’t take screenshots as truth. Verify information across multiple sources before you act – or invest. Our commitment to security At Kraken, security above everything is part of our DNA. We don’t outsource vigilance. We build it, teach it and live it. Productive paranoia is culture . It’s how we protect what matters most – our people, our clients and their crypto. Every time you slow down to verify, you strengthen not just your defenses but the entire Kraken ecosystem. Protect your information. Protect your crypto. Fill out this form to let us know if you think you’ve found a scammer impersonating Kraken. The crypto world rewards curiosity, not carelessness. Share this article. Report scams. Stay alert. And remember — trust must be earned, never assumed. How to get a (legit) job at Kraken Remember, there is only one guaranteed-legit source for legit jobs at Kraken . If you are contacted by a scammer about a role, it may well be about an actual open job listing at Kraken – one of the ways scammers make themselves appear authentic. Don’t fall for it.

Rivian hired just under 15,000 employees as of the end of December 2024. The recent round of layoffs follows Rivian’s announcement last month that it had reduced its workforce by 15%. The layoffs will reportedly focus primarily on commercial positions in the sales and servicing divisions. Rivian redefines strategy as profits remain elusive RIVIAN CUTS 600 JOBS AS EV SECTOR FACES HEADWINDS Rivian will lay off over 600 employees—4% of its workforce—as it trims costs ahead of its R2 SUV launch. The decision comes amid production delays and $5B in losses since 2021. EV demand is cooling, with Q2 sales down 6.3% and GM… pic.twitter.com/OI24ipCCcR — Naeem Aslam (@NaeemAslam23) October 23, 2025 The layoff report by WSJ claimed that Rivian Automotive is facing a declining EV market, high production costs, and fierce rivalry from Tesla, Ford, and an expanding number of Chinese rivals. The report noted that rival companies have made it difficult for the company to maintain steady profits. According to the report, the layoffs show the challenges facing EV makers under U.S. President Donald Trump, whose policies threaten to erode already unstable demand in the U.S. The administration recently eliminated tax credits for EV purchases and has effectively nullified fuel economy and emissions standards, enticing companies to pivot to more profitable gasoline-powered vehicles. In August, Rivian retracted a major financial target, stating that the company would break even on a gross profit basis this year, after previously projecting a tiny profit of about $300 million. Financial data reveals that Rivian Automotive Inc. reported $1.3 billion in revenue for the second quarter, a 12.5% increase over the same period last year. For the same period, a net loss of $1.12 billion was reported, which was a 23.3% improvement over the prior year. Rivian Automotive achieved a 31.9% increase in efficiency over the previous year, despite a net profit margin of -85.7%. Rivian Automotive has focused on increasing the efficiency of its Normal, Illinois, plant’s manufacturing while preparing for its next R2 models, which are expected to expand its market beyond the luxury segment in 2026. AI reshapes jobs as tech giants downsize On October 22, Cryptopolitan covered a story of Meta’s approximately 600 layoffs in its Superintelligence Labs AI company. According to an internal memo, the layoffs will affect teams working on FAIR, product AI, and AI infrastructure. The memo stated that the change is intended to increase the organization’s agility. Meta Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang explained in the memo that the layoffs will offer each employee “more scope and impact” by eliminating too bureaucratic duties from the organization. Meta said that the affected workers can apply for other open positions within the firm and expects most of them to find new internal employment. On October 14, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) opened a new tab informing staff members of possible layoffs and a hiring freeze through the end of the year, as it seeks to utilize artificial intelligence to boost productivity. In a memo, Goldman Sachs referred to the program as “OneGS 3.0” and stated that the sales and client onboarding process, along with other crucial areas, including lending procedures, are among the priorities for its AI initiative. “The rapidly accelerating advancements in AI can unlock significant productivity gains for us, and we are confident we can reinvest those gains to continue delivering world-class solutions for our clients.” – David Solomon , Chief Executive Officer of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. On October 20, SHRM reported that Amazon is preparing to cut up to 15% of its human resources staff in other divisions as it strives to reduce expenses while making significant investments in artificial intelligence. The report stated that People eXperience and Technology, or PXT, a division of Amazon that handles hiring, HR technology, and core HR operations, is expected to be most impacted by the company’s impending round of layoffs. The layoffs are part of Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s efficiency strategy, following at least 27,000 corporate job losses in 2022–2023. Jassy emphasized that workers will be positioned for high-impact roles if they can adapt to AI and contribute to the development of internal AI capabilities. More widespread layoffs are anticipated as AI boosts productivity throughout the organization.

After weeks of declining prices and fading trading volume, the token is still trading below the $2.5 mark, with traders growing increasingly cautious. While some analysts interpret this as a cooling-off period before the next potential expansion phase, fear and uncertainty continue to dominate the market’s short-term outlook. Related Reading: Kadena Shuts Down Operations – Team Confirms Immediate Cease Of All Activities Adding to the tension, top CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn revealed that Chris Larsen, Ripple’s co-founder, has realized over $764 million in profits since January 2018 from XRP-related sales. According to on-chain data, Larsen’s selling activity tends to coincide with local price peaks — a pattern that raises questions about whether current market behavior could signal another turning point. Although such sales are not uncommon among large holders, timing and consistency are key factors that often influence investor sentiment. For many, these moves highlight the delicate balance between long-term strategic profit-taking and the perception of insider confidence in the project’s future. As XRP battles to hold current levels, the market will be closely watching whether institutional players and insiders maintain their exposure — or continue to cash out amid growing volatility. Chris Larsen’s Recurring Profit-Taking and the Fragile State of Altcoins According to analyst Maartunn, Chris Larsen’s latest XRP sale is connected to EvernorthXRP, an entity believed to be one of the wallets managing Ripple-linked holdings and distributions. While this particular transaction might appear routine, Maartunn points out that it fits a recurring pattern — Larsen has consistently realized large profits close to local market highs. Each time XRP experiences a rally, significant selling activity from wallets tied to Ripple executives tends to follow. This recurring behavior fuels debate around insider timing and investor sentiment. While such moves can be interpreted as simple portfolio rebalancing, they often occur when retail enthusiasm peaks, amplifying uncertainty during already fragile market conditions. The timing of Larsen’s sales — amid a broader altcoin correction — has intensified speculation that large holders are preparing for extended market weakness. The current environment for altcoins remains particularly delicate. Many tokens are sitting near long-term support zones, trading well below their 200-day moving averages. Historically, altcoins have only regained strong bullish momentum after Bitcoin has convincingly broken above its all-time high (ATH). Without this confirmation from BTC, capital tends to stay conservative, favoring liquidity and safety over speculation. In essence, Larsen’s consistent profit-taking and the wider altcoin stagnation highlight the market’s transitional phase. Until Bitcoin reasserts dominance through a clean breakout, most altcoins — including XRP — are likely to face muted inflows and persistent volatility. Investors are now watching whether Bitcoin’s next major move will reignite confidence across the crypto landscape or confirm that the current rally was just another temporary bounce in an uncertain cycle. Related Reading: Bitcoin Trapped On Binance: The Battle Between $107K and $119K Heats Up XRP Price Analysis: Testing Support as Momentum Fades XRP continues to trade under pressure, consolidating around the $2.40 zone after failing to reclaim its short-term moving averages. The 3-day chart shows the token struggling below both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages, signaling persistent bearish momentum. The recent rejection near the $2.60–$2.70 area aligns with a key resistance cluster that has consistently capped upside attempts since early October. Despite the current weakness, XRP has managed to hold above the 200-day moving average, which currently sits near $2.00 — a level that has historically acted as strong dynamic support. If this level fails, the next downside target could lie around $1.80–$1.90, where the previous accumulation zone formed earlier this year. On the upside, bulls would need to push the price decisively above $2.70 to regain control and confirm a short-term trend reversal. Such a move would likely attract fresh liquidity and shift sentiment toward recovery.

There Are More XRP Treasury Companies Than You Think,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-about-to-overtake-ethereum/,"Ripple is currently on the heels of Ethereum as more XRP treasury companies emerge. This follows Evernorth’s announcement that it plans to raise over $1 billion, which it will use to buy XRP as its primary reserve asset. 11 XRP Treasury Companies Now In Existence Crypto researcher BD revealed in an X post that there are currently 11 XRP treasury companies. Evernorth is on course to be the largest public XRP holder with its proposed $1 billion raise. The company is backed by Ripple, which contributed some of its XRP holdings to establish the treasury. Meanwhile, BD mentioned the other XRP treasury companies and how many coins they hold or plan to buy. Trident is the second-largest XRP treasury company, with $500 million in assets. Webus’s treasury is worth $300 million, while VivoPower has purchased $121 million of XRP and plans to stake some of them in Flare for yield. Wellgistics has the fifth-largest XRP treasury, having deployed $50 million to purchase XRP, while Hyperscale has $10 million in XRP reserves. Everything Blockchain also deployed $10 million for its XRP treasury and plans to stake it in Flare for yields. Japanese company Gumi has also revealed plans to deploy $17 million to buy, with these purchases expected to take place between now and February next year. Gumi also recently revealed that it is investing $5 million in Evernorth’s PIPE, contributing to the Ripple-backed company’s proposed $1 billion raise. Notably, the company ranks sixth among XRP treasury companies by the amount it plans to deploy to buy XRP. Worksport, BC Bud, and Digital Comm are the remaining XRP treasury companies, holding $5 million, $250,000, and $225,000, respectively. Ripple Still Behind Ethereum In Terms Of XRP Treasury Companies Despite Ripple’s efforts, it is worth mentioning that the number of XRP treasury companies is still below the number of Ethereum treasury companies. Strategic ETH Reserve data shows that there are currently 69 ETH treasury companies, way ahead of the 11 XRP treasury companies that currently exist. These Ethereum treasury companies hold a combined total of $22.99 billion in ETH, which represents almost 5% of the altcoin’s total supply. Meanwhile, the XRP treasury companies BD listed hold just about $2 billion in XRP, including Evernorth, which has declared its intention to purchase XRP. Regardless, this marks a positive for XRP, as these treasury companies could trigger a supply shock for the altcoin as they accumulate more coins. Other XRP treasury companies are also expected to emerge, which could spark a significant rally for the XRP price . At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $2.39, down in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Ripple|Altcoin|BC Bud|BD|Digital Comm|Ethereum treasury|Evernorth’s PIPE|Gumi|Hyperscale|ripple|Strategic Ethereum Reserve|VivoPower|Wellgistics|Worksport|XRP|XRP news|XRP price|XRP Treasury|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ETH|REGULATION|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 19:00:53

What began as a formal policy address has become a viral moment, thanks to X user Levi Rietveld, who shared a key clip highlighting the Fed’s evolving stance on digital assets and blockchain technology. The clip’s message was unmistakable: the United States’ top monetary authority is now publicly exploring the integration of tokenization and distributed ledger technology into the future of payments. Levi Rietveld’s Post Sends Ripples Through the XRP Community Levi Rietveld’s post triggered a surge of interest and debate online. The video features the Federal Reserve Governor acknowledging that digital assets are no longer peripheral to the financial system. In his exact words: “This is an acknowledgement that distributed ledgers and crypto assets are no longer on the fringes, but are increasingly woven into the fabric of a payment and financial system.” Fed Governor Drops #XRP Bombshell pic.twitter.com/aQA60u1yR9 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 22, 2025 For XRP supporters, who have long argued that Ripple’s blockchain is uniquely positioned for institutional integration , this statement resonated deeply. The governor went further, emphasizing the Fed’s dual role in both supporting innovation and ensuring systemic stability. The Fed’s Vision: Tokenization, Smart Contracts, and AI in Payments The Fed governor outlined a proactive approach toward understanding and potentially leveraging blockchain-based technologies. He explained: “Before we hear from these innovators, I would like to touch on the roles that the Federal Reserve plays to support the private sector. These include serving as a convener to solve coordination problems and operating the core payment settlement infrastructure. We are also looking ahead, conducting hands-on research on tokenization using smart contracts and the intersection of AI and payments for use in our own payment systems.” We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He added that these initiatives aim “to understand the innovation happening within the payment system” and “to evaluate whether these technologies could provide opportunities to upgrade our own payment infrastructures and enable us to have deeper conversations with the industry on these new technologies.” This candid acknowledgment is one of the clearest signs yet that the Federal Reserve is not merely observing digital asset innovation from the sidelines; it is testing and evaluating its potential applicability to the U.S. financial infrastructure. Implications for XRP and the Broader Crypto Market The implications of the governor’s statement are significant. For XRP holders and Ripple advocates, the idea of the Fed researching tokenization and smart contracts fuels speculation that the institution could eventually integrate such technologies into settlement systems — a space where Ripple has long offered enterprise-grade solutions. Levi Rietveld’s post amplified that optimism, with the XRP community interpreting the speech as tacit validation of Ripple’s long-term vision. The timing also aligns with growing institutional exploration of real-world asset tokenization, where Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin and XRP Ledger technologies could play critical roles. A Historic Turning Point or Just an Opening Chapter? While the remarks don’t name XRP or Ripple directly, they signify a crucial turning point in central bank discourse. For the first time, the Federal Reserve is publicly addressing blockchain technologies as tools that may “upgrade” payment systems rather than disrupt them. Still, experts caution that acknowledgement doesn’t equate to adoption. The Fed’s “hands-on research” is an exploratory step, not an operational integration. Nevertheless, for the XRP Army long awaiting institutional validation, this is a watershed moment that confirms what many have believed for years: distributed ledgers are no longer the future; they are becoming the fabric of finance itself.

In today’s market, this is possible through blockchain-themed funds, Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), diversified crypto baskets, or unit trusts. In this guide, we’ll focus on how to invest in crypto ETFs in the USA, the benefits, risks, tax implications, and future prospects. What Is a Crypto ETF? Definition of Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a basket of assets that holds a collection of stocks, commodities, or bonds, which trade on stock exchanges such as the NYSE or NASDAQ, just like individual stocks. ETFs pool money from investors to purchase multiple underlying assets, including crypto-related ones. So, when you buy into an ETF, you get to own a portion of the investment basket without having to purchase the assets it holds individually. How Crypto ETFs Differ from Traditional ETFs By design, ETFs are structured to hold and track the performance of an underlying asset, index, or basket of assets. A Traditional ETF is a regulated investment vehicle that tracks the performance of conventional stocks, bonds, and commodities. Examples include: Stock Equity ETFs: S&P 500, Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF. Bond ETFs: iShares U.S. Treasury Bond ETF, Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund ETF. Commodity ETFs: iShares Silver Trust (SLV), Invesco DB Oil Fund (DBO). Sector-based ETFs: Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ). A crypto ETF allows investors to gain exposure to the performance of crypto assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, or XRP through familiar, regulated investment channels, without actually buying any crypto. Simply said, the key difference between a traditional ETF and a crypto ETF lies in what they hold and track. Why Crypto ETFs Appeal to Investors Easy Access: Much like regular stocks, crypto ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges in the U.S. This is ideal for investors who are already familiar with the stock market and looking to enter the crypto space. No Complex Setup: Crypto ETFs are held in brokerage accounts just like stocks. No need to manage private/public keys, set up crypto wallets, or navigate exchanges. Regulation: Unlike direct cryptocurrency investments, crypto ETFs benefit from established regulatory frameworks, which provide greater transparency and protection for investors. However, the underlying assets remain subject to evolving regulations. Diversification: When you buy Bitcoin, your risk is directly related to the performance of the coin. Some ETFs hold more than one crypto-related asset, which spreads the risk. If one asset in the basket loses steam, others might be in the green, balancing out the portfolio. Secure and Professionally Managed: Crypto ETFs are managed by professionals, so investors don’t need to track market trends or rebalance portfolios themselves. They also offer built-in security and institutional-grade custody, protecting assets from risks like hacks or lost passwords. Types of Crypto ETFs Spot Crypto ETFs – Directly Hold Underlying Assets Spot crypto ETFs directly hold cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, offering the most direct form of exposure to crypto through an ETF. The value of a spot ETF moves in sync with the real-time price of the underlying asset, although with minimal deviation. Examples include BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), one of the largest spot Bitcoin ETFs that holds actual Bitcoin; VanEck Ethereum ETF (ETHV), which provides exposure to Ethereum; and REX-Osprey SOL + Staking ETF (SSK) for Solana. Futures-Based ETFs – Track Derivatives Future-Based ETFs don’t hold actual crypto assets. Instead, the fund invests in derivatives, mainly futures contracts traded on regulated exchanges like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). *A futures contract is a time-limited financial agreement that bets on where prices will go on a future date. Simply said, futures contracts allow Futures-Based ETFs to speculate on the future price of assets such as Bitcoin without directly owning the coin. A notable example is the ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), the first Bitcoin futures ETF approved in the U.S. Equity-Based ETFs – Invest in Crypto Companies or Miners Equity-Based ETFs don’t hold digital assets but rather invest in publicly traded companies involved in the crypto ecosystem, such as crypto payment processors, mining firms, blockchain technology developers or crypto exchanges. The value of these ETFs is therefore tied to the profitability and growth of the underlying company, which are themselves influenced by crypto market conditions. For example, Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) is an Equity-Based ETF that invests at least 80% of its net assets in companies involved in blockchain, such as MicroStrategy, Coinbase, and Cipher Mining Inc. Benefits of Investing in Crypto ETFs Regulated Market Access Since crypto ETFs trade on established stock exchanges, they are subject to the oversight of financial regulators, such as the U.S. SEC and the CFTC. This means that they must adhere to institutional-grade security standards, disclosure requirements, and investor protection obligations. For many investors, the regulatory framework around crypto ETFs provides assurance and legitimacy. Simplified Exposure Without Wallets or Private Keys Simplified exposure is one of the biggest reasons investors are attracted to crypto ETFs. You need not worry about lost key phrases, private or public keys, or understand how blockchain wallets work. The ETF handles the technical side of things, and all you have to do is buy and sell shares via your brokerage account. Diversification Across Assets or Companies With multi-asset crypto ETFs, investors enjoy a diversified asset base that might be difficult to achieve if they were to purchase each individual asset in the investment vehicle separately. The idea is to mitigate the risks associated with extreme market volatility that comes with holding a singular asset. Similarly, Equity-Based ETFs spread risk across multiple blockchain-based businesses. For example, if an ETF holds both Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and SOL, a decline in one or two may be offset by gains in the others. Liquidity and Transparency Unlike some direct crypto investments, where liquidity varies across exchanges and pricing can be opaque, crypto ETFs trade with transparent pricing and established liquidity on regulated exchanges. Investors can buy or sell a position quickly during market hours, just like they would with stocks. Additionally, holdings are regularly disclosed (often on a daily basis), ensuring that you are always aware of the assets under management (AUM). Risks of Crypto ETFs Price Volatility in Underlying Assets Despite the regulated structure of crypto ETFs, price risks exist, which is the volatility of the cryptocurrencies themselves. If Bitcoin and Ethereum enter a bear phase, losing 30% of their value, the ETF tracking the performance of these underlying assets declines in a similar manner. Management Fees and Tracking Errors All ETFs charge investors a management fee, known as an expense ratio, which is expressed as a percentage of the investment amount. The fee amount depends on the type of ETF (equity-based, actively managed, or passively managed). Actively managed crypto ETFs are known to have higher expense ratios compared to traditional ETFs, which can, over time, negatively impact your returns. There is also a risk of tracking errors that compound over time. Crypto ETFs may not always perfectly follow the price movements of the underlying asset, resulting in portfolio underperformance relative to directly owning the cryptocurrency. Futures Roll Costs (for Derivative ETFs) Futures-based crypto ETFs use time-limited futures contracts rather than holding actual cryptocurrencies. In simple terms, they bet on the future price of an asset, without owning the asset. Since these contracts are timed, they can expire. Before expiry, the ETF must “ roll ” the contracts, i.e., sell the old ones and purchase new ones. Sometimes, the market enters a “ contango, ” a scenario where futures contracts cost more than the current spot price of the underlying asset. Who pays the difference? The ETF pays extra every time it rolls its contracts. This extra cost trickles down to investors and slowly reduces overall returns. Suppose a Bitcoin Futures ETF holds contracts for Bitcoin when the spot price is $60,000, and the contracts are about to expire. To keep its position and stay invested, the fund must replace the expiring contracts with new ones for the next period. Unfortunately, the futures contracts now cost $61,000 per BTC, which means the ETF has to pay $1,000 more (roll cost). If futures prices remain higher than spot prices (persistent contango), the extra cost slowly eats into the ETF’s overall returns and, in turn, investors take a hit too. Regulatory and Market Uncertainty Crypto laws around the world continue to evolve, creating ongoing regulatory uncertainty. Because crypto ETFs are linked to the broader cryptocurrency market, unfavourable policies, new regulations, or legal rulings in the crypto space can significantly impact their performance. In addition, technological challenges and potential competition from central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) add another layer of uncertainty for investors, making it difficult to predict the future market direction of crypto ETFs and the broader crypto market. How to Invest in a Crypto ETF (Step-by-Step Guide) Research Available Crypto ETFs Before investing in crypto ETFs, it is essential to understand what each one offers. Is it a single-asset crypto ETF focused solely on Bitcoin, Solana, or Ethereum? Or a diversified ETF with multiple cryptocurrencies? Perhaps the fund only invests in companies that utilize blockchain technology . Ensure that you understand the crypto assets held by the ETFs, their investment strategy, and historical performance. Consult independent analysis and read the prospectus of the fund to understand what you’re getting into. Here are some useful research tools: The Block – Live data and fund flows for Bitcoin and other crypto ETFs. VettaFi ETFdb – ETF screeners with historical returns, AUM, and strategy details. Coinglass – Real-time inflows and outflows of major crypto ETFs. SoSoValue – ETF analytics, holdings data, and institutional activity tracking. U.S SEC EDGAR Database – Provides access to official ETF filings, including prospectuses and disclosures. The official website of the funds – Always verify the latest holdings, NAV, and regulatory filings directly from the source. Check the ETF’s Structure and Holdings Determine the structure of the ETF. Is it spot, futures, or equity-based? This allows you to understand their performance characteristics. Also, know their holdings and historical tracking error ( Spot crypto ETFs: Verify the actual cryptocurrencies included in the fund. Futures-based crypto ETFs: Check the type of contracts expiration strategy at play, as this informs the rolling schedule. Is it front-month contracts (monthly expiration), near-term contracts (1-3 months), or longer-dated contracts (6+ months)? ETFs that frequently roll front-month contracts may incur higher roll costs during “ contango ,” resulting in underperformance relative to spot prices. Equity-based crypto ETFs: Examine which blockchain companies are in the investment basket and their relevance to crypto markets. Analyze Expense Ratios and Liquidity The expense ratio is the annual fee a crypto ETF charges investors to cover its operating expenses, which include marketing, management, legal, record-keeping, custodial services, and distribution fees, among others. It is typically expressed as a percentage of the investment amount and automatically deducted from your returns. If you invest $5,000 in a fund with an expense ratio of 1%, you’ll pay $50 per year. Why is the expense ratio important? The lower the expense ratio, the higher your net returns. Crypto ETF expense ratios vary widely. For instance, spot crypto ETFs typically charge 0.2%-0.95%, with most competitive options at 0.20%-0.30%. Grayscale’s GBTC, however, charges 1.50%. Futures-based crypto ETFs generally range from 0.33% to 2.5%. Compare expense ratios across similar ETFs to find the most cost-effective options. Liquidity is equally important. Check the ETF’s bid/ask spread, average daily trading volume, and total assets under management (AUM). Higher volumes, tighter spreads, and large AUM mean easier trading and better liquidity. *Bid/Ask spread: The difference between buying and selling prices. Choose a Regulated Brokerage Platform Next up, look for a brokerage in the U.S. that offers the crypto ETFs you want to buy. Major platforms include Interactive Brokers, Fidelity, Robinhood, Charles Schwab, and E*TRADE. Ensure that the broker is properly regulated (look for SEC and FINRA registration) and offers the type of account you need. Decide Investment Amount and Allocation Before investing in that crypto ETF, consider these questions: How much of your portfolio do you want to allocate towards crypto ETFs? What is your investment timeline, and what are your financial goals? Experts suggest an allocation of 1-5% for conservative investors, 5-10% for moderate investors, and about 10-15% for those with a much higher risk tolerance. Make your own decision, but remember to invest only what you can afford to lose. Place the Buy Order Like a Stock Once you’ve chosen a crypto ETF, log into your brokerage account, search its ticker (e.g., IBIT for iShares Bitcoin Trust), and enter how many shares you want. Use a market order to buy instantly or a limit order to set your maximum price, then review and confirm your purchase. Monitor ETF Performance Regularly Review the performance of your holdings at least monthly or quarterly, and rebalance when your allocation shifts significantly from your target. For instance, if your crypto allocation increases to 20% and your target was 8%, consider selling the excess to redistribute and lock in profits. Here are two scenarios that depict rebalancing: Stage Stocks Bonds Crypto ETF Cash Withdrawn Total Portfolio Stock % Bond % Crypto % Starting Portfolio $70,000 $22,000 $8,000 $0 $100,000 70% 22% 8% After Market Change $77,000 $22,660 $20,000 $0 $119,660 64.40% 18.90% 16.70% SCENARIO 1: TAKING PROFIT Rebalancing Actions Sell $631 Buy $1,342 Sell $11,273 $10,562 – – – – After Rebalancing $76,369 $24,002 $8,727 $10,562 $109,098 70% 22% 8% Best For: Need cash or reducing risk SCENARIO 2: REDISTRIBUTING Rebalancing Actions Buy $6,777 Buy $3,785 Sell $10,562 $0 – – – – After Rebalancing $83,777 $26,445 $9,438 $0 $119,660 70% 22% 8% Best For: Long-term growth Also, keep abreast of major developments such as: Changes in the ETF’s structure or strategy Significant shifts in the underlying assets Regulatory updates impacting crypto ETFs Expense ratio adjustment by the fund Major crypto market news Finally, most brokerages likely have price alerts and tracking tools; use them to monitor the performance of your portfolio. However, do not become obsessed with checking prices daily. Where to Buy Crypto ETFs in the USA Traditional Brokerage Accounts You can buy crypto ETFs from U.S. brokerages like: Fidelity: Spot Bitcoin ETFs (IBIT, FBTC, HODL) and blockchain funds. Charles Schwab: Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, crypto futures, and blockchain stocks. E*TRADE: Crypto ETFs and trusts on U.S. exchanges. Interactive Brokers (IBKR): Spot Bitcoin/Ethereum ETFs (U.S.), and Bitcoin/Ether futures. Note that these platforms offer different kinds of accounts, including taxable brokerage and IRA (retirement) accounts. Crypto-Friendly Platforms Robinhood: If you already use Robinhood for stock or crypto trading, you might just want to keep everything in one place. The platform also offers spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to investors in the U.S., with low minimum investments and commission-free trading. eToro: eToro is a multi-asset investment platform that lets investors trade directly in cryptocurrencies and crypto ETFs, including spot Bitcoin ETFs. It offers fractional investing and boasts over 1 million accounts. Robo-Advisors: Automated platforms like Wealthfront and Betterment offer spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs to U.S investors. Sofi additionally also offers indirect crypto exposure via thematic ETF portfolios focused on blockchain companies. *A robo-advisor is an automated investment platform that automatically invests your money and manages your portfolio based on your goals and risk level. Global Access — Availability by Country United States: Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs approved and trading since January 2024. Canada: First approved spot Bitcoin ETF (Purpose Bitcoin ETF, BTCC) in February 2021, and has since expanded to include Ethereum and Solana ETFs. Europe: The EU does not permit single-asset crypto ETFs under UCITS diversification guidelines. Instead, investors access similar funds via physically-backed ETPs (Exchange-Traded Products) or ETNs. Hong Kong: Approved spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs in April 2024, becoming the first major Asian hub to do so. Australia: Approved its first spot Bitcoin ETFs in June 2024, with VanEck and Monochrome products now trading on ASX and Cboe Australia. China (Mainland): Remains restrictive with no domestically-approved ETFs and intensified enforcement of crypto bans as of 2025. Singapore and India: No domestically-approved ETFs in either country. However, Singaporeans can access spot Bitcoin ETFs listed overseas through licensed brokers. Investors in India can also buy into U.S. Bitcoin ETFs under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (up to $250,000 per year). Always verify that a specific crypto ETF is available and compliant with U.S. regulations before attempting to invest. Top Crypto ETFs to Watch in 2025 Spot Bitcoin ETFs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT): This spot crypto ETF is issued by BlackRock and has become one of the most liquid (average daily volume of 48.6M shares) and fastest-growing ETFs. IBIT leads the market with about $90 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of October 2025, and a competitive expense ratio of 0.25%. It also posted a one-year return of 79.48% in October 2025. Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC): Backed by Fidelity Investments, FBTC is IBIT’s biggest competitor, currently with an AUM of $23 billion. The fund features unique in-house custody, rather than third-party custodians like most competitors. FBTC has demonstrated strong momentum in recent times, leading Bitcoin ETF inflows with $132.67 million on October 13, 2025. Like IBIT, it features a low expense ratio of 0.25%. ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB): ARKB holds over $5.6 billion in AUM and combines the expertise of ARK Invest and 21Shares. The fund currently charges an expense ratio of 0.21%, with its underlying assets held in cold storage custody by one of the largest crypto custodians. ARKB delivered a strong 79.54% one-year return as of October 2025, making it worth watching in the rest of 2025. Others include Grayscale’s GBTC (1.5% expense ratio), Bitwise’s BITB, and VanEck’s HODL. Why watch spot Bitcoin ETFs in 2025 : Bitcoin hit a new all-time high of $126k on October 6, 2025, and market analysts expect the coin to reach $150k to $200k by year-end, driven by strong ETF inflows, institutional demand, and favourable macroeconomic conditions. If this happens, the share prices of spot Bitcoin ETFs would rise proportionally, in line with Bitcoin’s gains. Spot Ethereum ETFs iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA): ETHA is managed by BlackRock. As of October 2025, it carries an expense ratio of 0.25%, an AUM of over $16 billion, and a one-year return of 59.2%. Fidelity Ethereum Fund (FETH): Managed by Fidelity, FETH offers a low-cost entry point with an expense ratio of 0.25%. Its AUM as of October 2025 is over $3 billion, with a one-year return of 59.16%. Others include Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH), Bitwise’s ETHW, and VanEck’s ETHV. Diversified Blockchain ETFs For investors who prefer not to invest in single-asset funds or ETFs with direct crypto correlation, diversified blockchain ETFs offer a viable alternative. Diversified blockchain ETFs hold a wide range of assets, including stocks of blockchain-related companies, providing investors with indirect exposure to cryptocurrencies. For instance, the Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF (BLOK) invests in firms such as Coinbase, Robinhood, and CleanSpark, alongside mining companies like Cipher Mining. Meanwhile, the Global X Blockchain ETF (BKCH) holds Marathon Digital, Riot Platforms, and TeraWulf, firms that benefit from crypto adoption and blockchain innovation . Why is it worth it? You enjoy lower volatility compared to holding cryptocurrencies themselves. Tax Implications of Investing in Crypto ETFs Capital Gains Tax Treatment Crypto ETFs are taxed in the same manner as stocks. Compared to direct crypto taxation, they are much easier to report and also offer some advantages. You owe capital gains tax only when you sell your shares for a profit. The rate charged to you will depend on the volume sold, the custody time, and whether it was a spot or futures crypto ETF. In the U.S., if you held your spot crypto ETF shares for 1 year or less before selling them, that falls into the short-term capital gains bracket. The sale event will be taxed at the ordinary income rate (10% – 37%). If the custody period is more than 1 year before the sale, you’ll fall into the long-term capital gains tax rates, which are 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on your income bracket. The takeaway is that holding your share of spot ETFs for more than a year qualifies for lower, preferential capital-gains rates. Reporting ETF Holdings in Tax Returns Just like stocks or mutual funds, your brokerage will provide you with a Form 1099-B every year to fill out all crypto ETF sales and proceeds. The details on the Form 1099-B are then reported on Form 8949 and Schedule D of your tax return filing. Spot vs Futures ETF Tax Differences For futures-based crypto ETFs, the tax rules are different. In this case, the long-term capital gains tax rates will apply to 60% of your capital gain, while the short-term capital gains tax rate applies to the remaining 40%, regardless of custody time, unlike spot crypto ETFs. Let’s say you made $10,000 profit on a Bitcoin futures ETF: 60% ($6,000) is taxed at the lower long-term rate. 40% ($4,000) is taxed at your regular income rate. The 60/40 rule can help short-term investors reduce their tax bill, but long-term investors pay slightly more than if they held a spot crypto ETF. It is important to note that the IRS applies the mark-to-market principle to future-based ETFs. This means that your fund is assumed to have been sold at the close of each tax year. If you did not sell, then you may owe taxes on unrealized gains. Additionally, future ETFs are subject to the wash sales rule , i.e., if you made a loss on a sale event and initiated a buy-back within 30 days, you cannot claim that loss on your tax returns. Are Crypto ETFs Right for You? For Conservative Investors Seeking Regulated Exposure If you want to participate in the growth of crypto assets within a transparent and regulated framework, investing in crypto ETFs is right for you. Crypto ETFs trade on conventional exchanges, just like stocks. If you are already familiar with navigating traditional exchanges, then you are good to go. They are also overseen by financial regulators and utilize institutional asset custodians to safeguard holdings, providing more protection than direct crypto ownership. For Beginners Avoiding Private Key Management Crypto investing for beginners can be a hassle. Beginners face challenges such as understanding the nature of transactions, picking out the best wallet, setting up seed phrases, and managing private keys. With crypto ETFs, you don’t need a private key or any of those technical requirements; you can trade directly from your brokerage account. This simplicity eliminates the risk of losses due to wallet security issues. In 2024 alone, over $2.2 billion in crypto was lost due to hacks, wallet vulnerabilities, and compromised private keys. If you want to cut out all the technical jargon while still gaining exposure to major cryptos like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Solana, in a more secure environment, crypto ETFs are right for you. For Diversified Portfolios Balancing Risk and Growth Looking for a balanced portfolio strategy? Diversified crypto ETF portfolios offer a basket of assets containing a variety of cryptocurrencies or stocks of blockchain-related companies. This diversity helps balance risk and growth. The value depletion experienced by a fund tracking only Bitcoin during a bear market will be significant when compared to another fund tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum (assuming Ether was bullish during the same period). Diversification can help stabilize returns, but because most cryptocurrencies tend to move in the same direction, the benefits are often smaller than in traditional markets. The Future of Crypto ETFs Expanding to Multi-Asset Crypto Index Funds While multi-asset crypto index funds already exist, they remain limited in scope, tracking only the largest and most popular coins using simple market-cap weighting. In reality, there are hundreds of cryptocurrency assets across various market segments. In the coming years, as regulatory frameworks mature, crypto index funds are expected to expand coverage into DeFi governance tokens , layer 2 tokens, stablecoins, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Weighting methodologies will likely evolve from basic market-cap models to data-driven indexes, incorporating network activity, trading volumes, liquidity, and on-chain fundamentals. Just as the S&P 500 provides investors with broad exposure to equities, the next-generation crypto index will offer investors exposure to the growth of the entire crypto ecosystem through comprehensive and resilient investment vehicles. Global Regulatory Approvals Currently, the U.S. leads in terms of regulatory approvals for crypto ETFs, with several filings beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum (Solana, XRP, Litecoin) undergoing review at the SEC. Other major markets, such as Asia, the European Union, and Australia, are also moving towards clearer frameworks to support crypto ETFs. However, progress is still uneven. Many countries still lack clear rules for pricing, auditing, or safeguarding digital assets held within ETFs, making cross-border listings and investor confidence difficult. Likewise, differing definitions of what qualifies as a “crypto security” continue to fuel uncertainty and inhibit global participation. Aligning regulations on custody, disclosure, and valuation would allow crypto ETFs to trade seamlessly across jurisdictions, reduce compliance friction, and attract deeper institutional capital. This could eventually lead to a more transparent, liquid, and globally connected crypto ETF market. Institutional Adoption Driving Liquidity Perhaps the most significant future development will be growing institutional adoption. Major pension funds, endowments, and corporate treasuries are beginning to view crypto ETFs as acceptable vehicles for digital asset exposure. As more institutional money flows into these products, liquidity will improve, expense ratios may decrease through competition, and the overall crypto market could experience reduced volatility.",Cryptocurrency Guides|Bitcoin|Charles Schwab.|E*Trade|Ethereum|Robinhood,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-23 19:25:46

The CEOs also met with GOP lawmakers, but responses varied. Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) opined that rushing the bill would trigger backlash and reversals under future administrations. “The worst thing we can do … is try to ram it through,” he said. He warned that moving too fast would produce policy “designed by a heroin addict with a socket wrench.” Crypto CEOs Claim Progress Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, however, told CNBC the talks were “very productive,” calling recent bipartisan meetings a rare positive sign. “There’s strong bipartisan support to get this market structure legislation done. It’s important for America and for the 15 million Americans involved in crypto.” DC may be shut down, but momentum for market structure clarity is at an all-time high.

Leaders, including Senators Catherine Cortez Masto, Mark Warner, and Gallego, confronted industry figures about Twitter reactions and leaks, demanding genuine accountability. Sen. Cory Booker reportedly pushed the CEOs to support bipartisan appointments to the SEC and CFTC , a contentious issue given recent executive actions to undermine agency independence.

Our Bitcoin price prediction expects BTC’s price to reach $160K by the end of 2025 due to the bullish sentiment following the halving event. By 2031, BTC might touch $350,548 following increased institutional adoption. Since the beginning of 2024, Bitcoin’s price has doubled, but it has seen a notable 45% increase in just the two weeks following the presidential election. This boost has solidified Bitcoin’s role in the so-called “Trump trade,” with the president-elect’s positive stance on the cryptocurrency industry fueling investor optimism about this emerging asset class. As Bitcoin’s on-chain activities surge, questions arise, such as: “Does Bitcoin have the potential to hold above the $100K mark?” or “Will Bitcoin go up?” or “Where will Bitcoin be in 5 years?” Let’s answer them using our Bitcoin price prediction. Overview Cryptocurrency Bitcoin Ticker BTC Price $110,825 (+2%) Market capitalization $2.11 Trillion Trading volume (24-hour) $42.13 Billion (+18.9%) Circulating supply 19.87 Million BTC All-time high $124,457; August 14, 2025 All-time low $0.04865; Jul 15, 2010 24-hour high $111,295 24-hour low $108,796 Bitcoin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Current Price $110,825 Price Prediction $ 109,610 (-0.9%) Fear & Greed Index 49 (Neutral) Sentiment Bullish Volatility 2.16% Green Days 16/30 (53%) 50-Day SMA $114,624 200-Day SMA $105,533 Bitcoin price analysis TL;DR Breakdown: BTC price analysis shows that Bitcoin surges toward $110K Resistance for BTC is at $112,031 Support for BTC/USD is at $108,813 The BTC price analysis for 23 October confirms that BTC faces a surge in bullish volatility as the price moves above $110K.

The hourly price chart confirms that Bitcoin is attempting to drop below the immediate support line; however, bulls are eyeing a recovery rally in the coming hours. If BTC’s price holds momentum above $112,031, it will fuel a bullish rally to $115,734. BTCUSD Chart by TradingView If bulls fail to initiate a surge, the BTC price may drop below the immediate support line at $108,813, beginning a bearish trend to $106,839. Is Bitcoin a good investment? The rising institutional demand for Bitcoin etfs makes it a good investment option in the crypto market. However, Bitcoin has a short investment history filled with very volatile market value. Whether it is a good investment depends on your financial profile, investment portfolio, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is suggested to conduct investment advice of the financial markets and understand the financial system risks. Why is Bitcoin up today? Bitcoin faced a surge in selling demand as buyers failed to push the price above Fib levels. However, the recent accumulation pushed the price to new weekly highs. Will the BTC price reach $100K? Bitcoin price broke its much-anticipated mark of $100K, aiming for a new ATH. The price currently prepares to maintain its buying demand above $120K. Will BTC reach $1 million? $1 million is a significant milestone for the BTC price. However, it is achievable if Bitcoin continues to attract institutional interest in the coming years. Is Bitcoin a good long-term investment? As several institutions continue to accumulate BTC and Bitcoin faces a rise in global recognition, Bitcoin has a solid long-term future. Recent news/opinions on BTC As reported by Cryptopolitan , Bitcoin ETFs have maintained a lead over Ethereum ETFs in terms of capital inflows. This has pushed Bitcoin’s dominance to 59% over Ethereum’s 12%.. Bitcoin price prediction October 2025 Bitcoin’s price jumped to $118,000, making a minor recovery in September. However, it declined later and saw heavy accumulation, which could mean we’ll see a peak around October 2025. Bitcoin’s price might attempt to maintain an average price of $111,000 and be pushed further, at least $118,000 if strong downward pressures are not seen. However, we might see a rejection on the bearish side, leading to a consolidation at around $105,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction October 2025 $105,000 $111,000 $118,000 Bitcoin price prediction 2025 Historically, Bitcoin has been a significant crypto coin in the year following a halving, and it is expected to push up its price. Bitcoin miners might play a crucial role in holding bullish sentiment for future price movements. Spot Bitcoin ETFs are projected to be a key driver of Bitcoin prices and the broader cryptocurrency market in 2025. As a result, Bitcoin’s trajectory might follow a bullish trend ahead with rising treasury term premium. Furthermore, there is an increasing bullish sentiment that the base interest rates could be cut in the US, and thus, help to further the upward movement of Bitcoin . An outcome of which the 2025 year could be positive for Bitcoin, with its crypto-price perhaps touching $160,000 at the highest and the low could be around $68,000. Bitcoin Price Prediction Potential Low Potential Average Potential High Bitcoin Price Prediction 2025 $68,000 $120,000 $160,000 Bitcoin Price Predictions 2026-2031 Year Minimum Price Average Price Maximum Price 2026 $115,000 $130,000 $185,000 2027 $140,491 $170,100 $216,738 2028 $164,063 $185,068 $244,142 2029 $195,629 $200,312 $255,321 2030 $225,903 $248,568 $270,593 2031 $285,058 $303,555 $350,548 Bitcoin price prediction 2026 Bitcoin might witness slow growth after 2025’s halving surge, resulting in a surge in selling pressure. However, more financial products including a surge in ETF flows might hold BTC prices within a bullish region. The digital assets market sentiment shows bullish signals for Bitcoin hit new highs. As the overall sentiment gives a bullish outlook, one should research more about Bitcoin before investing. We might see a maximum price of $185,000, with a minimum price of $115,000 and average price of $130,000. However, BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes predicted the BTC price to touch $700K in 2026. Bitcoin price prediction 2027 Based on a detailed technical analysis of past Bitcoin price data, it is projected that in 2027, Bitcoin could see a minimum price of $140,491. The potential maximum price is estimated to be $216,738, with an average value of $170,100. Bitcoin price prediction 2028 By 2028, Bitcoin’s price is expected to reach a low of $164,063. Maximum price projections are as high as $244,142, averaging about $185,068 for the year. Bitcoin price forecast 2029 Projections for 2029 suggest that Bitcoin could be valued at a minimum of $195,629. The price may peak at as much as $255,321, with an average throughout the year expected to be around $200,312. Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction 2030 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $225,903 and potentially rise to a maximum of $270,593.

Bitcoin price prediction 2031 The forecast for 2030 suggests that Bitcoin’s price could start at a minimum of $285,058 and potentially rise to a maximum of $350,548.

Cathie Wood of Ark Invest forecasts Bitcoin may hit $600,000 by 2030, with a potential rise to $1.5 million in her bull case scenario after Bitcoin ETF approval (Bitcoin exchange traded funds). Cryptopolitan’s Bitcoin (BTC) Price Prediction A surge in bitcoin adoption and the expansion of the Bitcoin ecosystem might end the controversy of “Bitcoin bubble” in future. This might boost the Bitcoin cost and strengthen the Bitcoin network. At Cryptopolitan, we are bullish on Bitcoin’s future price as the historical market sentiment is extremely impressive. By the end of 2025, Bitcoin might record a maximum of $160,000, with a minimum price of $68,000 and an average price of $120,000. However, Bitcoin’s future market potential entirely depends on its buying demand, regulation, and investor sentiment regarding long-term holdings. Crypto analysts provide a positive sentiment as macroeconomic trends turn promising. We expect Bitcoin price to surpass a high of $216,000 by the end of 2027. Bitcoin historic price sentiment BTC price history: Coinmarketcap Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, marking the first use of blockchain technology. Bitcoin was initially of little value, gaining significant traction and hitting over $15,000 during the 2017 boom, with further highs reached in 2019 and 2021. In 2021, Bitcoin peaked at $68,789.63 but dropped to $15,760 by December 2022 amid economic pressures, including inflation and geopolitical conflicts. By April 10, 2023, Bitcoin’s price surged 83%, breaking the $30,000 resistance level. Throughout mid-2023, Bitcoin’s value hovered around $30,000, nearly reaching $32,000 due to positive market sentiments and potential ETF approvals. Bitcoin experienced a significant price drop in mid-August 2023, falling to $25,000. However, its prices remained volatile, fluctuating between $26,000 and $29,500 in October. Bitcoin closed 2023 above $42,000, a 155% increase from the year’s start. In early 2024, Bitcoin rose above $45,000 on ETF anticipation but briefly dipped below $40,000 after approvals. It broke its 2021 all-time high in March, reaching $73,750.07 on March 14, before dropping below $60,000 in April. May saw another surge above $70,000, while June and July brought heavy fluctuations between $70K and $55K. Bitcoin rallied to $66K in September after a Fed rate cut, climbed to $70K in October’s Uptober rally, and surged toward $108K following Donald Trump’s victory in the November US elections. BTC ended 2024 consolidating below $95K. At the start of January 2025, BTC was trading between $92,788.13 and $95,824.39. However, it formed an ATH at $109,114 on January 20. In the weeks of February, the price of BTC dropped heavily as it dropped toward the $78K low. In March, the price of Bitcoin declined heavily and dropped toward a low of $76.6K. In April, the price of Bitcoin started recovering. By the end of April, it neared the critical $95K zone. In May, Bitcoin price skyrocketed and it formed a new ATH at $111,970. However, the price declined later, toward $104K. By the end of June, BTC price reclaimed the $108K level. In July, BTC price triggered a surge toward $123K; however, it faced strong selling pressure later. In mid-August, the price of Bitcoin surged above $124K. However, the price failed to maintain its momentum as it dropped below $110K in early-September. By the end of September, the price of Bitcoin dropped further and touched a low around $108K.",Crypto Price Predictions|BTC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|UNI|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-10-23 19:45:43

Speaking at a Turning Point USA event on October 22, the Conservative commentator said he would never invest in Bitcoin because he believes it was designed by financial elites to control society. Bitcoin’s “CIA Origins” Theory Gets New Airtime In his speech , Carlson admitted that while he loved the idea of financial autonomy that Bitcoin represented, the reality was starkly different, with crypto becoming a “scam” run by a “coalition of beneficiaries,” to further their control of American society. “I’m really afraid of a digital currency because that is totalitarian control,” he claimed. “If you can punish people, if you can zero out their bank account and keep them from eating, you will have total obedience.” The former Fox News host added that he was a gold buyer and does not invest in things he does not understand. He questioned how a trillion-dollar asset could have an anonymous creator and why Satoshi’s estimated one million BTC have never been moved. “Nobody can explain to me who Satoshi was, the creator of Bitcoin, this mysterious guy who apparently died,” said Carlson. “I grew up in DC, primarily in a government family, so, CIA,” he added. The theory that a government agency created Bitcoin has been around for a while, but Carlson’s remarks have given it renewed attention. That idea gained some traction in 2020 when The Washington Post revealed that the CIA had secretly owned Swiss encryption firm Crypto AG for decades, using it to spy on more than 120 countries by selling them rigged devices. Within hours of Carlson’s speech airing, Bitcoin supporters challenged his assertions on X. Strike CEO Jack Mallers wrote: “If you think knowing who created Bitcoin matters, you don’t understand it. Bitcoin is open source. Nobody has special rights, and everyone can verify that.” Broadcaster Max Keiser also dismissed the CIA claim, saying it contradicts the well-documented history of Bitcoin’s development. Others mocked the media personality’s distrust, with Marty Bent, host of the Tales from the Crypt podcast, remarking: “Even if the CIA did create Bitcoin (it didn’t), anyone can audit the code to see what it does. That’s all that matters.” Still, some agreed with Carlson’s broader concerns about government power. One of them, Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius Labs, while laughing off the CIA theory, argued that Carlson’s fear of financial surveillance is valid. He warned that crypto can be used for bad instead of good if built poorly. The Enduring Mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto The search for Satoshi has become a sort of global puzzle after the person, or people, behind the name completely vanished from public view in 2011. Last year, an HBO documentary suggested that late cryptographer Len Sassaman could be Satoshi. Just days before that, the film’s director pointed to Peter Todd as the man behind the pseudonym, but the former Bitcoin developer firmly denied the claim. In the same year, a UK judge formally ruled that computer scientist Craig Wright, who had claimed to be Satoshi, was not the BTC creator. Despite the setbacks, people have not given up on solving the mystery. Some, like crypto lawyer James Murphy, have taken the legal route, suing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in April 2025 for records that might reveal Satoshi’s identity.

Speaking about the fears of an AI “bubble” in a Reuters interview, he likened the current AI boom to the 1990s internet revolution and tagged it the “front end of an AI supercycle.” His comment comes as the company revealed its adjusted profit for the third quarter beat estimates. Nokia’s CEO believes AI is a driver of long-term growth Nokia’s CEO Justin Hotard is not bothered by fearmongers who insist there is a potential bubble forming in the AI sector, and his recent statements imply he thinks the journey for that sector is only just beginning. Hotard, downplaying concerns about a potential bubble, said artificial intelligence is driving a long-term growth trend that reminds him of the internet boom from the 1990s. His remarks come as debate continues over the sustainability of the surge in AI investment . “I fundamentally think we’re at the front end of an AI supercycle, much like the 1990s with the internet,” Hotard said in his interview with Reuters . “Even if there’s a bubble, a trough, we’ll look to the longer-term trends. And right now, all those trends are very favourable.” His positive outlook has not been reflected in recent surveys, with one Bank of America survey from this month showing that a considerable number of fund managers believe AI stocks are in a bubble. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman seem to fall in with the naysayers as well as they have cautioned that investor excitement could be preceding major losses. Despite the element of the unknown, demand for data centers continues to rise sharply as companies race to build the infrastructure needed to support AI. Nokia cashes in on Big Tech interest in the AI industry Hotard’s comments on the AI bubble come after it reported quarterly earnings that beat market expectations on Thursday. According to the company, this is because of strong optical and cloud demand, including sales to AI-driven data centers after its acquisition of U.S. optical networking firm Infinera. Nokia claims artificial intelligence and cloud customers had an impact of up to 6% on the group’s latest quarterly sales as network infrastructure piggybacked on data center demand. The Finnish company reported €435 million ($505 million) in adjusted operating profit for the quarter, surpassing the average analyst estimate of €324 million. This was even though Nokia cut its full-year profit guidance in July, after taking damage from the Trump administration’s tariff wars and currency fluctuations. The company now expects operating profits of €1.6 billion to €2.1 billion for 2025. Given how Nokia’s push into AI, its biggest shift since selling its mobile phone unit in 2013, has benefitted the company, it is no surprise Hotard is downplaying fears of a bubble. However, he is also right in implying the future is not set in stone. For now, mobile networks remain Nokia’s core business, but the company has been weaving AI into various areas of production, including radio access and fibre networks. Hotard took over the company in April and is expected to present his strategy for growth at a capital markets day next month.

According to data shared on social media, it was suggested that long-term Bitcoin holders (LTH) have sold approximately 28,000 BTC since October 15, exceeding the purchases of new investors. Woo noted that the data underlying these claims could be misinterpreted. According to the analyst, the definition of “long-term investor” encompasses coins that have been inactive for more than five months. Therefore, he argued that the increase in LTH supply actually indicates that purchases made five months ago have now transitioned to long-term status. Related News: BREAKING: Latest Wave in the US-China Trade War - Trump Makes a Statement, Tensions Run High Woo explained: The increase in long-term investor (LTH) supply is not real-time data; it is reflected with a 5-month lag. Conversely, the decrease in LTH supply indicates that the old supply was sold off immediately. The analyst stated that small decreases in LTH supply should generally be viewed as “local profit taking” and do not necessarily imply large sales that would create panic in the market. “There are only a few small profit-taking moves on the chart. The rest of the data, while seemingly bearish in nature, actually creates a misleading picture,” he said. *This is not investment advice.

Meanwhile, on-chain data shows that SOL is at the top of its game as the network has had a better runtime in recent days compared to major chains. Blockchain Stress Test, But Solana Shows Strength In the recent market cycle, the Solana Blockchain has notably maintained its uptime and also demonstrated robust network performance and adoption. Despite a recent outage that struck the crypto sector, the leading blockchain held its ground and ultimately delivered a great performance. As disclosed by the Solana official page on the X platform, the network has emerged as an obvious frontrunner in terms of strength and performance recently. This robust action continued even during the latest Amazon Web Service (AWS) outage that disrupted multiple blockchain networks. Despite latency and transaction delays on a few chains, SOL’s decentralized validator network and high-throughput architecture ensured smooth operations. In addition to enhancing its reputation for dependability, the network’s ability to remain stable in the face of frequent cloud outages has highlighted its increasing leadership in blockchain infrastructure efficiency and practical scalability. According to the report from the page, Solana outperforms all other large crypto networks in terms of performance during the AWS outage, with no impact on throughput. The persistent uptime was probably fueled by steady developer and staking activity across its entire ecosystem . Furthermore, the data shows that the SOL network is now ranked in first position in terms of resilience , reflecting its unmatched network stability and performance under pressure. This remarkable milestone was achieved by the leading blockchain with the lowest percentage (%) of stake residing in AWS. Given its low-cost transactions, expanding yield opportunities, and growing institutional interest, this milestone did not come entirely as a shock. Such achievement strengthens Solana’s standing as a cutting-edge blockchain designed for innovation. SOL Draws Traders From Other Chains SOL is turning out to be the blockchain choice for both retail and institutional players. In a post on the X platform, SolanaFloor reported that traders appear to be returning to Solana following several weeks of BSC (Binance Smart Chain) meme season. At the forefront of the renewed capital flow into the ecosystem is Pump.fun. According to the platform, Pump.fun has taken the lead once again in terms of token graduates and token creations within a 24-hour period. While traders are returning to SOL , over $8 million in net inflows from BSC to Solana have supported the move in the past week, a development that highlights growing capital rotation back into the SOL trenches. The return of traders is cementing SOL’s reputation as a more robust layer 1 network in the broader cryptocurrency landscape.",Solana|Amazon Web Service|AWS|Binance Smart Chain|BSC|Meme Season|Pump Fun|SOL|SOL news|SOL price|solana|Solana news|Solana price|SolanaFloor|solusd|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|SOL|BNB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 20:00:21

This has raised concerns that BTC could suffer a further crash, as holders who are in the red may move to offload their coins. Bitcoin Supply In Profit Drops Amid Market Crash On-chain analytics platform Glassnode revealed in a report that the Bitcoin supply in profit has historically dropped to around 85%, with 15% of the supply sitting at a loss. This has occurred whenever the BTC price breaks down from a new all-time high (ATH) and trades around the short-term holders’ cost basis, as is happening now. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Supercycle Still In Play? Wave 3 Tells A Story Of A Surge Glassnode noted that this marks a pivotal phase for Bitcoin, as this is where the market tests the conviction of investors who had bought near recent highs. This pattern is said to be playing out for the third time in this current cycle. The on-chain analytics platform warned that if BTC fails to recover above the $113,100 range, a deeper contraction could send a larger share of the Bitcoin supply into loss. Glassnode further stated that this deeper contraction could amplify the stress among recent Bitcoin buyers, which could set the stage for a broader capitulation across the market. The platform also alluded to the Supply Quantile Cost Basis to explain why it is essential for BTC to reclaim the short-term holders’ cost basis above $113,000. Bitcoin is said to be struggling to hold above the 0.85 quantile at $108,600. Failure to hold this has historically indicated structural market weakness and often preceded deeper corrections toward the 0.75 quantile, which now aligns near $97,500. This puts BTC at risk of dropping below $100,000 for the first time since May. A Longer Consolidation Phase May Be Necessary Glassnode stated that from a macro perspective, the repeated demand exhaustion suggests that Bitcoin may require a longer consolidation phase to rebuild strength. This exhaustion is said to be clearer with the Long-Term Holder Spend Volume. These long-term holders have increased their spending with the 30D-SMA rising from the 10,000 BTC baseline to over 22,000 BTC daily since the market peak in July. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin About To See A Repeat Of 2020-2021? What Happened After The Last Flash Crash Glassnode noted that such persistent distribution indicates profit-taking from seasoned investors, which has contributed to the current Bitcoin weakness. Bitcoin OGs have continued to offload their coins at an unprecedented rate, putting significant selling pressure on BTC. Onchain Lens recently revealed that a particular whale moved 3,003 BTC to Binance, likely in a bid to sell, while also shorting BTC with a position worth $227 million. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $108,800, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Our Pi network price prediction anticipates the Pi price to reach a maximum level of $0.3195 by 2025. In 2031, the Pi price prediction expects Pi to reach a maximum level of $3.14. Pi Network, founded by Stanford PhDs Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis and Dr. Chengdiao Fan, is a social crypto and developer ecosystem built for real-world utility and mass accessibility. In 2025, Pi Network is entering a crucial stage, despite market sentiment remaining cautious; on-chain activity and ecosystem growth continue to develop. Notably, Pi recently recorded a new all-time low of $0.1585 on Oct 11, 2025, down sharply from its February peak of $2.98, underscoring the token’s high volatility in the crypto market. Despite this, key fundamental factors are keeping investor interest alive. The Passkey Update introduced stronger wallet security through Face ID, fingerprint, and PIN authentication ahead of the long-awaited Mainnet launch. Meanwhile, the Pi Hackathon 2025 has reached its halfway point, with developers showcasing projects that could expand the Pi ecosystem. At the same time, Pi has drawn attention from a partnership with Sign Protocol, backed by Binance’s venture arm, fueling speculation of a potential Binance listing. In this article on Pi Network price prediction, we analyze recent technical factors and fundamental developments, including price history, key support levels, resistance levels, and multiple technical quantitative indicators, to assess whether Pi’s current forecast points to recovery or further decline between 2025 and 2031.

Pi Network’s price has shown a moderate recovery after recent crypto market turbulence that drove it to a new monthly low earlier this month. Resistance is observed between $0.23 and $0.25, while support lies between $0.198 and $0.21. As of October 23, 2025, Pi Network’s price analysis has shown a slight recovery, indicating that the crypto market is attempting a moderate recovery after recent market turbulence. The coin traded around the $0.2031 mark today, reflecting a 0.31% daily gain despite previous selling pressure. Market data reveals weakening momentum in recent weeks, though buyers are cautiously re-entering. The current PI network resistance is between $0.23 and $0.25, while support holds at $0.198 and $0.21. Pi Network 1-day price chart analysis The 1-day chart for Pi Network price indicates a moderate bullish recovery after recent heavy selling pressure. The price increased to $0.2031 today, reflecting a 0.31% daily gain as buyers slowly re-enter the market. Green candlesticks on the chart suggest renewed accumulation following weeks of consolidation around the $0.19 zone. Market activity shows that momentum remains weak but improving as Pi attempts to establish a short-term base. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The Relative Strength Index is at 31.57, with its signal line at 27.49. This level is close to the oversold zone, showing that selling pressure has eased and that Pi might be preparing for a recovery. The RSI curve is starting to rise, indicating early accumulation by traders anticipating a rebound. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator further supports this outlook. The MACD line at 0.0024 has crossed slightly above the signal line -0.0249, showing a weak but emerging bullish momentum. The histogram displays small green bars, hinting at declining bearish strength and the possibility of a short-term upward continuation if buying pressure persists. Resistance for Pi Network is currently observed between $0.23 and $0.25, marking the upper consolidation range, while support lies between $0.198 and $0.21. The narrowing distance between price candles and these key levels reflects reduced volatility and cautious optimism among traders. Pi/USD 4-Hour Price Analysis Pi Network is trading at $0.2036, up by 0.49% over the last 4 hours. Price shows a mild recovery from prior dips, with price action gathering in the $0.20–$0.21 band. Session candles are tight, which signals reduced volatility and a stabilizing range. The RSI is at 49.98 with its signal near 44.47. This is in neutral territory and points to balanced conditions. A push above 50–55 would strengthen the bullish case. A sustained rise toward 60 could confirm improving momentum. PI/USDT Chart: TradingView The MACD line is at 0.0002 and is positioned above the signal line -0.0011. The histogram has turned positive around the zero line. This crossover implies fading bearish pressure and an early, bullish bias. Immediate resistance is between $0.205 and $0.206, followed by $0.210 and the broader $0.23 area. Nearest support sits between $0.200 and $0.201, with a deeper floor around $0.198.

Pi price is expected to remain in a consolidation phase between $0.20 and $0.24 over the short term. The token is still oversold, suggesting limited buying momentum but potential for a rebound if demand increases. However, bearish pressure persists. Unless Pi breaks above $0.25 resistance, sideways trading with a weak bias is likely, while a drop below $0.20 could trigger further bearish momentum. Is Pi a Good Investment? The Pi Network is expected to remain within the price range, and further downside remains likely unless it breaks and holds above the $0.3610 resistance level with rising volume. Traders should watch for a potential test of lower support zones if current trends persist. A reversal would require the RSI to climb above 50 and the MACD to cross bullishly, neither of which has happened yet. In the short term, caution dominates the market outlook for Pi. Why is PI’s price down today? Pi Network (PI) is down due to a combination of bearish technical signals, ongoing delays in ecosystem upgrades, and low liquidity. The RSI indicates oversold conditions, but MACD confirms continuing bearish momentum, with the token struggling to hold the $0.20 support level. Market-wide caution, driven by the broader crypto market downturn and skepticism about Pi’s mainnet launch, has led to further selling pressure on Pi. Will Pi Price Reach $5? At the current pace of development and given its circulating supply of over 8 billion PI, Pi Network’s value is unlikely to reach $5 in the near term. Multiple technical quantitative indicators and fundamental factors, such as delayed mainnet launch and continuous token unlocks, suggest that Pi’s price may fluctuate within lower ranges before any major uptrend. A $5 target would require sustained adoption, significant on-chain activity, and strong market demand that is not yet present. Will Pi Reach $10? Reaching $10 would represent a massive increase in Pi’s market cap, something that is not expected soon under current crypto market conditions. Analysts suggest that even optimistic forecasts place this milestone more than a decade away, if at all. Investors should treat such projections as speculative and conduct their own research before making investment decisions, as Pi remains a high-risk asset with uncertain long-term value.

Pi Historic Price Sentiment Pi Price History: CoinMarketCap Pi Network launched in 2019 with a mobile mining model. During these years, it operated in a closed network with no official market price, as tokens couldn’t be traded externally. In 2023, the token was still largely unlisted on major exchanges. Price remained speculative, often appearing in unofficial markets with wide variances. By early 2024, the first signs of market traction were still limited. Prices ranged between $0.60 and $1.00 over-the-counter or in the sandbox. In February 2025, official market traction began. Pi hit its all-time high (ATH) of $2.98 on February 26 after initial listings or increased public speculation. In March 2025, the price dropped significantly when Pi Network had an unstable phase after the expiration of its final KYC verification deadline. Traded between $1.85 and $0.90, gradually declining through the month. In April 2025, Pi Network hit its all-time low (ATL) of $0.4012 on April 5. Prices ranged between $0.40 and $0.65, showing weak recovery momentum. In May 2025, the Pi Network surged toward $1.67 but failed to maintain its buying demand. This resulted in a significant downward pressure toward $0.75 by the end of the month. In June, Pi showed a sideways-to-bullish movement, with the potential to break above $0.66 and target $0.72. At the start of July 2025, Pi Network faced high volatility as massive token unlocks triggered strong selling pressure, keeping prices around the $0.458–$0.50 range. On July 19, 2025, PIUSDT declined slightly to $0.4412, reflecting short-term bearish pressure. On July 26, 2025, PIUSDT continued to hover under pressure around $0.4409, staying within a tight trading range as momentum remained subdued. for August 2, 2025. Pi traded at $0.3496, still under pressure and at its all-time low. On August 6, 2025, Pi Network is traded at around $0.3410, showing moderate consolidation with weak momentum and limited price movement. On August 9th, Pi/USDT went up from its early August low of $0.3766 and traded around $0.4103. August 17th, 2025, the Pi Network (PI) traded at $0.387 , showing slight movement between support at $0.383 and resistance at $0.390 . On August 21, Pi Network (PI) traded near $0.366, showing a modest 1.39% gain as buyers attempted a short-term recovery. On September 2, 2025, Pi network traded around $0.34, just above its past month’s August all-time low of $0.3304. On September 22, 2025, Pi crashed to a new all-time low (ATL) of $0.2234, marking a –92% drop from its February ATH and reflecting heavy sell-side pressure from token unlocks and weak demand. Pi rebounded slightly, to trade between $0.25 and $0.28 through late September, though resistance at $0.30 continued to hold firmly.

This week, daily trading volumes on major prediction‑market platforms surpassed $2 billion, according to Dune Analytics. Both trading volumes and user numbers are rising, reflecting accelerating interest in crypto betting, web3 sports betting, and bitcoin betting on smart contract-based prediction platforms. Prediction markets and betting platforms aggregate collective knowledge, being often more accurate than traditional polls or expert forecasts. As noted by Alex Tabarrok , professor of economics at George Mason University, on the a16z crypto podcast: “They tend to be better than complicated statistical models… They tend to be better than polls, or at least as good. And there’s one reason for that: in making bets on the prediction market, I push the prediction market closer to the truth!” Web3 infrastructure enhances this trend by tokenizing events themselves, making them tradable on decentralized betting platforms and bitcoin sportsbooks. Users can engage in online betting with cryptocurrency, esport betting, or sport betting, often without intermediaries, creating decentralized sports betting ecosystems with global accessibility. The most popular topics remain politics and sports. Last week, political markets recorded $322.6 million in trading volume, while sports markets reached $414.7 million. “Sports and politics are the most emotionally charged topics. People care deeply about their teams and elections as if they were personal, and they want to test how accurate their intuition is. These are constant news‑makers, with clear outcomes — victory or defeat — making them perfect for betting and prediction markets,” says Vladislav Petkevich, UBO of Dexsport , an esport crypto betting platform. Decentralization and reduced barriers to entry are key drivers. Platforms like Polymarket and other crypto bookmakers remove intermediaries. Everything operates on blockchain smart contracts. Participants can bet anonymously and globally, bypassing banks, brokers, or licenses. This opens markets to users in regions where traditional betting or financial systems are restricted. Industry reports project strong growth for prediction crypto markets. The decentralized prediction markets industry could expand from roughly $1.4 billion in 2024 to $95.5 billion by 2035, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~46.8%.

Here’s What Happened,https://timestabloid.com/is-ripple-hinting-at-an-xrp-price-rally-heres-what-happened/,"When a major blockchain firm begins to beef up its treasury operations, raise funds, and link its ecosystem to institutional finance, the question naturally arises: Are they preparing for the asset to move higher? Recent corporate maneuvers by Ripple Labs alongside commentary from influencer Mickle are stirring fresh speculation that XRP could be positioned for a price rally. The debate now centers on whether such actions amount to nothing more than operational expansion, or whether they represent a clear corporate thesis that XRP must go up. What Mickle Says In a clip posted on X, Mickle asserts: “Ripple thinks the price of XRP is going much higher; you don’t launch a treasury company unless you believe that the price is going up or down, and if Ripple believes the price is going higher, then you’d better believe it also. I don’t think there’s any question about this”. Going further, he argued that “XRP being at such high prices is not only good for us, but very good for Ripple and everyone in our ecosystem. Everyone wants to see, and just like you and I think XRP will be significantly higher in the future.” Is Ripple Hinting at an XRP Price Surge? #XRP #Crypto pic.twitter.com/yRXys9SpZp — mickle (@xrpmickle) October 22, 2025 In his view, the very act of launching treasury-oriented companies tied into the XRP ecosystem signals that Ripple expects meaningful appreciation , and he invites readers and investors to draw the same conclusion. Corporate Moves: More Than Just Talk Beyond commentary, public filings and media coverage show Ripple and affiliates taking tangible steps into treasury infrastructure. Notably, Ripple’s acquisition of a major treasury-software provider and its backing of an entity aiming to raise over US$1 billion to accumulate XRP adds weight to the suggestion of strategic intent. These are not casual side-projects: they are precisely the kind of moves one expects when a firm foresees an upward trajectory in its native token. Supply, Demand, and Ecosystem Dynamics If a large treasury vehicle begins accumulating XRP , the implications are two-fold. First, direct demand may tighten available supply, especially in a crypto market where movement can be lumpy. Second, ecosystem sentiment may shift when insiders are seen putting capital behind an asset; others tend to follow. Nevertheless, execution matters: how quickly purchases are made, how transparent the policy is, whether reserves are locked up, and whether the token’s role in Ripple’s product stack expands all factors into whether the accumulation story translates to price. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Cautions and Context Mickle’s interpretation is compelling, but several caveats remain. Corporate intent does not guarantee market movement. Treasury operations may shift strategy, market conditions may change, and regulatory frameworks, especially since Ripple has had high-profile interactions with regulators, can affect execution. Additionally, even when accumulation is happening, price responses may be muted if many had anticipated the move. As some analysts note, news announcements often spark spikes that fade without follow-through. Final Thoughts The substantive corporate decisions by Ripple, combined with Mickle’s commentary, form a coherent narrative that the company expects XRP to move higher. While it would be unwise to interpret the signal as a sure bet, the alignment of ecosystem development, treasury strategy, and community messaging does elevate the probability of a positive price outcome. For those watching XRP, the prudent stance is to monitor execution and market reaction rather than rely solely on intent.
