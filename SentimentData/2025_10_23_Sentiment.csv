Still, the latest dips could be setting the stage for one of the strongest bullish rallies in recent history. In early October, Bitcoin skyrocketed to a record-breaking $126,080, briefly sending capital surging into major altcoins and the best meme coins , many of which had already shattered their previous yearly highs. That momentum didn’t last long. Later that same week, the market slipped sharply after former President Trump announced a 100% tariff on Chinese imports. Investor sentiment quickly turned cautious in anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC decision. Nonetheless, several analysts view the correction as a necessary cooldown, clearing out excessive leverage and weaker positions before the next sustained uptrend. Below are three top altcoins to consider based on their upside potential. Ripple (XRP): 2025’s Cross-Border Payment Powerhouse Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , underpins a global payment system known for rapid transactions and ultra-low fees, posing a growing challenge to legacy networks like SWIFT. Backed by the UN Capital Development Fund and partnered with prominent U.S. financial institutions, XRP has risen to become the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, currently valued at $143.8 billion. The introduction of Ripple’s dollar-pegged stablecoin, RLUSD, underscores the company’s ambition to capture a share of the booming stablecoin sector. Over the past 12 months, XRP has gained 349%, reaching a seven-year high of $3.65 in mid-July, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 62% growth in the same period. With an RSI reading of 39 and a clear divergence from its 30-day moving average, XRP appears poised for renewed upward movement this week. Technical patterns reveal two bullish flags formed over the summer, suggesting potential for continued growth if ETF approvals materialize by mid-October. Should U.S. lawmakers enact comprehensive crypto legislation, XRP could climb even further, possibly landing between $5 and $10. Solana (SOL): Ethereum’s Prime Rival and This Week’s Market Leader Solana ($SOL) continues to reinforce its reputation as one of the fastest and most scalable blockchain platforms. With a market cap hovering above $100 billion and almost $11 billion locked in its DeFi ecosystem, Solana’s network expansion shows no signs of slowing down. Investors are closely watching for potential approval of U.S.-based Solana spot ETFs, which could attract significant institutional inflows similar to those seen with Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs. After bottoming out near $100 in April, SOL now trades around $184. Improved regulatory clarity has lifted investor confidence, while technical indicators, an RSI of 40, and a notable deviation from its 30-day moving average, suggest SOL might currently be undervalued. Support remains firm around $150, with major resistance near $250. A clean break above this level could spark another major rally, potentially revisiting its all-time high of $293.31 or even surpassing $500 in a strong bull market. TRON (TRX): Justin Sun’s Blockchain Defies the Downtrend Founded in 2017 by Justin Sun, TRON ($TRX) was designed as a direct competitor to Ethereum. Today, it stands as the second-largest layer one “Ethereum killer” after Solana, boasting a market cap of roughly $30.4 billion compared to Solana’s $100.6 billion. Like Ethereum and Solana, TRON supports sophisticated smart contracts that power a wide range of DeFi applications, from gaming and NFTs to lending and asset tokenization. At present, TRON is the only top-10 cryptocurrency posting gains amid a market-wide decline. While the global crypto market capitalization of $3.74 trillion fell 5% overnight, with Bitcoin dropping 4% and Ethereum and Solana both shedding about 6%. Meanwhile, TRON only fell 1% to $0.3127. Currently, TRON remains 25% below its all-time high of $0.4313, recorded on December 4, 2024. The sharp upward movement on its chart shows a rapid surge of buying activity that drove a 76% increase within 24 hours. TRON may encounter resistance near its prior peak, but a breakout could see prices approach the $0.50 mark. Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER): 2025’s Breakout Meme Coin Uniting Bitcoin Power and Innovation Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) has quickly become one of 2025’s most talked-about presale tokens. The project enhances Bitcoin’s capabilities through a proprietary Layer-2 solution, enabling lightning-fast, low-cost transfers wrapped in a meme coin format. Built for scalability and utility, HYPER introduces decentralized governance via a DAO, advanced smart contracts, and superior transaction speeds, all atop its unique Layer-2 framework. The presale has already raised over $24.5 million, with analysts predicting potential 10x or greater returns post-launch. Developed on the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM), HYPER’s ecosystem includes a seamless Canonical Bridge for Bitcoin transfers, decentralized app compatibility, and built-in meme coin integration. A recent audit by Coinsult confirmed zero security vulnerabilities, further strengthening investor trust. HYPER tokens power key network functions such as staking, governance, and transaction fees, offering early investors staking rewards as high as 48% APY. Bitcoin is going HYPER, don’t miss the start of something big. Visit the official presale website or follow Bitcoin Hyper on X and Telegram for more information.

The project recently passed a 16,000 investor milestone , indicating the large level of confidence from both retail and early institutional players. This milestone represents one of the most successful presales for 2025 . It underlines the capacity of the project to attract the trust of a cautious market still recovering from past volatility. Analysts now call MAGACOIN FINANCE a top candidate for 2025’s best crypto presale with the potential for 100x returns post-listing . Investors Rush In Before Prices Move Higher Investor growth has been faster than expected. Each of the presale rounds has closed early, indicating that interest continues to rise. Buyers are rushing to enter early to maximize their entries before the next price tier is activated. This continuous stream of investors demonstrates that their confidence in MAGACOIN FINANCE is not hype, but genuine. The project has been an eye catcher to individuals who prefer structure over bewildering marketing claims. All changes have been transparent, all progress has been visible, and all progress has been steady. That stability has ensured that MAGACOIN FINANCE is one of the most stable early-stage crypto projects in 2025. Trust Built on Transparency and Security The success of MAGACOIN FINANCE is based on transparency. The entire audit of the project was conducted by HashEx , a reputable blockchain security company that has high standards. The audit has ensured that the MAGACOIN FINANCE contract is fully safe and it has no concealed risks. This confirmation has given both new and old investors confidence that has been shaken by market deceits in the recent past. Its tiered pricing structure also adds to the fairness equation by rewarding early participants and managing token allocation. This way, a healthy ecosystem is developed, and heavy dumping is prevented after listing. Transparency, safety, and fairness have been the perfect case of reliability. MAGACOIN FINANCE is considered a safe and serious project that is not a short-term gamble. Exchange Listings Add to the Excitement The upcoming exchange listings have created more buzz among investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE will be launching on some of the popular trading platforms soon after the end of the presale. Listings often play a major role in price discovery. Analysts expect to see a strong demand from traders who did not have the opportunity to buy the token before it was available on the public market. This next step could draw in another wave of attention as investors see listings as validation. With the foundations already well-built on verified security and an increasing support from the community, the launch of MAGACOIN FINANCE on exchanges could be the start of its recognition in the wider market. As the momentum of the coin grows, there are now many calling it the best crypto to buy early, as returns are expected to increase as the liquidity rises post-launch. Analysts Predict 100x ROI Potential Analysts still believe that early players have a significant advantage. According to them, MAGACOIN FINANCE is the combination of timing, credibility, and enthusiasm of investors, three components of most 100x stories. The Patriot50X bonus , providing the buyer with 50% additional tokens included in the project, has served to solidify the enthusiasm. It has propelled fresh investors in the short run and given them the confidence to participate in the long run. The whales are also starting to silently position themselves as well, and the project is viewed as a unique early opportunity where there is safety and growth potential. Final Outlook MAGACOIN FINANCE has acquired 16,000+ investors, has passed a confirmed audit, and has verified future exchange listings. These achievements demonstrate that its emergence is not accidental – it is organized, structured, and community-driven. With transparent updates, clear rewards, and a strong foundation, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands as one of the best crypto presales of 2025 . Its stability, ease, and earlier trust place it in an ideal position to serve a market that is willing to trust once more.

The October rally enthusiasm, aka “Uptober”, abruptly ended after President Donald Trump announced sweeping 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, a move that rattled global markets and sparked one of crypto’s sharpest one-day sell-offs in recent memory. With the Federal Reserve’s next FOMC meeting approaching, traders are adopting a cautious stance, waiting for hints of potential monetary easing that could reignite risk appetite. Veteran analysts, however, view the recent pullback as a positive development, emphasizing that steep corrections tend to purge speculative excess and leveraged positions, often laying the groundwork for more durable long-term gains. Binance Coin (BNB): Perplexity AI sees Expanding Dominance Firstly, Binance Coin ($BNB) was originally designed as the exchange’s utility token, but it has evolved into one of the most multifaceted digital assets, driving a growing ecosystem that spans NFTs, decentralized apps, and payment solutions. Source: Perplexity AI BNB’s deflationary design, sustained through Binance’s periodic token burns, continues to support its long-term price resilience by systematically reducing supply over time. Its utility now extends far beyond the Binance platform, with BNB gaining traction among merchants worldwide, from gaming platforms to travel service providers. This widespread adoption has solidified its position among the world’s top five cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. This month, BNB reached a record high of $1,369.99 before pulling back around 21%, following a strong breakout from a bullish pennant formation that developed earlier in the year. Currently showing an RSI of 47, BNB appears to be consolidating between buying and selling pressure. Should bullish momentum return, Perplexity AI believes BNB could push toward the $1,600 mark before the year’s end, while $580–$1,000 may serve as a key support zone in the event of another correction. XRP ($XRP): Claude Predicts a Potential Surge Toward $10 Claude AI’s modeling suggests Ripple’s native token, XRP ($XRP) , could see a dramatic upswing, possibly reaching between $5.50 and $6.20 by year-end, more than doubling its current value of about $2.40. Ripple’s landmark victory over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year ended a five-year legal saga, restoring investor confidence and driving XRP to a seven-year high of $3.65 on July 18. Over the past year, XRP has skyrocketed 349%, handily outperforming Bitcoin’s 62% and Ethereum’s 46% gains. Technical analysis shows three distinct bullish flag formations in 2025, two of which emerged during the summer months, often a prelude to major upward moves. Strong seasonal tailwinds in October, potential ETF approvals, favorable regulatory developments, and Ripple’s expanding global partnerships could all help XRP recover recent losses and move closer to the $6 threshold, with $10 being a sober target in a bull-case scenario. Solana (SOL): Claude Forecasts a Break Above $500 Solana ($SOL) continues to reinforce its standing as one of the premier smart contract blockchains, boasting a market cap of more than $100 billion and almost $11 billion in total value locked (TVL) across its DeFi ecosystem. Speculation is heating up that U.S. regulators could approve a spot Solana ETF before the month’s end, a move that could attract substantial institutional capital, echoing the surges seen after Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF launches. Solana also stands to benefit from broader industry trends such as the tokenization of real-world assets and the expansion of stablecoin infrastructure, both of which are gaining institutional momentum. Additionally, with transaction speeds and fees outpacing Ethereum’s, Solana remains one of the strongest contenders for mass adoption. After rising to $250 in January and retracing to $100 in April, SOL now trades near $184, suggesting renewed bullish potential. Its low RSI of 40 and proximity below its 30-day moving average indicate the asset may currently be undervalued. Having recently broken out of a bullish flag pattern, Claude projects that Solana could reach between $360 and $500 by year’s end, a rise of up to 70% above its previous all-time high of $293.31. Missed Dogecoin? Meet Maxi Doge (MAXI): The Next-Gen Meme Coin With Degen Energy Maxi Doge ($MAXI) , a new entrant in the meme coin arena, has launched its presale phase, already drawing over $3.7 million from investors eager to ride the next viral crypto trend. Branded as Dogecoin’s “high-octane cousin,” Maxi Doge embraces the humor, hype, and community-driven ethos of crypto’s degen culture, focusing on engagement, viral memes, and grassroots participation. Developed as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, MAXI offers quicker, more cost-efficient, and eco-friendly transactions compared to traditional meme coins. The project’s marketing strategy centers on Telegram and Discord community events, trading competitions, and influencer collaborations to build early traction. Of its total 150.24 billion token supply, 25% is allocated to a “Maxi Fund” dedicated to marketing, ecosystem growth, and strategic partnerships. Staking is live, with yields reaching up to 82% APY, a figure that gradually decreases as more stakers join. The presale currently values MAXI at $0.000264, with incremental price increases set for each funding milestone. Investors can purchase tokens via MetaMask or Best Wallet .

Experts are now targeting a potential rise toward $200,000, identifying this new all-time high level as Bitcoin’s potential cycle top while suggesting that the cryptocurrency has yet to establish a definitive bottom. Bitcoin Price Explosion To Ignite Biggest Altcoin Season Ever According to digital asset analyst CrediBULL Crypto, Bitcoin’s next parabolic surge could catalyze the biggest altcoin season the market has ever seen. The analyst shared an Elliott Wave chart analysis, showing that BTC is in the early stages of its final fifth wave, a phase that has historically delivered some of the most explosive price rallies in bull markets. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Supercycle Still In Play? Wave 3 Tells A Story Of A Surge Looking at the chart, the first subwave of Wave 5 has already produced a 37% gain, suggesting that the upcoming third and fifth subwaves could be significantly larger, potentially driving Bitcoin well above $150,000 and even toward the $200,000 mark. CrediBULL Crypto argued that such a bullish move will not be grounded in logic or fundamentals but in market psychology, specifically speculation, greed, and euphoria. He revealed that this emotional environment often leads to extreme volatility, which fuels liquidity rotation into alternative cryptocurrencies. Historically, when investors begin redirecting capital away from Bitcoin into altcoins after a BTC top, it typically sparks a full-blown altcoin season. Many smaller-cap assets experience rapid, exponential gains during this time, especially as the Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) declines temporarily. CrediBULL Crypto emphasizes that this phase of irrational exuberance is a natural part of the market cycle. When the Bitcoin mania peaks, the resulting FOMO often drives investors to seek higher and faster yields in other assets. The analyst further added that as long as BTC continues to climb, altcoins are likely to follow suit. Analyst Recommends Locking In Ahead Of The Rally In a prior analysis on X social media, CrediBULL Crypto reaffirmed his belief that the current market cycle top has not yet been reached. Despite recent volatility and market crash fueled by the devastating liquidation event on October 10, the analyst maintains that Bitcoin remains structurally bullish on High-Timeframes (HTFs). Related Reading: Expert Says ‘The Time Has Come’, What Could Drive The Next Explosive Altcoin Season He noted that the recent market pullbacks could offer opportunities for traders affected by the liquidation cascade to rebuild positions ahead of the next explosive leg. He stated that even a small allocation, about 10% of their previous holdings, could yield substantial returns if the projected parabolic move unfolds. CrediBULL Crypto has highlighted a critical invalidation level near $74,000, suggesting that as long as the Bitcoin price holds above this zone, its long-term uptrend remains intact. He doubled down on his bullish projection, insisting that the next major rally could propel BTC significantly above $150,000.

Waller at the Payments Innovation Conference on October 21, 2025, Fed staff are examining a new kind of account that would let certain non-bank firms connect directly to the central bank’s payment system. Reports have disclosed the idea is being called a “payment account” or informally a “skinny” master account. What The Federal Reserve Is Proposing The plan would stop short of giving full bank privileges. The accounts would likely not earn interest and would not have access to the Fed’s discount window. Balance caps and other risk limits are expected to be part of the design. Waller said staff are still working through the details and that the concept remains exploratory rather than a finalized rule. Limits And Safeguards Regulators intend to keep guardrails. According to public comments, only “legally eligible” entities would qualify. That phrase leaves open which corporate forms — for example, trust companies, state-chartered firms or other charter types — will be allowed. Fed opens the gates for fintech and crypto access Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller revealed today that the Fed is studying a new model of “payment accounts”. Streamlined accounts that would allow fintech and crypto firms to access the Fed’s payment infrastructure,… https://t.co/QphKaopcRo — StrongSHx (@StrongSHX) October 21, 2025 Reports note the accounts would be smaller in scope than a normal master account, with explicit restrictions aimed at reducing exposure to the payment system. Oversight, AML/KYC checks and operational risk controls are expected to be central to any application process. Why This Matters Now Access to the Fed’s rails has long been limited to banks, which forced many fintech and crypto firms to rely on intermediary banks. Connecting directly, even in a limited way, could reduce steps in settlement and cut certain counterparty risks. There is also context: the Fed withdrew earlier guidance on bank crypto activities this year — on April 24, 2025 — signaling a shift in tone toward integrating new players into payments. Who Stands To Gain Or Lose Crypto firms and stablecoin issuers could find it easier to move funds and settle transactions. Banks that currently provide access to non-banks may face stiffer competition for those services. At the same time, regulators and bank supervisors will still carry the burden of preventing fraud, illicit finance and operational breakdowns. Market participants are likely to watch how the Fed coordinates with the OCC and the FDIC on questions of charters and deposit insurance.

According to the UK’s top banking supervisor, granting UK banks and building societies relief on their £150 billion gilt holdings, as well as their multibillion-pound foreign government bond portfolios, would “risk forgetting one of the main lessons from the 2023 banking failures.” Speaking at the annual Mansion House regulators’ dinner in London on Wednesday, Woods said such a move would be “equivalent to ripping off our jacket, warm hat and gloves and throwing them all over the nearest cliff,” describing it as “profound — and highly risky.” Lessons from 2023 bank failures highlight risks of relaxing leverage ratios Bank lobbyists in Britain and the United States have called on regulators this year to exclude sovereign debt from leverage ratio calculations, which dictate how much capital banks must hold for each dollar of assets. In the UK, it would release around £5 billion of equity capital currently trapped in gilt portfolios at a minimum leverage ratio of 3.25%. Woods, a BoE deputy governor who is set to step down in 2026, noted that the failure of three mid-sized US banks over two years ago — including Silicon Valley Bank — indicated “bonds issued by sound governments, if liquidated in size, can carry major consequences to banks’ balance sheets due to interest rate risk”. SVB’s 2023 collapse, which also affected its UK subsidiary, followed losses on its large US government bond holdings after interest rates rose sharply, sparking a depositor run. Woods added that lifting capital requirements on government debt could “allow a very large increase in bank leverage given the size of banks’ sovereign holdings” and would “largely remove sovereign risk from the bank capital framework” unless banks actively sell the bonds. UK Finance, the main lobbying group for British banks, has previously proposed exempting gilts from leverage ratio calculations as part of its “plan for growth” regulatory reforms. Meanwhile, in June, the US Federal Reserve proposed lowering the leverage ratio for the country’s biggest banks from at least 5% to between 3.5% and 4.25%, aligning more closely with international standards. The Fed did not include a government debt exemption in the proposal. Still, it sought feedback on it as a potential “additional modification,” amid lobbying arguments that it could improve liquidity in US Treasury markets. Financial sector urged to strengthen cybersecurity and risk resilience Speaking at the Mansion House gathering, Nikhil Rathi, CEO of the Financial Conduct Authority, stated that there is growing recognition in the UK of the need to manage cyber risks. He cited the £1.9 billion cyberattack on Jaguar Land Rover this year as an illustration of the threats faced by UK businesses. He said that too often, finance had been seen as independent of national security, with insufficient investment in long-term resilience. Rathi also noted that most catastrophe- and cyber-risks in the world remain uninsured, leaving companies, credit ratings, risk premia rates, prices, and ultimately households to bear the burden. Calling on banks and insurers to “step up”, Rathi added: “Let’s all harness the City’s expertise to address the insurance challenges. We will keep shining a light on both the risks and opportunities.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

The interest comes just weeks after the New York-based company wrapped up a $300 million funding round that valued it at $5 billion. Venture capital firms are now lining up to pour more cash in, with some discussions floating valuations as high as $12 billion. The people involved in the talks didn’t want to be named because the details are private, but the appetite for this startup is clearly heating up. Earlier this month, Kalshi said its latest round was co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital. Back in June, the company raised $185 million at a $2 billion valuation, led by crypto-focused investor Paradigm. Kalshi lets users trade on the outcomes of real-world events, anything from presidential elections and sports games to the duration of a government shutdown. In a recent post on X, co-founder and CEO Tarek Mansour said the company’s annualized trading volume hit $50 billion. Kalshi expands after court win and surging volumes For years, regulators treated prediction markets like a legal grey zone. That changed after Kalshi’s court victory last October, which gave it the right to list presidential election contracts. The ruling ignited a flood of trading on the platform, sending volumes to new highs. Kalshi used its federal license to open markets on sports contests nationwide, expanding what users can legally trade on. This move has boosted its growth and put it in a tighter race with its closest competitor, Polymarket. One person familiar with the company’s latest fundraising reportedly told Bloomberg that the new capital could “strengthen Kalshi’s position in a crowded and fast-moving space.” Both platforms have become magnets for speculators betting on everything from political outcomes to global sports events. Venture capital firms are allegedly competing for early stakes in Kalshi and even making unsolicited, preemptive offers before the company even opens new fundraising rounds. Meanwhile, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has allowed Kalshi to expand its event-based markets, but state gaming regulators, who traditionally oversee sports betting, have been pushing back in court. The CFTC says it still has concerns of market manipulation and insider trading in platforms like this. Wall Street companies and gambling operators are moving fast to partner with prediction exchanges before the industry matures. The National Hockey League this week announced multiyear partnerships with both Kalshi and Polymarket, making it the first major U.S. sports league to embrace these markets directly. At the same time, the industry is seeing an arms race in valuations.Just recently, Cryptopolitan reported that the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which owns the New York Stock Exchange, would invest up to $2 billion in Polymarket at a valuation of around $8 billion, a massive jump from its $1 billion market cap earlier this year in a Founders Fund-led round.

The automaker said the AI assistant will also tap into the cars’ data to provide alerts, pre-condition the climate inside the cars, and explain driving features. GM said the AI assistant will be preinstalled in both gas and electric cars using the Android Automotive operating system for infotainment. The company is among the first automakers to integrate the Gemini update directly into its cars. Gemini will also become the default voice recognition system, which is expected to possess strong natural language capabilities. However, given the unpredictable nature of generative AI chatbots, GM clarified that it remains to be seen how reliable Gemini will perform on the roads and whether it will consistently make other automatic adjustments, such as climate control. The company stated that its latest upgrade directly competed with Tesla’s xAI Grok and Mercedes’s ChatGPT. Richardson claims GM’s Gemini-powered AI assistant performs better GM’s Vice President of Software and Services, Dave Richardson, said his company’s Gemini-powered AI assistant will perform better than other AI assistants. However, he pointed out that one of the challenges with most AI assistants is that they are frustrating because they do not understand accents very well. They also do not know how to respond appropriately when words are not spoken correctly. Richardson asserted that the most remarkable thing about large language models (LLMs) is that they appear to be unaffected by the above problem. He clarified that such systems have context about previous conversations, which they can retrieve for reference. “They’re flexible in how you speak to them…so overall you’re getting a better, more natural experience.” – Dave Richardson , Vice President of Software and Services at GM The automaker believes that the Gemini-powered AI assistant will make drafting and sending messages, prepping for meetings, or even planning routes with extra stops on the go an enjoyable experience. The assistant will also have internet access, enabling it to crawl the web for answers to specific questions. However, Richardson stressed that drivers will have control over the information accessed or used by the assistant. GM said the new voice assistant is a step towards developing its custom-built AI to connect to cars through GM’s in-car concierge, OnStar. The assistant will be available via Google’s Play Store as an over-the-air upgrade to OnStar-equipped cars produced from 2015 onwards. GM unveils plans for a hands-off, eyes-off driver-assistant system At the GM Forward event, the automaker’s CEO, Mary Barra, announced that her company plans to introduce a new driver-assist system, allowing drivers to take their eyes off the road or be hands-free, starting in 2028. She added that the company was also showcasing other initiatives designed to transform its cars from modes of transportation to intelligent assistants. GM further announced that it is developing a new centralized computing platform, which is expected to start rolling out with the Escalade IQ in 2028. Barra said at the event in lower Manhattan that her company is ready to usher in a new era of mobility. Sterling Anderson, GM’s Chief Product Officer, said the company’s vision is to produce a car that knows and looks out for its driver. Anderson believes centralized computing is a foundational piece of GM’s plans to improve the capabilities of its cars. The automaker also emphasized its plans to upgrade ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems) to feature eyes-off, hands-free driving technology. GM expects to roll out the driving assistance feature in 2028, beginning with the Cadillac Escalade IQ EV. Anderson said this autonomy will make roads safer. Anderson explained that GM’s future cars will utilize lidar (light detection and ranging) systems to enhance their ability to detect their surroundings. He added that the system is expected to reach its full potential through incremental transformations. Get seen where it counts.

With this integration, Bealls becomes the first national retailer to accept digital currencies from any crypto wallet across more than a dozen blockchains at once. The announcement marks Bealls’ 110th anniversary and highlights the company’s ongoing focus on innovation and improving customer experience. Over the years, the retailer has invested in new technologies, such as in-store kiosks and online shopping, and this latest move places it among the early adopters of crypto payments in physical retail. Bealls Makes a Crypto Leap According to the official press release, the system supports a wide range of assets, including stablecoins and meme coins. Customers will be able to make purchases using digital currencies at Bealls, Bealls Florida, and Home Centric stores. As part of the deal, the retailer will utilize Flexa Payments, a digital payment solution designed for speed and versatility. The platform enables merchants to accept over 99 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and stablecoins such as USDC, from more than 300 different wallets. Flexa Payments connects with existing retail systems and operates across mobile, in-app, and in-store environments. It also delivers near-instant transaction processing while automatically supporting new currencies and wallet applications as they become available. The partnership comes as more Americans are turning to digital assets for everyday transactions. Bealls cited a study that revealed that, as of early 2025, around 28% of US adults, which is estimated to be about 65 million people, own cryptocurrency. The collaboration with Flexa broadens the company’s footprint in brick-and-mortar retail while simultaneously advancing its goal of making digital payments as simple and widely accepted as card or mobile wallet transactions. In a statement, the Florida-based company’s Chairman and CEO, Matt Beall, said, “Digital currency will reshape how the world transacts, and Bealls is proud to be at the forefront of that transformation. Our partnership with Flexa is about more than payments; it’s about preparing for the future of commerce and continuing to innovate for the next 110 years.” Institutions Diving Deeper into Digital Assets Bealls’ move reflects a wider trend across finance and commerce, where institutions are steadily increasing exposure to blockchain-based investments. A study conducted by State Street found that allocations to cryptocurrencies, digital cash, and tokenized securities are expected to more than double by 2028. Over half of those surveyed believe tokenized assets will form up to a quarter of total portfolios by 2030. Asset managers are especially active, holding more Bitcoin and Ethereum than asset owners. A small but growing share is even experimenting with newer categories like meme coins and NFTs.

BTC is now up ~15% year-to-date and sits ~13% below its record close from earlier this month. ETH is now up ~16% year-to-date and is ~20% below its record close from August 2025. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high-risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price fell to its lowest level in over three months this week. BTC is now up ~15% year-to-date and sits ~13% below its record close from earlier this month. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price dropped further this week, hitting its lowest level in over two months. ETH is now up ~16% year-to-date and is ~20% below its record close from August 2025. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. A logarithmic scale is used on the y-axis of this chart to better illustrate the relative percentage changes and long-term growth of these cryptocurrencies, as opposed to their absolute price fluctuations. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

With over 21,000 investors joining in and the price rising every single hour , smart money is flooding in, especially from Ethereum whales seeking a hedge and diversification play in a volatile market. The presale is nearing its final stage, and only early buyers can still claim a 50% bonus with the code PATRIOTS100X before it sells out. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale: Price Rising Hourly, No Dips, Massive FOMO MAGACOIN FINANCE has entered rare territory — a presale that rises every hour and shows no dips in momentum. The demand has been explosive, with thousands of new wallets joining daily. The project’s safe infrastructure, verified audits, and community-first model have made it one of the most trusted presales in 2025. As traders search for the best crypto presale with real traction, MAGACOIN’s growth curve continues to outpace earlier hits like PEPE. What’s different this time is with real DeFi utility , creating a token that’s fun but functional. With the final presale phase approaching, the bonus offer (PATRIOTS100X) gives early participants 50% extra tokens , but only for a short time. Once this round closes, prices are expected to list higher on both CEX and DEX exchanges , which have reportedly begun discussions with the project team. Every minute counts now — MAGACOIN’s hourly price ticks upward, making timing crucial for those who want to maximize entry before listings go live. The project’s pace suggests it could be the best altcoin to buy before 2025’s next bull run begins. Ethereum Whales Move Early — Seeking the Best Crypto Presale for Safety and Hedge Ethereum’s long-term holders have begun positioning early into MAGACOIN FINANCE, a move that many see as a signal of where smart capital is rotating. After recent market corrections across major assets like Bitcoin and XRP, institutional-sized wallets are now chasing new presale opportunities that offer both safety and growth. Ethereum remains one of the most established assets in crypto, but even large holders are diversifying into younger altcoins that combine meme energy with real DeFi use cases. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out — offering audit-backed security, transparent tokenomics, and a community-owned foundation. In times of uncertainty, whales prefer projects that show legitimacy and reliability. MAGACOIN FINANCE offers just that: Fully audited (HashEx completed, CertiK ongoing) KYC-verified team No tax on trades Clear, transparent tokenomics For many high-net-worth investors, this is the best crypto presale to buy now for both hedge and early upside , especially as the token trades under $0.0006 , a price analysts say could “cancel two zeros” in the next major rally. A Hidden Gem Under $0.0006 — New Chance After XRP and Ethereum For investors who missed Ethereum’s rise from double digits or XRP’s breakout years ago, MAGACOIN FINANCE feels like the new opportunity . It’s a hidden gem under $0.0006 , gathering serious whale attention and retail enthusiasm alike. Analysts tracking whale flows confirm growing wallet activity around the presale contract, reflecting early positioning before the final stage ends. MAGACOIN combines scarcity, safety, and smart token design , giving it a real shot at being one of the best crypto presales of this cycle. In a market full of uncertainty, MAGACOIN FINANCE has become a safe haven , a project where participants can grow without constant fear of price dips or hidden risks. With its transparent setup, hourly price increase, and upcoming exchange listings, it is not just another meme coin — it’s a secure entry into the next major wave of digital assets.

53516810,611532,1761177628,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53516810.jpeg,Tether Mints Another 1B USDT – $7B in Stablecoins Issued Since The Crash,https://bitcoinist.com/tether-mints-1b-usdt-7b-in-stablecoins-issued-crash/,"Tether has just minted another 1 billion USDT, only hours ago, reigniting debate over stablecoin-driven liquidity flows across the crypto market. The mint comes at a crucial time — Bitcoin is struggling to reclaim higher levels after weeks of volatility, while altcoins continue to bleed as if a full-blown bear market were underway. These mints tend to inject liquidity into exchanges, providing the capital needed for traders and market makers to re-enter positions or stabilize volatile price swings. While not always an immediate bullish catalyst, they frequently precede recoveries in market sentiment and volume. The latest mint follows a wave of renewed uncertainty across the crypto landscape, with investors closely watching Bitcoin’s $110K level as a make-or-break support zone. Altcoins, meanwhile, are experiencing double-digit declines, raising concerns that risk appetite remains weak. If history is any indication, this new influx of stablecoin liquidity could be setting the stage for a short-term rebound — or at least a temporary relief rally — as liquidity begins to circulate across major exchanges and derivative markets in the days ahead. A Liquidity Wave That Could Shake the Market According to data from Lookonchain, Tether and Circle have collectively minted over $7 billion in stablecoins since the October 10 market crash. This surge in new supply marks one of the most significant liquidity injections since midyear, sparking speculation about its potential impact on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market. Stablecoin mints on this scale often act as precursors to major price swings. While not a direct form of buying, they indicate that fresh capital is being positioned to enter the market — typically through market makers, institutional desks, or exchanges preparing for renewed trading activity. In this context, the $7 billion influx suggests that liquidity conditions are improving after the sharp drawdown that liquidated billions in long positions earlier this month. Related Reading: 2,496 Bitcoin Moved After Years Of Inactivity – Long-Term Holders Take Action However, such rapid capital movement can also heighten volatility. As this liquidity begins to circulate, it can amplify both sides of the market — first triggering relief rallies as buyers re-enter, and then sharp corrections as leveraged positions unwind. For Bitcoin, the timing is especially critical. With BTC still struggling to hold above $108K–$110K, this new liquidity could determine whether the next move is a bullish breakout or another leg lower. Historically, large stablecoin issuances have preceded upward shifts in Bitcoin’s price, but in a fragile market, they can also fuel speculative whipsaws. Tether’s USDT Dominance Rebounds As Traders Seek Stability Tether’s market dominance has risen sharply to around 5.06%, signaling a notable shift in sentiment as investors move capital into stablecoins amid heightened market volatility. The weekly chart shows a strong rebound from the 4.6% level, with USDT dominance now testing resistance near the 100-week moving average. This uptick coincides with the broader crypto market downturn following Bitcoin’s failure to hold key support at $110K and widespread selling across altcoins. Historically, rising USDT dominance reflects increased demand for safety — traders exiting volatile assets and parking capital in stablecoins to wait for clearer market direction. This pattern often precedes periods of accumulation, as sidelined liquidity builds up, ready to re-enter once confidence returns. From a technical standpoint, the structure suggests that a sustained breakout above 5.2% could extend the dominance rally toward 6%, a level last seen during previous market corrections. However, rejection here would imply stabilization and potential capital rotation back into risk assets.

The figure was posted on his social feed. Based on reports, that user base would represent about 6.25% of the global population. At the same time, USDT’s circulating supply is reported to be roughly $182 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whale Goes Big — $255M Longs Opened Before Trump–China Summit Tether Reports 500 Million Users The announcement came in a short social post from Ardoino celebrating the milestone. It’s the “biggest financial inclusion achievement” in history, he said. The company frames this as a major step for financial access, pointing to broad use in markets where traditional banking is limited. The method used to count “users” has not been made public, and the figure appears to be self-reported by Tether. Tether USDT reached officially 500 million users! Likely the biggest financial inclusion achievement in history. https://t.co/jbmnMDwidi — Paolo Ardoino 🤖 (@paoloardoino) October 21, 2025 Use Patterns In Emerging Markets In several emerging economies, market participants say stablecoins are used for more than trading. They are used for cross-border payments, local transfers, and as a quick store of value when local currencies fall in value. Based on reports, people and businesses often move money into USDT to avoid volatility in their own currencies. That practical use is part of why the company emphasizes the inclusion angle. Market Size And Supply Figures USDT’s reported $182 billion supply places it among the largest stablecoins in circulation. Analysts tracking on-chain data note that a large portion of stablecoin flows still occur on major blockchains and centralized exchanges. Verification And Counting Caveats The 500 million claim has raised questions from industry observers and some analysts. How a “user” is defined is unclear: It wasn’t fully disclosed in detail if it is a unique person, a wallet address, an account on a partner platform, or an aggregate of multiple identifiers. Reports emphasize that without detailed methodology, outside verification is limited. The number should be viewed as a company figure that signals scale, but not as an independently audited headcount.

If even a portion of the 500 million are new entrants to digital finance, that would be significant. Meanwhile, regulators in several jurisdictions are watching stablecoins more closely. That scrutiny could affect how stablecoins are used in payments and remittances going forward.

Attendees included Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, and Senator Chuck Schumer from New York. Other industry names like Kraken co-CEO David Ripley and Uniswap Labs’ Hayden Adams were present. Nazarov said this wasn’t the usual roundtable. “It was definitely some more senior senators speaking at once,” he said. “They realize the economic value of the industry is high, so they need to address how they are going to deal with it, they need to address it correctly.” Crypto industry demands answers Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Chainlink’s Sergey Nazarov joined a dozen leaders in a nearly three-hour sit-down and two separate meetings, first with Democrats, then with Republicans. The first session, lasting about an hour and a half, included questions from Democratic lawmakers about decentralized finance and illicit use of crypto. Schumer joined briefly. Nazarov said the tone was serious, and that lawmakers seemed focused on figuring out how to engage with the space without losing control. The second meeting ran for just over an hour and was with Republican lawmakers. According to Nazarov, they were much more direct in their support. The central topic in both rooms was the same: the market-structure legislation, which was supposed to go to markup in late October. But with the federal government in shutdown mode, nothing’s moved. The bill aims to create rules that separate commodities from securities and assign clear roles to regulators. That’s critical for companies like Kraken and Coinbase, who want to know which agencies they’ll be dealing with and what compliance looks like. Right now, that clarity doesn’t exist. “The meeting was productive, with stakeholders providing feedback and reaffirming support for a bipartisan approach,” said Jeff Naft, spokesperson for the Senate Banking Committee’s Republican side. He also pushed Democrats to commit to a markup date and stop dragging their feet. Earlier this year, both parties managed to pass a stablecoin bill, which was signed by President Donald Trump in July. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

The season will go live next week on October 28, featuring new maps, weapons, and tactical modes that expand the fast-paced combined arms combat the series is famous for. Based on the recently released trailer, Blackwell Fields, a new map, has been updated and set on an extensive air base in California. The landscape features oil wells, burning fields, and vast open spaces, ideal for massive battles that involve both ground and air vehicles. The map will debut with the season’s first phase, called Rogue Ops. EA confirms that Season One will release in three phases The first phase has also featured a new 4v4 tactical mode inspired by classics like Search and Destroy and Counter-Strike. The game allows only one life per round, making it critical for gamers to make decisions carefully. For teams to secure a win, they must either eliminate the enemy or capture a single objective point. Battlefield 6 Season One has maintained squad revives, adding an extra layer of coordination and teamwork. New kits and vehicles are also part of the latest release. Gamers can expect to wield the SOR-300 Carbine, the Mini Fix sniper rifle, the GGH-22 pistol, and equip new attachments like the Rail Cover and Low-Powered Variable Optic (LPVO). The game has also introduced a new armored personnel vehicle, which will boost defense and attack abilities across large maps. EA confirmed that Season One will open in three stages, each bringing fresh content towards the end of the year. The second phase, called California Resistance, will be released on November 18, with a new map named Eastwood. The new map features a dense battlefield inspired by Southern California’s upscale neighborhoods and golf courses. Based on the trailer, Eastwood’s map layout appears different from Blackwell Field’s open expanses. Gamers have a chance to move tanks and air vehicles within the suburban homes featuring golf carts and pools. Gamers can also engage in close-quarters firefights in hotels and country clubs. The second phase will also include the new Sabotage mode, an 8v8 limited-time experience where teams alternate between attacking and defending cargo objectives. Lastly, the third stage, called the Winter Offensive, will be released on December 9, introducing a winter-themed map. The map features an ice climbing axe melee weapon and a special limited-time event named Ice Lock. Battlefield 6 has sold over 7 million copies since launch Battlefield 6 sold over seven million copies within its first week of launch, marking one of the most successful launches in EA’s shooter portfolio. The publisher has maintained strong servers and focused on refining balance and regular patches for the Battlefield 6 series. Gaming communities have shown higher expectations as Battlefield 6 continues to evolve, blending massive warfare, detailed maps, and new tactical game modes. The publisher hopes to meet such expectations and establish the game as one of the defining multiplayer experiences of the decade. Cryptopolitan uncovered that copies of the upcoming game release for PS5 had already leaked, based on Reddit posts ahead of its official launch. Based on the posts shared on Reddit, the received copy had a PEGI rating, indicating that an unnamed European retailer sold it. The Reddit user confirmed that the servers were already online ahead of the expected official start on October 10. However, gamers who obtain earlier access usually lack online features until the official release. The disclosure signaled that EA may have already opened its servers for multiplayer testing and set up for the final pre-launch. The disc copy for the PS5 edition occupies 68GB, and it is also available on Xbox Series X. For Xbox Series S, there is a smaller version occupying only 39GB. Don’t just read crypto news.

This includes jet engines and laptops. A US official and three individuals who acquired information from US authorities noted that this move is in response to China’s recent decision to impose limitations on rare earth exports. Although this is not the only option being discussed, sources have highlighted that the proposed plan aligns with US President Donald Trump’s earlier warning this month regarding the blocking of the export of important software to the country by setting up restrictions on the global shipment of products that either utilize US software or were developed with it. Trump’s limitation plan under consideration raises controversy among individuals Trump shared a social media post dated October 10 stating that he would impose an additional 100% tariff on products shipped from China to the US. This was in addition to new export controls on all essential software, which is set to take effect by November 1. However, the president did not provide further information on the situation. This announcement heightened fear among personnel of US and Chinese technology companies. To allay these fears, credible sources have reported that there’s an excellent chance they won’t even happen. Still, two sources close to the situation acknowledged that the idea of these controls suggests that the Trump administration is considering escalating its existing conflict with China. Frightened by the impact of this trade war, some officials in the US government have called on the administration to consider a softer approach . Meanwhile, considering the intense nature of the situation, reporters reached out to US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at the White House to request that he comment on possible software restrictions on China. “I can confirm that everything is under consideration,” he asserted. Bessent further explained that if these export restrictions on products such as software, engines, or other items are implemented, they would likely be done in collaboration with their G7 partners. Interestingly, US stock markets experienced a drastic decline after Trump’s restriction announcement went viral, but analysts confirmed that they recovered some of their losses later. According to the reports, the S&P 500 ended the day down by 0.5%, and the Nasdaq was roughly 1% lower by the end of trading. Emily Kilcrease at the Center for a New American Security weighed in on the topic of discussion. She mentioned that software is a clear area where the US can apply pressure. However, according to her, enforcing such controls would be challenging and could harm US-based businesses. “You would hope they are only making threats that they plan to follow through on,” Kilcrease added. China pledges to retaliate against the US’s proposed plans with strong measures A Chinese embassy representative did not directly respond to the specifics of the US actions under consideration, but said that China firmly opposes the US imposing unilateral long-arm jurisdiction measures. The representative also pointed out that the Asian country warned it would take strong countermeasures to protect its legitimate rights and interests if the US insists on continuing with this plan, which they called a “wrong path.” In the meantime, one source with knowledge of the situation suggested that officials in the administration may announce plans to pressure China, without actually implementing these actions. Additionally, two other sources highlighted that more focused policy alternatives are being debated. Following debates about the scope of the proposed move, a source, which wished to remain anonymous, expressed that everything one can imagine is made with US software.

While XRP continues to hold a strong position in cross-border payments, its growth curve appears to be slowing as new DeFi-focused platforms rise to prominence. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly emerging as a top crypto to buy, capturing the attention of both retail and institutional investors. Currently priced at $0.035 in Phase 6 of its presale, MUTM’s momentum signals growing confidence in its innovative ecosystem. Mutuum Finance is redefining decentralized lending, offering real utility potential that many legacy altcoins can’t match. XRP Price Analysis Ripple (XRP) fell hard in recent market volatility, losing more than 50% and printing out a large wick to about $1.25, setting what now looks like a false breakout below an important level of support. On the daily chart, from an Elliott Wave view, XRP appears to be finishing microwave 5 of primary wave C, which could again set up for the run at heavy support to see the token fall more than 30% from today’s levels. In the last year, XRP has developed an expanding flat (ABC/3-3-5) and the $2.4 level has been consistently both resistance and support, drawing significant volume. Most importantly, XRP’s low correlation to Bitcoin (BTC) is an ideal candidate for strategic trading. Traders are testing these pivotal levels for the possibility of a rebound or breakdown, and others are checking out Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gaining interest for the upcoming cycle of markets in preparation, making it the best crypto to buy now. Mutuum Finance Exceeds Expectations Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming one of the most optimistic new DeFi coins. Its usage is increasing at a more rapid pace than initially anticipated, with over 17,340 investors in the presale alone, investing over $17.75 million. These figures put Mutuum Finance as the leading investment vehicle for anyone looking for a cryptocurrency with vast long-term value potential before the next bull run, earning its place as a top crypto to buy. One of the largest milestones for Mutuum Finance’s roadmap is launching its lending and borrowing protocol , which will occur soon. Version 1 (V1) will launch on the Sepolia Testnet in Q4 2025 and feature a number of decentralized finance products including liquidity pools, mtTokens, debt tokens, and the Liquidator bot. ETH and USDT will be integrated fully for borrowing and lending, creating early access for users in a secure, low-interest, and fully decentralized lending system. This accomplishment not only makes Mutuum Finance’s investment highly sought after but also makes it one of the most successful new crypto coin launches with enormous long-term growth potential. Community Participation in Daily Leaderboard MUTM leaderboard provides incentives for the biggest purchases of tokens in a 24-hour window, encouraging healthy community participation. Within the last 24 hours, the largest buyers spent $7,036 and $6,619 respectively, indicating increasing activity along with investor sentiment. The day’s top buyer gets rewarded with a $500 MUTM bonus. All users need to do is make at least one trade within a 24-hour window. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is becoming one of the best altcoins to keep an eye on this cycle. Phase 6 presale tokens are valued at $0.035, with more than 70% sold and $17.75 million raised from 17,340 investors. Daily leaderboard activity, along with $500 MUTM prizes, shows increasing community participation and investor sentiment. With its two-lending DeFi approach and upcoming V1 lending protocol on Sepolia Testnet, MUTM balances early-stage potential with actual utility. Investors who want high-growth crypto opportunities need to act now to lock up tokens before Phase 7, making MUTM a top crypto to buy for the current cycle.

53518744,611657,1761181207,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53518744.jpeg,Technical Analysis Suggests XRP’s Playbook From 2017 Could Repeat In 2025,https://bitcoinist.com/xrps-2017-playbook-reappearing/,"Crypto analyst Steph has presented an interesting comparison between XRP’s 2017 bull run and its current 2025 market structure in a post on the social media platform X. The post, which was captured with “The $XRP playbook,” noted a repetition of its early accumulation phase that preceded its massive breakout eight years ago. The technical analysis places 2017’s surge beside the altcoin’s ongoing consolidation around the $2 price level, predicting that the cryptocurrency could be entering a familiar setup for another explosive rally. XRP Might Repeat The 2017 Blueprint XRP’s price action in the past few days has been defined by the cryptocurrency looking to break past $2.5. This move comes off the back of a flash crash last week, which caused the altcoin’s price to create a strong downside wick on the daily timeframe. This downside wick, on the other hand, was a quick break to the downside amidst an its price consolidation that has been dragging on since July. Interestingly, dialing the price action many years back shows XRP has played out a similar pattern like this before. Back in 2017, the token spent months trading sideways before springing into an extraordinary vertical rally that turned it into one of the best-performing cryptocurrencies of that bull cycle. This trend, which was also noted in a technical analysis post by STEPH IS CRYPTO on X, looks at the possibility of the token repeating this rally again. The left side of Steph’s chart captures the 2017 price action vividly: a slow accumulation in early March followed by an almost parabolic ascent that pushed the price from fractions of a cent to above $3 within months. The chart highlights how the upward curvature that began around February 2017 served as the launchpad for XRP’s historic surge. By framing this as the “playbook,” Steph implies that history could be on the verge of rhyming once more. 2025 Setup: The Calm Before The Storm The right side of the chart image above shows XRP’s 2025 daily chart mirroring that 2017 accumulation curve. The token has been oscillating around mid $2 to form what looks like a rounded bottom pattern. The annotation points to November/December as the potential turning point. Steph’s projected path shows the token consolidating between $2.5 and $3 for the next few weeks before entering a strong vertical climb. The projection shows XRP breaking above $3 and then going on a climb that takes it far above its current price levels. The projection line on the chart extends toward $24. This means if the 2017-style pattern repeats, the altcoin could experience an unprecedented price appreciation that brings its new price range above $20. Steph isn’t the first analyst to look at similarities to the playbook in 2017. A similar outlook from a crypto analyst known as ChartNerd predicted a breakout to $13.5 if XRP repeats the 2017 rally.",XRP|ChartNerd|ripple|Steph|Steph is Crypto|XRP news|XRP price|XRPUSD|XRPUSDT,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 01:00:07

Bulls Hold $2.38 Support As Breakout Pressure Builds,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-bounce-in-sight/,"XRP is holding firm above the $2.38 support level after a recent pullback, suggesting that bulls may still have control. As buying pressure builds, traders are watching closely for a potential breakout that could reignite bullish momentum in the coming sessions. Early Strength Fades After Hitting $2.52 Umair Crypto, in his latest market update, noted that XRP displayed initial strength after rebounding cleanly from the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The price managed to climb to around $2.52 with a solid close on the 4-hour chart, signaling renewed buyer interest and a potential shift in short-term momentum. Related Reading: XRP Price Coils Below Resistance — Bulls Prepare For Possible Upside Explosion However, that early optimism was short-lived as XRP’s upward push lost steam before even reaching the 100-day SMA. The failure to extend higher has started to reveal some underlying weakness in the chart, with bulls struggling to sustain momentum at higher levels. Umair emphasized that the Relative Strength Index (RSI) trendline now plays a crucial role in determining the next direction. A confirmed breakdown below this RSI trendline could lead to another lower low, effectively continuing the current local downtrend and reinforcing bearish sentiment in the market. For now, the situation remains uncertain. XRP must hold firmly above the $2.38 support level and maintain strength along the RSI trendline. However, a failure to do so could expose XRP to deeper downside risks in the short term. Momentum Or Pause? The Decisive Moment For XRP MakroVision Research highlighted that XRP successfully halted its steep decline within the lower Golden Pocket region, between approximately $1.40 and $1.55, and has recovered as buying pressure resurfaced. In the short term, the firm noted that XRP is now approaching a key resistance range between $2.48 and $2.65. Related Reading: XRP Charts Telling A Tale: Q4 Setup Mirrors 2017 Bullish Breakout, Time To Buy? A failure to break above this zone could lead to temporary consolidation as the market gathers momentum for its next move. On the downside, the $1.96 level remains a critical support area, as losing it could reintroduce downside pressure. From an upside perspective, a decisive and sustained breakout above $2.65 could open the door for further gains toward $3.06. According to MakroVision Research, only a move beyond this level would confirm renewed bullish strength and restore clear upward momentum across the broader trend. In conclusion, the analyst emphasized that XRP’s precise targeting of the Golden Pocket and its swift recovery show that buyers are still active and defending key zones. However, the next major test lies in whether the bulls can generate enough momentum to overcome the $2.65 resistance and set the stage for a broader rally.

The CMA stated that platforms, including Apple’s iOS and Google’s Android, were widely used by millions of businesses and consumers. Still, it noted, rules such as the ones employed in their app stores might be “limiting innovation and competition”. According to the regulator, it found that the firms’ mobile platforms, which include operating systems and browsers on both smartphones and tablets, held a position of “strategic significance” in the market, with most UK mobile device holders being either Apple or Android users. The CMA, tasked by the government to stimulate economic growth, stated that it was following the lead of the United States, certain European countries, and Japan in targeting the two tech giants. Apple and Google push back as UK regulator weighs tougher competition rules Google, however, remarked that the CMA’s upcoming actions would reveal whether it was truly fostering competition. At the same time, Apple cautioned against following the EU’s interventionist approach, which it claimed had weakened user privacy. In the UK, nearly all smartphones operate on either Apple’s iOS or Google’s Android systems, with their app stores and browsers holding dominant or exclusive positions on their respective platforms. The CMA has previously noted that this dominance allows the two tech giants to wield significant control over digital content, services, and innovation. The regulator clarified that its decision did not imply any wrongdoing or impose immediate obligations but signaled its intent to consider “proportionate, targeted interventions” to enhance competition. Google, which earlier this month became the first company to receive a Strategic Market Status (SMS) designation for its search business, described the move as “disappointing, disproportionate, and unwarranted.” “The CMA’s next steps will be crucial if the UK’s digital markets regime is to meet its promise of being pro-growth and pro-innovation,” Google’s senior competition director Oliver Bethell said in a blog post. Apple stated that it “worked tirelessly” to create the best products, services, and user experience, and noted that Britain risked undermining this effort, potentially leading to weaker privacy and security, as well as delayed access to new features. “We’ve seen the impact of regulation on Apple users in the EU, and we urge the UK not to follow the same path.” Just recently, the iPhone maker went to court in Luxembourg to launch a legal challenge against the EU’s Digital Markets Act , a forerunner to the UK’s new tech competition rules that came into force in January. The tech firm is opposed to the DMA’s changes to its App Store and how iPhones interact with wireless accessories from other manufacturers, such as headphones. The investigations arrived at a challenging time for the CMA, which is trying to implement the new digital markets laws without being perceived as overly hostile to business. Experts urge CMA to balance fair competition with investment-friendly policies According to Tom Smith, a competition lawyer at Geradin Partners and a former CMA director, the CMA could now allow app developers to operate with greater ease, enabling them to inform customers about cheaper deals. “This is something that has already been adopted in the US, so it should not be a controversial measure,” he said. Matthew Sinclair, the senior director of trade body CCIA, noted, however, that the “opaque” designation process would cause significant uncertainty for firms innovating and investing in the UK. Sinclair continued to emphasize that it is essential for the CMA to adopt a conservative approach when considering conduct requirements and respond to the clear steer from ministers to promote investment and growth.

The initiative aims to enable BNB Chain users to participate in the world’s active prediction market directly on BSC (BNB Smart Chain). BNB Chain announced that the integration with Polymarket will enable users to deposit BNB or stablecoins on BSC and begin trading instantly. The integration will also not require complex bridging or any manual transfers between BNB Chain and Polymarket. Polymarket integrates other blockchains into its platform BNB Chain 🤝 Polymarket @Polymarket now supports direct deposits from BNB Smart Chain, letting users trade on real-world events instantly with BNB or stablecoins. 🔗 https://t.co/o9b33LUHA5 More on the news 👇 pic.twitter.com/iMrhswfATx — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN) October 22, 2025 Polymarket acknowledged that the initiative showed the expansion of real-world utility for BNB Chain users. The firm confirmed that the integration of the deposit function provides BNB Chain users with direct access to its diverse markets and liquidity, allowing them to participate in on-chain predictions without leaving the BNB ecosystem. The predictions platform confirmed that the launch focuses on new BNB-themed markets, including whether BNB reaches an all-time high by the end of the year, or if BNB hits $1,500 by the end of the year. Polymarket said the markets invite the community to express its views with real stakes. The firm argued that the price-based forecasts will offer live sentiment signals for the BNB ecosystem as liquidity grows. Polymarket believes that the initiative opens new ground for builders and users alike. The firm argued that the integration connects BNB users to Polymarket’s market environment, helping BNB Chain continue to grow as the center of real-world utility and innovation. The integration comes as Polymarket rolled out deposits and withdrawals via Hyperliquid on October 15. The firm stated that the initiative enables users to transfer funds between the two platforms, providing faster liquidity access for prediction market trading. Polymarket acknowledged that Hyperliquid’s high-speed infrastructure, which handles about 100,000 orders per second, complements its on-chain betting. The company also said the integration will have no bridging delays and leverages Hyperliquid’s fee structure, which avoids high Polygon or Ethereum gas fees. Earlier this month, Polymarket also enabled Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals. The initiative followed BTC’s surge to a fresh all-time high above $126,000. The predictions platform already supports deposits in a variety of tokens across Polygon, Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Arbitrum, and Solana. On October 13, MetaMask also partnered with Polymarket to integrate the prediction market platform directly into its wallet app. Although the integration will launch later this year, it will enable MetaMask users to buy and sell shares in prediction markets directly within the self-custodial interface. MetaMask announced that the integration will be available in most regions, including the U.S., the UK, Singapore, France, Thailand, Poland, Australia, Belgium, Taiwan, and Canada. The firm believes that the initiative supercharges Polymarket’s ecosystem, with Hyperliquid boosting on-ramp speed, while MetaMask’s over 30 million monthly users drive mainstream adoption. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s digital identity project, Worldcoin, also announced its integration into Polymarket on Tuesday. World stated that its users can download and access the new Mini App in countries where the prediction platform’s services are allowed. The launch of the Mini App on World enables World App users to participate in prediction markets using two crypto assets, USDC and Worldcoin. World also said the eligibility of Worldcoin tokens is restricted based on geography, age, and other factors. Prediction markets hit a new all-time high in trading volume The integrations come as the trading volume on prediction markets surged to new all-time highs of $2 billion on Monday. According to data from Dune, Polymarket accounted for roughly 52.3% ($1 billion) of total volume, while its rival, Kalshi, recorded about 47% ($950 million). On-chain data also revealed that Kalshi has been outperforming its competitor for eight consecutive weeks. Kalshi, the first federally regulated prediction market platform in the U.S., surpassed Polymarket in trading volume for the first time in August. The prediction platform also began beta testing its U.S. app earlier this month, in preparation for reentering the U.S. market.

He posted on Truth Social that the CEOs told him the tariffs made their stocks “soar” and saved U.S. automakers from what they described as a “hard, long slog” in the market. The new 25% import duty will take effect on November 1, but it’s already making noise across the auto industry. The announcement sent traders rushing into auto stocks, with GM shares up 14% in early Tuesday trading and now sitting 24% higher for the year, nearly 35% up in the past twelve months. Trump wrote that the tariff strategy was meant to push foreign truck makers to build more in the U.S., adding that it was working faster than expected. GM raises prices and trims losses as tariffs hit profits Inside GM, the focus is on surviving the higher costs and turning the tariffs into a financial advantage. Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told Yahoo Finance that “tariffs are getting a little bit better,” and that Wall Street should understand “it’s stabilized.” He said the company started the year surrounded by tariff noise but stayed confident it could “adjust and work through it.” Jacobson said GM is relying on its “track record” of resilience, pointing out how the company made it through the pandemic and the global semiconductor shortage. He added, “Now we’re on track to be able to lean on that record and look to a 2026 that could be better than 2025.” He also said the Trump administration wants the U.S. auto industry to be successful, citing recent trade progress with South Korea and potential relief talks involving Mexico and Canada. GM now estimates tariffs will cut $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion from profits this year, less than its earlier forecast of up to $5 billion. The company expects new tariff revisions to ease the hit, with savings expected to show up by the fourth quarter. GM also said cost cuts will offset part of the damage. To keep margins steady, GM has been raising prices on its trucks and SUVs, saying it finds “opportunities to add content and create value for the consumer” each time it updates a model. Jacobson said GM is seeing “strong demand” for full-size SUVs and trucks, allowing the automaker to tweak pricing and production to keep revenue flowing despite the tariffs. The result has been a stronger performance from its most profitable vehicles, even as component costs rise. Ford faces recall wave and factory delays after plant fire While GM works to stabilize its margins, Ford has been struggling with a wave of recalls and a supply disruption that’s affecting production lines. Ford is recalling 1,448,655 vehicles due to a rearview camera problem that can cause distorted or blank images when drivers reverse. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the defect increases the risk of a crash. This follows earlier recalls of 290,000 vehicles this month over similar issues with Ford’s 360-degree camera systems in certain lighting conditions. Earlier this year, Ford also recalled 1.1 million Ford and Lincoln vehicles in May and another 200,000 in July for related camera malfunctions. The problems pile onto Ford’s production delays triggered by a three-alarm fire last month at an aluminum plant in New York, which forced the facility to shut down until early next year. The plant supplies metal for Ford’s Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, both high-margin models. The production halt has also disrupted supply chains for Jeep SUVs, which rely on the same aluminum supplier. According to an internal memo allegedly obtained by The Wall Street Journal, Ford extended the pause on assembly of the Expedition and Navigator at its Kentucky Truck Plant through October 26. Factory workers said output of the F-Series Super Duty trucks, which can sell for over $100,000 each, has also been trimmed to manage shortages. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

This major accumulation wave has reignited investor curiosity and fueled talk about whether Dogecoin could deliver a 5x potential move before the year ends. While the spotlight shines on DOGE, a fresh name — MAGACOIN FINANCE — is turning heads with its HashEx-certified safety, growing community, and a limited-time 50% bonus for early adopters. Whale Moves Signal Growing Conviction Among Big Players Recent whale accumulation has stunned traders — over 120 million DOGE were purchased in a short span. This marks one of the largest Dogecoin whale accumulation phases of the year, according to blockchain data trackers. Analyst Ali Martinez posted on X : “10.50 billion $DOGE were accumulated at $0.21. That’s a big resistance zone forming. Keep this level on your radar!” Analyst Don echoed the sentiment: “The chart is telling us in the next few days, some kind of big news should come out for $DOGE.” This heavy buying came while retail traders remained cautious. Institutional wallets quietly soaked up DOGE during price dips — a pattern that has often preceded strong upside swings in past cycles. Many analysts see this as a strong indicator of confidence in the DOGE long-term forecast . Moreover, data shows that these whale addresses tend to hold for extended periods, often acting as market stabilizers during volatile conditions. If these whales continue adding to their positions, it may push DOGE toward a stronger Dogecoin market outlook heading into Q4. DOGE Price Prediction 2025 — Analysts Expect Momentum to Build The latest technical readings paint a mixed but promising picture for Dogecoin’s near-term price path. Several analysts expect the coin to regain momentum in the coming months, with some even predicting DOGE 5x potential gains. Kaleo , a well-known X trader, noted: “Dogecoin is expecting a swift reclaim of $0.25 soon. There’s A LOT of thin air to fill from the market nuke a couple weeks back.” Cantonese Cat added: “DOGE is having a hard time breaking above 0.886. It’s not ready to be incredibly bullish yet, but it’s close. Expect another challenge at 0.886 in Q4 2025.” DOGE price analysis The mix of whale accumulation and strong support around $0.21 has built a sturdy base. If DOGE can break through resistance levels, analysts believe it could easily climb to higher price zones, reviving talk of the best crypto to buy now among large-cap meme coins. DOGE price prediction 2025 models point toward a gradual rally, supported by renewed interest in meme coins and the foundation’s latest moves — including the Dogecoin Foundation’s acquisition of a controlling stake in the Italian soccer club U.S. Triestina Calcio 1918. This bold expansion has widened Dogecoin’s visibility, merging crypto enthusiasm with real-world influence. With such strategic steps and strong whale activity, Dogecoin whale activity 2025 could drive the next leg of growth as part of the top altcoins for 2025 bull run narrative.

Rather than relying on multiple indicators, he focuses on a single chart tracking short-term holder net unrealized profit and loss (NUPL), suggesting that this data alone may offer significant insight into whether XRP is at or near a market bottom. #XRP PRICE PREDICTION (EVERYTHING JUST CHANGED!) pic.twitter.com/UzV0J5vKp9 — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) October 20, 2025 Understanding the Indicator The chart presented compares XRP’s price ( a black line) to the short-term holder NUPL ratio (a colored line). When this colored line drops into the capitulation zone—marked in red—it signifies that short-term holders are selling at a loss. According to the analyst, historically, such moments have aligned with key market bottoms. He restricts the analysis to data from October 2024 onward, underscoring one year of price action and investor behavior. In October 2024, XRP was trading around $0.50. At that time, the NUPL ratio moved into capitulation territory. While the price did not immediately reverse, those who entered during that phase reportedly saw strong gains weeks later, as XRP rose to nearly $4. This pattern, he argues, is consistent and has been repeated multiple times. Historical Examples of Capitulation and Recovery The analyst identifies March 2025 as another pivotal moment. XRP, trading below $2, dipped again into capitulation. Following this, the price advanced toward the $3 range. A similar scenario unfolded in June 2025, when XRP declined to near $2, prompting another capitulation event among short-term holders. Shortly after, the market recovered to approximately $3.40 to $3.50. These repeated instances form the basis of his case: capitulation from short-term holders has historically aligned with optimal buying zones rather than moments of further decline. Each of the cited periods exhibited temporary fear, followed by a substantial upside within a relatively short timeframe. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Current Market Position and Analyst’s Outlook Currently, the NUPL ratio has fallen to approximately -0.2, which he notes is potentially the lowest reading ever recorded for XRP under this metric. This is even deeper than the October 2024 levels, which only approached -0.1. The analyst describes this as a stronger capitulation than previous cycles, indicating heightened fear and more severe losses among recent market participants. He stresses that such conditions, while uncomfortable, have regularly marked the final phase of downward pressure. In his view, exiting at this stage would be ill-timed, as history suggests this zone precedes recovery. He urges viewers to avoid emotional decision-making and instead focus on empirical data. Final Perspective StephIsCrypto concludes that the market may be positioned at or very near a bottom based on this indicator alone. While acknowledging broader uncertainty, he maintains that deeply negative NUPL readings convey opportunity rather than risk. Although he briefly mentions available trading platforms, the core message remains centered on the chart’s implications: panic selling has historically favored those willing to take the opposite position. The analysis ultimately frames the present environment not as a signal to retreat, but as a phase warranting attention to data rather than sentiment.

This was after the tech giant shifted the standard from two-day to same-day and even one-hour delivery. Currently, Amazon aims to save precious seconds on each delivery with robots, AI, and new eyewear assistance. Amazon’s commitment to accelerating the delivery process with its advanced glasses After reports leaked that Amazon was developing advanced glasses last year, the tech company showcased the glasses for delivery workers for the first time this week. Internally known as Amelia, these glasses feature a small screen that provides turn-by-turn directions, scans package codes, and takes photos to confirm deliveries. Considering the unique features, analysts mentioned that the tech giant’s glasses might replace the big handheld GPS devices that drivers currently use. Additionally, they noted that these glasses can provide individuals with useful navigation advice, such as suggesting which way to turn when exiting an apartment elevator or even ways to avoid an aggressive dog at a client’s house. To work effectively, sources familiar with the situation pointed out that Amazon’s advanced glasses connect to a controller attached to a driver’s vest. Meanwhile, the tech company revealed its designed swappable battery packs to solve battery life challenges. This announcement was made at Amazon’s yearly “Delivering the Future” logistics event. Notably, this event aimed to enhance the “last 100 yards” of delivery, which the company highlighted as typically the most expensive part of getting packages to customers. To illustrate its dedication to accelerating the delivery process, reports from reliable sources indicate that Amazon launched a delivery van scanner last year, which made work easier for drivers. According to these reports, the van scanner enabled drivers to identify packages at each stop by shining a green light on them, thereby saving the time that drivers would otherwise waste reading labels. Apart from this innovation, the sources also noted that the tech giant presented new digital maps to reporters in June of this year. These digital maps provide more detailed information about neighborhoods, building shapes, and obstacles compared to Google Maps. Beryl Tomay acknowledges the effectiveness of Amazon’s advanced glasses Beryl Tomay, Amazon’s Vice President of Transportation, mentioned that several drivers had already tested the advanced glasses on their routes. Following their feedback on Amazon’s advanced glasses, Tomay stated that the eyeglasses reduce the need to simultaneously handle both a phone and a package. She explained that they keep the driver focused, hence improving their safety. Hence, according to her, some drivers have saved up to 30 minutes in their shifts since news of the maneuver has spread. Tomay also noted that drivers and their contracted firms will not be forced to use smart glasses. Additionally, she mentioned that the company plans to give out the smart glasses for free to those who opt to use them. However, Tomay cautioned that the glasses remain experimental and Amazon’s plans for them have not yet been finalized. To make work easier, the online store recently announced the launch of a robotic arm that it said would help warehouse workers pick items from shelves and organize them, thereby speeding up and improving the accuracy of order delivery. Amazon said the Blue Jay robot can reduce injury rates and operate in a more compact space than older robots, which typically require three separate stations. In related events, Amazon’s glasses launch coincides with Samsung’s unveiling of the Galaxy XR . The South Korean multinational manufacturing conglomerate is the latest to take on the category with the Galaxy XR. Samsung began selling it on Tuesday night for $1,800, about half the price of Apple’s Vision Pro. Those who buy the new gadget early will also receive a suite of digital freebies, including free access to the paid version of Google’s Gemini AI assistant and YouTube Premium for a year. The headset was made in collaboration with Google for the software and Qualcomm, which makes the chip powering the Galaxy XR. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Rowe Price moves into crypto with new active ETF plan,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/t-rowe-price-files-for-crypto-etf/,"T. Rowe Price has filed with the SEC to launch a crypto ETF that will allow investors to invest in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The ETF will be an actively managed fund that aims to outperform the FTSE Crypto U.S. Listed Index. If approved, it will trade on the NYSE Arca under a ticker symbol that has yet to be announced. T. Rowe Price moves into crypto with new active ETF plan T. Rowe Price manages $1.77 trillion in assets and has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to create its first Active Crypto Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). The filing states that the fund will hold 5 – 15 different digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), XRP, Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), Avalanche (AVAX), Shiba Inu (SHIB), and Litecoin (LTC). The company said this number may change depending on market conditions. The Active Crypto ETF will only hold “eligible assets” to stay within clear legal boundaries and comply with SEC rules, thereby avoiding the legal issues that have affected other crypto projects in recent years. The fund will also maintain a portion of its assets in cash, stablecoins, or short-term safe investments, such as bank deposits, to ensure it always has sufficient liquid funds for expenses. T. Rowe Price Sponsor LLC will manage the fund’s operations, trading decisions, and long-term strategy. At the same time, CSC Delaware Trust Company will act as the trustee to ensure that its activities comply with the rules. T. Rowe Price Associates will handle accounting, record keeping, and reporting. Another interesting point in the filing is that the fund may include staking in the future if regulators allow it. The ETF could generate additional income for investors and support the network’s operations. However, the company stated that it will only move forward once U.S. regulators provide clear guidance and rules on staking. The Active Crypto ETF will have experts as managers who will monitor price trends, market activity, and long-term growth of each coin to determine the optimal time to buy, sell, or adjust the fund’s position. Rising investor demand pushes major firms to add crypto funds Companies like BlackRock, Fidelity, and Grayscale have launched Bitcoin ETFs , bringing in more than $150 billion in investments in just a few months. The SEC also approved Ethereum ETFs later in the same year, and these attracted $23 billion in assets in just a few months. T. Rowe Price is following the lead of popular financial companies like Fidelity, VanEck, and ProShares, which have also expanded into crypto investments. ProShares, for example, recently filed for its own mixed digital coin fund that will hold several cryptocurrencies instead of just one. The SEC is currently reviewing over 90 applications for different types of crypto ETFs. Some focus on single coins, such as Solana, while others, like the T. Rowe Price proposal, include multiple digital assets in a single fund. Analysts say all these applications prove just how optimistic investors are about the future of crypto regulation in the United States. T. Rowe Price did not make any comments, but this move demonstrates how much financial institutions now view crypto as a genuine investment opportunity.

Notably, stablecoin reserves on leading crypto exchanges like Binance are entering all-time high (ATH) territory, hinting at a potential rally for BTC. Stablecoin Reserves Rise – Will Bitcoin Benefit? According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor PelinayPA, Binance stablecoin reserves are approaching ATH levels, indicating that investors are ready to deploy funds to accumulate BTC at current or lower levels. Related Reading: Bitcoin Enters ‘Disbelief Phase’ – Could Short Sellers Face The Next Squeeze? The CryptoQuant analyst highlighted the rapidly falling Bitcoin-Stablecoin Ratio (ESR). For the uninitiated, the ESR measures the proportion of Bitcoin reserves to stablecoin reserves on exchanges like Binance. The ratio also gives hints about the market’s potential buying power and selling pressure. Past data shows that whenever the ESR falls sharply during market volatility, BTC’s price tends to surge. Essentially, a declining ESR means that stablecoin reserves are growing in comparison to BTC reserves on exchanges. This shows an increase in available “dry powder” on exchanges, which can quickly be used to buy more BTC and initiate another bull rally. Conversely, when the ESR rises, it means that stablecoin reserves are falling while BTC supply on exchanges is increasing. This points toward an increase in short-term selling pressure as traders deposit BTC to exchanges to sell. Currently, the ESR has fallen to historically low levels, implying that Binance holds relatively large stablecoin reserves compared to BTC reserves. According to PelinayPA, such a setup can have two interpretations: In a positive scenario, the abundance of stablecoins suggests significant latent buying power. If market confidence returns, this could trigger a strong wave of buying pressure and mark the start of a new bullish phase. Meanwhile, the negative scenario assumes that this liquidity would remain inactive, reflecting investor hesitation and a market in standby mode after the recent bloodbath that resulted in liquidations worth $19 billion. Will The Gold Rotation Help BTC? Following the crypto market crash earlier this month, which sent BTC from an ATH of more than $126,000 all the way down to $102,000, several whales faced liquidations. Despite the crash, some analysts are confident that the BTC top is not in yet. Related Reading: Bitcoin Whales Are Back: Three Indicators Suggest A Run Toward $130,000 One of the factors that can significantly benefit BTC in the near term is the capital rotation from gold to the digital asset. In a new report, Bitwise predicted that capital rotation from gold into BTC could propel it to $242,000. That said, veteran trader Peter Brandt recently forecasted that BTC could crash 50% from current price levels. At press time, BTC trades at $108,268, down 0.3% in the past 24 hours.

After weeks of volatile price action, the market’s recovery attempts are being met with heavy resistance, with BTC still trading below key psychological levels. According to data from Lookonchain, the well-known trader known as the BitcoinOG (1011short) — famous for shorting the market during the October 10 crash — is once again making headlines. On-chain data shows that the whale has started dumping BTC, triggering renewed anxiety among traders and investors. This move has reignited debate across the community, as many analysts consider this trader part of the so-called “smart money” cohort — entities known for anticipating market shifts with high precision. While some interpret the whale’s activity as a sign of further downside ahead, others argue that such events often mark capitulation points where the market absorbs final waves of selling before rebounding. With uncertainty rising and liquidity thin, Bitcoin’s next moves will be crucial in determining short-term sentiment. The coming days could decide whether this whale’s actions confirm another leg down — or signal the last shakeout before a broader recovery phase. Whale Activity Intensifies: The BitcoinOG Moves Millions Across Exchanges According to Lookonchain insights , the BitcoinOG (1011short) — the trader who famously shorted the market during the October 10 crash — is once again making major moves. Since the market downturn, this whale has deposited 5,252 BTC, worth approximately $587.88 million, into major exchanges including Binance, Coinbase, and Hyperliquid. At the same time, data shows his short position on Hyperliquid has grown to 2,100 BTC, valued at around $227.8 million. This scale of activity has drawn intense attention from analysts, given the trader’s historical accuracy in predicting market tops. Depositing Bitcoin to exchanges often signals potential selling or hedging behavior, adding to the bearish tone currently dominating sentiment. Combined with the expansion of his short exposure, it suggests the whale could be positioning for further downside or protecting gains from earlier market moves. However, several experts have urged caution in overinterpreting these transactions. On-chain visibility only provides a partial view — these may be just a fraction of the whale’s total holdings or broader strategy. It’s possible that some positions remain hidden across other derivatives platforms, wallets, or over-the-counter deals. This uncertainty makes the whale’s behavior both intriguing and concerning. While retail traders often react strongly to such visible movements, seasoned analysts emphasize the need for broader context — including derivatives data, funding rates, and liquidity shifts. Weekly Chart: Support Retest as Market Faces Key Inflection Point The weekly Bitcoin chart shows the market struggling to hold above the $108,000 region, a critical short-term support level that aligns closely with the 50-week moving average (blue line). After the sharp drop following the October 10 crash, BTC attempted a rebound but failed to sustain momentum above $114,000, signaling persistent selling pressure near the $117,500 resistance — a level that has acted as both support and resistance multiple times over the past year. The structure now suggests Bitcoin is in a consolidation phase within a broader bullish trend, but downside risks remain elevated. If the 50-week moving average fails to hold, the next potential support lies near $100,000, which aligns with the lower range of historical demand and the March 2025 breakout zone. A break below this region could accelerate selling momentum and confirm a deeper retracement. Conversely, reclaiming $117,500 would signal renewed strength, opening the door for a potential retest of the $125,000–$130,000 range. Overall, Bitcoin’s weekly structure remains cautiously bullish, but sustained weakness around current levels would put the broader uptrend at risk — making the coming weeks decisive for long-term direction.

The conversation began after developer Vincent Van Code suggested that Ripple’s primary objective has always been tied to the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and its native token, rather than to side ventures such as stablecoins or cross-border payment products. When will everyone just accept that Ripple endgame has ALWAYS been XRPL and XRP. Not stablecoins, not cross border, just establishing a global liquidity on chain, using XRP, #TheLiquidityTokenXRP — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) October 20, 2025 Analysts Argue Ripple’s Strategy Relies on XRP Growth According to Van Code, the company’s broader vision is to establish global on-chain liquidity powered by the XRPL, positioning XRP as the foundation for large-scale financial transactions. His comments reignited a long-standing belief among some investors that Ripple’s business model is directly dependent on XRP’s valuation. XRP proponent Digital Asset Investor reinforced this view, stating that the company’s success is inseparable from the eventual appreciation of XRP. While Ripple has consistently avoided making public projections about the token’s price, he argued that its financial structure leaves little doubt about the importance of a stronger XRP market. Ripple’s reticence on price-related discussions is widely interpreted as a regulatory safeguard, particularly given its history of legal disputes with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, the firm’s substantial XRP holdings, about 35 billion in escrow and an additional 5.01 billion readily available, clearly tie its financial health to the token’s value. At the current trading price of roughly $2.40 , every $1 increase would theoretically add around $40 billion to Ripple’s balance sheet. Community Divided Over Ripple’s Direction Despite these perspectives, not everyone within the XRP ecosystem agrees that Ripple’s strategy revolves around XRP’s price. Some critics argue that recent decisions contradict the company’s stated commitment to its own blockchain. For instance, a well-known community member, Fishy Catfish, questioned why Ripple issued nearly 90% of its RLUSD stablecoin supply on Ethereum rather than the XRPL. Data from CryptoQuant supports this observation. It shows that only 92.5 million RLUSD reside on the XRPL, while the total supply nears 900 million. The move has led some to interpret Ripple’s strategy as a vote of no confidence in its native network. “Not even Ripple wants to use XRP or XRPL,” Catfish remarked, describing the chain as outdated and underused. Meanwhile, other users maintain that XRP has always been intended as a bridge asset for cross-border liquidity solutions, a mission Ripple has championed since its inception. They question whether the company’s new initiatives signal a shift away from that original focus. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Ripple’s Quiet Endgame Still Centers on XRP Despite internal disagreements, market observers highlight Ripple’s continuous efforts to integrate XRP into institutional systems. Ongoing partnerships with firms such as GTreasury , Evernorth , and Japan’s SBI Holdings illustrate that the company is still expanding practical use cases for the token. In addition, Ripple is reportedly supporting initiatives to establish a major public XRP treasury , a long-term accumulation strategy designed to mirror how other firms have driven value appreciation through controlled supply growth. Although Ripple avoids explicitly connecting its success to XRP’s price movements, most analysts agree that the two remain closely aligned. As the company deepens its presence in institutional finance and continues to build liquidity infrastructure around the XRPL, community members see growing evidence that the company’s ultimate objective is inseparable from the value of XRP itself.

Bitcoin leads the rebound, joined by altcoins like XRP , Cardano (ADA) , Chainlink (LINK) — and MAGACOIN FINANCE , now drawing whale attention as buyers prepare for a major Q4 rally. Bitcoin Bounces Back After $19B Crash After a record $19 billion liquidation on October 10, Bitcoin’s drop to $104,000 caught many off guard. But Standard Chartered’s Geoff Kendrick now says the shakeout may have cleared the path for a major rally. He believes Bitcoin could rise to $200,000 by year-end if ETF inflows keep growing and the U.S. Federal Reserve continues easing rates. Kendrick told Cointelegraph that even in a weaker market case, Bitcoin could close “well north of $150,000” before December ends. He added that ETF inflows are already recovering, with $477 million in net positives this week alone, signaling renewed demand from institutional players. This bounce marks what many traders see as a second accumulation phase. With gold also reaching new highs, Bitcoin is regaining its safe-haven appeal. Many analysts now list it as the best crypto to buy for November , especially for those seeking a rebound play after the crash. XRP Price Outlook Turns Up After Sharp Drop XRP’s recent price drop hit harder than most. During the October 10 flash crash, XRP fell as low as $0.77 on Binance , marking a 72% daily plunge. But some analysts now think this correction could set the stage for a strong recovery. Crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo told his 700,000 followers on X that XRP’s setup looks similar to late 2017, when a flash crash on Binance preceded its legendary run to $3.3. He believes XRP “could send from here,” noting how the coin bounced from a long-term descending trendline. XRP currently trades under $2.5 but continues to attract attention from retail buyers and whales waiting for a clean breakout. With renewed buying pressure and historic patterns aligning, many are placing XRP among the best crypto to buy for November , expecting it to mirror previous recovery cycles. Cardano Shows Signs of a 333% Rebound Cardano (ADA) remains in focus for long-term investors. Despite price drops since early October, analysts see a clear uptrend forming. Market watcher Javon Marks said ADA has kept its breakout structure intact, which could pave the way for another large rally. Marks projects a 333% rally to $2.96 , noting that ADA has consistently made higher highs and higher lows since 2023. Even its recent dip to $0.279 didn’t break key levels. Other analysts like Chris O forecast a run to as high as $5–$8 this cycle if sentiment strengthens. Cardano’s stability amid market turbulence gives it an edge for recovery portfolios. Its consistent development and committed user base make ADA one of the best crypto picks for November , especially for those diversifying beyond Bitcoin and XRP. Chainlink Positioned for Institutional Growth Chainlink (LINK) trades around $17.52 after a brief pullback, but institutional activity hints at bigger moves ahead. Grayscale and Bitwise have filed to launch Chainlink ETFs on NYSE Arca — a move that could open new channels for traditional investors to enter the asset. Whales also remain active around the $16 price zone, buying more than 54 million LINK tokens in October. This buying zone may act as a base for the next run, especially with exchange reserves falling by 33 million LINK since July. Chainlink continues to lead in real-world asset (RWA) integration, working with S&P Global, SWIFT, and ICE. Its growing relevance in decentralized data systems keeps it among the best crypto to buy for November for those seeking steady, utility-driven growth. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Whale Interest Surges Before Q4 Breakout As traders rotate capital into new altcoins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching attention. Over 21,000 new investors joined after the team confirmed listings on both a major DEX and CEX. Market watchers say whales are quietly building positions under $0.0006 , expecting what could become the biggest Q4 breakout among low-cost coins. Imagine holding before a surge to $0.1 — that’s a 1000x gain from today’s price. Many see it as a way to diversify from top caps while still capturing big upside. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE? Whale entries ahead of listings Early-stage altcoin under $0.0006 Transparent, community-driven model With buzz growing, MAGACOIN FINANCE joins Bitcoin, XRP, ADA, and LINK among the best crypto to buy for November . How Traders Can Position Now Traders are shifting from panic to preparation. The October crash created fresh entry zones for top coins. Those diversifying into upcoming names like MAGACOIN FINANCE could be early in the next breakout wave.

Source: SHIBUSD on Tradingview Shiba Inu Investor Confidence Remains Strong as Wallet Count Grows The rise in holders, though modest, reflects continued confidence in Shiba Inu’s long-term prospects. On-chain analyst Etherscan_SHIB described the trend as “strong momentum,” noting that new investors continue entering the ecosystem even amid volatility. Currently, Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades near $0.00000985 with a market capitalization of about $5.86 billion, down over 47% year-over-year. Nonetheless, the community’s ability to expand during a bearish cycle underscores the meme coin’s enduring cultural and retail appeal. Exchange Inflows Raise Short-Term Concerns Despite strong community participation, short-term risks remain elevated. Data from CryptoQuant revealed that Shiba Inu exchange reserves rose by over 56.6 billion SHIB within 24 hours, suggesting increased selling intent. The movement of tokens from self-custody to exchanges typically signals short-term profit-taking or fear of further downside. Analysts also point to a descending triangle formation on SHIB’s chart, a bearish technical pattern that often precedes breakdowns. The base support around $0.00001052 has been tested multiple times since April, and a confirmed breach could push prices toward $0.000006. Nevertheless, Shiba Inu’s ability to avoid “adding another zero” to its price this week has been celebrated as a small but meaningful psychological victory for holders. Can Token Burns and Shibarium Drive the 2025 Rebound? Analysts remain divided on whether SHIB can mount a strong comeback in 2025. Optimists cite the growing Shibarium layer-2 adoption and an active token burn mechanism as potential catalysts for a long-term rebound. These mechanisms aim to reduce SHIB’s massive 589 trillion supply, which critics argue is the biggest barrier to significant price appreciation. Bullish forecasts suggest that if burns accelerate and network utility grows, SHIB could retest $0.000025–$0.00005 in a favorable 2025 market. However, others warn that sustained gains will depend on Shiba Inu delivering on its DeFi, metaverse, and NFT marketplace promises.

53523291,611625,1761188441,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/53523291.jpeg,Ethereum Will Impose Gas Limit In Fusaka Upgrade,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-gas-limit-fusaka-upgrade/,"The Ethereum Foundation has confirmed that the upcoming Fusaka hard fork will introduce a protocol-level ceiling on how much gas a single transaction may consume, formally codified as EIP-7825. The cap is set at 2²⁴ gas—16,777,216 units—marking the first time Ethereum enforces a per-transaction limit distinct from the block gas limit. The change is already active on Holesky and Sepolia and will go live on mainnet when Fusaka activates . In a post published October 21, Toni Wahrstätter framed the rationale in direct terms: “Starting with the upcoming Fusaka hard fork, EIP-7825 introduces a per-transaction gas limit cap of 2²⁴ (≈ 16.78 million gas).” The Foundation’s note emphasizes that while the cap bounds individual transactions, it does not alter the block gas limit; instead, it is designed to mitigate denial-of-service vectors where a single oversized call monopolizes an entire block and to improve block packing predictability as the network prepares for parallel execution. EIP-7825 draws a clean line between transaction-level complexity and system-level throughput. Previously, exceptionally large calls could approach the full block gas target (around 45 million at times), creating timing and scheduling pathologies for builders and validators. The new ceiling obliges workloads that would exceed 16.78 million gas to be broken into smaller, sequenced calls. The Foundation’s guidance is careful to note that “for most users, nothing changes,” since the statistical distribution of real-world transactions already sits well below the threshold; the risk surface primarily concerns batch-heavy contracts, deployment scripts, and specialized routers. What This Means For Ethereum And Users From a roadmap perspective, the cap is explicitly positioned as groundwork for parallel execution. The blog post connects the change to anticipated efforts such as EIP-7928 in the “Glamsterdam” era, where predictable, bounded transactions are a prerequisite for meaningful concurrency in the execution layer. By ensuring that at least several independent transactions can be packed per block—even under pathological mempool conditions—the cap reduces worst-case contention and simplifies scheduler design for builders experimenting with parallelizable execution paths. The specification itself is spare and mechanical. EIP-7825’s abstract states the intent “to 16,777,216 (2^24) gas” per transaction, improving resilience against certain DoS vectors and making transaction processing more predictable as block limits rise. That simplicity has been part of its appeal in core-dev channels: a small, well-scoped constraint that preserves forward compatibility with more ambitious scaling work. Debate on how to encode and communicate the ceiling has been active for months, including discussions over naming and parameterization on Ethereum Magicians and during AllCoreDevs calls. One thread summarized the core guarantee being targeted by several contributors: aligning block targets to multiples of 2²⁴ so builders can always include at least n transactions if the mempool has n eligible ones—an argument for predictability rather than raw throughput. Operationally, the Foundation says all major clients —Geth, Erigon, Reth, Nethermind, and Besu—have implemented the change in Fusaka-ready releases, reducing cross-client divergence risk at activation. The post also stresses that eth_call semantics are unaffected and that pre-signed transactions whose gas limits exceed 2²⁴ will need to be re-signed below the cap. The upgrade path for developers is straightforward: test against Holesky or Sepolia, re-tool batch operations that flirt with the limit, and adjust gas-estimation logic and alerts so they fail fast when constructions exceed the new ceiling. The policy context is worth parsing. Ethereum’s history has favored minimal, general-purpose constraints, deferring complexity to higher layers. EIP-7825 fits that pattern: it does not opine on what contracts should do, only that they respect an upper bound that protects liveness and prepares the execution layer for a multi-threaded future. It also sidesteps fee-market alterations and leaves blob-space economics and block targets to other EIPs and forks. As the Foundation put it, the cap “establishes a safer and more predictable foundation for higher throughput in future forks ,” a line that sums up the trade-off succinctly. At press time, ETH traded at $3,835.",Ethereum|EIP-7825|ETH|ETH news|Ether|Ethereum Fusaka|ethereum news,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 03:00:41
53521721,https://timestabloid.com/?p=87292,1761188553,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst: Ripple Could Acquire Chris Larsen’s 2.5 Billion XRP Holdings. Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-ripple-could-acquire-chris-larsens-2-5-billion-xrp-holdings-heres-why/,"A growing discussion within the XRP community has centered on the vast XRP holdings of Ripple’s co-founder and executive chairman, Chris Larsen. The speculation began after a market observer known as XRP Liquidity suggested that Ripple might eventually purchase Larsen’s remaining tokens, which amount to roughly 2.5 billion XRP. The analyst’s comments follow Evernorth’s recent initiative to create the world’s largest XRP treasury , a project that has drawn attention from several prominent institutional investors. Evernorth aims to raise $1 billion worth of XRP for this effort, marking the first large-scale treasury program of its kind. My guess is Ripple is or will be buying Larsens remaining 2.5B XRP. Expect alot more of Larsen off loading if true. Especially, if all 2.5B is off loaded. Same with Britto. At $200 XRP price Larsens 2.5B XRP would be worth 500B dollars. They will not let him have that. https://t.co/YdvbBz0q6B — XRP_Liquidity (Larsen/Britto/Escrow/ODL/RLUSD) (@XRPwallets) October 21, 2025 Evernorth’s XRP Treasury and Larsen’s Contribution Times Tabloid recently reported that the Japanese financial powerhouse SBI Holdings is among the firms backing Evernorth’s plan, having pledged $200 million. Ripple itself is expected to contribute around $300 million, while additional investors have committed a combined $645 million. As part of his personal involvement, Chris Larsen donated 50 million XRP, valued at approximately $120 million, to the initiative. The transaction, which took place on October 20 from one of his wallets identified as “chrislarsen2,” was initially mistaken by some market participants as a potential selloff. However, later clarifications confirmed that the transfer represented his contribution to Evernorth’s fundraising campaign rather than a liquidation event. Following this transaction, Larsen’s personal XRP balance stands at roughly 2.5 billion tokens. These holdings trace back to the early days of the XRP Ledger (XRPL), when he and other co-founders received large token allocations after the network’s creation more than a decade ago. Could Ripple Acquire Larsen’s Holdings? The suggestion that Ripple might purchase Larsen’s XRP stems from the company’s interest in maintaining market stability and preventing future large-scale liquidations. XRP Liquidity argued that while Larsen remains affiliated with Ripple, his personal control over billions of tokens presents a potential market imbalance that the company could eventually seek to address. Observers have compared the situation to that of Jed McCaleb, another Ripple co-founder who sold his entire XRP holdings on the open market after parting ways with the company. McCaleb’s sales, which took nearly eight years to complete, often exerted selling pressure on the asset’s price during that period. The same analyst also highlighted that Ripple might consider acquiring the XRP owned by Arthur Britto, another co-founder who remains largely out of the public eye. Data from XRPScan indicates that Britto holds about 1.3 billion XRP, currently valued at over $3 billion. In contrast, Larsen’s remaining holdings are worth around $6 billion at current prices. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Potential Implications for Ripple and the Market Larsen’s XRP balance places him among the wealthiest individuals in the crypto space, with a net worth comparable to prominent billionaires such as Mark Cuban. The scale of his holdings has fueled speculation about what could happen if XRP’s price were to rise significantly. According to XRP Liquidity , a hypothetical scenario in which XRP reaches $200 per token would push Larsen’s wealth to an estimated $500 billion, a figure that could create serious concentration concerns within the ecosystem. The analyst suggested that Ripple may prefer to manage this by purchasing or redistributing some of those holdings, though there is no evidence that the company has such plans at this time. At present, the idea remains purely speculative. Neither Ripple nor Larsen has indicated any intention to initiate a buyback or transfer arrangement. Still, the discussion highlights the influence of large individual holders on XRP’s long-term market dynamics and the company’s ongoing efforts to balance decentralization with financial stability.

It has captured my attention with the recent announcement that they own 2.7% of ETH supply. BMNR is a speculative venture, with a steep premium between its ETH and market cap, but it also has the backing of some famous investors with deep pockets. ETH is itself a speculative vehicle, and so adding corporate leverage to it, like the 50M shares BMNR created to buy ETH with, ratchets up the risks to crypto. Corporate leverage also ratchets up the reward, as we've seen with MSTR and Bitcoin. BMNR aims to be the MSTR of Ethereum. Currently, BMNR is sitting on $1B in unrealized losses, although this may be temporary based on where Ethereum goes from here. Regular readers of mine will know that I have a fixation on cryptocurrency treasury companies, or firms that hold crypto like Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ), Ethereum ( ETH-USD ), and Solana ( SOL-USD ) on their balance sheets instead of US Dollars. I've covered a few of these firms, as well as an ETF that holds the convertible bonds issued by these firms, and so little surprises me now when I see charts like today's focus, Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Inc. (BMNR). The market just can't get enough of crypto treasury companies, it seems. Here's the YTD, including the massive spike in July when they made the shift from being solely a Bitcoin mining operation to an Ethereum treasury company. Data by YCharts Other shifts, such as adding famous investor Tom Lee (Fundstrat and the GRNY ETF) as chairman and the news of Peter Thiel ( PYPL and PLTR notoriety, among others) taking a 9% stake in the firm, have also supercharged its stock. Since that spike in July died down (condolences to those who bought at the top), the firm has still had significant volatility. Here's a zoomed-in look since August, essentially excluding the announcements that drove the stock. I'll map ETH against it, too, to show how the firm's price is now tied to its treasury holding. Data by YCharts Note that sometimes charts can be deceiving. Mapped like that, with two different Y-axes, the correlation is visible, but the difference in returns is obscured. Here's the normalized chart so you can see how volatile BMNR is compared to ETH. Data by YCharts The Anatomy of an ETH Treasury Company One thing to consider is that investors track how much Ethereum BMNR owns and how much it is worth. That dramatically influences their stock price, especially because most of the treasury holdings are bought with debt and stock issuance, providing inherent leverage. In BMNR's case, most of their financing has been done through share issuance, heavily diluting the pool. Six months ago (pre-treasury announcement), there were fewer than 2M shares, and now there are over 50M. Data by YCharts For the record, this kind of jump is not normal. In fact, most large corporations do the opposite and buy back shares from the market. The idea here is not to dilute shareholders out of their value, although that is what happens when new shares are issued en masse, but to generate enough cash to build an Ethereum position worth investing in after the dilution. This dynamic creates a situation where the company is valued partially on its ETH holdings and partially on its ability to continue amassing ETH. The wider this divergence, the more risk there is to investors. As of Oct. 21st (time of writing), the BMNR's treasury was worth $12.4B and its market cap was $16.5B. Here is the last month of fluctuations between the two figures: Moonfarm The timing of the buys from BMNR is important too because investors are relying on the corporate operations to provide value. This is one way they can easily and cheaply raise BMNR's value, getting good deals on ETH purchases. We can track these purchases, going back the last three months since the announcement, to see how BMNR is doing. It's also helpful to see when their USD holdings change. If they get too low, expect more share dilution or debt issuance. Moonfarm ETH's price has been falling in the last few days, and so BMNR is currently underwater on their ETH purchases. This may be temporary, and your view of that will depend on your opinions on ETH. If the price recovers, these unrealized losses will turn to unrealized gains and boost BMNR's stock price. Moonfarm Controlling Ethereum Because cryptocurrency networks are democratic machines with your votes tied to your assets, it is in the best interest of whales to stay that way and to accumulate more and more of the network so that they have an outsized effect. To this end, BMNR has been keeping tabs on how much of the ETH supply they own, which is now at 2.7% of currently issued tokens . Their goal is 5% of supply, which they call the ""Alchemy of 5%"" (0:3:18). With this power, treasury corps will increasingly have more and more say about what happens with the blockchain. BMNR believes that they are really a ""crypto infrastructure company,"" and their building out of validators for the ETH network is proof of this. It will also help them build a larger stake in ETH, as they will earn rewards for participating in the network. I can't say for certain if this strategy will bear fruit, mostly because it depends on the price of Ethereum, which is a very speculative endeavor. This is more and more true the shorter the timeframe you have, and so it stands to reason that investors should be very concerned with the risks of this plan panning out. Conclusion Ultimately, I am skeptical of folks calling BMNR the ""Strategy ( MSTR ) of Ethereum,"" but I get the comparison on some levels. Both firms have risen to the top of their respective cryptocurrencies in terms of how much they hold and have become whales in the space. This firm is very risky, and investors could easily lose their shirt on it if they buy in at the wrong time—valuation-wise, at least; see the 3000% spike and then 75% crash. I split the jump and crash into two charts to make this point: Data by YCharts Data by YCharts Investors going into this stock moving forward need to understand that this is an aggressive position, even more so than holding cryptocurrency outright. Volatility isn't always a bad thing, as shown in BMNR's outperformance of ETH itself, just like how MSTR has outperformed BTC. The corporate leverage adds risk, but also reward. That reward hinges on something that BMNR has little control of: the price of Ethereum. There are a lot of considerations, and the most important from my view is position size. Those wanting to hold this firm should deeply consider their sizing and its impact on their portfolio if ETH were to experience one of its infamous nose-dive crashes . Investors who believe ETH will outperform BTC moving forward will likely prefer BMNR to MSTR for the same reason.

Musk stayed silent on several pressing issues during the call. He did not address vehicle demand after an important federal tax credit ended last month. The Cybertruck went unmentioned. He said nothing about how tariffs on auto parts affect the business. Investors received no guidance on what to expect in the fourth quarter. The earnings themselves disappointed Wall Street, missing analyst predictions. But Musk chose to discuss his long-term plans rather than current sales figures and profit margins. “People just don’t don’t quite appreciate the degree to which this will take off, where it’s honestly, it’s going to be like a shock wave,” Musk said at the start of the call as mentioned in CNBC report. “We have millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars and, you know, we’re making a couple million a year.” div]:bg-bg-000/50 [&_pre>div]:border-0.5 [&_pre>div]:border-border-400 [&_.ignore-pre-bg>div]:bg-transparent [&_.standard-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pl-2 [&_.standard-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,ul,ol,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pr-8 [&_.progressive-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pl-2 [&_.progressive-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,ul,ol,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pr-8""> _*]:min-w-0 standard-markdown""> For many years, Elon Musk has pledged that Tesla car owners would be able to generate income by allowing their vehicles to operate as driverless taxis. Yet rival companies are making faster progress in this space. Waymo, owned by Alphabet, is broadening its paying robotaxi operations to additional cities, while Baidu’s Apollo Go service is expanding across China and beyond. Meanwhile, Tesla continues to be limited to limited-scale pilot initiatives. Robotaxi plans lag behind promises Back in July, Musk predicted Tesla would offer autonomous rides to “probably half the population of The U.S. by the end of the year.” The company still does not make or sell cars safe enough to operate without someone ready to take control. On Wednesday, Musk said Tesla plans to launch its driverless robotaxi service in Austin before the year ends. He added that the service would reach eight to 10 cities by the end of 2025, though those would have drivers on board. Finance chief Vaibhav Taneja revealed that “is still small” for FSD Supervised, Tesla’s driver-assistance system. Only 12% of users actually pay for it. Taneja did not share what customers pay on average after Tesla ran multiple promotions to boost sales. The company’s investor presentation showed FSD revenue fell below the $326 million reported a year earlier. That means FSD brought in less than 2% of total revenue this past quarter. After discussing robotaxis, Musk moved to humanoid robots. He repeated his claim that Optimus has the “potential to be the biggest product of all time.” Optimus is a two-legged robot Tesla is developing but has not released for commercial use. Musk previously said these robots could work in factories or watch children. He went further on Wednesday. “Optimus will be an incredible surgeon,” Musk said. He claimed that with Optimus and self-driving cars, “you can actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care.” Musk said Tesla would likely show off a new version called V3 in the first quarter of 2026. Pay package fight intensifies At the call’s conclusion, Musk connected robots to his compensation. Tesla introduced a new pay plan in September that could reach $1 trillion and give Musk 12% more ownership. Shareholders will vote on this plan at the annual meeting in early November. “If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?” Musk asked. “I don’t feel comfortable building that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.” He also attacked proxy advisors Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis after they told shareholders to reject his pay plan. Musk said the firms “have no freaking clue” and called them “corporate terrorists.” Neither firm responded immediately. The call did not cover anything Tesla might do soon to win back customers. Tesla’s brand ranking dropped to 25th place on the Interbrand 2025 Best Global Brands list from 12th in 2024.

As Solana reclaims center stage, a new wave of contenders is rising fast. Aster is gaining traction with its scalable DeFi ecosystem, while BullZilla ($BZIL) is turning heads as the market’s next potential 100x crypto. Together, Solana, Aster, and BullZilla are reshaping how investors view blockchain dominance in 2025, and the race is only just beginning. While Solana captures headlines with ETF momentum and Aster surges through multi-chain expansion, BullZilla is roaring ahead with one of the most explosive presales of the year. Its innovative tokenomics, 24-stage burn mechanism, and surging community growth are transforming early backers into long-term believers chasing massive gains. With unstoppable presale demand and a dynamic price structure, BullZilla is fast emerging as one of the top cryptos to join this week poised to outshine even Solana’s rally. BullZilla ($BZIL): The Explosive Presale Leading Top Cryptos to Join This Week BullZilla ($BZIL) is rewriting presale history as one of the top cryptos to join this week . Currently in Stage 7 (Bag Signal Activated, Phase C), the project has raised over $950,000, sold 31 billion tokens, and gained 3,100+ holders. The presale price stands at $0.00017907, with a +3.72% increase projected within seven days. BullZilla’s Progressive Price Engine automatically raises prices every 48 hours or after $100,000 is raised, creating constant scarcity and incentivizing early entry. Its 24-stage burn architecture and 70% APY HODL Furnace reward loyal investors who stake tokens long-term. Built on Ethereum, its security and transparency align with EEAT standards, making it a top presale. ROI Projection: $2,000 in BullZilla Today Could Explode to $54,800 A $2,000 investment at $0.00017907 secures 11.17 million $BZIL tokens. Once BullZilla lists at $0.00527, this investment would be worth $54,800, delivering an ROI of 2,843.77%. Early joiners from Stage 7C enjoy an even higher ROI of 3,014.26%, underscoring the benefits of timing. BullZilla’s scarcity mechanics, combining automatic burns, vault rewards, and staged price progression, make it a living ecosystem where each milestone strengthens token value. This presale isn’t just hype; it’s a structured pathway toward real deflationary growth. Your Last Shot: $0.00017907 BullZilla Tokens Before the Next Big Jump How to Join the BullZilla Presale Getting started with BullZilla is seamless. First, set up a Web3 wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Purchase ETH through a reliable exchange like Binance or Coinbase, then transfer it to your wallet. Visit the official BullZilla presale site, connect your wallet, and swap ETH for $BZIL tokens. Your purchase will lock automatically, and tokens can be claimed after the presale concludes. Vesting and claim timelines are visible directly on the presale dashboard for complete transparency. Solana: ETF Approval and Ecosystem Expansion Fuel Momentum Solana remains a titan in smart contract innovation, proving its resilience even amid a volatile market. As Bitcoin stumbled below $108,000 with ETF outflows crossing $1.2 billion, Solana quietly achieved a milestone: Hong Kong launched the world’s first Solana ETF under ChinaAMC (HK). This event positioned Solana as the second major blockchain to achieve spot ETF status, boosting credibility among institutions. Despite a temporary 7% dip to $184, Solana’s fundamentals remain solid. Its ecosystem thrives with Uniswap adding SOL trading pairs, Gemini launching a Solana Card offering 6.77% auto-staking rewards, and Jito Foundation securing $50 million from a16z. Even with a 19% drop in DEX volume, Solana’s $11.06 billion TVL and leadership in daily DApp revenue confirm its dominance as one of the most efficient Layer-1 chains in the market. Aster: Multi-Chain Innovation Gains Institutional Confidence Aster ($ASTER) has become the quiet disruptor in 2025’s blockchain conversation. The token rose 4.98% to $1.21 with trading volume surpassing $643 million in just 24 hours. Its cross-chain interoperability model, linking Ethereum, Polkadot, and other major ecosystems, has drawn heavy developer migration from legacy networks. Institutional players are also paying attention. The Aster Foundation’s sustainability initiatives and enterprise-grade partnerships are positioning it as a stable long-term play. The network’s expansion across DeFi and gaming continues to generate consistent revenue, creating a steady demand curve. Analysts forecast that Aster could outperform several mid-cap rivals as it scales its validator network. For investors looking beyond volatility, Aster provides the perfect balance between innovation and institutional trust, making it one of the best cryptos to buy this week for sustained growth. Conclusion: Solana and Aster Show Strength, but BullZilla Defines Opportunity Solana and Aster exemplify how blockchain maturity drives steady growth, yet BullZilla proves that innovation plus timing creates exponential potential. Only BullZilla’s presale among the top cryptos to join this week offers investors a quantifiable path to multi-fold returns within a structured ecosystem. As presale stages shift every 48 hours or once $100,000 is raised, early participation remains the key to unlocking maximum upside. With community expansion, Ethereum-backed stability, and a transparent roadmap, BullZilla is shaping up to lead the next bull cycle, not just as a meme coin, but as a statement of financial evolution.

The Network Value to Transactions (NVT) Ratio is an on-chain indicator that measures the ratio between BTC’s market cap and transaction volume. Related Reading: Bitcoin Newbie Whales Now Sitting On $6.9 Billion In Losses, Most Since 2023 When the value of this metric is high, it means the value of the network (as represented by the market cap) is high compared to its ability to transact coins (the volume). Such a trend can be a sign that the asset may be overvalued. On the other hand, the indicator having a low value can imply the cryptocurrency’s price could have room to grow as its market cap isn’t inflated against its transaction volume. In the context of the current discussion, a modified form of the NVT Ratio called the NVT Golden Cross is the indicator of interest. This metric is a Bollinger-band-like signaling indicator that compares the short-term trend of the NVT Ratio (10-day moving average) against its long-term trend (30-day MA) to determine whether the indicator is near a top or bottom. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 30-day exponential moving average (EMA) of the Bitcoin NVT Ratio over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day EMA Bitcoin NVT Golden Cross currently has a value of around zero, which suggests the market is in a neutral phase according to the NVT Ratio. In the chart, the quant has highlighted the zones where tops and bottoms have historically tended to occur. It would appear that a highly positive value generally signals some sort of top for BTC, while a negative one can lead to a bottom. Related Reading: Chainlink To $100? Analyst Says This Breakout Could Be The Trigger In the current cycle so far, the indicator hasn’t seen any spike into the red zone. Whether this means that this bull market is an exception, or that Bitcoin is yet to reach its top, only remains to be seen. While Bitcoin market conditions are neutral from the perspective of the NVT Golden Cross, CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index is painting a different picture. As the analytics firm’s community analyst has noted in an X post, this indicator, which combines the data of several key on-chain metrics, is flashing a bear signal for the asset. BTC Price Bitcoin surged toward $114,000 on Tuesday, but it would appear that the recovery was only short-lived as the coin is already back at $108,000.

They filed a formal notice of appeal on Monday and are expected to file the full appeal papers soon. Diddy: Legal Outcome And Sentence According to court filings and public records, a jury convicted Combs on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution , while clearing him on two other charges, sex trafficking and racketeering. Judge Arun Subramanian imposed a 50-month prison term, a $500,000 fine, and five years of probation. At sentencing, the judge said a substantial term was needed so that abuse of women “is met with real accountability.” Combs had asked for a 14-month sentence so time already spent in custody would lead to a quick release. Prosecutors had pushed for more than 11 years. At the hearing, Combs told the judge, “My actions were disgusting, shameful, and sick.” He said he got “lost in excess” and asked for mercy while apologizing to two women who testified against him. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs has filed a notice of appeal in his federal criminal case following his conviction and sentencing in New York. The legal move indicates he is challenging the court… https://t.co/kztoafXP5A #Diddy #LegalNews #FederalCourt — TC (@tc0888) October 21, 2025 Jury Findings And Trial Details Reports have disclosed that Combs was arrested in September 2024. His trial ran for nearly two-months this summer and drew widespread coverage. Witnesses described encounters that prosecutors said showed Combs used his influence in the music industry to pressure people into sexual situations. One witness, Cassandra Ventura, said she was physically abused and coerced into encounters described in court as “hotel nights.” Another witness who testified under the name Jane said she felt pressured even when she was unwell. The jury’s split verdict — guilty on the transportation counts but not guilty on sex trafficking and racketeering — leaves open legal and factual fights that the defense is likely to press on appeal. Jail Proximity And Public Interest Another angle that attracted attention was Combs’s placement at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he was housed in the same unit as Sam Bankman-Fried, the former crypto executive convicted in the FTX case. Sources say the two men shared dormitory-style housing and had some informal interactions. There is no public evidence linking Combs to the financial crimes at the center of Bankman-Fried’s conviction, and officials have not tied the two cases together. Tech And Crypto Connections Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs has taken part in several tech and crypto-adjacent moves in recent years. He was listed among investors in the banking app ECO, which raised roughly $26 million. He joined a funding round for a hologram and virtual-communications company that was about $12 million. Disclosure documents from June 2023 tied funds linked to Combs to a stake in X Corp. A celebrity-linked “DIDDY” meme token briefly reached a market cap near $180 million during news cycles, though links between Combs and that token remain unclear.

BTC could rise further if there is a clear move above the $109,500 barrier. Bitcoin started a fresh recovery wave above the $108,000 resistance level. The price is trading below $109,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $108,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair might continue to move up if it trades above the $109,500 zone. Bitcoin Price Takes Hit Bitcoin price declined again below the $109,500 level. BTC tested the $106,750 zone and is currently consolidating losses . A low was formed at $106,717 before the price recovered some losses. There was a move above the $107,500 and $108,000 levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $114,000 swing high to the $106,717 low. However, the bulls are now facing many hurdles. Bitcoin is now trading below $109,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $108,800 level. There is also a short-term declining channel forming with resistance at $108,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The first key resistance is near the $109,500 level. The next resistance could be $110,500 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $114,000 swing high to the $106,717 low. A close above the $110,500 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $111,500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $112,000 level. The next barrier for the bulls could be $113,500. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $109,500 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Immediate support is near the $107,200 level. The first major support is near the $106,750 level. The next support is now near the $105,800 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $105,000 support in the near term.

Many investors believe the SEC will resume its ETF reviews once the government shutdown is over. This renewed focus on regulation is boosting confidence and prompting traders to start positioning themselves for the next potential rally. Ethereum and Solana have been classified as the best crypto to buy before the next bull cycle . Both projects are experiencing high momentum with technological upgrades and increased institutional interest. MAGACOIN FINANCE has been identified among the standout projects gaining momentum and with growth potential due to its consistent growth and distinct model. XRP ETF Momentum Sparks Market Rotation The renewed market energy is because of the ongoing XRP ETF discussions. Several ETF decisions were suspended by the SEC when the government shut down. Analysts are anticipating prompt actions when the operations resume. The XRP ETF approvals may hasten the next stage in regulated crypto investment. Polymarket data shows a 99% probability that XRP ETF would be approved ahead of the next market cycle. Bloomberg’s Eric Balchunas referred to the delay as a minor pause, while Nate Geraci pointed to the growing institutional demand for crypto exposure. On October 22, Ripple, Coinbase, and several U.S. Senators participated in a key policy roundtable that could play a pivotal role in shaping ETF regulations for digital assets. The growing excitement over the ETF has sparked renewed interest in major altcoins. As market liquidity picks up, investors looking for huge gains are shifting their attention towards Ethereum and Solana. Ethereum Strengthens Ahead of Next Bull Cycle Ethereum is in its final testing phase of the Fusaka upgrade, which aims to achieve faster transactions and lower fees. This update is based on the Pectra fork and it focuses on scalability, security, and improved gas efficiency. Fusaka has been activated to the Sepolia and Holesky networks, and the last Hoodi testnet is planned for October 28. This upgrade has a gas limit of 16.78 million units per transaction to enhance reliability. The mainnet launch is scheduled for December 3 and may reinforce the role of Ethereum in decentralized finance. The lower fees will increase DeFi activity and restore confidence in long-term investors. Analysts describe Ethereum as one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy before the next bull cycle because of its clear roadmap and expanding ecosystem. Solana ETF Approval Boosts Global Confidence The approval of the first spot Solana ETF in Hong Kong has generated a new buzz among international investors. On October 27, the ChinaAMC Solana ETF will list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and offer trading in HKD, CNY, and USD. The ETF has an annual management fee of 0.99% and offers secure exposure to Solana’s performance. The ChinaAMC ETF focuses on eliminating the need to operate with the tokens directly. The framework makes OSL Digital Securities the sub-custodian. This scheme meets the high requirements of Hongkong digital-asset and enables institutions to adopt it. This development strengthens the growth trend of Solana. Its growing ecosystem and speed make it one of the best crypto to buy before the next bull cycle MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as a Top Growth Pick The approval of the first spot Solana ETF in Hong Kong has generated a new buzz among international investors.

53524736,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=842889,1761194765,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/53524736.jpeg,"South Korea maintains its interest rate at 2.5%, a decision some economists expected",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/south-korea-holds-the-interest-rate-at-2-5/,"Policymakers at South Korea’s central bank decided to maintain the benchmark interest rate at 2.5% on Thursday. The rate decision comes on the heels of new property restrictions in Seoul aimed at limiting debt growth. According to South Korean press reports on Oct. 15, the government expanded tougher property rules, including loan restrictions, to all 25 Seoul districts and 12 additional parts of Gyeonggi Province. Household debt remains a pressing issue for the Bank of Korea, which has avoided cutting interest rates to prevent a rebound in housing demand. Bank of America recognised that housing inflation is still a major focus in South Korea Economists polled by Reuters had widely expected the decision. The central bank has maintained a 3.5% rate for 1 year and 7 months before making four quarter-point cuts, two late last year and two earlier this year. It has now held rates steady for the third consecutive meeting , following similar moves in July and August. So far, analysts view the decision as aimed at cooling housing market sentiment, with Seoul’s property prices still firm even after the government’s June 27 measures restricting home loans to 600 million won, roughly $418,070. Speaking before the National Assembly’s Strategy and Finance Committee on the 20th, Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong stated, “From the Bank of Korea’s perspective, we aim not to play a role in fueling the real estate market by further increasing liquidity.” Around the same time, Bank of America analysts noted that Seoul’s housing inflation has remained a key focus for policymakers, acting as a major obstacle to additional rate cuts in the second half of 2025. The analysts asserted that housing prices in central Seoul rose around mid-September, despite earlier government efforts to rein in the market. Although they argued that the current measures are likely to reduce housing transactions gradually, it is unclear to what extent they can stabilize prices. South Korea is still finalizing the trade deal details with Washington. South Korea’s rate announcement also comes at a time of uncertainty in its trade relations with the U.S., as both governments struggle to conclude talks on a July 30 agreement. As part of the accord, South Korea is expected to invest $350 billion in the U.S.. However, President Lee Jae Myung warned in an interview that transferring it all at once could destabilize the economy. According to reports, negotiators plan to visit Washington this week to finalize details before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in South Korea on October 31. Kim Yong-beom, Seoul’s chief policy advisor, says talks have “moved beyond most issues,” though a few sticking points still need attention. Kim revealed this after returning from Washington, where he held meetings with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and senior economic officials. According to Kim, both sides now anticipate “real progress” before their presidents meet on the sidelines of the summit. The optimism came after months of gridlock. President Donald Trump had earlier said that Washington agreed to cut import tariffs on South Korean goods to 15%, provided that Seoul commits to $350 billion in U.S. investments. The announcement, made on July 30, marked a significant thaw in relations between the two economies. Still, auto tariffs remain in place as the two sides continue to haggle over how the investment will be structured and implemented. A South Korean delegation, headed by Kim Yong-beom, as well as the industry minister, Kim Jung-kwan, the finance minister, Koo Yun-cheol, and the trade minister, Yeo Han-koo, arrived in Washington last week to finalize details of the $350 billion pledge. As previously reported by Cryptopollitan, most of this will be in loans and guarantees rather than direct capital outflows, aiming to minimize the impact on foreign exchange markets, according to Seoul. Trump, meanwhile, had said that the payment would be made “upfront.” During its most recent meeting in August, the Bank of Korea revised its 2025 inflation estimate upward to 2% from 1.9%, and its growth projection to 0.9% from 0.8%. The BOK also anticipates a modest upturn in domestic demand, driven by additional fiscal spending and improving household sentiment. However, the bank warned that exports will probably maintain favorable trends for a while before slowing due to the expanding impact of U.S. tariffs. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Related Reading: The XRP Shockwave Will Hit When No One’s Watching—Analyst The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have agreed to legalize crypto settlements for international trade, allowing Russian exporters and importers to transact in Bitcoin and other digital assets. This follows an experimental legal regime introduced in September, which tested crypto use for cross-border settlements. BTC's price trends to the downside on the daily chart. Source: BTCUSD on Tradingview Russia Moves to Legalize Crypto for International Trade Under the new Russian policy, all crypto transactions for foreign trade will be processed through regulated channels supervised by the Central Bank, ensuring strict AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know-Your-Customer) compliance. The framework maintains Russia’s domestic crypto payment ban to protect the ruble but opens the door for Bitcoin- and stablecoin-based trade with partners in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America. Officials describe the reform as a “strategic necessity” that shields the economy from global financial isolation while promoting alternative trade routes. Bitcoin Authorized for Trade as Dedollarization Accelerates In a landmark development, Russia’s Ministry of Finance has authorized Bitcoin for foreign trade, marking one of the biggest policy reversals since the 2021 crypto ban. The move aligns with the Kremlin’s dedollarization agenda and leverages Russia’s massive energy reserves to support Bitcoin mining and liquidity. With over 2,395 BTC recently transferred by SpaceX’s corporate wallets sparking renewed market debate about corporate adoption, Moscow’s decision shows how state actors are now embracing the same asset once dismissed as “too volatile.” Analysts say Russia’s new framework may push BRICS nations like China and India to expand their own blockchain-based settlement systems, especially as global trade shifts away from dollar dependence. Bitcoin (BTC) rose past $108,500 following the announcement, with traders viewing Russia’s entry into crypto-backed commerce as validation of Bitcoin’s role as a neutral global reserve asset. Legal Integration and Global Implications Beyond trade, Russian lawmakers are also fast-tracking a Family Code amendment to classify cryptocurrency as marital property, a step toward full legal recognition of digital assets. The draft bill, sponsored by State Duma member Igor Antropenko, seeks to close loopholes that allow hidden crypto wealth during divorce proceedings, signaling how deeply digital assets are being woven into Russian law. If fully implemented, Russia’s crypto framework could reshape the geopolitical balance of finance. It offers a blueprint for sanctioned or developing economies to bypass Western-controlled systems like SWIFT.

ChinaAMC To List First Solana Spot ETF In Hong Kong As reported by the Hong Kong Economic Times, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) has approved the first Solana spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Hong Kong. A spot ETF is an investment vehicle that allows investors to gain exposure to an underlying asset without having to directly own it. In the case of a cryptocurrency like SOL, this means that traders can invest without having to hold actual tokens on the blockchain. Hong Kong approved spot ETFs for Bitcoin and Ethereum in April 2024. The BTC products followed three months after they were approved in the US by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), but the Chinese city led the way with ETH products. The same dynamic appears to be playing out again. With the US government currently facing a shutdown that has frozen SEC operations, Hong Kong’s SFC has beaten the American regulator to approving a Solana spot ETF. The spot ETF, issued by Chinese asset management company ChinaAMC, is set to launch on October 27th. It will be available in three trading lots: HKD, RMB, and USD. Each is equivalent to 100 tokens of the cryptocurrency. ChinaAMC previously launched Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs on the Hong Kong stock exchange as part of the initial wave of approvals granted by the SFC in April 2024. Over in the US, several SOL ETF filings are waiting to be processed , but with the current government shutdown, it’s unclear when they will finally be reviewed. Other altcoins like Dogecoin and XRP have also seen their filings similarly delayed. Speaking of the US spot ETFs, Bitcoin funds witnessed a notable amount of inflows on Tuesday, as data from SoSoValue shows. In total, the Bitcoin spot ETFs captured net inflows of about $477 million, breaking the trend of outflows from the last week. Ethereum funds also saw the incoming of capital, but their inflows of $141 million weren’t as significant as those of BTC products. As mentioned before, spot ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to a cryptocurrency’s price movements without directly having to own tokens on the blockchain. For traditional traders unfamiliar with digital asset exchanges and wallets, this quality can make these vehicles a convenient entry point into the asset. Bitcoin and Ethereum funds were able to tap into a new market in this way, and the same could potentially happen with Solana. That said, it only remains to be seen how demand for SOL spot ETFs will end up looking. SOL Price At the time of writing, Solana is trading around $186, down 8% over the last week.",Solana|hong kong|SOL|solana|Solana Hong Kong ETF|Solana Spot ETF|SOLUSDT,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|ETH|SOL|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-10-23 05:00:44

Rowe Price Files for First Active XRP ETF Holding,https://timestabloid.com/1-68-trillion-t-rowe-price-files-for-first-active-xrp-etf-holding/,"A recent update shared by crypto commentator JackTheRippler has shifted attention to a new filing from investment giant T. Rowe Price with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). According to the document shown, the firm submitted a Form S-1 registration statement on October 22, 2025, for a proposed “T. Rowe Price Active Crypto ETF.” The filing indicates the ETF would be sponsored by T. Rowe Price Sponsor LLC and appear under the Securities Act of 1933. The development is being discussed within the crypto sector as a notable instance of a major traditional finance player taking a formal regulatory step toward digital asset exposure, reportedly including XRP among its holdings. Community Reaction and Market Interpretation In the hours following the report, several users on X commented on the significance of the filing. One observer highlighted that traditional finance institutions increasingly appear to be entering the digital asset space, calling it a quiet but steady shift of capital and attention. Another described the move as a pivotal moment for institutional engagement with XRP, suggesting it could represent the beginning of more direct participation from large-scale asset managers. The general tone across these reactions centered on the expectation that a regulated, actively managed ETF backed by a firm of T. Rowe Price’s stature could signal expanding recognition of digital assets within established investment frameworks. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Understanding the Filing’s Implications The filing of a Form S-1 marks the preliminary stage of the registration process for an exchange-traded fund. It signals intent, but has not yet been approved to operate or list the product on an exchange. Details such as the ETF’s exact composition, weighing of assets, and management strategy are expected to become clearer in subsequent filings or amendments. The appearance of XRP in connection with the proposed ETF remains based on community interpretation of the report shared by JackTheRippler and other commentators, as the SEC has not yet published the full filing contents for public inspection. Institutional Implication If the filing proceeds as described, T. Rowe Price would become one of the most prominent global asset managers to register an active cryptocurrency ETF with exposure to XRP . The firm’s $1.68 trillion in assets under management underscores the scale of potential market impact should the fund advance through regulatory review and receive listing approval. Whether this marks a single initiative or part of a wider institutional trend will depend on additional disclosures and the SEC’s response to the registration.

Momentum remains weak, with the RSI at 27 indicating oversold conditions, but no reversal has occurred yet. The MACD stays negative, confirming bearish bias.

The Alligator lines remain in a downtrend, showing no confirmed reversal, but repeated tests near $0.0198 hint at base-building.

The price is struggling to clear $2.50 and might decline if it trades below the $2.320 support. XRP price is moving lower from the $2.550 zone. The price is now trading below $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $2.320 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $2.450 resistance. XRP Price Faces Resistance XRP price formed a base above $2.250 and started a recovery wave, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . The price surpassed the $2.40 and $2.420 resistance levels. The bulls were able to push the price above $2.50. However, the bears remained active near the $2.550 level. A high was formed at $2.5520 and the price recently corrected some gains. It dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.190 swing low to the $2.5520 high. Besides, there was a break below a connecting bullish trend line with support at $2.320 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. The price is now trading below $2.420 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If there is a fresh upward move, the price might face resistance near the $2.420 level. The first major resistance is near the $2.50 level, above which the price could rise and test $2.550. A clear move above the $2.550 resistance might send the price toward the $2.580 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $2.650 resistance. The next major hurdle for the bulls might be near $2.720. Another Drop? If XRP fails to clear the $2.420 resistance zone, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2.320 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $2.190 swing low to the $2.5520 high. The next major support is near the $2.2750 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $2.2750 level, the price might continue to decline toward $2.220. The next major support sits near the $2.20 zone, below which the price could continue lower toward $2.120. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.

There has been no September jobs report, any key inflation data, or initial jobless claims for weeks. Additionally, the Fed has lost access to key private jobs data from ADP, covering 20% of private workers, reported the WSJ and Kobeissi Letter. “The Fed must lean even more dovish as the government shutdown continues, and they must cut rates,” it said before adding: “In fact, odds of a 50 basis point rate cut by year-end are surging.” Impact On Crypto The Fed will continue to cut rates aggressively in the wake of the data blackout and stagflation for one simple reason: “they are afraid of being ‘too late’.” CME futures markets currently predict a 96.7% probability of a 25 basis point rate cut at the FOMC meeting on October 29. The likelihood of a further 0.25% cut in December has also surged to 96.5% and the odds of a third cut in January are almost 60%. When the Fed cuts rates , traditional safe investments like savings accounts, Treasury bonds, and money market funds offer lower returns. This makes riskier assets like crypto more attractive by comparison, as Investors seeking higher yields are more likely to allocate capital to crypto when they’re earning minimal interest elsewhere. Rate cuts also make borrowing cheaper, which puts more money into circulation throughout the financial system, increasing liquidity. “Many traders look back at positive Q4 performance, anticipating repetition, so they buy, and the price goes up,” said analyst ‘cryptobirb’ before adding: “All in all, the recent [leverage flush] crisis shouldn’t cancel year-end run.” “The government shutdown has halted the drain of the TGA (Treasury General Account) and No RRP (Reverse Repo Facility) to drain [which means] less liquidity (temporarily) [leading to] sloppy crypto as the pointy end of the liquidity spear,” said economist Raoul Pal, who added, “This too shall pass.” The government shutdown has halted the drain of the TGA + No RRP to drain > Less liquidity (temporarily) > sloppy crypto as the pointy end of the liquidity spear. This too shall pass.. If you don’t understand best ask @grok or the Raoulbot on @RealVision for my views https://t.co/AXsQMVgz7l — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI) October 23, 2025 The Senate failed to advance the House-passed funding bill that would end the government shutdown for the 12th time on Wednesday, which means the stalemate will continue. Markets Begin to Consolidate Crypto markets have not moved much over the past 24 hours, with total capitalization at $3.75 trillion. Bitcoin has traded in a tight range around the key $108,000 support-turned-resistance level and has struggled to break above it.

BTC dropped to $108,600, down by 14% from its highest point this year. This article explores some of the top reasons why the BTC price may drop further in the near term. Bitcoin price is about to form a death cross The daily timeframe chart shows that the coin has been in a strong bearish downtrend in the past few months. It has plunged from the year-to-date high of $126,300 to the current $108,600. A closer look shows that it is about to form a death cross pattern as the spread between the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages (EMA) has continued to narrow in the past few days. This is a sign that the coin is about to form a death cross, which often leads to more downside. Bitcoin price has also formed a double-top pattern at $124,375 and a neckline at $108,357, its lowest level in June. This double-top pattern’s depth is about 12.2%. Measuring the same distance from the neckline goves it a target of $95,000, which coincides with the extreme oversold level of the Murrey Math Lines tool. Bitcoin price is also in the process of forming a bearish pennant pattern, which is made up of a vertical line and a symmetrical triangle pattern. Bitcoin price chart | Source: TradingView BTC price has formed a rising wedge and divergence The other main reason why the Bitcoin price may crash further is that numerous bearish patterns have formed on the weekly chart. Bitcoin has formed a rising wedge pattern, which happens when there are two rising and converging trendlines. The two lines are about to converge, which may lead to a strong bearish breakout. At the same time, top oscillators show that the coin has more downside as it has formed a bearish divergence pattern. The True Strength Index (TSI) has continued moving downwards as Bitcoin has jumped. Other oscillators have also continued forming a bearish divergence pattern. This includes popular indicators like the Percentage Price Oscillator (PPO) and the Relative Strength Index (RSI). These patterns point to more downside in the near term. The price target is established by first measuring the distance of the widest part and then the same one from the breakout point. This distance is about 48%, meaning that the coin may crash below $60,000 in the coming months. BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Crypto Fear and Greed Index is falling The other key catalyst for the Bitcoin price crash is that there is a sense of fear happening in the crypto industry. Data shows that the Crypto Fear and Greed Index has tumbled to the fear zone of 28. It has been in a major downtrend after peaking at the greed zone of 63 in May this year. Crypto Fear and Greed Index chart | Source: CMC The CNN Money Fear and Greed Index has moved to the fear zone of 26. Further downside will have it move to the extreme fear zone of 25. Most of the gauges, including the stock price breadth, put and call options, safe haven demand, and junk bond demand have all moved to the extreme fear zone. This fear explains why investors have been reluctant to invest in Bitcoin ETFs. These funds had a net outflow of $1.28 billion last week. While they have gained $335 million so far this week, they have remained lower than their historical standards. Bitcoin price may also continue falling as US inflation remains at an elevated level. Higher inflation may prevent the Fed from cutting rates aggressively.

The move marks T. Rowe Price’s first foray into the crypto fund space and a notable shift for a company that manages $1.8 trillion in assets. T. Rowe Price Crypto ETF Comes as a Surprise Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, described the move as a “semi-shock,” underscoring its unexpected yet impactful entry. “Did not expect it but I get it.

Besides, this is a rare kind of proposal for new multi-coin products, he added. “It’s a surprise to see them as a relatively late entrant, but they’re planning to offer something differentiated to try and break into the space,” he told Reuters. Crypto Fund to Hold 15 Digital Assets: S-1 Prospectus Reveals Per the SEC filing, the multi-crypto ETF would track prices of 15 digital assets, including Bitcoin , Ethereum , XRP , Solana , Cardano , Litecoin and more. The fund may invest in other eligible assets not mentioned, the S1 prospectus read. “Under normal circumstances, the Fund is expected to hold between five and fifteen crypto assets; however, the Fund may hold more or less at any time.” T. Rowe Price joins a growing list of asset managers looking to list ETFs based on crypto and altcoins. Per Eric Balchunas, there are 155 crypto ETF filings tracking 35 different digital assets so far. “Could easily end up seeing over 200 hit mkt in next 12 months,” he wrote.

Despite the subdued macro backdrop, HTX achieved solid growth across trading volume, user acquisition, listing innovation, brand activity, and security, marking another standout quarter for the exchange. Steadily Growing Trading Volume, Assets, and Organic Traffic In the third quarter of 2025, HTX’s total trading volume rose by 25% quarter-over-quarter, while new registrations grew by 13%, expanding the platform’s user base to new highs. Total user assets on HTX reached $6.87 billion, up 6.4% from the previous quarter, solidifying the platform’s position as the world’s leading exchange. Traffic metrics also reflected the platform’s rising influence, with total impressions up 7% to 13 million, page views up 37% to 46 million, and unique visitors up 43% to 19 million. The continued growth in organic traffic underscores HTX’s expanding global reach and user engagement. High-Quality New Assets Become Wealth Boosters and Quarterly $HTX Burn Hits New High Q3 also marked a breakthrough for new listings. HTX introduced 39 quality projects, including initial listings such as TREE , CAMP , WLFI , HOLO , LINEA , AVNT , ASTER , 0G , XPL , and FF . Many of these generated outsized returns for early participants. AVNT, ASTER, 0G, and XPL all presented a near doubling of investments. ASTER , featuring an innovative “no-MEV, low-slippage” model, surged by 400% after listing, becoming the quarter’s top performer. AVNT , a standout Base ecosystem token, delivered a threefold increase, while WLFI , a DeFi project backed by the Trump family, captured broad market attention. HTX’s steady stream of promising assets further reinforced its reputation as a launchpad for new opportunities and a premier destination for early-stage token listings. On the tokenomics front, HTX DAO officially announced the completion of its Q3 $HTX burn on October 14, a total of 13,119,801,941,748 $HTX, worth over $27.03 million. This burn, up 11.19% quarter-over-quarter, sets a new record since the launch of the burn mechanism. Cumulatively, HTX DAO has now burnt approximately 85.88 trillion $HTX tokens, valued at $163 million. These ongoing deflationary measures continue to optimize token circulation and strengthen $HTX’s long-term value foundation. Meanwhile, HTX DAO is expanding its global developer ecosystem, focusing on CeFi–DeFi integration, RWA innovation, and other on-chain $HTX applications, empowering builders with resources, exposure, and sustainable growth opportunities. Marketing Campaigns and Branding for Greater Global Influence HTX maintained strong marketing momentum throughout Q3 with a series of high-engagement events, covering stablecoin trading, Ethereum’s 10th anniversary, the TRON brand, and trending assets like SOL, TRUMP, USD1, and WLFI. These events attracted over 100,000 registered participants and airdropped tens of billions of $HTX, enhancing platform activity and amplifying its global brand visibility. In terms of brand exposure, HTX continued to expand both online and offline reach. At GM Vietnam, more than 1,300 users registered onsite, setting a strong tone for the quarter. During TOKEN2049 Singapore and the afterparty, HTX DAO and HTX Ventures achieved a combined brand reach of 254 million impressions, over 3,100 clients, and 800 industry professionals with the 12th-anniversary “Flame” element leaving a lasting impression. Meanwhile, Justin Sun attended the afterparty and awarded the top 3 performers at the Miss HTX Finals. Product Upgrades and Forward-Looking Research From a product standpoint, HTX introduced key product upgrades to enhance security and experience. Accounts now support YubiKeys, providing enhanced account protection. Spot trading received a comprehensive overhaul, while Collateral Swap 2.0 went live, offering multi-asset collateral and interest-free borrowing to support users’ diversified asset management needs. HTX Ventures and HTX Research continued to publish influential insights throughout the quarter. HTX Ventures released a string of reports, including “Are Tokenized Stocks A Treat or A Trap?” , analyzing the emerging stock tokenization, regulatory trends, and institutional coordination for in-depth reading of the RWA sector. HTX Research published its flagship reports “The New Stablecoin Order: Restructuring Global Payments, Regulatory Legitimization, and the Capital War (Part I)” and “The New Order of Stablecoins (Part II): Exploring Stablecoin Public Blockchains — From Settlement Layer Reconstruction to Next-Generation Design Paradigms” , dissecting stablecoin payment reconstruction, regulatory progress, and blockchain-native settlement models. The reports have since become widely cited across the industry. Additionally, the midyear report “H1 2025 Key Industry Highlights: DAT Becomes the Standard, Perpetual DEX Aggregators Surge, Stablecoin Channels Dominate, and More” provided a comprehensive review of sectoral trends, highlighting TRON and HTX as key drivers in the evolving stablecoin and new asset markets. Further Strengthening Security and Premium Service with the Anti-Scam Official Channel Security remains at the heart of HTX’s operations, proven by great risk management efforts and multi-layer security building.

He expects Bitcoin to stay between $100,000 and $125,000 unless new catalysts emerge. Meanwhile, optimism is rising elsewhere as Japan’s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, introduced a major stimulus package that could boost Bitcoin demand through increased liquidity. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes called the move a sign of more money printing and predicted it could eventually drive Bitcoin to $1 million. 250K Bitcoin Is Unrealistic Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz poured some cold water on the popular prediction that Bitcoin will hit $250,000 by the end of the year. He did this by saying that such a move would require extraordinary circumstances. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, Novogratz said that with just over two months left in 2025, it would take “a heck of a lot of crazy stuff” for Bitcoin to gain the kind of momentum needed to more than double its current price. At press time, Bitcoin was trading around $108,56. This means it would need to surge roughly 130+% in just ten weeks to reach the ambitious target. Mike Novogratz’s CNBC interview Novogratz believes that a more realistic outcome is for Bitcoin to trade within a range rather than experience another parabolic rally before the year’s end. He said that, in a worst-case scenario, Bitcoin should hold around $100,000, which is a key psychological level it first broke in December 2024 after Donald Trump’s reelection as US president. That price point was nearly tested earlier this month after Trump announced sweeping 100% tariffs on China, which sent Bitcoin tumbling to about $102,000. On the upside, Novogratz said Bitcoin would need to break past $125,000, its previous all-time high, to regain bullish momentum. He also said that the market is likely to stay “rangy between $100,000 and $120,000 or $125,000” unless new catalysts emerge. BTC’s price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) According to Novogratz, potential triggers that could propel Bitcoin higher include Trump attempting to influence the Federal Reserve’s policy decisions or the passage of the long-awaited CLARITY Act, or a crypto market structure bill that could provide regulatory clarity for digital assets. The crypto community is also closely watching the Federal Reserve, with a 96.7% probability of another rate cut at the upcoming Oct. 29 meeting, according to CME’s Fed Watch Tool. Bitcoin analyst PlanC argues that focusing too much on short-term price targets misses the point. “Anyone who thinks Bitcoin has to peak in Q4 of this year does not understand statistics or probability,” he said, and suggested that Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory matters far more than where it ends the year. Japan’s Stimulus Sparks Bitcoin Optimism Others are a lot more optimistic about BTC’s capabilities. Japan’s new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, unveiled a sweeping economic stimulus package that is aimed at easing the burden of inflation on households, a move that some crypto observers believe could channel more capital into Bitcoin. The stimulus plan includes subsidies for electricity and gas bills, as well as regional grants designed to help small and medium-sized businesses raise wages and maintain operations amid rising costs. While the program is intended to offer relief to struggling households, critics argue it could also trigger another round of monetary expansion by Japan’s central bank, which has historically been bullish for Bitcoin. BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes was among the first people to weigh in by calling the move a prelude to further fiat money printing by the Bank of Japan. “Translation: let’s print money to hand out to folks to help with food and energy costs,” Hayes wrote on X, and predicted that such a policy could push Bitcoin’s price as high as $1 million while also strengthening the Japanese yen in the short term. His comments came as the yen slipped to a one-week low after Takaichi’s appointment as Japan’s first female prime minister. Many investors see her “pro-stimulus” stance as a potential precursor to a pivot by the Bank of Japan toward quantitative easing, a policy of buying bonds and injecting liquidity into the economy to stimulate growth. Although the Bank of Japan is still in a phase of quantitative tightening, with no official plan to return to QE until inflation stabilizes at 2%, analysts suggest that Takaichi’s policies could accelerate an eventual shift. The central bank’s next policy meeting on Oct. 29 is expected to shed some more light on its direction, though most forecasts anticipate a 0.75% interest rate hike by early 2026. Meanwhile, large Bitcoin holders appear to be growing increasingly bullish. After Bitcoin’s dip to a four-month low of $104,000 last week, several “whales” have returned to the market. According to blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain , three major wallets deposited tens of millions of dollars onto the decentralized exchange Hyperliquid this week to open leveraged long positions. One of them, identified as “0x3fce,” expanded its Bitcoin position to $49.7 million, while another, “0x89AB,” opened a 6x leveraged long worth $14 million. The renewed whale activity suggests that there is rising confidence that Japan’s stimulus measures could act as a catalyst for Bitcoin’s next major rally.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-10-23 05:30:00

The Tesla CEO told investors during third-quarter earnings call event that he wanted to “make a point of clarification,” saying both chipmakers will handle the next batch of AI5 production. Tesla depends on these AI chips to power its self-driving software and the Optimus robots it’s still developing.Musk said the company uses the chips alongside Nvidia’s hardware, which leads the market for AI computing processors. Samsung, meanwhile, is chasing TSMC’s dominance in the foundry industry, where chips are made for outside clients. It’s already building a major semiconductor hub near Austin, Texas, not far from Tesla’s own base. Samsung signs $16.5 billion deal and joins Tesla’s AI push Back in July, Elon confirmed that Samsung would also make Tesla’s AI6 chip, the next generation after the AI5. That followed a Cryptopolitan report about a $16.5 billion deal between the two companies, which gave Samsung’s foundry division one of its largest outside orders. Elon had said then that Samsung was already handling the older AI4 chip, while TSMC was responsible for the AI5. The update now means both companies will be producing Tesla’s current AI hardware, splitting the workload across two supply chains. Samsung may still trail TSMC, but this deal gives it a visible foothold in one of the most high-profile chip programs in the world. For Tesla, it means less reliance on a single supplier and more production capacity as the company ramps up development for its autonomous driving software and humanoid robots. Elon didn’t reveal how the chip work will be divided, only saying both partners are “focused initially on AI5.” But the call wasn’t just about chips. Musk completely skipped any update on EV demand, especially after the federal tax credit expired last month. There was no mention of Cybertruck, and he didn’t touch tariffs or fourth-quarter guidance either, which is pretty unusual.. Elon outlines robotaxi rollout and teases new Optimus robot Instead of talking about cars or profits, Elon went straight to his comfort zone; robotaxis and robots. He told investors that the company’s self-driving plans are about to “take off like a shock wave.” Elon claimed Tesla already has “millions of cars out there that, with a software update, become full self-driving cars,” adding that Tesla is “making a couple million a year.” He said robotaxi service will begin in Austin by the end of this year, running without human drivers. By late 2025, the service should expand to eight to ten cities, though early versions will still keep drivers on board. Tesla’s Chief Financial Officer Vaibhav Taneja added that adoption of FSD Supervised, the company’s partially automated system, remains “small,” with just 12% of users paying for it. He didn’t disclose pricing, only saying Tesla ran several promotions to boost signups. After discussing robotaxis, Elon turned to the Optimus humanoid robot, saying it could become “the biggest product of all time.” The robot isn’t on the market yet, but he described new capabilities, saying “Optimus will be an incredible surgeon.” Elon said that with both Optimus and self-driving tech, “you can actually create a world where there is no poverty, where everyone has access to the finest medical care.” He also said Tesla would demo a new version called Optimus V3 in the first quarter of 2026, promising significant upgrades from the current prototype. The call ended with him returning to the robot topic over and over again, tying it to his controversial $1 trillion pay package. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

At the time of writing, ZEC is priced at $240, with a 24-hour trading volume of $730 million. Meanwhile, the token is down slightly in the past 24 hours but remains up over 460% over the past month (CoinGecko data). The 24-hour price range shows a high of $308 and a low of $237, indicating high intraday volatility following a sharp rally. Wedge Pattern Approaches Resistance Current chart patterns show ZEC forming an ascending wedge. This structure often appears during strong rallies and typically signals a point where momentum begins to narrow. The price is now approaching a resistance zone between $280 and $313, marked by Murrey Math levels. These levels are often referenced by traders during periods of overextension. Movement into this zone has slowed. If volume increases, the price may test this resistance again. If not, the market may start to turn back toward lower support levels. The closest zones of support on the chart appear at $250 and $220. Source: TradingView In addition, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached 69, close to the typical overbought mark of 70. The 14-day RSI moving average is now at 70, which suggests momentum has stretched. So far, the RSI has not broken above the overbought level. However, staying near these levels may lead to sideways trading as participants wait for a new direction. A short pullback is also a common reaction when RSI hovers at these highs. Multi-Year Breakout Meets Initial Target ZEC recently completed a major technical breakout. According to analyst Javon Marks, the token ended a downtrend that lasted over a year and a half. After the breakout, the price moved quickly toward $308, which matched a key target. Marks stated , “Another >1,000% callout in the books.” A second target has been placed near $596.65, though this remains above current levels. The move followed a period of low resistance and accelerating buying volume. The price has not yet shown any extended correction, though activity near $308 may lead to consolidation. Futures Interest and Mixed Market Sentiment According to Coinglass, open interest in ZEC futures reached $306.3 million, rising from under $50 million in September. This sharp increase reflects a surge in speculative participation. Such growth often coincides with higher volatility and larger position sizes. Source: Coinglass Market sentiment remains split. Analyst Henry wrote , “ZEC looks cooked. $311 wick was the exit liquidity.” He also added that failure to hold above $300 could lead to moves toward the mid-$240 range. He referenced a possible head and shoulders pattern forming, while noting that bulls would need to act quickly to change momentum. As CryptoPotato posted on X, Zcash founder Zooko responded to recent price speculation by saying, “I don’t know why the Zcash price has been skyrocketing. And I don’t know if it is going to go back down.” He also dismissed suggestions of coordinated market manipulation, calling them “ just more cynical propaganda .” The post ZEC Hits $308 Then Dumps Hard: What’s Next for This Breakout? appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|Zcash (ZEC) Price,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|ZEC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-10-23 05:35:33

The figure marks a dramatic jump from just four months back when the company was worth far less. The company’s value has climbed fast this year. Back in June, Polymarket secured $200 million from investors led by Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund. At that time, the startup was valued at $1 billion. Then earlier this month, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., which runs the New York Stock Exchange, announced plans to put up to $2 billion into Polymarket. That deal priced the company at around $8 billion before counting the new money coming in. The transaction also made Shayne Coplan, Polymarket’s chief executive, the youngest person to become a billionaire through building their own business. Kalshi valuation race heats up Meanwhile, Kalshi, which competes directly with Polymarket, is getting offers from investors who want in at valuations above $10 billion. According to Bloomberg, that would be more than twice what the company was worth in a funding deal announced just weeks ago. The rapid rise in these valuations shows how much excitement there is around this young industry where betting and finance are coming together. Both Polymarket and Kalshi have seen betting activity jump recently as reported by Cryptopolitan . During the week that ended October 19, total trading hit more than $2 billion across both platforms. That beat the earlier record set during last year’s presidential election. Wall Street giants rush to partner with prediction markets Big financial firms and gambling companies are paying attention. They’re making deals with these prediction market leaders, betting the newcomers might reshape their businesses. On Wednesday, Coplan said Polymarket would serve as a clearinghouse for DraftKings Inc. as that company enters prediction markets. The same day, the National Hockey League announced multi-year agreements with both Kalshi and Polymarket , making it the first big American sports league to partner with these platforms. Still, prediction markets face unclear rules ahead. While federal regulators have let Kalshi open new markets, state gambling officials have fought back in court. Questions about market manipulation and insider trading also remain unresolved.

A survey of 50 economists showed that most of them think the BOJ will wait till December to change its rates. Only 10% of economists think the Bank of Japan will raise rates on October 30, down from 36% before. Takaichi’s leadership makes the BOJ more cautious about raising rates Sanae Takaichi won the leadership race of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and became Japan’s new Prime Minister . Experts say the BOJ won’t rush to make any changes to its interest rates because the new Prime Minister has consistently supported keeping rates low, allowing more money to flow into the economy. She did not specify when or how the central bank should react. Still, people expect that she prefers stability over sudden financial tightening, given her popular views and long-standing political history. Before Takaichi came to office, people thought the BOJ would raise interest rates in October, but now they expect it to wait until December or even next year. Economists say the bank will cooperate with the government to avoid any disagreements, as the Prime Minister favors long-term support for growth through low borrowing costs. Senior economist at Sompo Institute Plus, Masato Koike, said, “Takaichi is probably thinking a rate hike is undesirable even after she’s softened her tone.” Experts say policymakers at the BOJ will tread carefully because they don’t want the public and investors to think the bank is going against the wishes of the government. Cooperation between the bank and the government will ensure that investors remain confident and that the country’s economic status remains stable. According to a new survey, 72% of economists said that the chances of the BOJ raising its interest rates in October have decreased significantly, largely due to the political change. More than half of the survey respondents stated that the bank could harm its relationship and cooperation with the new government if it were to increase interest rates now. Analysts say that the central bank will be very careful in how it communicates to the public, so that markets don’t misunderstand its goals and avoid spreading confusion among investors. Before Takaichi, many economists predicted that the central bank would issue an interest rate of about 1.25%, but that figure has now dropped to 1%. The market can already feel her influence in the way experts talk about Japan’s monetary policy, and many people say her leadership will have a great influence on how and when the BOJ acts in the months ahead. BOJ struggles to control yen weakness while calming market doubts The BOJ is facing a weak yen, a volatile market, and a new government under Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Masamichi Adachi, Chief Japan economist at UBS Securities and a former Bank of Japan official, said the BOJ should raise its rates. He explained that the bank needs to show the public that it is serious about moving away from years of the same low interest rates. However, making a move right now could cause unexpected changes in the yen and bond markets, as people have very low expectations of an interest rate spike. Adachi said the bank doesn’t want to surprise investors because the market isn’t well prepared for such changes, and so it will most likely postpone its new rates. All eyes are currently on the BOJ as it plans to announce its quarterly economic outlook and policy decision next week. Many experts believe the bank will not make significant changes to its economic and inflation forecast from the previous report. They believe the central bank will only make a minor upward adjustment to indicate some improvement in exports and business investments, but inflation statistics will remain unchanged. Senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management, Katsutoshi Inadome, said the central bank should maintain steady interest rates for now, while still sounding confident about the chances of a future hike. He explained that the BOJ will prevent the yen from weakening too much before its next rate hike if it conveys a hawkish hold in its report. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

53526010,https://cryptonews.com/?p=442300,1761198547,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/53526010.jpeg,"Crypto Lost 1,000 Jobs To AI Since ChatGPT Debut, Yet Hiring Recovered: A16z",https://cryptonews.com/news/crypto-jobs-lost-to-ai-since-chatgpt-debut-yet-hiring-recovered-a16z/,"Crypto’s workforce took an early hit from the artificial intelligence boom, but has since rebounded, according to Andreessen Horowitz’s State of Crypto 2025 report released Wednesday. The firm found that around 1,000 jobs have shifted from crypto companies to AI startups since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, but an equivalent number of professionals have joined the industry from other sectors. The report analyzed job movements from Nov. 2022 to Sept. 2025 and showed that crypto has lost workers to AI startups, which continue to attract technical talent. However, the sector has replenished its ranks with new hires from technology, finance, consulting and education. Roughly 12,000 people moved into or out of crypto roles during that period, suggesting a dynamic and fluid job market. AI Lured Builders Away, But Crypto Recovered Hiring Momentum From Other Industries A16z said crypto gained about 1,000 net jobs from other industries even as AI pulled away a similar number of employees. The largest inflows came from tech firms, which contributed over 12,000 professionals, followed by finance and consulting with around 6,000. Smaller inflows came from education and other sectors. The shift shows the increasingly intertwined relationship between crypto and AI. Since ChatGPT’s debut, AI has drawn both capital and talent across the tech landscape. Many developers have pivoted to AI projects, while others have found new opportunities in crypto’s resurgent markets. ChatGPT’s arrival in Nov. 2022 coincided with one of crypto’s darkest periods, marked by the collapse of FTX and a sharp contraction in venture funding. At the time, job losses, declining token prices, and regulatory uncertainty shook the industry’s confidence. AI Consolidates Power While Crypto Continues To Champion Decentralization: A16z Today, the landscape looks very different. The global crypto market capitalization has surpassed US$4 trillion, with Bitcoin reaching new record highs this year. The rebound comes amid a friendlier regulatory tone from the Trump administration, which has supported legislation for stablecoins and digital asset oversight. Institutional adoption is also deepening as firms such as JPMorgan, BlackRock, and Fidelity expand their crypto offerings. A16z’s analysis shows that much of the new hiring in crypto now comes from professionals with finance and fintech backgrounds, reflecting the sector’s gradual convergence with traditional financial systems. The firm noted that crypto’s talent pipeline is diversifying beyond developers, with growing demand for compliance, infrastructure, and product specialists. At the same time, AI’s growth has raised questions about centralization and market concentration. The report said OpenAI and Anthropic control 88% of all revenue from AI-native companies, while Amazon, Microsoft, and Google hold 63% of the cloud infrastructure market. NVIDIA continues to dominate hardware with a 94% share of data center GPUs. This concentration, A16z noted, contrasts sharply with the decentralized ethos of crypto. Crypto Standards Are Evolving To Let AI Agents Transact And Access Data Without Intermediaries Blockchains, the firm said, could serve as a counterweight to AI’s centralizing forces by powering open networks, verifiable compute, and transparent data systems. Emerging crypto standards such as x402 aim to support autonomous AI agents, enabling them to perform microtransactions and access APIs without intermediaries — a market Gartner expects could reach $30 trillion by 2030. Meanwhile, A16z identified stablecoins as one of the strongest signals of crypto’s maturity. The report found that stablecoins processed about $9 trillion in the past 12 months, an 87% jump from a year earlier. That figure represents more than half of Visa’s annual payments volume and more than five times PayPal’s. The report said that although AI drew away some of crypto’s early talent, the industry’s rebound and growing presence among major institutions point to a clear return of confidence.

Two Whales Have Accumulated Over 1.4 Million Links in Recent Months According to the data, the whale with the address 0xf386 withdrew 62,207 LINK (approximately $1.07 million) from the OKX exchange approximately five hours ago. With this latest transaction, the amount of LINK accumulated by that address over the past five months has reached approximately 1.1 million units (approximately $19 million). Similarly, another whale with the address 0xe8aa withdrew 66,113 LINK (approximately $1.14 million) from the Kraken exchange 14 hours ago. This address's total LINK haul over the past month brings the total amount to 307,684 LINK (approximately $5.34 million). The accumulation of LINK by large investors in recent weeks, according to on-chain data, suggests a renewed surge in institutional interest. Chainlink's efforts, particularly in the integration of DeFi and real-world assets (RWA), support long-term confidence in the project. According to experts, this accumulation process demonstrates that LINK has strong fundamental value despite market-wide volatility. Increased whale buying could contribute to price stability and usher in a potential future uptrend. Finally, the Chainlink ecosystem has been keeping investor interest alive recently with developments in both staking programs and data oracle solutions. *This is not investment advice.

Related Reading: Fetch.AI CEO Offers Reward To ‘Uncover’ Ocean Protocol’s Alleged $120M FET Dump Spot Market Sees Strong Q3 Performance On Wednesday, crypto exchange MEXC published its Q3 2025 Ecosystem & Growth Report, highlighting sustained expansion, robust user activity, and security from the previous quarter. According to the report, the exchange experienced strong activity and trading momentum during the market run between July and September, with over 680 new tokens added to the crypto exchange in Q3, representing a 17% increase from Q2. Moreover, the number of active users trading new listings in the exchange increased 16%, while the trading volume for these tokens surged 97%. The report also noted that the spot market had a “particularly robust” performance last quarter, with the top 10 highest-volume tokens recording an average peak gain of 2,933%, a 158% jump from Q2. Notably, memecoins, AI + Web3, Perpetual Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), and stablecoin protocols were among the dominant narratives, with tokens like STBL, Chainbase (C), and DeAgentAI (AIA) showing remarkable 500% to 12,00% performances. Meanwhile, the BSC ecosystem outperformed all other ecosystems, taking six of the top 10 tokens by growth in the crypto exchange. The report detailed that BSC projects produced an average return of over 9,000%, including TALE, BAS, and MEAL. It’s worth noting that the BSC outperformed other networks in DEX activity earlier this month, with data showing that it recently ranked first across all chains, surpassing Ethereum and Solana on DEX daily trading and chain fees. Additionally, BSC reached a new all-time high (ATH) of 5.02 trillion gas used in a single day two weeks ago. MEXC also highlighted that BSC’s strength was matched by the Ethereum and Base ecosystems, which recorded strong performance with GAIA, ERA, and Avantis (AVNT), “representing the growing cross-chain vitality of Layer-2 and DeFi derivative protocols.” Crypto Losses Trend Slows Down The report revealed that the crypto exchange intercepted 48 fraud cases last quarter, freezing nearly $5 million in illicit funds. As part of its efforts to prevent fraud, it also restricted more than 19,000 suspicious accounts, including 17,000 collusive accounts and over 2,000 bot-trading accounts. Notably, a concerning trend that has been developing this year, which could drive theft from digital asset services to a new milestone by the end of 2025. According to Chainalysis, crypto theft this year has been “more devastating” than the entirety of 2024, with over $2.7 billion worth of funds stolen from crypto services in the first half of 2025. Related Reading: Bitcoin (BTC) Price Eyes $114,000 Retest Amid Bounce, But Analyst Suggests Caution As reported by NewsBTC, hacks significantly increase at the start of Q3, driving over $100 million in losses for exchanges. Q2 showed a diminishing trend in total crypto losses, with May and June recording 40% and 56% month-on-month (MoM) declines, respectively. This trend briefly shifted in July as the total value of stolen funds surged 27.2% from the previous month. Nonetheless, recent reports show that total funds lost to crypto hacks and exploits dropped around 37% in Q3, despite the market rally and initial trend.

53526539,612032,1761199233,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png,"Ethereum Market Outlook: $4,100 Resistance Holds as BlackRock and Major Funds Boost Exposure",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-market-outlook-as-the-4100-resistance-hold/,"After two weeks of a disappointing run, Ethereum (ETH) is once again capturing institutional interest as major funds and asset managers step into the smart-contract platform. According to recent data, Bitmine Immersion Technologies purchased approximately $251 million worth of ETH, adding 63,539 tokens to its portfolio and bringing its holdings to over 3 million ETH ($13 billion). Institutional Capital Flows Bolster Ethereum’s Bullish Case BlackRock’s clients have added $41.91 million in Ethereum , marking another sign of growing institutional adoption. These inflows come as Ethereum breaks out of a descending trendline pattern and parallels the rally seen in gold, with ETH’s correlation to gold reaching 0.7 in Q3 2025, driven by ETF inflows and DeFi-driven growth. On-chain metrics further reinforce this accumulation narrative. Wallets are moving more ETH off exchanges, signaling long-term holding behavior, while tokenization and DeFi usage on Ethereum’s network continue to expand meaningfully. Institutions appear to be treating Ethereum not just as a speculative bet, but increasingly as a foundational infrastructure asset, particularly given Ethereum’s post-Proof-of-Stake upgrade energy efficiency and suitability for ESG mandates. Ethereum Holds $4,100 Resistance, Eyes on $4,440 From a technical vantage, Ethereum is testing the key resistance zone near $4,100–$4,440. Analysts like Ali Martinez point out the recent breakout of the descending trendline provides a bullish structural shift, but only if support levels remain intact. The most critical support lies near $3,800, with a deeper fallback to $3,600 if momentum fades. A sustained move above $4,440 could unlock a run toward $4,800–$5,000, provided institutional flows and macro conditions align. Conversely, a close below $3,800 would weaken the momentum thesis and potentially invite a retracement toward $3,560 or lower. With ETF flows, macro liquidity, and network fundamentals converging, Ethereum is showing a rare blend of structural strength, but execution is key. The near-term jury is out until Ethereum closes decisively above $4,100 with volume confirming the move.

Ethereum (ETH) and Chainlink are holding strong support levels, indicating renewed confidence in the market. Traders are now searching for the best altcoins to buy that show signs of an early opportunity, before the next wave of inflows starts. Market sentiment is still cautious, but analysts see increasing accumulation in a number of high-potential projects. Hyperliquid, MAGACOINFINANCE , and Avalanche are drawing attention with their solid fundamentals, steady growth, and growing participation by their communities. All of these coins are some of the best altcoins to buy before the rotation of capital picks up. Ethereum Price Analysis: Leading the Best Altcoins to Buy Ethereum Price continues to face pressure at a key support level, with traders observing for any signs of reversal. ETH was trading at nearly $3,945 at the time of writing, far below the all-time high of $4,963. The setup presents a potential upside even after this pullback as long as support holds. Source: TradingView The three-day chart displays ETH dipping from $4,963 to $3,930, but it remains bullish above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. Also, it’s above the pivot reversal level on the Murrey Math Lines tool, indicating that buyers are holding on to some key territory. ETH is currently trading close to a major swing level established during previous cycles just below $4,087, but is still holding above the Supertrend indicator. A new bullish flag formation is developing, which may break out to $5000. The bullish view would fade only if the price drops below $3,500. The fundamentals of Ethereum are still strong. The network recorded over $1 trillion in stablecoin transactions this month. Transaction volumes increased to 25.9 million, while revenue increased to $16.8 million. These figures prove that Ethereum remains one of the best altcoins to buy before the next leg higher. Chainlink (LINK) Holds Support Before Q4 Rotation Chainlink is trading in a descending channel and has bounced off the lower side of the channel around $16.60 recently. This is typically the end of a corrective phase, as buyers are starting to come back into the market. The price has been heading toward $18, with resistance levels at $20.02, $23.75, and $27.81. Source: TradinView A bullish continuation can be confirmed by a breakout above $20, and near resistance, the rejection can lead to short-term consolidation. Exchange reserves reduced by 6.18% to about $2.88 billion, which shows holders moving LINK off exchanges and reducing supply. Strong whale accumulation around $16 and long-side dominance on the futures data indicate increasing optimism. The scarcity of the supply can position Chainlink as one of the best altcoins to buy before Q4 rotation starts to accelerate. MAGACOIN FINANCE Sparks FOMO Among Early Buyers In the face of Q4 rotation expectations, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing strong attention from investors who are positioning before the next wave. Whale activity indicates initial accumulation over multiple wallets, suggesting increased conviction. Retail traders are doing the same by rushing to grab the last of the tokens before prices increase further. The tightening supply has led to clear signs of FOMO across the community, as engagement and transactions have seen a sharp increase. Analysts also suggest that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s transparency, early-stage development, and clear roadmap towards growth make it an attractive choice for investors looking to get an early start in the next phase of the market. Those who position early may get more upside potential as liquidity and awareness build up over the rotation cycle. Hyperliquid (HYPE): Buybacks Strengthen One of the Best Altcoins to Buy Hyperliquid moves closer to a breakout as steady buyback, strong on-chain growth, and strong fundamentals keep the market’s confidence. The project has bought back more than $521 million worth of HYPE, burning 5.6% of the circulating supply. Source: Tokenomist Another $3 million was repurchased yesterday, for a total of $108 million in one month. These consistent buybacks reduce the liquidity in the market, which results in a stable price in case of corrections. The activation of HyperEVM has further added to the current optimism as the ecosystem grows. Support between $34 and $37 has continued to hold for a solid foundation for a breakout. Hyperliquid is one of the best altcoins to buy before the rally in Q4 due to its strong fundamentals and consistent demand. Avalanche (AVAX) Rebuilds Momentum Ahead of Q4 Rotation After weeks of trading sideways, Avalanche is regaining strength, backed by improving technicals and on-chain stability. Historically, AVAX has done well toward the end of the year, and that trend may repeat itself as sentiment improves. The Decentralized Autonomous Treasuries (DATs) narrative has brought a new enthusiasm to the Avalanche ecosystem. AVAX regained $20.7 and is consolidating above the Bollinger mid-band, where RSI is headed for 45. Open interest has fallen to $507 million, the lowest it’s been in three months, which indicates a cleaner market with fewer levers. This configuration raises the chances of having a sustainable uptrend. If AVAX trades above $19.7, then the next resistance levels are $26 and $28. Source: X Conclusion Ethereum and Chainlink continue to show resilience and hold strong technical points. Their ability to hold key levels is allowing the maintenance of overall market sentiment stability in anticipation of the expected Q4 rotation. Hyperliquid, Avalanche, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are currently attracting more capital as investors position themselves for the next phase of market growth. With the early accumulation phase and solid fundamentals, these projects are among the best altcoins to buy before Q4 inflows accelerate.

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/market-expert-to-xrp-holders-this-is-not-real-life-heres-why/,"Levi Rietveld of Crypto Crusaders has recently shared his excitement for XRP’s future. In a new video, he discussed the latest geopolitical developments between the U.S. and China, emphasizing how these shifts could signal a reversal for digital assets such as XRP. His remarks came after President Donald Trump announced that Chinese President Xi Jinping was open to a new trade deal. Rietveld reminded viewers that only a week earlier, markets had reacted sharply to news of Trump’s plan to impose a 100% tariff on China. He noted that this move had “eviscerated” the entire crypto market and that the effects of that announcement were still visible today. Bitcoin, which had reached an all-time high of $126,000 before the sell-off, and XRP fell below $2 for the first time since June and have yet to regain their prior levels. This Is Not Real Life #XRP pic.twitter.com/8uhpocmYB1 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) October 20, 2025 Reversal Momentum Gaining Strength According to Rietveld, the damage from the tariff announcement remains factored into prices, but the recent softening in tone from both leaders could quickly change that. He suggested that the market has room to rebound as assets have not fully recovered. His assessment positions the current environment as one of potential recovery rather than ongoing weakness. The shift in rhetoric between the U.S. and China may restore confidence that had recently been shaken. Investors and traders who had taken a cautious stance are now closely watching for any policy progress that might validate Rietveld’s outlook. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Institutional Participation on the Horizon Rietveld also noted that “institutions are getting ready to open up and go into crypto en masse,” a statement that adds further optimism to his analysis. Institutional entry has long been a defining factor for sustained growth and legitimacy within the digital asset market. A renewed inflow of institutional capital could amplify momentum in leading cryptocurrencies such as XRP, particularly if market conditions stabilize after the recent geopolitical turbulence. Rietveld’s outlook reflects a belief that sentiment is shifting from uncertainty toward opportunity. XRP could benefit strongly from renewed investor confidence once conditions normalize. If the trade environment improves and institutional activity increases, the digital asset could kickstart the broader market rebound Rietveld anticipates.

Further caution prevailed ahead of key U.S. inflation data and next week’s Fed policy meeting. Gold prices fell to around $4,080 per ounce on Thursday, extending its decline for a third straight session amid continued selling pressure after repeatedly hitting record highs in recent weeks. Singapore's annual inflation rate edged up to 0.7% in September 2025, picking up from a more than four-year low of 0.5% in the previous month and slightly above market expectations of 0.6%. Japan ( NKY:IND ) fell 1.42% dropped 1.3% to below 48,700 while the broader Topix Index fell 0.6% to 3,245 on Thursday. The Japanese yen weakened past 152 per dollar on Thursday, nearing eight-month lows, amid growing speculation that new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will unveil a large-scale stimulus package as early as next month. In Japan, investors weighed the policy outlook amid speculation that new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is preparing a major stimulus package exceeding last year’s 13.9 trillion yen. Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan is widely anticipated to keep rates unchanged next week, with markets now projecting the next hike in January. China ( SHCOMP ) fell 0.83% to below 3,890 while the Shenzhen Component dropped 1.3% to 12,830 on Thursday, marking a second straight session of losses as trade and policy uncertainties dampened sentiment, and the offshore yuan Hong Kong ( HSI ) fell 0.25% to 25,601 on Thursday morning, down for the second day after Wall Street weakened overnight. Investors also turned cautious ahead of Hong Kong’s September inflation data due later today. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.86% to 85,196 in morning trade on Thursday, extending gains from the Muhurat ""special"" trading day on Tuesday and hitting its highest level since September 26, 2024, buoyed by renewed foreign inflows. Meanwhile, the Nifty 50 climbed above the milestone 26,000 mark for the first time since September 30, 2024. The Indian rupee traded around 87.7 per USD, holding near a one-month-high, as markets returned from a two-day break to signs of improving US–India trade ties. Indian state refiners are reviewing their Russian oil trade documents to ensure that no supplies are sourced directly from Rosneft and Lukoil, following U.S. sanctions imposed on both companies, a source with direct knowledge told Reuters on Wednesday. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.03% to around 9,000 in Thursday morning trade, extending losses from the previous session, dragged down by mining and tech stocks. The Australian dollar In the U.S. on Wednesday, all three major indexes ended lower following reports that the White House may restrict exports to China involving US software. President Donald Trump later said his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping is “scheduled,” easing some tension over US-China ties.

However, we are holding Bitcoin while shorting MicroStrategy. It was an arbitrage strategy,” Chanos said in an interview. The renowned investor argued that he found it unreasonable that shares of companies holding Bitcoin treasury were trading at a high premium compared to the value of the Bitcoin they held: “It's not rational for investors to see companies holding Bitcoin holdings generate a premium on their shares solely because of this. MicroStrategy is the most well-known example, but we believe investors who want to buy Bitcoin should buy it at $1, not $1.40.” Related News: Critical Date Set for Altcoin Project That Vitalik Buterin Invested In Chanos also noted that MicroStrategy’s premium to net asset value (NAV) ratio fell from 1.9 to 1.4, while other companies with similar structures fell below 1.0: “MicroStrategy is still holding at 1.4, but that gap will close over time.
