Dogecoin led the entire market in inflows, outperforming even Bitcoin in the past week. This momentum has introduced a compelling shift in Dogecoin’s technical outlook, particularly with the Bollinger Bands on the DOGE/BTC chart. This interesting outlook was highlighted by crypto analyst Tony Severino, who pointed out that the Bollinger Bands have tightened to a degree not seen in years. In fact, Severino notes that the bands are now tighter than they were before Dogecoin’s rally in 2021. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Squeeze To Tightest Level Bollinger Bands are widely used technical indicators that mark price volatility boundaries. When the bands narrow, it generally signals low volatility. On the other hand, widening bands indicate high volatility. A squeeze, where the bands move closer together, suggests that the asset is trading within a tight range. In the case of Dogecoin, Severino’s observation notes that the DOGE/BTC Bollinger Bands are now closer than they’ve ever been on the monthly timeframe. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes 12 Weeks Of Bottom Formation, Analyst Says Don’t Aim Lower Than $4,900 ATH The last the Bollinger bands were at such a squeeze was just before the 2021 rally, which saw the meme coin surge exponentially during the meme coin craze. Going by the history of the Dogecoin-Bitcoin pair, if the outcome plays out like its previous price action, Dogecoin could be on the cusp of a strong rally in the coming months that could even lead to more returns than the 2024 rally. DOGE Breakout From Three-Year Channel As noted earlier, Dogecoin’s rally over the past few days has been impressive. Particularly, Dogecoin went on a 72% rally to peak at $0.176, its highest point in over six months. This upward momentum allowed Dogecoin to break out of a three-year-long channel pattern on the price chart defined by a downward-sloping upper trendline dating back to the 2021 high. This breakout is significant, as it marks Dogecoin’s move beyond a key resistance level that had contained its growth since the 2021 peak. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To New ATH Soon? Analyst Who Called $72,000 Surge Reveals What Needs To Happen The likelihood of a Dogecoin rally in the upcoming months has increased massively due to this breakout, although there remains a possibility of a retest. According to a crypto analyst on social media platform X, $2 is a potential peak target if the momentum holds. However, it is important to note that several resistance levels lie between the current price and this ambitious target. Two examples of notable resistance levels are the 2024 high of $0.22 and the all-time high of $0.7316. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at $0.1585, which means it has reversed by about 10% from $0.176 to retest the channel breakout.

Despite the impressive BTC price hike, interest in the cryptocurrency is not picking up as Google searches remained flat. Related Reading: Cardano To Soar 22X? Analyst Sees Opportunity Despite On-Chain Decline Bitcoin Nears All-Time High Bitcoin still performed well last October 2024 despite experiencing a slight decrease in price, falling below $71,000 to $70,800 and failing to meet investors’ expectations of the coin hitting the $73,700 mark. Despite the dip, it has been a good month for BTC because its performance nearly reached an all-time high. Records showed that October has always been a pivotal month for Bitcoin to gain momentum for a price upsurge. According to Lookonchain, the cryptocurrency consistently obtained significant gains in October, a recurring trend since 2013. Last year, Bitcoin’s October rally brought a 28% gain for the coin which according to analysts paved the way to a five-month price upswing. During the bull run, BTC started at $26,965 and gradually gained momentum over the succeeding months, breaching the $73,000 barrier in March 2024. Will BTC repeat the same price movement as last year? A price rally could unfold as October 2024 ends. Interesting Phenomenon Bitcoin might be performing well and nearly hitting an all-time high, but an analysts noted a bizarre phenomenon. Analysts remarked that BTC is near its record high, but its online mentions are falling behind, saying, Google searches for Bitcoin remained notably low. It could mean that there is little retail participation despite the price upsurge. According to AltIndex, the cryptocurrency’s score at Google Trend is 37 out of 100, indicating that only a small number of people are searching for Bitcoin on the search engine Google. Related Reading: Analyst Eyes $6,000 For Ethereum As Key Support Level Emerges – Details BTC Bull Run And Google Searches Analysts said that there is a relationship between the previous Bitcoin bull run and Google Trends, adding that usually, bull runs coincide with an uptick in BTC search volume. Bitcoin’s bull run in 2017 serves as a prime example of this relationship. Analysts explained that during the said price rally, Bitcoin went up about $20,000 while its Google Trends score reached 80 out of 100. A trend that analysts have also seen during BTC’s bull run in the late 2020 to 2021. Historically, BTC price rallies occurred simultaneously with significant search interest on Google, something that is not happening yet at the moment. Would the search volume in Google remain a key indicator of BTC’s price movement? It is something that investors and analysts will have to keep an eye on the upcoming months.

To better understand these cycles, a CryptoQuant analyst, using the pseudonym ‘datascope,’ has highlighted the relevance of the UTXO Block Profit/Loss (P/L) Count Ratio Model. This tool offers unique insights into the balance of profitability and losses among Bitcoin market participants, serving as a lens to examine potential price reversals. By focusing on various moving averages, this model tracks price fluctuations and shows how profitability shifts within the market over time, offering clues about when new market peaks might form. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Bull Market Just Beginning? Leveraged Bets Suggest Big Moves Are Coming Predicting Market Peaks Through Profit And Loss Ratios Datascope’s analysis highlights the significance of short, medium, and long-term trends captured by 7-day, 30-day, and 365-day moving averages. This multi-perspective approach is valuable for long-term investors and short-term traders, as it distinguishes between shifts impacting immediate market movements and those affecting longer-term cycles. The model demonstrates that changes in the profitability ratio are critical for gauging market sentiment and potential price movements. As Datascope explains, a decrease in overall profitability ratios suggests that short- and medium-term trading strategies may now be more practical, responding to a market less defined by extreme long-term price swings. One of the key findings from the UTXO P/L model is the behavior of the 30-day profit and loss ratio relative to the 365-day moving average. Datascope noted that when the 30-day ratio rises above the 365-day average, it could signal a new price peak. In simple terms, crossing short- and long-term profitability lines indicates that investor sentiment is shifting towards more profitable conditions. Price increases have historically followed this occurrence as optimism fuels further buying pressure. For instance, the analyst pointed out that while economic conditions varied between 2021 and 2022, similar trends were observed in the model during both years, particularly in how the profit and loss ratio used the annual moving average as a resistance line. Datascope suggests that if the profit and loss metrics consistently stay above the annual average, Bitcoin may be on track to establish new highs.

Even though the platform promotes blockchain interoperability, a feature needed in the age of increasing fragmentation, DOT prices have failed to inspire bulls. This state of affairs on price charts reflects the general trend across the board, especially in leading smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Polkadot Treasury Reserves Down To All-Time Lows Unyielding bears have been forcing prices lower over the months since DOT rose to around $10 in Q1 2024, depleting the Polkadot Treasury Reserves. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To New ATH Soon? Analyst Who Called $72,000 Surge Reveals What Needs To Happen In early November, one observer on X said they stood at all-time lows. However, it could get worse for Polkadot should the bears of Q3 2024 flow back, forcing prices below local support levels. The daily chart shows that DOT has critical support at around $3.8. This level marks September and October lows. On the other hand, the coin is facing strong liquidation pressure at $4.6 and $5. As the coin ranges, the direction of the breakout could shape the short—to medium-term trend but also impact the Polkadot Treasury. A lot depends on whether DOT prices will recover, which will, in turn, help the Polkadot Treasury reserves recover. Technically, prices play a big role. When bulls take over, the reserve, denominated in DOT, increases in USD terms, easing pressure on the team. Policy Intervention To Boost Funds To further increase inflows into the Treasury Reserves, the Polkadot community passed a policy to reduce inflation. Specifically, the community voted to drop DOT annual inflation from 10% to 8%. With low inflation and sustained on-chain demand, DOT prices may find support. Additionally, 15% of staking rewards distributed from stakers will be moved to the Treasury. Related Reading: Bitcoin Open Interest Reduced By $2.1 Billion In 24 Hours – Time For Spot To Push The Price? The analyst predicts these changes could boost the Treasury by adding 1.5 million DOT. This will be the much-needed infusion of funds that may increase the Treasury Reserves after months of low income. The team could build better and even strike quality partnerships, improving the blockchain’s ecosystem. Based on H1 2024 data, the team spent most on outreach, while nearly 27% went to development. The rest was split between funding research, operations, talent, and the economy. Given the valuation in the year’s first half, they spent $87 million, or around 11 million DOT, in total.

Liquidation Data At A Glance Although BTC is trading close to its all-time high (ATH) value of $73,737, yesterday’s quick drop in price cast doubts on whether the top digital asset will be able to record a new ATH. Related Reading: Bitcoin Makes ATH Against Euro Due To Change In Dollar Strength, Details Inside According to CoinGlass data from the crypto liquidations tracker, more than $296 million of active positions were liquidated in the last 24 hours. Nearly 77% were long positions, indicating that traders were largely betting on BTC’s continued upward momentum. Binance saw the most liquidations at $124 million, followed by OKX with $74 million and Bybit with $65 million. In digital assets, Bitcoin led with over $97 million worth of positions liquidated, followed by Ethereum (ETH) at $47 million, and Solana at nearly $17 million. With yesterday’s slump, the total crypto market cap has shrunk by about 3.5%, currently valued at $2.48 trillion. It is worth noting that although BTC is close to its ATH, the total crypto market cap is still considerably far from its ATH of $2.98 trillion recorded in November 2021. The gap between BTC’s performance and the overall market cap suggests that altcoins have not kept pace with BTC’s recent gains, contributing to the disparity. This could also indicate a cautious investor sentiment, favoring BTC over altcoins during uncertain periods. At the same time, it suggests that there is still a lot of room for altcoins to grow, which could tempt some more risk-seeking investors to accumulate altcoins in hopes of extraordinary gains relative to BTC. That said, Bitcoin dominance – a metric that gauges the proportion of the overall crypto market cap commanded by BTC – is steadily climbing toward 60%. A higher BTC dominance could spell disaster for altcoins already trailing BTC in price action. Can Bitcoin Still Hit ATH? The question on the minds of crypto enthusiasts is whether BTC will achieve a new ATH during this rally. The answer is not straightforward. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Active Addresses Signals Golden Cross—What Next For BTC? Factors supporting a potential new ATH include the increased likelihood of pro-crypto US presidential candidate Donald Trump winning the election, the effects of BTC halving, increased inflows to BTC exchange-traded funds (ETF), and a low interest rate environment. On the contrary, sentiment indicators like the Fear and Greed Index suggest the market is still in a ‘greed’ phase, hinting that there could be more pain for the market before the next leg up. Regardless of the outcome, the crypto market will likely remain volatile in the coming days. However, long-term BTC holders do not appear fazed by this prospect, as profit-taking remained relatively muted when the digital asset crossed $71,000. At press time, BTC trades at $71,524, up a modest 0.6% in the past 24 hours, with a reported market cap of $1.41 trillion.

Some market watchers suggested the cryptocurrency will pull some “big moves” toward a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: Bitcoin Faces Fifth Consecutive Rejection At $72,000, Is Another Correction Coming? SUI Recovers From Halloween’s Correction As October ended, the crypto market saw a spooky correction led by Bitcoin’s drop below the $70,000 mark. Most cryptocurrencies experienced a significant retrace, with Ethereum and Solana bleeding around 5%. SUI, the native token of the Sui Network, joined the rest of the market and declined by 4%, losing its recently recovered $2 support. The cryptocurrency has been one of the best-performing tokens in the past few months, outperforming most of the market during Q3. Moreover, it recorded a 25% rise toward its latest $2.35 ATH two weeks ago. Following its rally to its ATH, SUI’s price faced an 18.5% correction, making investors and analysts forecast a longer consolidation time for the token. Earlier this week, the token followed BTC’s surge and eyed the $2.15 zone, which previously propelled the price toward its latest ATH. Nonetheless, the token reached the lower levels of the $1.90 support zone on Friday morning amid the market retrace. Today, SUI surged 9.3% from its $1.92 daily low to hit the $2.10 mark before retracing to $2.07. Some analysts consider the cryptocurrency is gearing up to “put in a big move” following the correction. Is A Retest Of The $2.35 ATH Looming? Analyst AMCrypto pointed out that SUI’s recent performance could target a breakout from a bull flag formation. Per the chart, the cryptocurrency displays this bullish pattern in the three-day chart, with the breakout target sitting at $2.05. The analyst stated that if SUI successfully breaks above the upper trendline, “it’ll pump towards its previous ATH.” Meanwhile, crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa proposed two short-term outcomes for the token. Sherpa considers the cryptocurrency will test the ATH zone and pull back to the current levels at least once more in the coming weeks. He indicated the price could drop to $1.65 if it fails to hold the $2 support. However, it could also bounce from this level after the retrace and rally toward a new ATH of around $2.7 by year-end. Sherpa previously suggested that tokens with a strong September performance still have “a bit more pullback to go” with “plenty of bounces” before resuming their run.

Analyst Michaël van de Poppe noted that most altcoins, including SUI, were in a correction period and explained how its retest of the $1.90-$2 support is “crucial for further upward momentum.” As of this writing, SUI is trading at $2.05, a 3.5% increase in the last 24 hours.

Total Tether Assets Reach All-Time High Conducted by accounting firm BDO, the report highlights Tether’s growth, with a net profit of $2.5 billion for Q3, contributing to a consolidated profit of $7.7 billion for the first nine months of 2024. This marks a significant achievement for the company, with total assets reaching an all-time high of $134.4 billion. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Slides Below $70,000: These Are The Key Reasons Another notable accomplishment in the report was the expansion of Tether’s stablecoin supply, which now exceeds $120 billion in circulation. This represents a 30% increase since the beginning of the year and reflects the growing global demand for Tether’s stablecoin, USDT. Tether’s reserves are now at over $105 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including $102.5 billion in direct and indirect exposures to US Treasury bills (T-Bills). If categorized as a country, the stablecoin company would rank among the top 18 holders of US Treasuries globally, surpassing nations like Germany and Australia. CEO Ardoino Criticizes ‘Inclusion Washing’ By Other Firms CEO Paolo Ardoino emphasized the company’s dedication to transparency and responsible risk management, stating “Tether’s performance in Q3 showcases our relentless commitment to liquidity and financial stability,” pointing to the increase in the reserve buffer to over $6 billion and investments made through Tether Investments. The Tether CEO revealed that these investments span various sectors, including renewable energy, Bitcoin mining, artificial intelligence (AI), telecommunications, and education. In a recent social media post on X (formerly Twitter), Ardoino also highlighted the importance of USDT in promoting financial inclusion, particularly in developing countries. He noted that a significant portion of USDT’s usage is concentrated in regions with limited traditional banking services. “USDt is the digital dollar for hundreds of millions of people who the banking industry has left behind,” Ardoino explained, underscoring the stablecoin’s role in providing financial access to “underserved populations.” Related Reading: BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Reaches 2% Of Total BTC Supply Amid Record Inflows Despite progress, Ardoino acknowledged that a substantial portion of the global population—approximately 3 billion people—still lacks access to basic financial services. Ardoino further criticized the notion of “financial inclusion washing,” where companies make grand claims about enhancing financial access without delivering tangible results. In contrast, the CEO said Tether aims to lead the charge toward “a more inclusive financial ecosystem.” At the time of writing, the market’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was trading at $69,390, having lost its consolidation above the key $70,000 resistance level while recording a 1.2% drop in price over the past 24 hours.

Gox, which was once the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally before its shutdown in 2014, recently transferred 500 Bitcoin (worth roughly over $34 million) to two unidentified wallets. This transaction, conducted early Friday, marked the first transfer from the defunct exchange since late September of this year.

However, past transfers from Mt. Gox wallets have often signaled upcoming repayments to creditors, who have been awaiting compensation since the platform’s collapse. These prior distributions were typically facilitated through major crypto exchange platforms such as Bitstamp and Kraken. Currently, Mt. Gox retains a substantial holding of 44,905 BTC, valued at more than $3 billion. This recent transfer follows an October announcement by Mt. Gox that extended its repayment deadline from October 31, 2024, to October 31, 2025. Bitcoin Price Performance Following The Transfer Following the recorded transfer from Mt.Gox, Bitcoin’s price initially surged, reaching a 24-hour high of $71,500 in the early hours of Friday. However, a correction has followed, with Bitcoin now trading down by 1.5%, settling at a price of $69,450, at the time of writing. This dip is seen as a disappointment to investors, especially as Bitcoin recently experienced an optimistic rally that nearly pushed it above its all-time high of $73,737 set in March 2024. Despite the slight downturn, Bitcoin’s market fundamentals remain resilient. A recent analysis by a CryptoQuant analyst highlights that significant buying pressure is emerging from Binance futures whales, who are reportedly driving much of Bitcoin’s recent gains.
