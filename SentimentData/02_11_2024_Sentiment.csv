Dogecoin led the entire market in inflows, outperforming even Bitcoin in the past week. This momentum has introduced a compelling shift in Dogecoin’s technical outlook, particularly with the Bollinger Bands on the DOGE/BTC chart. This interesting outlook was highlighted by crypto analyst Tony Severino, who pointed out that the Bollinger Bands have tightened to a degree not seen in years. In fact, Severino notes that the bands are now tighter than they were before Dogecoin’s rally in 2021. Dogecoin Bollinger Bands Squeeze To Tightest Level Bollinger Bands are widely used technical indicators that mark price volatility boundaries. When the bands narrow, it generally signals low volatility. On the other hand, widening bands indicate high volatility. A squeeze, where the bands move closer together, suggests that the asset is trading within a tight range. In the case of Dogecoin, Severino’s observation notes that the DOGE/BTC Bollinger Bands are now closer than they’ve ever been on the monthly timeframe. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Completes 12 Weeks Of Bottom Formation, Analyst Says Don’t Aim Lower Than $4,900 ATH The last the Bollinger bands were at such a squeeze was just before the 2021 rally, which saw the meme coin surge exponentially during the meme coin craze. Going by the history of the Dogecoin-Bitcoin pair, if the outcome plays out like its previous price action, Dogecoin could be on the cusp of a strong rally in the coming months that could even lead to more returns than the 2024 rally. DOGE Breakout From Three-Year Channel As noted earlier, Dogecoin’s rally over the past few days has been impressive. Particularly, Dogecoin went on a 72% rally to peak at $0.176, its highest point in over six months. This upward momentum allowed Dogecoin to break out of a three-year-long channel pattern on the price chart defined by a downward-sloping upper trendline dating back to the 2021 high. This breakout is significant, as it marks Dogecoin’s move beyond a key resistance level that had contained its growth since the 2021 peak. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To New ATH Soon? Analyst Who Called $72,000 Surge Reveals What Needs To Happen The likelihood of a Dogecoin rally in the upcoming months has increased massively due to this breakout, although there remains a possibility of a retest. According to a crypto analyst on social media platform X, $2 is a potential peak target if the momentum holds. However, it is important to note that several resistance levels lie between the current price and this ambitious target. Two examples of notable resistance levels are the 2024 high of $0.22 and the all-time high of $0.7316. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at $0.1585, which means it has reversed by about 10% from $0.176 to retest the channel breakout.

Despite the impressive BTC price hike, interest in the cryptocurrency is not picking up as Google searches remained flat. Related Reading: Cardano To Soar 22X? Analyst Sees Opportunity Despite On-Chain Decline Bitcoin Nears All-Time High Bitcoin still performed well last October 2024 despite experiencing a slight decrease in price, falling below $71,000 to $70,800 and failing to meet investors’ expectations of the coin hitting the $73,700 mark. Despite the dip, it has been a good month for BTC because its performance nearly reached an all-time high. Records showed that October has always been a pivotal month for Bitcoin to gain momentum for a price upsurge. According to Lookonchain, the cryptocurrency consistently obtained significant gains in October, a recurring trend since 2013. Last year, Bitcoin’s October rally brought a 28% gain for the coin which according to analysts paved the way to a five-month price upswing. During the bull run, BTC started at $26,965 and gradually gained momentum over the succeeding months, breaching the $73,000 barrier in March 2024. Will BTC repeat the same price movement as last year? A price rally could unfold as October 2024 ends. Interesting Phenomenon Bitcoin might be performing well and nearly hitting an all-time high, but an analysts noted a bizarre phenomenon. Analysts remarked that BTC is near its record high, but its online mentions are falling behind, saying, Google searches for Bitcoin remained notably low. It could mean that there is little retail participation despite the price upsurge. According to AltIndex, the cryptocurrency’s score at Google Trend is 37 out of 100, indicating that only a small number of people are searching for Bitcoin on the search engine Google. Related Reading: Analyst Eyes $6,000 For Ethereum As Key Support Level Emerges – Details BTC Bull Run And Google Searches Analysts said that there is a relationship between the previous Bitcoin bull run and Google Trends, adding that usually, bull runs coincide with an uptick in BTC search volume. Bitcoin’s bull run in 2017 serves as a prime example of this relationship. Analysts explained that during the said price rally, Bitcoin went up about $20,000 while its Google Trends score reached 80 out of 100. A trend that analysts have also seen during BTC’s bull run in the late 2020 to 2021. Historically, BTC price rallies occurred simultaneously with significant search interest on Google, something that is not happening yet at the moment. Would the search volume in Google remain a key indicator of BTC’s price movement? It is something that investors and analysts will have to keep an eye on the upcoming months.
