Helium operates an IoT network using hotspot technology, while Raydium offers a fast trading system through Solana’s DEX, both aiming to establish strong digital environments. However, both have encountered issues with consistent network functionality and market stability. In this context, BlockDAG (BDAG) distinguishes itself with a stable and resilient framework that incorporates fault tolerance as a fundamental feature. This focus on redundancy and constant operational capability allows developers and users to engage and create on the platform uninterrupted, significantly contributing to its success in presales. Helium: Advancing Decentralized IoT Connectivity Founded by Amir Haleem, Shawn Fanning, and Sean Carey in 2012, Helium launched its mainnet in 2019, aiming to revolutionize IoT connectivity through a decentralized network. The network expanded rapidly by incentivizing hotspot installations. In May 2023, Helium introduced a mobile plan at $20 monthly, greatly increasing user engagement. By December 2023, this service generated about 90% of the network’s revenue. Despite its growth, Helium’s native token, HNT, saw significant price changes. It grew by 124% in market cap to $1.3 billion and by 119% in price to $7.54 in Q3 2024. As of March 28, 2025, the price has fallen to $3.37, a steep drop from its peak of $48.80. Yet, Helium’s network expansion continues, driven by strategic alliances and global expansion efforts. Raydium: Leading the Charge in Solana’s Decentralized Trading Raydium was introduced in early 2021 as a DEX and AMM on the Solana blockchain, leveraging the blockchain’s capacity for high-speed, cost-effective transactions. This capability has drawn users looking for efficient trading options. By early 2024, weekly trade volumes on Raydium were between $1 and $2 billion, peaking at $12 billion later that year, indicating swift growth. As of March 28, 2025, Raydium’s token, RAY, is valued at $2.00, with a trading volume of about $56.99 million over 24 hours and a market cap of approximately $581.66 million. This represents 60.7% of all trading volume on Solana’s DEXes. Raydium’s success can be attributed to its deep liquidity, strategic partnerships, and ongoing development in the decentralized finance sector, establishing it as a prominent DEX within the Solana ecosystem. BlockDAG’s Dependable Framework for Continuous Uptime BlockDAG stands out among blockchain platforms with its dedicated focus on uptime and consistent network reliability. Its infrastructure is specifically designed to be fault-tolerant, equipped to handle both expected and unexpected disruptions effectively. The system’s strength comes from its geographically distributed nodes and built-in redundancy, ensuring the network stays active even if some nodes or regions fail. The network’s design incorporates multiple data centers globally, which facilitates continuous operations by shifting loads and processing to regions unaffected by any issues. This strategic infrastructure management helps avoid performance bottlenecks and reduces potential downtime, offering a reliable and stable environment for both users and developers. The effectiveness of this infrastructure has significantly contributed to the success of BlockDAG’s presale, raising $209.5 million and distributing over 19 billion coins so far. Currently priced at $0.0248 in its 27th batch, the ROI from the first batch has soared to 2,380%. This robust system not only showcases technical prowess but also builds trust in its capability for sustained performance. With a focus on maintaining network stability, BlockDAG remains a trusted platform for uninterrupted development and operation, essential as it scales and continues to attract more engagement. BlockDAG’s Solid Infrastructure: Key to Enduring Trust and Stability While network dependability is crucial for any blockchain initiative, it is particularly vital for those looking to secure long-term trust from users. Both Helium’s IoT network and Raydium’s decentralized trading platform have significantly impacted their respective fields, yet they have faced issues with infrastructure resilience and market stability. BlockDAG differentiates itself by prioritizing fault tolerance and redundancy, crucial features that ensure it remains robust against disruptions. This commitment not only builds user confidence but also drives consistent growth, evident from its strong crypto presale achievements. As blockchain technologies progress, the value of BlockDAG’s relentless focus on continuous uptime becomes increasingly pivotal, underscoring its potential for sustained success.

He sees it as political posturing and a way to woo crypto voters ahead of the 2026 midterms while doing the bare minimum to keep inflation under control. In an exclusive interview with Cryptopolitan, Arthur Hayes—CIO of Maelstrom, co-founder of BitMEX and one of the most outspoken figures in the crypto world—doesn’t mince words when it comes to the future of BTC and all the things that are weighing it down. With US-China tensions rising and tariffs making a comeback , could Bitcoin become a weapon in the new Cold War? Let’s dig in more with Hayes who thinks China might already be ahead in the BTC accumulation race. Bitcoin’s Wall Street takeover? With Bitcoin ETFs, institutional adoption, and political backing, many are celebrating what seems like the asset’s golden era. However, Hayes sees the flip side, warning that this mainstreaming could strip BTC of its rebel DNA and turn it into just another Wall Street asset. He believes that “Bitcoin is a bearer asset with a finite supply that cannot be altered by government or central bank diktat. It is the complete opposite of any TradFi asset which, even if it is in finite supply like equities, relies on the legal fiction woven by governments and enforced by men with guns.” We asked him if big banks would kill off stablecoin issuers like Tether or if regulators could shut down all stablecoins, bank-issued or not. He stood firm on Tether’s survival and highlighted that Tether is too big to kill because a disorderly unwind of their hundreds of billions of dollars worth of US Treasury securities would roil the market. “Tether is mostly used by non-Americans, US bank will issue a stablecoin in its first instance to service US persons. Therefore, Tether’s dominance will not be challenged,” said Hayes. Is Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve a smart move or a gimmick? Bitcoin and other top altcoins got an official call to be included in a government reserve. We asked Arthur whether this is the first step toward a Bitcoin-backed financial system or just political theater. He pointed out that “Trump and the Republican party have a tough mid-term election coming up in 2026. Trump needs to keep crypto investors on side so they show up with campaign donations and at the ballot box.” He added “But on the other hand, Trump can’t have inflation running wild, so wanton money printing, which would send Bitcoin quickly to new all-time highs, cannot be pursued because inflation harms all Americans. Trump will do the minimum necessary to gain the support of crypto investors.” President Trump Travels to Texas. Taken on January 12, 2021. Photo by Trump White House Archived via Flickr. Hayes believes China’s local governments have been mining Bitcoin for years and may already be ahead in accumulating reserves . He said that “the roughly 200,000 Bitcoin the US government seized or stole from individuals is what is going into the reserve. It is very possible that the Chinese government holds more Bitcoin than that.” Bitcoin as a trade war weapon? With rising US-China tensions and the return of aggressive tariffs, Bitcoin could become a strategic tool for countries to bypass financial sanctions and tariffs. We asked Arthur if we could see governments weaponizing BTC in global trade. He thinks Bitcoin is becoming a key tool for economic resistance. “Bitcoin will become the only way that balkanized economic blocs can be financially connected. In the near future, the major economic blocs will begin blocking the ability for capital to flow freely outside of their borders. At that point, Bitcoin, given that anyone with an internet connection can use it, will be the only way that citizens from different blocs can financially interact with each other,” he added. If global supply chains get disrupted again due to tariffs and economic nationalism, could that push businesses and individuals toward Bitcoin as a borderless asset? Maelstrom CIO suggested that “the balkanization of trade and finance is inflationary as every country must replicate production. The increase in productive capacity cannot be funded out of savings alone; therefore, fiat money printing will be used to finance this build out.” “Bitcoin benefits as the amount of global fiat credit expands. That is how Bitcoin benefits in a global trade war,” he further added. We’ve seen El Salvador going big on BTC, but they’re small. Which major nation do you think will be the first to shift a major part of their reserves into Bitcoin? Despite El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment, Hayes doubts any major economy will make Bitcoin its primary reserve asset. “It doesn’t make any sense for a government to ditch the privilege of issuing its own currency by fiat.” Arthur Hayes and Changpeng Zhao. Photo by Maelstrom via X. Are meme coins the real central bank killers? Forget BTC and ETH, meme coins are moving faster and creating more liquidity than some national currencies. Meanwhile, we have also seen more scams and hacks in the shadow of the meme coins explosion. Would it be possible to see a future where such coins disrupt fiat systems more than BTC? We asked Hayes, who frequently places his bets on social media. He indicated that “Meme coins will redirect investment flows from investments deemed suitable by the elites, to whatever is hot in the metaverse.” However, he thinks that this will frustrate the ability of baby boomers to dump their financial assets on the youth because the youth would rather buy a meme coin than a stock. During the recent election season, the market saw Trump and Biden-themed coins explode overnight. I asked for Arthur Hayes’s take on political parties officially launching their meme cryptos to raise funds and influence voters. He sees the real meme coin wars heating up during the 2026 midterm elections. “They are the perfect campaign financing tool for young aspiring politicians facing off against the gerontocracy,” he stated While meme coins may be more popular, Hayes says governments have one undeniable advantage in pushing CBDCs. “Governments that are serious about CBDCs will mandate that taxes be paid in them. Given that you must pay your taxes or get shot in the head, they will gain adoption alongside or in spite of meme coins,” Hayes added. Crypto’s next Black Swan? Hayes made waves in 2023 when he predicted the banking crisis. We asked him what the next major crypto shock could be, and he pointed towards a world war. “The Europeans are now hell bent on gearing up for war given Trump wants to find a peaceful solution to the Ukraine/Russia war. What if there is a nuclear exchange between Europe (NATO) and Russia?” he stated. Arthur Hayes has said that AI would prefer Bitcoin because of its energy-backed nature. But let’s go deeper, what’s the wildest scenario you see where AI and crypto collide? He envisions a near future where AI agents control financial transactions, on and off-chain. Hayes mentioned that “Humans will rely on AI agents to conduct all of their financial transactions, which will exist all on-chain in the near future.” He added “ I’m talking about both native crypto and TradFi assets.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

XRP has been pivotal in reshaping global payments, while TAO has been revolutionizing the integration of AI with decentralized networks. BlockDAG (BDAG) , however, is setting the stage for a more expansive framework. It’s rolling out a roadmap filled with decentralized identity features, AI capabilities, and enhanced self-governance, all built on its unique DAG architecture. With a massive $209.5 million from its presale and a staggering 2,380% ROI from its first to twenty-seventh batches, BlockDAG is proving to be more than just a tool—it’s becoming a crucial part of the Web3 foundation. XRP: Its Journey and Market Performance Created by Ripple Labs in 2012, XRP was crafted to make cross-border payments faster and cheaper. It began by tackling the inefficiencies in the banking sector with its real-time settlement capabilities. Initially, XRP’s price was minimal, only fractions of a cent. However, it has seen dramatic swings driven by market trends and regulatory actions. As of March 28, 2025, its trading price is around $2.32. XRP has faced significant regulatory scrutiny, especially from a 2020 SEC lawsuit, which has influenced both its price and market standing. Despite these challenges, XRP remains a powerhouse in the crypto world, with its market cap securing it a spot among the top digital currencies. Its continued adoption for financial transactions by major institutions highlights its enduring utility and potential in the finance sector’s future. Bittensor (TAO): Initial Launch, Market Fluctuations, and Performance TAO, Bittensor’s token, debuted on March 6, 2023, at $93.40, focusing on democratizing machine learning through a decentralized network. This model encourages a collective approach to AI, fostering an accessible market for artificial intelligence innovations. Since its introduction, TAO has faced typical market volatility, peaking at $757.60 in December 2023 before settling at around $479.85 by January 29, 2025. This represents a notable increase from its initial price, offering substantial value to early participants despite market ups and downs. Bittensor’s integration of blockchain with machine learning continues to draw interest from both tech enthusiasts and the broader crypto community. This focus on decentralized and collective intelligence makes it a prominent player at the intersection of AI and blockchain technologies. BlockDAG’s Blueprint for Advanced Web3 Capabilities As blockchain technology evolves, the focus is shifting from merely enhancing transaction efficiency to completely transforming the digital backbone of society. BlockDAG is at the forefront of this transformation. With a remarkable $209.5 million gathered through its presale, driven purely by community support, BlockDAG demonstrates the power of collective enthusiasm to transcend mere market excitement. Currently, at Batch 27, the project has sold over 19 billion coins at $0.0248 each, achieving an impressive 2,380% ROI since Batch 1. However, this is just the start for BlockDAG. The future roadmap, stretching beyond 2026, is ambitious: it includes integration with AI systems, development of decentralized identity solutions, and establishment of autonomous digital communities. These aren’t just plans—they are already incorporated into the architecture of BlockDAG. With a focus on user-centric features like account abstraction, zero-knowledge security, and adaptable smart contracts, BlockDAG is setting the stage for applications that extend well beyond traditional financial uses. Envision a world where personal identity is cryptographically yours and directly controlled, where decentralized AI agents use platforms like BlockDAG for transparent operations, and where governance systems are driven by the community according to codified rules. BlockDAG is crafting a vision of Web3 that reflects its potential to be built on principles of speed, durability, and trust. As the Beta Testnet launches and the Mainnet rollout nears, the future is not just on the horizon—it is actively being shaped. Pioneering the Next Generation of Blockchain Foundations The evolution of blockchain is leading to projects that transcend short-term speculation. XRP revolutionized speed within traditional financial systems, and Bittensor pioneered the integration of AI with decentralization. BlockDAG, however, is planning even further ahead, focusing on an AI-driven ecosystem, decentralized personal identities, and governance led by its community. Its architecture is designed to support not just cryptocurrency transactions but also the broader functionalities that the next phase of Web3 demands. The substantial $209.5 million raised in crypto presale globally without the backing of early venture capital reflects a shift in user expectations—they seek not just quicker transactions but also greater autonomy, practicality, and ownership. BlockDAG is laying the groundwork for the Web3 infrastructure necessary for these advanced capabilities.

Yes, Optimism is projected to close up on $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Expert Analyzes Four Years of SEC Drama,https://timestabloid.com/are-xrp-holders-burnt-out-expert-analyzes-four-years-of-sec-drama/,"All Things XRP (@XRP_investing), a well-known XRP community member on X, recently highlighted a growing sentiment among long-term XRP holders: emotional fatigue. After years of legal battles and expectations of a major price surge, many investors are experiencing exhaustion rather than excitement. The prolonged legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been a defining factor in XRP’s trajectory. Since the lawsuit began, the belief that a favorable outcome would lead to a dramatic price increase was widespread. However, the market’s reaction did not align with those expectations. The End of the Lawsuit and Market Disillusionment All Things XRP drew attention to the fact that the conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC did not produce the anticipated market surge. While XRP experienced a surge, it only climbed by around 11% and has since retraced those gains. All Things XRP noted that there was a limited impact from U.S. relistings. He added that there is a lack of new capital inflows and a market already priced in the legal outcome. The result was disillusionment among investors. Many long-term XRP holders had been waiting for years under the assumption that regulatory clarity would be the catalyst for significant price appreciation. Instead, the market remained stagnant, and enthusiasm has waned. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Potential vs. Market Sentiment Despite the fatigue among retail investors, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. All Things XRP pointed out that the asset plays a key role in global finance. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) is used by financial institutions. The company has secured partnerships for CBDC initiatives , and the asset remains one of the most established cryptocurrencies. However, the contradiction persists. XRP has a clear use case and real-world adoption, yet it remains psychologically draining to hold. The Path Forward for XRP Holders All Things XRP noted that investor sentiment follows cycles, with emotional fatigue often signaling market reversals. However, he believes burnout is a signal. Historically, exhaustion and apathy come just before renewed momentum. While no surge is guaranteed, past trends suggest fatigue may lead to renewed interest. Many long-term XRP holders feel indifferent, and some have stepped away, yet institutional accumulation often occurs quietly during such phases. XRP’s speculative hype has faded, but its utility remains. As All Things XRP stated , “XRP’s story isn’t over—just evolving,” and if you’re still holding on, you’re part of a unique community. One expert recently pointed out that the digital asset should already be trading above $100 , and this could soon become a reality as excitement builds in the community again.

Despite broader market optimism, ETH continues to face significant downside pressure due to regulatory uncertainty and weakening demand from institutional investors. Why is Ethereum Price Going Down? Ethereum’s decline is primarily driven by growing skepticism surrounding regulatory developments in the United States. The nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC chair, initially seen as a positive move for crypto, has faced mounting opposition in Congress due to potential conflicts of interest. This uncertainty has raised concerns that pro-crypto policies—including Trump’s proposed inclusion of ETH in the Crypto Strategic Reserve— could face delays or outright rejection. Ethereum Price Analysis | March 30 As a result, traders appear to be offloading ETH in favor of Bitcoin, which is perceived as a safer store of value amid regulatory unpredictability. Additionally, liquidity in Ethereum’s spot market has declined 26% in the last 24 hours, reflecting weak buying support at the current ETH price levels. This combination of regulatory headwinds and shifting market dynamics has kept ETH trapped below $1,800. 12.3 Million Addresses at Risk as ETH Struggles to Attract Buyers Ethereum’s on-chain data trends reveals a looming bearish signal ahead. According to IntoTheBlock , millions ETH addresses would slip into losses if prices fall below $1,600. The latest data suggests that the largest accumulation zone for ETH holders sits between $1,596 and $1,790, with 8.73 million addresses holding a combined 3.61 million ETH in this range. Ethereum In/Out of The Money Data, March 30 | Source: IntoTheBlock If ETH breaks below $1,600, it could trigger a cascade of sell-offs, further deepening the downturn. The lack of significant buying interest at current levels suggests that traders are waiting for either a clear regulatory breakthrough or a deeper price correction before re-entering the market. Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to sustain price levels above $1,780 as investors shift capital to Bitcoin (BTC), which recently reclaimed the $84,000 mark. Investors appear to be positioning themselves in BTC as a hedge against uncertainty. If the sell-0ffs continue on Monday, ETH price could be at risk major downsizing if such a large number of wallets capitulate within a short period. ETH Price Forecast: Ethereum Risks Breakdown Below $1,750 as Momentum Weakens Ethereum price remains on shaky ground, trading at $1,808.82, as technical indicators flash warning signs of further downside risk. The daily chart reveals a sustained bearish trend, with price action struggling below key resistance levels. The ADX breakout at $2,212 suggests significant resistance, and ETH’s failure to reclaim this level signals that bullish momentum is lacking. ETH Price Forecast The MACD indicator paints a concerning picture, with the MACD line at -98.38 firmly below the signal line at -105.99. This suggests that downward momentum is still in control, weakening the case for a reversal. The declining histogram bars reinforce this bearish trend, showing that selling pressure remains dominant. However, a potential recovery scenario exists if ETH can reclaim $1,850 and flip it into support. This would signal a possible retest of $2,212, but bullish conviction is currently lacking. A drop below $1,754—the lower bound of current price action—could trigger liquidation cascades, pushing ETH toward the critical $1,600 support, where 12.3 million addresses risk falling into losses.

Bitcoin is bouncing near $85K, Ethereum’s teasing a breakout, and a new wave of altcoins is waking up fast. One name that recently turned heads? Aptos. The so-called “Solana killer” popped hard, showing off what it can do. Early adopters walked away grinning. But here’s the thing—most backers now are wondering if Aptos already shot its shot. Meanwhile, another project is creeping into the spotlight. Qubetics ($TICS) is stirring serious buzz as one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025, and this one might just change the game. Qubetics isn’t here to play copycat. While projects like Aptos focus on speed and scalability, Qubetics is going straight for the jugular—solving some of the biggest real-life headaches that’ve plagued crypto since day one. Its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet is exactly what the space needs. From freelancers to global brands, folks are finally getting the tools to handle crypto without needing to be some kinda tech wizard. That’s why analysts and community members are tagging Qubetics as one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025. Aptos (APT): The New Kid with Speed, But Is It Enough? Aptos came in hot. Launched by ex-Meta engineers, it promised to fix the mess others left behind. Using its Move programming language and lightning-fast TPS (transactions per second), Aptos aimed to knock Solana off its pedestal. After a strong start, APT soared past $9 and even touched $11. Folks were calling it the next-gen Layer 1 chain. The project locked down some major partnerships, too. From blockchain gaming to DeFi projects, Aptos tried grabbing a slice of every market. Binance and other big names jumped in, adding fuel to the fire. With a market cap north of $3 billion, Aptos ain’t small potatoes anymore. But here’s the kicker—after that huge pump, APT’s been sliding. Right now, it’s hovering around $9, struggling to reclaim those highs. Analysts predict it could revisit $7 if the market softens, or rip back to $12 if momentum returns. Still, the hype’s cooled off, and folks are asking if Aptos is really worth chasing anymore. What’s missing? Real-life application for everyday people. Aptos might be fast, but how many freelancers, small businesses, or average Joes are out here trying to code on Move or build dApps? That’s why the search for top cryptos to buy for 2025 is shifting toward projects like Qubetics that offer actual utility for normal folks. Qubetics ($TICS): The Top Crypto to Buy for 2025 with a Revolutionary Wallet Qubetics isn’t just another shiny token. It’s the project turning heads because it’s fixing what’s broken. The Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet isn’t some gimmick—it’s the real deal. Imagine being able to send, receive, and manage your crypto bag across multiple blockchains without losing sleep over private keys, bridges, or sketchy exchanges. Picture this: a Miami-based real estate agent closes deals with international clients. Payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDT? No problem. Qubetics’ wallet lets him manage it all from one place. No third-party risks, no BS. Or think about a freelance photographer in LA getting gigs from Paris, Dubai, and Tokyo. Every time a client pays in a random token, it’s a nightmare juggling different wallets and exchanges. Qubetics makes that mess disappear. Payments land instantly, assets swap seamlessly, and she can cash out whenever she wants. Even big-time brands are watching. E-commerce platforms, SaaS companies, and global remittance services see Qubetics as a solution to the tangled web of crypto payments. Cross-chain transactions without backend chaos? That’s the dream—and Qubetics is building it. No wonder it’s ranking high on every list of top cryptos to buy for 2025. Now, let’s talk numbers. The crypto presale is already deep into its 27th stage. Over 504 million tokens sold. More than 23,900 holders in the bag. $15.5 million raised—and counting. Right now, $TICS is sitting pretty at $0.1300 per token. Analysts are drooling over the possible returns. If $TICS hits $1 after the presale? That’s a wild 669% ROI. Smash through $5? You’re staring down 3,745%. $6 means a fat 4,514%. But here’s where it gets juicy—projections have $TICS landing between $10 and $15 after the mainnet launch. That’s a potential 7,591% to 11,437% ROI. Life-changing kinda money. With Qubetics solving real-world problems and those insane ROI predictions, it’s easy to see why $TICS is being crowned one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025. The presale is still open, but for how long? That window’s closing fast. Final Thoughts Sure, Aptos had its moment. It showed up, flexed its tech, and made early buyers some solid gains. But that ship might’ve sailed. Aptos is still around, but it’s facing the same challenge as every hyped project—what’s next? Speed’s cool, but utility wins the long game. Qubetics is where the smart money’s heading. It’s the top crypto to buy for 2025 because it’s making crypto usable for everyone. Freelancers, businesses, even regular folks trying to dodge banks and clunky payment apps—Qubetics is their answer. Add those ridiculous ROI projections, and it’s a no-brainer. Don’t sit around watching $TICS hit $10 or $15 while wondering what could’ve been. Grab your stack now at $0.1300 and ride this wave. ‘Cause by the time Qubetics launches its mainnet, folks’ll be wishing they jumped in earlier. Qubetics isn’t just one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025—it might just be the best bet of the year.

While present figures are largely underwhelming for ADA, investors are brimming with confidence for a strong reversal in the near future. Cardano Price Can Reach $2.5 In May According to pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Master Kenobi, Cardano price is exhibiting cyclical behavior. In a post on X , Master Kenobi notes that ADA’s consolidation in recent days mirrors its price action from Q3 of 2024. At the time, Cardano’s price suffered a steep correction in early August and endured a lengthy consolidation period before rallying. Presently, Cardano’s price is consolidating after the deep in early February that sent prices to $0.49. “ADA is currently in a consolidation phase that resembles its behavior from August-September 2024,” said Master Kenobi. “Since the dip on August 5, it hasn’t recorded a new low – just as it hasn’t now, following the dip on February 3.” According to Master Kenobi, a lengthy consolidation phase will be the precursor for an impressive rally for Cardano’s price. The analyst theorizes that the incoming rally will send Cardano to impressive levels in May. In the short term, analysts are eyeing ADA to hit $1 , citing rising whale activity and positive fundamentals. “If this pattern holds, May could bring a massive pump, potentially pushing the price toward $2.5,” said Master Kenobi. ADA Ripples With Bullish Activity At the moment, Cardano price is trading at $0.6646, a far cry from its all-time high of $3.10. Despite the lull in price action, the ecosystem is brimming with bullish activity for higher valuation. Investors have their eyes on $10 after ADA outperformed top S&P 500 companies in a strong show of resilience. Futhermore, increased whale activity in the space is signaling an impending rally for ADA as community sentiment reaches an all-time high. Analysts have opined that an ADA rally to $10 is not a crazy prediction, citing a slew of positive fundamentals for the network. However, pundits are urging investors to brace for multiple corrections in the march to reach a valuation of $10.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $4.66 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $14.78. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.656 Market cap $680,394,046.41 Trading volume $12,427,451.95 Circulating supply 1,037,116,227.14 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $0.6456 24-hour high $0.6631 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.89% 50-day SMA $0.7897 14-Day RSI 40.21 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-day SMA $0.971 Tezos price analysis: Will XTZ break the $0.674 barrier? TL;DR Breakdown XTZ has gained 1.28% in the last 24 hours. The coin’s immediate support is at $0.64. XTZ’s resistance is around $0.674. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ might retest $0.64 support level Tezos (XTZ) shows a mixed outlook on March 30. The price is below the 20-period SMA, suggesting bearish pressure. XTZ might retest $0.64 support level However, the MACD is slightly positive, which may hint at a potential short-term reversal. The RSI at 43.50 is neutral, approaching oversold territory. Support at $0.64 is key—if this holds, a small bounce could occur, but further downside remains possible if the support is broken. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: XTZ shows weak bearish momentum in the short-term Tezos (XTZ) on the 4-hour chart shows weak bearish momentum. The price is trading below the middle Bollinger Band, indicating downward pressure. XTZ shows weak bearish momentum in the short-term The CMF is negative at -0.31, confirming continued selling, and the MFI is at 9.81, signaling oversold conditions. If the price holds above the lower Bollinger Band ($0.625), a short-term rebound may occur. However, if the downward trend continues, XTZ could break below the next key support. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9071 SELL SMA 5 $0.8381 SELL SMA 10 $0.8000 SELL SMA 21 $0.7435 SELL SMA 50 $0.7897 SELL SMA 100 $0.9996 SELL SMA 200 $0.9710 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7431 SELL EMA 5 $0.8019 SELL EMA 10 $0.9355 SELL EMA 21 $1.0969 SELL EMA 50 $1.1930 SELL EMA 100 $1.1234 SELL EMA 200 $1.0187 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos (XTZ) remains bearish, with the price below key indicators. The MFI is oversold, suggesting a possible bounce if $0.625 support holds. However, further downside is likely if this level breaks. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos up? Tezos (XTZ) is up today after bouncing off support at $0.6455, a move spurred by a slight capital inflow. The coin is now trading at around $0.656. XTZ 7-day price chart Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

For that to happen, future price movements and an increase in Tezos’ adoption must be bullish. Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit. After a failed attempt at breaking above $0.8 in early March, XTZ is currently trading around $0.6456 – $0.6631.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-30 23:25:00

The firm is the latest Russian business heavyweight to foray into the nation’s fast-growing DFAs market. The move appears to indicate that energy industry heavy-hitters are now ready to join commercial banks in the DFAs sector. Gazprom Enters ‘Digital Financial Assets’ Sector The Russian media outlet RBC reported that Gazprombank’s issuance is worth 2 billion rubles (over $23.5 million). The gas giant has explained that its DFAs provide an annual yield of 21%. It will issue the coins on March 31. The company will make the issuance via its banking arm, Gazprombank, using the Moscow Exchange’s DFA platform Gazprombank said its DFAs were essentially “tokenized monetary claims on the issuer.” The firm plans issue a total of 2 million tokens, with each token worth 1,000 rubles (around $11.77). The firm said the coins would mature on May 13, 2025, when each token will burn in exchange for a fiat sum of 1024.74 rubles ($12.06). Interestingly, regulatory documents note that the Gazprom DFA “meets the characteristics of digital financial assets that can be acquired by non-qualified investors.” This means that retail buyers can also trade the coins. This is often not the case with DFAs, many of which are only for the use of corporations and professional investors. Gazprom’s offices in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Boevaya mashina [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Telecoms Behemoth Also DFA-keen Gazprom’s move comes just days after a similar issuance from Rostelecom, another majority state-owned firm. Rostelecom is Russia’s largest provider of telecoms and other digital services. It issued two of its own DFAs on the Moscow Exchange earlier this month. The Central Bank issues DFA “information system operators (ISO)” with operating permits. One of the pioneers of the Russian DFA industry was Atomyze, a Hyperledger Fabric-based distributed ledger technology platform affiliated with the metals producer Norilsk Nickel. Russian police have charged billionaire Vadim Moshkovich, founder of the country's top agriculture company Rusagro, with fraud on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said, in the highest profile case against a major businessman in years. https://t.co/BjwmHsPlIh pic.twitter.com/bVzuH9Q2lv — Reuters (@Reuters) March 27, 2025 DFA Investment Is Rising Fast, Says Bank In February, Sberbank published a report claiming that the cumulative trading volume of Russia’s DFAs market has reached 684 billion rubles (around $8 billion). Earlier this month, the same bank issued an index-type DFA that tracks the price of cocoa on the global market . Last year, Gazprom announced the launch of a crypto mining subsidiary. This subsidiary is reportedly working on a 5,000-rig crypto mining center in the city of Veliky Novgorod, in the Novgorod Oblast . Sources think that the center will reach full capacity by 2028, with Gazprom reportedly ready to spend around a $500 million on its crypto mining interests.

Trump expressed his frustration in a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, saying he was “very angry” about Putin’s remarks hinting at replacing President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Ukraine. He said that if new leadership emerges in Ukraine, “you’re not going to have a deal for a long time, right.” Trump stated, “I was pissed off about it. But if a deal isn’t made, and if I think it was Russia’s fault, I’m going to put secondary sanctions on Russia.” He clarified he meant sanctions on “all oil coming out of Russia.” He also plans to speak with Putin this week. Russia is among the major oil producers in the world. Any attempt to limit Russian oil sales could affect the entire market and raise global inflation. India and China, which have bought much of Russia’s supply since the full-scale invasion, would be especially pressured. Trump said that if no deal is reached to stop the bloodshed, and if he thinks Russia is to blame, he will levy secondary tariffs on oil. He explained, “There will be a 25% tariff on all – on all oil, a 25 to 50-point tariff on all oil,” and countries purchasing Russian oil could face limits on doing business in the United States. Last week, US officials said Ukraine and Russia had agreed to a Black Sea truce as part of Trump’s efforts to end the war. Both sides accepted a 30-day halt on strikes against energy sites. Ukraine agreed to honor the ceasefire immediately, while the Kremlin demanded sanctions relief on Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial bodies that handle trade in food and fertilizers. March data showed Russian crude exports hitting a five-month high. Meanwhile, American sanctions on Russia’s tanker fleet appear less effective. Some analysts think Trump’s new threats could push oil prices higher, given the volumes at stake. Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS Group AG, noted that “in the past it has taken real disruptions for prices to move higher on a sustained basis,” so talk alone might not spark a lasting surge. Trump recently adopted new economic tactics Trump introduced a plan to impose secondary tariffs on countries buying oil from Venezuela. This threat, contained in an executive order, warns that anyone importing Venezuelan oil faces a 25% tariff on trade with the US. Venezuela is already under heavy American sanctions, and Trump said he was responding to “tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals” he accused Venezuela of sending to the United States. Beyond Venezuela, Trump also said he might punish Iran with secondary tariffs and spoke of bombing Iran until it renounces nuclear weapons. “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing,” he told NBC. This warning was included in a letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, giving Iran two months to negotiate a new nuclear accord. Trump has previously mentioned he could “go in militarily” if that is what it takes to keep Iran from getting nuclear arms. Iran responded that it will not hold direct talks with Trump’s administration, though indirect contacts are possible, President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Sunday.

Pi has shed 65% of its value in March, but with 80% of its community pushing for a Binance listing, April could open the door to a price rebound—if it lands an exchange breakthrough. Meanwhile, XLM is clinging to its $0.28 support, with falling volume and waning momentum threatening further downside. However, BlockDAG isn’t reacting to market moves—it’s driving them. Keynote 3 revealed over 800,000 active users mining BDAG through the X1 App, creating one of the most engaged pre-mainnet communities in crypto. This isn’t passive hype—it’s measurable participation. With $209.5M raised and presale price still at $0.0248, BlockDAG isn’t waiting for catalysts. It is the catalyst. Pi Network Price Outlook: Will Binance Be A Game Changer? After a steep 65% decline in March, Pi Network now trades at $0.83. Community energy remains high, with over 80% of users backing a Binance listing. Still, no major exchange has added Pi, leaving momentum stalled and sentiment shaky. Technically, a falling wedge pattern—typically bullish—has formed, and the BBTrend indicator is beginning to diverge upward. If momentum returns and Pi breaks resistance levels, a rally toward $1.50 could be in play—a 65% climb from current prices. But headwinds remain. With 117 million tokens scheduled to unlock this month, supply pressure could easily offset technical strength. Without a confirmed listing, Pi’s potential remains largely theoretical. XLM Struggles to Hold $0.28 as Bears Target $0.236 Stellar (XLM) is testing a key floor. Now near $0.286, the $0.28 level is proving to be a battleground. A break below that could lead to a 15% slide toward $0.236, with bearish signals forming after March’s rising wedge breakdown. Trading volume has dropped by 10% in the last 24 hours, and momentum indicators are softening. Coinglass data reveals $995K in longs at $0.28 and over $2.5 million in shorts stacked just above, highlighting increasing pressure on the bulls. There’s still hope for a reversal. A daily close above $0.31 would signal renewed strength. But for now, price action in the $0.285–$0.28 zone could decide whether XLM’s next move is up—or further down. 800K+ Users Already Mining BlockDAG—Here’s Why $1 Is Within Reach BlockDAG’s recent Keynote 3 made one thing abundantly clear: this isn’t a project waiting to grow—it’s already doing it. The headline? Over 800,000 users are actively mining BDAG through the X1 App, a free-to-use mobile mining platform. This isn’t future potential. It’s current momentum, and it’s happening before BDAG even hits centralized exchanges. The X1 App’s success lies in its frictionless model: zero-cost mining, gamified features, and a smooth, beginner-friendly interface. It’s helping users earn BDAG daily while naturally onboarding new participants through referrals and community engagement. This has created a grassroots engine of adoption—where usage isn’t driven by coin price hype, but by consistent utility and interaction. That kind of early traction is rare. It gives BlockDAG a foundation most Layer 1s struggle to build even after launch. And it’s not just mobile growth—the project has also sold over 19 billion coins, raised $209.5 million, and launched a live Beta Testnet that proves the network’s core architecture is already working. More than just technical progress, BlockDAG is strategically positioning itself for scale. With mainnet, exchange listings, smart contracts, and DeFi tools on the near-term roadmap, the infrastructure is falling into place quickly. Each layer adds to its value proposition: from real-world user participation, to cross-platform access, to utility baked directly into the ecosystem. Currently priced at just $0.0248 in Batch 27, BDAG still sits at a stage where early participation aligns directly with long-term upside. And unlike projects that rely on buzz, BlockDAG’s growth is quantifiable, tangible, and accelerating. This isn’t a slow roll toward relevance. It’s a coordinated rollout—with the users, capital, and infrastructure already in motion. As BlockDAG approaches its public listing phase, it’s not just another altcoin launch. It’s the emergence of a functioning ecosystem that could realistically reach $1, not just in theory—but through the layered momentum it’s already built. Takeaway Pi and XLM are both at crossroads. Pi’s falling wedge and community-driven push for a Binance listing offer hope, but supply pressure and listing delays keep outcomes uncertain. XLM is fighting to hold $0.28, with technical breakdown risks rising if bearish momentum intensifies. Both tokens are waiting for external validation. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is already executing. The X1 App’s 800,000+ users reflect a powerful on-chain community forming before launch. Keynote 3 laid out a clear blueprint: onboard users now, roll out utility next, and unleash listings with network demand already in place. At $0.0248, with $209.5M raised and real traction in motion, BDAG isn’t a concept—it’s a functioning ecosystem. When it hits public markets, it won’t be introducing itself. It’ll be amplifying momentum that’s already been built.

New data from the blockchain tracking firm Bubblemaps is shedding light on on-chain activity of Hayden Davis, who admitted to having a role in both Libra ( LIBRA ), a memecoin originally backed by Argentinian President Javier Milei before he quickly disavowed it, and Melania Meme ( MELANIA ), a coin inspired by Melania Trump. MELANIA began a steep descent the very day it was launched in January and is now down 95.3%. Says Bubblemaps, “Hayden Davis is STILL selling MELANIA He recently sent $1 million to exchanges and extracted over $2 million from the liquidity pools… For weeks, his MELANIA wallets were inactive – until now… In total, Hayden sent $1,065,153 worth of MELANIA to centralized exchanges and extracted $2,050,666 from the liquidity pool over the last 14 days. And many wallets haven’t sold yet. Why act now? Hayden may have seen the recent drop in attention as a window to quietly move funds while fewer people were watching We’ll keep monitoring for further activity.” At time of writing, MELANIA is trading for $0.615. Argentinian authorities are reportedly attempting to have Davis arrested by Interpol for his role in LIBRA. Says prosecutor Gregorio Dalbón, “I’m here to request the immediate detention of Hayden Mark Davis, a citizen of the United States, who is accused of being one of the principal actors behind the launch of the cryptocurrency LIBRA… The possibility that Davis will abandon his country of residence or hide to avoid answering for his alleged acts appears to be aggravated by the economic resources he possesses, which he can use to move or remain in hiding, hindering our investigation.” President Milei quickly disavowed LIBRA, claiming that he was tricked into supporting its launch. Said Milei in Spanish, “I was not aware of the details of the project and after having become aware of it I decided not to continue spreading the word (that is why I deleted the tweet). To the filthy rats of the political caste who want to take advantage of this situation to do harm, I want to say that every day they confirm how vile politicians are, and they increase our conviction to kick them in the a**.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While Solana and Cardano are enhancing their platforms with new integrations and focusing on market strategies, BlockDAG (BDAG) offers a unique approach by rewarding direct participation. BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet not only encourages but requires engagement by offering $6,000 in BDAG rewards for developers, miners, and users. This proactive involvement goes beyond mere speculation, with active smart contract implementation and a presale already raising $209.5 million, proving the power of genuine engagement in shaping the ecosystem. Polymarket Integrates Solana, Targets $170 Milestone Polymarket, a top player in crypto predictions, has added Solana (SOL) for deposits, making transactions quicker and cheaper for its users. This key step uses Solana’s fast and low-cost blockchain to provide a strong alternative to Ethereum’s often overloaded network. As a result, Polymarket expects to draw a wider audience, boosting the liquidity of its platform. This move also shows Polymarket’s dedication to supporting multiple blockchains, keeping it competitive in the fast-changing Web3 environment. On another note, Solana’s market strength is apparent. After hitting a resistance at $144, SOL stabilized around $138. Important technical indicators, like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) becoming oversold, indicate reducing sell-off pressures and a possible rebound. If SOL holds above $138, it could test resistance at $141 to $142, potentially pushing towards the $144 to $146 range. Cardano (ADA) Set for Potential Price Surge Cardano’s ADA is currently consolidating, trading between $0.695 and $0.75. A decisive break above $0.756 could lead to a 12% increase towards $0.85. Conversely, a drop below $0.69 might push it towards $0.65. Technical indicators suggest ADA is facing resistance at the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily chart. Market enthusiasm is evident, with a significant amount of long positions and a 40% increase in trading volume, signaling increased participation and potentially forecasting upcoming price movements. Traders should keep an eye on these critical levels and technical indicators to gauge ADA’s future direction. Earn BDAG Before the Launch: BlockDAG Beta Testnet Calls for Active Participation BlockDAG’s Beta “Primordial” Testnet is more than just a sneak peek; it’s a rewarding environment for early users to earn actual BDAG rewards. With a total of $6,000 in rewards, the initiative compensates the top 10 most engaged wallets, the top 10 mining nodes, and the top 10 wallets with the largest balances, granting each group $2,000 in BDAG at a starting price of $0.05 per coin. Notably, these rewards will be in mainnet BDAG, providing real-world value for their efforts. Developers will find this testnet not only a platform to test but a chance to execute smart contracts, enhance scalability, and gain recognition. The testnet is equipped with comprehensive tools like an IDE, block explorer, and EVM compatibility, which streamline and enhance the development process. This rewarding approach is part of an ongoing success, with BlockDAG’s crypto presale accumulating $209.5 million thus far. Currently at batch 27, the coin’s price has risen to $0.0248, marking a 2,380% increase from its initial batch, with over 19 billion coins sold, demonstrating strong initial demand and growing confidence in the project’s future. As the Beta Testnet runs until May 31, it not only assesses performance in real conditions but also engages builders and participants actively, providing a tangible stake in the project’s success. Whether coding or mining, BlockDAG values and rewards early contributions, setting the stage for its full operational launch. Raising the Bar: BlockDAG’s Testnet Focuses on Real Engagement While speculative movements often lead to quick price hikes, lasting value is forged through utility and active participation. As Solana integrates new features and Cardano addresses market hurdles, BlockDAG gains momentum through tangible involvement and definitive results. With direct incentives for testnet activity and over 19 billion coins already in circulation, BlockDAG is not just talking about potential; it’s actively proving it. With the May 31 deadline nearing, developers, miners, and early backers are not merely observers but are actively crafting the future. In a market that values demonstrable results, BlockDAG equips its community with the necessary tools to make a tangible impact.

While BTC holds key support at $82,000, BlackRock investors disposition may signal optimism. Bitcoin ETFs End 10-day Buying Spree, But BlackRock Investors Hold Bitcoin ETFs drew media attention on Friday as net outflows reached $93 million, marking the end of a 10-day buying spree that added over $1.07 billion in BTC. FairSide data reveals that all of the outflows came from Fidelity’s FBTC, while BlackRock ’s IBIT and eight other U.S.-approved spot ETFs recorded neutral flows, signaling diverging institutional investor sentiment. Bitcoin ETF Flows as of March 30 |Source: FairSide Despite the selling pressure, BTC price showed resilience, bouncing from a 10-day low of $82,000 to reclaim the $84,000 level over the weekend. This suggests that while some institutional players have turned cautious, BTC continues to find buyers at the $82,000 mark, likely driven by macroeconomic hedging. Why Are Bitcoin ETFs Taking a Neutral Outlook Despite Bearish Market Sentiment? While Bitcoin’s brief dip below $82,000 coincided with renewed regulatory uncertainty—following U.S. Congress’ scrutiny of Paul Atkins, Trump’s crypto-friendly SEC pick—the decision by major ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT to hold rather than sell suggests a more calculated approach among institutional investors. Macro Economic Hedging: One possible explanation is that institutional investors are weighing broader macroeconomic risks. With concerns mounting over Trump’s proposed trade policies and their potential impact on traditional stock markets, Bitcoin remains an attractive hedge due to its independence from traditional financial structures. This could explain why ETF outflows have been concentrated in specific funds like FBTC rather than across the board. Large Un-realized Profits Prior to the $93 million sell-off observed on Friday, Bitcoin ETFs had acquired over $1.07 billion in the previous 10-days. This sheer volume of Bitcoin accumulated by ETFs in recent weeks means that short-term supply is limited. It also hints that majority on investors who began buying when BTC prices plunged below $77,000 over the past week are still in profit, hence the reluctance to sell. Bitcoin Price Holds $82,000 Support, March 30, 2025 | Source: CoinMarketCap This key dynamics may have contributed to Bitcoin price holding key support levels above $82,000. Notably, while BTC price rebounded, leading altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple ( XRP ) have lagged behind, further reinforcing the narrative that institutional capital remains primarily focused on BTC. What’s Next for Bitcoin ETFs and Institutional Demand? The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin ETFs resume their accumulation trend or if further outflows signal a shift in sentiment. Investors will closely watch developments in U.S. regulatory policy and broader market conditions to assess whether Bitcoin’s status as a safe-haven asset remains intact. If the macroeconomic environment continues to favor Bitcoin as a non-correlated asset, ETF inflows could resume, pushing BTC to new highs. However, prolonged uncertainty or negative regulatory developments could trigger deeper corrections. For now, BlackRock and other major institutional players appear to be maintaining their positions, indicating confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Faces Critical Resistance at $84,400 Amid Bearish Pennant Formation Bitcoin price forecast signals remains uncertain as BTC trades at $82,363, hovering near key support levels. The Bollinger Bands show tightening volatility, with resistance at $84,412 and $88,215. The Parabolic SAR at $80,237 suggests a continuation of the downtrend unless BTC breaks above the mid-range resistance. Bitcoin Price Forecast A bearish pennant formation signals potential downside risk. If BTC fails to reclaim $84,400, selling pressure could drive the price towards $80,600 or even the lower Bollinger Band at $80,237. The volume delta reveals declining buying momentum, supporting the bearish case. However, a bullish scenario emerges if BTC can hold above $82,000 and break past $84,400 with strong volume. This could lead to a rally toward $88,215, negating the bearish pennant. With key resistance intact, Bitcoin’s trajectory depends on its next move at this crucial level.

However, this time around, China’s stock rally has diverged from the emerging markets, with multiple developing-nation equities remaining stagnant. Analysts claim that since most Chinese stock gains stemmed from the ongoing tech frenzy and not exactly from an improving economy, the rally has had little impact on other markets. China’s tech-supported stock rally began in January after Deepseek launched. Manik Narain, head of emerging-market strategy research at UBS Group AG in London, argued that a tech boost primarily drove the Chinese stock rally; hence, it’s very unlikely to have a “large spillover impact” on emerging markets. He added, “This is not the classical Chinese playbook of 2009, 2016, and 2020 that ultimately morphed into deported EM recoveries.” Since August 2024, The MSCI China Index has climbed by over 30% while EM outside China fell by 7%, contrary to other years where both markets saw gains consequently. Between 2009 and 2010, China’s share surged by 63%, while EM shares rose by more than 100%. More recently, in 2016 -2017, China’s stocks grew by 50% while the EM broad gauge increased by 46%. Chinese stocks were first influenced by tech boost in mid-January when the AI model Deepseek launched. Prior to this, specifically in September 2024, the stocks surged slightly over an overall economic stimulus. Meanwhile, the KraneShares CSI China Internet Fund, an ETF tracking China, received over $1.5 billion in 2025. Nonetheless, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex-China ETF was set for one of its few monthly outflows since 2022. Vedda says China’s outperformance could last longer Vincenzo Vedda, chief investment officer at DWS International in Frankfurt, believes China’s outperformance of other emerging markets may last longer. Nonetheless, China’s stock market is overly worried about higher US tariffs. President Donald Trump has already imposed 25% levies on auto imports from the country and is considering announcing more “reciprocal tariffs on April 2. Analysts have hinted that any more levies could dull the stock market growth and even result in more losses for EM. Some funds, however, have begun cutting off their Chinese holdings. Rohit Chopra, a portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management in New York, even said that they slashed some Chinese holdings from most of their funds. He claimed their funds were slightly less exposed to or underweight in China. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Chun said this shift will be driven by treasury managers feeling compelled to at least experiment with Bitcoin ( BTC ). “If you tried it and it worked, you’re a genius. If you tried it and it didn’t work, you at least tried. But if you didn’t try and have no good reason, your job may be at risk.” Strategy (MSTR) is the largest corporate Bitcoin holder of all 89 public-traded firms that currently have Bitcoin on their balance sheets, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET. One more firm could be added to the list after GameStop's $1.3 billion convertible notes offering on March 26, which the firm intends to use to buy its first batch of Bitcoin. Tesla and Block are the only S&P 500-listed firms that hold Bitcoin — meaning at least another 123 S&P 500 firms would need to invest in Bitcoin by 2030 for Chun’s prediction to be correct. The top 10 largest corporate Bitcoin holders. Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET Tech investors and execs expect Bitcoin to keep rising Bitcoin could soar to the $500,000 to $1,000,000 range or even higher by 2030, according to the likes of ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Block CEO Jack Dorsey. Meanwhile, firms adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies have seen a positive impact on their share prices . Strategy, whose stock has surged over 2,000% since its first Bitcoin investment on Aug. 20, 2020 — massively outperforming Bitcoin (781.1%) and S&P 500 (64.8%) over that stretch. But there’s a big difference between firms that adopt Bitcoin for treasury diversification and risk management and those that restructure their entire business models to become the Bitcoin treasury leader within their industries, Chun said. “Companies who are implementing this strategy in hopes of replicating MSTR’s performance are positioning for disappointment,” said Chun, who referred to Strategy as a “one-of-one.” MSTR initially provided US asset managers exposure to Bitcoin at a time when they couldn’t hold Bitcoin directly. That changed when the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a handful of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications on Jan. 10, 2024. Related: Bitcoin-to-gold ratio breaks 12-year support as gold price hits a record $3K Despite the increased adoption, Bitcoin used as a treasury asset remains an “unproven strategy” for firms hoping it will hedge against US dollar and fiat inflation or diversify their treasury for risk management purposes, Chun said. That said, Bitcoin is still a more flexible treasury asset than gold, according to Chun, who pointed out the challenges in storing and moving gold bars. On the other hand, Bitcoin is a digital commodity that is GAAP-recognized as a tangible asset with a fungible and liquid profile, he added. Earlier this month, crypto asset manager Bitwise launched Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF on March 11, which seeks to t rack companies with at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries.

The company's strategy benefits from rising institutional acceptance of Bitcoin, creating a positive feedback loop that could further drive up Bitcoin's price and validate MicroStrategy's model. Despite its potential for outsized gains, MicroStrategy's heavy reliance on Bitcoin's appreciation and its leveraged position make it an incredibly risky investment. MicroStrategy's unique business model and financial execution make it a compelling play for those who believe in Bitcoin as the ultimate scarce asset. In my previous article , I explored how MicroStrategy (MSTR) transformed from a small enterprise software provider to the world's first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company . This article builds on that earlier analysis by providing a more in-depth view of its successful capital-raising efforts and the measurable progress of its financial KPIs. MicroStrategy has accumulated a hoard of Bitcoin unrivaled by any other corporation or entity, making it a truly singular bet on Bitcoin. By adopting Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset and acquiring Bitcoin at an unprecedented rate, MicroStrategy offers investors an asymmetric opportunity on Bitcoin's ascent, wrapped in a public company. MicroStrategy has essentially turned itself into a highly leveraged Bitcoin proxy for better or worse, which positions investors for outsized gains should the bullish Bitcoin thesis play out. MicroStrategy has seen its share price skyrocket since adopting its Bitcoin strategy. Data by YCharts A Leveraged Pure-Play on 'Digital gold' MicroStrategy currently holds over half a million bitcoins on its balance sheet, which gives it exposure to 2.4% of Bitcoin's total supply. This massive position worth over $40 billion dollars gives MicroStrategy a unique value proposition as a leveraged Bitcoin pure-play unlike any other equity. In fact, MicroStrategy has historically moved 2-4x in magnitude for every 1x move in Bitcoin. Over the past three years, MicroStrategy shares have historically moved about 2x for every 1x move in Bitcoin, and often exceeded a 2x beta during euphoria phases. Not even a Bitcoin ETF provides this degree of torque. MicroStrategy investors essentially get a Bitcoin ETF on steroids, amplified by corporate holdings and clever uses of debt. Of course, this leverage play cuts both ways. For MicroStrategy to succeed, it requires Bitcoin to keep appreciating at a meaningful pace. While it's hard to predict the future value of any asset as volatile and unpredictable as Bitcoin, there are several compelling reasons to believe that Bitcoin will continue to skyrocket is value in the coming years. If this scenario were to play out, MicroStrategy could legitimately become one of the most valuable companies in the world. Positive Feedback Loop Created by Institutional Tailwinds MicroStrategy's strategy is increasingly buoyed by the rising institutional acceptance of Bitcoin. At the time MicroStrategy adopted its strategy, its future was far from certain. However, Wall Street and corporate America are finally warming up to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class after years of skepticism. BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund, which manages over $15 billion, had disclosed ~$47.4 million position in Bitcoin as of early 2025. While this amount only represents a small percent of its AUM, it is significant as a real sign of mainstream adoption. Even well-known companies like GameStop ( GME ) are starting to adopt MicroStrategy's Bitcoin business model, which will only further drive up demand for and subsequently the price of Bitcoin. In other words, the success of MicroStrategy creates a positive feedback loop. As MicroStrategy continues to succeed with its strategy, more companies and organizations will be incentivized to follow MicroStrategy's lead, thus further pushing up Bitcoin's cost. This, in turn, will only further validate MicroStrategy's business model of acquiring bitcoin as a legitimate way to increase shareholder value. As more companies and funds hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, the price of Bitcoin will only continue to rise. GameStop recently became one of the highest profile companies to announce plans to accumulate bitcoin as part of its strategy. GameStop's strategy is largely influenced by MicroStrategy's own capital-raising success, which demonstrates the self-reinforcing nature of institutional and corporate adoption. CryptoSlate The Inherent Value of Bitcoin Bitcoin's value proposition primarily rests on its provable scarcity, artificial scarcity, and sound money principles. While many scoff at the notion of Bitcoin being coined 'digital gold', there are good reasons why Bitcoin can be considered as such. In fact, Bitcoin is superior to gold in its hard cap of 21 million bitcoins. While gold is indeed scarce to a certain degree, there is no certainty that gold will retain its scarcity moving forward, be it through discoveries of new gold reserves or even through technological breakthroughs that make gold cheaper to make artificially . Bitcoin removes all doubt in its ability to remain a perfectly scarce asset as a result of its artificial scarcity. Even the rise of AI could indirectly support Bitcoin, as AI's growth may accelerate the digital transformation of finance. It will also likely lead to job automation and economic shifts that lead more people to seek stable, sovereign assets like Bitcoin. MicroStrategy is already keenly aware of the AI trend, as it was part of the reason why it rebranded to ""Strategy."" The company reasoned that ""Strategy"" was a more fitting name that highlights ""the two most transformative technologies of the 21st century: Bitcoin and AI."" Financial Engineering And Execution Excellence One of MicroStrategy's most underappreciated strengths is the financial engineering and execution behind its Bitcoin strategy. The company's management, let by CEO Michael Saylor and CFO Andrew Kang, has skillfully navigated capital markets to continually increase their Bitcoin holdings per share, which is a key metric to the success of MicroStrategy's strategy. After all, if existing shareholders can see their own individual Bitcoin exposure grow despite the company issuing equity to raise funds, MicroStrategy's model clearly works. MicroStrategy has even come up with a novel performance metric for this strategy called ""BTC Yield,"" which basically tracks the percentage growth in its bitcoin holdings relative to its diluted share count. In 2024, the company illustrated how accretive this financing strategy was by achieving a stunning 74.3% BTC Yield . In other words, MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings per share grew by 74.3%. Using such a metric, shareholders have an easy way to measure the success of the company by taking out the noise of dilution. MicroStrategy is able to increase ""BTC Yield"" through some relatively complex financial engineering of ""buying Bitcoin with other people's money."" Essentially, MicroStrategy issues long-dated debt at cheap rates that can convert to equity if the stock skyrockets, thereby leveraging its own stock volatility to acquire more Bitcoin. It's an incredibly high-wire act, but the execution so far has been near flawless. MicroStrategy has since deepened this strategy by issuing billions more in new convertible senior notes, along with introducing a ""Strike"" preferred stock series. This is all aimed at funding additional Bitcoin purchases. The company's ""21/21"" plan calls for raising $42 billion in total, with $21 billion coming from debt and $21 billion coming from equity/preferred by 2027. Notably, MicroStrategy has already secured $20 billion towards this goal, and has refinanced older debt into lower-coupon convertible notes in order to maintain a BTC Yield above 15%. Despite Growing Success, MicroStrategy is Still Incredibly Risky Despite MicroStrategy's enormous upside potential, the company is arguably one of the riskiest plays for a company of its valuation. First and foremost, Bitcoin's notorious volatility can wreak havoc on the company's stock in the short-medium term. We are already witnessing this as MicroStrategy's stock has regularly seen 10% intraday movements. This volatility is especially dangerous during downtrends, where MicroStrategy tends to exaggerate Bitcoin's losses due to its leveraged exposure. For instance, a 50% drop in Bitcoin prices could easily wipe out 80% of MicroStrategy's value. Liquidity and leverage also add another layer of risk. Even if Bitcoin's long-term prospects remained strong, if the asset were to collapse for an extended period of time, MicroStrategy would almost certainly face balance sheet strain given debt repayments down the road. The company's strategy of using equity issuance to pay down debt or buy new Bitcoin also means dilution, as existing shareholders are effectively bankrolling new Bitcoin purchases at the risk of their own ownership percentage. While this dilution has been accretive so far, evident in the company's BTC Yield metric, there is no guarantee that this will always hold true. The same feedback loop that works for MicroStrategy could actually work in reverse in a bear market. Finally, the ultimate risk would be that Bitcoin itself declines over the long term. Such a decline could be from any number of reasons, from growing investor apathy, the growing popularity of alternative cryptocurrencies, Government regulation, the threat posed by quantum computing , etc. At the end of the day, Bitcoin could easily be disrupted by newer technologies that take away investor attention or even make Bitcoin outright obsolete. Valuation Scenarios To illustrate why MicroStrategy is one of the most compelling plays in the market, we can model a few potential outcomes. If Bitcoin were to ~$200k and MicroStrategy executes on the remainder of its 21/21 Plan, the company's total stash of 900k BTC. At $200k per BTC, which is entirely realistic given Bitcoin's price appreciation history, this hoard will be worth $180 billion, implying more than 2x upside from MicroStrategy's current valuation. Of course, a significant drop in Bitcoin's price would also be equally devastating to MicroStrategy given its levered strategy. If Bitcoin were to drop to the $50k range, MicroStrategy's current BTC holdings would only be worth around ~$23.5B. In such a scenario, it would not be surprising to see MicroStrategy even trade at a discount to its BTC holdings, implying a 70-80% drop in the stock. At the end of the day, the driver of MicroStrategy's bull case remains the legitimacy of Bitcoin as an appreciating asset. The largest near-term catalyst for Bitcoin would be the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . If the Trump administration were to be successful in creating such a reserve, this would legitimize Bitcoin in a way that no other previous event has. What's more, this will also likely lead to a situation in which other nations and organizations race to establish their own Bitcoin reserves in anticipation of Bitcoin price rises or simply in attempts to diversify. Conclusion MicroStrategy offers investors an investment thesis that is as compelling as it is unconventional. Given how unique MicroStrategy's business model is, it is understandable why a large percentage of the investor community is incredibly wary of MicroStrategy. However, for those who believe in Bitcoin as the ultimate scarce asset, MicroStrategy is a proxy for an asset that is poised to reshape the global financial system. While the future is never certain, if Bitcoin is truly the ""'digital gold'"" for the 21st century, MicroStrategy could be one of the most compelling plays on the market right now at its current valuation of $75 billion.",MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-31 00:53:13

Analysts Tout Mutuum Finance (MUTM) To Trump ADA This Year,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-2-possible-in-march-analysts-tout-mutuum-finance-mutm-to-trump-ada-this-year/,"Cardano (ADA) rose 8% during the period between March 23 and March 25, attempting to break above the $0.76 resistance level for the third time in two weeks. Optimism from founder Charles Hoskinson’s campaign to promote network scalability and decentralization of governance hasn’t helped the token price remain buoyed, either, with ADA still 35% off its March 3 peak of $1.18. Speculations abound around partnerships with Trump-linked crypto ventures, but analysts wonder if ADA’s DeFi ecosystem can provide enough momentum to recover $1, much less $2. Instead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the go-to choice for investors seeking high upside potential for their cryptocurrency, whose presale is now in Phase 4 and a launch price 140% higher than presale. Cardano’s Uphill Battle And Cardano’s more recent price action hangs partly on political events. Donald Trump’s March 3 social media endorsement of ADA caused a rally, but later policy movements excluded altcoins from the U.S. Digital Asset reserves. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming DC Blockchain Summit 2025, at which Trump Jr. and Hoskinson will take the same stage. When looking ahead to what investors can expect in the future, some claim to look forward to partnerships with Trump-backed companies such as World Liberty Financial, whereas other critics describe these ventures as “pay-to-play” and not actually rooted in DeFi. Cardano’s layer-2 solution Hydra has recorded 1 million transactions per second in tests, and its eUTXO model claims base-layer transaction failures of zero—compared to Solana’s 40% failure rate. But DeFi adoption has been slow, leading protocol Indigo offers 28% yields on stablecoins but the returns which are paid in native tokens do not help the appeal. ADA’s ascent to $2, analysts say, hinges on demonstrable bumps in user activity and institutional inflows, neither of which have yet come to fruition. Mutuum Finance Gains Momentum While ADA suffers over the uncertainty of their future projects, it has little else to concern itself with compared to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which has attracted 7,400 investors who have so far contributed $5.7 million to its presale. Phase 4 tokens are priced at $0.025, with a 20% increase to $0.03 coming in Phase 5. With the listing price set at $0.06, that’s already secured 140% profits for pre-release buyers, and with post-launch projections of $3 mean it’ll be a 14,900% jump from this stage. Demand is driven by the project’s lending model. Users lock assets such as ETH or stablecoins into the platform, in exchange for interest-bearing mtTokens, which grow in value over time and can be traded on a range of DeFi platforms. MUTM tokens are continuously in demand from a buy-and-distribute mechanism where platform revenue is redirected to buy back MUTM tokens. In addition, overcollateralized loans and something that resembles peer to peer lending allows a greatly reduced systemic risk, appealing to conservative investors. Security and Incentives Mutuum Finance’s smart contract audit with Certik is almost done, with results to be published soon through official channels. The giveaway of 100,000 dollars to presale players, coupled with all this transparency, further cultivates confidence. Ten investors will take home $10,000 each as Phase 3 winds down fueling the FOMO even more. But as Cardano wrestles with execution of its technical strengths into market prevalence, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings together functionality and investor attraction. Its computed tokenomics and low presale entry point are concrete advantages over the speculative political gusts afflicting ADA. With Phase 4 in, gaining tokens for $0.025 becomes a narrow window phase which could be deciding for anyone ready for an exponential growth. Time To Act Cardano’s $2 target depends on the whims of some other forces altogether: regulatory changes, partnership announcements and DeFi adoption. That differs from Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which sets measurable goals, locking in presale profits and reporting a target of $3 post launch that aligns with analyst consensus. It is worth noting that Certik verification is in the final stage of assessment, with Phase 4 live, meaning to delay risk missing out on the lowest price available.

The cryptocurrency market is alive with new opportunities, and investors are flocking to fresh projects that could skyrocket. As the market continues to evolve, several meme coins are catching the eye of investors worldwide. In this article, we will take a deep dive into Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Floki Inu, and Bone ShibaSwap, highlighting their latest developments and potential for explosive growth. This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Floki Inu, and Bone ShibaSwap. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Glimpse into a Rewarding Investment Opportunity Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is fast becoming one of the most talked-about meme coins of 2025. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a newcomer to the world of cryptocurrencies, Arctic Pablo presents a unique opportunity. The presale of this token is especially enticing, with early investors set to reap potentially massive rewards. The project’s approach, including staking, referral incentives, and community competitions, is setting a high standard for what investors should expect from meme coins. APC offers a 66% APY during the presale, allowing investors to stake tokens and earn substantial rewards. Plus, the referral program allows you to spread the word about this exciting coin and earn even more. The community-centric competitions offer additional ways to earn APC tokens and USD rewards, making Arctic Pablo one of the most attractive opportunities in the meme coin market. One of the most compelling features of Arctic Pablo is its token burn mechanism, designed to enhance scarcity and value. Unsold tokens are burned each week during the presale, ensuring a deflationary environment. When the presale is over, any unsold tokens will also be burned, increasing the long-term sustainability and value of APC tokens. These transactions are recorded on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and reliability. The current presale price for Arctic Pablo Coin is just $0.000083, with a launch price of $0.008. That means early investors could see an ROI of over 9552.41% as the coin progresses to the listing price. With over $2 million raised so far and the project entering its 16th phase in Crystal Cove, there’s never been a better time to invest in Arctic Pablo Coin. The Presale Opportunity: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Unmatched Potential As Arctic Pablo reaches the Crystal Cove phase, the excitement is palpable. The presale is structured to provide maximum opportunities for early investors to secure their tokens at a low price before it inevitably rises. The project’s presale journey has already passed through 14 locations, and now, Crystal Cove is its current stop. During this presale stage, APC tokens are priced at an incredibly low $0.000083, giving investors the chance to purchase tokens before they increase in value. The Arctic Pablo presale is designed uniquely, without traditional stages. Instead, each “location” in its journey represents a significant phase of growth for the coin, building anticipation as the price continues to rise with every location. The token burn mechanism that’s in place adds another layer of value, ensuring that the total supply will gradually decrease, further enhancing the value of each token. By getting in early, you have the chance to secure an ROI of more than 9552.41%, from $0.000083 to the expected launch price of $0.008. With over $2 million raised so far, the momentum is building rapidly. As the meme coin presale continues, Arctic Pablo Coin is only becoming more valuable with each new phase. Get in now and position yourself to experience significant returns. Floki Inu: Latest Developments and Market Trends Floki Inu continues to make headlines as one of the most popular meme coins in the market. With its strong community-driven initiatives and exciting developments, Floki has cemented its position as a major player in the meme coin space. The recent introduction of the FlokiFi platform, a decentralized finance platform, has provided more utility for Floki Inu, enhancing its value and appeal to both investors and the wider crypto community. As Floki Inu continues to innovate, it remains one of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. Bone ShibaSwap: New Updates and Market Movement Bone ShibaSwap has seen a significant increase in activity as it continues to gain attention within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Recent updates include new partnerships and a growing user base for the ShibaSwap platform, which allows users to stake tokens, earn rewards, and participate in governance decisions. Bone ShibaSwap’s utility has expanded, making it an attractive asset for investors looking for more than just speculative gains. The token’s growth and the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s expansion make Bone ShibaSwap one of the standout meme coins of 2025. Final Thoughts: The Excitement Around Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale The world of meme coins is growing, and Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as a leader in this space. With its unique presale structure, token burn mechanism, staking rewards, and ROI potential, APC is a promising investment for anyone looking to capitalize on the top new meme coins to buy for 2025 . While Floki Inu and Bone ShibaSwap continue to make waves in the market, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale offers an exceptional opportunity to secure your position at an incredibly low price before it skyrockets.

With meme coin mania heating up again, one thing’s clear—early buyers are already stacking serious gains while others sit back watching. From Solana-based meme surges to Ethereum giants getting fresh utility layers, it’s a feeding frenzy out there. But here’s the kicker: the smartest plays aren’t even on the market yet—they’re in presales. That’s where BTFD Coin (BTFD) is flipping the game. Sitting in Stage 15 of 16, with a full P2E game already live, 2900% potential ROI, and a limited-time LAUNCH100 bonus deal, BTFD is quickly becoming the most talked-about meme coin presale. Combine that with strong movers like Notcoin (NOT) and Neiro (NEIRO), and you’ve got yourself a hitlist of the top new meme coins for exponential returns. Let’s break down why BTFD is at the top of the food chain—plus two other coins worth your radar. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Bull Market’s Secret Weapon Is in Presale Mode What if you could get 2x the tokens today, and a 2900% ROI tomorrow? That’s exactly what’s on the table right now with BTFD Coin , which is nearing the end of its presale run. At $0.0002 in Stage 15, just one final stage remains before launch. And when it lists at $0.0006, those who jumped in early could already 3x their investment. But it gets crazier… If BTFD hits its projected moon price of $0.006, that’s a mind-blowing 2900% ROI—turning small plays into monster gains. And yes, that kind of upside isn’t just hype—it’s fueled by the fundamentals: Live P2E Game : BTFD’s arcade-style game launched on January 1, 2025, and it’s not just fun—it’s paying users in crypto. Connect your wallet, play, earn tokens, and cash out or stake them. Staking Is Live : Since December 2, 2024, holders have been earning up to 90% APY just for locking their coins. Strong Community Backing : Over 11,600 Bulls have joined in, with more than 72 billion BTFD coins sold, pushing the presale tally past $6.43 million. Ethereum Backbone : BTFD runs on the Ethereum network with strong security and fast, cheap Layer 2 compatibility. BONUS ALERT: LAUNCH100 Ends March 30, 2025! Use the code LAUNCH100 and get 100% EXTRA coins—double your bag instantly! Here’s how: Head over to the BTFD Presale Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) Enter the code LAUNCH100 in the bonus field and apply. Choose your investment amount and confirm your purchase. Watch your tokens double instantly! Investment Scenario: Let’s say you invest $1500 in Stage 15 at $0.0002. That gets you 7.5 million BTFD coins. Use LAUNCH100, and you’re holding 15 million tokens. If BTFD reaches just its listing price of $0.0006, you’re sitting on $9,000. But if it rockets to $0.006? That’s a massive $90,000—from a $1500 play. Why is BTFD the first pick on this list of the top new meme coins for exponential returns? Because it’s one of the few meme coins with real utility, an active ecosystem, and a community that’s bullish before launch. The meme coin presale phase is almost over, and this might be your last golden ticket to get in before listings hit. 2. Notcoin (NOT): The Telegram Titan Turned Powerhouse Built straight out of the Telegram ecosystem, Notcoin (NOT) exploded onto the scene by gamifying user interaction. Unlike traditional meme coins, NOT made it cool to earn coins by just tapping a screen—blending addictive gaming mechanics with viral network effects. It recently gained traction through integrations with The Open Network (TON), making it more than just a tap-to-earn gimmick. With an upcoming mainnet transition and deeper DeFi compatibility in the pipeline, Notcoin’s appeal lies in how it continues to drive mass engagement while staying accessible. Why is Notcoin in this mix? Because it’s already captured millions of users and evolved into a scalable platform. NOT isn’t just a fad—it’s building something that holds up. 3. Neiro (NEIRO): The AI-Powered DeFi Disruptor Neiro proves that meme coins don’t have to be silly to succeed. This project merges artificial intelligence with decentralized finance, giving users smarter ways to manage their portfolios. It’s not all buzzwords either—Neiro’s AI tools are helping investors automate strategies, analyze market data, and enhance returns without lifting a finger. Currently making waves in the community for its ongoing beta testing and upcoming wallet release, NEIRO is appealing to a more strategic kind of meme coin investor—those looking to blend fun and function. Why does NEIRO deserve your attention among the top new meme coins for exponential returns? Because it’s built for the future of crypto—where AI meets DeFi in a way that feels effortless, smart, and profitable. Final Thoughts: The Bulls Are Already Charging—Will You? They say timing is everything in crypto. Right now, meme coins are getting hotter by the minute, and BTFD Coin is leading that charge with its high-utility model, live staking and gaming, and a presale that’s already breaking records. When analysts predict a 2900% ROI with real-world gaming and staking at 90% APY, smart investors listen. With Notcoin tapping into viral growth and Neiro adding AI intelligence to meme coin investing, you’ve got a mix of plays that covers hype, utility, and innovation. But only one of these is still under a penny, and only one is still in presale. Don’t let this one-stage window close on you. Visit the BTFD Presale Platform , claim your LAUNCH100 bonus, and join the Bulls Squad before it’s game over. This is your shot at catching one of the top new meme coins for exponential returns—before the rocket takes off.

42672358,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=702802,1743384708,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42672358.jpeg,Uniswap’s U.S. App Store ranking plummets amid declining trader activity,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/uniswaps-u-s-app-store-ranking-plummets/,"Uniswap’s ranking in the U.S. App Store’s finance category has dropped drastically, going from position 99 to 364 in the last two months. For most of 2024, Uniswap consistently ranked in the 190’s within the U.S. App Store’s finance category. The steep drop in Uniswap’s App Store ranking ignites discussions in the cryptocurrency world Following the election of pro-crypto President Donald Trump in the United States, Uniswap’s App Store ranking shot up to around 110th and later surged once more, reaching a record-breaking 99 when the president took office in January. However, Uniswap’s App Store ranking has drastically dropped since then, hitting even lower levels than in 2023. Though election hype helped to drive its rise, the platform’s fall has raised questions about more serious underlying issues. Of course, Uniswap wasn’t the only one to experience a post-election surge. A number of cryptocurrency apps also suddenly jumped in the rankings, but unlike Uniswap, most have since returned to their pre-election levels. SEC drops Uniswap probe, but large UNI transfers to Binance spark market concerns The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently dropped its probe into the firm. As per a Feb. 25 X post , the SEC concluded its investigation into Uniswap and has no plans to pursue enforcement action against the firm. The report followed Uniswap’s announcement that it received a Wells notice from the SEC in April 2024 while the commission was under the leadership of then-Chair Gary Gensler. “This is a huge win for DeFi and reaffirms what we’ve always known – that the technology we build is on the right side of the law, and our work is on the right side of history,” said Uniswap. Still, the number of traders using Uniswap on the Ethereum network has dropped by more than 45% since the start of 2025, falling from 69,680 to 37,000—the lowest since July 2023. Uniswap’s monthly trading volume also fell by 10% from December 2024 to January 2025, followed by another 22% drop the next month. Recent large transfers of UNI tokens to Binance have raised concerns about potential price pressure. On March 21, 2025, approximately 27.9 million UNI tokens were unlocked from Uniswap’s timelock contract, with significant portions subsequently moved to Binance. These transfers coincided with a 10% decline in UNI’s price, from $6.80 to $6.10. At the time of publication, Uniswap is trading at $5.79, a 2.5% decline in the last 24 hours. The bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with Ethereum hitting a 4-year low against BTC, likely contributed to UNI’s decline. Cryptocurrency apps secure top spots in the U.S. App Store finance rankings amid Trump’s memecoin trend The top three apps in the finance category of the U.S. App Store as of January 22 were all about cryptocurrencies. Among them were the online asset trading platforms Coinbase, Moonshot, and Crypto.com. Hence, cryptocurrency-related apps have taken over the top positions in the finance category of Apple’s App Store in the United States, defeating other apps. President Donald Trump’s meme coin trend quickly increased interest in crypto trading platforms, influencing cryptocurrency apps like Moonshot and Coinbase to secure top positions in the United States App Store finance rankings. In addition, the top 30 free apps in the finance category included other cryptocurrency apps, such as Coinbase Wallet, Robinhood, Binance.US, DEX Screener, and Kraken.

42672956,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=246707,1743386055,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis: 125% Surge in Options Trading Hints $2.50 Rebound This Week,https://coingape.com/markets/ripple-xrp-price-analysis-125-surge-in-options-trading-hints-2-50-rebound-this-week/,"XRP price is holding firm above $2 as traders position for a potential rebound, with derivatives data hinting at bullish momentum for the week ahead. Ripple (XRP) Holds Firm Above $2 as Markets Await Clarity Ripple (XRP) has endured volatile price action over the past week. XRP price closed the last three days of the week with 17% losses, plunging as low as $2.06 on Saturday, before bulls battled back to retake $2.10 at press time on March 31. Looking into the week ahead, market momentum hangs in the balance. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Crypto traders are awaiting clarity on the U.S. Congress confirmation process of Trump’s SEC chair nominee, Paul Atkins , a more crypto-friendly option to replace Gary Gensler. Amid concerns of conflicts of interest, investors will be closely watching. If Atkins’ confirmation faces rejection, many traders could begin selling, potentially driving Ripple price below $2 in the week ahead. 125% Surge in Options Trading Hints Positive Start to the Week While XRP held firm at the $2 support in the spot markets, traders appear to be placing optimistic bets in the derivatives markets. Coinglass ‘ latest data shows XRP options volume has surged by 125.93% to $7,540, while open interest grew 149.56% to $978,100. This significant increase suggests that investors are actively positioning for a strong move. Additionally, XRP’s long/short ratio of 0.9708 in the past 24 hours indicates a nearly balanced sentiment, slightly favouring long positions. Binance’s XRP/USDT long/short ratio for accounts stands at 3.1, signalling that traders on major exchanges expect a rebound. The top trader long/short ratio (accounts) on Binance is also at 2.8, further reinforcing this optimism. XRP Derivatives Markets Analysis, March 30 | Coinglass Another bullish signal is the 12-hour liquidation data, showing that $3.86M worth of long positions remained resilient compared to $1.78M short liquidations. This suggests that long traders are more confident in their positions, reducing the likelihood of a major sell-off. However, traders should remain cautious of the overall decline in trading volume, down 15.03% to $7.27B. This slowdown in market activity could limit XRP’s upside potential unless fresh catalysts emerge. At press time on Sunday, XRP price is showing resilience at $2, with derivatives traders placing bullish bets on a rebound. If positive momentum persists, XRP could target the $2.50 level in the coming week. However, regulatory uncertainty surrounding the SEC chair confirmation remains a key risk factor to watch. XRP Price Forecast: Bullish Breakout Could Send XRP to $2.50 Next Week XRP price forecast remains optimistic as the token holds steady above $2 despite the formation of a bearish pennant on the daily chart. The Parabolic SAR dots above the candles signal persistent bearish pressure, but the narrowing Keltner Channel (KC) suggests volatility is contracting, potentially setting up a sharp breakout. XRP price recently tested the lower KC boundary at $2.0273, reinforcing it as a key support level. XRP Price Forecast A bullish scenario emerges if XRP reclaims the middle KC line at $2.3043. A decisive close above this level could drive momentum toward the upper boundary at $2.58, paving the way for a $2.50 retest next week. Increasing options open interest from derivatives traders further strengthens the case for an upside move. However, a breakdown below $2.02 could invalidate this outlook. A daily close below this level may trigger further liquidations, exposing XRP price to the $1.90 zone. With volume declining and bearish formations still dominant, bulls must reclaim $2.30 quickly to confirm the reversal. Until then, XRP traders should watch for sustained momentum shifts before committing to a firm directional bias.

This trend isn’t isolated—the recent PI coin price drop reflects similar setbacks, linked to delays by major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. Amid these challenges, BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing attention with its dynamic approach. Its latest AMA introduced a $60K Testnet Incentive Campaign aimed at boosting engagement and testing the network’s capabilities prior to its Token Generation Event. This move has energized both new and existing holders, sparking significant demand for BDAG. TRON (TRX) Price Analysis: From Profit Peak to Steady Decline Recent TRON (TRX) price analysis reveals a substantial decrease—nearly 50% from its 2024 peak—yet it remains a top performer among layer-1 networks. Despite the downturn, TRON amassed over $700 million in 2025, surpassing competitors like Ethereum and Solana. Furthermore, TRON’s deflationary approach continues to burn more tokens than are created, effectively reducing its overall supply and potentially underpinning its value over time. The TRON price analysis also identifies a falling wedge pattern, which traditionally suggests potential for future gains. However, the real test for TRON will be demonstrating enduring value beyond transient trading patterns. PI Coin Price Drop Signals Market Skepticism & Reduced Activity The recent PI coin price drop has become a focal point after sinking below the $1 mark, recording an 18% decrease within a single day. Central to this downturn are the protracted delays in gaining listings on prominent exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, which have dampened the initial enthusiasm. Additionally, the deflationary forces are at play with over 528,000 tokens eliminated through transaction fees, and further supply contractions caused by unverified accounts. Although a diminishing supply can often bolster prices, it has yet to offset the prevailing negative outlook. The PI coin price drop is also paralleled by a 37% reduction in trade volume. BlockDAG’s Pre-TGE Momentum Grows with $60K Testnet Campaign BlockDAG recently unveiled a significant initiative as part of its preparation for the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE)—a Testnet Incentive Campaign. This campaign is crafted to assess network performance under realistic conditions by inviting user participation in a controlled environment. The campaign simulates operational conditions expected after the TGE, providing both developers and users the opportunity to engage with decentralized applications (dApps) and monitor network response under actual usage scenarios. The aim is to ensure a smooth and functional operation once the TGE is implemented. Featuring a targeted approach to engagement and rewards, the campaign will distribute $60,000 in total, with $2,000 going to each of 30 winners. These participants will be selected based on their activity levels, mining contributions, and wallet balances, aligning with the objective to stimulate robust network activity akin to a live environment. The announcement of this campaign has notably increased presale activities, with both new and existing participants eager to stake their claims. This enthusiasm has propelled BlockDAG’s metrics significantly, with over $208.5 million raised, 18.9 billion BDAG sold, and a 2,380% price increase noted since the initial offer. Presently priced at $0.0248 in the 27th batch, BlockDAG is rapidly gaining recognition as the best crypto to buy now due to its strategic execution and increasing demand as the TGE approaches. Market Trends and Strategic Moves While TRON continues to lead in profit generation, recent TRON price analysis highlights a struggle to regain its previous high following a substantial dip. Similarly, the PI coin price drop mirrors this downturn, exacerbated by missed listings on prominent exchanges, which have negatively impacted market sentiment. Amid these market fluctuations, BlockDAG’s community is seeing consistent growth. The recent AMA about the $60K Testnet Incentive Campaign has not only attracted a flood of new participants, pushing the presale past $208.5 million, but has also demonstrated the campaign’s effectiveness in fostering long-term engagement. With BDAG priced at just $0.0248 in the current batch and a TGE on the horizon, the potential for growth is substantial. The combination of strategic timing, transparent operations, and a well-mapped development plan positions BlockDAG as a compelling candidate for the best crypto to buy now .

With ETH hovering near $1,870, the liquidation trigger points—$1,805 and $1,787—are alarmingly close. These vaults have a health ratio barely above 1.00, meaning a sharp dip could flood the market with auto-sold ETH, intensifying downside pressure. While Maker grapples with risk management, Ethena Labs is making a different move. Its new sUSDe pool on Pendle adds real-world yield utility to ENA’s token, potentially offsetting the negative sentiment from its recent token unlock. The pool’s success could indicate stronger mid-term fundamentals. Yet, BlockDAG is already where others want to be. Keynote 3 confirmed its entire DeFi suite—staking, swaps, lending, and more—will go live at mainnet, not sometime post-launch. That’s rare. Backed by a $208M presale and $5M raised in just 48 hours, BlockDAG is showing it’s not just promising utility—it’s building it right now. $238M at Risk: Maker Vaults Face Liquidation as ETH Nears Danger Zone Two Ethereum whales are on the edge of losing $238 million worth of collateralized ETH as prices slump. According to Lookonchain, the whales have locked over 125,000 ETH in Maker vaults while borrowing $143.68 million in DAI. If ETH drops below $1,805 and $1,787, both vaults will be liquidated. With health ratios at 1.05 and 1.06—just above the critical 1.00 mark—the threat of forced liquidation is real. If triggered, the ETH will be auto-sold to cover debt, putting downward pressure on price. ETH is currently trading at $1,870, down 2.2% in 24 hours. Unless these whales inject more collateral, their positions could unravel fast. Ethena Launches New sUSDe Pool with Pendle—Will ENA Demand Rise? Ethena Labs has rolled out a new sUSDe yield pool in partnership with Pendle, running from March 25 to July 31, 2025. This move could draw in yield-hungry investors and deepen liquidity on Ethereum. The extended window gives market participants time to engage, and if the pool gains traction, it could signal stronger user confidence in Ethena’s ecosystem—potentially driving more demand for ENA tokens. With ENA already under the spotlight due to its massive token unlock, this added utility through yield farming may play a key role in shaping its mid-term price direction. Watch how much capital flows into the pool and the returns offered—those metrics could hint at where ENA is heading next. BlockDAG to Launch Full DeFi Suite—$5M Raised in 48 Hours Says It All BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 didn’t just showcase a testnet—it laid out a clear blueprint for becoming a DeFi powerhouse. One of the standout moments was the confirmation that full DeFi functionality will be available at mainnet launch. That includes staking, swaps, lending, bridges, and governance tools—built directly into the ecosystem from day one. Unlike most Layer 1s that roll these out slowly post-launch, BlockDAG is aiming to hit the ground running, giving users immediate financial utility. This aggressive rollout is backed by serious momentum. In just 48 hours, BlockDAG raised $5 million, bringing its total presale to over $208 million. With BDAG priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27, investors are clearly seeing the upside—especially with over 19 billion tokens sold and DeFi tools coming online soon. These fundamentals position BlockDAG to compete directly with Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche—not just on speed, but on real usability. The market is responding in kind, and if this pace continues, BDAG could emerge as one of the top DeFi-ready Layer 1s of the year. For those looking to enter early, the signals couldn’t be louder. This is the breakout moment. Takeaway The Ethereum liquidation alert reveals just how fragile large leveraged positions can become in uncertain markets. MakerDAO may weather the storm, but if ETH breaks key levels, it could trigger a cascade with broad implications. Ethena’s Pendle integration adds needed use-case depth, but whether that offsets the risk from its $3.29B unlock remains to be seen. Both ETH and ENA are playing defense—for now. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is executing like it’s already live. Its full DeFi suite isn’t a roadmap ambition—it’s a confirmed launch feature. While competitors gradually release functionality, BlockDAG is packaging it all into its mainnet debut. That alone gives BDAG a unique edge in both time-to-market and user readiness.

However, its sluggish growth, high transaction fees, and scalability challenges have left investors searching for more efficient alternatives. Despite ongoing upgrades like the Ethereum (ETH) 2.0, the network still faces congestion and fierce competition from newer blockchain projects that offer faster speeds and lower costs. As a result, savvy investors, often called “smart money,” are exploring undervalued crypto assets with stronger growth potential. One such emerging crypto, RCO Finance (RCOF), is gaining significant attention due to its solid fundamentals, unique value proposition, and growing investor interest. As Ethereum (ETH) growth slows in the market, the migration of capital into this undervalued asset signals a significant shift in the crypto landscape. The Current Market Performance Of Ethereum Despite its foundational role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, Ethereum has faced challenges impacting its market performance in the crypto space. As of late, Ethereum’s price has declined, with significant selling pressure pushing it below key support levels. According to available data on CoinGecko , ETH has lost over 23% in the past 30 days. This downturn has been attributed to various factors, including network congestion, high transaction fees, and competition from emerging blockchain platforms. RCO Finance: The Emerging Undervalued Crypto Asset In light of Ethereum’s stagnation, investors are turning their attention to RCO Finance, an innovative DeFi platform that uses new-generation technologies to revolutionize the decentralized finance market. The platform’s solid fundamentals and real-world utility set its token, RCOF, up for a potentially massive rally in the coming months. More investors and analysts are shifting their focus toward RCO Finance (RCOF), recognizing it as a promising asset capable of outperforming Ethereum (ETH) in terms of market growth. At the core of RCO Finance’s groundbreaking approach lies its AI-enhanced trading ecosystem, designed to help traders efficiently navigate the complexities of decentralized finance (DeFi). A standout feature of this system is the AI-driven Robo Advisor, a sophisticated tool that continuously processes real-time market data to develop strategic investment insights for optimal returns. Employing advanced algorithms, this AI-powered assistant detects lucrative trading opportunities before they gain mainstream attention, giving investors a vital advantage. For example, the $Jelly token recently experienced an 181% surge within a single day, an opportunity many traders failed to ride on. The Robo Advisor provides early alerts for such high-value movements, allowing investors to act before the broader market reacts. Additionally, RCO Finance’s AI technology is a key player in risk mitigation. Its real-time monitoring system issues alerts to help traders safeguard their assets from sudden market fluctuations. A recent example is the $SATS token , which saw a sharp 24% drop in just 24 hours. RCOF’s proactive risk management tools could have anticipated this event. RCO Finance integrates real-time financial data from trusted sources like Bloomberg and Reuters to further enhance its reliability. This direct access to verified market intelligence enables traders to make well-informed, data-driven decisions ahead of market shifts. Beyond trading, RCO Finance is a pioneer in asset tokenization, allowing fractional ownership of high-value assets, including real estate, commodities, and other premium investments. The platform boasts an extensive portfolio of over 120,000 assets spanning 12,500 categories, such as tokenized stocks, digital assets, commodities, etc. Another defining feature of RCO Finance is its dedication to privacy. RCOF prioritizes user privacy, allowing transactions to occur without invasive identity checks. This ensures a secure and unrestricted trading experience while maintaining financial privacy. With its state-of-the-art AI-powered trading tools, cutting-edge risk management system, and innovative asset tokenization framework, RCO Finance is revolutionizing the DeFi landscape. As momentum builds, industry professionals increasingly view the crypto token as a standout investment opportunity set to outperform Ethereum (ETH). RCOF Beta: A Sneak Peek Into the Future of DeFi RCO Finance (RCOF) has introduced its beta platform , offering early users an exclusive first look at its cutting-edge features before the official launch. With a growing community of over 10,000 active participants, this beta phase is crucial in optimizing the platform’s functionality and overall user experience. By actively engaging with feedback from early adopters, RCOF is fine-tuning its ecosystem to enhance efficiency, streamline operations, and deliver maximum value. The enthusiastic response from beta testers underscores the platform’s growing influence in the DeFi space. As RCO Finance gains momentum and continues to attract a rapidly expanding user base, its growing potential becomes even more evident. With a strong focus on innovation, user-driven development, and a commitment to advancing DeFi, RCOF is emerging as one of the most compelling investment opportunities in the crypto market. RCOF Presale: An Opportunity You Shouldn’t Miss As the Ethereum (ETH) price continues to struggle, crypto assets like RCOF present a good investment opportunity for smart money to capitalize. The RCOF presale is already in its fifth stage and has crossed the $12 million mark in total funds raised. As this phase nears its final stretch, the token price is set to increase from $0.10 to $0.13, presenting a prime opportunity for investors to join the presale and secure a lower entry point before the price increases in the next stage. Financial analysts anticipate significant growth potential, estimating that an early investment of just $1,000 could skyrocket to over $395,650 by Q2 2025. The RCO Finance team is gearing up for a $100,000 giveaway once they cross the $250,000 mark to celebrate the presale’s success and reward its early supporters. This initiative further demonstrates the project’s commitment to fostering a loyal and engaged investor community. In its ongoing efforts to prioritize security and transparency, RCOF has undergone a comprehensive smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof, a highly respected and renowned blockchain security company. This rigorous security check reinforces the platform’s reliability, ensuring that investors can confidently participate, knowing top-tier security protocols safeguard their assets.

Amid the buzz are innovative projects like Bitcoin Pepe that are gaining traction as early bidders make savvy moves. As top money flows into the crypto market again, the meme layer-2 solution for Bitcoin is galloping in presale with over $5.7 million raised so far. Confidence in the market has also seen a whale, undeterred by a more than $15 million loss on a previous trade, double down on Official Trump (TRUMP). However, could Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) be a better bullish bet? BPEP presale so far – $5.7 million and rising Bitcoin Pepe’s presale has gained significant momentum in the past week. Now in stage 8 of a 30-stage sale, the project’s token presale has so far hit $5.7 million. Interest in the innovative meme coin project has the native BPEP token trending, with its presale price at $0.0281. Ease of presale participation – one can buy BPEP using any of ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or SOL – is making it easy for more enthusiasts to take part. Andrea Burel @MAYCOL79 · Follow $bpep Watch on Twitter View replies 7:40 pm · 29 Mar 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter New momentum amid this rapid fundraising reflects a strong interest in Bitcoin Pepe’s vision to integrate meme coins with Bitcoin’s security. This underscores growing confidence in meme coins, particularly as Bitcoin Pepe positions itself as a project building Solana on Bitcoin. Whales making bold moves across the market only reinforces the bullish outlook. TRUMP – whale makes another bet The Official Trump (TRUMP) token entered the crypto space with a bang earlier this year, riding on US President Donald Trump’s inauguration. While the token plummeted afterward amid the scandalous launches of MELANIA and LIBRA tokens, a whale is making a fresh bet on TRUMP. According to details Onchain Lens shared on X, a crypto whale, previously hit with a $15.72 million loss on TRUMP, is doubling down on the trade. The investor recently spent $3.41 million to buy 333,664 TRUMP tokens, with the average purchase price of $10.22 per token. Is this a strategic bet on TRUMP that could pay off significantly? Or are projects like Bitcoin Pepe a better move? Why is Bitcoin Pepe potentially a great opportunity? Bitcoin Pepe stands out with its meme layer-2 for Bitcoin, mimicking Solana’s speed and low costs while leveraging Bitcoin’s security. Per the project’s whitepaper , the opportunity that BPEP offers “isn’t subtle.” The team points to meme coins hitting $100 billion in market cap without BTC. On the other hand, Bitcoin at its peak was a $2 trillion ecosystem without memes. Notably, Bitcoin Pepe wants to set the pace as the first project to merge these two market segments. The project introduces the PEP-20 token standard, enabling anyone to create meme coins natively on Bitcoin. Currently, BPEP is available for scooping at $0.0295 in stage 8.

Community members across Latin America and beyond are pouring into digital assets not just for diversification—but for the kind of upside legacy systems simply can’t offer. With blockchain innovations heating up, many are hunting for the best cryptos for exponential returns, and 2025 might just deliver on that wild potential. While some projects have already carved their place in the crypto hall of fame, others are on the verge of breakout status. Qubetics (TICS), Quant (QNT), and Astra are three names bouncing around serious circles lately. Each brings something unique to the table—but Qubetics is the one lighting up the charts with massive presale traction and analyst chatter about a possible 100x surge. Let’s unpack how these three digital assets stack up for those eyeing the best cryptos for exponential returns this year. Qubetics (TICS): Building a Marketplace for Tokenized Real-World Assets Qubetics isn’t here to play small. This next-gen blockchain project is aiming to crack a multitrillion-dollar nut: real-world asset tokenization. From real estate to invoices, art, equity, and even intellectual property—Qubetics is building a sleek, secure, and borderless marketplace where anything of value can be tokenized, traded, and fractionalized in real time. Here’s where it hits different: imagine a boutique hotel owner in Cartagena tokenizing room bookings for high season and offering them as tradable digital assets. Or a coffee farmer in Colombia minting tokens backed by future harvests and selling them directly to international buyers. A lawyer in Santiago could even tokenize their firm’s receivables, unlocking instant liquidity without groveling at the feet of a slow-moving bank. For professionals, businesses, and everyday backers, this unlocks access to previously illiquid markets, turbocharging access to capital and opportunity. And because it’s all baked into the Qubetics protocol, users can mint, validate, and transfer real-world assets using just a smartphone and some basic onboarding. In a space obsessed with hype, Qubetics is building hard-hitting utility—exactly why many crypto heads are calling it one of the best cryptos for exponential returns in 2025. This isn’t about buzzwords; it’s about problem-solving at scale. And the excitement? Justified. Qubetics Presale & Analyst ROI Forecasts The presale metrics are jaw-dropping. The crypto presale is in its 28th presale stage , with 504 million+ tokens sold to a thriving base of over 23,900 holders . The campaign has already raised more than $15.5 million , and each $TICS token is currently going for just $0.1430 . Analysts are all over this one. Their projections? $TICS at $1 means a 599% ROI . At $5, that shoots to 3396% ROI . $6 delivers 4095% ROI , while $10 smashes in 6892% ROI . And if Qubetics hits $15 after mainnet launch, that’s a staggering 10,388% ROI —turning early backers into serious players. For anyone scanning the horizon for the best cryptos for exponential returns , Qubetics is arguably the most hyped yet fundamentally sound shot at triple-digit gains. With token utility, real-world use cases, and red-hot presale numbers, it’s no surprise it’s being compared to the early days of Ethereum and Solana. Quant (QNT): Enterprise Blockchain Without the Buzzwords Quant is one of those projects that doesn’t need to scream to be taken seriously. Known across institutional and technical circles as the bridge between blockchains and legacy financial systems, Quant has built its reputation by quietly solving one of crypto’s biggest headaches: interoperability. Quant’s Overledger Network allows businesses, governments, and fintech platforms to seamlessly interact across multiple blockchains. So instead of choosing between Ethereum, Bitcoin, or Hyperledger, Quant lets systems work across them all—securely and simultaneously. That’s a big deal. For Latin American central banks flirting with CBDCs, or fintech startups in São Paulo looking to roll out multi-chain applications, Quant offers enterprise-grade reliability with the agility of modern Web3 infrastructure. It’s why Quant keeps finding itself in conversations with top-tier institutions around the world. No wonder community participants consider it a staple in any diversified blockchain strategy. Among mature crypto circles, Quant has earned the respect of backers who don’t fall for gimmicks. It’s known for compliance, reliability, and its focus on real-world enterprise use cases—everything from digital identity to cross-border settlement. It might not make daily headlines like meme coins do, but it doesn’t have to. Its position is solid, and its growth is steady. For those looking at the best cryptos for exponential returns , Quant may not promise 100x in a month, but it offers a unique angle: sustainable, infrastructure-first growth that large-scale partners are already using. And that kind of consistency is golden, especially in volatile markets. Astra: The Web3 Gateway for Data-Driven Applications Astra plays in a different league. It’s not trying to be a “do-it-all” chain—it’s positioning itself as the bedrock for data-driven decentralized applications (dApps), particularly in emerging markets. And it’s starting to show up in places where blockchain’s real impact can be felt—education, healthcare, and secure identity systems. The Astra protocol is designed for efficiency, low fees, and fast confirmation times, making it ideal for building out high-traffic applications without gas headaches. This makes it a favorite among developers in Latin America where infrastructure is often stretched thin and high fees can be a blocker. Think about a school system in Lima using Astra to verify student credentials on-chain. Or a mobile app in Mexico City offering digital health passports and insurance tracking using smart contracts. This kind of localized, real-world integration is what’s giving Astra its edge—and helping it rank among the best cryptos for exponential returns over the coming years. It’s also being used in community-driven projects like municipal budgeting tools, allowing transparency and real-time feedback between citizens and their local governments. That kind of impact doesn’t just build credibility—it builds demand. And when platforms demand native tokens for services and security, utility kicks into high gear. Astra may not have Quant’s institutional flair or Qubetics’ ROI buzz, but it’s carving out a clear niche. Among developers, civil tech advocates, and grassroots crypto communities, it’s become the platform of choice. That kind of adoption? It’s not loud, but it’s sticky. Conclusion There’s a reason crypto continues to eat into traditional finance’s dominance—it offers freedom, speed, and innovation at a level the old system can’t match. And in the hunt for the best cryptos for exponential returns , it’s becoming clear that strong fundamentals and real-world impact are separating the contenders from the pretenders. Qubetics brings game-changing use cases through tokenized real-world assets, a booming presale, and eye-watering ROI forecasts. Quant offers backbone-level infrastructure that institutions trust. And Astra is quietly empowering the next wave of decentralized applications in underserved markets. For those still on the fence, here’s the thing: the doors to Qubetics’ presale aren’t going to stay open forever. Once $TICS hits major exchanges, the entry price—and the ROI potential—will shift. Meanwhile, Quant and Astra continue building strong foundations in their own lanes. Now’s the time to act. Don’t just watch the future of finance unfold—be part of it. Explore the platforms making headlines for all the right reasons. These aren’t just coins—they’re catalysts.

Threat Fabric analysts said in a March 28 report that the Crocodilus malware uses a screen overlay warning users to back up their crypto wallet key by a specific deadline or risk losing access. “Once a victim provides a password from the application, the overlay will display a message: Back up your wallet key in the settings within 12 hours. Otherwise, the app will be reset, and you may lose access to your wallet,” Threat Fabric said. “This social engineering trick guides the victim to navigate to their seed phrase wallet key, allowing Crocodilus to harvest the text using its accessibility logger.” Source: Threat Fabric Once the threat actors have the seed phrase, they can seize complete control of the wallet and “drain it completely.” Threat Fabric says despite it being a new malware, Crocodilus has all the features of modern banking malware, with overlay attacks, advanced data harvesting through screen capture of sensitive information such as passwords and remote access to take control of the infected device. Initial infection occurs by inadvertently downloading the malware in other software that bypasses Android 13 and security protections, according to Threat Fabric. Once installed, Crocodilus requests accessibility service to be enabled, which enables the hackers to gain access to the device. “Once granted, the malware connects to the command-and-control (C2) server to receive instructions, including the list of target applications and the overlays to be used,” Threat Fabric said. Once installed, Crocodilus requests accessibility service to be enabled, granting hackers access to the device. Source: Threat Fabric It runs continuously, monitoring app launches and displaying overlays to intercept credentials. When a targeted banking or cryptocurrency app is opened, the fake overlay launches over the top and mutes the sound while the hackers take control of the device. “With stolen PII and credentials, threat actors can take full control of a victim’s device using built-in remote access, completing fraudulent transactions without detection,” Threat Fabric said. Threat Fabrix’s Mobile Threat Intelligence team has found the malware targets users in Turkey and Spain but said the scope of use will likely broaden over time. Related: Beware of ‘cracked’ TradingView — it’s a crypto-stealing trojan They also speculate the developers could speak Turkish, based on the notes in the code, and added that a threat actor known as Sybra or another hacker testing out new software could be behind the malware. “The emergence of the Crocodilus mobile banking Trojan marks a significant escalation in the sophistication and threat level posed by modern malware.” “With its advanced Device-Takeover capabilities, remote control features, and the deployment of black overlay attacks from its earliest iterations, Crocodilus demonstrates a level of maturity uncommon in newly discovered threats,” Threat Fabric added.

I'm upgrading the stock to a buy rating. Altcoin prices have shown resilience relative to Bitcoin's sharper drop, which may mean Coinbase's trading revenue won't fall as much as feared. Continued innovation, such as Coinbase One Premium at $300/month and Bitcoin-backed loans, is driving growth in non-transactional recurring revenue streams. Coinbase has also fallen to a very attractive ~9x forward adjusted EBITDA multiple, quite a modest valuation for such a high-growth company. Just a few months ago, the sentiment around Coinbase ( COIN ) and the crypto industry immediately after Trump’s re-election was all euphoria. Crypto investors cheered Trump’s embrace of crypto and promise to make the U.S. the “world capital of crypto,” alongside more friendly regulatory expectations and the establishment of a U.S. crypto reserve. All of these promises still hold. And yet, Bitcoin has tumbled ~20% from peaks, magnifying losses in the S&P 500 and defying the traditional logic that crypto should be a low-correlation asset that can be used as a market hedge, like gold. And against that backdrop, Coinbase has lost 30% of its value since the start of January. Data by YCharts In my view, this is a good juncture for investors to re-assess the bull case for Coinbase. I last wrote a neutral opinion on the stock in January , when Coinbase was still trading near $260. Today, with the stock more than 30% lower, I believe the recent sharp drop has more than compensated Coinbase for any added risk from the recent market turmoil. Though long on the sidelines for this stock due in large part to valuation concerns, I’m much more bullish on Coinbase at its lower prices. As such, I’m upgrading the stock to a buy rating. To me, all the structural and regulatory factors that drove the post-election surge, such as the establishment of a federal crypto reserve, still hold - and we don’t rehash those long-term drivers here. We’ll focus instead on what makes Coinbase a good buy on the dip, based on what has recently changed for the company: relative stability of altcoin prices (relative to BTC), continued innovation that will help to boost Coinbase’s more reliable subscription/services revenue stream, and a more benign valuation. Let’s now go through each of these factors in turn. Q4 trading revenue was on fire; Q1 won’t be bad as feared For investors who are newer to Coinbase, note that the company generates revenue across two distinct streams. Roughly 70% of Coinbase’s revenue derives from the spreads it earns on facilitating trading, while the remaining 30% is a more reliable stream of revenue from subscription fees, mining rewards, custodial fees, and interest. We’ll focus first on the trading portion, which, needless to say, enjoyed a huge burst of activity in the post-election period. In the most recently reported quarter, Q4, Coinbase reported $1.56 billion of transactional revenue, up roughly 3x y/y. Coinbase Q4 results (Coinbase Q4 shareholder letter) Needless to say, this is the lion’s share of the company’s revenue, and given the strict volatility and unpredictability of this activity, Coinbase explicitly does not provide any guidance for this revenue line - it only provides an outlook for subscription/services revenue as well as its expense ratios. Coinbase’s sharp ~30% fall since the start of the year is a reflection of investors’ fear that the pullback in crypto markets (and in risk-taking in general) will dent the company’s recent blazing growth trends. And while it’s true that growth rates will likely decelerate meaningfully from the 194% y/y that the company achieved in Q4, it’s likely to be better than feared. First - in the company’s Q4 shareholder letter, the company noted that it already earned “approximately $750 million” in trading revenue through February 11, or 42 trading days of the 88-day quarter. Of course, trading is volatile, and market losses picked up in late February - but if we do a simple extrapolation of February trends through the remainder of the quarter, we’d get anywhere from $1.5-$1.6 billion in revenue for the quarter, roughly ~40-50% growth versus $1.08 billion in the prior-year Q1. In other words, recent trends through mid-quarter are still pointing to shape double-digit y/y growth rates in trading revenue. Second: it’s important to note that while the large and best-known coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum make up the lion’s share of trading activity on the platform, they’re not the biggest chunk of revenue. Coinbase actually makes higher spreads on smaller altcoins. See the chart below: for the full year FY24, 57% of Coinbase’s revenue came from “other crypto assets” (not specifically defined as BTC, ETH, or XRP), versus just a 43% share of trading volume. Coinbase trading share by type and coin (Coinbase Q4 shareholder letter) Why this is important is because in the recent correction, it appears that the largest altcoins have had relatively better price stability than Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is down ~20% from peaks at $103k. Ethereum is down more than 50% from December peaks, just shy of $4k. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) which in the fourth quarter grew to a 14% share of Coinbase’s trading revenue (a bit over half of Bitcoin’s share, and generating more revenue than Ethereum), is actually flat to where it started the year, though down from February peaks in the high $2s. XRP price chart ( CoinMarketCap ) BNB (the 5th largest coin with a ~$90 billion market cap) is only down ~10% from December/January levels in the high $600s. BNB price chart ( CoinMarketCap ) The point here is that, by and large, it seems that crypto assets outside of Bitcoin have enjoyed greater price stability in this downturn - and since these are the coins that generate wider spreads for Coinbase, the company’s trading revenue growth might not drop as sharply as feared. Continued innovation is driving subscription fees Beyond the hope of continued growth in trading revenue, we also like the fact that Coinbase continues to develop its capabilities to continue growing its non-transactional recurring revenue base. One major initiative is Coinbase One, the company’s subscription membership. Over the past year, Coinbase has introduced the premium membership in more countries, which has helped the company’s international revenue contribution climb to 19% in Q4, up 3 points y/y. Though it doesn’t provide regular subscriber metrics each quarter, the company notes that it has passed the 600k subscriber mark, up “more than 50%” since Q1 of 2024. The final y also recently unveiled a new Coinbase One Premium tier, priced at a hefty $300/month and giving users access to unlimited zero trading fees and richer USDC wallet rewards. This is an offering that caters to true crypto professional traders. Rewards for holding USDC are also new, giving users more incentive to purchase and hold the USD-backed stablecoin (while Coinbase earns lucrative interest spreads on funds held). Coinbase also recently released loans backed by Bitcoin, which is an innovative application of blockchain technology. Bitcoin holders now also have the opportunity to “leverage” their bitcoins held in Coinbase and receive U.S. dollar-based loans, allowing them to access liquidity without selling their holdings and triggering capital gains. The company also continues to step up its offerings for institutional clients, which have increasingly waded into the crypto markets and following the new administration’s direction that crypto will be favorably looked upon and regulated. Institutional volumes more than doubled y/y in Q4. Per CFO Alesia Hess’s remarks on the Q4 earnings call: Our institutional trading volume was $345 billion, up 128%, also outperforming the U.S. spot market. Institutional transaction revenue was $141 million, up 156%. In the fourth quarter, we saw strong adoption of the Prime product suite. Across custody, trading, financing, and staking, our top clients are engaged with most of these products in 2024, and our onboarding pipeline remains robust. Our Prime financing product had all-time high loan balances in the fourth quarter in connection with the strong market conditions, and we see elevated trading amongst clients who are using financing.” In my view, all of these moves (especially the rollout of a professional-tier Coinbase One subscription) will help to diversify Coinbase’s revenue into steadier streams that reduce its dependence on volatile consumer trading. Valuation, risks, and key takeaways The biggest impetus to buy Coinbase now, however, is the fact that its valuation finally appears to have fallen to very reasonable levels. At current share prices near $174, Coinbase trades at a $44.16 billion market cap. After we net off the $9.82 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and USDC on Coinbase’s most recent balance sheet (and not counting ~$1.55 billion of other crypto assets held for investment) against $4.23 billion in debt, Coinbase’s resulting enterprise value is $38.57 billion. For FY25, Wall Street is currently expecting Coinbase to generate $8.12 billion in revenue, or 24% y/y growth. If we assume a 51% adjusted EBITDA margin on this revenue profile (a conservative assumption of flat margins to FY24), adjusted EBITDA would be $4.14 billion (+24% y/y). This puts Coinbase’s valuation multiples at: 4.8x EV/FY25 revenue 9.3x EV/FY25 adjusted EBITDA To me, a single-digit EBITDA multiple for a company that is on track to sustain double-digit growth in revenue this year, with plenty of secular tailwind for greater crypto adoption (particularly by institutions) is quite compelling. Of course, there are risks we need to keep in mind. The crypto community has long embraced a buy-and-hold (or “hodl”) mentality during downturns. Despite my earlier assertion that altcoins’ price has dipped more modestly compared to bitcoin, the nervous market environment overall could persuade more crypto owners to simply hold their positions rather than trade, reducing trading volumes and Coinbase’s revenue. This being said, however, I like the continued expansion of Coinbase’s non-trading revenue streams, and to me, risks are already more than embedded into the stock’s currently discounted price.

MARA Holdings, formerly Marathon Digital, said in a March 28 Form 8-K and prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it entered into an at-the-market agreement with investment giants, including Cantor Fitzgerald and Barclays, for them to sell up to $2 billion worth of its stock “from time to time.” “We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” MARA added. MARA’s move copies a tactic made famous by Bitcoin ( BTC ) bull Saylor, the executive chair of the largest corporate Bitcoin holder Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy, which has used a variety of market offerings, including stock sales, to amass 506,137 BTC worth $42.4 billion. MARA Holdings falls just behind Strategy with the second largest holdings by a public company, with 46,374 BTC worth around $3.9 billion in its coffers, according to Bitbo data. In July, the company’s CEO, Fred Thiel, said it was going “full HODL” and wouldn’t sell any of the Bitcoin it mined to fund its operations, as is typical for crypto miners, and would purchase more of the cryptocurrency to keep in reserve. Related: Crusoe to sell Bitcoin mining business to NYDIG to focus on AI The Bitcoin ( BTC ) miner’s planned stock sale follows a similar offering it made early last year that offered up to $1.5 billion worth of its shares. It also issued $1 billion of zero-coupon convertible senior notes in November with plans to use most of the proceeds to buy Bitcoin. Google Finance shows that MARA closed the March 28 trading day down 8.58% at $12.47, following on from crypto mining stocks being rattled a day earlier with reports that Microsoft abandoned plans to invest in new data centers in the US and Europe. MARA shares have fallen another 4.6% to $11.89 in overnight trading on March 30, according to Robinhood.

This follows a breakdown from consolidation, which has shifted the overall market sentiment toward ADA tokens. Cardano (ADA) Price Action and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA has finally turned bearish and is poised to continue its price decline in the coming days. This shift in sentiment follows the breakdown of a consolidation phase that ADA has been experiencing between the $0.69 and $0.75 levels for several weeks. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, there is a strong possibility that ADA could see a 5% price drop until it reaches the $0.625 level. Meanwhile, if the decline continues and a daily candle closes below the $0.622 level, there is a strong possibility that ADA’s price could plummet by 30% until it reaches the $0.425 level. As of now, ADA is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating a bearish trend and weak price action for the asset. Current Price Momentum Despite these fluctuations, ADA is currently trading near $0.66, having recorded a price decline of over 1% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, during the same period, the asset’s trading volume dropped by 30%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days. Key Liquidation Levels With this bearish price action and continuous decline, traders’ market sentiment remains unchanged as they continue to favor the bearish side.

The newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported that a branch of the Busan District Court’s Criminal Division sent the ringleader of the operation to jail for four and half years. The court found the trio guilty of fraud and violating the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes. South Korean Court: More Crypto Scammers Jailed The court heard that the ringleader was the CEO of an “investment” firm. This firm, said prosecutors, duped victims into thinking they would receive monthly payments worth 30% of their original stakes. The Busan District Court in Busan, South Korea. (Source: Busan District Court/Facebook) The presiding judge jailed two other officials (both unnamed for legal reasons). The judge jailed one for three and a half years, and the other for two years and six months. Prosecutors explained that the CEO and the other two officials “established an investment company in a building in Busan in June 2019.” The ring, the prosecution service explained, told would-be investors that they would “select and trade” holdings in around 1,000 “high-quality” altcoins on the investors’ behalf. @GooglePlay blocks 17 unregistered crypto apps in South Korea, targeting foreign exchanges like KuCoin and MEXC, as the FIU enforces strict compliance with local regulations. #CryptoRegulation #SouthKorea https://t.co/M9UoZ8w1dV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 26, 2025 The coins, the group said, were “hand-picked” projects based in countries “all over the world.” This method, they promised, would ensure that investors received monthly payments of 30% of their stakes. However, the investors were advised to keep their funds on the gang’s “platform,” rather than make withdrawals. Instead, the prosecution service continued, the group proceeded to embezzle a total of 610 million won.

The arrest comes amid reports of a rise in crypto-related fraud cases. Last year, prosecutors revealed details of cases involving fraudsters who targeted crypto scam victims by posing as regulators.

The March 30 hack was initially detected by blockchain security firms TenArmorAlert and Decurity , both of which posted warnings on X to alert users of the protocol. The protocol’s founder, known only as Xatarrer, described the hack as “the worst news a protocol could received [sic],” but suggested the team intends to try to keep the protocol going despite the setback. Source: SIR.trading on X “Clever attack” targeted contract vault Decurity described the hack as a “clever attack” that targeted a callback function used in the protocol’s “vulnerable contract Vault” which leverages Ethereum’s transient storage feature. According to Decurity, the attacker was able to replace the real Uniswap pool address used in this callback function with an address under the hacker’s control, allowing them to redirect the funds in the vault to their address. TenArmorAlert further explained that by repeatedly calling this callback function, the attacker was able to fully drain the protocol’s TVL. Source: Decurity SupLabsYi, from blockchain security firm Supremacy, went into more detail on the attack in an X post, stating it may demonstrate a security flaw in Ethereum’s transient storage. Transient storage was added to Ethereum with last year’s Dencun upgrade. The new feature allows for temporary storage of data leading to lower gas fees than regular storage. According to SupLabsYi, it’s still a “nascent feature,” and the attack may be one of the first to exploit its vulnerabilities. “This isn’t merely a threat aimed at a single instance of uniswapV3SwapCallback,” SupLabsYi said. TenArmorSecurity said the stolen funds have now been deposited into an address funded through the Ethereum privacy solution Railgun. Xatarrer has since reached out to Railgun for assistance. Related: DeFi hacks drop 40% in 2024, CeFi breaches surge to $694M — Hacken SIR.trading’s documentation shows that it was billed as “a new DeFi protocol for safer leverage.” The stated purpose of the protocol was to address some of the challenges of leveraged trading, “such as volatility decay and liquidation risks, making it safer for long-term investing.” While it aimed for safer leveraged trading, the protocol’s documentation did warn users that despite being audited, its smart contracts could still contain bugs that could lead to financial losses — highlighting the platform’s vaults as a particular area of vulnerability. “Undiscovered bugs or exploits in SIR’s smart contracts could lead to fund losses. These might stem from complex logic in vault mechanics or leverage calculations that audits failed to catch, exposing users to rare but critical failures,” the project’s documentation states.

The crypto market’s downturn is being driven by weak demand in spot markets and a clear shift toward derisking, with traders hesitant to take new positions.

It’s not just about luck—it’s about timing. While Pudgy Penguins rides the NFT wave and Snek slithers through Cardano with purpose, one name is changing the playbook for early gains and smart rewards— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token on the block. It’s a next-gen community-backed crypto revolution that’s making serious waves with its blazing-hot presale. Sitting in Stage 15 at just $0.0002, this is your chance to double up on tokens with the LAUNCH100 bonus code , ending March 30. With a jaw-dropping 2900% ROI potential at its projected moon price of $0.006 and a referral program that pays you to bring your crew, BTFD is hands down the most exciting pick among the top new meme coins to join today. BTFD Coin – Built Different, Backed by Bulls, and Bursting With Rewards Here’s a thought: What if you didn’t just invest in a coin but joined a movement—one built around community power, early adopter perks, and the best damn dip in crypto history? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin brings. With its 15th presale stage now live, over 72 billion tokens already sold, more than 11,600 holders, and $6.43 million raised, BTFD isn’t waiting for a bull run—it’s building one. Let’s break it down. Right now, you can still grab BTFD tokens at $0.0002. Use the promo code LAUNCH100 and you’ll get double the tokens. That’s a 100% bonus. Drop $2,000 right now? That nets you 10 million tokens, but with the bonus code, you’re walking away with 20 million BTFD coins. When it hits its listing price of $0.0006, that’s already $12,000. But here’s the kicker: analysts are eyeing a moon price of $0.006—meaning your $2,000 could turn into $120,000. No games. Just timing. And speaking of games, BTFD isn’t just about HODLing. The full version of its Play-to-Earn game launched on January 1, 2025. It’s live, it’s rewarding, and it’s fun. Run with the Bulls Squad, conquer levels, and earn crypto while you play. That’s the kind of utility most meme coins can only dream of. There’s also staking, which went live on December 2, 2024. Park your tokens and earn a wild 90% APY. It’s built for bulls who want to play long and smart. This meme coin presale isn’t gonna sit at the current price forever. With just one stage left before the launch price hits $0.0006, you’re looking at your last window to get in early. Make your move or miss the moonshot. Pudgy Penguins – The NFT Darling with Crypto Clout Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) made waves as one of the earliest NFT brands to break into mainstream retail. With physical toys in 10,000+ stores and an ETF filing that blends NFTs with crypto, PENGU’s become more than a meme—it’s a brand. Its massive community, slick branding, and NFT-fueled governance token give it staying power as one of the top new meme coins to join today. For crypto users looking for a mix of digital art and blockchain utility, Pudgy Penguins delivers. The project blends collectible hype with real-world reach, which is why it continues to stay relevant even when other NFTs fizzle out. But PENGU isn’t in presale, and those early gains? Gone. That’s where BTFD’s got the edge. Snek – Cardano’s Meme Coin with a Mission Over on the Cardano blockchain, Snek (SNEK) has carved a name for itself by leaning into grassroots hype and decentralized vibes. It’s a symbol of community strength, building trust through consistent delivery and meme-savvy culture. SNEK’s known for its low fees, green-chain alignment, and native liquidity. It’s caught fire within the Cardano ecosystem and built up a strong base of supporters. If you’re already rolling with ADA, SNEK probably popped up on your radar. It’s a meme coin with a pulse—but again, it’s already live. BTFD, meanwhile, is still in its high-reward entry phase, which puts it at the top of our top new meme coins to join today list. Time to Double Down – BTFD’s Referral Program and Bonus Code Explained So here’s the juicy part, the Bulls care about—the double token deal and monthly cash incentives. When you buy using code LAUNCH100, every BTFD coin you grab is instantly doubled. That means more to stake, more to play, more to hold. And if you’re out here pushing the BTFD movement? You get paid too. Connect your wallet at the BTFD site , grab your referral code, and start sharing it. Anyone who uses your code and buys $50+ gets 10% more tokens, and you—if you make it into the top 20—earn 10% of their raise amount in BTFD coins. This offer runs until March 30, 6 PM UTC, then resets on April 1. This isn’t your average crypto airdrop. This is a movement that rewards its community, fuels growth from within, and creates real value. So whether you’re a casual investor or someone with a whole Telegram squad, this program’s got serious potential. Final Words – You’re Either In or You’re Watching Others Win In a market where timing is everything, BTFD Coin gives you all the tools to win early. Between the 90% APY staking, live P2E game, 2900% ROI potential, and the killer referral program, it’s clearly not your average meme coin. Snek and Pudgy Penguins are cool. No doubt. But they’re established, and their high-reward entry window closed a while back. BTFD? It’s still wide open, and it’s closing fast. That’s why it leads our list of the top new meme coins to join today. If you want in before Stage 16 and that sweet 2x bonus vanishes, now’s the time. Don’t sleep on the next big moonshot. Join the BTFD Coin presale now. Lock in your 100% bonus before March 30. Stack. Stake. Game. Repeat.

ETH is now consolidating and remains at risk of more losses. Ethereum struggled to continue higher above the $2,000 resistance level. The price is trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,820 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $1,820 and $1,880 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $2,100 and started another decline, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $1,920 and $1,880 support levels. It tested the $1,765 zone. A low was formed at $1,767 and the price recently attempted a fresh upward move.

The first major resistance is near the $1,920 level. A clear move above the $1,920 resistance might send the price toward the $2,000 resistance. An upside break above the $2,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,050 resistance zone or even $2,120 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,880 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,780 level. The first major support sits near the $1,765 zone. A clear move below the $1,765 support might push the price toward the $1,720 support.
