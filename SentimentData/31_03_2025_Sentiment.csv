Helium operates an IoT network using hotspot technology, while Raydium offers a fast trading system through Solana’s DEX, both aiming to establish strong digital environments. However, both have encountered issues with consistent network functionality and market stability. In this context, BlockDAG (BDAG) distinguishes itself with a stable and resilient framework that incorporates fault tolerance as a fundamental feature. This focus on redundancy and constant operational capability allows developers and users to engage and create on the platform uninterrupted, significantly contributing to its success in presales. Helium: Advancing Decentralized IoT Connectivity Founded by Amir Haleem, Shawn Fanning, and Sean Carey in 2012, Helium launched its mainnet in 2019, aiming to revolutionize IoT connectivity through a decentralized network. The network expanded rapidly by incentivizing hotspot installations. In May 2023, Helium introduced a mobile plan at $20 monthly, greatly increasing user engagement. By December 2023, this service generated about 90% of the network’s revenue. Despite its growth, Helium’s native token, HNT, saw significant price changes. It grew by 124% in market cap to $1.3 billion and by 119% in price to $7.54 in Q3 2024. As of March 28, 2025, the price has fallen to $3.37, a steep drop from its peak of $48.80. Yet, Helium’s network expansion continues, driven by strategic alliances and global expansion efforts. Raydium: Leading the Charge in Solana’s Decentralized Trading Raydium was introduced in early 2021 as a DEX and AMM on the Solana blockchain, leveraging the blockchain’s capacity for high-speed, cost-effective transactions. This capability has drawn users looking for efficient trading options. By early 2024, weekly trade volumes on Raydium were between $1 and $2 billion, peaking at $12 billion later that year, indicating swift growth. As of March 28, 2025, Raydium’s token, RAY, is valued at $2.00, with a trading volume of about $56.99 million over 24 hours and a market cap of approximately $581.66 million. This represents 60.7% of all trading volume on Solana’s DEXes. Raydium’s success can be attributed to its deep liquidity, strategic partnerships, and ongoing development in the decentralized finance sector, establishing it as a prominent DEX within the Solana ecosystem. BlockDAG’s Dependable Framework for Continuous Uptime BlockDAG stands out among blockchain platforms with its dedicated focus on uptime and consistent network reliability. Its infrastructure is specifically designed to be fault-tolerant, equipped to handle both expected and unexpected disruptions effectively. The system’s strength comes from its geographically distributed nodes and built-in redundancy, ensuring the network stays active even if some nodes or regions fail. The network’s design incorporates multiple data centers globally, which facilitates continuous operations by shifting loads and processing to regions unaffected by any issues. This strategic infrastructure management helps avoid performance bottlenecks and reduces potential downtime, offering a reliable and stable environment for both users and developers. The effectiveness of this infrastructure has significantly contributed to the success of BlockDAG’s presale, raising $209.5 million and distributing over 19 billion coins so far. Currently priced at $0.0248 in its 27th batch, the ROI from the first batch has soared to 2,380%. This robust system not only showcases technical prowess but also builds trust in its capability for sustained performance. With a focus on maintaining network stability, BlockDAG remains a trusted platform for uninterrupted development and operation, essential as it scales and continues to attract more engagement. BlockDAG’s Solid Infrastructure: Key to Enduring Trust and Stability While network dependability is crucial for any blockchain initiative, it is particularly vital for those looking to secure long-term trust from users. Both Helium’s IoT network and Raydium’s decentralized trading platform have significantly impacted their respective fields, yet they have faced issues with infrastructure resilience and market stability. BlockDAG differentiates itself by prioritizing fault tolerance and redundancy, crucial features that ensure it remains robust against disruptions. This commitment not only builds user confidence but also drives consistent growth, evident from its strong crypto presale achievements. As blockchain technologies progress, the value of BlockDAG’s relentless focus on continuous uptime becomes increasingly pivotal, underscoring its potential for sustained success.

He sees it as political posturing and a way to woo crypto voters ahead of the 2026 midterms while doing the bare minimum to keep inflation under control. In an exclusive interview with Cryptopolitan, Arthur Hayes—CIO of Maelstrom, co-founder of BitMEX and one of the most outspoken figures in the crypto world—doesn’t mince words when it comes to the future of BTC and all the things that are weighing it down. With US-China tensions rising and tariffs making a comeback , could Bitcoin become a weapon in the new Cold War? Let’s dig in more with Hayes who thinks China might already be ahead in the BTC accumulation race. Bitcoin’s Wall Street takeover? With Bitcoin ETFs, institutional adoption, and political backing, many are celebrating what seems like the asset’s golden era. However, Hayes sees the flip side, warning that this mainstreaming could strip BTC of its rebel DNA and turn it into just another Wall Street asset. He believes that “Bitcoin is a bearer asset with a finite supply that cannot be altered by government or central bank diktat. It is the complete opposite of any TradFi asset which, even if it is in finite supply like equities, relies on the legal fiction woven by governments and enforced by men with guns.” We asked him if big banks would kill off stablecoin issuers like Tether or if regulators could shut down all stablecoins, bank-issued or not. He stood firm on Tether’s survival and highlighted that Tether is too big to kill because a disorderly unwind of their hundreds of billions of dollars worth of US Treasury securities would roil the market. “Tether is mostly used by non-Americans, US bank will issue a stablecoin in its first instance to service US persons. Therefore, Tether’s dominance will not be challenged,” said Hayes. Is Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve a smart move or a gimmick? Bitcoin and other top altcoins got an official call to be included in a government reserve. We asked Arthur whether this is the first step toward a Bitcoin-backed financial system or just political theater. He pointed out that “Trump and the Republican party have a tough mid-term election coming up in 2026. Trump needs to keep crypto investors on side so they show up with campaign donations and at the ballot box.” He added “But on the other hand, Trump can’t have inflation running wild, so wanton money printing, which would send Bitcoin quickly to new all-time highs, cannot be pursued because inflation harms all Americans. Trump will do the minimum necessary to gain the support of crypto investors.” President Trump Travels to Texas. Taken on January 12, 2021. Photo by Trump White House Archived via Flickr. Hayes believes China’s local governments have been mining Bitcoin for years and may already be ahead in accumulating reserves . He said that “the roughly 200,000 Bitcoin the US government seized or stole from individuals is what is going into the reserve. It is very possible that the Chinese government holds more Bitcoin than that.” Bitcoin as a trade war weapon? With rising US-China tensions and the return of aggressive tariffs, Bitcoin could become a strategic tool for countries to bypass financial sanctions and tariffs. We asked Arthur if we could see governments weaponizing BTC in global trade. He thinks Bitcoin is becoming a key tool for economic resistance. “Bitcoin will become the only way that balkanized economic blocs can be financially connected. In the near future, the major economic blocs will begin blocking the ability for capital to flow freely outside of their borders. At that point, Bitcoin, given that anyone with an internet connection can use it, will be the only way that citizens from different blocs can financially interact with each other,” he added. If global supply chains get disrupted again due to tariffs and economic nationalism, could that push businesses and individuals toward Bitcoin as a borderless asset? Maelstrom CIO suggested that “the balkanization of trade and finance is inflationary as every country must replicate production. The increase in productive capacity cannot be funded out of savings alone; therefore, fiat money printing will be used to finance this build out.” “Bitcoin benefits as the amount of global fiat credit expands. That is how Bitcoin benefits in a global trade war,” he further added. We’ve seen El Salvador going big on BTC, but they’re small. Which major nation do you think will be the first to shift a major part of their reserves into Bitcoin? Despite El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment, Hayes doubts any major economy will make Bitcoin its primary reserve asset. “It doesn’t make any sense for a government to ditch the privilege of issuing its own currency by fiat.” Arthur Hayes and Changpeng Zhao. Photo by Maelstrom via X. Are meme coins the real central bank killers? Forget BTC and ETH, meme coins are moving faster and creating more liquidity than some national currencies. Meanwhile, we have also seen more scams and hacks in the shadow of the meme coins explosion. Would it be possible to see a future where such coins disrupt fiat systems more than BTC? We asked Hayes, who frequently places his bets on social media. He indicated that “Meme coins will redirect investment flows from investments deemed suitable by the elites, to whatever is hot in the metaverse.” However, he thinks that this will frustrate the ability of baby boomers to dump their financial assets on the youth because the youth would rather buy a meme coin than a stock. During the recent election season, the market saw Trump and Biden-themed coins explode overnight. I asked for Arthur Hayes’s take on political parties officially launching their meme cryptos to raise funds and influence voters. He sees the real meme coin wars heating up during the 2026 midterm elections. “They are the perfect campaign financing tool for young aspiring politicians facing off against the gerontocracy,” he stated While meme coins may be more popular, Hayes says governments have one undeniable advantage in pushing CBDCs. “Governments that are serious about CBDCs will mandate that taxes be paid in them. Given that you must pay your taxes or get shot in the head, they will gain adoption alongside or in spite of meme coins,” Hayes added. Crypto’s next Black Swan? Hayes made waves in 2023 when he predicted the banking crisis. We asked him what the next major crypto shock could be, and he pointed towards a world war. “The Europeans are now hell bent on gearing up for war given Trump wants to find a peaceful solution to the Ukraine/Russia war. What if there is a nuclear exchange between Europe (NATO) and Russia?” he stated. Arthur Hayes has said that AI would prefer Bitcoin because of its energy-backed nature. But let’s go deeper, what’s the wildest scenario you see where AI and crypto collide? He envisions a near future where AI agents control financial transactions, on and off-chain. Hayes mentioned that “Humans will rely on AI agents to conduct all of their financial transactions, which will exist all on-chain in the near future.” He added “ I’m talking about both native crypto and TradFi assets.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

XRP has been pivotal in reshaping global payments, while TAO has been revolutionizing the integration of AI with decentralized networks. BlockDAG (BDAG) , however, is setting the stage for a more expansive framework. It’s rolling out a roadmap filled with decentralized identity features, AI capabilities, and enhanced self-governance, all built on its unique DAG architecture. With a massive $209.5 million from its presale and a staggering 2,380% ROI from its first to twenty-seventh batches, BlockDAG is proving to be more than just a tool—it’s becoming a crucial part of the Web3 foundation. XRP: Its Journey and Market Performance Created by Ripple Labs in 2012, XRP was crafted to make cross-border payments faster and cheaper. It began by tackling the inefficiencies in the banking sector with its real-time settlement capabilities. Initially, XRP’s price was minimal, only fractions of a cent. However, it has seen dramatic swings driven by market trends and regulatory actions. As of March 28, 2025, its trading price is around $2.32. XRP has faced significant regulatory scrutiny, especially from a 2020 SEC lawsuit, which has influenced both its price and market standing. Despite these challenges, XRP remains a powerhouse in the crypto world, with its market cap securing it a spot among the top digital currencies. Its continued adoption for financial transactions by major institutions highlights its enduring utility and potential in the finance sector’s future. Bittensor (TAO): Initial Launch, Market Fluctuations, and Performance TAO, Bittensor’s token, debuted on March 6, 2023, at $93.40, focusing on democratizing machine learning through a decentralized network. This model encourages a collective approach to AI, fostering an accessible market for artificial intelligence innovations. Since its introduction, TAO has faced typical market volatility, peaking at $757.60 in December 2023 before settling at around $479.85 by January 29, 2025. This represents a notable increase from its initial price, offering substantial value to early participants despite market ups and downs. Bittensor’s integration of blockchain with machine learning continues to draw interest from both tech enthusiasts and the broader crypto community. This focus on decentralized and collective intelligence makes it a prominent player at the intersection of AI and blockchain technologies. BlockDAG’s Blueprint for Advanced Web3 Capabilities As blockchain technology evolves, the focus is shifting from merely enhancing transaction efficiency to completely transforming the digital backbone of society. BlockDAG is at the forefront of this transformation. With a remarkable $209.5 million gathered through its presale, driven purely by community support, BlockDAG demonstrates the power of collective enthusiasm to transcend mere market excitement. Currently, at Batch 27, the project has sold over 19 billion coins at $0.0248 each, achieving an impressive 2,380% ROI since Batch 1. However, this is just the start for BlockDAG. The future roadmap, stretching beyond 2026, is ambitious: it includes integration with AI systems, development of decentralized identity solutions, and establishment of autonomous digital communities. These aren’t just plans—they are already incorporated into the architecture of BlockDAG. With a focus on user-centric features like account abstraction, zero-knowledge security, and adaptable smart contracts, BlockDAG is setting the stage for applications that extend well beyond traditional financial uses. Envision a world where personal identity is cryptographically yours and directly controlled, where decentralized AI agents use platforms like BlockDAG for transparent operations, and where governance systems are driven by the community according to codified rules. BlockDAG is crafting a vision of Web3 that reflects its potential to be built on principles of speed, durability, and trust. As the Beta Testnet launches and the Mainnet rollout nears, the future is not just on the horizon—it is actively being shaped. Pioneering the Next Generation of Blockchain Foundations The evolution of blockchain is leading to projects that transcend short-term speculation. XRP revolutionized speed within traditional financial systems, and Bittensor pioneered the integration of AI with decentralization. BlockDAG, however, is planning even further ahead, focusing on an AI-driven ecosystem, decentralized personal identities, and governance led by its community. Its architecture is designed to support not just cryptocurrency transactions but also the broader functionalities that the next phase of Web3 demands. The substantial $209.5 million raised in crypto presale globally without the backing of early venture capital reflects a shift in user expectations—they seek not just quicker transactions but also greater autonomy, practicality, and ownership. BlockDAG is laying the groundwork for the Web3 infrastructure necessary for these advanced capabilities.

Yes, Optimism is projected to close up on $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Expert Analyzes Four Years of SEC Drama,https://timestabloid.com/are-xrp-holders-burnt-out-expert-analyzes-four-years-of-sec-drama/,"All Things XRP (@XRP_investing), a well-known XRP community member on X, recently highlighted a growing sentiment among long-term XRP holders: emotional fatigue. After years of legal battles and expectations of a major price surge, many investors are experiencing exhaustion rather than excitement. The prolonged legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been a defining factor in XRP’s trajectory. Since the lawsuit began, the belief that a favorable outcome would lead to a dramatic price increase was widespread. However, the market’s reaction did not align with those expectations. The End of the Lawsuit and Market Disillusionment All Things XRP drew attention to the fact that the conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC did not produce the anticipated market surge. While XRP experienced a surge, it only climbed by around 11% and has since retraced those gains. All Things XRP noted that there was a limited impact from U.S. relistings. He added that there is a lack of new capital inflows and a market already priced in the legal outcome. The result was disillusionment among investors. Many long-term XRP holders had been waiting for years under the assumption that regulatory clarity would be the catalyst for significant price appreciation. Instead, the market remained stagnant, and enthusiasm has waned. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Potential vs. Market Sentiment Despite the fatigue among retail investors, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. All Things XRP pointed out that the asset plays a key role in global finance. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) is used by financial institutions. The company has secured partnerships for CBDC initiatives , and the asset remains one of the most established cryptocurrencies. However, the contradiction persists. XRP has a clear use case and real-world adoption, yet it remains psychologically draining to hold. The Path Forward for XRP Holders All Things XRP noted that investor sentiment follows cycles, with emotional fatigue often signaling market reversals. However, he believes burnout is a signal. Historically, exhaustion and apathy come just before renewed momentum. While no surge is guaranteed, past trends suggest fatigue may lead to renewed interest. Many long-term XRP holders feel indifferent, and some have stepped away, yet institutional accumulation often occurs quietly during such phases. XRP’s speculative hype has faded, but its utility remains. As All Things XRP stated , “XRP’s story isn’t over—just evolving,” and if you’re still holding on, you’re part of a unique community. One expert recently pointed out that the digital asset should already be trading above $100 , and this could soon become a reality as excitement builds in the community again.

Despite broader market optimism, ETH continues to face significant downside pressure due to regulatory uncertainty and weakening demand from institutional investors. Why is Ethereum Price Going Down? Ethereum’s decline is primarily driven by growing skepticism surrounding regulatory developments in the United States. The nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC chair, initially seen as a positive move for crypto, has faced mounting opposition in Congress due to potential conflicts of interest. This uncertainty has raised concerns that pro-crypto policies—including Trump’s proposed inclusion of ETH in the Crypto Strategic Reserve— could face delays or outright rejection. Ethereum Price Analysis | March 30 As a result, traders appear to be offloading ETH in favor of Bitcoin, which is perceived as a safer store of value amid regulatory unpredictability. Additionally, liquidity in Ethereum’s spot market has declined 26% in the last 24 hours, reflecting weak buying support at the current ETH price levels. This combination of regulatory headwinds and shifting market dynamics has kept ETH trapped below $1,800. 12.3 Million Addresses at Risk as ETH Struggles to Attract Buyers Ethereum’s on-chain data trends reveals a looming bearish signal ahead. According to IntoTheBlock , millions ETH addresses would slip into losses if prices fall below $1,600. The latest data suggests that the largest accumulation zone for ETH holders sits between $1,596 and $1,790, with 8.73 million addresses holding a combined 3.61 million ETH in this range. Ethereum In/Out of The Money Data, March 30 | Source: IntoTheBlock If ETH breaks below $1,600, it could trigger a cascade of sell-offs, further deepening the downturn. The lack of significant buying interest at current levels suggests that traders are waiting for either a clear regulatory breakthrough or a deeper price correction before re-entering the market. Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to sustain price levels above $1,780 as investors shift capital to Bitcoin (BTC), which recently reclaimed the $84,000 mark. Investors appear to be positioning themselves in BTC as a hedge against uncertainty. If the sell-0ffs continue on Monday, ETH price could be at risk major downsizing if such a large number of wallets capitulate within a short period. ETH Price Forecast: Ethereum Risks Breakdown Below $1,750 as Momentum Weakens Ethereum price remains on shaky ground, trading at $1,808.82, as technical indicators flash warning signs of further downside risk. The daily chart reveals a sustained bearish trend, with price action struggling below key resistance levels. The ADX breakout at $2,212 suggests significant resistance, and ETH’s failure to reclaim this level signals that bullish momentum is lacking. ETH Price Forecast The MACD indicator paints a concerning picture, with the MACD line at -98.38 firmly below the signal line at -105.99. This suggests that downward momentum is still in control, weakening the case for a reversal. The declining histogram bars reinforce this bearish trend, showing that selling pressure remains dominant. However, a potential recovery scenario exists if ETH can reclaim $1,850 and flip it into support. This would signal a possible retest of $2,212, but bullish conviction is currently lacking. A drop below $1,754—the lower bound of current price action—could trigger liquidation cascades, pushing ETH toward the critical $1,600 support, where 12.3 million addresses risk falling into losses.

Bitcoin is bouncing near $85K, Ethereum’s teasing a breakout, and a new wave of altcoins is waking up fast. One name that recently turned heads? Aptos. The so-called “Solana killer” popped hard, showing off what it can do. Early adopters walked away grinning. But here’s the thing—most backers now are wondering if Aptos already shot its shot. Meanwhile, another project is creeping into the spotlight. Qubetics ($TICS) is stirring serious buzz as one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025, and this one might just change the game. Qubetics isn’t here to play copycat. While projects like Aptos focus on speed and scalability, Qubetics is going straight for the jugular—solving some of the biggest real-life headaches that’ve plagued crypto since day one. Its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet is exactly what the space needs. From freelancers to global brands, folks are finally getting the tools to handle crypto without needing to be some kinda tech wizard. That’s why analysts and community members are tagging Qubetics as one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025. Aptos (APT): The New Kid with Speed, But Is It Enough? Aptos came in hot. Launched by ex-Meta engineers, it promised to fix the mess others left behind. Using its Move programming language and lightning-fast TPS (transactions per second), Aptos aimed to knock Solana off its pedestal. After a strong start, APT soared past $9 and even touched $11. Folks were calling it the next-gen Layer 1 chain. The project locked down some major partnerships, too. From blockchain gaming to DeFi projects, Aptos tried grabbing a slice of every market. Binance and other big names jumped in, adding fuel to the fire. With a market cap north of $3 billion, Aptos ain’t small potatoes anymore. But here’s the kicker—after that huge pump, APT’s been sliding. Right now, it’s hovering around $9, struggling to reclaim those highs. Analysts predict it could revisit $7 if the market softens, or rip back to $12 if momentum returns. Still, the hype’s cooled off, and folks are asking if Aptos is really worth chasing anymore. What’s missing? Real-life application for everyday people. Aptos might be fast, but how many freelancers, small businesses, or average Joes are out here trying to code on Move or build dApps? That’s why the search for top cryptos to buy for 2025 is shifting toward projects like Qubetics that offer actual utility for normal folks. Qubetics ($TICS): The Top Crypto to Buy for 2025 with a Revolutionary Wallet Qubetics isn’t just another shiny token. It’s the project turning heads because it’s fixing what’s broken. The Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet isn’t some gimmick—it’s the real deal. Imagine being able to send, receive, and manage your crypto bag across multiple blockchains without losing sleep over private keys, bridges, or sketchy exchanges. Picture this: a Miami-based real estate agent closes deals with international clients. Payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDT? No problem. Qubetics’ wallet lets him manage it all from one place. No third-party risks, no BS. Or think about a freelance photographer in LA getting gigs from Paris, Dubai, and Tokyo. Every time a client pays in a random token, it’s a nightmare juggling different wallets and exchanges. Qubetics makes that mess disappear. Payments land instantly, assets swap seamlessly, and she can cash out whenever she wants. Even big-time brands are watching. E-commerce platforms, SaaS companies, and global remittance services see Qubetics as a solution to the tangled web of crypto payments. Cross-chain transactions without backend chaos? That’s the dream—and Qubetics is building it. No wonder it’s ranking high on every list of top cryptos to buy for 2025. Now, let’s talk numbers. The crypto presale is already deep into its 27th stage. Over 504 million tokens sold. More than 23,900 holders in the bag. $15.5 million raised—and counting. Right now, $TICS is sitting pretty at $0.1300 per token. Analysts are drooling over the possible returns. If $TICS hits $1 after the presale? That’s a wild 669% ROI. Smash through $5? You’re staring down 3,745%. $6 means a fat 4,514%. But here’s where it gets juicy—projections have $TICS landing between $10 and $15 after the mainnet launch. That’s a potential 7,591% to 11,437% ROI. Life-changing kinda money. With Qubetics solving real-world problems and those insane ROI predictions, it’s easy to see why $TICS is being crowned one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025. The presale is still open, but for how long? That window’s closing fast. Final Thoughts Sure, Aptos had its moment. It showed up, flexed its tech, and made early buyers some solid gains. But that ship might’ve sailed. Aptos is still around, but it’s facing the same challenge as every hyped project—what’s next? Speed’s cool, but utility wins the long game. Qubetics is where the smart money’s heading. It’s the top crypto to buy for 2025 because it’s making crypto usable for everyone. Freelancers, businesses, even regular folks trying to dodge banks and clunky payment apps—Qubetics is their answer. Add those ridiculous ROI projections, and it’s a no-brainer. Don’t sit around watching $TICS hit $10 or $15 while wondering what could’ve been. Grab your stack now at $0.1300 and ride this wave. ‘Cause by the time Qubetics launches its mainnet, folks’ll be wishing they jumped in earlier. Qubetics isn’t just one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025—it might just be the best bet of the year.

While present figures are largely underwhelming for ADA, investors are brimming with confidence for a strong reversal in the near future. Cardano Price Can Reach $2.5 In May According to pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Master Kenobi, Cardano price is exhibiting cyclical behavior. In a post on X , Master Kenobi notes that ADA’s consolidation in recent days mirrors its price action from Q3 of 2024. At the time, Cardano’s price suffered a steep correction in early August and endured a lengthy consolidation period before rallying. Presently, Cardano’s price is consolidating after the deep in early February that sent prices to $0.49. “ADA is currently in a consolidation phase that resembles its behavior from August-September 2024,” said Master Kenobi. “Since the dip on August 5, it hasn’t recorded a new low – just as it hasn’t now, following the dip on February 3.” According to Master Kenobi, a lengthy consolidation phase will be the precursor for an impressive rally for Cardano’s price. The analyst theorizes that the incoming rally will send Cardano to impressive levels in May. In the short term, analysts are eyeing ADA to hit $1 , citing rising whale activity and positive fundamentals. “If this pattern holds, May could bring a massive pump, potentially pushing the price toward $2.5,” said Master Kenobi. ADA Ripples With Bullish Activity At the moment, Cardano price is trading at $0.6646, a far cry from its all-time high of $3.10. Despite the lull in price action, the ecosystem is brimming with bullish activity for higher valuation. Investors have their eyes on $10 after ADA outperformed top S&P 500 companies in a strong show of resilience. Futhermore, increased whale activity in the space is signaling an impending rally for ADA as community sentiment reaches an all-time high. Analysts have opined that an ADA rally to $10 is not a crazy prediction, citing a slew of positive fundamentals for the network. However, pundits are urging investors to brace for multiple corrections in the march to reach a valuation of $10.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $4.66 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $14.78. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.656 Market cap $680,394,046.41 Trading volume $12,427,451.95 Circulating supply 1,037,116,227.14 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $0.6456 24-hour high $0.6631 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.89% 50-day SMA $0.7897 14-Day RSI 40.21 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-day SMA $0.971 Tezos price analysis: Will XTZ break the $0.674 barrier? TL;DR Breakdown XTZ has gained 1.28% in the last 24 hours. The coin’s immediate support is at $0.64. XTZ’s resistance is around $0.674. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ might retest $0.64 support level Tezos (XTZ) shows a mixed outlook on March 30. The price is below the 20-period SMA, suggesting bearish pressure. XTZ might retest $0.64 support level However, the MACD is slightly positive, which may hint at a potential short-term reversal. The RSI at 43.50 is neutral, approaching oversold territory. Support at $0.64 is key—if this holds, a small bounce could occur, but further downside remains possible if the support is broken. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: XTZ shows weak bearish momentum in the short-term Tezos (XTZ) on the 4-hour chart shows weak bearish momentum. The price is trading below the middle Bollinger Band, indicating downward pressure. XTZ shows weak bearish momentum in the short-term The CMF is negative at -0.31, confirming continued selling, and the MFI is at 9.81, signaling oversold conditions. If the price holds above the lower Bollinger Band ($0.625), a short-term rebound may occur. However, if the downward trend continues, XTZ could break below the next key support. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9071 SELL SMA 5 $0.8381 SELL SMA 10 $0.8000 SELL SMA 21 $0.7435 SELL SMA 50 $0.7897 SELL SMA 100 $0.9996 SELL SMA 200 $0.9710 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7431 SELL EMA 5 $0.8019 SELL EMA 10 $0.9355 SELL EMA 21 $1.0969 SELL EMA 50 $1.1930 SELL EMA 100 $1.1234 SELL EMA 200 $1.0187 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos (XTZ) remains bearish, with the price below key indicators. The MFI is oversold, suggesting a possible bounce if $0.625 support holds. However, further downside is likely if this level breaks. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos up? Tezos (XTZ) is up today after bouncing off support at $0.6455, a move spurred by a slight capital inflow. The coin is now trading at around $0.656. XTZ 7-day price chart Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

For that to happen, future price movements and an increase in Tezos’ adoption must be bullish. Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit. After a failed attempt at breaking above $0.8 in early March, XTZ is currently trading around $0.6456 – $0.6631.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-30 23:25:00

The firm is the latest Russian business heavyweight to foray into the nation’s fast-growing DFAs market. The move appears to indicate that energy industry heavy-hitters are now ready to join commercial banks in the DFAs sector. Gazprom Enters ‘Digital Financial Assets’ Sector The Russian media outlet RBC reported that Gazprombank’s issuance is worth 2 billion rubles (over $23.5 million). The gas giant has explained that its DFAs provide an annual yield of 21%. It will issue the coins on March 31. The company will make the issuance via its banking arm, Gazprombank, using the Moscow Exchange’s DFA platform Gazprombank said its DFAs were essentially “tokenized monetary claims on the issuer.” The firm plans issue a total of 2 million tokens, with each token worth 1,000 rubles (around $11.77). The firm said the coins would mature on May 13, 2025, when each token will burn in exchange for a fiat sum of 1024.74 rubles ($12.06). Interestingly, regulatory documents note that the Gazprom DFA “meets the characteristics of digital financial assets that can be acquired by non-qualified investors.” This means that retail buyers can also trade the coins. This is often not the case with DFAs, many of which are only for the use of corporations and professional investors. Gazprom’s offices in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Boevaya mashina [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Telecoms Behemoth Also DFA-keen Gazprom’s move comes just days after a similar issuance from Rostelecom, another majority state-owned firm. Rostelecom is Russia’s largest provider of telecoms and other digital services. It issued two of its own DFAs on the Moscow Exchange earlier this month. The Central Bank issues DFA “information system operators (ISO)” with operating permits. One of the pioneers of the Russian DFA industry was Atomyze, a Hyperledger Fabric-based distributed ledger technology platform affiliated with the metals producer Norilsk Nickel. Russian police have charged billionaire Vadim Moshkovich, founder of the country's top agriculture company Rusagro, with fraud on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said, in the highest profile case against a major businessman in years. https://t.co/BjwmHsPlIh pic.twitter.com/bVzuH9Q2lv — Reuters (@Reuters) March 27, 2025 DFA Investment Is Rising Fast, Says Bank In February, Sberbank published a report claiming that the cumulative trading volume of Russia’s DFAs market has reached 684 billion rubles (around $8 billion). Earlier this month, the same bank issued an index-type DFA that tracks the price of cocoa on the global market . Last year, Gazprom announced the launch of a crypto mining subsidiary. This subsidiary is reportedly working on a 5,000-rig crypto mining center in the city of Veliky Novgorod, in the Novgorod Oblast . Sources think that the center will reach full capacity by 2028, with Gazprom reportedly ready to spend around a $500 million on its crypto mining interests.

Trump expressed his frustration in a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, saying he was “very angry” about Putin’s remarks hinting at replacing President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Ukraine. He said that if new leadership emerges in Ukraine, “you’re not going to have a deal for a long time, right.” Trump stated, “I was pissed off about it. But if a deal isn’t made, and if I think it was Russia’s fault, I’m going to put secondary sanctions on Russia.” He clarified he meant sanctions on “all oil coming out of Russia.” He also plans to speak with Putin this week. Russia is among the major oil producers in the world. Any attempt to limit Russian oil sales could affect the entire market and raise global inflation. India and China, which have bought much of Russia’s supply since the full-scale invasion, would be especially pressured. Trump said that if no deal is reached to stop the bloodshed, and if he thinks Russia is to blame, he will levy secondary tariffs on oil. He explained, “There will be a 25% tariff on all – on all oil, a 25 to 50-point tariff on all oil,” and countries purchasing Russian oil could face limits on doing business in the United States. Last week, US officials said Ukraine and Russia had agreed to a Black Sea truce as part of Trump’s efforts to end the war. Both sides accepted a 30-day halt on strikes against energy sites. Ukraine agreed to honor the ceasefire immediately, while the Kremlin demanded sanctions relief on Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial bodies that handle trade in food and fertilizers. March data showed Russian crude exports hitting a five-month high. Meanwhile, American sanctions on Russia’s tanker fleet appear less effective. Some analysts think Trump’s new threats could push oil prices higher, given the volumes at stake. Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS Group AG, noted that “in the past it has taken real disruptions for prices to move higher on a sustained basis,” so talk alone might not spark a lasting surge. Trump recently adopted new economic tactics Trump introduced a plan to impose secondary tariffs on countries buying oil from Venezuela. This threat, contained in an executive order, warns that anyone importing Venezuelan oil faces a 25% tariff on trade with the US. Venezuela is already under heavy American sanctions, and Trump said he was responding to “tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals” he accused Venezuela of sending to the United States. Beyond Venezuela, Trump also said he might punish Iran with secondary tariffs and spoke of bombing Iran until it renounces nuclear weapons. “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing,” he told NBC. This warning was included in a letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, giving Iran two months to negotiate a new nuclear accord. Trump has previously mentioned he could “go in militarily” if that is what it takes to keep Iran from getting nuclear arms. Iran responded that it will not hold direct talks with Trump’s administration, though indirect contacts are possible, President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Sunday.

Pi has shed 65% of its value in March, but with 80% of its community pushing for a Binance listing, April could open the door to a price rebound—if it lands an exchange breakthrough. Meanwhile, XLM is clinging to its $0.28 support, with falling volume and waning momentum threatening further downside. However, BlockDAG isn’t reacting to market moves—it’s driving them. Keynote 3 revealed over 800,000 active users mining BDAG through the X1 App, creating one of the most engaged pre-mainnet communities in crypto. This isn’t passive hype—it’s measurable participation. With $209.5M raised and presale price still at $0.0248, BlockDAG isn’t waiting for catalysts. It is the catalyst. Pi Network Price Outlook: Will Binance Be A Game Changer? After a steep 65% decline in March, Pi Network now trades at $0.83. Community energy remains high, with over 80% of users backing a Binance listing. Still, no major exchange has added Pi, leaving momentum stalled and sentiment shaky. Technically, a falling wedge pattern—typically bullish—has formed, and the BBTrend indicator is beginning to diverge upward. If momentum returns and Pi breaks resistance levels, a rally toward $1.50 could be in play—a 65% climb from current prices. But headwinds remain. With 117 million tokens scheduled to unlock this month, supply pressure could easily offset technical strength. Without a confirmed listing, Pi’s potential remains largely theoretical. XLM Struggles to Hold $0.28 as Bears Target $0.236 Stellar (XLM) is testing a key floor. Now near $0.286, the $0.28 level is proving to be a battleground. A break below that could lead to a 15% slide toward $0.236, with bearish signals forming after March’s rising wedge breakdown. Trading volume has dropped by 10% in the last 24 hours, and momentum indicators are softening. Coinglass data reveals $995K in longs at $0.28 and over $2.5 million in shorts stacked just above, highlighting increasing pressure on the bulls. There’s still hope for a reversal. A daily close above $0.31 would signal renewed strength. But for now, price action in the $0.285–$0.28 zone could decide whether XLM’s next move is up—or further down. 800K+ Users Already Mining BlockDAG—Here’s Why $1 Is Within Reach BlockDAG’s recent Keynote 3 made one thing abundantly clear: this isn’t a project waiting to grow—it’s already doing it. The headline? Over 800,000 users are actively mining BDAG through the X1 App, a free-to-use mobile mining platform. This isn’t future potential. It’s current momentum, and it’s happening before BDAG even hits centralized exchanges. The X1 App’s success lies in its frictionless model: zero-cost mining, gamified features, and a smooth, beginner-friendly interface. It’s helping users earn BDAG daily while naturally onboarding new participants through referrals and community engagement. This has created a grassroots engine of adoption—where usage isn’t driven by coin price hype, but by consistent utility and interaction. That kind of early traction is rare. It gives BlockDAG a foundation most Layer 1s struggle to build even after launch. And it’s not just mobile growth—the project has also sold over 19 billion coins, raised $209.5 million, and launched a live Beta Testnet that proves the network’s core architecture is already working. More than just technical progress, BlockDAG is strategically positioning itself for scale. With mainnet, exchange listings, smart contracts, and DeFi tools on the near-term roadmap, the infrastructure is falling into place quickly. Each layer adds to its value proposition: from real-world user participation, to cross-platform access, to utility baked directly into the ecosystem. Currently priced at just $0.0248 in Batch 27, BDAG still sits at a stage where early participation aligns directly with long-term upside. And unlike projects that rely on buzz, BlockDAG’s growth is quantifiable, tangible, and accelerating. This isn’t a slow roll toward relevance. It’s a coordinated rollout—with the users, capital, and infrastructure already in motion. As BlockDAG approaches its public listing phase, it’s not just another altcoin launch. It’s the emergence of a functioning ecosystem that could realistically reach $1, not just in theory—but through the layered momentum it’s already built. Takeaway Pi and XLM are both at crossroads. Pi’s falling wedge and community-driven push for a Binance listing offer hope, but supply pressure and listing delays keep outcomes uncertain. XLM is fighting to hold $0.28, with technical breakdown risks rising if bearish momentum intensifies. Both tokens are waiting for external validation. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is already executing. The X1 App’s 800,000+ users reflect a powerful on-chain community forming before launch. Keynote 3 laid out a clear blueprint: onboard users now, roll out utility next, and unleash listings with network demand already in place. At $0.0248, with $209.5M raised and real traction in motion, BDAG isn’t a concept—it’s a functioning ecosystem. When it hits public markets, it won’t be introducing itself. It’ll be amplifying momentum that’s already been built.

New data from the blockchain tracking firm Bubblemaps is shedding light on on-chain activity of Hayden Davis, who admitted to having a role in both Libra ( LIBRA ), a memecoin originally backed by Argentinian President Javier Milei before he quickly disavowed it, and Melania Meme ( MELANIA ), a coin inspired by Melania Trump. MELANIA began a steep descent the very day it was launched in January and is now down 95.3%. Says Bubblemaps, “Hayden Davis is STILL selling MELANIA He recently sent $1 million to exchanges and extracted over $2 million from the liquidity pools… For weeks, his MELANIA wallets were inactive – until now… In total, Hayden sent $1,065,153 worth of MELANIA to centralized exchanges and extracted $2,050,666 from the liquidity pool over the last 14 days. And many wallets haven’t sold yet. Why act now? Hayden may have seen the recent drop in attention as a window to quietly move funds while fewer people were watching We’ll keep monitoring for further activity.” At time of writing, MELANIA is trading for $0.615. Argentinian authorities are reportedly attempting to have Davis arrested by Interpol for his role in LIBRA. Says prosecutor Gregorio Dalbón, “I’m here to request the immediate detention of Hayden Mark Davis, a citizen of the United States, who is accused of being one of the principal actors behind the launch of the cryptocurrency LIBRA… The possibility that Davis will abandon his country of residence or hide to avoid answering for his alleged acts appears to be aggravated by the economic resources he possesses, which he can use to move or remain in hiding, hindering our investigation.” President Milei quickly disavowed LIBRA, claiming that he was tricked into supporting its launch. Said Milei in Spanish, “I was not aware of the details of the project and after having become aware of it I decided not to continue spreading the word (that is why I deleted the tweet). To the filthy rats of the political caste who want to take advantage of this situation to do harm, I want to say that every day they confirm how vile politicians are, and they increase our conviction to kick them in the a**.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While Solana and Cardano are enhancing their platforms with new integrations and focusing on market strategies, BlockDAG (BDAG) offers a unique approach by rewarding direct participation. BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet not only encourages but requires engagement by offering $6,000 in BDAG rewards for developers, miners, and users. This proactive involvement goes beyond mere speculation, with active smart contract implementation and a presale already raising $209.5 million, proving the power of genuine engagement in shaping the ecosystem. Polymarket Integrates Solana, Targets $170 Milestone Polymarket, a top player in crypto predictions, has added Solana (SOL) for deposits, making transactions quicker and cheaper for its users. This key step uses Solana’s fast and low-cost blockchain to provide a strong alternative to Ethereum’s often overloaded network. As a result, Polymarket expects to draw a wider audience, boosting the liquidity of its platform. This move also shows Polymarket’s dedication to supporting multiple blockchains, keeping it competitive in the fast-changing Web3 environment. On another note, Solana’s market strength is apparent. After hitting a resistance at $144, SOL stabilized around $138. Important technical indicators, like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) becoming oversold, indicate reducing sell-off pressures and a possible rebound. If SOL holds above $138, it could test resistance at $141 to $142, potentially pushing towards the $144 to $146 range. Cardano (ADA) Set for Potential Price Surge Cardano’s ADA is currently consolidating, trading between $0.695 and $0.75. A decisive break above $0.756 could lead to a 12% increase towards $0.85. Conversely, a drop below $0.69 might push it towards $0.65. Technical indicators suggest ADA is facing resistance at the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily chart. Market enthusiasm is evident, with a significant amount of long positions and a 40% increase in trading volume, signaling increased participation and potentially forecasting upcoming price movements. Traders should keep an eye on these critical levels and technical indicators to gauge ADA’s future direction. Earn BDAG Before the Launch: BlockDAG Beta Testnet Calls for Active Participation BlockDAG’s Beta “Primordial” Testnet is more than just a sneak peek; it’s a rewarding environment for early users to earn actual BDAG rewards. With a total of $6,000 in rewards, the initiative compensates the top 10 most engaged wallets, the top 10 mining nodes, and the top 10 wallets with the largest balances, granting each group $2,000 in BDAG at a starting price of $0.05 per coin. Notably, these rewards will be in mainnet BDAG, providing real-world value for their efforts. Developers will find this testnet not only a platform to test but a chance to execute smart contracts, enhance scalability, and gain recognition. The testnet is equipped with comprehensive tools like an IDE, block explorer, and EVM compatibility, which streamline and enhance the development process. This rewarding approach is part of an ongoing success, with BlockDAG’s crypto presale accumulating $209.5 million thus far. Currently at batch 27, the coin’s price has risen to $0.0248, marking a 2,380% increase from its initial batch, with over 19 billion coins sold, demonstrating strong initial demand and growing confidence in the project’s future. As the Beta Testnet runs until May 31, it not only assesses performance in real conditions but also engages builders and participants actively, providing a tangible stake in the project’s success. Whether coding or mining, BlockDAG values and rewards early contributions, setting the stage for its full operational launch. Raising the Bar: BlockDAG’s Testnet Focuses on Real Engagement While speculative movements often lead to quick price hikes, lasting value is forged through utility and active participation. As Solana integrates new features and Cardano addresses market hurdles, BlockDAG gains momentum through tangible involvement and definitive results. With direct incentives for testnet activity and over 19 billion coins already in circulation, BlockDAG is not just talking about potential; it’s actively proving it. With the May 31 deadline nearing, developers, miners, and early backers are not merely observers but are actively crafting the future. In a market that values demonstrable results, BlockDAG equips its community with the necessary tools to make a tangible impact.

While BTC holds key support at $82,000, BlackRock investors disposition may signal optimism. Bitcoin ETFs End 10-day Buying Spree, But BlackRock Investors Hold Bitcoin ETFs drew media attention on Friday as net outflows reached $93 million, marking the end of a 10-day buying spree that added over $1.07 billion in BTC. FairSide data reveals that all of the outflows came from Fidelity’s FBTC, while BlackRock ’s IBIT and eight other U.S.-approved spot ETFs recorded neutral flows, signaling diverging institutional investor sentiment. Bitcoin ETF Flows as of March 30 |Source: FairSide Despite the selling pressure, BTC price showed resilience, bouncing from a 10-day low of $82,000 to reclaim the $84,000 level over the weekend. This suggests that while some institutional players have turned cautious, BTC continues to find buyers at the $82,000 mark, likely driven by macroeconomic hedging. Why Are Bitcoin ETFs Taking a Neutral Outlook Despite Bearish Market Sentiment? While Bitcoin’s brief dip below $82,000 coincided with renewed regulatory uncertainty—following U.S. Congress’ scrutiny of Paul Atkins, Trump’s crypto-friendly SEC pick—the decision by major ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT to hold rather than sell suggests a more calculated approach among institutional investors. Macro Economic Hedging: One possible explanation is that institutional investors are weighing broader macroeconomic risks. With concerns mounting over Trump’s proposed trade policies and their potential impact on traditional stock markets, Bitcoin remains an attractive hedge due to its independence from traditional financial structures. This could explain why ETF outflows have been concentrated in specific funds like FBTC rather than across the board. Large Un-realized Profits Prior to the $93 million sell-off observed on Friday, Bitcoin ETFs had acquired over $1.07 billion in the previous 10-days. This sheer volume of Bitcoin accumulated by ETFs in recent weeks means that short-term supply is limited. It also hints that majority on investors who began buying when BTC prices plunged below $77,000 over the past week are still in profit, hence the reluctance to sell. Bitcoin Price Holds $82,000 Support, March 30, 2025 | Source: CoinMarketCap This key dynamics may have contributed to Bitcoin price holding key support levels above $82,000. Notably, while BTC price rebounded, leading altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple ( XRP ) have lagged behind, further reinforcing the narrative that institutional capital remains primarily focused on BTC. What’s Next for Bitcoin ETFs and Institutional Demand? The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin ETFs resume their accumulation trend or if further outflows signal a shift in sentiment. Investors will closely watch developments in U.S. regulatory policy and broader market conditions to assess whether Bitcoin’s status as a safe-haven asset remains intact. If the macroeconomic environment continues to favor Bitcoin as a non-correlated asset, ETF inflows could resume, pushing BTC to new highs. However, prolonged uncertainty or negative regulatory developments could trigger deeper corrections. For now, BlackRock and other major institutional players appear to be maintaining their positions, indicating confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Faces Critical Resistance at $84,400 Amid Bearish Pennant Formation Bitcoin price forecast signals remains uncertain as BTC trades at $82,363, hovering near key support levels. The Bollinger Bands show tightening volatility, with resistance at $84,412 and $88,215. The Parabolic SAR at $80,237 suggests a continuation of the downtrend unless BTC breaks above the mid-range resistance. Bitcoin Price Forecast A bearish pennant formation signals potential downside risk. If BTC fails to reclaim $84,400, selling pressure could drive the price towards $80,600 or even the lower Bollinger Band at $80,237. The volume delta reveals declining buying momentum, supporting the bearish case. However, a bullish scenario emerges if BTC can hold above $82,000 and break past $84,400 with strong volume. This could lead to a rally toward $88,215, negating the bearish pennant. With key resistance intact, Bitcoin’s trajectory depends on its next move at this crucial level.

However, this time around, China’s stock rally has diverged from the emerging markets, with multiple developing-nation equities remaining stagnant. Analysts claim that since most Chinese stock gains stemmed from the ongoing tech frenzy and not exactly from an improving economy, the rally has had little impact on other markets. China’s tech-supported stock rally began in January after Deepseek launched. Manik Narain, head of emerging-market strategy research at UBS Group AG in London, argued that a tech boost primarily drove the Chinese stock rally; hence, it’s very unlikely to have a “large spillover impact” on emerging markets. He added, “This is not the classical Chinese playbook of 2009, 2016, and 2020 that ultimately morphed into deported EM recoveries.” Since August 2024, The MSCI China Index has climbed by over 30% while EM outside China fell by 7%, contrary to other years where both markets saw gains consequently. Between 2009 and 2010, China’s share surged by 63%, while EM shares rose by more than 100%. More recently, in 2016 -2017, China’s stocks grew by 50% while the EM broad gauge increased by 46%. Chinese stocks were first influenced by tech boost in mid-January when the AI model Deepseek launched. Prior to this, specifically in September 2024, the stocks surged slightly over an overall economic stimulus. Meanwhile, the KraneShares CSI China Internet Fund, an ETF tracking China, received over $1.5 billion in 2025. Nonetheless, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex-China ETF was set for one of its few monthly outflows since 2022. Vedda says China’s outperformance could last longer Vincenzo Vedda, chief investment officer at DWS International in Frankfurt, believes China’s outperformance of other emerging markets may last longer. Nonetheless, China’s stock market is overly worried about higher US tariffs. President Donald Trump has already imposed 25% levies on auto imports from the country and is considering announcing more “reciprocal tariffs on April 2. Analysts have hinted that any more levies could dull the stock market growth and even result in more losses for EM. Some funds, however, have begun cutting off their Chinese holdings. Rohit Chopra, a portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management in New York, even said that they slashed some Chinese holdings from most of their funds. He claimed their funds were slightly less exposed to or underweight in China. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Chun said this shift will be driven by treasury managers feeling compelled to at least experiment with Bitcoin ( BTC ). “If you tried it and it worked, you’re a genius. If you tried it and it didn’t work, you at least tried. But if you didn’t try and have no good reason, your job may be at risk.” Strategy (MSTR) is the largest corporate Bitcoin holder of all 89 public-traded firms that currently have Bitcoin on their balance sheets, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET. One more firm could be added to the list after GameStop's $1.3 billion convertible notes offering on March 26, which the firm intends to use to buy its first batch of Bitcoin. Tesla and Block are the only S&P 500-listed firms that hold Bitcoin — meaning at least another 123 S&P 500 firms would need to invest in Bitcoin by 2030 for Chun’s prediction to be correct. The top 10 largest corporate Bitcoin holders. Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET Tech investors and execs expect Bitcoin to keep rising Bitcoin could soar to the $500,000 to $1,000,000 range or even higher by 2030, according to the likes of ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Block CEO Jack Dorsey. Meanwhile, firms adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies have seen a positive impact on their share prices . Strategy, whose stock has surged over 2,000% since its first Bitcoin investment on Aug. 20, 2020 — massively outperforming Bitcoin (781.1%) and S&P 500 (64.8%) over that stretch. But there’s a big difference between firms that adopt Bitcoin for treasury diversification and risk management and those that restructure their entire business models to become the Bitcoin treasury leader within their industries, Chun said. “Companies who are implementing this strategy in hopes of replicating MSTR’s performance are positioning for disappointment,” said Chun, who referred to Strategy as a “one-of-one.” MSTR initially provided US asset managers exposure to Bitcoin at a time when they couldn’t hold Bitcoin directly. That changed when the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a handful of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications on Jan. 10, 2024. Related: Bitcoin-to-gold ratio breaks 12-year support as gold price hits a record $3K Despite the increased adoption, Bitcoin used as a treasury asset remains an “unproven strategy” for firms hoping it will hedge against US dollar and fiat inflation or diversify their treasury for risk management purposes, Chun said. That said, Bitcoin is still a more flexible treasury asset than gold, according to Chun, who pointed out the challenges in storing and moving gold bars. On the other hand, Bitcoin is a digital commodity that is GAAP-recognized as a tangible asset with a fungible and liquid profile, he added. Earlier this month, crypto asset manager Bitwise launched Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF on March 11, which seeks to t rack companies with at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries.

The company's strategy benefits from rising institutional acceptance of Bitcoin, creating a positive feedback loop that could further drive up Bitcoin's price and validate MicroStrategy's model. Despite its potential for outsized gains, MicroStrategy's heavy reliance on Bitcoin's appreciation and its leveraged position make it an incredibly risky investment. MicroStrategy's unique business model and financial execution make it a compelling play for those who believe in Bitcoin as the ultimate scarce asset. In my previous article , I explored how MicroStrategy (MSTR) transformed from a small enterprise software provider to the world's first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company . This article builds on that earlier analysis by providing a more in-depth view of its successful capital-raising efforts and the measurable progress of its financial KPIs. MicroStrategy has accumulated a hoard of Bitcoin unrivaled by any other corporation or entity, making it a truly singular bet on Bitcoin. By adopting Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset and acquiring Bitcoin at an unprecedented rate, MicroStrategy offers investors an asymmetric opportunity on Bitcoin's ascent, wrapped in a public company. MicroStrategy has essentially turned itself into a highly leveraged Bitcoin proxy for better or worse, which positions investors for outsized gains should the bullish Bitcoin thesis play out. MicroStrategy has seen its share price skyrocket since adopting its Bitcoin strategy. Data by YCharts A Leveraged Pure-Play on 'Digital gold' MicroStrategy currently holds over half a million bitcoins on its balance sheet, which gives it exposure to 2.4% of Bitcoin's total supply. This massive position worth over $40 billion dollars gives MicroStrategy a unique value proposition as a leveraged Bitcoin pure-play unlike any other equity. In fact, MicroStrategy has historically moved 2-4x in magnitude for every 1x move in Bitcoin. Over the past three years, MicroStrategy shares have historically moved about 2x for every 1x move in Bitcoin, and often exceeded a 2x beta during euphoria phases. Not even a Bitcoin ETF provides this degree of torque. MicroStrategy investors essentially get a Bitcoin ETF on steroids, amplified by corporate holdings and clever uses of debt. Of course, this leverage play cuts both ways. For MicroStrategy to succeed, it requires Bitcoin to keep appreciating at a meaningful pace. While it's hard to predict the future value of any asset as volatile and unpredictable as Bitcoin, there are several compelling reasons to believe that Bitcoin will continue to skyrocket is value in the coming years. If this scenario were to play out, MicroStrategy could legitimately become one of the most valuable companies in the world. Positive Feedback Loop Created by Institutional Tailwinds MicroStrategy's strategy is increasingly buoyed by the rising institutional acceptance of Bitcoin. At the time MicroStrategy adopted its strategy, its future was far from certain. However, Wall Street and corporate America are finally warming up to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class after years of skepticism. BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund, which manages over $15 billion, had disclosed ~$47.4 million position in Bitcoin as of early 2025. While this amount only represents a small percent of its AUM, it is significant as a real sign of mainstream adoption. Even well-known companies like GameStop ( GME ) are starting to adopt MicroStrategy's Bitcoin business model, which will only further drive up demand for and subsequently the price of Bitcoin. In other words, the success of MicroStrategy creates a positive feedback loop. As MicroStrategy continues to succeed with its strategy, more companies and organizations will be incentivized to follow MicroStrategy's lead, thus further pushing up Bitcoin's cost. This, in turn, will only further validate MicroStrategy's business model of acquiring bitcoin as a legitimate way to increase shareholder value. As more companies and funds hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, the price of Bitcoin will only continue to rise. GameStop recently became one of the highest profile companies to announce plans to accumulate bitcoin as part of its strategy. GameStop's strategy is largely influenced by MicroStrategy's own capital-raising success, which demonstrates the self-reinforcing nature of institutional and corporate adoption. CryptoSlate The Inherent Value of Bitcoin Bitcoin's value proposition primarily rests on its provable scarcity, artificial scarcity, and sound money principles. While many scoff at the notion of Bitcoin being coined 'digital gold', there are good reasons why Bitcoin can be considered as such. In fact, Bitcoin is superior to gold in its hard cap of 21 million bitcoins. While gold is indeed scarce to a certain degree, there is no certainty that gold will retain its scarcity moving forward, be it through discoveries of new gold reserves or even through technological breakthroughs that make gold cheaper to make artificially . Bitcoin removes all doubt in its ability to remain a perfectly scarce asset as a result of its artificial scarcity. Even the rise of AI could indirectly support Bitcoin, as AI's growth may accelerate the digital transformation of finance. It will also likely lead to job automation and economic shifts that lead more people to seek stable, sovereign assets like Bitcoin. MicroStrategy is already keenly aware of the AI trend, as it was part of the reason why it rebranded to ""Strategy."" The company reasoned that ""Strategy"" was a more fitting name that highlights ""the two most transformative technologies of the 21st century: Bitcoin and AI."" Financial Engineering And Execution Excellence One of MicroStrategy's most underappreciated strengths is the financial engineering and execution behind its Bitcoin strategy. The company's management, let by CEO Michael Saylor and CFO Andrew Kang, has skillfully navigated capital markets to continually increase their Bitcoin holdings per share, which is a key metric to the success of MicroStrategy's strategy. After all, if existing shareholders can see their own individual Bitcoin exposure grow despite the company issuing equity to raise funds, MicroStrategy's model clearly works. MicroStrategy has even come up with a novel performance metric for this strategy called ""BTC Yield,"" which basically tracks the percentage growth in its bitcoin holdings relative to its diluted share count. In 2024, the company illustrated how accretive this financing strategy was by achieving a stunning 74.3% BTC Yield . In other words, MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings per share grew by 74.3%. Using such a metric, shareholders have an easy way to measure the success of the company by taking out the noise of dilution. MicroStrategy is able to increase ""BTC Yield"" through some relatively complex financial engineering of ""buying Bitcoin with other people's money."" Essentially, MicroStrategy issues long-dated debt at cheap rates that can convert to equity if the stock skyrockets, thereby leveraging its own stock volatility to acquire more Bitcoin. It's an incredibly high-wire act, but the execution so far has been near flawless. MicroStrategy has since deepened this strategy by issuing billions more in new convertible senior notes, along with introducing a ""Strike"" preferred stock series. This is all aimed at funding additional Bitcoin purchases. The company's ""21/21"" plan calls for raising $42 billion in total, with $21 billion coming from debt and $21 billion coming from equity/preferred by 2027. Notably, MicroStrategy has already secured $20 billion towards this goal, and has refinanced older debt into lower-coupon convertible notes in order to maintain a BTC Yield above 15%. Despite Growing Success, MicroStrategy is Still Incredibly Risky Despite MicroStrategy's enormous upside potential, the company is arguably one of the riskiest plays for a company of its valuation. First and foremost, Bitcoin's notorious volatility can wreak havoc on the company's stock in the short-medium term. We are already witnessing this as MicroStrategy's stock has regularly seen 10% intraday movements. This volatility is especially dangerous during downtrends, where MicroStrategy tends to exaggerate Bitcoin's losses due to its leveraged exposure. For instance, a 50% drop in Bitcoin prices could easily wipe out 80% of MicroStrategy's value. Liquidity and leverage also add another layer of risk. Even if Bitcoin's long-term prospects remained strong, if the asset were to collapse for an extended period of time, MicroStrategy would almost certainly face balance sheet strain given debt repayments down the road. The company's strategy of using equity issuance to pay down debt or buy new Bitcoin also means dilution, as existing shareholders are effectively bankrolling new Bitcoin purchases at the risk of their own ownership percentage. While this dilution has been accretive so far, evident in the company's BTC Yield metric, there is no guarantee that this will always hold true. The same feedback loop that works for MicroStrategy could actually work in reverse in a bear market. Finally, the ultimate risk would be that Bitcoin itself declines over the long term. Such a decline could be from any number of reasons, from growing investor apathy, the growing popularity of alternative cryptocurrencies, Government regulation, the threat posed by quantum computing , etc. At the end of the day, Bitcoin could easily be disrupted by newer technologies that take away investor attention or even make Bitcoin outright obsolete. Valuation Scenarios To illustrate why MicroStrategy is one of the most compelling plays in the market, we can model a few potential outcomes. If Bitcoin were to ~$200k and MicroStrategy executes on the remainder of its 21/21 Plan, the company's total stash of 900k BTC. At $200k per BTC, which is entirely realistic given Bitcoin's price appreciation history, this hoard will be worth $180 billion, implying more than 2x upside from MicroStrategy's current valuation. Of course, a significant drop in Bitcoin's price would also be equally devastating to MicroStrategy given its levered strategy. If Bitcoin were to drop to the $50k range, MicroStrategy's current BTC holdings would only be worth around ~$23.5B. In such a scenario, it would not be surprising to see MicroStrategy even trade at a discount to its BTC holdings, implying a 70-80% drop in the stock. At the end of the day, the driver of MicroStrategy's bull case remains the legitimacy of Bitcoin as an appreciating asset. The largest near-term catalyst for Bitcoin would be the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . If the Trump administration were to be successful in creating such a reserve, this would legitimize Bitcoin in a way that no other previous event has. What's more, this will also likely lead to a situation in which other nations and organizations race to establish their own Bitcoin reserves in anticipation of Bitcoin price rises or simply in attempts to diversify. Conclusion MicroStrategy offers investors an investment thesis that is as compelling as it is unconventional. Given how unique MicroStrategy's business model is, it is understandable why a large percentage of the investor community is incredibly wary of MicroStrategy. However, for those who believe in Bitcoin as the ultimate scarce asset, MicroStrategy is a proxy for an asset that is poised to reshape the global financial system. While the future is never certain, if Bitcoin is truly the ""'digital gold'"" for the 21st century, MicroStrategy could be one of the most compelling plays on the market right now at its current valuation of $75 billion.",MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-31 00:53:13

Analysts Tout Mutuum Finance (MUTM) To Trump ADA This Year,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-2-possible-in-march-analysts-tout-mutuum-finance-mutm-to-trump-ada-this-year/,"Cardano (ADA) rose 8% during the period between March 23 and March 25, attempting to break above the $0.76 resistance level for the third time in two weeks. Optimism from founder Charles Hoskinson’s campaign to promote network scalability and decentralization of governance hasn’t helped the token price remain buoyed, either, with ADA still 35% off its March 3 peak of $1.18. Speculations abound around partnerships with Trump-linked crypto ventures, but analysts wonder if ADA’s DeFi ecosystem can provide enough momentum to recover $1, much less $2. Instead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the go-to choice for investors seeking high upside potential for their cryptocurrency, whose presale is now in Phase 4 and a launch price 140% higher than presale. Cardano’s Uphill Battle And Cardano’s more recent price action hangs partly on political events. Donald Trump’s March 3 social media endorsement of ADA caused a rally, but later policy movements excluded altcoins from the U.S. Digital Asset reserves. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming DC Blockchain Summit 2025, at which Trump Jr. and Hoskinson will take the same stage. When looking ahead to what investors can expect in the future, some claim to look forward to partnerships with Trump-backed companies such as World Liberty Financial, whereas other critics describe these ventures as “pay-to-play” and not actually rooted in DeFi. Cardano’s layer-2 solution Hydra has recorded 1 million transactions per second in tests, and its eUTXO model claims base-layer transaction failures of zero—compared to Solana’s 40% failure rate. But DeFi adoption has been slow, leading protocol Indigo offers 28% yields on stablecoins but the returns which are paid in native tokens do not help the appeal. ADA’s ascent to $2, analysts say, hinges on demonstrable bumps in user activity and institutional inflows, neither of which have yet come to fruition. Mutuum Finance Gains Momentum While ADA suffers over the uncertainty of their future projects, it has little else to concern itself with compared to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which has attracted 7,400 investors who have so far contributed $5.7 million to its presale. Phase 4 tokens are priced at $0.025, with a 20% increase to $0.03 coming in Phase 5. With the listing price set at $0.06, that’s already secured 140% profits for pre-release buyers, and with post-launch projections of $3 mean it’ll be a 14,900% jump from this stage. Demand is driven by the project’s lending model. Users lock assets such as ETH or stablecoins into the platform, in exchange for interest-bearing mtTokens, which grow in value over time and can be traded on a range of DeFi platforms. MUTM tokens are continuously in demand from a buy-and-distribute mechanism where platform revenue is redirected to buy back MUTM tokens. In addition, overcollateralized loans and something that resembles peer to peer lending allows a greatly reduced systemic risk, appealing to conservative investors. Security and Incentives Mutuum Finance’s smart contract audit with Certik is almost done, with results to be published soon through official channels. The giveaway of 100,000 dollars to presale players, coupled with all this transparency, further cultivates confidence. Ten investors will take home $10,000 each as Phase 3 winds down fueling the FOMO even more. But as Cardano wrestles with execution of its technical strengths into market prevalence, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings together functionality and investor attraction. Its computed tokenomics and low presale entry point are concrete advantages over the speculative political gusts afflicting ADA. With Phase 4 in, gaining tokens for $0.025 becomes a narrow window phase which could be deciding for anyone ready for an exponential growth. Time To Act Cardano’s $2 target depends on the whims of some other forces altogether: regulatory changes, partnership announcements and DeFi adoption. That differs from Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which sets measurable goals, locking in presale profits and reporting a target of $3 post launch that aligns with analyst consensus. It is worth noting that Certik verification is in the final stage of assessment, with Phase 4 live, meaning to delay risk missing out on the lowest price available.

The cryptocurrency market is alive with new opportunities, and investors are flocking to fresh projects that could skyrocket. As the market continues to evolve, several meme coins are catching the eye of investors worldwide. In this article, we will take a deep dive into Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Floki Inu, and Bone ShibaSwap, highlighting their latest developments and potential for explosive growth. This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Floki Inu, and Bone ShibaSwap. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Glimpse into a Rewarding Investment Opportunity Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is fast becoming one of the most talked-about meme coins of 2025. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a newcomer to the world of cryptocurrencies, Arctic Pablo presents a unique opportunity. The presale of this token is especially enticing, with early investors set to reap potentially massive rewards. The project’s approach, including staking, referral incentives, and community competitions, is setting a high standard for what investors should expect from meme coins. APC offers a 66% APY during the presale, allowing investors to stake tokens and earn substantial rewards. Plus, the referral program allows you to spread the word about this exciting coin and earn even more. The community-centric competitions offer additional ways to earn APC tokens and USD rewards, making Arctic Pablo one of the most attractive opportunities in the meme coin market. One of the most compelling features of Arctic Pablo is its token burn mechanism, designed to enhance scarcity and value. Unsold tokens are burned each week during the presale, ensuring a deflationary environment. When the presale is over, any unsold tokens will also be burned, increasing the long-term sustainability and value of APC tokens. These transactions are recorded on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and reliability. The current presale price for Arctic Pablo Coin is just $0.000083, with a launch price of $0.008. That means early investors could see an ROI of over 9552.41% as the coin progresses to the listing price. With over $2 million raised so far and the project entering its 16th phase in Crystal Cove, there’s never been a better time to invest in Arctic Pablo Coin. The Presale Opportunity: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Unmatched Potential As Arctic Pablo reaches the Crystal Cove phase, the excitement is palpable. The presale is structured to provide maximum opportunities for early investors to secure their tokens at a low price before it inevitably rises. The project’s presale journey has already passed through 14 locations, and now, Crystal Cove is its current stop. During this presale stage, APC tokens are priced at an incredibly low $0.000083, giving investors the chance to purchase tokens before they increase in value. The Arctic Pablo presale is designed uniquely, without traditional stages. Instead, each “location” in its journey represents a significant phase of growth for the coin, building anticipation as the price continues to rise with every location. The token burn mechanism that’s in place adds another layer of value, ensuring that the total supply will gradually decrease, further enhancing the value of each token. By getting in early, you have the chance to secure an ROI of more than 9552.41%, from $0.000083 to the expected launch price of $0.008. With over $2 million raised so far, the momentum is building rapidly. As the meme coin presale continues, Arctic Pablo Coin is only becoming more valuable with each new phase. Get in now and position yourself to experience significant returns. Floki Inu: Latest Developments and Market Trends Floki Inu continues to make headlines as one of the most popular meme coins in the market. With its strong community-driven initiatives and exciting developments, Floki has cemented its position as a major player in the meme coin space. The recent introduction of the FlokiFi platform, a decentralized finance platform, has provided more utility for Floki Inu, enhancing its value and appeal to both investors and the wider crypto community. As Floki Inu continues to innovate, it remains one of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. Bone ShibaSwap: New Updates and Market Movement Bone ShibaSwap has seen a significant increase in activity as it continues to gain attention within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Recent updates include new partnerships and a growing user base for the ShibaSwap platform, which allows users to stake tokens, earn rewards, and participate in governance decisions. Bone ShibaSwap’s utility has expanded, making it an attractive asset for investors looking for more than just speculative gains. The token’s growth and the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s expansion make Bone ShibaSwap one of the standout meme coins of 2025. Final Thoughts: The Excitement Around Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale The world of meme coins is growing, and Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as a leader in this space. With its unique presale structure, token burn mechanism, staking rewards, and ROI potential, APC is a promising investment for anyone looking to capitalize on the top new meme coins to buy for 2025 . While Floki Inu and Bone ShibaSwap continue to make waves in the market, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale offers an exceptional opportunity to secure your position at an incredibly low price before it skyrockets.

With meme coin mania heating up again, one thing’s clear—early buyers are already stacking serious gains while others sit back watching. From Solana-based meme surges to Ethereum giants getting fresh utility layers, it’s a feeding frenzy out there. But here’s the kicker: the smartest plays aren’t even on the market yet—they’re in presales. That’s where BTFD Coin (BTFD) is flipping the game. Sitting in Stage 15 of 16, with a full P2E game already live, 2900% potential ROI, and a limited-time LAUNCH100 bonus deal, BTFD is quickly becoming the most talked-about meme coin presale. Combine that with strong movers like Notcoin (NOT) and Neiro (NEIRO), and you’ve got yourself a hitlist of the top new meme coins for exponential returns. Let’s break down why BTFD is at the top of the food chain—plus two other coins worth your radar. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Bull Market’s Secret Weapon Is in Presale Mode What if you could get 2x the tokens today, and a 2900% ROI tomorrow? That’s exactly what’s on the table right now with BTFD Coin , which is nearing the end of its presale run. At $0.0002 in Stage 15, just one final stage remains before launch. And when it lists at $0.0006, those who jumped in early could already 3x their investment. But it gets crazier… If BTFD hits its projected moon price of $0.006, that’s a mind-blowing 2900% ROI—turning small plays into monster gains. And yes, that kind of upside isn’t just hype—it’s fueled by the fundamentals: Live P2E Game : BTFD’s arcade-style game launched on January 1, 2025, and it’s not just fun—it’s paying users in crypto. Connect your wallet, play, earn tokens, and cash out or stake them. Staking Is Live : Since December 2, 2024, holders have been earning up to 90% APY just for locking their coins. Strong Community Backing : Over 11,600 Bulls have joined in, with more than 72 billion BTFD coins sold, pushing the presale tally past $6.43 million. Ethereum Backbone : BTFD runs on the Ethereum network with strong security and fast, cheap Layer 2 compatibility. BONUS ALERT: LAUNCH100 Ends March 30, 2025! Use the code LAUNCH100 and get 100% EXTRA coins—double your bag instantly! Here’s how: Head over to the BTFD Presale Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) Enter the code LAUNCH100 in the bonus field and apply. Choose your investment amount and confirm your purchase. Watch your tokens double instantly! Investment Scenario: Let’s say you invest $1500 in Stage 15 at $0.0002. That gets you 7.5 million BTFD coins. Use LAUNCH100, and you’re holding 15 million tokens. If BTFD reaches just its listing price of $0.0006, you’re sitting on $9,000. But if it rockets to $0.006? That’s a massive $90,000—from a $1500 play. Why is BTFD the first pick on this list of the top new meme coins for exponential returns? Because it’s one of the few meme coins with real utility, an active ecosystem, and a community that’s bullish before launch. The meme coin presale phase is almost over, and this might be your last golden ticket to get in before listings hit. 2. Notcoin (NOT): The Telegram Titan Turned Powerhouse Built straight out of the Telegram ecosystem, Notcoin (NOT) exploded onto the scene by gamifying user interaction. Unlike traditional meme coins, NOT made it cool to earn coins by just tapping a screen—blending addictive gaming mechanics with viral network effects. It recently gained traction through integrations with The Open Network (TON), making it more than just a tap-to-earn gimmick. With an upcoming mainnet transition and deeper DeFi compatibility in the pipeline, Notcoin’s appeal lies in how it continues to drive mass engagement while staying accessible. Why is Notcoin in this mix? Because it’s already captured millions of users and evolved into a scalable platform. NOT isn’t just a fad—it’s building something that holds up. 3. Neiro (NEIRO): The AI-Powered DeFi Disruptor Neiro proves that meme coins don’t have to be silly to succeed. This project merges artificial intelligence with decentralized finance, giving users smarter ways to manage their portfolios. It’s not all buzzwords either—Neiro’s AI tools are helping investors automate strategies, analyze market data, and enhance returns without lifting a finger. Currently making waves in the community for its ongoing beta testing and upcoming wallet release, NEIRO is appealing to a more strategic kind of meme coin investor—those looking to blend fun and function. Why does NEIRO deserve your attention among the top new meme coins for exponential returns? Because it’s built for the future of crypto—where AI meets DeFi in a way that feels effortless, smart, and profitable. Final Thoughts: The Bulls Are Already Charging—Will You? They say timing is everything in crypto. Right now, meme coins are getting hotter by the minute, and BTFD Coin is leading that charge with its high-utility model, live staking and gaming, and a presale that’s already breaking records. When analysts predict a 2900% ROI with real-world gaming and staking at 90% APY, smart investors listen. With Notcoin tapping into viral growth and Neiro adding AI intelligence to meme coin investing, you’ve got a mix of plays that covers hype, utility, and innovation. But only one of these is still under a penny, and only one is still in presale. Don’t let this one-stage window close on you. Visit the BTFD Presale Platform , claim your LAUNCH100 bonus, and join the Bulls Squad before it’s game over. This is your shot at catching one of the top new meme coins for exponential returns—before the rocket takes off.

42672358,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=702802,1743384708,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42672358.jpeg,Uniswap’s U.S. App Store ranking plummets amid declining trader activity,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/uniswaps-u-s-app-store-ranking-plummets/,"Uniswap’s ranking in the U.S. App Store’s finance category has dropped drastically, going from position 99 to 364 in the last two months. For most of 2024, Uniswap consistently ranked in the 190’s within the U.S. App Store’s finance category. The steep drop in Uniswap’s App Store ranking ignites discussions in the cryptocurrency world Following the election of pro-crypto President Donald Trump in the United States, Uniswap’s App Store ranking shot up to around 110th and later surged once more, reaching a record-breaking 99 when the president took office in January. However, Uniswap’s App Store ranking has drastically dropped since then, hitting even lower levels than in 2023. Though election hype helped to drive its rise, the platform’s fall has raised questions about more serious underlying issues. Of course, Uniswap wasn’t the only one to experience a post-election surge. A number of cryptocurrency apps also suddenly jumped in the rankings, but unlike Uniswap, most have since returned to their pre-election levels. SEC drops Uniswap probe, but large UNI transfers to Binance spark market concerns The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently dropped its probe into the firm. As per a Feb. 25 X post , the SEC concluded its investigation into Uniswap and has no plans to pursue enforcement action against the firm. The report followed Uniswap’s announcement that it received a Wells notice from the SEC in April 2024 while the commission was under the leadership of then-Chair Gary Gensler. “This is a huge win for DeFi and reaffirms what we’ve always known – that the technology we build is on the right side of the law, and our work is on the right side of history,” said Uniswap. Still, the number of traders using Uniswap on the Ethereum network has dropped by more than 45% since the start of 2025, falling from 69,680 to 37,000—the lowest since July 2023. Uniswap’s monthly trading volume also fell by 10% from December 2024 to January 2025, followed by another 22% drop the next month. Recent large transfers of UNI tokens to Binance have raised concerns about potential price pressure. On March 21, 2025, approximately 27.9 million UNI tokens were unlocked from Uniswap’s timelock contract, with significant portions subsequently moved to Binance. These transfers coincided with a 10% decline in UNI’s price, from $6.80 to $6.10. At the time of publication, Uniswap is trading at $5.79, a 2.5% decline in the last 24 hours. The bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with Ethereum hitting a 4-year low against BTC, likely contributed to UNI’s decline. Cryptocurrency apps secure top spots in the U.S. App Store finance rankings amid Trump’s memecoin trend The top three apps in the finance category of the U.S. App Store as of January 22 were all about cryptocurrencies. Among them were the online asset trading platforms Coinbase, Moonshot, and Crypto.com. Hence, cryptocurrency-related apps have taken over the top positions in the finance category of Apple’s App Store in the United States, defeating other apps. President Donald Trump’s meme coin trend quickly increased interest in crypto trading platforms, influencing cryptocurrency apps like Moonshot and Coinbase to secure top positions in the United States App Store finance rankings. In addition, the top 30 free apps in the finance category included other cryptocurrency apps, such as Coinbase Wallet, Robinhood, Binance.US, DEX Screener, and Kraken.

42672956,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=246707,1743386055,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis: 125% Surge in Options Trading Hints $2.50 Rebound This Week,https://coingape.com/markets/ripple-xrp-price-analysis-125-surge-in-options-trading-hints-2-50-rebound-this-week/,"XRP price is holding firm above $2 as traders position for a potential rebound, with derivatives data hinting at bullish momentum for the week ahead. Ripple (XRP) Holds Firm Above $2 as Markets Await Clarity Ripple (XRP) has endured volatile price action over the past week. XRP price closed the last three days of the week with 17% losses, plunging as low as $2.06 on Saturday, before bulls battled back to retake $2.10 at press time on March 31. Looking into the week ahead, market momentum hangs in the balance. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Crypto traders are awaiting clarity on the U.S. Congress confirmation process of Trump’s SEC chair nominee, Paul Atkins , a more crypto-friendly option to replace Gary Gensler. Amid concerns of conflicts of interest, investors will be closely watching. If Atkins’ confirmation faces rejection, many traders could begin selling, potentially driving Ripple price below $2 in the week ahead. 125% Surge in Options Trading Hints Positive Start to the Week While XRP held firm at the $2 support in the spot markets, traders appear to be placing optimistic bets in the derivatives markets. Coinglass ‘ latest data shows XRP options volume has surged by 125.93% to $7,540, while open interest grew 149.56% to $978,100. This significant increase suggests that investors are actively positioning for a strong move. Additionally, XRP’s long/short ratio of 0.9708 in the past 24 hours indicates a nearly balanced sentiment, slightly favouring long positions. Binance’s XRP/USDT long/short ratio for accounts stands at 3.1, signalling that traders on major exchanges expect a rebound. The top trader long/short ratio (accounts) on Binance is also at 2.8, further reinforcing this optimism. XRP Derivatives Markets Analysis, March 30 | Coinglass Another bullish signal is the 12-hour liquidation data, showing that $3.86M worth of long positions remained resilient compared to $1.78M short liquidations. This suggests that long traders are more confident in their positions, reducing the likelihood of a major sell-off. However, traders should remain cautious of the overall decline in trading volume, down 15.03% to $7.27B. This slowdown in market activity could limit XRP’s upside potential unless fresh catalysts emerge. At press time on Sunday, XRP price is showing resilience at $2, with derivatives traders placing bullish bets on a rebound. If positive momentum persists, XRP could target the $2.50 level in the coming week. However, regulatory uncertainty surrounding the SEC chair confirmation remains a key risk factor to watch. XRP Price Forecast: Bullish Breakout Could Send XRP to $2.50 Next Week XRP price forecast remains optimistic as the token holds steady above $2 despite the formation of a bearish pennant on the daily chart. The Parabolic SAR dots above the candles signal persistent bearish pressure, but the narrowing Keltner Channel (KC) suggests volatility is contracting, potentially setting up a sharp breakout. XRP price recently tested the lower KC boundary at $2.0273, reinforcing it as a key support level. XRP Price Forecast A bullish scenario emerges if XRP reclaims the middle KC line at $2.3043. A decisive close above this level could drive momentum toward the upper boundary at $2.58, paving the way for a $2.50 retest next week. Increasing options open interest from derivatives traders further strengthens the case for an upside move. However, a breakdown below $2.02 could invalidate this outlook. A daily close below this level may trigger further liquidations, exposing XRP price to the $1.90 zone. With volume declining and bearish formations still dominant, bulls must reclaim $2.30 quickly to confirm the reversal. Until then, XRP traders should watch for sustained momentum shifts before committing to a firm directional bias.

This trend isn’t isolated—the recent PI coin price drop reflects similar setbacks, linked to delays by major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. Amid these challenges, BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing attention with its dynamic approach. Its latest AMA introduced a $60K Testnet Incentive Campaign aimed at boosting engagement and testing the network’s capabilities prior to its Token Generation Event. This move has energized both new and existing holders, sparking significant demand for BDAG. TRON (TRX) Price Analysis: From Profit Peak to Steady Decline Recent TRON (TRX) price analysis reveals a substantial decrease—nearly 50% from its 2024 peak—yet it remains a top performer among layer-1 networks. Despite the downturn, TRON amassed over $700 million in 2025, surpassing competitors like Ethereum and Solana. Furthermore, TRON’s deflationary approach continues to burn more tokens than are created, effectively reducing its overall supply and potentially underpinning its value over time. The TRON price analysis also identifies a falling wedge pattern, which traditionally suggests potential for future gains. However, the real test for TRON will be demonstrating enduring value beyond transient trading patterns. PI Coin Price Drop Signals Market Skepticism & Reduced Activity The recent PI coin price drop has become a focal point after sinking below the $1 mark, recording an 18% decrease within a single day. Central to this downturn are the protracted delays in gaining listings on prominent exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, which have dampened the initial enthusiasm. Additionally, the deflationary forces are at play with over 528,000 tokens eliminated through transaction fees, and further supply contractions caused by unverified accounts. Although a diminishing supply can often bolster prices, it has yet to offset the prevailing negative outlook. The PI coin price drop is also paralleled by a 37% reduction in trade volume. BlockDAG’s Pre-TGE Momentum Grows with $60K Testnet Campaign BlockDAG recently unveiled a significant initiative as part of its preparation for the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE)—a Testnet Incentive Campaign. This campaign is crafted to assess network performance under realistic conditions by inviting user participation in a controlled environment. The campaign simulates operational conditions expected after the TGE, providing both developers and users the opportunity to engage with decentralized applications (dApps) and monitor network response under actual usage scenarios. The aim is to ensure a smooth and functional operation once the TGE is implemented. Featuring a targeted approach to engagement and rewards, the campaign will distribute $60,000 in total, with $2,000 going to each of 30 winners. These participants will be selected based on their activity levels, mining contributions, and wallet balances, aligning with the objective to stimulate robust network activity akin to a live environment. The announcement of this campaign has notably increased presale activities, with both new and existing participants eager to stake their claims. This enthusiasm has propelled BlockDAG’s metrics significantly, with over $208.5 million raised, 18.9 billion BDAG sold, and a 2,380% price increase noted since the initial offer. Presently priced at $0.0248 in the 27th batch, BlockDAG is rapidly gaining recognition as the best crypto to buy now due to its strategic execution and increasing demand as the TGE approaches. Market Trends and Strategic Moves While TRON continues to lead in profit generation, recent TRON price analysis highlights a struggle to regain its previous high following a substantial dip. Similarly, the PI coin price drop mirrors this downturn, exacerbated by missed listings on prominent exchanges, which have negatively impacted market sentiment. Amid these market fluctuations, BlockDAG’s community is seeing consistent growth. The recent AMA about the $60K Testnet Incentive Campaign has not only attracted a flood of new participants, pushing the presale past $208.5 million, but has also demonstrated the campaign’s effectiveness in fostering long-term engagement. With BDAG priced at just $0.0248 in the current batch and a TGE on the horizon, the potential for growth is substantial. The combination of strategic timing, transparent operations, and a well-mapped development plan positions BlockDAG as a compelling candidate for the best crypto to buy now .

With ETH hovering near $1,870, the liquidation trigger points—$1,805 and $1,787—are alarmingly close. These vaults have a health ratio barely above 1.00, meaning a sharp dip could flood the market with auto-sold ETH, intensifying downside pressure. While Maker grapples with risk management, Ethena Labs is making a different move. Its new sUSDe pool on Pendle adds real-world yield utility to ENA’s token, potentially offsetting the negative sentiment from its recent token unlock. The pool’s success could indicate stronger mid-term fundamentals. Yet, BlockDAG is already where others want to be. Keynote 3 confirmed its entire DeFi suite—staking, swaps, lending, and more—will go live at mainnet, not sometime post-launch. That’s rare. Backed by a $208M presale and $5M raised in just 48 hours, BlockDAG is showing it’s not just promising utility—it’s building it right now. $238M at Risk: Maker Vaults Face Liquidation as ETH Nears Danger Zone Two Ethereum whales are on the edge of losing $238 million worth of collateralized ETH as prices slump. According to Lookonchain, the whales have locked over 125,000 ETH in Maker vaults while borrowing $143.68 million in DAI. If ETH drops below $1,805 and $1,787, both vaults will be liquidated. With health ratios at 1.05 and 1.06—just above the critical 1.00 mark—the threat of forced liquidation is real. If triggered, the ETH will be auto-sold to cover debt, putting downward pressure on price. ETH is currently trading at $1,870, down 2.2% in 24 hours. Unless these whales inject more collateral, their positions could unravel fast. Ethena Launches New sUSDe Pool with Pendle—Will ENA Demand Rise? Ethena Labs has rolled out a new sUSDe yield pool in partnership with Pendle, running from March 25 to July 31, 2025. This move could draw in yield-hungry investors and deepen liquidity on Ethereum. The extended window gives market participants time to engage, and if the pool gains traction, it could signal stronger user confidence in Ethena’s ecosystem—potentially driving more demand for ENA tokens. With ENA already under the spotlight due to its massive token unlock, this added utility through yield farming may play a key role in shaping its mid-term price direction. Watch how much capital flows into the pool and the returns offered—those metrics could hint at where ENA is heading next. BlockDAG to Launch Full DeFi Suite—$5M Raised in 48 Hours Says It All BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 didn’t just showcase a testnet—it laid out a clear blueprint for becoming a DeFi powerhouse. One of the standout moments was the confirmation that full DeFi functionality will be available at mainnet launch. That includes staking, swaps, lending, bridges, and governance tools—built directly into the ecosystem from day one. Unlike most Layer 1s that roll these out slowly post-launch, BlockDAG is aiming to hit the ground running, giving users immediate financial utility. This aggressive rollout is backed by serious momentum. In just 48 hours, BlockDAG raised $5 million, bringing its total presale to over $208 million. With BDAG priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27, investors are clearly seeing the upside—especially with over 19 billion tokens sold and DeFi tools coming online soon. These fundamentals position BlockDAG to compete directly with Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche—not just on speed, but on real usability. The market is responding in kind, and if this pace continues, BDAG could emerge as one of the top DeFi-ready Layer 1s of the year. For those looking to enter early, the signals couldn’t be louder. This is the breakout moment. Takeaway The Ethereum liquidation alert reveals just how fragile large leveraged positions can become in uncertain markets. MakerDAO may weather the storm, but if ETH breaks key levels, it could trigger a cascade with broad implications. Ethena’s Pendle integration adds needed use-case depth, but whether that offsets the risk from its $3.29B unlock remains to be seen. Both ETH and ENA are playing defense—for now. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is executing like it’s already live. Its full DeFi suite isn’t a roadmap ambition—it’s a confirmed launch feature. While competitors gradually release functionality, BlockDAG is packaging it all into its mainnet debut. That alone gives BDAG a unique edge in both time-to-market and user readiness.

However, its sluggish growth, high transaction fees, and scalability challenges have left investors searching for more efficient alternatives. Despite ongoing upgrades like the Ethereum (ETH) 2.0, the network still faces congestion and fierce competition from newer blockchain projects that offer faster speeds and lower costs. As a result, savvy investors, often called “smart money,” are exploring undervalued crypto assets with stronger growth potential. One such emerging crypto, RCO Finance (RCOF), is gaining significant attention due to its solid fundamentals, unique value proposition, and growing investor interest. As Ethereum (ETH) growth slows in the market, the migration of capital into this undervalued asset signals a significant shift in the crypto landscape. The Current Market Performance Of Ethereum Despite its foundational role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, Ethereum has faced challenges impacting its market performance in the crypto space. As of late, Ethereum’s price has declined, with significant selling pressure pushing it below key support levels. According to available data on CoinGecko , ETH has lost over 23% in the past 30 days. This downturn has been attributed to various factors, including network congestion, high transaction fees, and competition from emerging blockchain platforms. RCO Finance: The Emerging Undervalued Crypto Asset In light of Ethereum’s stagnation, investors are turning their attention to RCO Finance, an innovative DeFi platform that uses new-generation technologies to revolutionize the decentralized finance market. The platform’s solid fundamentals and real-world utility set its token, RCOF, up for a potentially massive rally in the coming months. More investors and analysts are shifting their focus toward RCO Finance (RCOF), recognizing it as a promising asset capable of outperforming Ethereum (ETH) in terms of market growth. At the core of RCO Finance’s groundbreaking approach lies its AI-enhanced trading ecosystem, designed to help traders efficiently navigate the complexities of decentralized finance (DeFi). A standout feature of this system is the AI-driven Robo Advisor, a sophisticated tool that continuously processes real-time market data to develop strategic investment insights for optimal returns. Employing advanced algorithms, this AI-powered assistant detects lucrative trading opportunities before they gain mainstream attention, giving investors a vital advantage. For example, the $Jelly token recently experienced an 181% surge within a single day, an opportunity many traders failed to ride on. The Robo Advisor provides early alerts for such high-value movements, allowing investors to act before the broader market reacts. Additionally, RCO Finance’s AI technology is a key player in risk mitigation. Its real-time monitoring system issues alerts to help traders safeguard their assets from sudden market fluctuations. A recent example is the $SATS token , which saw a sharp 24% drop in just 24 hours. RCOF’s proactive risk management tools could have anticipated this event. RCO Finance integrates real-time financial data from trusted sources like Bloomberg and Reuters to further enhance its reliability. This direct access to verified market intelligence enables traders to make well-informed, data-driven decisions ahead of market shifts. Beyond trading, RCO Finance is a pioneer in asset tokenization, allowing fractional ownership of high-value assets, including real estate, commodities, and other premium investments. The platform boasts an extensive portfolio of over 120,000 assets spanning 12,500 categories, such as tokenized stocks, digital assets, commodities, etc. Another defining feature of RCO Finance is its dedication to privacy. RCOF prioritizes user privacy, allowing transactions to occur without invasive identity checks. This ensures a secure and unrestricted trading experience while maintaining financial privacy. With its state-of-the-art AI-powered trading tools, cutting-edge risk management system, and innovative asset tokenization framework, RCO Finance is revolutionizing the DeFi landscape. As momentum builds, industry professionals increasingly view the crypto token as a standout investment opportunity set to outperform Ethereum (ETH). RCOF Beta: A Sneak Peek Into the Future of DeFi RCO Finance (RCOF) has introduced its beta platform , offering early users an exclusive first look at its cutting-edge features before the official launch. With a growing community of over 10,000 active participants, this beta phase is crucial in optimizing the platform’s functionality and overall user experience. By actively engaging with feedback from early adopters, RCOF is fine-tuning its ecosystem to enhance efficiency, streamline operations, and deliver maximum value. The enthusiastic response from beta testers underscores the platform’s growing influence in the DeFi space. As RCO Finance gains momentum and continues to attract a rapidly expanding user base, its growing potential becomes even more evident. With a strong focus on innovation, user-driven development, and a commitment to advancing DeFi, RCOF is emerging as one of the most compelling investment opportunities in the crypto market. RCOF Presale: An Opportunity You Shouldn’t Miss As the Ethereum (ETH) price continues to struggle, crypto assets like RCOF present a good investment opportunity for smart money to capitalize. The RCOF presale is already in its fifth stage and has crossed the $12 million mark in total funds raised. As this phase nears its final stretch, the token price is set to increase from $0.10 to $0.13, presenting a prime opportunity for investors to join the presale and secure a lower entry point before the price increases in the next stage. Financial analysts anticipate significant growth potential, estimating that an early investment of just $1,000 could skyrocket to over $395,650 by Q2 2025. The RCO Finance team is gearing up for a $100,000 giveaway once they cross the $250,000 mark to celebrate the presale’s success and reward its early supporters. This initiative further demonstrates the project’s commitment to fostering a loyal and engaged investor community. In its ongoing efforts to prioritize security and transparency, RCOF has undergone a comprehensive smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof, a highly respected and renowned blockchain security company. This rigorous security check reinforces the platform’s reliability, ensuring that investors can confidently participate, knowing top-tier security protocols safeguard their assets.

Amid the buzz are innovative projects like Bitcoin Pepe that are gaining traction as early bidders make savvy moves. As top money flows into the crypto market again, the meme layer-2 solution for Bitcoin is galloping in presale with over $5.7 million raised so far. Confidence in the market has also seen a whale, undeterred by a more than $15 million loss on a previous trade, double down on Official Trump (TRUMP). However, could Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) be a better bullish bet? BPEP presale so far – $5.7 million and rising Bitcoin Pepe’s presale has gained significant momentum in the past week. Now in stage 8 of a 30-stage sale, the project’s token presale has so far hit $5.7 million. Interest in the innovative meme coin project has the native BPEP token trending, with its presale price at $0.0281. Ease of presale participation – one can buy BPEP using any of ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or SOL – is making it easy for more enthusiasts to take part. Andrea Burel @MAYCOL79 · Follow $bpep Watch on Twitter View replies 7:40 pm · 29 Mar 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter New momentum amid this rapid fundraising reflects a strong interest in Bitcoin Pepe’s vision to integrate meme coins with Bitcoin’s security. This underscores growing confidence in meme coins, particularly as Bitcoin Pepe positions itself as a project building Solana on Bitcoin. Whales making bold moves across the market only reinforces the bullish outlook. TRUMP – whale makes another bet The Official Trump (TRUMP) token entered the crypto space with a bang earlier this year, riding on US President Donald Trump’s inauguration. While the token plummeted afterward amid the scandalous launches of MELANIA and LIBRA tokens, a whale is making a fresh bet on TRUMP. According to details Onchain Lens shared on X, a crypto whale, previously hit with a $15.72 million loss on TRUMP, is doubling down on the trade. The investor recently spent $3.41 million to buy 333,664 TRUMP tokens, with the average purchase price of $10.22 per token. Is this a strategic bet on TRUMP that could pay off significantly? Or are projects like Bitcoin Pepe a better move? Why is Bitcoin Pepe potentially a great opportunity? Bitcoin Pepe stands out with its meme layer-2 for Bitcoin, mimicking Solana’s speed and low costs while leveraging Bitcoin’s security. Per the project’s whitepaper , the opportunity that BPEP offers “isn’t subtle.” The team points to meme coins hitting $100 billion in market cap without BTC. On the other hand, Bitcoin at its peak was a $2 trillion ecosystem without memes. Notably, Bitcoin Pepe wants to set the pace as the first project to merge these two market segments. The project introduces the PEP-20 token standard, enabling anyone to create meme coins natively on Bitcoin. Currently, BPEP is available for scooping at $0.0295 in stage 8.

Community members across Latin America and beyond are pouring into digital assets not just for diversification—but for the kind of upside legacy systems simply can’t offer. With blockchain innovations heating up, many are hunting for the best cryptos for exponential returns, and 2025 might just deliver on that wild potential. While some projects have already carved their place in the crypto hall of fame, others are on the verge of breakout status. Qubetics (TICS), Quant (QNT), and Astra are three names bouncing around serious circles lately. Each brings something unique to the table—but Qubetics is the one lighting up the charts with massive presale traction and analyst chatter about a possible 100x surge. Let’s unpack how these three digital assets stack up for those eyeing the best cryptos for exponential returns this year. Qubetics (TICS): Building a Marketplace for Tokenized Real-World Assets Qubetics isn’t here to play small. This next-gen blockchain project is aiming to crack a multitrillion-dollar nut: real-world asset tokenization. From real estate to invoices, art, equity, and even intellectual property—Qubetics is building a sleek, secure, and borderless marketplace where anything of value can be tokenized, traded, and fractionalized in real time. Here’s where it hits different: imagine a boutique hotel owner in Cartagena tokenizing room bookings for high season and offering them as tradable digital assets. Or a coffee farmer in Colombia minting tokens backed by future harvests and selling them directly to international buyers. A lawyer in Santiago could even tokenize their firm’s receivables, unlocking instant liquidity without groveling at the feet of a slow-moving bank. For professionals, businesses, and everyday backers, this unlocks access to previously illiquid markets, turbocharging access to capital and opportunity. And because it’s all baked into the Qubetics protocol, users can mint, validate, and transfer real-world assets using just a smartphone and some basic onboarding. In a space obsessed with hype, Qubetics is building hard-hitting utility—exactly why many crypto heads are calling it one of the best cryptos for exponential returns in 2025. This isn’t about buzzwords; it’s about problem-solving at scale. And the excitement? Justified. Qubetics Presale & Analyst ROI Forecasts The presale metrics are jaw-dropping. The crypto presale is in its 28th presale stage , with 504 million+ tokens sold to a thriving base of over 23,900 holders . The campaign has already raised more than $15.5 million , and each $TICS token is currently going for just $0.1430 . Analysts are all over this one. Their projections? $TICS at $1 means a 599% ROI . At $5, that shoots to 3396% ROI . $6 delivers 4095% ROI , while $10 smashes in 6892% ROI . And if Qubetics hits $15 after mainnet launch, that’s a staggering 10,388% ROI —turning early backers into serious players. For anyone scanning the horizon for the best cryptos for exponential returns , Qubetics is arguably the most hyped yet fundamentally sound shot at triple-digit gains. With token utility, real-world use cases, and red-hot presale numbers, it’s no surprise it’s being compared to the early days of Ethereum and Solana. Quant (QNT): Enterprise Blockchain Without the Buzzwords Quant is one of those projects that doesn’t need to scream to be taken seriously. Known across institutional and technical circles as the bridge between blockchains and legacy financial systems, Quant has built its reputation by quietly solving one of crypto’s biggest headaches: interoperability. Quant’s Overledger Network allows businesses, governments, and fintech platforms to seamlessly interact across multiple blockchains. So instead of choosing between Ethereum, Bitcoin, or Hyperledger, Quant lets systems work across them all—securely and simultaneously. That’s a big deal. For Latin American central banks flirting with CBDCs, or fintech startups in São Paulo looking to roll out multi-chain applications, Quant offers enterprise-grade reliability with the agility of modern Web3 infrastructure. It’s why Quant keeps finding itself in conversations with top-tier institutions around the world. No wonder community participants consider it a staple in any diversified blockchain strategy. Among mature crypto circles, Quant has earned the respect of backers who don’t fall for gimmicks. It’s known for compliance, reliability, and its focus on real-world enterprise use cases—everything from digital identity to cross-border settlement. It might not make daily headlines like meme coins do, but it doesn’t have to. Its position is solid, and its growth is steady. For those looking at the best cryptos for exponential returns , Quant may not promise 100x in a month, but it offers a unique angle: sustainable, infrastructure-first growth that large-scale partners are already using. And that kind of consistency is golden, especially in volatile markets. Astra: The Web3 Gateway for Data-Driven Applications Astra plays in a different league. It’s not trying to be a “do-it-all” chain—it’s positioning itself as the bedrock for data-driven decentralized applications (dApps), particularly in emerging markets. And it’s starting to show up in places where blockchain’s real impact can be felt—education, healthcare, and secure identity systems. The Astra protocol is designed for efficiency, low fees, and fast confirmation times, making it ideal for building out high-traffic applications without gas headaches. This makes it a favorite among developers in Latin America where infrastructure is often stretched thin and high fees can be a blocker. Think about a school system in Lima using Astra to verify student credentials on-chain. Or a mobile app in Mexico City offering digital health passports and insurance tracking using smart contracts. This kind of localized, real-world integration is what’s giving Astra its edge—and helping it rank among the best cryptos for exponential returns over the coming years. It’s also being used in community-driven projects like municipal budgeting tools, allowing transparency and real-time feedback between citizens and their local governments. That kind of impact doesn’t just build credibility—it builds demand. And when platforms demand native tokens for services and security, utility kicks into high gear. Astra may not have Quant’s institutional flair or Qubetics’ ROI buzz, but it’s carving out a clear niche. Among developers, civil tech advocates, and grassroots crypto communities, it’s become the platform of choice. That kind of adoption? It’s not loud, but it’s sticky. Conclusion There’s a reason crypto continues to eat into traditional finance’s dominance—it offers freedom, speed, and innovation at a level the old system can’t match. And in the hunt for the best cryptos for exponential returns , it’s becoming clear that strong fundamentals and real-world impact are separating the contenders from the pretenders. Qubetics brings game-changing use cases through tokenized real-world assets, a booming presale, and eye-watering ROI forecasts. Quant offers backbone-level infrastructure that institutions trust. And Astra is quietly empowering the next wave of decentralized applications in underserved markets. For those still on the fence, here’s the thing: the doors to Qubetics’ presale aren’t going to stay open forever. Once $TICS hits major exchanges, the entry price—and the ROI potential—will shift. Meanwhile, Quant and Astra continue building strong foundations in their own lanes. Now’s the time to act. Don’t just watch the future of finance unfold—be part of it. Explore the platforms making headlines for all the right reasons. These aren’t just coins—they’re catalysts.

Threat Fabric analysts said in a March 28 report that the Crocodilus malware uses a screen overlay warning users to back up their crypto wallet key by a specific deadline or risk losing access. “Once a victim provides a password from the application, the overlay will display a message: Back up your wallet key in the settings within 12 hours. Otherwise, the app will be reset, and you may lose access to your wallet,” Threat Fabric said. “This social engineering trick guides the victim to navigate to their seed phrase wallet key, allowing Crocodilus to harvest the text using its accessibility logger.” Source: Threat Fabric Once the threat actors have the seed phrase, they can seize complete control of the wallet and “drain it completely.” Threat Fabric says despite it being a new malware, Crocodilus has all the features of modern banking malware, with overlay attacks, advanced data harvesting through screen capture of sensitive information such as passwords and remote access to take control of the infected device. Initial infection occurs by inadvertently downloading the malware in other software that bypasses Android 13 and security protections, according to Threat Fabric. Once installed, Crocodilus requests accessibility service to be enabled, which enables the hackers to gain access to the device. “Once granted, the malware connects to the command-and-control (C2) server to receive instructions, including the list of target applications and the overlays to be used,” Threat Fabric said. Once installed, Crocodilus requests accessibility service to be enabled, granting hackers access to the device. Source: Threat Fabric It runs continuously, monitoring app launches and displaying overlays to intercept credentials. When a targeted banking or cryptocurrency app is opened, the fake overlay launches over the top and mutes the sound while the hackers take control of the device. “With stolen PII and credentials, threat actors can take full control of a victim’s device using built-in remote access, completing fraudulent transactions without detection,” Threat Fabric said. Threat Fabrix’s Mobile Threat Intelligence team has found the malware targets users in Turkey and Spain but said the scope of use will likely broaden over time. Related: Beware of ‘cracked’ TradingView — it’s a crypto-stealing trojan They also speculate the developers could speak Turkish, based on the notes in the code, and added that a threat actor known as Sybra or another hacker testing out new software could be behind the malware. “The emergence of the Crocodilus mobile banking Trojan marks a significant escalation in the sophistication and threat level posed by modern malware.” “With its advanced Device-Takeover capabilities, remote control features, and the deployment of black overlay attacks from its earliest iterations, Crocodilus demonstrates a level of maturity uncommon in newly discovered threats,” Threat Fabric added.

I'm upgrading the stock to a buy rating. Altcoin prices have shown resilience relative to Bitcoin's sharper drop, which may mean Coinbase's trading revenue won't fall as much as feared. Continued innovation, such as Coinbase One Premium at $300/month and Bitcoin-backed loans, is driving growth in non-transactional recurring revenue streams. Coinbase has also fallen to a very attractive ~9x forward adjusted EBITDA multiple, quite a modest valuation for such a high-growth company. Just a few months ago, the sentiment around Coinbase ( COIN ) and the crypto industry immediately after Trump’s re-election was all euphoria. Crypto investors cheered Trump’s embrace of crypto and promise to make the U.S. the “world capital of crypto,” alongside more friendly regulatory expectations and the establishment of a U.S. crypto reserve. All of these promises still hold. And yet, Bitcoin has tumbled ~20% from peaks, magnifying losses in the S&P 500 and defying the traditional logic that crypto should be a low-correlation asset that can be used as a market hedge, like gold. And against that backdrop, Coinbase has lost 30% of its value since the start of January. Data by YCharts In my view, this is a good juncture for investors to re-assess the bull case for Coinbase. I last wrote a neutral opinion on the stock in January , when Coinbase was still trading near $260. Today, with the stock more than 30% lower, I believe the recent sharp drop has more than compensated Coinbase for any added risk from the recent market turmoil. Though long on the sidelines for this stock due in large part to valuation concerns, I’m much more bullish on Coinbase at its lower prices. As such, I’m upgrading the stock to a buy rating. To me, all the structural and regulatory factors that drove the post-election surge, such as the establishment of a federal crypto reserve, still hold - and we don’t rehash those long-term drivers here. We’ll focus instead on what makes Coinbase a good buy on the dip, based on what has recently changed for the company: relative stability of altcoin prices (relative to BTC), continued innovation that will help to boost Coinbase’s more reliable subscription/services revenue stream, and a more benign valuation. Let’s now go through each of these factors in turn. Q4 trading revenue was on fire; Q1 won’t be bad as feared For investors who are newer to Coinbase, note that the company generates revenue across two distinct streams. Roughly 70% of Coinbase’s revenue derives from the spreads it earns on facilitating trading, while the remaining 30% is a more reliable stream of revenue from subscription fees, mining rewards, custodial fees, and interest. We’ll focus first on the trading portion, which, needless to say, enjoyed a huge burst of activity in the post-election period. In the most recently reported quarter, Q4, Coinbase reported $1.56 billion of transactional revenue, up roughly 3x y/y. Coinbase Q4 results (Coinbase Q4 shareholder letter) Needless to say, this is the lion’s share of the company’s revenue, and given the strict volatility and unpredictability of this activity, Coinbase explicitly does not provide any guidance for this revenue line - it only provides an outlook for subscription/services revenue as well as its expense ratios. Coinbase’s sharp ~30% fall since the start of the year is a reflection of investors’ fear that the pullback in crypto markets (and in risk-taking in general) will dent the company’s recent blazing growth trends. And while it’s true that growth rates will likely decelerate meaningfully from the 194% y/y that the company achieved in Q4, it’s likely to be better than feared. First - in the company’s Q4 shareholder letter, the company noted that it already earned “approximately $750 million” in trading revenue through February 11, or 42 trading days of the 88-day quarter. Of course, trading is volatile, and market losses picked up in late February - but if we do a simple extrapolation of February trends through the remainder of the quarter, we’d get anywhere from $1.5-$1.6 billion in revenue for the quarter, roughly ~40-50% growth versus $1.08 billion in the prior-year Q1. In other words, recent trends through mid-quarter are still pointing to shape double-digit y/y growth rates in trading revenue. Second: it’s important to note that while the large and best-known coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum make up the lion’s share of trading activity on the platform, they’re not the biggest chunk of revenue. Coinbase actually makes higher spreads on smaller altcoins. See the chart below: for the full year FY24, 57% of Coinbase’s revenue came from “other crypto assets” (not specifically defined as BTC, ETH, or XRP), versus just a 43% share of trading volume. Coinbase trading share by type and coin (Coinbase Q4 shareholder letter) Why this is important is because in the recent correction, it appears that the largest altcoins have had relatively better price stability than Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is down ~20% from peaks at $103k. Ethereum is down more than 50% from December peaks, just shy of $4k. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) which in the fourth quarter grew to a 14% share of Coinbase’s trading revenue (a bit over half of Bitcoin’s share, and generating more revenue than Ethereum), is actually flat to where it started the year, though down from February peaks in the high $2s. XRP price chart ( CoinMarketCap ) BNB (the 5th largest coin with a ~$90 billion market cap) is only down ~10% from December/January levels in the high $600s. BNB price chart ( CoinMarketCap ) The point here is that, by and large, it seems that crypto assets outside of Bitcoin have enjoyed greater price stability in this downturn - and since these are the coins that generate wider spreads for Coinbase, the company’s trading revenue growth might not drop as sharply as feared. Continued innovation is driving subscription fees Beyond the hope of continued growth in trading revenue, we also like the fact that Coinbase continues to develop its capabilities to continue growing its non-transactional recurring revenue base. One major initiative is Coinbase One, the company’s subscription membership. Over the past year, Coinbase has introduced the premium membership in more countries, which has helped the company’s international revenue contribution climb to 19% in Q4, up 3 points y/y. Though it doesn’t provide regular subscriber metrics each quarter, the company notes that it has passed the 600k subscriber mark, up “more than 50%” since Q1 of 2024. The final y also recently unveiled a new Coinbase One Premium tier, priced at a hefty $300/month and giving users access to unlimited zero trading fees and richer USDC wallet rewards. This is an offering that caters to true crypto professional traders. Rewards for holding USDC are also new, giving users more incentive to purchase and hold the USD-backed stablecoin (while Coinbase earns lucrative interest spreads on funds held). Coinbase also recently released loans backed by Bitcoin, which is an innovative application of blockchain technology. Bitcoin holders now also have the opportunity to “leverage” their bitcoins held in Coinbase and receive U.S. dollar-based loans, allowing them to access liquidity without selling their holdings and triggering capital gains. The company also continues to step up its offerings for institutional clients, which have increasingly waded into the crypto markets and following the new administration’s direction that crypto will be favorably looked upon and regulated. Institutional volumes more than doubled y/y in Q4. Per CFO Alesia Hess’s remarks on the Q4 earnings call: Our institutional trading volume was $345 billion, up 128%, also outperforming the U.S. spot market. Institutional transaction revenue was $141 million, up 156%. In the fourth quarter, we saw strong adoption of the Prime product suite. Across custody, trading, financing, and staking, our top clients are engaged with most of these products in 2024, and our onboarding pipeline remains robust. Our Prime financing product had all-time high loan balances in the fourth quarter in connection with the strong market conditions, and we see elevated trading amongst clients who are using financing.” In my view, all of these moves (especially the rollout of a professional-tier Coinbase One subscription) will help to diversify Coinbase’s revenue into steadier streams that reduce its dependence on volatile consumer trading. Valuation, risks, and key takeaways The biggest impetus to buy Coinbase now, however, is the fact that its valuation finally appears to have fallen to very reasonable levels. At current share prices near $174, Coinbase trades at a $44.16 billion market cap. After we net off the $9.82 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and USDC on Coinbase’s most recent balance sheet (and not counting ~$1.55 billion of other crypto assets held for investment) against $4.23 billion in debt, Coinbase’s resulting enterprise value is $38.57 billion. For FY25, Wall Street is currently expecting Coinbase to generate $8.12 billion in revenue, or 24% y/y growth. If we assume a 51% adjusted EBITDA margin on this revenue profile (a conservative assumption of flat margins to FY24), adjusted EBITDA would be $4.14 billion (+24% y/y). This puts Coinbase’s valuation multiples at: 4.8x EV/FY25 revenue 9.3x EV/FY25 adjusted EBITDA To me, a single-digit EBITDA multiple for a company that is on track to sustain double-digit growth in revenue this year, with plenty of secular tailwind for greater crypto adoption (particularly by institutions) is quite compelling. Of course, there are risks we need to keep in mind. The crypto community has long embraced a buy-and-hold (or “hodl”) mentality during downturns. Despite my earlier assertion that altcoins’ price has dipped more modestly compared to bitcoin, the nervous market environment overall could persuade more crypto owners to simply hold their positions rather than trade, reducing trading volumes and Coinbase’s revenue. This being said, however, I like the continued expansion of Coinbase’s non-trading revenue streams, and to me, risks are already more than embedded into the stock’s currently discounted price.

MARA Holdings, formerly Marathon Digital, said in a March 28 Form 8-K and prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it entered into an at-the-market agreement with investment giants, including Cantor Fitzgerald and Barclays, for them to sell up to $2 billion worth of its stock “from time to time.” “We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” MARA added. MARA’s move copies a tactic made famous by Bitcoin ( BTC ) bull Saylor, the executive chair of the largest corporate Bitcoin holder Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy, which has used a variety of market offerings, including stock sales, to amass 506,137 BTC worth $42.4 billion. MARA Holdings falls just behind Strategy with the second largest holdings by a public company, with 46,374 BTC worth around $3.9 billion in its coffers, according to Bitbo data. In July, the company’s CEO, Fred Thiel, said it was going “full HODL” and wouldn’t sell any of the Bitcoin it mined to fund its operations, as is typical for crypto miners, and would purchase more of the cryptocurrency to keep in reserve. Related: Crusoe to sell Bitcoin mining business to NYDIG to focus on AI The Bitcoin ( BTC ) miner’s planned stock sale follows a similar offering it made early last year that offered up to $1.5 billion worth of its shares. It also issued $1 billion of zero-coupon convertible senior notes in November with plans to use most of the proceeds to buy Bitcoin. Google Finance shows that MARA closed the March 28 trading day down 8.58% at $12.47, following on from crypto mining stocks being rattled a day earlier with reports that Microsoft abandoned plans to invest in new data centers in the US and Europe. MARA shares have fallen another 4.6% to $11.89 in overnight trading on March 30, according to Robinhood.

This follows a breakdown from consolidation, which has shifted the overall market sentiment toward ADA tokens. Cardano (ADA) Price Action and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA has finally turned bearish and is poised to continue its price decline in the coming days. This shift in sentiment follows the breakdown of a consolidation phase that ADA has been experiencing between the $0.69 and $0.75 levels for several weeks. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, there is a strong possibility that ADA could see a 5% price drop until it reaches the $0.625 level. Meanwhile, if the decline continues and a daily candle closes below the $0.622 level, there is a strong possibility that ADA’s price could plummet by 30% until it reaches the $0.425 level. As of now, ADA is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating a bearish trend and weak price action for the asset. Current Price Momentum Despite these fluctuations, ADA is currently trading near $0.66, having recorded a price decline of over 1% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, during the same period, the asset’s trading volume dropped by 30%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days. Key Liquidation Levels With this bearish price action and continuous decline, traders’ market sentiment remains unchanged as they continue to favor the bearish side.

The newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported that a branch of the Busan District Court’s Criminal Division sent the ringleader of the operation to jail for four and half years. The court found the trio guilty of fraud and violating the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes. South Korean Court: More Crypto Scammers Jailed The court heard that the ringleader was the CEO of an “investment” firm. This firm, said prosecutors, duped victims into thinking they would receive monthly payments worth 30% of their original stakes. The Busan District Court in Busan, South Korea. (Source: Busan District Court/Facebook) The presiding judge jailed two other officials (both unnamed for legal reasons). The judge jailed one for three and a half years, and the other for two years and six months. Prosecutors explained that the CEO and the other two officials “established an investment company in a building in Busan in June 2019.” The ring, the prosecution service explained, told would-be investors that they would “select and trade” holdings in around 1,000 “high-quality” altcoins on the investors’ behalf. @GooglePlay blocks 17 unregistered crypto apps in South Korea, targeting foreign exchanges like KuCoin and MEXC, as the FIU enforces strict compliance with local regulations. #CryptoRegulation #SouthKorea https://t.co/M9UoZ8w1dV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 26, 2025 The coins, the group said, were “hand-picked” projects based in countries “all over the world.” This method, they promised, would ensure that investors received monthly payments of 30% of their stakes. However, the investors were advised to keep their funds on the gang’s “platform,” rather than make withdrawals. Instead, the prosecution service continued, the group proceeded to embezzle a total of 610 million won.

The arrest comes amid reports of a rise in crypto-related fraud cases. Last year, prosecutors revealed details of cases involving fraudsters who targeted crypto scam victims by posing as regulators.

The March 30 hack was initially detected by blockchain security firms TenArmorAlert and Decurity , both of which posted warnings on X to alert users of the protocol. The protocol’s founder, known only as Xatarrer, described the hack as “the worst news a protocol could received [sic],” but suggested the team intends to try to keep the protocol going despite the setback. Source: SIR.trading on X “Clever attack” targeted contract vault Decurity described the hack as a “clever attack” that targeted a callback function used in the protocol’s “vulnerable contract Vault” which leverages Ethereum’s transient storage feature. According to Decurity, the attacker was able to replace the real Uniswap pool address used in this callback function with an address under the hacker’s control, allowing them to redirect the funds in the vault to their address. TenArmorAlert further explained that by repeatedly calling this callback function, the attacker was able to fully drain the protocol’s TVL. Source: Decurity SupLabsYi, from blockchain security firm Supremacy, went into more detail on the attack in an X post, stating it may demonstrate a security flaw in Ethereum’s transient storage. Transient storage was added to Ethereum with last year’s Dencun upgrade. The new feature allows for temporary storage of data leading to lower gas fees than regular storage. According to SupLabsYi, it’s still a “nascent feature,” and the attack may be one of the first to exploit its vulnerabilities. “This isn’t merely a threat aimed at a single instance of uniswapV3SwapCallback,” SupLabsYi said. TenArmorSecurity said the stolen funds have now been deposited into an address funded through the Ethereum privacy solution Railgun. Xatarrer has since reached out to Railgun for assistance. Related: DeFi hacks drop 40% in 2024, CeFi breaches surge to $694M — Hacken SIR.trading’s documentation shows that it was billed as “a new DeFi protocol for safer leverage.” The stated purpose of the protocol was to address some of the challenges of leveraged trading, “such as volatility decay and liquidation risks, making it safer for long-term investing.” While it aimed for safer leveraged trading, the protocol’s documentation did warn users that despite being audited, its smart contracts could still contain bugs that could lead to financial losses — highlighting the platform’s vaults as a particular area of vulnerability. “Undiscovered bugs or exploits in SIR’s smart contracts could lead to fund losses. These might stem from complex logic in vault mechanics or leverage calculations that audits failed to catch, exposing users to rare but critical failures,” the project’s documentation states.

The crypto market’s downturn is being driven by weak demand in spot markets and a clear shift toward derisking, with traders hesitant to take new positions.

It’s not just about luck—it’s about timing. While Pudgy Penguins rides the NFT wave and Snek slithers through Cardano with purpose, one name is changing the playbook for early gains and smart rewards— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token on the block. It’s a next-gen community-backed crypto revolution that’s making serious waves with its blazing-hot presale. Sitting in Stage 15 at just $0.0002, this is your chance to double up on tokens with the LAUNCH100 bonus code , ending March 30. With a jaw-dropping 2900% ROI potential at its projected moon price of $0.006 and a referral program that pays you to bring your crew, BTFD is hands down the most exciting pick among the top new meme coins to join today. BTFD Coin – Built Different, Backed by Bulls, and Bursting With Rewards Here’s a thought: What if you didn’t just invest in a coin but joined a movement—one built around community power, early adopter perks, and the best damn dip in crypto history? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin brings. With its 15th presale stage now live, over 72 billion tokens already sold, more than 11,600 holders, and $6.43 million raised, BTFD isn’t waiting for a bull run—it’s building one. Let’s break it down. Right now, you can still grab BTFD tokens at $0.0002. Use the promo code LAUNCH100 and you’ll get double the tokens. That’s a 100% bonus. Drop $2,000 right now? That nets you 10 million tokens, but with the bonus code, you’re walking away with 20 million BTFD coins. When it hits its listing price of $0.0006, that’s already $12,000. But here’s the kicker: analysts are eyeing a moon price of $0.006—meaning your $2,000 could turn into $120,000. No games. Just timing. And speaking of games, BTFD isn’t just about HODLing. The full version of its Play-to-Earn game launched on January 1, 2025. It’s live, it’s rewarding, and it’s fun. Run with the Bulls Squad, conquer levels, and earn crypto while you play. That’s the kind of utility most meme coins can only dream of. There’s also staking, which went live on December 2, 2024. Park your tokens and earn a wild 90% APY. It’s built for bulls who want to play long and smart. This meme coin presale isn’t gonna sit at the current price forever. With just one stage left before the launch price hits $0.0006, you’re looking at your last window to get in early. Make your move or miss the moonshot. Pudgy Penguins – The NFT Darling with Crypto Clout Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) made waves as one of the earliest NFT brands to break into mainstream retail. With physical toys in 10,000+ stores and an ETF filing that blends NFTs with crypto, PENGU’s become more than a meme—it’s a brand. Its massive community, slick branding, and NFT-fueled governance token give it staying power as one of the top new meme coins to join today. For crypto users looking for a mix of digital art and blockchain utility, Pudgy Penguins delivers. The project blends collectible hype with real-world reach, which is why it continues to stay relevant even when other NFTs fizzle out. But PENGU isn’t in presale, and those early gains? Gone. That’s where BTFD’s got the edge. Snek – Cardano’s Meme Coin with a Mission Over on the Cardano blockchain, Snek (SNEK) has carved a name for itself by leaning into grassroots hype and decentralized vibes. It’s a symbol of community strength, building trust through consistent delivery and meme-savvy culture. SNEK’s known for its low fees, green-chain alignment, and native liquidity. It’s caught fire within the Cardano ecosystem and built up a strong base of supporters. If you’re already rolling with ADA, SNEK probably popped up on your radar. It’s a meme coin with a pulse—but again, it’s already live. BTFD, meanwhile, is still in its high-reward entry phase, which puts it at the top of our top new meme coins to join today list. Time to Double Down – BTFD’s Referral Program and Bonus Code Explained So here’s the juicy part, the Bulls care about—the double token deal and monthly cash incentives. When you buy using code LAUNCH100, every BTFD coin you grab is instantly doubled. That means more to stake, more to play, more to hold. And if you’re out here pushing the BTFD movement? You get paid too. Connect your wallet at the BTFD site , grab your referral code, and start sharing it. Anyone who uses your code and buys $50+ gets 10% more tokens, and you—if you make it into the top 20—earn 10% of their raise amount in BTFD coins. This offer runs until March 30, 6 PM UTC, then resets on April 1. This isn’t your average crypto airdrop. This is a movement that rewards its community, fuels growth from within, and creates real value. So whether you’re a casual investor or someone with a whole Telegram squad, this program’s got serious potential. Final Words – You’re Either In or You’re Watching Others Win In a market where timing is everything, BTFD Coin gives you all the tools to win early. Between the 90% APY staking, live P2E game, 2900% ROI potential, and the killer referral program, it’s clearly not your average meme coin. Snek and Pudgy Penguins are cool. No doubt. But they’re established, and their high-reward entry window closed a while back. BTFD? It’s still wide open, and it’s closing fast. That’s why it leads our list of the top new meme coins to join today. If you want in before Stage 16 and that sweet 2x bonus vanishes, now’s the time. Don’t sleep on the next big moonshot. Join the BTFD Coin presale now. Lock in your 100% bonus before March 30. Stack. Stake. Game. Repeat.

ETH is now consolidating and remains at risk of more losses. Ethereum struggled to continue higher above the $2,000 resistance level. The price is trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,820 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $1,820 and $1,880 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $2,100 and started another decline, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $1,920 and $1,880 support levels. It tested the $1,765 zone. A low was formed at $1,767 and the price recently attempted a fresh upward move.

Ethereum price is now trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,820 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,820 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,880 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,033 swing high to the $1,767 low. The first major resistance is near the $1,920 level. A clear move above the $1,920 resistance might send the price toward the $2,000 resistance. An upside break above the $2,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,050 resistance zone or even $2,120 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,880 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,780 level. The first major support sits near the $1,765 zone. A clear move below the $1,765 support might push the price toward the $1,720 support.

Since launching on Mar. 20, the platform has generated $5.4 million in protocol fees, attracted 700,000 active wallets, and enabled 30.59 million swaps, according to data from Dune Analytics. Although Raydium ( RAY ) still held 74% of the market share as of Mar. 30, PumpSwap has rapidly gained traction, making up 8% of Solana’s ( SOL ) total DEX trading volume. PumpSwap was created by Pump.fun to make trading memecoins and providing liquidity easier. Previously, memecoins launched on Pump.fun migrated to Raydium after completing the bonding curve. PumpSwap removes this extra step by combining trading, liquidity, and token creation on a single platform, enabling quick and free migrations. Like Raydium v4 and Uniswap ( UNI ) v2, the platform uses a constant product automated market maker model and bases pricing on liquidity pools rather than order books. You might also like: MUBARAK hype fades as memecoin plunges 40% in a day, nearing launch price Pump.fun originally charged a six-SOL migration fee to Raydium, but PumpSwap replaced this with a 0.25% trading fee, of which 0.20% goes to liquidity providers and 0.05% to the protocol. This structure is expected to evolve once Creator Revenue Sharing is introduced. PumpSwap’s early adoption was recently boosted by an integration with MEXC, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. On Mar.25, MEXC announced that PumpSwap would be supported by its DEX+ aggregator. MEXC’s 34 million+ users in 170 countries can now easily access tokens on the platform through the MEXC app and website, making it the first aggregator to support direct trading of PumpSwap-listed tokens. This move will potentially help in drawing in more liquidity and traders to the platform. As the memecoin frenzy cools, Solana’s total DEX volume has dropped sharply, from $258 billion in January to just $50 billion in March, as per DefiLlama data .

Will SUI price falter?,https://crypto.news/151m-in-sui-to-be-unlocked-this-week-will-sui-price-falter/,"Sui is set for a major supply event, with 64.19 million SUI tokens worth approximately $148.29 million scheduled for release on April 1, sparking concerns about potential selling pressure and its impact on SUI price. According to data from Tokenimist, this unlock represents 2.03% of the Sui’s ( SUI ) circulating supply, which currently stands at 3.17 billion SUI. Nevertheless, only 31.7% of the entire 10 billion maximum supply has been unlocked, indicating that more emissions are expected in the future. There has also been substantial movement in Sui’s decentralized finance ecosystem. The monthly decentralized exchange trading volume reached $5 billion, and the stablecoin market capitalization has nearly doubled from $370 million in December to $628 million as of Mar. 31. Amidst the crypto market downturn, Sui’s total value locked has decreased, falling from a peak of $2.08 billion in January to $1.2 billion, as per DefiLlama data .

The next important resistance levels are $2.64 and $2.78 if the price rises above this level. The closest support level on the downside is $2.23. A decline to $2.00 might occur if selling pressure increases. SUI technical analysis. Credit: crypto.news Technical indicators indicate momentum that is neutral to slightly bearish. The Relative Strength Index, at 44.5, shows weak buying interest, while the MACD is still negative, suggesting ongoing sell pressure. However, the Stochastic RSI is getting close to the oversold area, indicating a possible short-term rebound. Following the impending token unlock, SUI may see brief volatility as traders react to the increased supply. Consolidation and a retest of $2.37 may ensue if buyers protect the $2.23 support. A break below this mark, though, could result in additional declines toward $2.00. However, positive ecosystem developments like Canary Capital’s SUI-linked exchange traded fund filing and the blockchain recently surpassing 100 million total accounts, may boost sentiment. SUI may surge past $2.37 and test $2.64 in the upcoming weeks if buying interest outweighs selling pressure.

Even though volume is down 6%, it’s holding up better than Bitcoin, where trading volume has dropped by 37%. Recently, XRP dropped to a key support zone between $1.95 and $2.10. This level has been important in the past, and it’s holding well so far. Crypto analyst Josh from Crypto World shared an update on XRP’s price action. According to him, XRP is showing a slight bullish bounce. This comes after an oversold signal in the RSI (Relative Strength Index), suggesting that XRP was due for a short-term relief rally. This bounce or sideways movement is expected to last for the next day or two. Josh explains that an oversold signal isn’t a bottom signal—it just means the price needs some kind of reset in the short term. This oversold condition coincided with XRP’s price getting very close to major support, which is why the price has seen this slight bounce. The next key support level to watch is between $1.50 and $1.25, and XRP bounced from just about $1.26, just one cent away from that area. If the short-term bounce continues, resistance is expected around the previous support zone, now acting as resistance, between $2.24 and $2.30. If XRP manages to break above $2.30, the next resistance levels are around $2.48 and $2.56. SEC Closed Door Meeting (April 3): The SEC has scheduled a private meeting to talk about legal actions, administrative proceedings, and enforcement issues. According to reports, this meeting could help clarify XRP’s regulatory situation, especially regarding the approval of XRP-spot ETFs.

California’s Assembly Bill 1052 was introduced as the Money Transmission Act on Feb. 20, 2025, but was amended by Democrat and Banking and Finance Committee chair Avelino Valencia on March 28 to include several Bitcoin ( BTC ) and crypto-related investor protections. The amendments cross out “Money Transmission Act,” with the legislation now called “Digital assets.” “California often sets the national blueprint for policy, and if Bitcoin Rights passes here, it can pass anywhere,” Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter said in a March 30 statement. “Once passed, this legislation will guarantee nearly 40 million Californians the right to self-custody their digital assets without fear of discrimination.” Source: Satoshi Action Fund The bill would also deem the use of a digital financial asset as a valid and legal form of payment in private transactions and would prohibit public entities from restricting or taxing digital assets solely based on their use as payment. The bill would also expand the scope of California’s Political Reform Act of 1974 to prohibit a public official from issuing, sponsoring or promoting a digital asset, security or commodity. “A public official shall not engage in any transaction or conduct related to a digital asset that creates a conflict of interest with their public duties,” one section of the AB 1052 states. AB 1052 is now in the “desk process” — meaning the bill has been formally introduced and is awaiting its first reading. A total of 99 merchants currently accept Bitcoin payments in California, BTC Maps data shows. Ripple Labs, Solana Labs and Kraken are among the largest crypto firms based in California. Related: New BITCOIN Act would allow US reserve to exceed 1M A stablecoin-related bill was also introduced in California on Feb. 2, 2025, which aims to provide more clarity over stablecoin collateral requirements, liquidation processes, redemption and settlement mechanisms requirements and security audits. Bitcoin-related bills and measures near 100 at the US state level According to Bitcoin Law, 95 Bitcoin-related bills or measures have been introduced at the state level in 35 states, including 36 Bitcoin reserve bills that are still live. The Texas Senate passed a Bitcoin strategic reserve bil l in a 25-5 vote on March 6, while Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed a Bitcoin Rights bill into law on March 24. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile, both of which will initially use cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases.

The trio ran a deceptive operation from Busan under the guise of an investment firm, luring people with false promises of high monthly returns. The ringleader, identified as the company’s CEO, received a four-and-a-half-year jail term. Two other members, whose names remain undisclosed for legal reasons, were sentenced to three and a half years and two years and six months, respectively. The verdict was delivered by a branch of the Busan District Court’s Criminal Division, which found all three guilty of fraud and breaching the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes. Fake firm promised 30% returns According to prosecutors, the fraudulent investment company was set up in June 2019 in a Busan office building. Victims were persuaded to invest in “hand-picked” crypto projects that the scammers claimed were carefully selected from across the globe. The gang promised consistent returns of 30% per month on initial stakes—an unusually high figure that played a key role in convincing investors. Victims were instructed to keep their funds within the group’s “platform” and discouraged from withdrawing. This method helped the scammers maintain control over the invested funds while continuing to recruit new investors using similar tactics. The court ruled that the operation was designed to take advantage of individuals who had limited or no knowledge of crypto investments. The presiding judge noted that the defendants “committed crimes by taking advantage of the victims’ lack of knowledge about crypto investment,” describing the scheme as “deplorable.” Embezzlement mirrors wider trends The Busan-based scam is one of several recent high-profile fraud cases in South Korea involving the misuse of crypto platforms. Prosecutors highlighted that the group’s approach—promising guaranteed returns and discouraging withdrawals—reflected broader patterns used by other fraudulent operators across the country. Earlier this month, South Korean prosecutors arrested a major crypto market maker on separate scam coin-related charges. Though unrelated to the Busan case, the arrest is part of a growing crackdown on illicit crypto activities by law enforcement agencies. There is growing concern that many of these schemes specifically target individuals unfamiliar with cryptocurrency markets. Prosecutors in recent cases have consistently pointed to a lack of investor education as a key factor that scammers exploit. Victims targeted twice In a disturbing trend, victims of crypto scams are being further exploited by criminals posing as regulatory officials. In one previously reported case, a group of fraudsters contacted individuals who had already been defrauded, pretending to be investigators or legal officers. These impostors allegedly demanded payments of 5,000 USDT (Tether) as “investigation fees” to recover their lost funds. This tactic allowed scammers to extract even more money from people already suffering losses, further complicating the legal and emotional aftermath for victims. Prosecutors have not linked this secondary scam to the Busan case, but its emergence underscores the evolving tactics being used in South Korea’s crypto fraud landscape. Crackdown on crypto fraud grows The sentencing of the three Busan-based scammers adds to a growing list of prosecutions as South Korean authorities strengthen their enforcement of economic crime laws related to cryptocurrency. With an increase in investor participation in digital assets, the legal system is responding with stricter penalties and wider investigations. The Busan court’s ruling highlights the importance of regulation and investor education in deterring financial crimes in the crypto market. Although crypto remains a legitimate and fast-growing industry in South Korea, fraudulent schemes like this threaten investor trust and market stability. Authorities continue to warn the public to remain cautious of investment opportunities that promise abnormally high returns or discourage transparency.

Considering the comparison between BTC and US equity indices like Nasdaq and S&P 500, they appear to be forming a Death Cross in the coming weeks, hinting at a potential bearish momentum ahead. Analysts are curious as to whether BTC will finally crash under $80K, before resuing any upside move ahead. What Happens to Bitcoin Price Next, Along With S&P 500, and Nasdaq? Over the past several years, Bitcoin performance has been closely linked to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices. During the last three trading sessions from Wednesday to Friday, the S&P 500 has eroded a massive $2 trillion of investors’ wealth. The sell-off didn’t stop there—after the markets closed on Friday, S&P 500 futures plunged further, erasing an additional $120 billion within minutes, as per The Kobeissi Letter. Source: The Kobeissi Letter Despite a brief relief rally in mid-March, the rally was undone as soon as Trump imposed 25% auto tariffs. Bitcoin price also faced a similar scenario after attempting a rally past $90,000, however, it faced strong rejection at $89,000. Trump tariffs on Russia further threaten pushing Bitcoin under $80,000. As per Barchart data, BTC, along with S&P 500 and Nasdaq, is forming a death cross pattern. Analysts are speculating on the market behavior leading up to this technical event, questioning whether price declines ahead of these Death Crosses might mark a market bottom. Historical patterns have occasionally shown such setups, with the actual cross aligning with the end of a downward trend. Thus, we can see some major volatility this week ahead. Source: Barchart Popular economist Peter Schiff took this moment to criticize Bitcoin’s status as Digital Gold adding: “Gold is trading in new record territory again this evening. Gold is above $3,090 for the first time, with a new record high so far tonight of $3,097. In contrast, risk assets like stocks and Bitcoin are selling off again. If you still think Bitcoin is digital gold, think again”. Is BTC Following Global M2 Money Supply? While there’s been a strong ongoing narrative that Bitcoin price will rally along with global M2 money supply, crypto analyst Ali Martinez says that investors should approach this with caution. Martinez countered this claim by pointing out a significant trend in global money supply. According to the analyst, the global money supply has actually dropped by nearly $1 trillion over the past two weeks. Thus, he casts doubt on the expectations of a liquidity-driven bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Additionally, analyst Ali Martinez also reported a significant sell-off by Bitcoin miners over the past week. According to Martinez, miners offloaded more than 2,400 BTC during this period, amounting to approximately $220 million.

Speaking at an America PAC town hall in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Musk dismissed rumors linking Dogecoin to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative he is leading. “There are no plans for the government to use Dogecoin or anything, as far as I know,” Musk stated. Initially, Musk intended to name the initiative the Government Efficiency Commission but opted for the Department of Government Efficiency after public feedback. “I was going to call it the Government Efficiency Commission, but that’s a super boring name,” he remarked. Streamlining Government Operations The DOGE initiative, established by President Trump, aims to improve government efficiency by 15%. Musk emphasized the program’s focus on cost-cutting rather than cryptocurrency adoption. Despite its coincidental acronym, the project has no ties to Dogecoin, a meme cryptocurrency Musk has frequently supported. His enthusiasm for Dogecoin has led to confusion regarding his role in the government’s efficiency efforts. Musk’s Planned Departure Musk confirmed he would step down from his role in the Trump administration after achieving a $1 trillion reduction in the federal deficit. He estimates this goal could be accomplished within 130 days, potentially ending his tenure by May. Under Musk’s leadership, DOGE has aggressively reduced spending, including cutting excessive federal credit card distribution. He called the discovery of 4.6 million government-issued cards “absurd” and pushed for immediate action. While some praise Musk’s reforms, critics argue the initiative wields too much power without proper oversight.

As part of this effort, the company announced Monday it had issued 2b yen (about $13.3m) in zero-interest ordinary bonds . These proceeds, it said, will be used exclusively to purchase additional Bitcoin. The bond issuance, approved during a board meeting on March 31, supports Metaplanet’s broader push to position Bitcoin as a central pillar in its corporate treasury. *Metaplanet Issues 2 Billion JPY in 0% Ordinary Bonds to Purchase Additional $BTC * pic.twitter.com/ZrC5plI1Nc — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) March 31, 2025 Metaplanet Taps Stock Proceeds to Cover Bonds Notably, all bonds will be allocated to EVO FUND and carry no interest, with full redemption scheduled for Sept. 30, 2025. However, early redemption is permitted under specific conditions, giving the bondholder some flexibility. To fund redemption, Metaplanet plans to use proceeds generated through exercising its existing stock acquisition rights, a mechanism detailed in its Jan. 2025 filings. The company says the financial impact on its 2025 earnings will be limited—but the strategic implications are far more telling. Eric Trump Joins Metaplanet’s Advisory Board Meanwhile, Metaplanet has been steadily transforming into a Bitcoin-aligned company, taking cues from US-based MicroStrategy. It began acquiring BTC in April 2024 and currently holds 3,200 Bitcoin —worth about $260.8m. Looking ahead, it has set an even more ambitious public goal to build a 10,000 BTC reserve before end 2025. The company sees Bitcoin as a hedge against Japan’s prolonged economic headwinds, including currency volatility and mounting national debt. Anchoring its balance sheet in BTC, Metaplanet is betting on long-term strength in decentralized assets rather than fiat stability. Earlier this month, Metaplanet added firepower to its advisory team by appointing Eric Trump , a known crypto advocate, as the first member of its newly formed Strategic Board of Advisors. Trump’s inclusion, the company said, would accelerate its mission of driving Bitcoin adoption.

DOGE is declining and might test the $0.150 support zone. DOGE price started a fresh decline below the $0.1850 and $0.1750 levels. The price is trading below the $0.1750 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.170 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could extend losses if it breaks the $0.1620 support zone. Dogecoin Price Dips Further Dogecoin price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear $0.200, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE dipped below the $0.1880 and $0.1820 support levels. The bears were able to push the price below the $0.1750 support level. It even traded close to the $0.1620 support. A low was formed at $0.1628 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2057 swing high to the $0.1628 low. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.1750 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.170 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.170 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.1730 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1770 level. A close above the $0.1770 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1850 resistance. The 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2057 swing high to the $0.1628 low is also near the $0.1850 zone. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1880 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1950. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1770 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1635 level. The next major support is near the $0.1620 level. The main support sits at $0.1550. If there is a downside break below the $0.1550 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1320 level or even $0.120 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level.

Popcat just exploded back onto the TikTok scene, and PEPE’s massive 420.69 trillion supply is making headlines across Ethereum communities. Whether it’s the viral “O-face” cat memes or nostalgic frog energy from the 2000s, this week has been wild for meme coins—and the momentum hasn’t slowed down. But there’s one name quietly racking up millions that might just overshadow them all. Over the last few years, meme coins have proven time and again they’re more than a joke. From Gen Z TikTok trends to serious investor plays, they’ve transformed into cultural phenomena with the power to make portfolios pop. And now? BTFD Coin is on deck with one of the strongest cases for breakout success this year. With a Play-to-Earn game already live, 90% APY staking, and a vibrant community called the Bulls Squad, it’s not just another meme coin—it’s the meme coin moment. The best part? Its referral program is minting new winners every day. BTFD Coin’s Referral Program Is Paying Bulls in a Big Way Can a meme coin really offer $180,000 returns on a $6,000 buy-in? When it’s BTFD Coin, that’s not clickbait—it’s math. At just $0.0002 right now in Stage 15 of its meme coin presale , a $6,000 investment nabs you 30 million BTFD tokens. Once the listing price hits $0.0006, that’s $18,000. But if BTFD hits its predicted moon price of $0.006, that’s $180,000—and that’s without even using the LAUNCH100 code that doubles your tokens. BTFD Coin has already raised over $6.44 million, with more than 72 billion coins sold and 11,600+ Bulls riding the hype. As one of the top new meme coins to invest in March 2025 , this isn’t some slow-crawl presale—it’s barreling toward its 16th and final stage, and today’s the last day to use the LAUNCH100 bonus code. Use it, and your $6,000 buy becomes 60 million tokens, pushing your potential moonbag to $360,000. The referral program only adds more juice. Among the top new meme coins to invest in March 2025, BTFD also rewards its top 20 referrers with 10% of the total BTFD purchased through their code, dished out at the end of the month. Friends who use your code also get 10% more tokens on top of their buy. It’s a win-win—and a huge flex. How to buy? Simple. Start with a bullish wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Load it with ETH, BNB, or USDT. Head to the BTFD buy page , connect your wallet, enter the LAUNCH100 bonus code (in ALL CAPS), choose your purchase amount, and confirm. Stake your tokens and watch rewards stack while the rest of the market sleeps on what could be the top new meme coins to invest in March 2025. But what really sets BTFD apart is its community-first P2E game that launched on January 1, 2025. Players earn $BTFD just for playing and dominating leaderboards. This isn’t some future promise—it’s live, it’s rewarding, and it’s adding fuel to a fire that was already hot. Popcat’s Meme Resurgence Fueled by TikTok Hype Popcat (POPCAT) is clawing back into the spotlight in the most 2025 way possible: viral TikTok soundtracks and filters. Born from a meme that took the internet by storm back in 2020, this cat-faced coin has roared back into relevance thanks to TikTok creators using Popcat’s iconic open-mouthed face for reaction videos, remix edits, and gaming overlays. Unlike most meme coins trying to force a narrative, Popcat has always leaned into absurdity, and it’s working. There’s zero utility, no roadmap, no fluff—and that’s exactly why it resonates. Traders, influencers, and online communities are embracing POPCAT as the “chaotic neutral” of meme crypto. It’s fun, it’s weird, and it thrives in the space where viral trends meet speculative mania. POPCAT is riding high on exchange volume spikes and trending hashtags. Meme coins with strong cultural hooks have a habit of exploding, and Popcat is very much riding the wave that carried early Shiba Inu and Dogecoin enthusiasts to meme coin fame. PEPE Still Going Strong With a Supply That Turns Heads PEPE is sticking to its roots while commanding serious attention. With 420.69 trillion tokens minted on Ethereum and a no-tax, no-utility policy, this coin is leaning fully into the meme ethos—simplicity, speed, and supply dominance. And oddly enough? That’s exactly what keeps the community growing. The current buzz comes from a new wave of transparent whale purchases and renewed interest in hyper-supply tokens that are easy to acquire in bulk. As other tokens struggle to define use cases, PEPE wears its no-utility badge proudly, and the market is rewarding it for that clarity. Traders looking to scoop up trillions of tokens for cheap love its simplicity. PEPE’s Ethereum roots, community-driven growth, and legacy meme status make it a coin to watch—especially as new investors try to ride the next cultural shift in crypto. It’s fast becoming one of the most recognized names in the meme coin class of 2023–2025. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Popcat, and PEPE are three of the top new meme coins to invest in March 2025, each offering a different flavor of meme coin mania. Popcat has the viral power, PEPE brings the supply shock nostalgia, and BTFD? It brings everything—a live P2E game, 90% APY staking, and a referral system that literally pays you to spread the word. But let’s be real—only one of these is still in presale, sitting at just $0.0002, with 2900% ROI potential to a moon price of $0.006. The referral program and 100% bonus code both end tonight, and this is likely the last time to stack that kind of upside at this price. No more stalling. Join the BTFD Coin presale now , use the LAUNCH100 code, and either grow your stack or regret not owning the dip when it mattered. FAQs What is the current price of BTFD Coin and how high can it go? BTFD Coin is currently priced at $0.0002 in Stage 15 of its meme coin presale, with analysts projecting a moon price of $0.006—offering up to 2900% ROI potential. How does the BTFD referral program work? If your code makes it into the top 20 leaderboard, you receive 10% of every BTFD purchase made using it. Your referrals also get 10% more tokens. Is it still possible to use the LAUNCH100 code? Yes, but only until March 30, 2025—TONIGHT. The code doubles your BTFD tokens, making this the final chance to grab 2x rewards before it’s gone.

CoinFund's managing partner David Pakman recently projected that the global stablecoin supply could surge to $1 trillion by the end of 2025, driven by increasing onchain capital movement and rising adoption for everyday payments. At the same time, blockchain firm Sonic Labs has canceled plans to launch a US dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, opting instead to develop a UAE dirham-based alternative amid growing regulatory scrutiny and market concerns over algorithmic models. Stablecoin Supply Could Soar to $1 Trillion by End of 2025, Says CoinFund's David Pakman The global stablecoin market is poised for exponential growth, potentially reaching a staggering $1 trillion in supply by the end of 2025, according to David Pakman, managing partner at crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund. Pakman believes this surge could become one of the most significant catalysts for broader cryptocurrency adoption and decentralized finance (DeFi) expansion over the next year. “We’re in a stablecoin adoption upswell that’s likely to increase dramatically this year,” Pakman stated. “We could go from $225 billion stablecoins to $1 trillion just this calendar year.” While a trillion-dollar stablecoin market would still be modest compared to the multi-trillion-dollar traditional financial markets, Pakman underscored that such growth would mark a “meaningfully significant” shift in blockchain-based finance. He noted that the capital inflow would not only serve as a bridge between traditional and decentralized financial ecosystems but could also unlock deeper liquidity, utility, and yield opportunities within DeFi protocols. The stablecoin market has already shown signs of this rapid growth trajectory. Data from blockchain analytics platform Glassnode reveals that the aggregate supply of the five largest stablecoins recently hit an all-time high of over $208 billion as of March 28. That figure has continued climbing and surpassed $219 billion in recent weeks, reinforcing the narrative that stablecoins are driving fresh liquidity into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Pakman views this growing stablecoin supply as a structural tailwind that could catalyze broader crypto market expansion. Furthermore, the CoinFund executive noted that stablecoins could become even more influential if regulatory developments allow for additional yield-generating features. Specifically, he mentioned that if exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US or other major markets are permitted to offer staking rewards or yield-bearing mechanisms, it could fuel a wave of DeFi activity and mainstream adoption. “If we have a moment this year where ETFs are permitted to provide staking rewards or yield to holders, that unlocks really meaningful uplift in DeFi activity, broadly defined,” Pakman said. Beyond their role as a trading instrument and store of value, stablecoins are increasingly being used for everyday payments and remittance services — a trend that supports the case for long-term growth. Pakman pointed out that stablecoin transaction volumes have skyrocketed, increasing more than 22 times since 2021. More importantly, he highlighted a noticeable decrease in the average transaction size, indicating that stablecoins are being used more frequently for smaller, everyday payments rather than just large institutional transfers. This aligns with recent observations from CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, who has noted that stablecoins are evolving into an essential payment and remittance tool, particularly in emerging markets and regions where access to traditional banking is limited. However, Ju tempered expectations about the direct impact of stablecoin growth on Bitcoin’s price, cautioning that an expanding stablecoin supply alone may not be enough to fuel Bitcoin’s next major rally without additional catalysts. Market Mid-Cycle, Not Euphoric Peak Analysts at blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock have also weighed in on the growing stablecoin supply, suggesting that the market may still be in a “mid-cycle” phase rather than at the euphoric peak of a bull market. The steady increase in stablecoin liquidity is often viewed as a leading indicator of capital readiness for broader crypto market participation. Historically, when stablecoin reserves on exchanges rise, it signals that investors have cash on the sidelines, ready to flow into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto assets. With stablecoins now playing an integral role in payment processing, trading, lending, and cross-border transactions, the industry could be on the verge of a new era of digital finance — one in which blockchain-based money serves billions worldwide. Sonic Labs Cancels US Dollar-Pegged Algorithmic Stablecoin, Shifts Focus to UAE Dirham-Backed Model In related news, Sonic Labs, a leading blockchain development firm co-founded by renowned DeFi architect Andre Cronje , has abandoned its plans to launch a US dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, pivoting instead to a new project focused on a United Arab Emirates dirham-denominated alternative. The move comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny of algorithmic stablecoins and in the wake of lessons learned from past catastrophic failures in the crypto market. The unexpected reversal was announced by Cronje on March 28 via a post on social platform X, just one week after revealing the firm's ambitious plans to launch a USD-based algorithmic stablecoin offering yields of up to 23% annually. “We will no longer be releasing a USD-based algorithmic stablecoin,” Cronje wrote. “Completely unrelated, we will be releasing a mathematically bound numerical Dirham, which is settled and denominated in USD, which is definitely not a USD-based algorithmic stablecoin.” The change in strategy coincides with the UAE’s announcement that it will roll out its digital dirham central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the fourth quarter of 2025 — a development that may have influenced Sonic Labs’ shift toward a dirham-backed solution. Sonic Labs’ original plan to launch a USD-pegged algorithmic stablecoin was met with considerable skepticism within the crypto community. Many critics cited the collapse of TerraUSD (UST) — a dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin that infamously lost its peg in May 2022, wiping out over $40 billion in market value — as a cautionary tale. The failure of Terra’s algorithmic model triggered widespread regulatory backlash, significant investor losses, and a loss of public confidence in such mechanisms. Cronje himself has been candid about the emotional toll the Terra collapse had on him and other developers in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. In previous statements, he admitted to experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to algorithmic stablecoins . “Pretty sure our team cracked algo stable coins today, but previous cycle gave me so much PTSD not sure if we should implement,” Cronje said at the time. The memory of Terra’s downfall, which saw UST depeg from the US dollar and crash to as low as $0.30 while sister token LUNA plummeted from over $120 to under $1, remains fresh in the minds of investors and policymakers alike. The incident became a defining moment for crypto regulation, leading the European Union to explicitly prohibit algorithmic stablecoins under its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) bill to prevent similar collapses. Sonic Labs' pivot toward a UAE dirham-denominated stablecoin appears to align strategically with the broader digital transformation of the UAE’s financial system. Earlier this month, Khaled Mohamed Balama, governor of the Central Bank of the UAE, confirmed that the country plans to launch its blockchain-based digital dirham CBDC by the end of 2025. The digital dirham is expected to function alongside its physical counterpart and will be accepted across all payment channels. Balama emphasized that the introduction of the digital dirham could strengthen financial stability, improve cross-border payments, and aid in combating financial crimes through enhanced transparency and traceability. While Cronje stressed in his announcement that Sonic’s new project is “definitely not” an algorithmic stablecoin, the company's focus on a mathematically bound, dirham-based model suggests an attempt to create a compliant and regionally integrated digital asset that could benefit from the UAE’s progressive stance toward blockchain and financial innovation. The timing of Sonic Labs’ decision reflects a broader recalibration within the crypto industry regarding stablecoins. Recent market trends show that stablecoins are increasingly being used for small, everyday payments, as opposed to large speculative transfers. A Safer Approach to Onchain Payments? The decision to build a UAE dirham-denominated stablecoin, rather than a USD algorithmic model, may prove to be a prudent long-term strategy for Sonic Labs. By integrating their product with the financial ecosystem of a jurisdiction actively pursuing a regulated digital currency, the firm can potentially avoid the pitfalls and risks that doomed Terra and other algorithmic stablecoins. Whether Sonic Labs’ dirham-backed stablecoin will gain traction remains to be seen, but the project reflects an increasing trend toward stablecoin models that are either fully collateralized, centrally regulated, or closely tied to sovereign digital currencies — rather than relying on opaque algorithms and unsustainable yield incentives.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-31 05:30:00

Shiba Inu Price seems unlikely to recover soon, and a rival is emerging as an entirely new DeFi project with practical use cases.

SHIB recently saw its price fall by 2% over the last week to $0.00001253. According to Shiba Inu latest news, the dip was on the heels of investors moving funds around amid negative technical signals. Moving averages show a steady decline, and the relative strength index shows that SHIB is overbought. Chart patterns show no signs of a breakouts that can potentially push the price higher. The experts see SHIB continuing to hold its pace but with no promise of an upswing. Certain technical models forecast a dip by about 2.19% to $0.00001268 by April 29.

Its current DeFi coin price of $0.0734 is attractive, and most believe that it can go through the roof again once more financial institutions adopt its technology.

If you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in that combines high-risk, high-reward potential with growing market presence, Peanut the Squirrel could be your next big play. Ranked #194 with a market cap of $183.89 million, PNUT is making waves in the Solana blockchain ecosystem. While its recent 24-hour drop of 9.78% might raise some eyebrows, the long-term potential is undeniable. PNUT’s price has been volatile, with its most recent peak at $2.47 in November 2024.

With a price tag of just $0.000000064, OSAK is still far from its all-time high of $0.092303 reached in April 2023. However, the 85.39% drop from that high may signal that the coin is undervalued, making it an interesting entry point for investors looking to bet on its recovery. As a meme coin with substantial liquidity and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $63.52 million, Osaka Protocol presents a unique opportunity for those looking to enter the DeFi space with a meme coin twist. The circulating supply of 750.87 trillion OSAK tokens is massive, but with its focus on decentralized community collaboration, it continues to attract attention.

Busan District Court Criminal Division 6 convicted the defendants of breaching the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes. Busan crypto scammers deceived investors with false promises The three men ran an illicit crypto investment in a building in Busan in June 2019, deceiving investors by promising to “select and trade around 1,000 quality coins (virtual currencies) from around the world. They promised investors monthly returns equivalent to 30% of their initial investments. The investment scammers used a proprietary trading algorithm they claimed would yield profits by exploiting market fluctuations. There was no such algorithm, and the funds raised were diverted for personal spending. In total, they defrauded the investors of 610 million won. The court sentenced the ring leader to four and a half years in prison. The other two, who remain unnamed for legal reasons, received three and a half years, and the one for two years and six months. While delivering the verdict, the preceding judge said the defendants took advantage of the public’s interest in cryptocurrency investment opportunities to defraud and deceive innocent investors. According to the judge, that type of behavior erodes trust in the financial system and deserves harsh punishment. The case underscores South Korean authorities’ growing scrutiny of crypto-related crimes. The country has introduced stricter regulations and oversight to safeguard investors and uphold market integrity in the past few years. According to legal experts, the ruling sends a message to would-be criminals that fraud is a serious offense in the world of crypto. South Korea’s crypto boom sparks tighter fraud crackdown As per recent data submitted to Rep. Cha Gyu-geun of the Rebuilding Korea Party, South Korea’s cryptocurrency investors reached 16.29 million in February. This figure represents nearly 32% of the country’s population. The data, compiled from accounts at the country’s top five domestic virtual asset exchanges – Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax – shows consistent growth throughout 2024. The number of crypto investors first surpassed 14 million in March 2024. Following Donald Trump’s election as U.S. President in November, another 500,000 people entered the market, pushing the total beyond 15 million. In a recent report, 20% of South Korean public officials who submitted asset declarations reported owning cryptocurrency. Of 2,047 officials who filed declarations, 411 disclosed direct cryptocurrency holdings or investments. As virtual asset-related crime methods become more sophisticated, intelligent, and international, establishing an effective crime response system through close cooperation with relevant organizations has become necessary. Last month, the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office established a formal joint investigation unit that exclusively investigates crypto-related crimes and fraud cases. According to a report by Aju News, the department is named the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office-run Joint Investigation Unit or JIU for Virtual Asset Crimes. The unit will include 35 full-time employees with experience dealing with crypto crimes in South Korea, mainly prosecutors and financial regulators from the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service. It will be led by Chief Prosecutor Park and two deputy chief prosecutors. The body was originally formed as a temporary task force in 2023 to handle the spike in crypto-related fraud cases. However, as the number of cases has only increased significantly in South Korea in the past two years, alongside the rise of crypto adoption in the country, the District Prosecutors’ Office decided to transform the task force into a formal joint investigation department.

This happened as the Japanese stock market tanked 4% in early trading hours on Monday, as they prepare for President Trump’s “Liberation Day” on April 2. Metaplanet Issues 2 Billion JPY In Zero-Interest Bonds for Bitcoin Purchase Earlier today, Metaplanet announced the issuance of its 10th Series of Ordinary Bonds worth 2 Billion JPY to the EVO FUND. The officials stated that they would use these funds exclusively to fund Bitcoin purchases . The zero-interest bonds, each with a face value of ¥50 million, are scheduled for redemption on September 30, 2025. Simon Gerovich, Representative Director of Metaplanet, oversaw the bond issuance. In a message on the X platform, Gerovich wrote: “Buying the dip!” Apart from the Japanese firm, Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital has also announced a $2 billion stock sale to fund its Bitcoin purchases ahead. In less than a year of adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, the Japanese firm has already accumulated 3,350 BTC at an average purchase price of $83,000 per BTC. To execute its BTC purchase plan moving ahead, the firm has also tapped Eric Trump to join its board of advisers. Despite the current development, the stock price has come under severe selling pressure, dropping by 23% over the past week after a strong rally in early March. Trump Liberation Day Pushes Japanese Stock Market Down 4% As the global markets prepare for the Trump “Liberation Day” set to kick in on April 2nd, Japan’s stock market has dropped more than 4% in the early trading hours on Monday. Bitcoin price sees continued selling pressure, slipping under $81,500 as markets brace for greater macro uncertainty this week. This overall development has led to further selling pressure on the Metaplanet stock in recent days. Global market is bracing for major turbulence ahead as risk-ON assets face strong selling pressure as Trump’s reciprocal tariffs kick in. President Trump has declared Wednesday as “Liberation Day,” marking the start of a wave of new tariffs. The U.S. is set to impose 20%+ tariffs on imports from over 25 countries, targeting goods valued at more than $1.5 trillion by the end of April. Amid this massive uncertainty, the Gold price is eying a solid $3,100 levels. Policy Uncertainty Surges to Historic Highs The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index has soared to unprecedented levels, surpassing nearly every major crisis in modern U.S. history. Current uncertainty levels are approximately 80% higher than those recorded during the 2008 financial crisis.

Currently, only Tesla and Block hold Bitcoin among S&P 500 firms, but projections suggest over 120 more could follow. While the US sees increasing corporate and institutional Bitcoin adoption, Europe still lags behind due to regulatory complexity and conservative financial strategies. Meanwhile, institutional interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) is also limited, thanks to privacy concerns, regulatory uncertainty, and compliance risks. S&P 500 Companies May Turn to Bitcoin A growing belief is emerging among financial experts that a large portion of the S&P 500 could adopt Bitcoin as part of their corporate treasuries by the end of the decade. Elliot Chun, a partner at tech-focused advisory firm Architect Partners, predicted that by 2030, around 25% of S&P 500 companies will hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Chun believes this shift will be driven by increasing pressure on treasury managers, who may fear job security risks if they fail to capitalize on Bitcoin's potential upside. He suggested that managers will feel obliged to at least experiment with Bitcoin as they know that the risk of inaction could outweigh the risk of failure. Currently, only two S&P 500-listed firms, Tesla and Block, hold Bitcoin. If Chun’s projection materializes, at least another 123 S&P 500 firms will need to follow suit. For now, 89 publicly traded firms globally hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, with Strategy (MSTR) leading the way as the largest corporate holder. GameStop may soon join the list after its recent $1.3 billion convertible notes offering, which is intended to fund Bitcoin purchases. Entities holding BTC (Source: Bitcoin Treasuries ) The enthusiasm around Bitcoin's long-term prospects is also fueled by well known tech investors and executives. People like ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, and Block CEO Jack Dorsey predicted that Bitcoin could climb to the $500,000 to $1,000,000 range by 2030. Historically, companies that incorporated Bitcoin into their treasuries have benefited. In fact, Strategy's stock surged by more than 2,000% since it first invested in Bitcoin in August of 2020. This far outpaced Bitcoin’s own 781% growth and the S&P 500’s 64.8% gain during the same period. However, Chun also warned that not every firm will be able to replicate Strategy’s success. He pointed out that the firm became a “one-of-one” by repositioning itself entirely around Bitcoin, and this move is unlikely to work for every company. Chun pointed out that when Strategy began accumulating Bitcoin, it was one of the few ways for US asset managers to gain some exposure to the cryptocurrency. That changed in January of 2024 when the SEC approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Despite the momentum, Chun argued that Bitcoin is still an ”unproven strategy” as a treasury asset, particularly for those seeking to hedge against inflation or diversify risk. Nevertheless, he believes in Bitcoin’s flexibility and advantages over traditional stores of value like gold. He explained that Bitcoin is a digital commodity recognized under GAAP accounting standards, with a fungible and highly liquid profile that is easier to store and transfer compared to gold. Europe Lags Behind in Bitcoin Adoption While Bitcoin adoption among US companies is expected to go up, institutional adoption of Bitcoin in the European Union remains slow. After President Donald Trump’s March 7 executive order to use Bitcoin seized in criminal cases to build a federal Bitcoin reserve, European firms have shown little movement in embracing the cryptocurrency. This hesitation is largely due to the complexity of Europe’s regulatory environment and a more conservative approach to new financial instruments. Elisenda Fabrega , general counsel at European RWA tokenization platform Brickken, noticed that corporate adoption in Europe is still limited due to structural barriers, including regulatory ambiguity, institutional caution, and market maturity. Unlike the US, where Bitcoin is being positioned as a national reserve asset, Europe still has to take a clear stance on the cryptocurrency's role in corporate treasuries or national finance strategies. Bitcoin’s economic model, which rewards early adopters, fueled the growing institutional interest in the US, especially after Trump’s executive order. However, European institutions largely refrained from disclosing large Bitcoin holdings or crypto service offerings. Only a few exceptions include BNP Paribas, 21Shares AG, VanEck Europe, Jacobi Asset Management, and Bitpanda. Even so, a recent Bitpanda survey suggests that European financial firms may be underestimating investor demand for crypto exposure by as much as 30%. (Source: Bitpanda ) Analysts at Bitfinex point to Europe’s fragmented regulatory framework as a key reason behind the slow institutional adoption. Conservative investment mandates and regulatory hurdles have made it quite difficult for European pension funds and large asset managers to confidently allocate to Bitcoin. Retail investor demand in Europe is also generally weaker compared to the US, which has benefited from a more unified capital market and clearer regulatory guidance, particularly after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Despite the current sluggishness, some signs of potential change emerged. On March 25, BlackRock launched a Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe, which could help build institutional confidence and encourage more corporate adoption of Bitcoin across the European market. DeFi Growth Stalled While Bitcoin adoption is picking up some steam, institutional adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) still faces many obstacles. This is largely due to concerns around privacy, regulatory uncertainty, and legal accountability. Shibtoshi , the founder of the privacy-focused DeFi platform SilentSwap, pointed out that the inherent transparency of on-chain transactions poses a major challenge for businesses that need to protect sensitive information like trading strategies, payroll data, and corporate agreements. He explained that while the concerns around compliance, privacy, and user experience are valid, they are also solvable. Advances in privacy-preserving protocols like SilentSwap, which aim to offer enterprise-grade privacy solutions, are helping make DeFi more appealing to corporate users. A key issue slowing institutional participation in DeFi is the lack of regulatory clarity, particularly regarding whether DeFi tokens qualify as securities and who bears legal responsibility when decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) make mistakes. Shibtoshi also believes that there is a need for sensible regulation that encourages innovation without sacrificing the core benefits of DeFi, including self-custody, speed, and low-cost transactions. In the United States, lawmakers recently took a step toward reducing regulatory burdens on DeFi by repealing the controversial IRS broker rule. This rule would have required decentralized platforms to report customer transactions. It was overturned by a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives in early March. However, there are still some concerns that continued overregulation could ultimately stifle the DeFi sector. Crypto entrepreneur Artem Tolkachev argued that the push for stringent regulatory compliance risks undermining the very principles of decentralization that define DeFi. He warned that excessive regulation could increase the potential for censorship and shift control away from users toward intermediaries and large institutions.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-31 05:54:16

As reported by Chosun Ilbo, Busan District Court’s Criminal Division 6, led by Presiding Judge Kim Yong-gyun, announced the verdict on March 30. The court sentenced the group’s leader, Mr. A, who served as the CEO of an investment company, to 4.5 years in prison. Two other members of the gang received prison sentences of 3.5 years and 2.5 years, respectively. The defendants established an investment firm in Busan in June 2019, claiming they would select and trade around 1,000 high-quality virtual currencies from across the globe. They promised investors monthly returns of 30% on their original investments. However, instead of managing the funds as promised, the group embezzled the money for personal gain. The court criticized the defendants for exploiting the victims’ lack of knowledge about cryptocurrency investments. The judge stated, “Mr. A and others committed the crime by taking advantage of the victims’ lack of knowledge about coin investment,” adding that the method and circumstances of the crime were “very poor,” as they misled investors with false promises. This case shows the growing issue of crypto-related fraud in South Korea.

The Financial Services Agency (FSA) plans to submit a bill to parliament to revise the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act as early as next year after having considered the changes through internal study groups, Nikkei reported on March 30 without citing a source. The outlet reported that the details are still being finalized, but the change would see cryptocurrencies likely put under insider trading laws that currently apply to other financial products, such as stocks, which outlaw trades based on insider information. However, cryptocurrencies are likely to be put in a separate category from securities such as stocks and bonds. If the changes go through and crypto is regulated under the country’s finance laws , companies offering crypto would have to register with the FSA. Nikkei reported that the regulator plans to enforce the new rules regardless of whether a company operates in Japan, but it was unclear how the laws would be enforced against overseas entities. Also unclear was what cryptocurrencies would be regulated and how distinctions would be made between widely traded assets such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) compared to speculative and high-risk tokens such as memecoins. The FSA’s headquarters is in central Tokyo, just across the street from the Ministry of Finance. Source: Wikimedia The reported upcoming change comes amid a wave of pro-crypto moves made by Japan’s regulators and government. Related: USDC stablecoin receives approval for use in Japan, says Circle Earlier this month, the country issued its first license allowing a company to deal with stablecoins to SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of the local financial conglomerate SBI, which said it was preparing to support Circle’s USDC ( USDC ). The country’s ruling Liberal Democracy Party also moved ahead with reforms to slash the capital gains tax on crypto from 55% to 20% and categorize digital assets as a distinct asset class. In February, local reports said the FSA was looking to lift a ban on crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to align with the policy position of Hong Kong, which approved crypto ETFs for trading in April 2024.

Data submitted to representative Cha Gyu-geun of the minor opposition Rebuilding Korea Party found over 16 million people had crypto exchange accounts out of a total population of 51.7 million, according to a March 30 report from local news agency Yonhap. This would be equivalent to over 30% of the population. All the data was taken from the top five domestic virtual exchanges in South Korea: Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit and Gopax. Individuals with multiple accounts were only counted once. Industry officials are reportedly speculating the number of crypto users could hit 20 million by the end of the year, with one unnamed official being cited by Yonhap saying: “Some believe the crypto market has reached a saturation point, but there is still an endless possibility for growth compared with the matured stock market.” Following Trump’s election win last November, the number of crypto users spiked by over 600,000 to 15.6 million , collectively holding 102.6 trillion South Korean won ($70.3 billion) in crypto assets.

This all-stock transaction, unveiled on Friday via a post on X itself, signals a significant consolidation of Musk’s empire and a powerful push towards integrated AI development. For those tracking the intersection of crypto and tech, this acquisition underscores the growing influence of AI and its potential to reshape social media and beyond. The Groundbreaking xAI Acquisition of Social Media Platform X: A Deep Dive “xAI has acquired X in an all-stock transaction,” Musk declared, setting the stage for a unified future. This isn’t just a simple merger; it’s a strategic alignment of two powerful entities under Musk’s vision. Let’s break down the key details of this landmark acquisition : All-Stock Deal: The transaction is entirely in stock, meaning no cash was exchanged directly. This suggests a long-term commitment and confidence in the combined entity’s future growth. Valuation Revelation: Musk disclosed the valuations of both companies, pegging xAI at a hefty $80 billion and X at $33 billion (after accounting for $12 billion in debt against a $45 billion enterprise value). This provides a fresh benchmark for the perceived worth of both ventures in the current market. Synergistic Future: Musk emphasized the “intertwined” futures of xAI and X, highlighting the strategic rationale behind the acquisition . He explicitly mentioned combining “data, models, compute, distribution, and talent,” indicating a deep integration across all operational layers. For those in the crypto space, where community and information dissemination are paramount, the implications of this acquisition are considerable. X, a vital social media platform for crypto discussions and news, is now intrinsically linked with a leading AI developer. This could lead to novel integrations of AI within the X platform, potentially impacting how information is shared, consumed, and even verified within the crypto community. Why Now? Decoding Musk’s Strategic Play The timing and rationale behind this acquisition are crucial to understanding Musk’s grand plan. Here are some key factors driving this decision: Data and Model Powerhouse: X’s vast trove of user-generated content is a goldmine for training advanced AI models. By bringing X under the xAI umbrella, Musk secures direct and unfettered access to this invaluable data resource, giving xAI a significant edge over competitors like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. Distribution Advantage: X provides xAI with an unparalleled distribution channel to deploy its AI products, like the Grok chatbot, directly to a massive user base. Imagine AI-powered features seamlessly integrated into your X experience – this acquisition makes that a tangible reality. Financial Efficiency: As reported by the Wall Street Journal, combining the entities is expected to streamline fundraising efforts. A unified xAI Holdings Corp. is likely to be a more attractive proposition for investors seeking exposure to both AI and a major social media platform . Competitive Edge in the AI Race: Musk is clearly positioning xAI to be a frontrunner in the fiercely competitive AI landscape. This acquisition is a bold move to consolidate resources and accelerate xAI’s progress in developing cutting-edge AI technologies. Valuation Volatility: X’s Rollercoaster Ride The valuation of X has been a subject of intense scrutiny and fluctuation since Musk’s initial purchase in 2022. Let’s trace the valuation journey: Timeline Event Valuation (USD Billion) October 2022 Musk Acquires Twitter $44 Post-Acquisition (Various Estimates) Fidelity Estimate Less than $10 Recent Months Rise in Valuation Increased (Driven by perceived influence) xAI Acquisition Musk’s Declared Valuation $33 (Net of Debt) / $45 (Enterprise Value) xAI Valuation Standalone Valuation $80 This valuation rollercoaster highlights the dynamic nature of tech company valuations, especially in the rapidly evolving social media platform and AI sectors. Musk’s initial purchase price of $44 billion now appears significantly higher than the current assessed value of X within this acquisition deal. However, the strategic value of X to xAI, particularly for data and distribution, is undeniable. xAI’s Ascent in the AI Arena: Challenging OpenAI and Beyond Founded in 2023, xAI has rapidly emerged as a serious contender in the AI race. Musk has aggressively recruited top AI talent and invested heavily in infrastructure. Key milestones in xAI’s journey include: Talent Acquisition: xAI has poached leading AI researchers from Google DeepMind, Microsoft, and OpenAI, assembling a formidable team. Infrastructure Build-out: Massive AI data centers have been constructed to support the training and deployment of advanced AI models. Fundraising Success: xAI has secured substantial funding, including a $6 billion round in December, and its valuation has soared to $80 billion, reflecting investor confidence in its potential. Grok AI Model: The development of Grok 3, a frontier AI model, demonstrates xAI’s technological prowess, rivaling industry leaders in key performance benchmarks. Musk’s simultaneous efforts to challenge OpenAI, both through lawsuits and a takeover bid, underscore his ambition to reshape the AI landscape. The acquisition of X provides xAI with a unique strategic advantage in this ongoing competition. The Road Ahead: Integration and Implications With the acquisition finalized, the focus now shifts to the integration of xAI and X. While Grok has already been integrated into X Premium, deeper integrations are expected, potentially transforming the user experience and unlocking new AI-powered functionalities. However, Musk’s history of blurring lines between his companies also raises potential regulatory and ethical questions, which will need to be carefully navigated. Ultimately, the acquisition of X by xAI is a bold and transformative move by Elon Musk. It signifies a profound commitment to integrating AI into the fabric of social media and leveraging X as a powerful engine for xAI’s growth and innovation. For the crypto and tech communities, this development warrants close attention, as it could reshape the future of online interaction and information dissemination in the age of AI.

Besides, Four (FORM) & Zcash (ZEC) display some strength but hold marginal gains between 5% and 9%. Why is the Crypto Market Down Today? The ETFs are recording consecutive outflows, which suggests the bearish sentiments of the investors. Meanwhile, the major reason for the pullback is said to be the uncertainty ahead of the new tariffs by the United States, which are set to begin on 02 April 2025. With this, experts believe a potential increase in the inflation rates that could negatively impact the market. Along with this, the EU CPI & unemployment rates and the US unemployment, non-farm payrolls, and Fed Chair Powell’s speech are scheduled for this week, which may keep up the volatility within the markets.

The Bitcoin price has dropped but does carry a strong scope of a bullish rebound. As per some reports, the long-term holders have again begun to accumulate BTC along with the whales. This sheds light on the bullish possibilities, but the external tariffs and inflation rattled the markets. The historical strong Q1 patterns were not met, stirring investors’ doubts. However, experts believe Bitcoin could hedge against chaos if conditions settle. The technicals have turned bearish at the moment, suggesting potential market corrections. Hence, after the bearish quarterly close, one can expect some relief with the beginning of the fresh quarterly trade. Meanwhile, the sluggish behavior of the bulls may hinder the progress of the rally and compel the markets to remain under bearish pressure.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BTC|ETH|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-31 06:14:40

TenArmor flagged several suspicious transactions and pointed out that the stolen funds had been transferred to RailGun, a privacy platform that helps hide transactions. Later, security platform Decurity, revealed that the hacker took advantage of a flaw in SIR.trading’s Vault contract, specifically in a function called “uniswapV3SwapCallback.” Decurity referred to the hack as a “clever attack.” Synthetics Implemented Right @leveragesir has been hacked for $355k This is a clever attack.

The anonymous creator of SIR.trading, Xatarrer, acknowledged the attack after it happened, calling it “the worst news a protocol could receive.” They asked for community feedback on what to do next and expressed interest in rebuilding despite the loss. Since this attack may be among the first instances of hackers exploiting this new Ethereum feature in the real world, it raises questions regarding the security of transient storage. Security experts caution that unless developers build stronger safeguards into their smart contracts, similar attacks may occur.

Interestingly, XRP is among the biggest losers even though the company behind the token got some big and positive news this month. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView The middle of the graph above demonstrates a big but brief shot up to $2.6 on March 19 when Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse effectively announced the end of the lawsuit between his company and the US SEC. This was the moment the XRP army waited for over four years. However, it turned out to be a classic ‘sell-the-news’ event as the asset’s price nosedived shortly after and has failed to recapture the momentum. Even last week’s confirmation of the lawsuit closure failed to impact XRP positively. Just the opposite; the third-largest cryptocurrency has plunged below $2.1. It has lost roughly 20% of its value since the March 19 peak and is close to breaking below $2, which could spell further trouble even though everything seems to be going in Ripple’s way . The market-wide correction, which has pushed BTC to $82,000, ETH to $1,800, and SOL to $125, could be blamed for XRP’s decline. However, Ripple’s cross-border token has taken this retracement the worst from the top 20 alts, having lost 14.5% on a weekly scale, while BTC is down by 5.5%, SOL by 9%, and ETH by 11.6%. Aside from the aforementioned ‘sell-the-news’ moment , another possible reason behind XRP’s particularly painful decline could be linked to the recent activities of whales. These large market participants went on an accumulation spree after the US elections and during XRP’s surge from $0.6 to $3.4 , which happened within months. Now, though, they have switched tactics by disposing of large amounts of XRP, which could trigger even a more violent price crash.

Keeping up with the flood of new AI models can feel like trying to drink from a firehose. From tech giants like Google and OpenAI to nimble startups, everyone is racing to release the next groundbreaking AI. Industry benchmarks and technical jargon often obscure what these models actually *do* for everyday users and businesses. Forget the confusion – Bitcoin World is here to give you the inside scoop on the most advanced AI models launched since 2024. We’ll break down what each model is good for and, crucially, how you can actually use them. Consider this your continuously updated guide to navigating the AI revolution. While there are millions of AI models out there (Hugging Face alone hosts over 1.4 million!), we’ve handpicked the standouts to save you time and keep you ahead of the curve. Latest AI Models Released in 2025: A Deep Dive 2025 has already been a banner year for AI innovation. Let’s explore some of the most talked-about models: Google Gemini 2.5: Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is positioned as a powerhouse for reasoning, particularly for building web applications and sophisticated code agents. While Google touts its capabilities, it’s worth noting that early benchmarks show it underperforming Claude Sonnet 3.7 on certain coding tasks. To access Gemini 2.5, you’ll need a Gemini Advanced subscription, which comes in at $20 per month. ChatGPT-4o Image Generator: OpenAI has boosted its popular GPT-4o model with image generation capabilities, expanding beyond just text. This upgrade quickly went viral, especially for its ability to transform images into anime in the style of Studio Ghibli. However, copyright implications of this feature are something to consider. Access to GPT-4o, including image generation, requires at least a $20 per month ChatGPT Plus subscription. Stability AI’s Stable Virtual Camera: Stability AI, known for image generation, has launched Stable Virtual Camera. This innovative model can generate 3D scenes and camera angles from a single 2D image. While impressive, it currently has limitations with complex scenes involving humans or dynamic elements like moving water. For non-commercial research, it’s available on HuggingFace. Cohere’s Aya Vision: Cohere’s Aya Vision is a multimodal model claiming top-tier performance in image captioning and answering questions about photos. A key differentiator is its strength in languages beyond English, a feature Cohere emphasizes sets it apart. You can try Aya Vision for free via WhatsApp. OpenAI’s GPT 4.5 “Orion”: OpenAI’s “Orion” is their largest model to date, boasting enhanced “world knowledge” and “emotional intelligence.” Despite these claims, it hasn’t topped all benchmarks compared to newer reasoning-focused models. Orion access is tied to OpenAI’s $200-per-month plan. Claude Sonnet 3.7: Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.7 is touted as the first “hybrid” reasoning model in the industry. This means it can provide quick responses for simpler queries but also engage in deeper, more thoughtful processing when needed. Anthropic also gives users control over the model’s “thinking time.” Sonnet 3.7 is available to all Claude users, but heavier users will need the $20/month Pro plan. xAI’s Grok 3: Grok 3 is the latest flagship model from Elon Musk’s xAI. It reportedly outperforms other leading models in math, science, and coding. Access to Grok 3 requires an X Premium subscription, priced at $50 per month. Following a study suggesting Grok 2 leaned left politically, Musk has stated intentions to make Grok more “politically neutral,” though the current status of this shift is unclear. OpenAI o3-mini: OpenAI’s o3-mini is a reasoning model optimized for STEM fields, including coding, math, and science. While not OpenAI’s most powerful, its smaller size translates to significantly lower costs. It’s available for free, with subscriptions for heavy users. OpenAI Deep Research: OpenAI’s Deep Research is specifically designed for in-depth research, providing clear citations. This service is part of ChatGPT’s $200-per-month Pro subscription. OpenAI suggests it for various research needs, from science to shopping, but it’s important to remember that AI hallucinations can still occur. Mistral Le Chat: Mistral has launched app versions of Le Chat, their multimodal AI personal assistant. Mistral claims Le Chat offers faster response times than other chatbots. A paid version includes up-to-date journalism from AFP. Tests by Le Monde showed impressive performance, though with more errors than ChatGPT. OpenAI Operator: OpenAI’s Operator is conceived as a personal AI intern capable of independent actions, such as grocery shopping. It’s part of the $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro subscription. While AI agents hold great promise, they are still in early stages. A Washington Post review highlighted an instance where Operator autonomously ordered a dozen eggs for $31 using the reviewer’s credit card. Google Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental: Google Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental is their flagship model, excelling in coding and general knowledge. It boasts an exceptionally long context window of 2 million tokens, beneficial for processing large volumes of text. Access requires at least a Google One AI Premium subscription at $19.99 per month. Generative AI Models Launched in 2024: Still Relevant? While 2025 is bringing a wave of new models, some powerful AI tools from 2024 continue to be highly relevant: DeepSeek R1: This Chinese AI model made waves in Silicon Valley. DeepSeek R1 performs strongly in coding and math, and its open-source nature allows for local operation. Plus, it’s free. However, R1 incorporates Chinese government censorship and faces increasing concerns and bans due to potential data transfer to China. Gemini Deep Research: Gemini Deep Research summarizes Google search results into concise, cited documents. Useful for students and anyone needing quick research summaries, its quality doesn’t match peer-reviewed academic papers. Deep Research requires a $19.99 Google One AI Premium subscription. Meta Llama 3.3 70B: This is the latest, most advanced version of Meta’s open-source Llama AI models . Meta promotes it as their most cost-effective and efficient yet, particularly for math, general knowledge, and instruction following. It remains free and open source. OpenAI Sora: Sora is a model that creates realistic videos from text prompts. While it can generate full scenes, OpenAI acknowledges its tendency to produce “unrealistic physics.” Currently, Sora is available on paid ChatGPT plans, starting with Plus at $20 per month. Alibaba Qwen QwQ-32B-Preview: This model rivals OpenAI’s o1 on certain benchmarks, excelling in math and coding. Ironically, for a “reasoning model,” Alibaba notes it has “room for improvement in common sense reasoning.” Bitcoin World testing has confirmed it also includes Chinese government censorship. It’s free and open source. Anthropic’s Computer Use Claude: Claude’s Computer Use is designed to control your computer for tasks like coding or booking flights, a precursor to OpenAI’s Operator. However, Computer Use is still in beta. Pricing is API-based: $0.80 per million input tokens and $4 per million output tokens. xAI’s Grok 2: xAI launched Grok 2, an enhanced version of their Grok chatbot, claiming it’s “three times faster.” Free users are limited to 10 questions every two hours, while X Premium subscribers get higher limits. xAI also released Aurora, an image generator producing highly photorealistic images, sometimes including graphic content. OpenAI o1: OpenAI’s o1 family aims to provide better answers through a hidden reasoning process. OpenAI claims it excels in coding, math, and safety but also exhibits deceptive tendencies. o1 access requires a ChatGPT Plus subscription ($20/month). Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.5: Claude Sonnet 3.5 is touted by Anthropic as best-in-class, known for its coding prowess and favored by tech insiders. It’s free on Claude, with a $20/month Pro subscription for heavy users. It understands images but cannot generate them. OpenAI GPT 4o-mini: OpenAI’s GPT 4o-mini is their most affordable and fastest model, designed for tasks like customer service chatbots. It’s available on ChatGPT’s free tier and is better for high-volume, simpler tasks than complex ones. Cohere Command R+: Cohere’s Command R+ excels in complex retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for enterprises, meaning it’s highly effective at finding and citing specific information. (The inventor of RAG works at Cohere.) However, RAG doesn’t completely eliminate AI hallucinations. Choosing the Right AI Tools for Your Needs With such a diverse range of latest AI models available, how do you choose the right one? Consider these factors: Intended Use: What do you need the AI for? Coding? Image generation? Research? Customer service? Different models excel in different areas. Budget: Many models offer free tiers or subscriptions at various price points. Factor in the cost of access. Performance: Consider benchmarks and real-world reviews for the tasks you need to perform. Data Privacy and Security: Be aware of data handling policies, especially with models that raise censorship or data transfer concerns. Ease of Use: Some models are more user-friendly than others. Consider your technical expertise. Generative AI : Beyond the Hype Generative AI is rapidly changing how we interact with technology. These advanced AI models are not just about chatbots; they are becoming integral tools for content creation, research, automation, and much more. While the hype is real, it’s important to approach these tools with a critical eye. Hallucinations, biases, and ethical concerns are still present. However, the potential of these AI models to revolutionize industries and daily life is undeniable. Stay Updated on the AI Innovation Wave The AI models landscape is constantly evolving.

In a March 28 Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Florida-based Bitcoin miner disclosed that it’s teaming up with several major investment firms to sell shares “from time to time” under a new at-the-market offering. The company said in an accompanying prospectus that proceeds will go toward general corporate purposes, but it made it clear that buying more Bitcoin is high on the list. According to the prospectus, MARA may sell its stock through firms like Barclays, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Guggenheim Securities, with sales happening directly on Nasdaq or via negotiated transactions. The offering will give MARA the flexibility to tap into the market as needed, with no set timeline or volume commitment. As of March 30, MARA shares were trading at $11.89, down 4.6% in overnight trading following an 8.6% drop on March 28. MARA already holds over 46,000 BTC worth nearly $4 billion, and the latest move reaffirms its commitment to a “full HODL” strategy under which it plans to keep all the Bitcoin it mines and buy more to stockpile for the long haul. You might also like: MARA Holdings stock down 5% amid concerning Bitcoin production announcement This latest offering follows a $1.5 billion ATM program launched last year and a $1 billion zero-coupon convertible note sale in November, also aimed at boosting its Bitcoin holdings. MARA, second only to Strategy in corporate Bitcoin holdings, is following a similar playbook to Michael Saylor’s firm, which recently unveiled plans to raise up to $21 billion via its STRK preferred stock offering as part of its “21/21” roadmap. Plans to stack up more Bitcoin follow a profitable run for MARA. In Q4 2024, the company pulled in $214.4 million in revenue , up 37% from the previous quarter, and ended the year with a net income of $528.3 million, a 248% jump year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA surged 207% to $794.4 million, setting a new benchmark for the mining sector. Last month, MARA also wrapped up its acquisition of a wind farm in Hansford County, Texas. The site, which offers 114 megawatts of wind power and 240 MW of interconnection capacity, was acquired to power older mining rigs that would’ve otherwise been retired.

Japan might be preparing to classify cryptocurrencies as financial products in a move to target insider trading, Nikkei has learned . The country’s financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency , is said to be planning a bill to revise the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, which could be submitted to parliament as early as 2026. As of press time, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) are treated as a means of settlement under the Payment Services Act, as they were initially expected to be used mainly for payments. If reclassified, they will likely be placed in a different category from traditional securities like stocks.

If crypto gets classified as a financial product, companies pitching investments might have to register with regulators — not just exchanges — since authorities are reportedly seeing more complaints from investors who feel they were misled into buying crypto. According to the report, the FSA might enforce stricter rules regardless of a company’s location, though it remains unclear how exactly the agency is planning to enforce the new rules. Earlier in March, Japan’s Cabinet signed off on a proposal to amend the Payment Services Act, aiming to loosen regulations for stablecoins and crypto brokerages, and making it easier for crypto firms to set up a presence in Japan.

From looming tariffs to whale-sized BTC bid activity, here are five major factors that market participants need to keep on their radar. #1 US Tariffs Poised To Escalate On April 2 The global stage is bracing for what US President Donald Trump has dubbed “Liberation Day” on April 2. According to The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter), the administration’s plan for “reciprocal tariffs” promises to be a watershed moment in ongoing international trade disputes. “President Trump has been discussing this Wednesday, April 2nd, for weeks. This is a day that he has named ‘Liberation Day’ where widespread new tariffs are coming. We believe April 2nd will be the biggest escalation of the trade war to date,” The Kobeissi Letter writes via X. These tariffs will layer on top of a slew of existing US duties that span steel, aluminum, Canadian goods, Mexican goods, and many Chinese imports. The Kobeissi Letter points out that 25% levies on auto imports and on countries purchasing Venezuelan oil will also take effect this week. With retaliatory measures from Canada, China, the EU, and Mexico in the pipeline, they warn of a “massive trade war,” intensifying uncertainty for global markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Bottomed, Now The Road To $1 Million Begins, Says Arthur Hayes Beyond trade specifics, the coming days could see inflation pressure intensify due to higher consumer costs on imported goods. Citing an uptick in the Economy Policy Uncertainty Index, The Kobeissi Letter highlights: “Policy uncertainty is currently above just about any crisis in modern US history. We are seeing ~80% HIGHER uncertainty levels than 2008. As a result, market swings are widening, and we expect an extremely volatile week.” Add in President Trump’s latest threats regarding Iran—where “secondary tariffs” and potential levies on Russian oil are on the table—and there are multiple international flashpoints that may feed into market volatility. #2 Bitcoin Whale Activity In the Bitcoin arena, large-scale liquidity maneuvers remain a focal point. Keith Alan (@KAProductions), co-founder of Material Indicators, drew attention to a potential whale strategy in action—attributed to a figure he dubs “Spoofy the Whale.” “My first clue that something was up came with a sequence of micro movements that seemed to be a little different than his typical price adjustment of his massive blocks of ask liquidity. At a closer look I noticed a ladder of BTC bid liquidity perfectly aligned and moving with the ask liquidity. While I have no real way of confirming that it is the same entity using ask liquidity to herd price into their own bids, it certainly appears that Spoofy has been buying this dip and has bids laddered down to $78k,” Alan wrote on Sunday. He also noted the convergence of several news events—Sunday’s weekly close, Monday’s monthly close, and the expected tariff implementation midweek—that may catalyze further price swings. While acknowledging BTC could still go lower, he underlined the whale’s apparent commitment to accumulating at current levels: “In the grand scheme of things, none of this means BTC price can’t go lower, but it does mean that the whale that has been suppressing BTC price for the last 3 weeks is using a DCA strategy to buy this dip…and so am I.” #3 Bitcoin Bearish Flag Breakdown Technical analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) is warning traders to keep a close eye on pivotal support levels following a bearish flag breakdown: “We were tracking this bearish flag pattern all last week and as we can see we had a breakdown of that weakness. If BTC does lose the golden pocket here at $81K and follows through with that measured move target, then the $70K–$73K range … would be the ‘Measured Move’ target.” Still, Kevin posits that, given widespread negative sentiment around April 2 (“Armageddon Day” in some corners of the media), there is a possibility of a contrarian twist: “Will the Tariff implementation on April 2nd be a rare ‘sell the rumor buy the news event’? … Everyone thinks the world is suddenly going to end.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders In Extreme Panic And Fear — What This Means He also added: “A little bit of long liquidity at the $78K-$80K level but a lot of juice in the $87K-$89K (Dark Yellow) range for market makers to transact in right before the CNBC proclaimed “Armageddon Day” on April 2nd. Makes me wonder.” #4 Seasoned Players Accumulate From an on-chain perspective, Axel Adler Jr, an analyst at CryptoQuant, observes that experienced market participants are moving into a new accumulation phase. Drawing from the Value Days Destroyed (VDD) indicator, Adler identifies a series of four distinct accumulation periods since early 2023, marking the current cycle as ripe for potential long-term upside: “The absence of significant selling in the current phase demonstrates the confidence of these experienced players that the current BTC price level is not favorable for profit-taking.” Adler underlines that historical data shows low VDD periods often precede price increases, suggesting a bullish medium-term outlook—provided macro factors, including global economic policy shifts, do not derail market sentiment. #5 CME Gap Lastly, traders need to watch the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) gap formation, which has been a notable feature in Bitcoin’s price action. Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) highlighted the recent filling of a gap between $82,000 and $85,000: “BTC has filled the general CME Gap area from $82k–$85k. Moreover, Bitcoin will probably develop a brand new CME Gap over this weekend … Which could set BTC up for a move into at least $84k next week.” CME gaps often act as magnets for price action, and Rekt Capital’s analysis suggests a possible retracement to fill newly formed gaps or a continuation move that takes BTC higher, depending on how broader market forces unfold this week. At press time, BTC traded at $82,010.

Apple is reportedly developing a groundbreaking AI coach for its Health app, poised to revolutionize how we approach our well-being. Imagine having a personalized, AI-powered health guru right in your pocket, guiding you towards a healthier lifestyle. This isn’t just another app update; it’s a leap into the future of health apps , promising a proactive and deeply customized wellness journey. Let’s dive into what this exciting development could mean for you and the future of digital health. What’s the Buzz About Apple’s AI Health Coach? According to Bloomberg’s reliable tech reporter, Mark Gurman, Apple is significantly revamping its Health app to incorporate an AI health coach . This isn’t a fleeting idea; it’s a project that has been in development for some time and is now gaining serious momentum. The expected launch timeframe? Potentially as early as spring or summer of 2026, coinciding with the anticipated release of iOS 19.4. This ambitious timeline suggests Apple is committed to making personalized, AI-driven health guidance a core feature of its ecosystem. This move could redefine how users interact with their health data and take actionable steps towards wellness. For those in the cryptocurrency world, always seeking cutting-edge tech and transformative trends, this development in AI powered health is definitely one to watch. Decoding the AI Health Coach: How Will It Work? The magic behind this AI health coach lies in its ability to synthesize data from your various medical devices. Think of it as a central intelligence hub for your health metrics. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: Data Aggregation: The AI will pull data from a range of sources – your Apple Watch, connected scales, sleep trackers, and potentially even integrated medical devices. Personalized Insights: Instead of just presenting raw data, the AI will analyze this information to provide personalized advice tailored to your specific health profile and goals. Food Tracking Integration: A crucial component reportedly includes food tracking. This suggests the AI will offer dietary recommendations and monitor your nutritional intake, a cornerstone of any effective health plan. Expert Training: To ensure accuracy and reliability, the AI is being trained using data from staff physicians. Apple is even looking to expand this by incorporating health-related videos from additional doctors, adding a layer of expert-backed guidance. Tentative Name: Health+: While subject to change, the service is currently being referred to as Health+, hinting at a premium, enhanced health experience. Imagine receiving proactive suggestions like, “Based on your sleep patterns and activity levels, consider adjusting your evening routine to improve sleep quality,” or “Your food log indicates a need for more protein in your diet; here are some healthy sources.” This level of personalized, actionable advice marks a significant step forward in proactive healthcare. The Promise of a Digital Health Revolution: Benefits of an AI Coach The introduction of an AI health coach in the Apple Health app isn’t just a feature upgrade; it signals a potential digital health revolution . Here’s why this development is so significant: Benefit Description Personalized Health Guidance Move beyond generic health tips. Receive advice tailored to your unique data, lifestyle, and health objectives. Proactive Health Management Shift from reactive healthcare (addressing issues after they arise) to proactive prevention and early intervention through AI-driven insights. Increased Engagement Interactive AI coaching can make health management more engaging and less daunting, fostering consistent healthy habits. Accessible Expert Advice Democratize access to personalized health advice, potentially bridging gaps in healthcare access and affordability. Data-Driven Wellness Make informed decisions about your health based on concrete data analysis, rather than relying on general guidelines or guesswork. For individuals keen on optimizing their well-being, particularly those engaged in fast-paced and demanding fields like cryptocurrency, having an AI powered health assistant could be invaluable for maintaining peak performance and preventing burnout. Navigating the Challenges: What to Consider? While the prospect of an AI health coach is exciting, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Data Privacy and Security: Entrusting sensitive health data to an AI system raises critical questions about privacy and security. Robust data protection measures are paramount. Accuracy and Reliability of AI Advice: The effectiveness of the AI coach hinges on the accuracy of its algorithms and the quality of its training data. Continuous validation and refinement will be crucial. User Adoption and Trust: Building user trust in AI-driven health advice is essential. Transparency in how the AI works and clear communication about its limitations will be key to widespread adoption. Integration Complexity: Seamless integration across various devices and health platforms will be vital for a user-friendly and effective experience. The Human Element: While AI can provide valuable insights, the human element of healthcare – empathy, nuanced understanding, and complex decision-making – remains irreplaceable. The AI coach should be seen as a powerful tool to augment, not replace, human healthcare professionals. Addressing these challenges proactively will be crucial to ensure that the future of health apps , powered by AI, is both beneficial and responsible. Is This the Future of Personal Wellness? Apple’s foray into AI-driven health coaching strongly suggests a significant shift towards personalized and proactive wellness management. The potential for an AI health coach to empower individuals to take control of their health is immense. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, Apple is positioning itself at the forefront of the digital health revolution , aiming to make sophisticated health guidance accessible to millions. As we eagerly anticipate the arrival of iOS 19.4 and the potential launch of Health+, it’s clear that the convergence of AI and personal health is poised to transform how we live healthier, more informed lives.

The block data shows Uniswap plunged from 99 to 364 in ranking within two months. Source – The Block The substantial shift came after the protocol soared to new heights following Donald Trump’s presidential victory. The key development has grabbed investor attention, with many speculating about the native coin UNI and its short-term price actions. Uniswap loses momentum after Trump-fueled growth Uniswap displayed resilience throughout last year, ranking in the 190s. However, magnified bullishness after the US election results propelled the platform to the 110s. Cryptocurrencies rallied to record highs after Trump’s win due to the president’s pro-crypto attitude. The optimism overflowed into 2025, with Trump’s inauguration pushing Uniswap to rank 99 in January. The connection between Uniswap’s rising popularity and political developments confirms that enthusiasts expected a favorable environment for crypto business under the Trump administration. Uniswap’s swift growth reflected similar trends in the digital assets market. Cryptocurrencies flew to record peaks after Donald Trump’s inauguration, with Bitcoin holding above $100K . The swift shifts in Uniswap rankings Nevertheless, the market failed to keep the momentum. Uniswap has gradually dropped in finance app rankings since January, even hitting lows not seen during its 2023 struggles. Fading election-fueled optimism and a broad market correction catalyzed the significant plunge. In addition, intensifying DEX competition, with PancakeSwap dominating , dented Uniswap’s market position. While still a key player within the DeFi world, Uniswap’s declining app store ranking reflects the hurdles cryptocurrency platforms face after hype-driven surges. Speculative interest, not solid adoption, fueled Uniswap’s growth, explaining the recent sharp plummets. Also, the crypto market has slumped after the US election wave. Sustained bearish pressure in recent months has pushed Bitcoin down to around $82,000 at press time. The significant dips and market instability often affect DEXs as participants change their approaches according to broad-based trends. UNI price outlook The token trades at $5.90 following a 1.75% dip in the past 24 hours. Chart by Coinmarketcap UNI demonstrated robust bearishness after losing 13% and 22% in the past week and month, respectively. Crypto trader TA highlighted Uniswap’s weakness. The chart shows a sharp decline from UNI’s previous peak at around $18.98. The nearly 70% price crash has triggered debates about whether the alt will hit new lows soon. The steep drop matches the declines in app store rankings, confirming persistent Uniswap downtrends. The altcoin lacks a reliable support barrier until $5.51 – 6.6% away from UNI’s current price.

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $196.48 million in net inflows over the past week, a drop of 73.6% from the week prior, which saw $744.35 million enter the funds. Notably, Bitcoin ETFs recorded net positive flows in the first four days of the week of March 24–28, starting with $84.17 million on Monday, followed by $26.83 million, $89.57 million, and $89.06 million. However, these investment products saw a shift in investor sentiment, ending the week with a net outflow of $93.16 million on Friday. The majority of inflows were captured by BlackRock’s IBIT, which drew in $172 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $86.8 million per Faside data . Modest positive momentum also came from VanEck’s HODL, which saw $5 million in net inflows. However, it wasn’t entirely a bullish week across the board, as ARK 21Shares’ ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB, WisdomTree’s BTCW and Invesco’s BTCO still saw combined outflows of $67.4 million. The remaining BTC ETFs remained flat over the five days. You might also like: Bitcoin, altcoins at risk as Nasdaq 100, S&P 500 hit death crosses Notably, the outflows seen on Friday, March 28, ended a 10-day streak of inflows , which also marked the longest inflow run of the year, bringing in nearly $1.07 billion into the funds. Analysts described the figure as relatively modest, noting that while there is demand for Bitcoin, investors are not showing an aggressive risk appetite. Meanwhile, the sharp shift in investor mood on Friday came as Bitcoin’s quarterly performance is turning out to be its worst since 2018, when it crashed by 49.7%. So far this quarter, Bitcoin is down 11.86% at $81,939, which is even worse than the 10.83% drop in Q1 2020. If prices bounce back a bit, the loss might end up being smaller than in 2020, but if the selling pressure continues, Bitcoin could dip below the $80,000 mark. The recent sell-off erased almost all of Bitcoin’s weekly gains as investors remained cautious ahead of President Trump’s U.S. reciprocal tariffs set to take effect on April 2. Additionally, stronger-than-expected core PCE data have raised concerns about a potential delay in Federal Reserve rate cuts, adding to market uncertainty.

In a new interview on The Your Life! Your Terms! YouTube channel, Alden says she’s keeping a close watch on Bitcoin’s market value to realized value (MVRV) metric, an on-chain indicator that helps assess whether BTC is overvalued or undervalued by comparing its market cap (market value) to the average price at which all coins were last moved (realized value). The macro guru explains that during the initial stages of a bull market, Bitcoin’s market cap tends to soar, while its average cost basis lags as early investors hold on to their coins in anticipation of more rallies, resulting in a higher MVRV value. Alden says that when the MVRV soars to extreme levels, it drives more long-term investors to unload their holdings, which can signal the start of a multi-year bear market. For now, the macro expert says the metric is still within its usual bull market range, leading her to believe that BTC can still soar to greater heights. “When you see more and more coins at those higher price levels, it helps lower that ratio because basically the average cost basis is catching up to some extent with that wild explosion in market cap. So what I generally point out is that we’ve not really seen extremes yet this year. Back in March 2024, when we broke out to new all-time highs for the first time in a couple of years, Bitcoin hit $73,000. That metric got a little bit euphoric, but nothing like a multi-year top historically has been. And so we saw a seven-month consolidation, but nothing really worse than that. Similarly, when Bitcoin hit $108,000 more recently, that metric got a little bit overdone, but again, it wasn’t those multi-year dislocations that we normally see. For me, I’m more on the lookout for probabilities of breaking out versus breaking down. And so my view is that there’s still a higher probability of breaking up and to say that, I don’t think we’re set for a multi-year bear market until we probably reach higher prices.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $81,357.

Perplexity, the AI search engine making waves, recently found itself at the center of such speculation. Concerns arose about the company’s financial health, fueled by user observations and online theories. But fear not, crypto and tech enthusiasts! Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has stepped forward to set the record straight, directly addressing these concerns and outlining the exciting path ahead for the AI startup . Addressing Financial Issue Speculation: What Did the Perplexity CEO Say? Recent online discussions, particularly on platforms like Reddit, suggested that Perplexity was facing significant financial issues . Users pointed to changes in product features, like the ‘Auto mode’, as potential cost-cutting measures, sparking worries about the company’s stability. One user theory even went as far as to claim Perplexity was “doing horribly financially.” However, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas took a proactive approach to dispel these rumors. In a direct response on Reddit, Srinivas addressed user complaints and firmly reassured the community about Perplexity’s financial standing. He clarified that the introduction of ‘Auto mode’ wasn’t a cost-cutting tactic but a strategic move to enhance user experience. According to Srinivas, the goal was to simplify the user interface and reduce the overwhelming number of options and menus that are becoming common in many AI products today. He emphasized that the intention was to make the product more user-friendly, stating, “The user shouldn’t have to learn so much to use a product.” No Imminent IPO: Perplexity’s Long-Term Vision Beyond addressing immediate financial concerns, Aravind Srinivas also tackled questions about a potential Initial Public Offering ( IPO ). In the current economic climate, the prospect of tech companies going public is a hot topic, and Perplexity is no exception, given its rapid growth and innovative approach to AI search. Srinivas definitively stated, “We have all the funding we’ve raised, and our revenue is only growing.” This statement directly counters any notion of immediate financial pressure forcing the company’s hand. Furthermore, he clearly communicated Perplexity’s long-term strategy regarding public offering, asserting, “[We have] no plans of IPOing before 2028.” This timeline provides Perplexity with significant runway to further develop its technology, expand its market presence, and solidify its position in the competitive AI startup landscape. It signals a focus on sustainable growth and innovation rather than rushing into the public markets. Key Takeaways from Perplexity CEO’s Statement Let’s break down the key points from Aravind Srinivas’s reassuring message: Financial Stability Confirmed: Perplexity is not facing financial difficulties. Revenue is growing, and existing funding is sufficient. ‘Auto Mode’ is User-Centric: The feature is designed to improve user experience by simplifying the interface, not to cut costs. IPO on Hold: No plans for an IPO before 2028, indicating a long-term focus on growth and development as a private company. Focus on Innovation: Perplexity is committed to continuous product improvement and user-friendliness in the evolving AI space. What Does This Mean for the Future of Perplexity and AI Search? The CEO’s candid response provides valuable insights into Perplexity’s current state and future direction. By directly addressing rumors and outlining a clear path forward, Srinivas has instilled confidence in users, investors, and the broader tech community. For those in the cryptocurrency space, which is increasingly intertwined with AI technologies, Perplexity’s commitment to innovation and sustainable growth is a positive sign. Perplexity’s approach to AI search, prioritizing user experience and simplifying complex technology, could be a game-changer in how we interact with information online. Their focus on remaining private for the foreseeable future allows them to prioritize long-term strategic goals over short-term market pressures. This could lead to more groundbreaking innovations and a stronger, more user-focused AI search engine in the years to come.

While emphasizing that India is already at an advanced stage in CBDC development, they mentioned their advisory role in helping other countries transition to digital currencies. WOW!

The potential use of XRP within private ledgers by Indian banks could indicate a move toward enhanced efficiency in cross-border and domestic settlements. Private ledgers built on XRP technology are designed to provide scalability and cost-effective transactions for financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple has previously engaged with central banks and financial institutions worldwide to facilitate CBDC development and streamline payment systems. The mention of XRP in the fintech event suggests that Indian banks may be evaluating its use in their financial ecosystem. However, there has been no official confirmation from Indian regulators or banks regarding large-scale adoption. India’s Role in BRICS and Financial Innovation India’s involvement in BRICS, alongside Brazil, Russia, China, and South Africa, is crucial to its financial and geopolitical strategy. BRICS nations have explored alternative payment mechanisms to reduce dependence on traditional global financial systems. If Indian banks proceed with private ledger integration using XRP, it could align with broader BRICS efforts to enhance economic independence and improve settlement frameworks. The Indian government and financial sector have been cautious in their approach to digital assets while simultaneously advancing CBDC initiatives. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been conducting trials for its digital rupee, and any collaboration involving XRP technology would likely be positioned within a regulated framework. Amelie’s statement about Indian banks testing XRP private ledgers reflects ongoing blockchain experimentation in the banking sector. While the extent of these trials remains unclear, the discussion at the fintech festival indicates active engagement with blockchain-based financial solutions. The relationship between XRP technology and India’s economic infrastructure could develop further, depending on regulatory decisions and institutional adoption.

The altcoins have taken this beating even worse, with many posting double-digit price declines on a weekly scale, pushing the total market cap south to $2.750 billion. BTC Keeps Plunging A lot can change in the cryptocurrency markets within the span of a week, and this narrative proved right once again in the past seven days. Recall that bitcoin shot up to $88,800 last Monday, which became its highest price tag in over two weeks. Although it faced rejection there, it remained above $86,000 for the next several days. Tha was until Friday when the $86,000 support gave in and BTC started losing value gradually. The weekly culmination came during the weekend when bitcoin slipped to $81,600. Although it bounced off initially and went above $83,000 on Sunday, the bears regained control on Monday morning with another leg down. This time, BTC went even further south to $81,300 (on Bitstamp), which became a new two-week low. As of now, BTC struggles to remain above $82,000, trading seven grand lower than this time last week. Its market capitalization has plunged to $1.630 trillion on CG, but its dominance over the altcoins is up to 59.2%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Altcoins on a Downfall The growing BTC dominance in times of market retracement means only one thing – alts have it worse. The biggest losers from the larger caps are SUI, HBAR, LEO, and XRP , with price declines of up to 8%. DOGE, ADA, BNB, LINK, and XLM are also in the red on a daily scale, but in a less painful manner. However, the weekly chart is a lot more violent. ETH, XRP, ADA, LINK, AVAX, HBAR, and LTC have all plunged by double-digits. In contrast, CRO has gained 20% while TON is up by 6%.

The winds of economic uncertainty are picking up speed, and this time, it’s not just about market corrections or regulatory crackdowns. Whispers from Washington suggest a policy shift that could send shockwaves across global markets, potentially impacting everything from your favorite altcoins to the broader financial landscape. We’re talking about global tariffs – and not just a little tweak, but a potentially massive 20% import tax proposed by advisors to the Trump administration. Let’s dive deep into what this could mean for the world and, more importantly, for your crypto portfolio. What Exactly Are Global Tariffs and Why Should Crypto Holders Care? In simple terms, global tariffs are taxes imposed on goods imported from other countries. Think of it as a surcharge added to the price of everything from smartphones to steel, making imported products more expensive. While tariffs are sometimes used strategically, the scale being discussed here – a blanket 20% on goods from almost all nations – is unprecedented in recent history. Why should you, as someone invested in cryptocurrencies, be concerned? Because international trade and the global economy are intricately linked. A significant disruption in trade flows, like that potentially triggered by widespread tariffs, can have cascading effects: Market Volatility: Uncertainty breeds volatility. Stock markets could react negatively, and as we’ve seen, traditional market jitters often spill over into the crypto space. Inflationary Pressures: Higher import costs can translate to increased prices for consumers, leading to inflation. While some see Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, the immediate impact of broad inflation can be complex. Economic Slowdown: A trade war sparked by these tariffs could stifle global economic growth, impacting investment sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Geopolitical Instability: Retaliatory tariffs from other nations are highly likely, escalating trade tensions and potentially leading to broader geopolitical instability, which can further fuel market uncertainty. In essence, while cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized, global stage, they are not immune to the ripples caused by macroeconomic shifts and policy decisions in major economies like the United States. The Trump Administration’s 20% Import Tax: A Closer Look According to reports citing the Wall Street Journal, advisors within the Trump administration are seriously considering imposing an import tax of up to 20% on goods from nearly every country. This isn’t a targeted tariff on specific goods or nations; it’s a broad-stroke approach that aims to reshape global trade dynamics. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: Scope: Potentially applies to goods from almost all nations, excluding perhaps a very select few. Magnitude: Up to 20%, a significant increase compared to typical tariffs. Rationale (Speculated): Likely aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing, reducing trade deficits, and potentially as a tool for political leverage in international negotiations. Retaliation Risk: The proposal explicitly mentions considering “retaliatory tariffs,” suggesting an awareness that other countries will likely respond in kind. This proposal is still in the consideration phase, but the fact that it’s being discussed at high levels within the administration is enough to raise eyebrows and trigger market speculation. The sheer scale of a 20% import tax is what makes this particularly noteworthy and potentially disruptive. Potential Benefits and the “America First” Argument Proponents of such tariffs, often aligned with an “America First” approach, argue that they can bring several benefits: Boosting Domestic Industries: By making imports more expensive, domestically produced goods become more competitive, potentially leading to a resurgence in American manufacturing. Reducing Trade Deficits: Tariffs could decrease imports, theoretically narrowing the trade deficit. Increased Government Revenue: Tariff revenue could provide the government with additional funds. However, these perceived benefits often come with significant drawbacks, and the economic consensus leans heavily against broad-based tariffs as an effective long-term strategy. Challenges and the Looming Threat of a Trade War The potential downsides of implementing Trump tariffs of this magnitude are considerable: Challenge Impact Increased Consumer Prices Tariffs are ultimately paid by consumers through higher prices for goods and services. This can erode purchasing power and lead to inflation. Retaliatory Tariffs and Trade Wars Other countries are highly likely to retaliate with their own tariffs on US exports, leading to a trade war where everyone loses. This can severely disrupt global supply chains and economic growth. Damage to International Relations Unilateral tariffs can strain diplomatic relationships and undermine international trade agreements. Negative Impact on Export-Oriented Industries Retaliatory tariffs will hurt US export industries, offsetting any potential gains for domestic manufacturers focused on the local market. Supply Chain Disruptions Global supply chains are complex and interconnected. Tariffs can disrupt these chains, leading to inefficiencies and higher costs for businesses. The prospect of a full-blown trade war is a significant concern. History is replete with examples of trade wars leading to economic downturns and heightened international tensions. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in the 1930s, for instance, is widely blamed for exacerbating the Great Depression. Examples from History: Learning from Past Tariff Policies Looking back at historical examples of tariffs can provide valuable context: The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (1930): As mentioned, this US tariff hike is widely considered a major policy blunder that deepened the Great Depression. It triggered retaliatory tariffs and a sharp contraction in global trade. Trump Administration Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum (2018): While narrower in scope than the current proposal, these tariffs led to retaliatory measures from trading partners and had mixed economic effects. Some domestic industries benefited, but others faced higher input costs. US-China Trade War (2018-2020): This protracted trade dispute involved tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods traded between the US and China. It resulted in economic disruptions for both countries and globally. These examples highlight the potential for tariffs to backfire and cause unintended negative consequences. A 20% global tariff would be on a scale far exceeding recent examples, making the potential risks even greater. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Uncertainty in the Crypto Market So, what can crypto investors do amidst this uncertainty? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and developments related to trade policy and global economics. Reliable financial news sources and crypto market analysis platforms are crucial. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is always a good strategy, especially during times of uncertainty. Consider spreading your investments across different asset classes and cryptocurrencies. Risk Management: Reassess your risk tolerance and adjust your portfolio accordingly. Consider using stop-loss orders and other risk management tools to protect your capital. Consider Stablecoins: In periods of high volatility, stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies can offer a temporary safe haven within the crypto ecosystem. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that market volatility is a normal part of the crypto cycle. Focus on the long-term fundamentals of your chosen projects and avoid making rash decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. It’s crucial to remember that this is still a developing situation. The proposed global tariffs may not be implemented in their current form, or at all. However, the fact that they are under consideration warrants attention and careful planning. Conclusion: Bracing for Potential Economic Tremors The prospect of a 20% global tariff imposed by the Trump administration is a significant development with potentially far-reaching consequences for the global economy and, by extension, the cryptocurrency market. While the stated aims might be to bolster domestic industries and reduce trade deficits, the risks of triggering a global trade war, increasing inflation, and disrupting supply chains are substantial. For crypto investors, navigating this uncertainty requires vigilance, diversification, and a focus on risk management. The coming weeks and months will be crucial in determining the future trajectory of global trade policy and its impact on the digital asset landscape. Stay informed, stay prepared, and remember that in the world of crypto, volatility is often accompanied by opportunity.

Ethereum, currently trading around $1,911, remains the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem. Polygon (POL), priced at $0.22, continues to thrive as a top Layer-2 scaling solution, attracting major partnerships and developers. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding strong bullish momentum, positioning itself as top performers for explosive growth in the coming months. The project is in phase 4 of its presale priced at $0.025. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $5.8 million with over 7500 investors already onboard. In phase 5 the price will jump 20% to $0.03. MUTM could be the next big winner for those who seek greater gains and long term investment. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. This two-pronged approach maximizes security, efficiency, and decentralization and positions Mutuum Finance at the forefront of the DeFi universe. By giving users full control over their lending decisions, the platform is appealing to conservative and high-yield investors, and facilitates a more open and flexible financial system. Mutuum Finance establishes its security foundation through the launch of an entirely collateralized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The over-collateralization requirement in this model eliminates volatility risks that break algorithmic stablecoins due to their instability. The platform establishes investor confidence by employing multiple auditing activities on smart contracts together with financially transparent systems to repair DeFi lending platform vulnerabilities. Mutuum Finance emphasizes sustainability and security thus establishing itself as an excellent option for investors making long-term decisions. Exclusive Rewards and Community Incentives The initial supporters of Mutuum Finance can benefit from multiple enticing rewards which offer both generous giveaways of $100,000 awarded through $10,000 MUTM token distributions to ten winners alongside a referral program that rewards its users for new investor acquisitions. The referral system of Mutuum Finance motivates users to recruit new investors while providing rewards to these referrals. Users who join early receive privileged access to future staking pools and they obtain governance privileges while receiving first access to platform upgrade updates. The incentives provided by Mutuum Finance motivate users to join initially while developing better long-term retention of token holders. A Strategic Vision for Sustainable Growth Mutuum Finance created its tokenomics framework to promote sustainable value through proper management of liquidity and strategic partnerships and security features with anti-inflation measures. The basis for enduring token price appreciation comes from a controlled distribution process during the presale phase alongside proper management techniques. The payout system for token staking pumps out steady passive revenue which retains both investors’ commitment and protects token sustainability levels. The deflationary mechanisms function over time to reduce network supply which leads to increased scarcity thereby strengthening price growth potential for the long term. Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (POL), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are emerging as top picks for the next crypto bull cycle. While ETH and POL continue to dominate DeFi and Layer-2 scaling, MUTM is gaining traction with its hybrid DeFi lending model. Currently in Phase 4 of its presale at $0.025, MUTM has already raised $5.8 million from 7,500+ investors. The price is set to increase 20% in Phase 5, with a launch target of $0.06. With strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential, this could be a golden opportunity for investors before the next market surge.

42685970,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144615,1743406215,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Visionary Forecast: 25% of S&P 500 Companies Predicted to Embrace Bitcoin by 2030,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sp500-companies-bitcoin-adoption/,"Is Bitcoin poised to become a mainstay in corporate America’s financial strategy? A new report suggests a potentially seismic shift in how major companies manage their treasuries. Elliot Chun, a partner at crypto advisory firm Architect Partners, has made a visionary prediction: by 2030, a quarter of the S&P 500 companies will be holding Bitcoin (BTC) on their balance sheets as a long-term asset. This isn’t just a casual forecast; it’s a data-backed assertion that could reshape the financial landscape. Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing prediction and explore what it could mean for the future of corporate treasury and Bitcoin adoption . Why Bet on Bitcoin? The Rationale Behind the Prediction Chun’s prediction isn’t based on a whim. He grounds his analysis in compelling performance data, comparing the growth of the S&P 500 against Bitcoin and MicroStrategy (MSTR), a company famously known for its significant Bitcoin holdings. The data spans from August 20, 2020, to March 28, 2025, revealing some striking contrasts: S&P 500 Increase: 64.81% Bitcoin (BTC) Rise: A staggering 781.13% MicroStrategy (MSTR) Gain: An astounding 2,074.85% These figures paint a clear picture. While the S&P 500 delivered solid growth, Bitcoin and especially Bitcoin-centric investments like MicroStrategy significantly outperformed it during this period. Chun argues that this performance differential cannot be ignored by corporate treasury managers. He suggests that failing to consider Bitcoin as a potential investment, without a robust justification, could be seen as a risky stance in itself. The implication is clear: institutional investment in Bitcoin isn’t just a trend; it’s potentially a necessary evolution in corporate finance. The Current Landscape: How Many Companies Already Hold Bitcoin? While the 25% figure might seem ambitious, it’s important to understand that Bitcoin adoption by public companies is already underway. As of March 30, data from Bitcoin Treasuries indicates that a substantial 665,621 public companies are already holding BTC. This number, while including smaller entities, signals a growing acceptance of Bitcoin within the corporate world. The question isn’t whether companies are interested in Bitcoin, but rather, how quickly and widely this interest will translate into significant balance sheet allocations, especially among the giants of the S&P 500. Institutional Investment in Bitcoin: What’s Driving the Trend? Several factors are likely fueling the increasing interest in crypto investment among institutions and corporations: Diversification: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds makes it an attractive diversification tool. In a portfolio, it can potentially reduce overall risk and enhance returns. Inflation Hedge: With concerns about inflation rising globally, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against inflationary pressures. Its limited supply of 21 million coins contrasts with fiat currencies, which can be inflated by central banks. Potential for Higher Returns: As highlighted by the data, Bitcoin has demonstrated the potential for significantly higher returns compared to traditional assets. For companies seeking to optimize their treasury reserves, this potential is hard to overlook. Technological Innovation: Embracing Bitcoin can be seen as a forward-thinking move, signaling a company’s willingness to adopt innovative technologies and stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving financial world. These factors, combined with the increasing maturity of the cryptocurrency market and the development of institutional-grade custody solutions, are making it easier and more appealing for S&P 500 companies to consider Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset. Challenges and Considerations for S&P 500 Companies Embracing Bitcoin While the potential benefits are compelling, Bitcoin adoption for S&P 500 companies is not without its challenges. These corporations must navigate a complex landscape of regulatory, accounting, and operational considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility remains a concern. While its long-term growth potential is significant, short-term price swings can be substantial and require careful risk management. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. S&P 500 companies operate under strict regulatory scrutiny, and navigating the uncertainties surrounding crypto regulations requires careful legal and compliance considerations. Accounting Standards: Current accounting standards for digital assets are not fully standardized, which can create complexities in financial reporting and auditing. Security and Custody: Ensuring the secure storage and custody of Bitcoin holdings is paramount. S&P 500 companies need robust, institutional-grade custody solutions to mitigate the risk of theft or loss. ESG Concerns: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors are increasingly important for S&P 500 companies . Bitcoin’s energy consumption has raised environmental concerns, although efforts are underway to promote more sustainable mining practices. Addressing these challenges is crucial for S&P 500 companies considering crypto investment . However, the development of clearer regulations, improved accounting standards, and more sustainable Bitcoin practices is gradually mitigating these concerns. MicroStrategy: A Pioneer in Corporate Treasury Bitcoin Strategy No discussion about corporate treasury and Bitcoin is complete without mentioning MicroStrategy. As Chun’s data highlights, MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has seen explosive growth, significantly outperforming both Bitcoin and the S&P 500. This performance is largely attributed to the company’s bold strategy of adopting Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. MicroStrategy’s journey serves as a real-world case study, demonstrating the potential upside – and the inherent risks – of such a strategy. While not every S&P 500 company may follow MicroStrategy’s aggressive approach, its experience provides valuable lessons and insights for those exploring Bitcoin adoption . Is Bitcoin Right for Your Company? Actionable Insights for Treasury Managers For treasury managers at S&P 500 companies (and beyond), the question isn’t whether to ignore Bitcoin entirely, but rather, how to approach it strategically. Here are some actionable insights: Due Diligence is Key: Thoroughly research and understand Bitcoin, its underlying technology, and its market dynamics. Don’t rely solely on hype; conduct independent analysis and seek expert advice.

The Future is Decentralized: Will Chun’s Prediction Hold True? Elliot Chun’s prediction that 25% of S&P 500 companies will hold Bitcoin by 2030 is undoubtedly ambitious, but it’s grounded in observable trends and compelling data. The increasing institutional investment in Bitcoin, the growing recognition of its potential as a diversification tool and inflation hedge, and the pioneering examples of companies like MicroStrategy all point towards a future where Bitcoin plays a more significant role in corporate treasury . While challenges remain, the momentum is building.

The analyst’s bullish forecast comes at a time when bearish headwinds are causing a downturn across the broader crypto market as XRP struggles to sustain levels above the crucial support of $2. Crypto Investor Shares Brave XRP Price Prediction Crypto investor Random Crypto Pal has shared a bold XRP price prediction and likened the 2017 XRP price rally to the 2025 price movement. He noted that in 2017, Ripple climbed from $0.003 to $3.31, which was an over 110,000% price gain, If it repeats this pattern, XRP could reach $3,000 . Pal’s bullish prediction has attracted criticism from other crypto investors . In response to his X post, one user noted that in 2017, XRP only needed billions of dollars to achieve the $3.31 price within months. However, for an upswing to $3,000, Ripple needed trillions of dollars in buying demand, which was not feasible. More importantly, at a price of $3,000 and a circulating supply of $58 billion, XRP would have a $174 trillion market cap. This is more than six times higher than the annual US GDP. It would also be three times bigger than the entire US stock market, which has a market cap of $69 trillion. This massive market cap valuation shows why a $3,000 XRP price prediction is hilarious. Ripple is unlikely to reach this level with the current amount of token supply. Ripple Technical Analysis As Another Crash Looms XRP price today trades at $2.09 with a 3.6% decline in 24 hours. Ripple is on the verge of another crash and might drop below $2 as investors flee from risk assets amid fears of President Trump’s tariffs and reduced odds that the Federal Reserve will trim interest rates. On the one-day price chart, XRP had formed a rounding top pattern, which signals that the current trend might change to bearish. The height of this rounding top pattern indicates that Ripple could plunge by 17.45% from its current price level of $1.76. Technical indicators support the bearish setup depicted by the rounding top pattern. The RSI is leaning towards being oversold and depicts bearish momentum while the ADX lime is also tipping north, another sign that the downtrend is strong. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart As a recent Coingape article reported, if the XRP price drops below $1.90. It might crash to $1. Given that XRP has already dropped below the neckline of the rounding top, a crash is likely to happen in the near term. XRP’s Liquidation Heatmap Supports Bearish Outlook Besides the rounding top pattern, the liquidation heatmap supports the bearish outlook for XRP . Data from Coinglass shows that there is a hot liquidation zone at $2.05, where many long traders are at risk of being liquidated. XRP Liquidation Heatmap These liquidation zones tend to act as a magnet that pulls the price down. Moreover, the closure of long positions increases selling activity around an asset. This hints towards more bearish trends facing Ripple.

According to the firm, these experienced investors are moving into an accumulation phase, a trend that has historically preceded significant price increases. CryptoQuant identifies four main periods of coin accumulation by experienced market participants: January 2023, October 2023, October 2024, and the current phase in March 2025. These phases are marked with blue circles on the firm’s analysis table. In contrast, four significant selling peaks occurred in January, April, and July of 2024, with the last peak occurring in March 2025, marked with red circles. Related News: Watch Out: 22 Altcoins Will Have Massive Token Unlocks in the New Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List According to the analyst firm, the current accumulation phase is characterized by several critical factors: Shifting from Sell to Hold – Investors who previously sold at market peaks have now adopted a holding strategy. This is evident from the Value Days Destroyed (VDD) indicator, which is at its minimum in March 2025. Lack of Significant Selling – The lack of significant selling suggests that experienced participants find the current Bitcoin price level unattractive for profit-taking. Historical Precedence for Price Increases – Historical market cycles show that periods of low VDD marked by accumulation phases precede upward price movements. CryptoQuant’s findings suggest that the current accumulation phase could signal further appreciation of Bitcoin’s price in the medium term.

Buckle up, because this week’s economic calendar is packed with pivotal US economic data releases that could significantly sway market sentiment and price action, not just in traditional finance but also in the crypto sphere. For crypto enthusiasts and traders, understanding these economic events this week is not just beneficial—it’s crucial for making informed decisions. Let’s dive into the key events and what they might mean for your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Market Moving Events : What’s on the Horizon? This week isn’t just another week in the financial world; it’s a crucial period where market moving events are slated to unfold. These events, primarily emanating from the United States, are closely watched by investors globally, and for good reason. They offer insights into the health of the world’s largest economy and can trigger significant shifts in asset valuations, including cryptocurrencies. We’re talking about data that can influence the Federal Reserve’s decisions, shape investor sentiment, and ultimately, drive market trends. Tuesday, April 1: Manufacturing Sector in Focus The week kicks off with a double dose of manufacturing data on Tuesday. Why manufacturing? Because it’s often seen as a leading indicator of economic health. Strong manufacturing activity can signal robust economic growth, while weakness can hint at a slowdown. 13:45 UTC: U.S. S&P Global Manufacturing PMI (March) The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) from S&P Global provides a snapshot of business conditions in the manufacturing sector. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while below 50 signals contraction. Traders will be looking for trends and deviations from expectations. A stronger-than-expected PMI could be interpreted positively for the dollar and potentially weigh slightly on risk assets initially, but overall economic strength is generally seen as positive in the long run. 14:00 UTC: U.S. ISM Manufacturing PMI (March) Shortly after, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) releases its Manufacturing PMI. This is another closely watched indicator, often considered more influential than the S&P Global PMI due to its broader survey scope. Similar to the S&P PMI, the ISM Manufacturing PMI offers insights into manufacturing activity, new orders, employment, and prices. Consistently strong readings across both PMIs would paint a picture of a resilient manufacturing sector, influencing expectations for economic growth and potentially interest rate policy. Wednesday, April 2: Employment Picture Takes Shape Mid-week brings us a preliminary look at the employment situation, ahead of the more comprehensive Nonfarm Payrolls report on Friday. Employment data is critical as it reflects the labor market’s health, a key factor in economic stability and consumer spending. 12:15 UTC: U.S. ADP Nonfarm Employment Change (March) The ADP Nonfarm Employment Change estimates the change in private sector employment. While it’s not always a perfect predictor of the official Nonfarm Payrolls, it provides valuable insights into the direction of employment trends. A strong ADP report could build anticipation for a robust Nonfarm Payrolls figure, potentially leading to market optimism. Conversely, a weak number could raise concerns about economic slowdown. Friday, April 4: The Employment Grand Finale and Fed Speak Friday is undoubtedly the highlight of the week, featuring the highly anticipated Nonfarm Payrolls report and Unemployment Rate, followed by a speech from Fed Chair Powell. This day could be pivotal in setting the market tone for the near future. 12:30 UTC: U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls (March) This is arguably the most important US economic data release of the week. Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) measures the change in the number of employed people during the previous month, excluding the farming industry. It’s a broad indicator of job creation and overall economic activity. A strong NFP number often boosts confidence in the economy and can lead to dollar strength. For crypto, the immediate reaction might be mixed, as a stronger dollar can sometimes pressure crypto prices in the short term. However, robust economic growth is generally positive for all asset classes in the longer run. 12:30 UTC: U.S. Unemployment Rate (March) Released alongside NFP, the Unemployment Rate measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. A low unemployment rate typically indicates a healthy labor market. Combined with strong NFP, a low unemployment rate reinforces the narrative of a strong economy, which can influence the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance. 15:25 UTC: U.S. Fed Chair Powell Speaks Capping off the week, a speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled. Powell’s remarks are always closely scrutinized for hints about the Fed’s future monetary policy direction, particularly regarding interest rates and inflation. Depending on the context of the economic data released earlier in the week, Powell’s speech could amplify market reactions. For example, if the data points to a strong economy and potential inflationary pressures, hawkish comments from Powell could signal a more aggressive approach to interest rate hikes, potentially impacting risk assets including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, dovish remarks in the face of weaker data could be seen as supportive for risk assets. Crypto Market Impact : Navigating the Volatility So, how do these financial markets events tie into the cryptocurrency world? In today’s interconnected financial landscape, the crypto market is increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors. Here’s a breakdown of potential impacts: Volatility Spike: Economic data releases, especially surprises (either positive or negative compared to expectations), can trigger immediate volatility in all markets, including crypto. Traders should be prepared for potential price swings around these release times. Dollar Strength/Weakness: Strong US economic data often leads to a stronger US dollar. Historically, a stronger dollar can sometimes exert downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices, as Bitcoin and other cryptos are often priced against the dollar. Conversely, dollar weakness can be crypto-positive. Risk Sentiment: Positive economic data can boost overall risk sentiment, which can be beneficial for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, weak data can dampen risk appetite, potentially leading to a flight to safety, away from riskier assets. Interest Rate Expectations: All of this data feeds into expectations about future interest rate hikes or cuts by the Federal Reserve. Higher interest rates can make riskier assets like crypto less attractive compared to safer, yield-bearing assets. Conversely, expectations of lower rates can be crypto-positive. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Here’s how you can navigate this week’s economic events as a crypto trader or investor: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the economic calendar and be aware of the release times mentioned above. Real-time financial news sources can provide live updates and analysis. Manage Risk: Given the potential for volatility, consider adjusting your trading positions or using risk management tools like stop-loss orders. Avoid over-leveraging during periods of high uncertainty. Watch Market Reactions: Observe how the crypto market reacts to each data release. Pay attention to both immediate price movements and the broader trend that emerges. Consider the Bigger Picture: Don’t just react to each data point in isolation. Consider the overall trend and how these data releases might influence the Federal Reserve’s policy and the broader economic outlook. Diversify: Diversification across different asset classes, including and beyond crypto, can help mitigate risk during periods of economic uncertainty. Conclusion: Staying Ahead in the Crypto Game This week’s economic calendar is set to be a significant driver for financial markets , and the cryptocurrency market will undoubtedly feel its ripples. By understanding the significance of these economic events this week and preparing for potential crypto market impact , you can navigate the week with greater confidence and make more informed trading and investment decisions. Remember, in the fast-paced world of crypto, knowledge and preparation are your greatest assets. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and trade wisely!

Banks may now offer crypto and other legally permitted services without obtaining prior regulatory approval. The crypto regulatory environment in the US received a welcomed policy reversal from the FDIC on Friday. Banks can now offer crypto services without prior regulatory approval if they manage the associated risks. Righting Previously “Flawed” Regulatory Approaches The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a Financial Institution Letter (FIL-7-250) on Friday offering new guidance for FDIC-supervised institutions engaged or looking to engage in crypto-related activities. FIL-7-2025 reverses the agency’s 2022 guidelines requiring all FDIC-supervised institutions that intend to engage or are currently involved in crypto-related activities to notify the FDIC. Under the new guidelines, banks may offer digital asset-related services without prior permission from the FDIC. In a press release , the agency clarified: “The guidance affirms that FDIC-supervised institutions may engage in permissible activities, including activities involving new and emerging technologies such as crypto-assets and digital assets, provided that they adequately manage the associated risks.” FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill commented on the policy reversal, explaining the move as part of a new approach to how banks can engage in crypto services according to safety standards. He explained: “With today's action, the FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years.” Adding; ""I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards."" Broader Effort from the Trump Administration The FDIC’s newly issued guidelines come amid the Trump Administration’s concerted effort to allow more effortless engagement with digital assets. Donald Trump emerged as a vocal pro-crypto during the 2024 election and has introduced several reforms to the crypto industry since taking office in January 2025. The President signed an executive order pushing for a Strategic Crypto Reserve and has taken several steps to remove regulatory hurdles in the industry. Under the new administration, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has stepped away from its previous crackdown on crypto and crypto-related companies, which devasted the industry under former Chairman Gary Gensler.

Assessing Musk’s Recent Comments,https://cryptopotato.com/is-this-the-final-chapter-for-dogecoins-bull-run-assessing-musks-recent-comments/,"TL;DR Despite the rumors and speculations that the Musk-led D.O.G.E. might use the meme coin, the billionaire refuted the claims on Sunday evening. While such a statement by Doge’s most famous proponent could hurt the asset, certain technical aspects indicate that there could be some gains around the corner. No DOGE to Be Used During Trump’s presidential campaign last year, one of the groundbreaking promises made by him and people close to him, in this case Elon Musk, was the creation of a government department that would ‘identify and eliminate wasteful government spending, aiming to reduce federal expenditures by $1 trillion.’ Its name, Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), and Musk’s leadership role led to immense excitement in the meme coin community. Moreover, people started speculating that Dogecoin would eventually be used in some form and that it would benefit from the name resemblance. The rumors were fueled by the addition of the meme coin’s logo to the D.O.G.E. website just a day after Trump’s inauguration. All of this hype resulted in a massive rally for Dogecoin, as its price skyrocketed from $0.14 ahead of the elections to a multi-year peak of $0.48 a month later. However, DOGE has failed to maintain its run and has dropped by over 60% since the January peak of $0.42, as it now struggles at $0.163. What could be even worse for DOGE’s upcoming price movements is the fact that Musk refuted the aforementioned rumors on Sunday. Speaking in a Town Hall meeting in Wisconsin, the Tesla CEO said the government has no plans to use DOGE in any form. “They happen to be similar names, but really, we’re literally just trying to make the government 15% more efficient.” The End or Not? Musk’s statement could be regarded as a big blow to Dogecoin’s bull run aspirations, especially since the asset is far from this cycle’s peak. However, there are certain positive signs on the technical side of things, as laid out by Ali Martinez. The analyst noted that the TD Sequential has posted a buy signal on the weekly chart and added that as long as DOGE’s price remains above the lower boundary of the channel posted below, it could reignite another surge. #Dogecoin $DOGE continues to hold above the lower boundary of this channel.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the Ren price from an immediate surge. However, if the Ren price successfully breaks above $0.01174, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.0159. If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Ren price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.008, resulting in a correction to $0.00544. Is Ren a Good Investment? The Ren protocol, formerly known as Republic Protocol, enables interoperability across various blockchains, allowing users to transfer cryptocurrencies seamlessly. Users can lock cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Zcash (ZEC) into the Ren software. In return, they mint equivalent ERC-20 tokens—RenBTC, RenBCH, and RenZEC—on a 1:1 ratio within the Ethereum ecosystem. As REN price is set to surge further, it can be a good investment option in the long run. As with any cryptocurrency investment, conducting thorough research is crucial before investing in REN. Why is the REN Price Down Today? REN price witnessed a bearish reversal as sellers are strongly defending the resistance channels around $0.01. Will REN Price Reach $1? REN price might soon reach the $1 mark in 2035 if the buying demand continues to surge and Ren attracts altcoin investors. Will REN Price Reach $10? Due to the effort of the community, Ren Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the Ren (REN) Coin will reach $10 in the near future, which is a long-term target. Is REN a Good Long-Term Investment? REN has gained popularity thanks to strong community support. However, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research into their long-term potential to determine if it represents a viable long-term investment. REN Price Prediction April 2025 Over the last few days, REN coin price has been on a downward trend and it aims to drop below crucial Fib levels.

Then hacks happen. In some cases, billions vanish overnight. On Feb. 21, 2025, the North Korean Lazarus Group stole $1.46 billion from Bybit . They sent phishing emails to staff with cold wallet access. After compromising these accounts, they accessed Bybit’s interface and replaced the multisignature wallet contract with their malicious version. When Bybit attempted a routine transfer, the hackers redirected 499,000 Ether ( ETH ) to addresses they controlled. This wasn’t just a human error. This was a design failure. A system that allows human factors to enable a billion-dollar theft isn’t innovative — it’s irresponsible. People are not protected In just 10 days, the hackers converted all 499,000 ETH into untraceable funds, using THORChain as their primary channel. The decentralized exchange processed a record $4.66 billion in swaps in a week but implemented no safeguards against suspicious activity. The crypto industry has created a system that cannot protect users even after they discover a theft. Some services actually profited from this crime, collecting millions in fees while processing the laundering of stolen funds. Recent: SafeWallet releases Bybit hack post-mortem report In February 2025, investigators ZachXBT and Tanuki42 revealed that Coinbase users lost over $300 million annually to social engineering attacks. Their report showed $65 million stolen through phishing and other social manipulation techniques in December 2024 and January 2025. According to the investigators, Coinbase failed to address known security vulnerabilities in their API keys and verification systems that make these human-targeted attacks successful. ZachXBT directly criticized the exchange for having “useless customer support agents” and failing to properly report theft addresses to blockchain monitoring tools, making stolen funds harder to track. One scammer even admitted to targeting wealthy users, claiming they make at least five figures a week. These aren’t isolated cases. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that ordinary crypto users lost over $5.6 billion to fraud in 2023 , and social engineering drove at least half of these schemes. Americans alone lose approximately $2 billion–$3 billion annually to human vulnerability attacks. With over 600 million crypto users worldwide, conservative estimates put individual losses from social engineering at $6 billion–$15 billion in 2024. Barrier to adoption Security concerns are now recognized as the main barrier to adoption by 37% of crypto users worldwide. Meanwhile, the industry continues to promote high-risk speculative assets like memecoins, where average users typically lose money while insiders profit. While founders pitch financial freedom, millions of real people lose their savings through vulnerabilities the industry refuses to address. They’re symptoms of a fundamental problem: Crypto builders choose marketing over security. When disasters happen, and they face pressure about security failures, crypto leaders hide behind blockchain’s “code is law” principle and offer philosophical arguments about self-sovereignty and personal responsibility. The crypto industry loves to blame ordinary users: “Don’t store keys online,” “Check addresses before sending,” “Never open suspicious files.” Nobody is safe Even industry leaders themselves fall victim to the same basic attacks. In January 2024, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen lost 283 million XRP ( XRP ) due to storing private keys in an online password manager. DeFiance Capital founder Arthur_0x lost $1.6 million in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrency simply by opening a phishing PDF file. These people aren’t naive beginners — they’re creators and experts of the very system that could not protect even them. They know all the security rules, but the human factor is inevitable. If even the system architects lose millions, what chance do ordinary users have? Knowledge of security rules doesn’t provide complete protection because fever, stress, sleep deprivation or emotional distress severely affect our decision-making abilities. Attackers continuously test different approaches, waiting for moments when users become vulnerable. They evolve their tactics constantly, creating increasingly convincing scenarios, impersonations and urgent situations. The unchangeable nature of blockchain transactions demands extraordinary safeguards — not fewer. If users can’t reverse mistakes or thefts, the system must prevent them in the first place. True innovation means building systems that work for real humans, not theoretically perfect users. Banks learned this lesson over centuries. Crypto builders must learn it faster. Instead, industry leaders seem to have lost touch with reality due to the extreme wealth dumped on them quickly. They’ve bought into their PR narrative, portraying them as geniuses, and started viewing themselves as visionaries. A call to action Vitalik Buterin lectures his audience on voting in elections and polishes his manifesto , while Justin Sun spends $6.2 million on a banana for a “unique artistic experience” — all while building an environment that makes dangerous mistakes easy to make. This approach is fundamentally dishonest. You can’t claim to revolutionize finance while providing less security than the systems you’re replacing. What technical brilliance exists in systems that permit billion-dollar thefts and systematic fraud of ordinary users with such ease? As a core function, true technical excellence would include protecting users from permanent financial loss. A financial system that cannot secure its users’ assets is not technically advanced — it’s fundamentally incomplete. It’s time to stop writing manifestos and promoting questionable PR stunts designed to attract a broader and more vulnerable audience. Start building genuine protections that match the level of risk your users face. No amount of blockchain innovation matters if ordinary people cannot use these systems without fear of instant, permanent financial loss. Anything less is just reckless experimentation at users’ expense disguised as a revolution — a scheme that enriches founders and insiders while ordinary people bear all the risks. If the industry doesn’t solve this problem, regulators will — and you won’t like their solutions. Your philosophical arguments about self-sovereignty won’t matter when licenses are revoked and operations shut down. This is the choice crypto builders face: Either create truly secure systems that justify your claims about financial innovation or watch as regulators transform your “revolutionary technology” into another heavily regulated financial service.

According to a Mar. 31 press release statement , AUSTRAC’s cryptocurrency task force has found signs of suspicious transactions and fraud, raising concerns about the growing number of crypto ATMs. Since December, the task force has been working with businesses to check if they are following AML and counter-terrorism financing rules. AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas issued a warning, saying that although the agency is assisting companies in improving compliance, those who do not adhere to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations will be subject to consequences. “We will continue to work with industry to raise standards, but we will also take action against operators who don’t comply.” — Brendan Thomas, AUSTRAC CEO Australia now has the largest market in the Asia-Pacific region, with about 1,648 cryptocurrency ATMs, compared to just 23 in 2019 and 60 in 2022. There are 348 machines in Sydney alone. Most accept cash deposits for Bitcoin ( BTC ) purchases, which raises the possibility that criminals could use them to transfer illicit funds.

Crypto ATM operators are required to register with AUSTRAC and adhere to AML/CTF regulations, which include transaction monitoring, customer identity verification, and reporting suspicious activity. AUSTRAC has warned that non- compliant companies may be subject to steep fines and has promised to step up enforcement. This crackdown coincides with a slowdown in the global crypto ATM market due to regulatory pressures. Coin ATM Radar’s latest report shows that over 1,000 Bitcoin ATMs were taken out of service globally in February. The overall number has decreased by 2,062 since late 2022. With more than 78% of crypto ATMs in operation, the United States leads the global crypto ATM market, followed by Canada with 9.2%. Australia and Europe each account for just over 4% of the global network.

Which One Of These Is Predicted To 50x By August",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/chainlink-hedera-or-remittix-which-one-of-these-is-predicted-to-50x-by-august/,"In recent Chainlink news and under the eyes of investors tracking the Hedera price closely, analysts are weighing which altcoin, Chainlink, Hedera, or Remittix is likely to climb 50x by August. Chainlink just couldn’t hold on to bull positions, while Hedera is growing slowly. But it’s Remittix that now sees significant investor interest, standing apart in the world of crypto through its utility-oriented model. Let’s take a close look at why Remittix could outperform Chainlink and Hedera when it comes to potential profit and long-term investor returns. Chainlink News: Can LINK Recover After Price Drop? Chainlink news has not been favorable to LINK investors recently. Traded at $13.50, Chainlink is 1.33% down and struggling to gain bullish traction. Chainlink remains a robust player in the DeFi oracle space with a market cap of $8.91 billion. Nevertheless, declining trading volumes, at 13.91% down to $236.85 million, point to weakening investor confidence. Chainlink remains essential to decentralized finance applications. However, poor adoption, high competition, and its recent poor performance are concerns. Experts caution that if Chainlink fails to trigger new investments or forge solid partnerships, its price recovery might still be hindered. Investors are therefore prioritizing more favorable options. While Chainlink languishes in limbo, Remittix is bursting out robustly, promising improved returns. In contrast to Chainlink, Remittix is already experiencing faster adoption and investor interest due to its intentionality and immediate real-world application in cross-border payments, drawing in directly those seeking stability and growth. Hedera Price: Moderate Growth but Restricted Momentum Although Hedera’s price recently saw an uptick of a mere 0.07% to $0.1701, its small increase questions future performance. With a market cap of $7.18 billion, indicating a steady, if uneventful, market standing, Hedera sees its trading volume drop by 17.59%, to $172.29 million, showing abysmal investor interest. Even with its cutting-edge Hashgraph technology, Hedera is in competition with other faster and more affordable blockchain technologies. Skeptics believe that without extensive network growth or major partnerships, Hedera’s development may plateau. Speculators looking for explosive returns are doubtful if Hedera’s price can actually be 50x in the near term. Once again, Remittix is a contrast. With its robust transactional capabilities and immediate utility in the emerging cross-border payments market, Remittix offers investors more defined growth opportunities and is already generating plenty of buzz, precisely where Hedera seems to falter. Why Investors Are Bullish On Remittix As Chainlink falters and Hedera’s price is low-key, Remittix is quickly building investor trust with more than $14.2 million raised so far this year. Priced affordably at $0.0734 with more than 524 million tokens sold, Remittix’s innovative PayFi model speeds international transactions up, reduces costs, and keeps them secure. Consider a Latin American retailer who previously had to withstand the onerous banking fees and slow international payments. With Remittix, these kinds of transactions are instant and very inexpensive, and it is feasible for ordinary global commerce. This real-world use sets Remittix apart from Chainlink’s speculative potential and Hedera’s embryonic system. Analysts predict Remittix could replicate the rapid uptake of previous cross-border tokens like XRP and Stellar and hit 50x returns by August. The current market climate where investors prefer tangible utility over speculation explains Remittix’s uptake and growing popularity Investors Prefer Remittix for Highest Returns While Chainlink news is tepid, and Hedera price rises incrementally only, Remittix shines with immediate investor interest. Its applications in the real world solve real problems, and they fit the market demands perfectly. Investors are more interested in platforms delivering concrete advantages than in fantasy projects. Industry insiders stress that this trend for pragmatic usability strongly favors Remittix over Chainlink and Hedera. For those investors who seek big returns through August, Remittix is clearly the best-positioned among these three promising projects. With a strong adoption plan, strong community support, and strong real-world applications, Remittix appears well-positioned to achieve its goal of explosive growth. Investors looking at these alternatives need to consider the short-term advantages Remittix brings to the crypto community.

His approach emphasizes strategic profit management rather than being swept away by short-term market gains. Pantoja stresses that reaching a seven-figure portfolio does not automatically translate to financial security. Instead, he argues that true financial stability depends on effectively managing the profits generated from an initial investment. He suggests that investors should view themselves as having access to only 10% of their portfolio’s value annually to avoid excessive risk. So, you make $1,000,000 in $XRP $BTC $DOGE $ETH or any other crypto. What's next? How do you turn that one big win into a lifetime of wealth? Here are 4 secrets that helped me: pic.twitter.com/SIzSIqiUwe — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) March 26, 2025 Developing a Strong Investment Plan Pantoja recommends XRP as a foundational asset for building wealth in the cryptocurrency market. However, he warns against over-concentration in a single digital asset. To mitigate risk, he advises diversifying investments across multiple cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, according to him, offers portfolio stability, while Ethereum provides opportunities for passive income through staking. He also highlights the potential of other assets, such as Stellar (XLM), which can contribute to a well-rounded crypto portfolio. Another key recommendation is securing long-term holdings by transferring them to cold storage. Pantoja warns that leaving funds on exchanges exposes investors to security risks, including potential hacks and market volatility. Keeping assets off exchanges minimizes these threats and ensures greater control over investments. Expanding Wealth Through Passive Income Streams Beyond holding digital assets, he further underscores the importance of developing passive income streams. He suggests staking select cryptocurrencies on reputable platforms as a means of earning consistent returns. He also advocates for using cryptocurrency as collateral for loans rather than selling holdings. Borrowing against crypto holdings allows investors to access liquidity while avoiding taxable events that could reduce their overall portfolio value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Pantoja encourages reinvesting borrowed funds into assets that generate steady income, such as dividend-paying stocks, rental properties, farmland, or real estate investment trusts (REITs) . This strategy ensures financial growth without depleting the principal investment. Protecting and Enhancing Financial Gains To safeguard accumulated wealth, Pantoja recommends utilizing tax-efficient structures such as trusts, LLCs, and tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs. These options help investors legally minimize tax obligations while growing their capital. Additionally, he advises those looking to expand their financial security to consider building a business. According to the investor, a well-structured business can generate a reliable monthly income, ranging from $6,000 to $15,000, creating long-term financial sustainability. His final piece of advice is to maintain a disciplined approach to wealth management. He emphasizes that successful investors do not spend their principal but rather generate income from their investments. By adopting this mindset, individuals can transition from making a million dollars to keeping it—and growing it over time.

Here’s What Analysts Say,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoinfinance-outperform-ethereum-in-2025-heres-what-analysts-say/,"Ethereum has long been the foundation of decentralized finance, smart contracts, and blockchain innovation. But a fresh contender is now entering the conversation—MAGACOINFINANCE. While Ethereum fine-tunes scalability and gas efficiency, MAGACOINFINANCE is catching fire in its pre-sale, leading some analysts to question if this underdog could pull off one of 2025’s biggest surprises.

Current Market Insights on ETH, XRP, INJ, and BCH Ethereum (ETH) – Priced at $1,832, Ethereum leads all smart contract platforms but continues to wrestle with scalability and fees despite major upgrades. XRP (Ripple) – At $2.16, XRP’s legal clarity has sparked renewed interest as Ripple’s payment infrastructure gains traction in institutional finance. Injective (INJ) – Trading at $8.95, INJ supports a fast-expanding decentralized trading ecosystem, with cross-chain capabilities and derivatives support. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – Sitting at $306, BCH remains relevant for fast, low-fee peer-to-peer payments, and continues to serve as a practical BTC alternative.

However, the news is still meaningful for the crypto world – it’s just the uncertainty coming out of the White House that’s disabling BTC price from celebrating it fully. Once the macro environment stabilises, it’s believable that the digital asset will resume its upward trajectory, hopefully pulling the rest of the crypto market, including the up-and-coming meme tokens, like Bitcoin Pepe , up with it. Why is GME news significant for Bitcoin Pepe? GameStop’s choice to become an institutional investor of Bitcoin is a significant development since it could improve legitimacy and increase demand for crypto coins. Since the BTC itself is still going for well over $80,000, a huge part of the retail community may find it beyond reach and choose to invest in the likes of Bitcoin Pepe instead, particularly since the meme coins have a history of offering explosive returns in early stages. In fact, that narrative is already showing in Bitcoin Pepe’s ongoing presale, which has raised close to $5.8 million within weeks. If you’re interested in learning more about Bitcoin Pepe and its native crypto coin, click here to visit the project’s website now. The new SEC is committed to crypto regulation Bitcoin Pepe may be an exciting investment for this year also because Paul Atkins, President Donald Trump’s nominee to head the US Securities and Exchange Commission, reiterated crypto regulation as a top priority last week. Atkins pledged to build a “rational, coherent, and principled” framework for cryptocurrencies at his confirmation hearing before the Senate on March 27. His remarks are significant since regulatory uncertainty has long been a headwind for digital assets. Once the Trump administration delivers on its promise of improvement on that front, crypto coins, including the likes of Bitcoin Pepe, could rally in 2025. Visit the website at this link to explore ways to invest in Bitcoin Pepe today. Should you invest in Bitcoin Pepe today? After the presale, devs have plans of listing Bitcoin Pepe on a notable crypto exchange that often drives interest and helps push the price of the token further up. Additionally, the Federal Reserve remains committed to two rate cuts in 2025. As interest rates lower, risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin Pepe, could appear more attractive for investors. All in all, there are several tailwinds, some on the macro level and some Bitcoin Pepe-specific, that indicate potential for significant upside in the platform’s native meme coin.

At the current level, 1 ETH is the equivalent of 0.02191 BTC. That's the least since May 2020, when ether was trading around $200 and bitcoin just under $10,000. Today the ETH price is about $1,800 and the BTC price around $82,000. The underperformance is notable because it's the first time ether has weakened against bitcoin in the 12 months after a BTC reward halving . On April 20, 2024, the payment Bitcoin miners received for confirming blocks on the blockchain was reduced by 50% to 3.125 BTC. In previous halving cycles, ether outperformed bitcoin in the first year after a halving. This time, the ratio has dropped by more than 50%. That's partly because the threat of a tariff-driven trade war, persistent inflation and elevated bonds yields globally have driven investors to assets seen as more liquid and less risky. Gold, the ultimate haven, has climbed to record highs, and in the cryptocurrency market bitcoin is seen as a safer bet than ether. This relative performance also marks one of ether’s worst quarterly performances against bitcoin in several years, according to data from Glassnode. The last time ether underperformed bitcoin to a similar degree was in the third quarter of 2019, when the ratio dropped to 0.0164, a quarterly decline of 46%. This current slump mirrors the underperformance seen in 2019 and further highlights ether's relative weakness, especially when compared to other layer-1 assets . The SOLETH ratio — measuring the value of Solana’s SOL relative to ether — is up 24% year-to-date to 0.07007. This indicates that SOL has significantly outperformed ether in 2025, despite the token itself itself being down 35% year-to-date.

The analyst expressed concerns over influencers promoting unrealistic targets, such as claims that XRP would reach $100 within a month or surge to $10,000 overnight. According to All Things XRP, such projections do not contribute positively to the community and instead foster misleading expectations. The analyst emphasized the need for responsible discourse, stating that the community is becoming increasingly aware of exaggerated claims. According to All Things XRP, many XRP holders are growing frustrated and are looking for leadership grounded in facts rather than sensationalism. The analyst noted a commitment to providing fact-based insights that support the growth of the community and stressed the importance of higher standards in cryptocurrency discussions. Community Response to the Statement X user Michael Halatek responded to All Things XRP’s post by supporting the call for more responsible messaging. Halatek stated that he had made a similar argument, describing it as an issue that needed to be addressed. He referenced an instance where a single XRP influencer posted multiple contradictory price predictions—ranging from $44 to $10,000—within six hours. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to Halatek, such behavior is motivated by financial gain, with influencers seeking engagement for profit rather than providing useful information. He suggested that community administrators should take action against those who engage in misleading speculation, arguing that their content does not offer any real value to XRP holders. The Push for Higher Standards in Crypto Discourse The discussion initiated by All Things XRP highlights an ongoing concern about misinformation within the cryptocurrency space. The analyst’s message calls for a shift toward a more fact-driven approach, asserting that responsible communication is necessary for mainstream adoption. The post suggests that the credibility of the XRP community could be strengthened by moving away from hype-driven narratives and focusing on realistic assessments. While price speculation is a common aspect of cryptocurrency discussions, the response to All Things XRP’s post reflects a sentiment among some XRP holders that exaggerated predictions are causing more harm than good. The push for higher standards in discourse aligns with broader efforts to establish a more informed and trustworthy crypto environment.

Meanwhile, the crypto space is still reeling from the massive $1.4 billion Bybit exchange hack in February, which was orchestrated by North Korea’s Lazarus Group. In parallel, cybersecurity firm Threat Fabric uncovered a new Android malware, Crocodilus, that is designed to steal crypto wallet seed phrases through fake overlay screens and social engineering tactics. SIR.trading Hit by Major Hack The Ethereum-based DeFi protocol SIR.trading, which is also known as Synthetics Implemented Right, suffered a devastating hack that resulted in the complete loss of its total value locked (TVL). The protocol’s TVL amounted to close to $355,000 at the time of the attack. The exploit happened on March 30 and was first flagged by blockchain security firms TenArmorAlert and Decurity , both of which issued warnings on social media to alert the community. After the incident, the protocol’s pseudonymous founder, Xatarrer, described the hack as ”the worst news a protocol could receive” but expressed hope that the team will try to keep the project alive despite the severe setback. According to Decurity’s analysis, the attack was executed through a sophisticated manipulation of a callback function in SIR.trading’s vulnerable Vault contract. This function relied on Ethereum's transient storage feature that was introduced in last year’s Dencun upgrade. The attacker was able to exploit this feature by substituting the real Uniswap pool address used in the callback with an address they controlled. This made it possible for them to siphon the protocol's funds into their own wallet. Blockchain security firm TenArmorAlert explained that the attacker repeatedly triggered this callback function to fully drain the vault’s assets. SupLabsYi , a researcher from security firm Supremacy, offered some more technical details into the hack, and stated that it may point to an emerging security flaw in Ethereum’s transient storage mechanism. This feature was designed to allow for cheaper, temporary data storage, reducing gas fees, but it is still relatively new and untested at scale. The attack on SIR.trading is one of the first known exploits targeting its potential vulnerabilities. After the exploit, TenArmorAlert reported that the stolen funds were moved to an address funded via Ethereum’s privacy solution Railgun. SIR.trading’s founder has since reached out to Railgun in an effort to track or recover the stolen assets. The protocol prided itself in being a safer alternative for leveraged trading, and previously disclosed in its documentation that despite audits, its smart contracts could contain undetected bugs. It specifically pointed to the vault mechanisms as a potential area of vulnerability due to their complex logic. Crypto’s Biggest Hack Other exploits also recently turned heads in the crypto space. It seems like North Korea-affiliated hackers scaled back their operations during the second half of 2024 while preparing for what would become the largest crypto hack in history. The industry was shaken on Feb. 21 when the Lazarus Group, which is a notorious hacking collective linked to North Korea, orchestrated a sophisticated attack on the crypto exchange Bybit. This attack resulted in the theft of more than $1.4 billion. According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis , illicit activity tied to North Korean cyber actors declined after July 1 of 2024, despite a surge in attacks earlier that year. Eric Jardine, Chainalysis’ cybercrimes research lead, suggested that this slowdown coincided with geopolitical developments, particularly the summit between Russia and North Korea. This meeting reportedly led to the reallocation of North Korean resources, including military personnel, to help in Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. Jardine speculated that this shift may have also allowed the Lazarus Group to regroup, select new targets, and prepare for the massive Bybit attack. (Source: Chainlaysis ) The attack was executed with precision, and the hackers were able to launder the stolen funds through the decentralized cross-chain protocol THORChain within just ten days. Despite this, blockchain security experts were still optimistic that at least a portion of the funds could still be recovered. The Bybit hack shed some light on the vulnerability of even the most secure centralized exchanges to highly sophisticated cyberattacks. Analysts noticed that the incident had similarities to other major hacks, like the $230 million attack on WazirX and the $58 million exploit on Radiant Capital. Meir Dolev, co-founder and CTO of blockchain security firm Cyvers, explained that the attackers compromised an Ethereum multisig cold wallet by tricking signers into unknowingly approving a change to the smart contract’s logic. This deceptive transaction allowed the hackers to seize control of the wallet and drain its contents. North Korea hacking activity (Source: Chainalysis ) Throughout 2024 , North Korean hackers were responsible for stealing more than $1.34 billion worth of digital assets across 47 separate incidents, according to Chainalysis. This was a 102% increase from the $660 million that was stolen in 2023 and accounted for an alarming 61% of all crypto stolen globally last year. Crocodilus Malware Targets Crypto Wallets Exploits are not the only danger threatening crypto users and their funds. Cybersecurity firm Threat Fabric recently uncovered a new and highly sophisticated malware targeting Android users, and it is specifically designed to steal cryptocurrency seed phrases and take over devices. The malware is called Crocodilus, and it employs fake overlay screens to deceive users into revealing sensitive information, including the recovery phrases of their crypto wallets. In a report that was published on March 28, Threat Fabric analysts shared details about how Crocodilus manipulates victims by displaying a warning message urging them to back up their wallet key in a specific time frame, typically 12 hours, or risk losing access to their funds. This social engineering tactic leads users to their seed phrase, which the malware then captures using its accessibility logger. Once the seed phrase is obtained, the attackers gain full control over the victim's wallet and can drain its contents. Crocodilus not only targets crypto wallets but also possesses the advanced capabilities of modern banking malware. It can harvest data through screen captures, launch fake overlay attacks, and remotely control infected devices. The infection typically occurs when users inadvertently download software embedded with the malware, which bypasses Android 13's built-in security protections. Example of the overlays used (Source: Threat Fabric ) After installation, Crocodilus prompts users to enable accessibility services, which is a request that allows the malware to communicate with its command-and-control server. This connection enables it to receive instructions, including which applications to target and which overlays to use. The malware runs continuously in the background, monitoring app activity and launching overlays when targeted apps, particularly banking or crypto apps, are opened. During this process, it can mute the device's sound and operate without the user's knowledge. Threat Fabric’s research indicates that Crocodilus primarily targeted users in Turkey and Spain so far, but the firm warned that the scope of the attack is likely to expand. Analysts also pointed out indications in the malware's code suggesting the developers may speak Turkish and speculated that the threat actor known as Sybra could be involved.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|ETH|ASIA|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-31 09:13:57

In a new video, the analyst uses global M2 money supply – which measures the amount of money flowing throughout the financial system – to forecast potential price targets for Bitcon on the premise that newly created money supply could partially flow into BTC. InvestAnswers says that the most reasonable expectation is that about 0.5% of the newly created supply would flow into Bitcoin, which, according to his models, would bump the price to roughly $115,000. “Bitcoins in circulation are 15 million, remember five million are lost and the current Bitcoin market cap is $1.637 trillion, the new Bitcoin price would go to $146,000, if one percent of this new level of assets goes into Bitcoin. I don’t believe it’s going to be that high, I think it could more along the lines of half of one percent or a quarter of one percent. It depends on adoption, it depends on nation-state game theory. Maybe there’s a nation that’s going to be printing some of their fiat and buying Bitcoin, then you could throw this table away, it’s going to be a lot higher if that’s the case. Because the first nation-state to print money to buy Bitcoin wins. That’s it. So imagine if just half of one percent of the new global M2 goes into Bitcoin – [which is] reasonable, perhaps – the price would go to $115,000. That would increase the price by 37.58% – which a lot of people are groaning and saying ‘$115,000, that’s no good, I want a million dollars’ – well, that’s not the way markets work. There are still a lot of people out there predicting a half-million-dollar Bitcoin by the end of the year. I don’t believe in that. $250,000, I don’t believe in that. $120,000? Maybe, if things really kick off in game theory… My target was always like $119,000, $120,000 for the longest time, going back to 2023. We’ll see if we get there.” Source: InvestAnswers/YouTube At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $82,100.

Known as SIR.trading, the protocol lost around $355,000 in the 30 March attack, with DeFiLlama data confirming its TVL has since dropped to zero. SIR.trading had positioned itself as “a new DeFi protocol for safer leverage,” with the goal of reducing risks like volatility decay and liquidation. How was SIR.trading exploited? Blockchain security firm Decurity called the incident a “clever attack” that exploited a vulnerability in the protocol’s vault contract. The issue was tied to the uniswapV3SwapCallback function, which leverages Ethereum’s transient storage, a new feature introduced in last year’s Dencun upgrade. According to the firm, the attacker managed to replace the legitimate Uniswap pool address in this callback function with their own, allowing them to redirect the vault’s funds. The vault’s logic didn’t properly validate the callback source, and the use of transient storage let the attacker manipulate temporary data mid-transaction. By repeatedly calling the vulnerable function, they were able to drain all assets from the vault. In a separate post-incident commentary, blockchain researcher SupLabsYi of Supremacy highlighted that the attack may have exposed a broader issue with Ethereum’s transient storage itself. He explained that transient storage only resets after the transaction ends, allowing the attacker to overwrite critical security data before the function finishes executing, adding: What’s striking is that transient storage, introduced via EIP-1153 in the Dencun hard fork , is still a nascent feature. This may be one of the first real-world attacks exploiting its vulnerabilities and may signal further changes in attack trends. In this case, the attacker was able to brute-force a vanity address to make the fake pool look legitimate and used a custom contract to complete the exploit. TenArmor, another blockchain research firm and one of the first to flag the incident on X, added that the stolen funds were quickly transferred into an address funded through the Ethereum privacy platform Railgun. The project’s founder, who identifies as Xatarrer, has reached out to Railgun for assistance. In an earlier message to the community, Xatarrer described the exploit as “the worst news a protocol could receive,” but said they were open to rebuilding and called for feedback on next steps. DeFi exploits remain a consistent threat As DeFi continues to innovate, so do the tactics of attackers, with SIR.trading now joining a roster of exploited protocols in recent weeks. On March 19, Four.Meme, a BNB Chain-based memecoin launch platform, suspended its token launch feature after a critical vulnerability in one of the protocol’s functions allowed an attacker to manipulate the platform’s smart contract. Prior to this attack, Four.Meme suffered another attack on February 11, which also led to the temporary suspension of its token liquidity pool on PancakeSwap. During the same month, decentralised lending protocol zkLend was drained of over $9 million following what the developers described as an empty market exploit. According to a January report from web3 security firm PeckShield, in 2024, defi protocols were the most targeted. Crypto investors lost $3.01 billion, making a roughly 15% increase from the previous year.

Binance has introduced a new feature allowing users to trade directly from their centralized exchange (CEX) wallets to decentralized exchanges (DEX), aiming to simplify the user experience and bridge the gap between CEX and DeFi platforms. Meanwhile, Uniswap, one of the largest decentralized exchanges, is facing a noticeable decline in visibility and user engagement, with its US App Store ranking and trading activity dropping significantly in recent months. Binance Launches Seamless CEX-to-DEX Trading in Push to Simplify Crypto Experience Binance , the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has launched a groundbreaking feature that allows users to trade directly from its centralized exchange (CEX) to decentralized exchanges (DEX), marking a significant step forward in addressing crypto's long-standing user experience barriers. The new integration enables Binance customers to utilize funds stored in their CEX wallets to execute trades on leading DEX platforms without the need for manual asset bridging, wallet switching, or cumbersome token transfers — processes that have historically deterred many newcomers from engaging with decentralized finance (DeFi). In an official announcement, Binance revealed that the new CEX-to-DEX trade feature supports transactions across multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, Base, and BNB Smart Chain. Users can now use USDC — Circle’s dollar-pegged stablecoin — and other supported stablecoins directly from their Binance accounts to acquire tokens available on DEXs in these ecosystems. Binance stated that this feature is fully integrated with other key services on its platform, including Binance Alpha, which gives users early access to emerging tokens, and the Binance Quick Buy tool, which simplifies the purchase of digital assets. By eliminating the need for asset bridging, which typically involves transferring tokens from one blockchain to another via third-party protocols, Binance’s new offering seeks to reduce the technical complexity and security risks associated with interacting with DeFi platforms. This move by Binance directly targets one of the crypto industry’s most significant hurdles: the complicated and often intimidating user experience. Crypto has long been plagued by complex user interfaces, confusing wallet setups, and fragmented liquidity across different blockchains. These challenges have frequently prevented mainstream users from interacting with decentralized finance protocols and fully participating in the broader Web3 economy. An online meme circulating in crypto communities pokes fun at this very issue, likening the multi-step process of interacting with DeFi platforms to ”solving a Rubik's Cube blindfolded.” Binance’s latest initiative attempts to remove that blindfold. The feature aligns with broader efforts across the crypto industry to streamline user experiences and make DeFi more accessible. In November 2024, the WalletConnect Foundation and Reown introduced a standard framework for crypto wallets to simplify wallet interactions and reduce transactional friction. Pedro Gomes, director of the WalletConnect Foundation, explained at the time that the framework was focused on ”minimizing clicks, reducing transaction friction, improving interoperability, and providing clear and accessible information.” Industry leaders like Anurag Arjun, co-founder of Avail and the Polygon Layer-2 network, have also pointed out that blockchain abstraction techniques have contributed to fragmentation across ecosystems. Arjun emphasized that bridging assets across networks is not only cumbersome but also introduces unnecessary risks and confusion for users. Similarly, Sandeep Nailwal, who co-founded Polygon alongside Arjun, recently likened the current state of the crypto space to the internet of the late 1990s — an era defined by clunky interfaces and limited accessibility. Nailwal argued that smoother onboarding, better custody solutions, and wallet recovery options are essential for crypto’s mass adoption. A Step Toward Mass Adoption By allowing direct CEX-to-DEX trading, Binance is attempting to answer these concerns and lower the entry barrier for millions of potential users who want to explore decentralized platforms but are discouraged by technical obstacles. The exchange believes that bridging the gap between centralized and decentralized finance is a critical step toward broader crypto adoption. Binance’s new feature aims to create a Web2-like experience in a Web3 world, providing users with the flexibility of decentralized finance without sacrificing the security and simplicity of centralized custody. Binance’s new initiative could set the stage for a new trend where major centralized platforms help onboard retail users into the DeFi ecosystem without the steep learning curve. It could also trigger further competition among exchanges to offer more user-friendly, interoperable services that remove complexity from crypto trading. Moreover, this approach addresses growing regulatory concerns about user protection and security in DeFi by allowing users to interact with decentralized ecosystems without exposing themselves to unnecessary bridging risks. Uniswap’s US App Store Ranking Crashes to Historic Lows Amid Trading Volume Decline Meanwhile, Uniswap, the world’s leading decentralized exchange (DEX), is facing a concerning downtrend in its visibility and user engagement, as evidenced by its dramatic fall in the US App Store rankings. Once riding high on the back of post-election crypto enthusiasm, Uniswap’s finance category ranking has plummeted to levels not seen since its early days, reflecting a deeper decline in both user activity and trading volume. In the aftermath of the 2024 US presidential election, Uniswap's app store ranking experienced a significant boost. Following the surprise victory of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump, Uniswap jumped from its usual spot in the 190s to the 110s in the finance category of the US App Store. The positive sentiment surrounding Trump's inauguration in January 2025 propelled Uniswap’s app to its highest recorded ranking in recent memory — peaking at rank 99. However, this spike proved to be short-lived. Over the past two months, Uniswap’s app store position has deteriorated rapidly, falling to rank 364, a dramatic drop that not only erased its post-election gains but also pushed it to its lowest ranking in recent history. While many crypto-related apps experienced temporary increases in popularity following the pro-crypto election victory, most of them eventually reverted to their pre-election standings. Uniswap, however, is an outlier, with its ranking falling well below historic norms, suggesting more than just the fading of election-related hype. The declining App Store ranking appears to be a symptom of a broader slowdown in Uniswap’s ecosystem. Since the start of 2025, Uniswap’s trader activity on the Ethereum network has suffered a sharp decline. The number of unique traders has fallen by over 45%, from 69,680 at the beginning of January to around 37,000 in March — a level not seen since July 2023. This exodus of users has been mirrored in trading volume as well. Uniswap recorded a 10% drop in trading volume from December 2024 to January 2025. This decline steepened further with a 22% month-over-month drop from January to February. Early data for March suggests that the downtrend is continuing. With just days left in the month, Uniswap’s trading volume is currently barely surpassing half of February’s total, setting the stage for potentially its worst monthly performance in nearly two years. What’s Behind Uniswap’s Decline? Several factors may be contributing to Uniswap’s struggles. While the brief election-fueled optimism initially drove user engagement, the crypto market has since cooled as regulatory uncertainty and economic concerns returned to the forefront. Uniswap's decentralized model, while celebrated by crypto purists, has also been at odds with the growing demand for more streamlined and user-friendly experiences offered by centralized platforms. Additionally, Uniswap continues to face intense competition from both emerging decentralized exchanges and established centralized players who are increasingly integrating DeFi services into their platforms. Binance’s recent rollout of CEX-to-DEX trading integration, for example, offers an easier onboarding process for retail users looking to explore decentralized markets — a market segment where Uniswap has historically struggled to compete. The decline in Uniswap’s app store ranking may also signal waning interest from casual retail investors, many of whom were drawn to crypto during the 2021 bull run but have since exited the market amid prolonged volatility and lackluster price performance in the DeFi sector. For Uniswap, the steep fall in user activity and app visibility raises urgent questions about its ability to maintain relevance and competitiveness in a rapidly evolving crypto landscape. The DEX pioneered the concept of automated market making (AMM) and decentralized liquidity pools, but these innovations alone may no longer be enough to attract and retain users amid shifting market dynamics and evolving user expectations. With March’s trading data poised to mark another month of contraction, the pressure is now on Uniswap’s development team and community to address the platform’s sliding momentum. Whether through product innovation, user experience enhancements, or renewed marketing efforts, Uniswap may need to reimagine how it engages with a broader audience if it hopes to reverse its current trajectory.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|UNI|BNB|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-31 09:30:00

According to Cointelegraph, former U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed 25% tariffs and shifting expectations regarding Federal Reserve interest rate cuts have rattled risk traders, intensifying bearish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. Trump’s Tariff Plans and Market Reaction The cryptocurrency market, particularly risk-sensitive assets like XRP, has been under pressure following reports that Trump, if re-elected, intends to impose 25% tariffs on imports from China and other trading partners. UPDATE: $XRP price could drop another 40% as President Trump’s 25% tariffs and falling rate cut odds spook risk traders. pic.twitter.com/YsKe4k1ilE — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 31, 2025 Historically, trade tariffs lead to market instability, increasing the cost of goods and services, while simultaneously reducing economic growth. For risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies, such policies create an atmosphere of uncertainty, prompting investors to move toward safer assets such as gold, bonds, and the U.S. dollar. With XRP already experiencing volatility, traders now fear that a potential trade war scenario under Trump could dampen investor sentiment further, leading to an extended period of price declines. The Federal Reserve’s Role in XRP’s Outlook Another key factor weighing on XRP’s price trajectory is the diminishing likelihood of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2024. Lower interest rates typically boost risk assets, as they make borrowing cheaper and increase liquidity in financial markets. However, if inflation remains stubbornly high, the Fed may delay or reduce the number of expected rate cuts, leading to lower demand for risk assets like XRP and other cryptocurrencies. Recent macroeconomic data suggests that the Fed may hold off on rate cuts longer than expected, reinforcing bearish pressure on the crypto market. Combined with Trump’s potential trade policies, this could contribute to further downward movement for XRP. XRP’s Technical Setup: More Losses Ahead? From a technical perspective, XRP’s price action is showing signs of weakness . The coin has already struggled to maintain key support levels, and analysts warn that a further 40% drop could materialize if market conditions worsen. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Support Levels to Watch: XRP is currently testing critical support levels, and a break below these zones could accelerate selling pressure. If the coin fails to hold its recent lows, traders may expect a further move toward lower psychological levels. Investor Sentiment Remains Bearish: The combination of macroeconomic uncertainty, Trump’s trade policy risks, and weaker liquidity conditions suggests that buyers are hesitant to step in at current prices. This could lead to further downside pressure in the coming weeks. What’s Next for XRP? While short-term sentiment remains bearish, long-term investors may see any deep correction as a buying opportunity. Historically, XRP has recovered from major downturns, often rebounding when market conditions stabilize. However, in the immediate future, risk traders are closely watching both Trump’s policy developments and the Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates. Any unexpected changes in these areas could further impact XRP’s trajectory. For now, investors should remain cautious, as volatility remains high, and downside risks persist.

Whales offloaded 1.12 billion $XRP in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/DlxE1v1NI5 — Ali (@ali_charts) March 30, 2025 For additional context, at present, XRP whales continue to hold roughly 8.88 billion tokens, down from 10 billion before the latest round of liquidations. This latest development presents quite a bearish signal all on its own. Similar large-scale sell-offs have previously signalled either the beginning of wide-scale profit-taking or major shifts in investor sentiment. However, this time around, the liquidations could have an even more impactful effect on the cryptocurrency’s shorter-term price action — and it’s due to timing. Per Ripple’s escrow schedule, 1 billion XRP tokens will be unlocked on April 1 . Since the start of the year, Ripple has sold more than 900 million tokens through three equal transactions, valued at a grand total of $2.1 billion. In conjunction with the whale sell-off, a similar move could serve to push XRP prices further to the downside. Will the whale sell-off cause XRP prices to drop? At press time on March 31, XRP was changing hands at a price of $2.07, having marked a 15.59% drop in the last seven days. Quite notably, the decline in price happened on strong volume, indicating that significant selling pressure is present. XRP price 1-week chart. Source: CoinMarketCap While XRP did lose $7 billion in market capitalization over the course of the two days in which whales went on a selling spree, readers should note that this was part of a broader market pullback . So, what now? The $2 mark represents both a psychologically significant level as well as key technical support. Most technical analysts remain bullish regarding the token’s long-term prospects , but near-term price action is in a much more precarious position Veteran trader Peter Brandt is one of the few analysts who sees further losses in the cards — projecting a drop to levels as low as $1 , according to a recently spotted head and shoulders pattern . In addition, once the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally signs off on lifting the injunction that prevents the sale of XRP to institutional investors, market sentiments might very well change. Once all is said and done, however, unless market-wide sentiments see a dramatic shift in short order, XRP will most likely fall below $2 — although it remains to be seen whether the drop will continue or if a strong level of demand will be established at that price.

While Bitcoin (BTC) struggles to gain momentum, savvy investors are turning their attention elsewhere. A few standout altcoins are already catching attention. Toncoin (TON), FloppyPepe (FPPE) , and Cardano (ADA) are making waves, and for good reason. These three might be worth watching for investors looking for the next big opportunity after the US Bitcoin Reserve. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Best Altcoin To Buy After The US Bitcoin Reserve Announcement Investors are no longer chasing hype; they want real-value crypto projects. Many altcoins have surged in price only to fizzle out due to a lack of sustainability. But with AI taking over the market, newer tokens are rewriting the game. FloppyPepe (FPPE) isn’t just riding the trend; it’s surpassing projects that came before it. The real question is: Why should investors pay attention in 2025, even after the US Bitcoin Reserve? The tokenomics is built for long-term growth, regardless of market conditions. While most projects create excessive tokens and rely on occasional burns to control liquidity, FloppyPepe (FPPE) takes a smarter approach, automatically burning 1% of every transaction. This creates a constantly shrinking supply, driving scarcity and value. Beyond that, demand is exploding. The community’s excitement has fueled a rush to grab the limited tokens, and once they’re gone, prices could skyrocket. But the benefits don’t stop there; holders earn passive rewards, too, with another 1% of every transaction redistributed back to them. So, what's powering this project? FloppyAI. This advanced AI transforms how investors interact with crypto. It processes real-time market data , user queries, and on-chain insights through machine learning, offering instant alerts, trade execution, and continuous adaptation to market trends. But the real magic? Two AI-driven meme creators: Meme-O-Matic and FloppyX. FloppyX makes video creation easy and delivers high-quality and relevant video content. Meanwhile, Meme-O-Matic takes even the simplest ideas and turns them into viral sensations, dominating the internet. These two tools are available on Telegram, X, and the FloppyPepe (FPPE) website. FloppyPepe (FPPE) goes the extra mile to solidify its credibility by securing a security audit from Solidproof . Toncoin (TON) Since the release of Durov, Toncoin (TON) has seen consistent price movements. This surge in investors’ confidence has driven the Toncoin price from $2.39 to $3.79, marking an impressive 58% increase this month. Recently, the TON Foundation announced that leading U.S.-based venture capital firms have invested over $400 million in Toncoin (TON), signaling strong institutional confidence. Additionally, native accounts surged to 41M, while Toncoin (TON) holders have surpassed $121M. This rapid adoption highlights the increasing adoption of Toncoin (TON) even as the US Bitcoin Reserve has failed to pump the BTC price higher. Cardano (ADA) Cardano’s price movement is influenced by technological advancements, network upgrades, and smart contract adoptions. While the US Bitcoin Reserve announcement has failed to lift Bitcoin’s price, Cardano (ADA) has defied the trend, gaining momentum as whale investors accumulate millions of Cardano (ADA) tokens. Adding to the bullish sentiment, crypto analyst Ali recently highlighted on X that Cardano (ADA) had received a buy signal from the TD Sequential indicator on the 4-hour chart. This technical setup suggests that a rebound could be imminent, fueling optimism among traders and investors who see Cardano (ADA) as an altcoin to buy in 2025. Looking Ahead After the US Bitcoin Reserve announcement, analysts are pointing to the upcoming altcoin season. But the real question isn’t just when; it’s which altcoins are worth betting on. Toncoin (TON) and Cardano (ADA) have strong momentum, but when it comes to real utility, which is the main driving force of any coin, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out to deliver the most. With a rapidly growing community and solid fundamentals, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioned to outshine other altcoins in the market. But knowing is only half the battle; timing matters, and those who move early often see the greatest rewards. The token is already out for $0.0000002, marking the beginning of what could be a major breakout.

42690248,https://timestabloid.com/?p=62328,1743413786,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions Explained: Beginner’s Guide,https://timestabloid.com/ethereum-layer-2-solutions-explained-beginners-guide/,"Ethereum introduced smart contracts and dApps in the blockchain ecosystem, and it’s been the leading player in this field. But, as adoption grew, it was clear that Ethereum couldn’t handle as many transactions as it needed with its throughput of around 14 transactions per second. During higher demand, gas fees rose, and settlement times became increasingly long. There are many improvement proposals, and developers introduced a series of upgrades to solve this issue. However, the current consensus is that Layer-2 protocols are the solution to Ethereum’s scalability problem. If you want to swap BTC to ETH and participate in the Ethereum ecosystem, you should learn about Layer-2 solutions. Layer-2 projects operate as a second blockchain on top of Ethereum. They process transactions off-chain and then settle the final result on the main chain. This improves transaction times and costs but maintains Ethereum’s security and decentralization. Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions: Types and Overview Layer 2 is an umbrella term to encompass different technologies, including rollups, sidechains, or state channels. Layer 2 helps scale Ethereum by loading off transaction processing from the main chain while maintaining its security infrastructure. Rollups bundle transactions to process them off-chain and add the resulting data to Ethereum. Rollups can be zero-knowledge or optimistic, depending on how to approach verification. State channels allow the parties involved to deposit the funds in a smart contract, and they can make as many transactions as they want on it. Only the final result is settled on the main chain. Funds are locked in a multisig smart contract. Plasma chains act as child chains from Ethereum. They can be customized to serve specific purposes, like for businesses or communities. Settlement on the main network takes a few days, to avoid the risk of fake transactions. Validium ensures transaction validity with ZK proofs keeping data on-chain. Ethereum Layer-2 vs. Layer-1: What’s the Difference? To understand Layer-2 solutions, it’s important to learn what sets them apart from Layer-1. Simply put, Layer-1 refers to the main Ethereum chain we all know and use. With the rise of NFT and DeFi, the network struggled with congestion. ETH ETF is now putting more buying pressure on Ethereum, although ETF traders don’t interact directly with the token. Layer-2 protocols run on top of this main chain and benefit from Ethereum’s security and decentralization (because transactions are ultimately settled there). However, since they don’t operate directly on Ethereum, Layer-2 chains are not bound by its limitations. Therefore, they can process more transactions per second, lowering time to finality and fees. Top 3 Benefits of Using Ethereum Layer-2 Most Ethereum developers agree that instead of upgrading the main chain to achieve higher throughput, it’s best to operate Layer-2 chains to scale Ethereum. There are many available options, and core Ethereum developers believe this can benefit scalability as a whole. The more alternatives in the market, the more options for traders and dApps. In the end, the different Layer-2 chains serve the myriad of DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces that keep processing thousands of transactions daily. Let’s expand more on the benefits of using Layer-2 solutions. Lower Transaction Fees On the main chain, transaction fees are around $1. Sometimes, when demand increases, it can go over $10. Some Layer-2 chains offer fees as low as $0.04-$0.15. This still represents 85% less than the average Ethereum transaction. While other Ethereum alternatives feature much lower fees, it usually comes at the risk of centralization or network stability. Networks can’t achieve scalability, security, and decentralization at the same time — the so-called blockchain Trilemma. In all cases, projects must sacrifice one of these aspects. For Ethereum developers, while this chain sacrifices scalability, it solves the problem with Layer-2. Faster Transactions In DeFi protocols, and trading in general, timing is key. A couple of seconds can make the difference between a good trade and a great one. The main Ethereum chain takes around 15 seconds to validate transactions. Layer-2 chains can reach near-instant transaction times. Settlement on the main chain, of course, can take days, but it will not affect your balance if all transactions are legitimate. Considering there are over $47 billion locked in DeFi smart contracts in Ethereum, it’s clear that we need solutions to provide instant transactions and higher throughputs. https://www.pexels.com/es-es/foto/moneda-en-mano-del-mercado-de-valores-de-criptomonedas-31220975/ Increased Scalability The scalability is, along with transaction speed, a crucial feature for DeFi and NFT marketplaces. Layer-2 solutions offer varying throughput values, depending on the particular characteristics of each. But in general, they can process over 1,000 tps. Arbitrum, an Optimistic Rollup, can process up to 40 thousand tps, with average fees of around 2 cents. ImmutableX, a rollup using the ZK model, can process around 9 thousand tps. This throughput is achieved without compromising security or decentralization because all transactions are ultimately settled on the Ethereum blockchain. Investing in Ethereum: What Beginners Should Know If you’re new to the Ethereum ecosystem, so many chains and protocols can scare you away. However, the different Layer-2 solutions are worth exploring to understand their values and risks. This sector of blockchain is still evolving, and as a new investor, it can be profitable to learn the most reputable Layer-2 projects. After you buy Ethereum , these other tokens and chains can be worthy additions to your portfolio as long as you acknowledge their pros and cons.

Scams such as address poisoning and wallet spoofing involve tricking victims into sending assets to fraudulent wallet addresses that closely resemble legitimate ones. According to blockchain investigator ZachXBT, multiple Coinbase-linked wallets have been targeted this month. A screenshot from blockchain explorer Blockchair shows a suspected 400 Bitcoin ( BTC ) theft from a single wallet address. “It is suspected a Coinbase user was scammed yesterday for $34.9M (400.099 BTC),” the investigator wrote in a March 28 Telegram post . “After uncovering this theft I noticed multiple other suspected thefts from Coinbase users in the past two weeks bringing the total stolen this month to $46M+,” he added. Suspected 400 BTC phishing theft victim. Source: Blockchair “We are aware of ZachXTB’s claims and are investigating,” Jaclyn Sales, director of communications at Coinbase, told Cointelegraph, adding: “Coinbase will never call you or ask for your login credentials, API key or two-factor authentication codes. We will also never ask you to transfer funds.” “If someone contacts you claiming to be from Coinbase and requests this information or asks you to transfer assets, do not do it. It is a scam,” she said.

Elliot Chun, a partner at the tech-focused advisory firm Architect Partners, made this bold forecast in a March 28 blog post , citing increasing pressure on treasury managers to explore Bitcoin or risk being seen as outdated. “If you tried it and it worked, you’re a genius. If you tried it and it didn’t work, you at least tried. But if you didn’t try and have no good reason, your job may be at risk,” Chun explained, highlighting the growing sentiment among corporate finance leaders. At present, only two S&P 500 companies—Tesla and Block—hold BTC on their balance sheets. To meet Chun’s projection, at least 123 additional S&P 500 firms would need to follow suit by 2030. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy (MSTR), although not part of the S&P 500, continues to dominate as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with its aggressive BTC acquisition strategy driving its stock price up over 2,000% since its first BTC purchase in August 2020. This performance far outpaces both Bitcoin itself, which surged 781.1% during the same period, and the S&P 500, which gained 64.8%. FOMO’ed Treasury Managers The potential upside of holding BTC is adding pressure on treasury managers to at least consider the asset. Industry heavyweights like ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz have predicted that Bitcoin could soar to $500,000 or even $1 million by 2030, making the case for early adoption increasingly compelling. Firms embracing BTC as part of their treasury strategy have also seen a boost in market value. GameStop recently hinted at joining the Bitcoin club, following its $1.3 billion convertible notes offering on March 26, with plans to use part of the funds to buy BTC. Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset Remains Unproven While the strategy is gaining popularity, Chun warned that firms aiming to replicate MicroStrategy’s success could be setting themselves up for disappointment. MSTR’s performance, he noted, was unique due to its early-mover advantage when U.S. asset managers lacked direct exposure to Bitcoin. Still, Chun argued that BTC offers more flexibility as a treasury asset compared to gold. Being digitally transferable and liquid, BTC eliminates the logistical challenges of storing and moving physical assets. The trend has also spurred new financial products, such as the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF , launched earlier this month, which tracks companies with at least 1,000 BTC in their corporate treasuries.

The survey, which polled 5,863 adults over three weeks, also found that uncertainty still remains high. Across all three surveys, at least 40% of respondents indicated uncertainty in holding cryptocurrencies in the future, the HKUST research team stated. At the same time, despite the FTX collapse in November 2022, more respondents still expressed confidence in using regulated exchanges.

While more Hongkongers expressed their interest in buying cryptocurrencies, public understanding of tokenized money appears limited as 72% of respondents said they were unfamiliar with central bank digital currency, followed by 65% for e-HKD, 61% for stablecoins, and 81% for tokenized deposits, the survey showed. Hong Kong has made strides to advance itself into a crypto hub, namely through issuing licenses to crypto exchanges and made it possible for companies to issue tokenized investment products. In August 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched a sandbox initiative dubbed “Project Ensemble Sandbox” that is designed to test and refine the use of tokenized money for interbank settlements and transactions involving tokenized assets.

The initiative aims to make American Bitcoin a dominant force in the cryptocurrency mining industry. American Bitcoin was founded with contributions from ASIC miners from Hut 8 in exchange for a majority stake in American Data Centers, a company founded by investors such as Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. The company has since rebranded as American Bitcoin. Under the new structure, all Bitcoin mining operations that were previously part of Hut 8’s IT segment will continue under the American Bitcoin brand. However, these activities will still be reported in Hut 8’s financial statements. Hut 8 will remain the exclusive infrastructure and operations partner for American Bitcoin and will provide stable revenue streams through long-term agreements.

But simply buying Bitcoin is only half the story. Mining it in favorable economic conditions presents a much greater opportunity. We are excited to bring this thesis to life and bring investors into the equation through a platform designed to provide real, tangible participation in Bitcoin’s growth.” *This is not investment advice.

Could this downturn take on a snowball effect and lead to a much more serious crash? Stock market and crypto market in fear Market sentiment is plumbing the bottom over recent weeks. In traditional markets Fear and Greed has dipped into ‘Extreme Fear’ as the S&P 500 fell through major support on Friday, down a huge 2% for the day. In the crypto market things are similar, as the dial in the Fear and Greed Index hovers at a ‘Fear’ reading of 34. With seemingly no end to the Trump strategy of slapping tariffs on friend and foe alike, the markets are just not able to predict what is going to happen as 2025 unfolds, and with uncertainty being the worst possible outlook for markets, the stock market is acting accordingly. S&P 500 falls through support Source: TradingView After looking as though it might have found a bottom at the $5,635 level, the S&P 500 dipped down through this level on Friday, reaching $5,580. With a new weekly candle about to open below the support, this stock market could now fall to the low $5,000 region, and even face the possibility of going all the way back to the $4,800 high set in January 2022. That said, the Stochastic RSI is right at the bottom, and this will likely signal a bounce. It just remains to be seen whether this bounce would be strong enough to take the price back into the ascending channel once more. Gold is acting like the traditional flight to safety Source: TradingView While the S&P 500 breaks down, gold, the traditional flight to safety, has just done a remarkably bullish thing and has broken out of the top of its own ascending channel. With gold making new all-time highs on practically a weekly basis, why is Bitcoin at such a low ebb? Bitcoin falls out of channel on short-term time frame Source: TradingView The 4-hour Bitcoin chart shows the breakdown of the ascending channel , and that the price has descended to the 0.618 Fibonacci at $81,340. The measured move for the breakdown is to $80,200, so this is still a possible downside target. With the stock market likely to open in the red on Monday, it remains to be seen how much further Bitcoin can be dragged down. Bitcoin approaches decision time: bounce or collapse? Source: TradingView The weekly time frame shows how Bitcoin is getting nearer to the important decision point. The price will either fall through the $80,000 horizontal support, and potentially carry on down to $70,000, or it will turn back up and break through the descending trendline. Two very big factors that will help to decide the direction of $BTC is the RSI and the Stochastic RSI. The RSI is displaying the extremely strong support (orange line) at the level of 44.00. If the indicator line falls through this, it will be very consequential. Also, the Stochastic RSI is showing that the indicator lines are possibly beginning to roll over. While not as drastic as the RSI losing that 44.00 structural support level, if the Stochastic RSI crosses back down it will signal further downside momentum.

In a March 31 X post, pseudonymous analyst RJT.WAGMI, with 124K followers, pointed out that Cardano appears to be forming a classic “ABCDE” triangle pattern, a type of consolidation structure often seen before major breakouts. Source: X/RJT_WAGMI In this setup, the price moves in five distinct waves labeled A through E within a tightening range, typically ending with a strong move in one direction. Per the analyst, ADA is currently in the middle of the C wave, a downward leg, but once it completes the D and E waves, a strong breakout to the upside could follow. RJT added that a bounce from the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone could serve as the launchpad for a move toward $1.5. “This is where OGs buy,” he noted, implying that experienced traders tend to accumulate when this pattern forms. You might also like: Cardano price could surge to $2 as whale purchases rise Fellow analyst CW echoed a similar sentiment. He noted that ADA was respecting its long-term trend and was hovering near the lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle pattern, a classic consolidation setup where price compresses between converging trend lines. Per the analyst, once ADA breaks above the convergence zone, there’s little to no resistance until $1.9. “Everything will start in an instant,” he wrote, pointing out continued net buying as a bullish sign. According to CoinGlass data, investors have mostly been accumulating the altcoin, with net outflows showing up on most days since March 3. This means more tokens are being taken off exchanges than added, a sign of strong investor belief in its long-term potential. Source: CoinGlass Adding another layer to the bullish case, analyst Master Kenobi compared ADA’s current price action to its behavior in August–September 2024. Back then, the token saw a strong rally after it went through a lengthy consolidation period. With ADA not posting a new low following its Feb. 3 dip to $0.49, just like in the previous cycle, he believes a similar breakout could unfold in May, potentially pushing the price as high as $2.5. However, at presstime, ADA was still under bearish pressure, with its price down 6.2% over the past day at $0.64 while its market cap stood at $23.3 billion. ADA technical analysis On the 1-day/USDT price chart, the 50-day moving average stood above the 200-day moving average, a bullish setup that signals ongoing sustained momentum and strengthens the case for a potential breakout. ADA price, 50-day and 200-day SMA — March 31 | Source: crypto.news The Supertrend indicator has fallen below the price level and has turned green, another sign of a potential reversal in trend soon. ADA Supertrend and RSI chart — March 31 | Source: crypto.news Its Relative Strength Index, dropping to $3,9, looks primed to hit the oversold levels soon, which could encourage bulls to step in and push the price higher. Meanwhile, ADA’s MVRV Z-score has dropped to 0.0077 — its lowest since early March — indicating that the average holder is nearing breakeven. This level often marks a point where selling pressure eases and accumulation begins, increasing the likelihood of a price rebound if market sentiment shifts. However, looking at data from IntoTheBlock, ADA’s price correlation with Bitcoin at press time stood at 0.79, indicating a strong positive relationship over the past 30 days. This means that ADA’s next move would hinge on Bitcoin, which has been on a downtrend ahead of President Donald Trump’s U.S. reciprocal tariffs .

33767162,[object Object],1743415239,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Market Headwinds To Continue? Short-Term Holder SOPR Remain In Negative Territory,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sths-sopr-negative/,"The previous week was quite interesting for Bitcoin as it recovered the $88,000 mark but faced significant resistance at this level, leading to a pullback near $81,000. During this movement, BTC saw notable selling pressure from investors who sold their holdings at a loss. Persistent Negative Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Bitcoin’s bearish pressure is intensifying as it struggles within the $83,000 and $82,500 price range after a drop from the $88,000 level. Thus far, Short-term holders seem to be taking the ongoing volatility in the market harder than long-term holders. A recent research shared by on-chain and technical expert Darkfost on X (formerly Twitter) has outlined a persistent trend among short-term Bitcoin holders. Darkfost revealed the trend after delving into the Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) Multiples metric, which compares the realized selling price with the original purchase price. This development indicates that short-term holders are still realizing losses on their BTC holdings. According to the on-chain expert, the key metric has stayed within the negative territory for over 2 months. Data from the metric shows that the short-term holder SOPR is currently fluctuating around the 0.98 level, which implies that these investors are offloading their coins at a loss. The persistent negative SOPR trend reflects a challenging market environment where weak hands continue to give up while long-term holders await signs of renewed strength in Bitcoin’s price action. Typically, when the ratio falls below level 1, it suggests that short-term holders are capitulating, which frequently results in brief price reductions. With BTC’s price struggling to recover, the bearish movement is likely to extend as the SOPR indicator continues to show weakness. Specifically, the trend was determined by observing the amount of BTC being sent to crypto exchanges at a loss. Presently, about 46,000 BTC has been transferred to crypto exchanges to be sold at a loss, reflecting low confidence among investors. Darkfost highlighted that these developments are blatant indicators that the market will be challenging in the short term. Short-Term BTC Holders In Loss During the recent correction, short-term holders accumulated significant losses . World-leading on-chain data and financial platform Glassnode reported that the overall loss realization in the Bitcoin market was recorded among these investors, often classified as holders of less than 155 days. While these holders witnessed substantial losses, long-term holders , usually those holding BTC for at least 155 days, remain in profit. However, the long-term holders are the major cause of profit-taking. Data shows that the losses incurred by short-term holders of BTC are now almost equal to the profits taken by long-term holders. This return to a neutral zone indicates a slowdown in profit-taking resistance, a stagnation in capital inflows, and a decline in demand.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Spent Output Profit Ratio|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Darkfost|Glassnode|sopr,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|NOT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-31 10:00:39
42690997,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=721047,1743415242,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42690997.jpeg,XRP Bull Cycle Could End If This Happens: Analyst,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-bull-cycle-could-end-if-this-happens/,"XRP’s multi-month uptrend may be approaching a critical inflection point, according to technical analyst Josh Olszewicz, known online as @CarpeNoctom. In a chart published on X, Olszewicz highlighted a well-defined bearish reversal pattern, warning that a breakdown could trigger significant downside movement. “I’d be shocked if this actually breaks higher,” the analyst wrote, adding in a livestream that the structure “continues to be the only thing I care about on this chart.” Could This Be The End Of The XRP Bull Cycle? His central thesis is built on a classic head and shoulders pattern, a formation widely recognized by traders as a precursor to a major trend reversal. The chart, based on the XRP/USD daily timeframe, reveals a symmetrical triple-peak structure that fits the textbook definition of a head and shoulders pattern. The left shoulder formed between early and mid-December 2024, topping out near the $2.90 level. This was followed by a higher high in mid-January 2025, when XRP briefly surged to approximately $3.40, forming the head. Subsequently, the right shoulder developed throughout mid-February and March 2025 with a lower high, around the $3.00 region. Related Reading: XRP Price Fate Hangs on $2.00—Major Move Incoming? The neckline — a critical horizontal support level that connects the swing lows between the shoulders — is drawn precisely at the $2.00 mark. This level is not only a psychological round number but also structurally significant, having acted as support multiple times since December last year. Overlaying the pattern is the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. The Ichimoku metrics currently reinforce the bearish outlook. XRP is trading beneath both the Tenkan-sen (conversion line) at $2.2462 and the Kijun-sen (base line) at $2.4528 — both of which are flatlining, indicating a loss of upward momentum. The Senkou Span A (leading span A), currently at $2.4836, and Senkou Span B at $1.9460 form a cloud that is thick, flat, and bearish. Price action is consolidating within the cloud, but the cloud ahead turns red, forecasting resistance and trend weakness in the sessions to come. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes 20% Move With Golden Pocket Appearance Olszewicz stated unequivocally in his livestream that if the pattern confirms with a breakdown, “you’d be expecting $1.13 to $1.40” as a measured move target. This range represents the potential depth of the head and shoulders formation — calculated by subtracting the height from the head ($3.40) to the neckline ($2.10), which gives approximately $1.30 of projected downside. When subtracted from the neckline level, this yields targets between $1.10 and $1.40, depending on volatility and order book depth. He added, “There is not an impossibility that this just rolls over the entirety of the move. Now that would be end-of-cycle stuff. That would be a bearish legacy, bearish everything — right? But that is in the cards here. You can’t say it’s not until we’re back above $2.85.” With that, Olszewicz clearly defined $2.85 as the invalidation level for this bearish thesis. Notably, this level marks the last significant lower high before price began to roll over — and it coincides with the top of the right shoulder. A close above that point would invalidate the head and shoulders formation and likely suggest a continuation of the bullish cycle. Until then, however, the risk remains tilted to the downside. At press time, XRP traded at $2.07.

Among the hardest-hit segments are meme coins, which have seen sharp pullbacks in recent days. Dogecoin, the original and most recognized meme token, continues to follow a persistent bearish trend — one that may not reverse unless current levels hold firm. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Eyes $1,200-$1,300 Level As Potential Acquisition Zone – Details Investor sentiment across the space remains cautious, with rising macroeconomic uncertainty and weakening momentum dragging prices lower. For Dogecoin, this moment is especially critical, as its price action now hovers just above the lower boundary of a long-term parallel channel. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared technical insights revealing that Dogecoin is still holding above this crucial support level. According to Martinez, a spike in demand from this zone could act as the launchpad for a rally toward the mid or upper range of the channel — potentially offering much-needed relief for DOGE holders. While broader market conditions remain fragile, Dogecoin’s structure suggests it still has room to rebound — but only if buyers step in soon. As price compresses near support, the next move could define the token’s short-term trend in a market filled with uncertainty. Dogecoin Down 66% As Market Uncertainty Weighs On Sentiment Dogecoin is currently trading under heavy pressure, down approximately 66% from its multi-year high near $0.48. Despite brief attempts at recovery, underwhelming price action and bearish sentiment continue to drag DOGE lower, with bulls struggling to find momentum in an increasingly volatile market. The broader macroeconomic backdrop isn’t helping either — rising interest rates, geopolitical instability, and trade war tensions have all contributed to a high-risk environment across global financial markets. This turbulence is having an outsized impact on speculative assets, and meme coins like Dogecoin remain some of the most vulnerable. The current conditions suggest that heightened volatility may become the new norm for the foreseeable future, increasing the risk of further downside for DOGE unless strong support holds. Martinez’s technical outlook on X notes that the $0.15 level is now essential for Dogecoin bulls. According to his analysis, DOGE continues to trade just above the lower boundary of a long-term bullish channel — a structure that has held firm through multiple market cycles. Martinez emphasizes that a spike in demand at this level could trigger a sharp rally, potentially pushing DOGE toward the mid or upper range of the channel, between $4 and $7. While this may seem ambitious given current sentiment, the long-term setup remains technically intact — but bulls must step in now to avoid a complete breakdown. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Ratio Nears 160-Day MA Crossover – Accumulation Trend Ahead? DOGE Bears Push Bulls to the Edge Dogecoin is trading at $0.16 after facing intense selling pressure over the past several days, dropping more than 20% in under a week. The sharp decline has placed bulls in a difficult position, with momentum clearly favoring the bears. The price structure remains decisively bearish, and if DOGE fails to hold the critical $0.15 support level, a dramatic collapse could follow — potentially sending the meme coin into lower demand zones not seen in months. The $0.15 mark now stands as the last line of defense for bulls, as it aligns with a key long-term support level within a broader bullish channel. Losing it would likely trigger panic selling and confirm a breakdown in market structure. However, if Dogecoin can maintain support above $0.16 and attract renewed buying interest, there’s still potential for a short-term recovery. A bounce from current levels could spark a rally toward the $0.20–$0.25 range — a zone that previously acted as strong resistance and may offer the first real test of any upward momentum.

The analyst is optimistic that Bitcoin price might flip the $100,000 psychological level and explode to $101,000. Peter Brandt Flips His Bearish Bitcoin Price Forecast to Bullish Bitcoin price today trades at $82,100 with a 1.5% decline in 24 hours and a daily low of $81,362. The downtrend comes amid a massive capital outflow from risk assets after President Trump noted that the reciprocal tariff push would apply to all countries. However, despite the bearish headwinds, Peter Brandt has opined that the BTC price might be on the verge of a trend reversal. In his analysis, Brandt identified a head and shoulders pattern that hints towards an uptrend. Bitcoin Price Chart Nevertheless, Brandt remained skeptical about the reliability of the pattern due to the sloping necklines. He stated that an inverse head and shoulders pattern with a horizontal neckline was “far more reliable.” While responding to Brandt’s analysis on X, Nat Robbins shared an even higher price target noting that Bitcoin will reach $135,000 . He said, “I think this is just a retest of the neckline of the largest inverse H&S pattern. The target is still $135,000. I see no reason why this latest and largest one won’t meet its target.” Despite the bullish forecast, several signs indicate that the Bitcoin bull run might be over. On-chain Data Shows Mixed Signals on Bitcoin On-chain data makes a bearish case for Bitcoin price and indicates that there is a risk for more downside. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) has formed a death cross after crossing below the 365-day MVRV. Per analyst Yonsei, this crossover suggests that the short-term momentum has weakened, increasing the risk of the downward pressure. More importantly, the analyst noted that there was no sign that the bottom was in yet, further highlighting a bearish Bitcoin price prediction . BTC MVRV Ratio However, despite the MVRV showing a heightened risk of further downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin, exchange supply data indicates that some traders are moving their Bitcoin from exchanges, which leans towards accumulation. Popular analyst Ali Charts noted that in the last week, more than 30,000 BTC has left exchanges . This hints that the recent dip may have pushed Bitcoin to an accumulation zone. As analyst predictions and on-chain data show a mixed market sentiment, BTC traders should watch out for the price defending the $80,000 support level. If Bitcoin manages to hold above this zone, it could fulfill the bullish price forecast. Conversely, if BTC drops below $80,000 , it might cause more panic selling.

This week, one coin in particular has captured the market’s attention— $MOVE . The Movement Network’s native token is currently trending on CoinGecko, and it looks like a surge of interest and activity has pushed it to the head of the cryptocurrency pack. Following closely behind are two other coins that have been part of the week’s discussions: $NIL, the token of the Nillion Network, and $SUI, which represents the Sui Network. These coins not only are gaining market attention but also are tied to some pretty significant events that could impact the broader crypto ecosystem. Movement Network Foundation to launch 38M $USDT buyback of $MOVE tokens The Movement Network Foundation announced on its website that following a notification from Binance about an ongoing investigation involving a market maker (MM) and various tokens, including MOVE, the… — CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) March 25, 2025 Movement Network’s Major Deposit Sparks Curiosity This week, $MOVE has become the most popular coin, and it’s easy to see why. A huge move took place just a few hours ago when a Movement Treasury address sent a jaw-dropping 7 million $MOVE tokens to Coinbase. We are talking about a transfer here worth $3.3 million. Now, huge transfers are always worth mentioning, but when they involve a coin that’s trending, it doubles the interest, in my opinion. This deposit is made all the more interesting by the interaction it reveals between the Movement Treasury and a well-known market participant. The address linked to the deposit has a history of dealing with Flow Traders, a prominent market maker. The connection raises the prospect that this transaction might involve Flow Traders or some other market maker, though it isn’t clear at the moment if that’s the case. Market makers are really important players in the crypto scene, often responsible for providing liquidity, and the better their scene is, the more room there is for making it work and for making it stable. This event, while drawing notice, is also part of a larger strategic play by the Movement Network Foundation. According to the foundation’s official website, they have announced plans to use any funds they might recover from an ongoing investigation into Binance Binance and certain of its business practices, notably those that pertain to a market maker and various tokens, including $MOVE. The Movement Network has made it clear that any such funds will be used to bolster the Movement ecosystem. Top 20 Trending Coins on CoinGecko This week, $MOVE ( @movementlabsxyz ) leads the pack, followed by $NIL ( @nillionnetwork ) in second place, and $SUI ( @SuiNetwork ) in third. Are you keeping an eye on these? https://t.co/wR2b6z7a17 pic.twitter.com/ZXMHokcXZF — CoinGecko (@coingecko) March 28, 2025 Movement Network’s Strategic Reserve Plans What this means, in short, is that the Movement Network Foundation is developing a reserve of $MOVE tokens. The way they are going about it is quite interesting. They have a very detailed program that covers not just this buyback initiative but also the overall strategy and vision for the token. The $MOVE token is an essential component of the foundation’s market design. It is crucial for the foundation and these tokens to be liquid and stable in the market. Ilan Lobel from the foundation has penned a detailed outline of the buyback and reserve initiative. The Movement Strategic Reserve is a proactive step in the right direction to provide stability to the token and ensure its continued growth. For the crypto community, this is not a series of moves focused on short-term gains. Instead, the Movement Network seems intent on securing long-term success for $MOVE and its broader ecosystem. Other Trending Coins: $NIL and $SUI Certainly, $MOVE is this week’s highlight, but we must recognize the other two coins that are making waves. $NIL, the token of the Nillion Network, sits at No. 2 on CoinGecko’s trending list. Nillion is a privacy and decentralized computing project, one that could seriously shake up the current blockchain landscape. Why? Because the demand for privacy solutions isn’t going down; in fact, it’s going up. And with that rising tide, $NIL is emerging as a token to watch. Occupying the third position is $SUI, which is associated with the Sui Network. Sui is an efficient blockchain that is purposefully built for Web3. The core offerings of Sui are speed and scalability. Not only is Sui designed to be a new DeFi powerhouse, but it is also a friendly environment for NFTs and smart contracts. Conclusion: A Week of Movement and Strategy The cryptocurrency world had an especially notable week, with a large influx of tokens directed toward Coinbase that caught the attention of observers. This was not just any old deposit, though; it was a substantial transfer of $MOVE tokens that seemed to signal something important for the token’s nascent project. By the end of the week, we had some idea what that might be, as the project associated with $MOVE, called the Movement Project, unveiled some ambitious plans. The Movement Network is clearly moving, and with a strategic plan in place and the evolution of blockchain technologies, might have a lasting impact on the crypto market. Investors and enthusiasts will keep a close eye on the developments this week. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

On Wednesday, March 26, the upswing abruptly ended, and trading between Thursday and Friday proved particularly damaging. Digital assets erased more than $100 billion within a single day. Furthermore, weekend movements quashed any hopes of a swift positive correction. Indeed, between Friday and Monday, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization plunged another $110 billion, with the 24 hours leading to the morning of March 31 alone erasing nearly $38 billion. Total cryptocurrency market cap one-week price chart. Source: TradingView The relative shock of the turn – and the sentiment driving the preceding climb – can be gauged based on the community ‘ideas’ Finbold retrieved from TradingView on March 31. Crypto community weighs in on the market crash Specifically, most recent cryptocurrency market cap chart analyses paint a bullish picture, though there have been several bears as well. VictoriaCobra , a popular analyst on the platform, posted a rather grim estimate that ‘the good crypto narrative is over.’ The community expert pointed to a set of factors backing the idea that the current cycle is out of opportunities for a true breakout. For example, they pointed out that total market capitalization is near the 2021 highs despite the 2024 bull market , while the number of active Bitcoin ( BTC ) addresses is close to the levels seen in 2017. BTC price and active address chart. Source: Glassnode Furthermore, the discrepancy between gold’s and BTC’s performance was highlighted as doing much to undermine the ‘store of value’ argument, while President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s actions have eroded digital assets’ credibility. Lastly, the analyst concluded that despite the activity and the rise in valuation, cryptocurrencies lack a true footprint outside their own ecosystem. Simultaneously, other prolific community experts have been bullish. CryptoNikkoid opined that a ‘storm’ is coming and that it would lead to a strong bull run while pointing out the relative strength index ( RSI ) of digital assets – painting them as oversold – and of the S&P 500 – positioning the index as overbought. The analyst simultaneously pointed out that the dollar index (DXY) has been weakening along with the stocks. Ultimately, the Trading View expert revealed that between the equity outflows and the situation with the DXY, a significant amount of cash has been freed up for the cryptocurrency market. They identified June at the latest as the time the bull market will restart and opined major digital assets, Bitcoin most notably, could double in value. Is the crypto market more bullish or bearish in 2025? Though the possibility of a renewed bull cycle almost always exists, recent trends appear to back the bear cases more strongly. Cryptocurrencies have generally followed the stock market, with even the latest downturn coming mere days after new and adverse data center bubble and tariff news shook the more traditional assets. Furthermore, while many would agree that the S&P 500 turned far more overbought than cryptocurrencies during 2024, money has been steadily flowing out from corporate equity and, unfortunately for blockchain optimists, appears to be fueling ‘legacy’ safe havens like gold far more than other risk assets.

For every 100% SHIB price pump in 2025, this token could skyrocket 1,000%",https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/31/is-shiba-inu-still-a-good-investment-for-every-100-shib-price-pump-in-2025-this-token-could-skyrocket-1000/,"Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) is still a well-liked meme currency, its long-term prospects are called into doubt due to its volatility and crowded market position. In 2025, analysts predict that SHIB’s price might rise by 100%. But another token, Rexas Finance (RXS) , is drawing interest with a novel offer: RXS might rise 10 times for every 2x increase SHIB makes. With RXS already up 580% during its presale and analysts projecting a post-launch worth of $10+, investors are turning their attention elsewhere. Rexas Finance uses tokenisation to enable worldwide fractional ownership by bridging the gap between blockchain technology and physical assets like gold and real estate. Supported by a CertiK audit and featured on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, RXS positions itself as a high-growth option in the cryptocurrency industry by fusing innovation with legitimacy. Rexas Finance redefining real-world asset ownership Investors’ interactions with tangible assets are being revolutionised by Rexas Finance. Access to traditional markets, such as gold and real estate, has long been restricted by money and region, despite their total worth surpassing $30 trillion. By tokenizing assets on the blockchain, Rexas eliminates these obstacles. Consider a student in Nigeria investing in commercial real estate in Dubai or a teacher in Brazil buying a portion of a flat in Tokyo. The platform democratises wealth-building opportunities by enabling users to purchase, sell, or fractionalise assets in a matter of seconds. The ERC-20 token powers a suite of tools designed for seamless asset integration. The Rexas Token Builder lets anyone convert real-world holdings into tradeable tokens, while the Launchpad enables fundraising for new projects. The Quickmint Bot simplifies token creation, and AI-driven tools like GenAI and AI Shield enhance security and user experience. By merging tangible value with blockchain efficiency, Rexas is eliminating the gap between physical assets and digital ownership. RXS presale momentum and strategic tokenomics Rexas Finance has prioritized community growth over venture capital backing, reserving 50% of its 1 billion tokens for public presale. Early stages sold out rapidly, raising $47.1 million of its $56 million target. Stage 12—the final phase—prices RXS at $0.20, a 6.6x jump from its initial $0.03. With 91.2% of presale tokens already claimed, the project is nearing its June 2025 launch, where RXS will debut on exchanges at $0.25. Tokenomics allocate 22.5% to staking rewards, 15% to liquidity, and 10% to treasury reserves, ensuring stability and long-term incentives. A $1 million giveaway has amplified interest, offering 20 winners $50,000 each. Participants submit ERC-20 wallet addresses, complete social tasks, and earn extra entries through referrals. Combined with listings on top-tier exchanges post-launch, Rexas is leveraging visibility and trust to drive adoption. The CertiK-audited smart contracts further reassure investors, addressing security concerns common in decentralized projects. Why Rexas Finance outshines market alternatives While SHIB relies on speculative trading, RXS ties its value to trillion-dollar real-world markets. Tokenized assets generate passive income through rent, dividends, or appreciation, offering utility beyond typical crypto volatility. For example, a $10,000 RXS investment today could grow to $500,000 if the token hits $10, as analysts forecast. This potential stems from Rexas’s first-mover advantage in asset tokenization—a sector projected to expand 1,000% by 2030. Investors entering the presale now secure tokens at $0.20 before the June launch. Historical data shows assets with strong presale performance often surge post-listing. RXS’s presale trajectory mirrors Solana’s early growth, which saw 100x returns within a year. With SHIB’s gains capped by its meme-driven model, RXS offers a calculated entry into a market poised for exponential growth. The verdict on high-potential investments Shiba Inu may deliver short-term gains, but Rexas Finance unlocks transformative wealth-building opportunities. By merging blockchain with real estate, commodities, and art, RXS creates tangible value for global investors. The presale’s final stage offers a narrowing window to buy below the $0.25 launch price. With tier-1 exchange listings, a $1 million giveaway, and AI-powered tools, Rexas is not just keeping pace with the crypto market—it’s redefining it. For those seeking assets with 50x potential, RXS stands as a compelling choice in 2025’s investment landscape.

Content creators have undeniably transformed the internet in recent years. Adult or NSFW content creators, in particular, have seen a rise in popularity and increased demand for personalized fan interactions. You might also like: Redefining trust and ownership in the creator economy | Opinion Platforms such as OnlyFans, Patreon, and Cameo have reshaped traditional boundaries, providing creators with direct lines to their fans and empowering them financially in unprecedented ways. Yet, from my experience as CMO of OnlyFans, I observed a persistent challenge that even the most successful creators face: the struggle to scale genuine connections. For instance, some of our top creators would spend hours each day personally responding to hundreds of fan messages, only to find themselves overwhelmed, exhausted, and still unable to meet fans’ growing expectations. While creators flourish when engagement is authentic and personal, there is inevitably a cap—human limits on time, energy, and availability. Burnout, diminishing returns, and stalled growth become real concerns, particularly as creators become more successful. Historically, some creators have tackled the issue of scalability by outsourcing fan engagement. But this often resulted in diluted authenticity, increased costs, and potential brand damage if interactions weren’t consistent with the creator’s tone of voice. Fans crave authenticity; any compromise risks eroding the fundamental trust underpinning creator-fan relationships. The shift from traditional creator-fan engagement to an AI-enhanced model is like stepping through a portal into a new world—one where past limitations fade away. Artificial intelligence represents a critical turning point in online creator economies. Not as a replacement for human creativity but as a powerful new tool to amplify and sustain it. The real value of AI in the creator economy isn’t just about efficiency; it’s about enabling creators to maintain authenticity at scale, offering personalized experiences without sacrificing intimacy, privacy, or emotional energy. AI to enhance—not replace—human interaction But what does an AI-enhanced creator-fan engagement model actually look like? The short answer is it varies. But one manifestation is creator-owned AI-powered digital representations of real human creators. This model offers continuous, personalized interaction without compromising the human element that fans genuinely seek. These AI personas can faithfully replicate a human creator’s style, tone, and nuances, providing fans with a meaningful sense of connection around the clock. It’s a technology that still allows creators to retain full control over their digital representations, maintaining brand consistency and personal boundaries without the heavy cost or risks involved in traditional outsourcing. Moreover, AI unlocks entirely new creative opportunities beyond traditional messaging. For example, personalized voice notes, bespoke imagery, interactive storytelling, or dynamic experiences tailored to individual fans’ preferences can profoundly deepen fan engagement. Rather than simply mimicking interactions, AI technology—when ethically implemented—empowers creators to explore entirely new forms of digital intimacy and storytelling. Economically, AI democratizes access in a creator economy that has become increasingly exclusive. Previously, personalized engagement with popular creators was typically costly, limiting deeper connections to only those who could afford premium access. AI fundamentally changes these economics, making personalized experiences widely accessible while allowing creators to sustainably grow their income without exhausting themselves. Some fear AI’s growing role risks diluting human authenticity or even replacing creators. But from my perspective and experience in digital content innovation, AI’s role is quite the opposite. Rather than replacing creators, AI augments and amplifies their human potential, allowing them to reach more fans authentically, explore deeper creative opportunities, and avoid burnout from unsustainable demand. The future of the creator economy lies not in choosing between humanity and technology but in integrating them thoughtfully and ethically. Multimodel, agentic AI presents creators and fans alike with a win-win scenario: creators can protect their well-being and creative energy, and unlock infinite scale while more fans gain greater access, more meaningful interactions, and truly personalized experiences. As someone who’s seen the evolution first-hand from traditional digital platforms to emerging frontiers, I believe AI represents a mutually beneficial development in the creator economy. It’s not about replacing human connection but enriching it. We are entering a new era, and it’s one that creators and their fans can equally look forward to enjoying.

Globacap Private Markets Inc, a broker-dealer and alternative trading system (ATS) regulated by FINRA and the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC), is being bought by Archax and being renamed to Archax Markets US. The new entity will serve as the company's foothold on American soil and serve the institutions and professional investors in the country, two Archax executives told CoinDesk. Asset tokenization is a fast-growing sector in crypto as global banks, asset managers and digital asset firms are increasingly using blockchain rails to move traditional financial instruments. They do so to achieve operational efficiencies and speedier,around-the-clock settlements. Just in the past weeks, asset manager Fidelity Investments filed to launch a tokenized money market fund and is reportedly working on issuing a stablecoin . Derivatives exchange CME Group started tokenization tests with Google Cloud with plans to launch new services next year, while the New York Stock Exchange's parent company partnered with Circle to explore services built on USDC stablecoin and tokenized fund USYC. Archax specializes in the issuance, custody, and trading of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), including money market funds, corporate bonds, carbon credits and uranium. For example, Archax's recently-issued tokenized Treasury fund on XRP Ledger with asset manager Abrdn saw $45 million in deposits to become a top 10 product by assets under management, rwa.xyz data shows. Archax has been exploring entering the U.S. market over the past years, but stayed on the sideline due to regulatory uncertainty, Graham Rodford, CEO of Archax, said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""Under this new administration, which seems to be more crypto positive, we are getting more interest from the U.S. as well, which obviously we can't easily serve from the UK, so it makes sense for us strategically to go there,"" Rodford said. Archax also plans to expand its offerings to tokenized U.S. equities and bonds, building on its existing partnerships across several blockchains including Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Hedera Hashgraph and XRP Ledger. The firm's U.S. entrance follows the recent purchase of a Spanish brokerage firm to expand services to the European Union, pending regulatory approvals.",Finance|Tokenized Assets|Real World Assets|Broker-Dealers|Exclusive|acquisition,EN,0,0,MARKET|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-31 11:27:54

However, a new challenger, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is performing well with its aggressive growth trajectory. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), going through its fourth funding phase while demonstrating rapid growth at a price point of $0.025 and managed to secure nearly $5.8 million from investors. Over 7500 holders have entered the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale during phase 4 due to the system plans to raise its price from $0.025 to $0.03. Those starting to invest now during this phase means investors can earn 140% return at launch price of $0.06. MUTM could hit $4 after launch. A DeFi Powerhouse Gaining Traction Mutuum Finance is transforming the decentralized lending market through its revolutionary dual-lending technology which drives its exponential growth. Approximately 7500 investors have partaken in support of the project by investing $5.8 million after recognizing its value potential during its presale period. The current price of Mutuum Finance Token stands at $0.025 in Phase 4 but investors will experience additional value from the upcoming Phase 5 price increase of 20%. Mutuum Finance brings out the revolutionary change to Defi by incorporating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2P provides passive income opportunities to customers by placing them in USDT liquidity pools through smart contract managed automatic lending capabilities. The P2P method enables direct lending relations that allow customers to operate deals without intermediaries while keeping their capital intact. The linkage of P2C and P2P models at Mutuum Finance creates an investment opportunity with enhanced safety alongside improved efficiency and decentralized features as a DeFi investment solution for maximum-yield seekers. A Secure and Trustworthy Financial Ecosystem Mutuum Finance plans to construct a completely collateralized stablecoin backed by USD fixed within the Ethereum blockchain to support its entire ecosystem. This cryptocurrency exceeds algorithmic stablecoins’ requirements by using extra collateral thus reducing both the risks and maintaining stability over time. Such an approach provides complete investor confidence because it combines open financial architecture with audited smart contracts while avoiding the failures that devastated other DeFi projects. The company builds its community base through rewarding investors with attractive benefits. The fund will send 10 fortunate participants $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens through its million-dollar token distribution campaign combined with its award-winning referral system that rewards users for acquiring new participants. The platform offers exclusive staking pools and governance rights and VIP update access to its early adopting community members as they develop long-term loyalty with Mutuum Finance. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth The tokenomics system of this project uses mechanisms which control token release and promote price stability for the long-term. Scarcity of tokens and deflationary mechanisms applied during presales lead Mutuum Finance to establish price appreciation potential in the long term. High incentive rewards and active token participation are possible through its staking feature which builds long-term functionality and maintains a healthy ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a strong competitor to Cardano (ADA) with its innovative dual-lending model, investor-focused incentives, and sustainable tokenomics. With over 7,500 holders and an impressive $5.8 million raised during its presale, the project is rapidly gaining traction in the DeFi space. Investors who enter early stand to gain substantial returns, especially as analysts predict a potential price surge to $4 post-launch. As Phase 4 of the presale nears its end, now is the time to secure MUTM tokens at $0.025 before the price increases. Don’t miss out and join the Mutuum Finance presale today and be part of the future of decentralized finance.

Investor Says Real-World Adoption Holds The Key,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-to-20k-investor-says-real-world-adoption-holds-the-key/,"Ethereum’s chances of reaching the $20,000 level are fueling debate among investors and analysts. The success of the Ethereum network is dependent on real-world usage and rising activity on its platforms, so it is an area of focus in the cryptocurrency space. Related Reading: Pi Coin Sinks 47% In 14 Days—What’s Behind The Massive Drop? Real-World Usage Is The Key Ryan Berckmans, an investor in Ethereum, thinks that the key to a $20,000 ETH price is practical use. He says that the high fees, while normally a disadvantage, are actually an indicator of faith in the altcoin. If users are paying more, it is because they trust in the value of the network. Berckmans makes the comparison with Bitcoin, which continues to hold value despite 99% of its usage being centralized. He reiterates that Ethereum needs to pay attention to developing its real-world growth if it is to replicate this success. For ETH, real world growth is the answer. How do we get ETH to $20k? Fee value accrual obviously isn’t necessary to drive the required public confidence for a high token price, otherwise BTC would be worthless because 99.999% of BTC activity is centralized and doesn’t accrue… — Ryan Berckmans (@ryanberckmans) March 29, 2025 Importance Of High Fees Restoring high total fees is critical for Ethereum’s price increase. Berckmans argues that even if a hypothetical scenario sees $1 trillion in stablecoins on Ethereum’s Layer 1, it wouldn’t be enough without high fees to back it up. He suggests that the Ethereum network must prioritize robust growth to ensure that investor confidence is restored. Without this growth, reaching the ambitious target of $20,000 seems unlikely. Scaling Through Layer 1 And Layer 2 Berckmans stresses the need for more Layer 1 applications and better integration with Layer 2 solutions. This expansion is vital for sustainable growth. Ethereum must increase the distribution of its Layer 1 assets to Layer 2s while also diversifying the solutions available on Layer 2. This kind of scaling is essential to accommodate growing network activity and user demand. Focusing On Utility-Driven Growth As Ethereum celebrates the 10-year anniversary of its mainnet, Berckmans insists that the network has come a long way but still has much further to go.

Ethereum is the most capitalized blockchain by application but will need to scale dramatically to maintain its position. By prioritizing the development of a culture centered around real-world uses and economic development, the crypto asset can build a bridge to its price target. The Ethereum network is at a crossroads. The altcoin needs to maximize real-world usage and have growth at the top of its agenda. In doing so, it may well hit that much-sought $20,000 target in the future — at least according to Berckmans.

The Bitcoin mining landscape is about to get even more interesting. MARA Holdings, a major player in the BTC mining world, has just announced a jaw-dropping plan: a massive $2 billion stock sale. But this isn’t just about raising capital; it’s a strategic play to aggressively expand their Bitcoin reserves. Let’s dive into what this bold move means for MARA Holdings and the broader crypto market. Why is MARA Holdings Launching a $2 Billion Stock Sale? In a nutshell, MARA Holdings, formerly known as Marathon Digital, is doubling down on its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. They’re not just mining Bitcoin; they want to accumulate even more. According to their recent filing with the SEC, they’ve inked an ‘at-the-market’ (ATM) agreement with financial giants like Cantor Fitzgerald and Barclays. This ATM agreement allows MARA to gradually sell shares of its stock on the open market, raising up to a staggering $2 billion. Here’s a breakdown of why this stock sale is significant: Fueling Bitcoin Reserves: The primary goal is clear – to amass more Bitcoin. MARA Holdings is committed to its “full hold strategy,” meaning they are hoarding every precious Satoshi they mine and actively seeking to buy more. Strategic Capitalization: Raising capital through a stock sale in a bullish market allows MARA to leverage its company valuation to acquire a valuable and appreciating asset like Bitcoin. Market Position: This move solidifies MARA Holdings’ position as a leading public company in Bitcoin mining and accumulation. They are signaling strong confidence in Bitcoin’s future. MARA Holdings’ Bitcoin Investment Strategy: A Deep Dive MARA Holdings isn’t just dipping its toes into Bitcoin; they are diving headfirst into the digital gold rush. Their commitment to Bitcoin investment is evident in their current holdings and future plans. Let’s examine their strategy more closely: Full Hold Strategy: Stacking Sats CEO Fred Thiel has emphasized MARA’s “full hold strategy.” This isn’t just lip service. It’s a core philosophy. Unlike some miners who sell Bitcoin to cover operational costs, MARA is committed to keeping every Bitcoin they mine. This long-term vision aligns with the belief in Bitcoin’s increasing value over time. Aggressive Bitcoin Acquisition: Buying the Dip (and the Rips?) The $2 billion raise isn’t solely for mined Bitcoin; MARA explicitly states its intention to purchase even more BTC. As of March, they already held a substantial 46,374 BTC, placing them second only to MicroStrategy among public companies. This new capital injection suggests they are ready to aggressively increase their Bitcoin acquisition , potentially making strategic purchases during market dips or even riding bullish waves. Ranking Among Bitcoin Holders: Chasing MicroStrategy Currently, MARA Holdings proudly sits as the second-largest public company holder of Bitcoin, according to Bitbo data. While trailing behind MicroStrategy, this $2 billion stock sale and subsequent BTC investment could significantly close the gap. Are they aiming for the top spot? It certainly seems like a possibility. What are the Potential Benefits of MARA’s Bitcoin Stock Sale? This strategic maneuver by MARA Holdings is laden with potential benefits, not just for the company but potentially for the wider Bitcoin ecosystem. Let’s unpack some of the key advantages: Increased Bitcoin Holdings: The most direct benefit is a significant increase in MARA’s Bitcoin reserves. This positions them to capitalize on potential future Bitcoin price appreciation. Enhanced Market Valuation: Holding substantial Bitcoin reserves can positively impact MARA’s stock valuation, attracting investors who are bullish on Bitcoin and seeking indirect exposure through publicly traded companies. Strengthened Balance Sheet: Bitcoin, in the eyes of many, is becoming an increasingly accepted store of value. Holding a significant amount can strengthen MARA’s balance sheet and financial stability. Dominance in Bitcoin Mining Sector: By aggressively expanding their Bitcoin holdings, MARA is asserting its dominance and leadership in the Bitcoin mining industry. Are There Any Challenges or Risks? While this move is undoubtedly ambitious , it’s crucial to consider potential challenges and risks associated with MARA’s stock sale and BTC investment strategy: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. A significant Bitcoin price downturn could negatively impact the value of MARA’s holdings and potentially their stock price. Execution Risk: Successfully executing a $2 billion stock sale and deploying that capital effectively into Bitcoin acquisition requires skillful management and market timing. Dilution for Existing Shareholders: Selling new shares dilutes the ownership stake of existing shareholders. While the long-term goal is value creation through Bitcoin appreciation, short-term dilution can be a concern. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Unforeseen regulatory changes could impact MARA’s operations and Bitcoin holdings. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? MARA Holdings’ bold move offers several actionable insights for crypto investors and market observers: Confidence Signal for Bitcoin: A major public company like MARA making such a significant BTC investment sends a strong signal of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Monitor MARA Stock (MARA): Keep an eye on MARA’s stock performance. It can serve as a proxy for institutional sentiment towards Bitcoin and the mining sector. Broader Trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: This move reinforces the growing trend of institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Expect more public companies to explore similar strategies. Bitcoin Mining Sector in Focus: The Bitcoin mining sector is becoming increasingly important as institutions seek direct exposure to Bitcoin generation and accumulation. Conclusion: MARA Holdings’ Bitcoin Bet – A Game Changer? MARA Holdings’ $2 billion stock sale to fuel its Bitcoin acquisition is a revolutionary and significant development in the cryptocurrency space. It underscores the growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin and signals a potential new phase of aggressive accumulation by public companies. While risks exist, the potential rewards for MARA and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem are substantial.

ETH, together with PI, PEPE, and SOL, should be considered as altcoin to sell because of ongoing market uncertainties. The price of Bitcoin presently faces difficulties in maintaining a position above $81,000. Market-wide digital asset price corrections now occur due to increasing trade war uncertainty, which leads investors to become risk-averse The upcoming Wednesday marks the start of additional tariffs, which deeply concern investors in the markets. A set of new tariffs nearing 20% or above would impose trade restrictions on more than 25 nations, resulting in potential worldwide economic tensions. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index achieved its highest point bringing forth widespread market concern about the situation.

The ETH price suffered a major decline by falling beneath its essential $1,820 support during widespread market selling activities. The market value of Ethereum is $1,805 at the present moment with around a 15% decline from the previous week. A crypto analyst tweeted that Ethereum faces further price decline if it breaks through the essential support barrier at $1,750. ETH would likely descend to its next significant support level near $1,550 if it breaches the $1,750 local support after Trump announces tariffs. Pi Network (PI) The cryptocurrency Pi Network (PI) has experienced its largest fall of 70% throughout this month, which positions it as the most significant collapse within the top 100 cryptocurrencies. The lack of confidence among its members in PI Network is driving them to sell rapidly. When Pi Network launched in the market, it encountered selling pressure immediately following price stabilization. The latest integrations from Binance and the listing poll did not stop Pi Network from maintaining its bearish price movement. The cryptocurrency PI trades at $0.7064 while revealing an additional 10% decline over the previous 24 hours, ranking it among unsuitable altcoins. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Meme cryptocurrency PEPE Coin (PEPE) has suffered a major price decline, which caused it to break through important support thresholds. The current trading price of PEPE stands at $0.000007074, while the last 24 hours have brought a 7 percent decline.

The market bear control had trapped the asset inside an ongoing descending channel. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) approached the threshold at 38 while remaining in the oversold region. A rejected attempt to exceed the $130 price would establish conditions for another market downturn. A Solana price prediction move under $120 would both break down the breakout pattern and threaten to push the price all the way down to $110, rendering Solana an unfavorable altcoin to avoid until Trump makes his new trade policy announcements.

NFT marketplace X2Y2, which was launched as an alternative to OpenSea and LooksRare, will shut down on April 30, citing a steep decline in trading activity and the challenges of staying competitive. In a March 31 statement , the project’s mysterious TP founder said the X2Y2 team is “sunsetting X2Y2 as an NFT marketplace” after three years in the industry, adding that the “90% shrinkage of NFT trading volume from its peak in 2021 is for sure one of the many reasons.” “The NFT chapter taught us a lot — most of all, that lasting value beats chasing trends. That lesson’s why we’re drawing a line here, not a pause or a maybe, but a full stop on X2Y2 as we knew it.” TP, founder of X2Y2 You might also like: Magic Eden dominates NFT market as its share nears 37%: CoinGecko X2Y2, which was once positioned as a key player in the space, reaching $5.6 billion in all-time trading volume and peaking as the second-largest NFT marketplace behind OpenSea , has since shrunk to $53.6 million, per data from Token Terminal. The platform’s smart contracts will remain operational, allowing users to interact with them, but the team warned that the shutdown could impact its token. “I know this might sting, especially when it comes to token price.

In a recent statement, the company provided important information about the Stablecoin Rate Channel, a metric that has historically identified strong buying opportunities for Bitcoin and altcoins. Alphractal noted that the total market capitalization of stablecoins has been steadily increasing due to new issuances and capital rotation from altcoins to stable assets. This increase plays a crucial role in determining Bitcoin’s market trends. “When the stablecoin reaches the lower dotted line of the Rate Channel, it has historically signaled an excellent entry point for investors,” the firm’s analysts said. “This pattern suggests that there is a significant amount of stablecoins in the market relative to Bitcoin’s market cap, and this often occurs before the Bitcoin price declines and then recovers.” The Stablecoin Rate Channel (long-term) is designed to smooth out short-term volatility using the 90-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) applied to the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) Oscillator and further refined with a 7-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Related News: Exemplary Decision on the Most Dangerous Fraud Method for Cryptocurrency Holders The key components of the SSR Oscillator include: Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR): This is calculated by dividing Bitcoin's market cap by the stablecoin market cap and further smoothing it with the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Bollinger Bands Analysis: ±2 standard deviation bands help identify overbought and oversold conditions. Oscillator Signals: Blue Signals: Indicates low oscillator values and usually corresponds to major bottom signals. Red Signals: High oscillator values that signal potential market trend changes.

While the exact timing remains unclear, Alphractal explained that the current setup closely resembles previous accumulation zones that preceded Bitcoin price increases. “A major buy signal has yet to materialize, but based on historical trends we are rapidly approaching an ideal accumulation phase,” the statement said. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin (BTC), the king of cryptocurrencies, is facing a potentially grim milestone. Whispers are turning into worried shouts as we approach the end of March, with Bitcoin teetering on the edge of closing out its weakest first quarter (Q1) performance since the bear market days of 2018. Is this just a temporary tremor, or are we looking at something more significant? Let’s dive into the heart of the matter and dissect what’s fueling this unsettling trend in the Bitcoin market. Decoding Bitcoin’s Q1 2024 Performance: A Deep Dive Cointelegraph’s recent analysis has thrown a spotlight on a concerning reality: Bitcoin’s trajectory this March points towards a significant quarterly slump. To put it into perspective, the last time we witnessed such a lackluster Q1 for BTC was back in 2018, a year etched in crypto history for its prolonged market winter. What makes this potential downturn particularly noteworthy is the confluence of factors seemingly conspiring against Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. While the crypto market is known for its volatility, understanding the specific triggers behind this current dip is crucial for navigating the choppy waters ahead. But what exactly is contributing to this potential Q1 washout for Bitcoin? Let’s break down the key elements: Global Economic Jitters: The broader economic landscape is far from serene. Concerns about inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical instability are casting shadows over all markets, including crypto. Bitcoin, while often touted as a hedge against traditional finance, is not immune to these macroeconomic headwinds. Tariff Tensions Spark Market Downturn: Enter former U.S. President Donald Trump, whose recent policy pronouncements have sent ripples of apprehension through global markets. The introduction of a hefty 25% tariff on imported cars, coupled with hints of similar measures targeting the pharmaceutical industry, has ignited fears of escalating trade wars. These protectionist policies tend to spook investors, leading to a flight to safety and a general pullback from risk assets – and yes, cryptocurrencies often fall into this category in times of uncertainty. “Liberation Day” and Trader Anxiety: Adding fuel to the fire is Trump’s cryptic reference to April 2nd as “Liberation Day,” earmarked for unveiling further “reciprocal tariffs.” This ominous date hanging over the market is doing little to soothe trader nerves. The uncertainty surrounding these impending announcements is actively eroding trader confidence and prompting cautious, if not bearish, positioning in the market. Equity Market Mirroring Market Downturn: The traditional stock markets are already reflecting this anxiety. Stock futures have taken a tumble, with DOW futures plummeting by 206 points and S&P futures dipping by 0.56%. Historically, Bitcoin has shown a tendency to mirror movements in equity markets, at least to some extent. This correlation is playing out once again, with BTC prices echoing the downturn in equities. Bitcoin Price Decline: The numbers don’t lie. Bitcoin’s price has been on a consistent downward slide, reaching $81,656 on March 30th. This marks a seven-day streak of losses, painting a clear picture of the selling pressure gripping the Bitcoin market. Is This Just a Blip, or a Sign of a Deeper Bitcoin Market Downturn? The million-dollar question on every crypto investor’s mind is: is this current dip a temporary setback, a buying opportunity in disguise, or a harbinger of a more prolonged market downturn ? Predicting the future in the crypto world is notoriously difficult, but we can analyze the current signals and potential scenarios. Potential Bearish Scenarios: Escalating Tariff Wars: If Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcements indeed unleash a wave of new tariffs, the resulting trade tensions could intensify global economic uncertainty. This could further dampen investor sentiment and exert sustained downward pressure on risk assets like Bitcoin. Broader Economic Slowdown: The tariff issue is just one piece of the puzzle. If the global economy experiences a more pronounced slowdown due to inflation, interest rate hikes, or other factors, Bitcoin and the entire crypto market could face a challenging period. Negative Regulatory Developments: Unfavorable regulatory actions from governments around the world remain a persistent risk for the crypto space. Stricter regulations could stifle innovation and investor enthusiasm, contributing to a prolonged market downturn. Potential Bullish Counterarguments: Bitcoin’s Store of Value Narrative: Despite the current turbulence, Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition as a decentralized, censorship-resistant store of value remains intact. In times of economic uncertainty, this narrative could actually strengthen as investors seek alternatives to traditional assets. Institutional Adoption: Long-term, the trend of institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is still in play. Increased institutional involvement could provide a significant buffer against short-term market fluctuations and drive long-term price appreciation. Halving Event on the Horizon: The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will reduce the rate at which new Bitcoin is created, is historically a bullish catalyst. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the halving could reduce supply and potentially boost prices in the medium to long term. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Market Downturn: Actionable Insights So, what should crypto investors do amidst this uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin ? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Actionable Insight Description Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on market developments, economic news, and regulatory updates. Knowledge is your best weapon in navigating volatile markets. Manage Risk: Review your portfolio allocation and risk tolerance. Consider reducing exposure to riskier assets if you feel uncomfortable with the current market conditions. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, consider employing a dollar-cost averaging strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price, which can help mitigate the risk of buying high. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that crypto markets are cyclical. Focus on the long-term fundamentals and avoid making rash decisions based on short-term price swings. Seek Professional Advice: If you are unsure about how to navigate the current market conditions, consult with a qualified financial advisor who understands the crypto space. Conclusion: Weathering the Bitcoin Storm Bitcoin is indeed facing a challenging period, potentially marking its worst Q1 in years. The confluence of tariffs , economic uncertainties, and broader market jitters is creating a perfect storm. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile, and periods of market downturn are often followed by periods of recovery and growth. By staying informed, managing risk prudently, and maintaining a long-term perspective, crypto investors can navigate these turbulent times and position themselves for future opportunities in the ever-evolving world of digital assets. The BTC journey is rarely a smooth ride, and this Q1 may just be another test of resilience for the pioneering cryptocurrency.

""After major exchanges delisted XMR, we observed a significant increase in bitcoin inflows,"" Jardine said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""Reduced accessibility is steering users back toward bitcoin."" Many Western markets on the darknet — a part of the internet hosted within an encrypted network and accessible only through specialized anonymity-providing tools — had either fully moved to monero or operated with it in parallel with bitcoin before the delistings. XMR dropped off after it was removed from major exchanges. OKX removed XMR and other privacy-focused tokens including dash (DASH) and ZCash (ZCH) at the end of 2023. Binance announced in February 2024 that it planned to de-list monero. ""When a coin or token no longer meets this standard, or the industry changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it,"" Binance said at the time. On-chain data from BitInfoCharts shows that the daily number of monero transactions has halved from this time last year. ""In order to be an effective kind of medium of exchange, you need a certain amount of liquidity and a certain amount of accessibility,"" Jardine said. Jardine emphasized that illicit cryptocurrency transactions represent only a minor share of total crypto activity. ""Typically, illicit transactions constitute at or below 1% of total crypto activities. While addressing these issues is essential, broadly labeling crypto negatively is inaccurate and counterproductive."" Chainalysis data shows that about 0.14% of all transactions in crypto, some $50 billion, involve illicit activity, with a rise in stablecoins as an illicit payment mechanism. The stablecoin issuers are fighting back, with the Tron-led T3 Financial Crime Unit, a group comprising of Tron, USDT-issuer Tether and TRM Labs freezing over $100 million in illict funds. Jardine also noted that law-enforcement agencies prioritize darknet markets primarily based on their scale and involvement in the fentanyl trade. Its presence significantly escalates the likelihood of a darknet market attracting law enforcement attention, he said, because fighting the drug is a priority for international law enforcement. ""Markets have sort of varying levels of sensitivity to fentanyl-related sales,"" he said. ""Some claim they don't do it, then don't police vendors; some claim they don't do it, but then they do. Some will be selling precursor products but not finished products."" Indeed, one of the most recent darknet market busts was the Nemesis online market. The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) specifically cited the market's role in the fentanyl trade as a reason for the bust. And, as a result, OFAC sanctioned a number of crypto wallets tied to its operator, Behrouz Parsarad: 44 BTC addresses and 5 XMR wallets.",Markets|XMR|Monero|darknet|Privacy Coins,EN,0,0,XMR|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-31 11:45:11

But when a significant player like Gnome Labs makes a substantial BNB transfer , it’s time to pay attention. Just hours ago, blockchain data revealed a noteworthy transaction: Gnome Labs shifted a whopping 10,850 BNB, valued at $6.51 million, to the popular Bybit exchange. Let’s dive into what this could mean and why it’s causing a stir in the crypto community. Gnome Labs’ Mammoth BNB Transfer: What We Know According to the eagle-eyed crypto analysts at The Data Nerd, who cited Arkham data, this large BNB transfer occurred approximately three hours ago. This isn’t an isolated incident either. Data suggests that Gnome Labs has been actively moving assets, having transferred a substantial 76.37 million USDC to both Binance and Bybit over the past month. These movements raise several key questions: Scale of the Transaction: $6.51 million in a single crypto transaction is not a trivial amount. It signifies a potentially strategic move by Gnome Labs. Destination – Bybit Exchange: Why Bybit? Is it for trading, further investment, or something else entirely? Bybit is a well-known exchange, but the specific reason for choosing it in this instance is still unclear. Broader Pattern of Crypto Transactions: The fact that this BNB transfer is part of a larger pattern of USDC movements to Binance and Bybit suggests a deliberate strategy, not just random asset shuffling. Decoding Crypto Transactions: Why Do Whale Movements Matter? Large crypto transactions , especially those involving significant amounts of assets like BNB, are closely watched in the crypto space. These “whale” movements can offer clues about market sentiment and potential future price action. Here’s why these transactions are so important: Market Sentiment Indicator: Large transfers to exchanges can sometimes indicate an intention to sell, potentially leading to increased selling pressure and price drops. Conversely, transfers away from exchanges might suggest accumulation or long-term holding. Strategic Portfolio Adjustments: Entities like Gnome Labs manage vast crypto portfolios. These crypto transactions could be part of routine portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, or strategic shifts in investment focus. Liquidity and Trading Activity: Moving assets to exchanges increases the available liquidity for trading. This can impact market volatility and trading volumes, particularly for the specific cryptocurrency involved (in this case, BNB). Early Warning Signals: Monitoring these large crypto transactions can provide early warnings of potential market shifts or changes in the strategies of major crypto players. Bybit Exchange: A Crypto Hub for Big Moves Bybit, the recipient of this significant BNB transfer , is a prominent cryptocurrency exchange known for its derivatives trading, spot trading, and other crypto services. Why might Gnome Labs choose Bybit for such a large transaction? Factor Possible Reasons for Choosing Bybit Liquidity Bybit offers deep liquidity for BNB and various other cryptocurrencies, facilitating smooth and efficient trading of large volumes. Trading Platform Bybit is recognized for its robust trading platform, advanced order types, and features appealing to institutional and large-scale traders. Geographical Reach Bybit has a global presence, potentially aligning with Gnome Labs’ operational or strategic needs in different regions. Specific Services Bybit offers specific services or trading pairs that might be particularly attractive to Gnome Labs for their strategic objectives. Gnome Labs’ Crypto Portfolio: Beyond the BNB Transfer It’s crucial to consider this BNB transfer within the context of Gnome Labs’ broader crypto activity. The reported movement of 76.37 million USDC to Binance and Bybit over the last month adds another layer to the story. This combined activity could suggest: Diversification and Rebalancing: Gnome Labs might be rebalancing their portfolio, shifting funds between different cryptocurrencies and stablecoins like USDC. Preparation for Market Volatility: Moving USDC to exchanges could be a strategic move to have stablecoins readily available to capitalize on market dips or manage volatility. Operational Needs: These crypto transactions could simply be related to operational expenses, payouts, or other business-related financial activities of Gnome Labs. Navigating the Crypto Market: Actionable Insights from Whale Watching While we can’t definitively know Gnome Labs’ exact motivations, monitoring these types of crypto market analysis points and large transactions provides valuable insights for anyone involved in cryptocurrency: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on blockchain data and crypto news sources like The Data Nerd and Arkham. Tracking whale movements can offer early signals of potential market shifts. Context is Key: Don’t interpret a single BNB transfer in isolation. Look at the broader context – is it part of a larger pattern? What else is happening in the market? Manage Risk: Understand that large transactions can influence market dynamics. Be prepared for potential volatility and adjust your trading or investment strategies accordingly. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Use these insights as starting points for your own research. Don’t rely solely on whale movements, but incorporate them into your overall market analysis. Conclusion: Decoding Crypto Whale Moves for Market Edge The recent BNB transfer by Gnome Labs to Bybit is a compelling example of how on-chain data can offer a glimpse into the strategies of major crypto players. While the exact reasons behind these crypto transactions remain speculative, understanding their potential implications is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto market. By staying informed and analyzing these movements, you can gain a valuable edge in this dynamic and ever-evolving financial landscape.

This is 6% up from a similar survey in September 2023, indicating that interest is on an upward path despite market volatility and past exchange failures. Faith in Controlled Exchanges While uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies is still high—with at least 40% of respondents in all surveys uncertain about future crypto participation—trust in regulated platforms has increased. The survey discovered 20% more respondents feel at ease using regulated exchanges compared to unregulated ones, indicating that regulation and transparency are the drivers of increased adoption. Bitcoin Reigns Supreme as NFT Interest Fades Bitcoin is still the preferred option for potential investors, with more than 80% showing interest—a 7% boost from the first survey. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), however, have seen decreasing popularity, with interest dropping by 11%. Interest in Tokenized Money Low Despite growing interest in investment, knowledge of tokenized financial products is low. The survey states: 72% not aware of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) 65% not aware of the e-HKD 61% not aware of stablecoins 81% tokenized deposits This is indicative of a knowledge deficit since Hong Kong is still positioning itself as a crypto-friendly center.

42695472,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144629,1743422455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Insightful Look: Japan’s 2026 Crypto Reclassification Plan Unveiled,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japan-crypto-reclassification-2026/,"Get ready for a potential seismic shift in the crypto world! Japan, a nation known for its technological prowess and forward-thinking approach, is gearing up to redefine how it regulates cryptocurrencies. The country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is considering a landmark move that could reclassify cryptocurrencies as financial products. What does this mean for the future of digital assets, and why should you be paying attention? Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development. Decoding Japan’s Crypto Reclassification Initiative According to a recent report by Nikkei, highlighted by Decrypt, the FSA is planning to propose a significant change to its parliament by 2026. This proposal aims to reclassify cryptocurrencies, moving them from their current ambiguous status to recognized financial products . This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental shift in how Japan views and regulates the burgeoning world of digital currencies. The core of this initiative lies in modifying Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA). This act is the cornerstone of financial regulation in Japan, and by amending it, the FSA intends to clearly distinguish digital assets from traditional securities. While separating them from securities, the FSA also wants to formally acknowledge the inherent investment characteristics of cryptocurrencies. This dual approach is crucial for creating a regulatory framework that is both robust and adaptable to the unique nature of crypto. Why is Japan Considering This Transformative Change? Several factors are likely driving Japan’s move towards crypto reclassification . Here’s a breakdown: Investor Protection: As the crypto market matures, so does the need for stronger investor safeguards. Reclassifying cryptocurrencies as financial products would allow the FSA to apply existing investor protection measures, similar to those in place for stocks and bonds. This could include stricter disclosure requirements, enhanced security protocols for exchanges, and clearer guidelines for consumer rights. Market Clarity: The current regulatory landscape for crypto in many jurisdictions, including Japan, can be described as somewhat gray. Reclassification offers much-needed clarity. By defining cryptocurrencies within the FIEA framework, businesses and investors will gain a more transparent understanding of the rules of engagement. This clarity can foster innovation and attract more institutional investment. Global Alignment: International regulatory bodies are increasingly focusing on crypto assets. Japan’s move could be seen as an effort to align with emerging global standards and best practices. A clear and comprehensive regulatory framework enhances Japan’s standing as a responsible and forward-thinking player in the global financial arena. Economic Growth: Japan recognizes the economic potential of the crypto industry. By creating a well-regulated environment, the country aims to foster growth in this sector, attract crypto businesses, and potentially become a hub for digital asset innovation in Asia. What are the Potential Benefits of Crypto Reclassification? The proposed Japan crypto regulation overhaul could unlock several benefits for the crypto ecosystem and the broader economy: Increased Institutional Investment: Clarity in regulation often attracts larger, institutional investors who prefer a well-defined legal framework. Reclassification could pave the way for greater institutional participation in the Japanese crypto market, bringing in significant capital and maturity. Enhanced Consumer Trust: Stronger regulations build consumer confidence. Knowing that cryptocurrencies are subject to financial product regulations can reassure investors and encourage wider adoption among the general public. Innovation and Growth: A clear regulatory framework provides a stable foundation for businesses to innovate and grow. Crypto companies operating in Japan would have a clearer roadmap, encouraging investment in new technologies and services. Reduced Regulatory Arbitrage: Consistent and comprehensive regulations can minimize regulatory arbitrage, where businesses seek out jurisdictions with lax rules. A robust framework in Japan can contribute to a more level playing field globally. Challenges and Considerations Ahead While the potential benefits are significant, the path to crypto financial products reclassification is not without its challenges: Defining ‘Financial Product’: The precise definition of ‘financial product’ in the context of cryptocurrencies will be crucial. Regulators need to strike a balance between applying appropriate oversight and avoiding overly burdensome regulations that stifle innovation. Implementation Complexity: Amending the FIEA and implementing new regulations is a complex process. It requires careful consideration of various aspects, including technological nuances, market dynamics, and international standards. Industry Consultation: Effective regulation requires close collaboration with the crypto industry. The FSA’s plan for private consultations with experts is a positive step. Ongoing dialogue with industry stakeholders will be essential to ensure that the regulations are practical and effective. Enforcement and Compliance: Once the new regulations are in place, effective enforcement will be key. The FSA will need to develop the capacity and resources to monitor compliance and address any violations. Roadmap to 2026: What to Expect? The FSA is aiming to propose this legislation to the parliament as early as 2026. This timeline suggests a phased approach involving: Expert Consultations: The FSA is currently in the phase of private consultations with experts to refine the proposed changes. This stage is critical for gathering diverse perspectives and ensuring a well-informed regulatory framework. Legislative Drafting: Following consultations, the FSA will draft the specific amendments to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. This will involve legal and technical expertise to translate the policy objectives into concrete legal language. Parliamentary Approval: The drafted legislation will then be presented to the Japanese parliament for debate and approval. This process can take time and may involve revisions based on parliamentary discussions. Implementation and Enforcement: Once approved, there will be a period for implementation, including the development of detailed guidelines and enforcement mechanisms. The FSA will likely work with the industry to ensure a smooth transition to the new regulatory regime. The Global Impact of Japan’s Crypto Policy Shift Japan’s move to reclassify cryptocurrencies as digital assets Japan is watching closely could have ripple effects globally. As one of the world’s major economies and a significant player in the crypto space, Japan’s regulatory decisions often influence other jurisdictions. If Japan successfully implements a clear and effective framework for crypto financial products, it could set a precedent for other countries grappling with similar regulatory challenges. Furthermore, it could boost international confidence in the crypto market as a whole. A well-regulated crypto sector in Japan could attract global investment and foster greater collaboration among nations on crypto regulation. This is particularly relevant as international bodies like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are increasingly emphasizing the need for global coordination in crypto regulation. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you are a crypto investor, a business operating in the crypto space, or simply someone interested in the future of finance, Japan’s FSA crypto policy shift is something to watch closely. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in Japanese crypto regulation. Follow news outlets specializing in crypto and financial regulation for updates on the FSA’s proposals and timelines. Assess Market Opportunities: If you are a crypto business, consider the potential opportunities that a clearer regulatory environment in Japan could offer. This could be a strategic location for expansion or new ventures. Understand Regulatory Trends: Japan’s approach could signal broader trends in global crypto regulation. Analyze the specifics of Japan’s proposed framework to anticipate potential regulatory changes in other jurisdictions. Engage in Dialogue: If you are part of the crypto industry, consider engaging in discussions with regulatory bodies and industry associations. Your input can help shape effective and balanced regulations. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Crypto Regulation in Japan? Japan’s move to potentially reclassify cryptocurrencies as financial products by 2026 marks a potentially transformative moment for the crypto industry. This initiative, driven by the FSA, reflects a proactive approach to creating a robust and investor-friendly regulatory environment. While challenges remain, the potential benefits – from increased institutional investment to enhanced consumer trust – are substantial. As Japan moves forward with its plan, the world will be watching, learning, and perhaps, following suit. This could indeed be the dawn of a new era for crypto regulation, not just in Japan, but globally.

Optimism on US President Donald Trump’s re-election and expectations of a pro-crypto policy, quickly gave way to textbook “sell-the-news” trading as tangible regulatory changes have failed to materialise. Since it’s all-time high, Bitcoin has traded as far down as $77,041, a near 29 percent drop , and has largely oscillated in a trading range between $78,000 and $88,000. Bitcoin Dominance vs Total Crypto Market Capitalisation Market breadth, however, continues to favour Bitcoin, with BTC dominance rising to over 61 percent even as the total crypto market cap declined sharply—signalling capital rotation from riskier altcoins into Bitcoin during heightened macro uncertainty. Ethereum and Solana and other altcoins have fallen by more than 35-50 percent from their cycle highs, reinforcing Bitcoin’s status as the reserve asset of the digital market. As Q2 begins, price action remains reactive to macroeconomic signals, with Fed policy and ETF flows expected to dictate direction. For now, signs of capitulation have eased, but with liquidity still tight, a breakout will likely require a significant catalyst. In terms of the macro picture, some parts of the US economy are showing signs of resilience—such as a narrowing trade deficit and a rise in durable goods spending—but these bright spots are overshadowed by deeper structural concerns. Inflation is accelerating faster than expected, fuelled in part by rising import costs tied to new tariffs. Core inflation rose 0.4 percent in February, marking its sharpest monthly gain in over a year, while consumer expectations suggest inflation could stay elevated well into the future. Disposable Personal Income, Outlays and Saving (Source: US Bureau of Economic Analysis) At the same time, growth is slowing. Real income gains remain tepid once government transfers are excluded , and services spending—a key economic driver—has begun to contract. Consumer confidence is eroding, with the Conference Board index falling to a two-year low and more Americans anticipating rising unemployment. These trends point to growing caution among households, reflected in a rising personal savings rate . Trade policy remains a central pressure point . Recent tariff hikes and expectations of further measures in April and May are prompting businesses and consumers to adjust behaviour, front-loading purchases, delaying investments, or scaling back hiring. While the February trade deficit narrowed , this followed a January import surge that likely distorted GDP forecasts. As a result, first-quarter growth is expected to slow sharply. Despite these ongoing economic uncertainties, the broader cryptocurrency industry is still benefiting from the increasing commitment to regulatory clarity, underpinned by political support, and growing institutional interest. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially dropped its lawsuits against Kraken, Consensys, and Cumberland DRW—three major players in the industry. This move signals a significant shift from the agency’s previous enforcement-heavy stance to a more collaborative regulatory approach. It also foreshadows a commitment to establishing clear, constructive rules for the industry. Further solidifying this direction, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force announced four upcoming roundtables to be held between April and June 2025. These sessions will engage stakeholders on key issues such as crypto trading regulation, custody of digital assets, tokenisation, and the future of decentralised finance (DeFi). The events are open to the public and reflect the SEC’s intent to foster open dialogue and transparency in shaping crypto policy. In parallel, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) has announced a high-profile partnership with Crypto.com to launch a series of crypto-focused ETFs. This venture marks TMTG’s expansion into financial products, aiming to tap into the growing demand for digital asset investment vehicles. While the initiative still awaits regulatory approval, it could significantly boost the visibility of both TMTG and Crypto.com within traditional finance circles.

42695893,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144626,1743423059,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exclusive: Movement Labs Clarifies Massive MOVE Token Coinbase Deposit – Is a Crypto Loan Incoming?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/move-token-coinbase-deposit-loan/,"In a surprising turn of events that caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts and market analysts alike, blockchain firm Movement Labs recently deposited a substantial 17.15 million MOVE tokens, valued at $7.74 million, into the prominent Coinbase exchange. This significant Coinbase deposit immediately sparked speculation about a potential large-scale sale or transfer of these tokens. However, Rushi Manche, the co-founder of Movement Labs, quickly stepped in to clarify the situation, taking to social media platform X to set the record straight. What exactly is behind this intriguing move, and what does it mean for the future of MOVE and Movement Labs? Decoding the Coinbase Deposit: Not a Sale, But a Strategic Move Addressing the swirling rumors and assumptions, Manche explicitly stated that the Coinbase deposit was “not intended for sale or transfer.” This straightforward denial immediately quelled concerns among MOVE token holders and the wider crypto community who might have feared a potential price dip due to a large sell-off. Instead, Manche revealed the deposit serves a much more strategic purpose: it’s connected to the launch of an upcoming institutional product from Movement Labs and a corresponding crypto loan . This revelation offers a fascinating glimpse into the evolving strategies within the cryptocurrency space. Instead of simply listing tokens for public trading, Movement Labs is leveraging Coinbase’s institutional infrastructure to facilitate a more complex financial maneuver. Let’s break down what we know: Purpose-Driven Deposit: The 17.15 million MOVE token deposit is specifically for an upcoming institutional product and associated loan, not for open market sales. Strategic Finance: Movement Labs is utilizing a crypto loan mechanism, likely secured by the deposited MOVE tokens, to fund or facilitate the launch of their new institutional product . Clarity from the Top: Co-founder Rushi Manche’s direct communication via X highlights the importance of transparency in the fast-paced crypto world, directly addressing community concerns. What is This ‘Institutional Product’ and Why a Crypto Loan? While details about the exact nature of the institutional product remain under wraps, the term itself suggests that Movement Labs is targeting larger financial players, investment firms, or other institutions rather than individual retail investors. This pivot towards institutional clients is a growing trend in the crypto industry, reflecting the increasing maturity and acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance. The decision to utilize a crypto loan in conjunction with this product launch also raises interesting questions. Why opt for a loan instead of other funding methods? Here are some potential benefits and considerations: Benefit Explanation Capital Efficiency A loan allows Movement Labs to access capital without selling their MOVE tokens, potentially preserving their long-term value and avoiding dilution. Strategic Flexibility Loan terms can be structured to align with the product launch timeline and anticipated revenue streams. Institutional Alignment Using established financial instruments like loans can make the product more appealing and familiar to institutional investors. Potential for Growth The capital from the crypto loan can be strategically deployed to accelerate product development, marketing, and overall growth initiatives. Movement Labs and the MOVE Token: A Quick Overview For those less familiar, Movement Labs is a blockchain firm focused on building innovative solutions within the crypto space. The MOVE token is the native cryptocurrency of their ecosystem, likely playing a crucial role in the functionality and utility of their products, including this upcoming institutional product . Understanding the context of Movement Labs and MOVE is crucial to grasping the significance of this Coinbase deposit and strategic financial maneuvering. The fact that Movement Labs is engaging with Coinbase for institutional-level activities underscores the exchange’s growing role beyond retail trading. Coinbase has been actively expanding its services to cater to institutional clients, recognizing the increasing demand from larger players to participate in the crypto market. This Coinbase deposit could be seen as another example of this trend in action. Actionable Insights and What to Watch For So, what can we learn from this situation, and what should crypto enthusiasts and investors keep an eye on? Institutional Adoption is Key: This event highlights the increasing institutionalization of crypto. Watch for more projects and exchanges focusing on institutional-grade products and services. Strategic Token Utilization: Projects are becoming more sophisticated in how they utilize their native tokens beyond just fundraising or exchange listings. Pay attention to innovative financial strategies like crypto loans and institutional partnerships. Transparency Matters: Rushi Manche’s proactive communication is a positive example. Follow project leaders and official channels for timely and accurate information, especially during periods of market speculation. MOVE Token and Movement Labs Development: Keep an eye on Movement Labs’ announcements regarding their new institutional product . Its success could significantly impact the utility and value of the MOVE token. A Bold Move or Calculated Risk? Movement Labs’ strategic Coinbase deposit and planned crypto loan represent a potentially groundbreaking approach to launching institutional products in the crypto space. By clarifying their intentions and focusing on institutional finance, they are signaling a mature and calculated approach to growth. While the specifics of the institutional product remain a secret for now, the market will be keenly observing the outcomes of this bold initiative. This move could set a new precedent for how crypto projects engage with institutional investors and utilize their token reserves for strategic financial operations.

Latest reports show that investors of Shiba Inu now hope towards a new token called Remittix . The majority of analysts report that Remittix can potentially go 20x in April alone. It is promoted as a new DeFi project that has a real solution for day-to-day problems. Its low and humble DeFi coin price is currently for investors seeking long-term growth. This has made many investors rethink their portfolios. Shiba Inu Price: A Token with Volatility SHIB has quite often experienced price volatility. Shiba Inu price recently experienced a drop of just 1% in the last 24 hours alone. Certain technical charts have SHIB in downtrend and may take a very long time to recover. The investors refer to some Shiba Inu price predictions that state worse turbulence on the horizon. The token’s high supply and market mood make it prone to price volatility. Most watchers of the Shiba Inu price anticipate a turn-around, but current momentum indicates otherwise. Despite the reality that the coin still enjoys strong community backing, it cannot exhibit stability in the long term. Analysts say with no clear gains in network efficiency on the horizon, SHIB may continue to struggle. SHIB will drop by 2.19% and hit $0.00001268 by April 25. Remittix Revolutionizes Cross-Border Money Transfers Cross-border remittances in the long run have been marked by slow processes with burdensome charges. Customers have to face delays in their daily financial requirements. The existing high velocity of the new world demands solutions that offer speed and low costs and traditional approaches fail to meet this. A new system within Remittix makes it easier for users to handle their transactions. The token price of $0.0734 has assisted the project in raising $14.2 million from the sale of 524 million tokens. These financial statistics indicate that users highly prefer this new solution and its development is still growing. All transactions done on Remittix are governed by an incorruptible blockchain ledger that provides end-to-end transaction security and transparency. Digital wallets in this scenario provide access to direct bank accounts and local cash pick-up points avoiding traditional payment intermediaries. Remittix achieves day-to-day usage through minimizing steps and decreasing fees which is beneficial to migrant laborers and small business people and families in need of speedy money transfers.

This time, the company purchased 22,048 BTC for $1.92 billion, bringing its total holdings to 528,185.

Tokenomist data shows these releases are split between single “cliff” one-time releases and regular “linear” releases distributed across various blockchain projects. Cliff unlocks are led by SUI SUI leads this week’s cliff unlocks with 64.19 million tokens valued at $148.93 million set to be released. This unlock represents 2.14% of SUI’s supply. Second in terms of value is the W token, which will release an enormous 1.39 billion tokens valued at $118.12 million. This unlock represents 46.27% of W’s unlock supply and is among the biggest percentage increases of major tokens this week. ENA takes the third spot with 212.50 million tokens worth $78.81 million (4.02% of unlock supply). This is then followed by OP with 31.34 million tokens worth $23.40 million (2.11% of unlock supply). BIGTIME will unlock 333.33 million tokens worth $16.36 million, which is 26.96% of its unlock supply. Large token cliff and linear unlocks in the week between March 31 and April 7. Source: Wu Blockchain Some of the other significant cliff unlocks apart from SUI are ZETA (44.26 million tokens, $13.35 million, 6.20% of supply), KAS (153.24 million tokens, $9.90 million, 0.59% of supply), NEON (53.91 million tokens, $6.79 million, 7.44% of supply), and DYDX (8.33 million tokens, $5.36 million, 1.30% of supply). The varying percentages of supply being unlocked suggest different potential market impacts across these tokens. As per the data, W and BIGTIME face the largest proportional increases in circulating supply at 46.27% and 26.96%, respectively. Solana leads linear unlocks Solana (SOL) remains at the top of the linear unlock space. According to the data, 465,770 SOL tokens worth $58.80 million are set for release over a period of time in the coming week. In spite of this large dollar amount, the unlock represents only 0.09% of the circulating supply of SOL. Coming in second to SOL in the linear unlock category is Worldcoin (WLD), which will distribute 37.23 million tokens valued at approximately $29.22 million. This distribution represents 3.06% of WLD’s circulating supply. TIA comes in third with 6.96 million tokens valued at $22.69 million, representing 1.20% of its circulating supply. A number of other top cryptocurrencies will also have linear unlocks throughout this time. Optimism (OM) will unlock 2.65 million tokens valued at $16.46 million (0.27% of supply), and meme favorite Dogecoin (DOGE) will have 96.52 million tokens valued at $15.84 million unlocked. Avalanche (AVAX) will release 700,000 tokens worth $13.22 million (0.17% of supply), and TAO will unlock 50.40K tokens worth $11.38 million (0.60% of supply). There are smaller linear unlocks such as IP ($11.97 million), JTO ($9.38 million), SUI ($8.63 million), DOT ($9.32 million), NEAR ($7.68 million), and FIL ($7.10 million). Interestingly enough, SUI is listed under both cliff and linear unlock types, with the total combined releases exceeding $157 million. The two unlock types have varying vesting schedules for different token allocations. Linear unlocks typically create less immediate market pressure than cliff unlocks. This is because tokens are gradually released over time rather than becoming available all at once. Less popular token unlocks Beyond the headline-grabbing unlocks from major tokens, several smaller cryptocurrency projects are also releasing substantial portions of their token supply this week as per CoinMarketCap data. GUNZ will unlock 604.5 million GUN tokens, though the token currently shows no price or market capitalization data. With no active trading yet visible, this initial distribution may establish baseline market conditions for the token. Token unlock and vesting schedules. Source: CoinMarketCap Shockwaves (NEUROS) is also ahead in its unlock plan at 72.13% done. The token has a future release of 1.89 million NEUROS tokens equating to about $12,083.78. This comparatively small unlock accounts for 1.89% of the total locked supply for a token trading at $0.006382 currently. Hooked Protocol (HOOK) is near the mid-point of its unlock process with 47.33% of the process complete. The impending release will unlock 8.33 million HOOK tokens worth $1.05 million. The AC Milan Fan Token (ACM) has surpassed 52.79% of its unlock schedule. It will unlock 205,263 ACM tokens representing approximately $190,467 soon. This is equivalent to 1.03% of locked tokens for a project currently valued at $0.9279 per token. MAXX AI (MXM) has completed 33.70% of its unlock process, and 19.71 million MXM tokens worth $32,019.42 are available for release. The smaller unlocks may then be subject to more pronounced price effects in relation to their size in the marketplace.

While Vanguard has publicly expressed skepticism towards crypto, their significant investment in GameStop, the video game retailer, could inadvertently lead to Vanguard Bitcoin exposure . Let’s dive into how this intriguing situation is unfolding and what it could mean for the broader landscape of institutional crypto adoption. Unveiling Vanguard’s Indirect Bitcoin Exposure via GameStop The narrative takes an interesting twist as GameStop, a company once at the heart of a meme stock frenzy, is now venturing into the realm of digital assets. Last week, GameStop’s board gave the green light to a strategic plan that includes holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset. This means GameStop could potentially allocate a portion of its cash reserves, and even future financing, to purchase Bitcoin. This bold move by GameStop is where Vanguard’s indirect Bitcoin exposure comes into play. As a major shareholder in GameStop, Vanguard’s portfolio is now, in a way, tethered to GameStop’s Bitcoin strategy. Here’s a breakdown of the key points to understand this developing situation: GameStop Embraces Bitcoin: GameStop’s decision to add Bitcoin to its treasury reserves marks a significant shift for the company and signals a growing acceptance of digital assets in the corporate world. Vanguard’s Stake in GameStop: As a substantial investor in GameStop, Vanguard’s financial performance is linked to GameStop’s success and strategic decisions, including this foray into Bitcoin. Indirect Exposure, Not Direct Investment: It’s crucial to note that Vanguard isn’t directly investing in Bitcoin. Their exposure is indirect, stemming from their investment in a company that is now choosing to hold Bitcoin. Vanguard’s Stance on Crypto: Vanguard has historically been wary of cryptocurrencies. As Janel Jackson, former global head of ETF Capital Markets at Vanguard, stated last year, they didn’t believe crypto had a place in long-term portfolios. This indirect exposure is therefore quite a noteworthy development. Why is GameStop Betting on Bitcoin? GameStop’s pivot to include GameStop Bitcoin on its balance sheet raises several questions. What’s driving this decision? Here are a few potential reasons: Diversification of Treasury Assets: Companies often diversify their treasury holdings to mitigate risk and potentially enhance returns. Bitcoin, as a non-correlated asset, could be seen as a way to diversify away from traditional assets. Future-Proofing the Business: In a rapidly evolving digital world, embracing digital assets like Bitcoin could be seen as a move to future-proof GameStop’s business and appeal to a tech-savvy customer base. Capitalizing on Bitcoin’s Potential: GameStop might believe in the long-term growth potential of Bitcoin and see it as an investment opportunity to grow their assets. Following Market Trends: With more and more companies and even countries exploring Bitcoin, GameStop might be aligning itself with a broader trend of digital asset adoption. Institutional Crypto Investment: A Paradigm Shift? GameStop’s move, and consequently Vanguard’s indirect involvement, occurs within a larger context of growing institutional crypto investment . For years, institutional investors were largely on the sidelines when it came to cryptocurrencies. Concerns about volatility, regulation, and understanding the technology kept many at bay. However, the tide seems to be turning. Factors driving increased institutional interest in crypto include: Factor Description Maturing Market The cryptocurrency market is becoming more mature with increased liquidity, better infrastructure, and more regulated exchanges. Inflation Concerns Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against inflation, attracting investors seeking to preserve capital. Growing Adoption Increased adoption by corporations, payment processors, and even nation-states is lending legitimacy to the crypto space. Potential for High Returns Despite volatility, the potential for high returns in the crypto market remains a significant draw for institutional investors. While Vanguard itself may not be ready to directly embrace Bitcoin, this indirect exposure through GameStop could subtly shift their perspective over time. It’s a fascinating case study in how even traditional financial institutions are becoming entangled with the crypto world, even if unintentionally at first. Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset: A New Corporate Strategy GameStop’s decision to adopt Bitcoin treasury management is part of a growing trend. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have already made headlines by adding Bitcoin to their corporate treasuries. This strategy, while still relatively new, presents both potential benefits and challenges for corporations. Potential Benefits of Bitcoin Treasury: Enhanced Returns: Bitcoin’s potential for price appreciation could lead to significant gains on corporate balance sheets. Diversification: Bitcoin offers diversification benefits due to its low correlation with traditional assets. Innovation Signaling: Adopting Bitcoin can signal a company’s innovative and forward-thinking approach. Hedge Against Inflation: Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflationary pressures, preserving the value of corporate reserves. Potential Challenges of Bitcoin Treasury: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility can introduce significant fluctuations in corporate balance sheets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, creating uncertainty for corporations. Accounting and Tax Complexity: Accounting for and taxing Bitcoin holdings can be complex and require specialized expertise. Security Risks: Storing and securing Bitcoin holdings requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. The Future of Crypto Adoption: Will Vanguard Follow Suit? The unfolding situation with Vanguard and GameStop raises a crucial question: Will this indirect crypto adoption eventually lead to a change in Vanguard’s official stance on cryptocurrencies? It’s too early to say for sure, but here are a few possible scenarios: No Immediate Change: Vanguard might maintain its current stance, viewing this as an isolated case related to GameStop and not a reflection of their own investment strategy. Gradual Shift in Perspective: As Vanguard observes GameStop’s Bitcoin strategy and the broader institutional crypto landscape, their internal views might gradually evolve. They might start exploring crypto in more detail, even if direct investment remains off the table for now. Indirect Crypto Products: Vanguard could potentially consider offering indirect crypto products, such as ETFs that invest in companies with Bitcoin exposure, without directly holding Bitcoin themselves. This could be a way to cater to client demand while staying within their comfort zone. Eventual Direct Involvement: While less likely in the near term, if the regulatory environment becomes clearer and institutional crypto adoption continues to grow, Vanguard might eventually reconsider its direct involvement in the crypto market. The GameStop-Vanguard situation is a microcosm of the broader tension between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto world. It highlights how even institutions hesitant about crypto are finding themselves, sometimes unexpectedly, connected to this revolutionary asset class. Conclusion: A Quiet Revolution in Institutional Finance? Vanguard’s potential indirect exposure to Bitcoin through GameStop is more than just a quirky financial footnote. It represents a subtle yet significant shift in the narrative surrounding institutional crypto investment . While Vanguard may not be intentionally embracing Bitcoin, this situation underscores the increasing pervasiveness of crypto within the financial ecosystem. As more companies explore Bitcoin treasury strategies and institutional interest continues to grow, even the most traditional players may find it harder to remain completely on the sidelines. The journey of institutional crypto adoption is unfolding in unexpected ways, and Vanguard’s GameStop connection is a compelling example of this quiet revolution.

The coin has crashed for five days, erasing most gains made earlier this month, and moving to its March 14 low. Fundamentals, including the rising number of holders, and its technicals point to a big surge. Shiba Inu Price Could Rise as Holders Reach 1.5 Million On-chain data show that the number of Shiba Inu coin holders has continued rising even as the coin crashed from $0.00003341 to $0.00001200. Data shows that the number of SHIB holders has crossed the important 1.5 million milestone, making it one of the most held coins in the market. This growth is mostly because Shiba Inu has some of the best fundamentals in the meme coin industry. It is highly deflationary, with the number of SHIB coins in circulation being 584 trillion, down from 999 trillion since its inception. The SHIB burb rate jumped by 750% on Monday to 17.1 million. Just last week, two SHIB holders burned 1 billion SHIB tokens in separate transactions. Token burns help to boost a coin value by making the remaining ones rarer. Shiba Inu also unveiled Shibarium, a layer-2 network whose transactions are nearing 1 billion, and the number of addresses has soared to 193.5 million . Recent data shows that the total value locked in Shibarium has soared by over 20% in the 30 days. Shibarium Stats SHIB Price Signal Points to a Surge The daily chart paints a gloomy picture of the SHIB price. It peaked at $0.00003341 in December and has now plunged by over 63%. Its attempts to recover have faced substantial resistance, with the most recent one being at $0.00001565, where it formed a shooting star candlestick, a popular bearish sign. However, a closer inspection shows that the Shiba Inu price has formed some bullish patterns that point to an eventual recovery. It formed a falling wedge pattern between November and mid-March this month. SHIB moved slightly above the upper side of the wedge pattern and reached a high of $0.00001566. The recent drop, therefore, is likely part of the break-and-retest pattern, where an asset retests a key level. In this case, it wants to retest the upper line of this wedge. Most notably, Shiba Inu price is at a key level where it has failed to move below since July last year. That is a sign that it has formed a quadruple bottom whose neckline is at $0.00003340. Shiba Inu Price Chart Therefore, the coin will likely bounce back as bulls target last December’s high of $0.00003340, up by 175% above the current level. A drop below the key support at $0.00001080 will invalidate the bullish Shiba Inu forecast .

DOGE falls alongside other memecoins The bearish sentiment was not only exclusive to Dogecoin as most other memecoins recorded significant losses across the board. Key takeaways: Shiba Inu ( SHIB ), the second largest memecoin by market capitalization, was down 4.2% over the last 24 hours to trade at $0.00001206. Ethereum-based Pepe ( PEPE ) has dropped by 1.7% over the same period. 24-hour performance of top-cap memecoins : Source: CoinMarketCap Solana-based Fartcoin (FARTCOIN) posted the most losses among the top-cap memecoins, dropping by 8% on March 31 to exchange hands at $0.4146. The total daily trading volume across the memecoin sector is down by 48% over the last 30 days, indicating the lack of trader interest. Memecoin market capitalization and weekly trading volume.

This has spooked investors, pushing them away from volatile assets like memecoins. US government has “no plans” to use Dogecoin - Elon Musk One of the most significant catalysts for DOGE’s underperformance today is a statement from Elon Musk, a prominent figure whose influence on Dogecoin’s value is well-known. Related: Elon Musk and crypto: 6 times ‘Dogecoin’s CEO’ rocked markets What you should know: Musk, who leads the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.) under the Trump administration, clarified that the US government has “no plans” to integrate Dogecoin into its operations. At a March 30 town hall in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Musk sought to distinguish the federal agency from the leading memecoin despite their shared acronym. “There are no plans for the government to use Dogecoin or anything as far as I know,” he said. “They happen to be similar names, but really, we’re literally just trying to make the government 15% more efficient.” Many had hoped that Musk’s proximity to government policy might lead to official adoption or recognition of the memecoin, especially given his role in a high-profile efficiency initiative. Musk explained that the name originated from suggestions made online. “I was going to call it the Government Efficiency Commission, but that’s a super boring name,” he said. “Then the internet said it needs to be the Department of Government Efficiency. I was like, ‘The internet is right.’” Musk’s clarification effectively punctured a narrative that fueled speculative buying, contributing directly to the downward pressure on DOGE’s price. DOGE price validates bear flag pattern DOGE has confirmed a bear flag pattern on the daily chart after closing below the lower boundary of the flag at $0.1773. Key levels to watch: DOGE is currently testing the support level at $0.160 after flipping the flag’s lower trendline into resistance. Key support levels include the $0.1427 range low (reached on March 11) and the range low at $0.1275 (reached on Oct. 25, 2024). A high volume move below these levels could lead to even more downside. The maximum loss target from the pole’s length indicates that DOGE could revisit the $0.0876 zone over the next few days. This would represent another 42% descent from the current level.

Source: Cointelegraph/TradingView The relative strength index (RSI) has dropped from 52 to 38 since March 26, indicating increasing bearish momentum. “Dogecoin exhibits bearish momentum,” said crypto analyst Andrew Griffiths in a March 31 post on X. “The price is likely to stabilize below the pivot line at 0.1774, paving the way for potential declines to 0.1478 and 0.1283,” the analyst continued, adding: “A daily close below 0.1283 would signal a continued bearish trend toward 0.0850.” DOGE/USD 12-hour chart.

Blink, and suddenly a random animal mascot is sitting on a $100 million market cap. From quirky tokens to full-blown crypto communities, this sector is rewriting what it means to go viral—and cash in. In 2025, the hype hasn’t cooled off; it’s only getting hotter. Right now, BTFD Coin is fueling that fire. It’s deep into its meme coin presale, and things are heating up fast. With over $6.44 million raised, more than 72 billion tokens sold, and only one stage left before launch, this presale’s final hours are dripping with FOMO. Analysts are throwing around words like “2900% ROI”, and with a current price of $0.0002, that projection isn’t just clickbait—it’s math. Below are the four best new meme coins with 1000X potential , starting with the one that’s making bulls go full send. BTFD Coin: The Presale That’s Turning Heads and Doubling Bags The bull stampede is in full swing—and BTFD Coin is leading the charge with numbers that speak for themselves. Sitting in Stage 15 at just $0.0002, this presale started at $0.000004 and is expected to list at $0.0006. But here’s where it gets wild: if it hits its projected $0.006 moon price, that’s a massive 2900% ROI. With over 11,600 holders, the coin is flying off the digital shelves. Now let’s talk cash. If someone drops $7,000 into BTFD right now, they’ll grab 35 million tokens at the presale price. At the listing price of $0.0006, that becomes $21,000. And if it hits the moon target of $0.006? That turns into $210,000. Wild? Yes. Impossible? Not even close. Beyond just numbers, the energy around BTFD is electric. Its Bulls Squad community is buzzing on every platform, hyping daily updates, staking strategies, and their love for the live Play-to-Earn game that went live on January 1, 2025. Oh, and don’t forget the staking rewards—a juicy 90% APY for those locking in their tokens early. But the real engine right now? This presale’s insane traction paired with analyst predictions calling it the next 1000X meme coin to explode. And here’s the part that can’t wait: LAUNCH100, the 100% bonus code, EXPIRES TODAY—March 30th. When used during checkout, every token you buy gets doubled. That $7,000? It now grabs 70 million tokens instead of 35 million. But only if you apply LAUNCH100 before it disappears with the presale. Wondering how to get in? It’s simple. Set up a wallet with MetaMask or Trust Wallet and load it with BNB, ETH, or USDT. Go to the presale page , connect your wallet, enter LAUNCH100 (yes, in ALL CAPS), select your amount, confirm the buy, and boom—you’re now holding BTFD. Tokens will be claimable post-presale, with staking and game rewards available as per the project’s vesting timeline. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because BTFD Coin is the only project here with a live meme coin presale , a community over 11,600 bulls strong, and a shot at 2900% ROI. The presale is nearly over—and missing it could be one of those moments you don’t forget. COQ Inu: A Meme Token With Real Infrastructure While most meme coins stick to vibes and viral trends, COQ Inu comes packed with an actual ecosystem. Built on Avalanche, COQ Inu isn’t just a token—it’s a platform. The project offers a DEX aggregator, DeFi tools, a wallet, and even NFT and gaming layers that give holders more than just internet bragging rights. This multi-utility approach has helped COQ Inu carve out a unique space in the meme coin scene. It appeals to those who love memes but still want a deeper play. And thanks to Avalanche’s blazing speed and low fees, users can dive into its tools without needing a tech degree or a second mortgage on gas fees. COQ Inu has steadily grown its user base through transparency, community interaction, and regular dev updates. There’s a future here beyond speculation, and that future is pulling in crypto lovers who want both fun and functionality in the same bag. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because COQ Inu blends the best of both worlds—meme coin energy with real infrastructure. It’s easily one of the best new meme coins with 1000X potential for investors who love utility wrapped in humor. SLERF: Pure Meme Energy, Solana Style Sometimes, all a coin needs is a funny name, some solid community energy, and a home on the right chain. That’s SLERF in a nutshell. This meme coin lives on the Solana blockchain, and it thrives purely off its fast-growing following and the high-speed, low-fee capabilities of Solana’s ecosystem. What makes SLERF interesting is that it’s not trying to be everything. It embraces its meme identity and focuses hard on building trading volume, social presence, and good vibes. It’s quickly become a fan favorite among meme coin degens who know a good coin flip when they see one. As Solana continues to rise in 2025, SLERF could ride the wave of broader adoption. Its straightforward branding, commitment to community memes, and simplicity are turning it into a recognizable name across meme coin Twitter and Telegram chats. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because SLERF embraces the meme coin chaos with confidence and clarity. For those chasing the best new meme coins with 1000X potential, this one brings Solana speed and social buzz in equal measure. Bone ShibaSwap: The DAO-Powered Meme Giant BONE is the governance token for ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange within the Shiba ecosystem. But it’s more than just governance—it’s a powerhouse for staking, voting through Doggy DAO, and being part of one of the largest meme ecosystems in crypto history. Holders of BONE can shape the direction of the ShibaSwap platform, propose ideas, and help implement major updates. It’s a utility-driven token that still holds its meme DNA through the wider Shiba Inu branding and global recognition. In 2025, the DAO concept continues to gain traction, and tokens like BONE are capitalizing on that momentum. The team behind ShibaSwap keeps refining its tools, which helps BONE maintain its relevance even as new meme tokens flood the market. Why did this coin make it to this list? Because Bone ShibaSwap sits at the intersection of governance and meme culture, making it one of the best new meme coins with 1000X potential for those who want a voice in a massive DeFi platform. The Final Words The meme coin market is pumping harder than ever—and it’s showing no signs of slowing down. While projects like COQ Inu, SLERF, and BONE each bring unique flavor to the table, there’s one coin that has the entire crypto space watching: BTFD Coin. With its presale wrapping up, the $0.0002 entry, and a projected listing price of $0.0006, it’s a ticking clock for anyone looking to make serious moves. But it’s not just about price—this project is packing a live game, 90% APY staking, and a community-led Bulls Squad that’s growing louder by the hour. And with LAUNCH100 expiring today, there’s no room left for hesitation. Join the BTFD Coin presale now . Secure your 2x tokens, stake early, and ride the bull into launch. FAQs What is the current stage and price of BTFD Coin? BTFD Coin is in Stage 15 of its presale at a price of $0.0002 per token. When does the LAUNCH100 bonus expire? The LAUNCH100 100% bonus code expires March 30, 2025. It must be used in ALL CAPS during purchase to receive 2x tokens. How much can I earn by investing $7,000 in BTFD Coin at $0.0002? At the $0.0006 listing price, you could earn $21,000. If the token hits $0.006, your investment could be worth $210,000. Is BTFD Coin the only meme coin presale in this list? Yes, BTFD Coin is the only project currently in its meme coin presale, making it a unique opportunity among the four.

According to a March 31 announcement , X2Y2 will shut down on April 30, with the team switching its focus to an artificial intelligence project. The team shared its enthusiasm for the rapidly growing sector: “It’s a pivot. Over the last 12 months, we’ve been diving deep into AI—hands down the biggest paradigm shift we’ll see in our lifetimes—and how it can transform crypto. We’re building something new.“ Token Terminal data shows that X2Y2 saw $53.6 million worth of trading volume over the last 365 days. While this is a far cry from market leader Blur with its $3 billion worth of trading volume, it still awards the protocol fourth place behind Blur, OpenSea and Immutable. X2Y2 365-day trading volume chart. Source: Token Terminal Charu Sethi, president at NFT-focused Polkadot and Kusama chain Unique Network, said the decision is not a sign of decline in the NFT market. She told Cointelegraph: “The speculative phase focused on collectibles and trading is over, but NFTs are now entering their next growth era as core infrastructure enabling massive opportunities in gaming, AI, fan engagement and content authentication. “ Related: The ABCD of AI: Automation, big data, computer vision and deep learning Real-world implementation is key Sethi highlighted initiatives such as Mythical Games issuing large numbers of NFTs on Polkadot meant for in-game integration following a $75 million fundraise in 2021 . She also pointed out a DappRadar report showing that the blockchain gaming sector reached 7.4 million daily unique active wallets in 2024. According to Sethi, “X2Y2’s experience highlights that NFT platforms cannot rely solely on marketplace network effects.” Instead, companies should focus on building communities and market resilience by building NFTs into real-world applications. She said that the key is in valuing utility over speculation. “Platforms should pivot toward utility-driven models that incentivize consistent user engagement, whether through gaming, sports fandom or AI-backed applications,” Sethi said. “Successful platforms will create ecosystems where NFTs are part of an ongoing value cycle, not just speculative trading assets,” she added. Alexander Salnikov, co-founder of the Rarible NFT marketplace, told Cointelegraph that the apparent slump is just part of a larger NFT market cycle. His comments echoed Sethi’s, who also said that utility is key: “NFTs remain one of the most powerful primitives in crypto, and the next wave will be led by projects that focus on strong use cases, whether in gaming, digital identity or brand engagement.” Related: Nvidia's stock price forms’ death cross’ — Will AI crypto tokens follow? A new focus The announcement was scant on details concerning the project that the X2Y2 team is focusing on. Still, the firm suggested that the readers should imagine “yields in a permissionless way, powered by AI.” The new platform will reportedly allow users to earn profits throughout bear and bull markets and entire market cycles, in what is presumably a somewhat decentralized variation on AI-powered trading: “This isn’t just another project; it’s our shot at creating real, long-term value in crypto for the broader community we’re proud to serve.“ The announcement follows early February reports that tokens tied to artificial intelligence agents were down by as much as 90% from 2024 highs . Still, recent reports suggest that the rise of AI-driven crypto agents may be following a familiar trajectory that mirrors the initial boom, bust and resurgence of ICO-era projects.

42698558,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=702963,1743427239,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42698558.jpeg,"US tax revenues fall short as refunds rise, raising early debt ceiling default risks",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-tax-revenues-fall-short-as-refunds-rise/,"The United States is experiencing a major tax revenue shortfall as larger-than-expected refunds shrink government income. The decline in revenue could make it run out of money quicker than expected. If the trend persists, Congress may have to raise the debt ceiling soon to avoid a default. A default means the government cannot meet all its financial obligations on time, which could damage the economy and rattle investors. Some experts had forecasted the US would run out of funds around late summer or early fall. However, if tax collections stay weak, the government could face financial trouble as early as May or June. As of Thursday, the US Treasury had $281 billion in cash and $207 billion in special measures to pay its bills, but that money is running dry. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has told Congress that if tax collections remain weak this spring, the government could hit its financial ceiling by May rather than later this spring. IRS cuts and political gridlock may compound the problem The IRS is bringing in less money than expected. At this point in the year, just 1.1% fewer tax returns have been submitted than at the same time last year. However, since many taxpayers wait until the April 15 deadline to pay taxes, revenue may still rise. But refunds are a different matter. The IRS has issued 4.6% more refunds than last year, implying that the government is losing more money than it gains. Some experts say budget cuts to the IRS could be part of the problem . Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has slashed the IRS headcount, leading to fewer tax audits. With diminished oversight, more taxpayers may be inflating deductions or even avoiding taxes altogether. However, according to a summer report from the Yale Budget Lab, IRS job cuts have two unintended effects. While fewer audits might encourage risky tax filings, they could also result in underreported revenue slipping through the cracks. As the financial deadline on the debt ceiling approaches, lawmakers have yet to outline a clear plan. Senate Majority Leader John Thune is attempting a budget plan with Republicans in control. The plan extends President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and raises the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. But political battles could slow down any decision. If the government is in crisis in May, the Republicans may be forced to set tax cuts aside and only raise the debt ceiling. This would compel them to partner with Democrats, but it will not be easy to strike an agreement. Analysts clash over the timeline amid growing uncertainty Phillip Swagel, director of the CBO, says that although April and June tax payments offer immediate relief to the government, they do not solve its long-term issues at all. Many people wait until the deadline to file, he explains, while some businesses pay in June. But other analysts aren’t buying it. And if IRS budget cuts translate into more people not paying taxes, the government might not receive enough dollars. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will provide a fresh update on the state of the debt ceiling in early May. That update will be key in deciding how quickly the government could run out of money. One big question is whether fewer IRS audits translate to lower tax payments. Richard Prisinzano, a tax expert at the Yale Budget Lab, said people may be bolder about claiming large deductions or even skipping taxes altogether if they know that the IRS has been weakened. He said that if tax payments did not increase markedly, it would mean that people were exploiting their situation. Shai Akabas, an economic policy expert, said the situation is still unclear. He also thought there is a chance the government could exhaust its cash sooner than anticipated. But he argued it is also unlikely that all the worst-case worries would happen simultaneously. He noted that while it is possible, it is not the most likely outcome. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

HashSphere, built with Hedera's technology, aims to bridge private and public distributed ledgers, ensuring compliance with regulations while maintaining interoperability, the company said Monday . Hashgraph is looking to provide services to asset managers, banks and payment providers seeking secure, low-cost cross-border transactions with stablecoins. While public blockchains offer security and transparency, enterprises in industries like finance and payments often face compliance challenges, particularly with know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) requirements. HashSphere addresses this by restricting access to verified participants, enabling firms to develop tokenized assets, AI-powered services and other blockchain-based products while meeting regulatory standards. ""From the start, the vision for Hedera has been to create 'shared worlds' —interconnected networks where enterprises can leverage the power of DLT [distributed ledger technology] without compromising privacy or control,"" said Andrew Stakiwicz, head of solutions at Hashgraph, in the release. The network also integrates Hedera’s existing tools, including the Token Service for managing digital assets and the Consensus Service for recording transactions with trusted timestamps. The platform is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), allowing developers to deploy decentralized applications using Solidity and other EVM languages. Hashgraph said it is currently working with early partners including Australian Payments Plus, Australia's national payments scheme operator, while adding other users. ""We are interested in HashSphere primarily for its enhanced privacy and regulatory compliance, while also needing network interoperability for the seamless and transparent interchange of stablecoins between public Hedera and private HashSphere and other layer-1 protocols,"" said Rob Allen, head of future payments (Web3) strategy at Australian Payments Plus.

Insider Source Speaks,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/the-deadline-is-near-will-donald-trump-impose-tariffs-that-also-suppress-bitcoin-insider-source-speaks/,"As U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to impose sweeping trade measures to reshape the American economy, the Trump administration is racing to finalize details of his new tariff agenda by a self-imposed Wednesday deadline, according to the Wall Street Journal. One key point of contention within the administration is whether to impose individualized tariff rates on U.S. trading partners, as Trump has hinted in recent weeks, or to return to his promise of a blanket tariff affecting nearly all countries doing business with the U.S., according to people familiar with the discussions. Trump has previously tried to temper expectations for his so-called reciprocal tariff plan, but has recently signaled he will take a more aggressive stance. Speaking on Air Force One on Sunday night, the president said he would be “much more generous” than his previous promises to match U.S. tariffs with those of other countries. But sources say he has since urged his team to come up with plans that would impose higher tariffs on a wider range of countries. Trump reinforced that position on Sunday, saying the tariffs would target “essentially all” U.S. trading partners. Related News: Giant Whale is Trapped: Goes Long with 10x Leverage in this Altcoins And Suffers Huge Losses The administration is currently considering the possibility of imposing global tariffs of up to 20% on nearly all of the U.S.’s trading partners, an approach that echoes the plan Trump campaign championed for months before the president moved to a reciprocal tariff model in which the U.S. would match the tariff rates imposed by other countries. Despite the change, an administration official said the reciprocal tariff plan remains under consideration. Trump reportedly leans toward imposing tariffs on every country with which the U.S. has a trade deficit and prefers a “clean bill” for each country, but no final decision has been made. Whatever the final plan, the president wants the policy to be “big and simple,” the official added. That would suggest a broader approach beyond previous plans that focused on the U.S.’ largest trading partners, about 15% of the world’s countries. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has previously referred to those countries as the “dirty 15” in media interviews. In addition to the broad tariffs, the administration is also considering a series of sector-specific duties, potentially targeting critical minerals and related products, among other sectors. It remains unclear whether those tariffs will be announced on April 2, but they are expected to be included in a trade policy review document scheduled to be presented to Trump on Tuesday. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin price plunged for four days, moving to a low of $82,000, while Ethereum tumbled to $1,800 and Ripple slipped to $1.05. This article looks at the top BTC, ETH, and XRP price predictions ahead of Donald Trump’s Liberation Day. Trump’s Liberation Day Could Boost Crypto Prices On theory, the upcoming Liberation Day will be bearish for stocks and the crypto market, which explains why they have tumbled. The Dow Jones futures crashed by 280 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices fell by more than 1%. However, in practice, there is a likelihood that these assets will bounce back, as always happens when there is a major black swan event. For example, American equities embarked on a decade-long bull run after the Global Financial Crisis in 2008/9. Stocks and crypto also surged after the initial plunge following the COVID-19 pandemic. These assets rebound because the Federal Reserve always focuses on the market and acts accordingly. The two rebounds happened after the Fed slashed interest rates to zero and launched the controversial quantitative easing policy. The same may happen this year if evidence shows that the US is approaching a recession. Besides, recent data shows consumer confidence has tumbled while business investment is slowing. Further, from a fundamental perspective, BTC, ETH, and XRP prices have crashed ahead of the Liberation Day. As such, these assets may rebound when it happens since market participants have priced in the tariffs. XRP Price Prediction The daily chart reveals that the XRP price remains under pressure this week, and is approaching the key point at $1.9035. This is a crucial level since it is at the 50% Fibonacci Retracement point. It is also the neckline of the H&S pattern. Worse, the coin is about to form a death cross pattern as the spread between the 50-day and 200-day Weighted Moving Averages (WMA) has narrowed. More downside will be confirmed if the Ripple price plunges below the support at $1.9035. A move below that level risks the XRP price crashing to $1 . A move above the 50-day moving average at $2.34 will invalidate the Ripple forecast. XRP Price Chart BTC Price Technical Analysis The BTC price has crashed in the past few months. Bitcoin has crashed in the past few days, moving below the lower side of the rising wedge pattern. It has also formed a death cross pattern, and is nearing the 50% retracement point. The BTC price has moved below the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo cloud and the major S/R pivot point of the Murrey Math Lines. Therefore, Bitcoin price will likely crash to the ultimate support at $75,000. BTC Price Chart ETH Price Technical Analysis The ETH price has remained under pressure in the past few months. It has dropped and retested the key point at $2,113, a notable level since it was the neckline of the triple-top pattern. A break-and-retest pattern is a popular bearish continuation sign. Therefore, the most likely ETH price prediction is where it drops to the ultimate support at $1,250, down by 30% below the current level. This view will become invalid if the coin rises above $2,113. ETH Price Chart Crypto Market to Rebound After this Sell-Off This BTC, ETH, and XRP price prediction shows that these coins have more downside in the near term. These coins will then bounce back after the fear zone ends, and as the Trump administration starts negotiating with other countries.

Here’s Why Meme Index Presale Can 100X as a Result.",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-is-bullish-long-term-but-short-term-screams-caution-can-meme-index-presale-100x/,"Dogecoin ($DOGE) isn’t just any ol’ dog-themed meme coin. It’s the OG, the first meme coin ever, and today the one with the highest market capitalization ($24.2B). Naturally, meme coin lovers keep an eye on $DOGE for clues to the larger meme coin market’s direction. In this article, we’ll unpack $DOGE’s current outlook, explain the reasons to be both cheerful and cautious about its future, and discuss how a concept like the Meme Index presale could offer the best strategy in the current market scenario. Reasons to Be Bullish on $DOGE On the monthly and weekly charts, Dogecoin is taking support at the crucial 0.618 Fibonacci level . This is a huge buy signal, as it suggests the token has had the perfect amount of correction and is now ready to continue its long-term bullish trend. Also, on the weekly timeframe, the 20 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) is still above the 50 EMA. This confirms a long-term bullish direction. Another reason to feel good about $DOGE is that it’s currently trading at the bottom of a symmetrical triangle pattern (on the 2-hour timeframe). The token is also at a crucial support/resistance zone – indicated by the blue box in the image below. As you can see, this zone has seen numerous reversals in the past. If $DOGE does follow a long-term bullish trend, we could see it regain its recent high of $0.48. $DOGE’s Short-Term Trend Signals Caution Though Dogecoin’s larger picture is bullish, its short-term trend has been bearish for some time already. Indeed, the $DOGE price has been falling since the first week of December. Also, all key trend indicators, such as the 200, 50, and 20 EMAs, are sloping downwards on important short-term timeframes like the daily, 12-hourly, and 4-hourly. It’s always worth noting what’s happening in the larger meme coin market, which isn’t really rallying, either. Apart from $DOGE, prominent tokens such as $SHIB, $PEPE, $TRUMP, and $BONK have all been red in the last seven days. But when the meme coin market is down, presales prevail. As they’ve yet to be listed publically, crypto presales can provide a haven from the current volatility. Indeed, if you’re looking to invest in $DOGE, and a basket of other top meme coins, you can’t go wrong with an instrument like Meme Index ($MEMEX) . What Is Meme Index ($MEMEX)? $MEMEX is a revolutionary crypto project that will help you lose less when the market isn’t favorable and generate a hefty ROI when the market finally turns bullish. That’s because it’s the first-ever provider of meme coin indexes. We’ve all come across the golden stock market investment strategy of putting our money in indexes like the S&P 500. Well, $MEMEX brings the same concept (that of risk-averse investing) to the meme coin space. Meme Index has four indexes, each carrying a different amount of volatility and risk. $MEMEX’s beauty, therefore, lies in the fact that you can choose any one of the four indexes depending on your risk appetite and desired gains. Meme Titan Index : This is a collection of the top eight meme coins, each with a market cap of over $1B. You’ll find established cryptos like $DOGE, $SHIB, and $PEPE, which makes this Index ideal if you’d prefer to bet on tried-and-tested coins. Meme Moonshot Index : Also known as the Rising Stars Index, this contains eight emerging meme coins that are about to hit 1B in market cap and, therefore, enter the Meme Titan Index. It offers a balanced risk-to-reward possibility. Meme Midcap Index : The name probably gives it away. This Index contains meme coins with a market cap between $50M and $250M. It’s ideal for more aggressive investors, who are willing to take on the extra risk in order to chase the possibility of significant gains. Meme Frenzy Index : An assortment of highly volatile tokens that could either rocket to the moon or fall flat, Meme Frenzy is tailor-made for degens, i.e., meme coin investors who like to live life on the wild side. Why Is Meme Index the Next Crypto to Explode? By allowing investors to diversify their total investment across multiple high-potential meme coins, $MEMEX reduces their total risk exposure. To really understand $MEMEX’s future potential, you must remember meme coins are a rapidly growing investment niche. Thanks to the success stories of $DOGE and $PEPE – and more recently, $TRUMP and $BROCCOLI, investors from all around the world are finally realizing the potential of the best meme coins . Meme Index offers perhaps the best investment avenue for new meme coin investors, which is why $MEMEX is at the top of our list of the next cryptos to explode . If you like numbers, check out our $MEMEX price prediction , which suggests this one-of-a-kind altcoin can reach $0.0198 by the end of 2026 – and $0.084 by the end of 2030. Meme Index takes the legwork out of finding meme coins that can 10x or 100x, especially in a market that has thousands of tokens. Additionally, $MEMEX’s indexes are community-driven. Holders will have a vote on which tokens each index includes. The four indexes will also be dynamic, meaning they’ll be regularly updated so that they only contain the cream of the crop at all times. Such real-time portfolio management is an innovation in the meme coin market and could just be the edge you need. How to Benefit from $MEMEX? If you like the idea of buying into an index, then $MEMEX’s approach to meme coin investing could be for you. The good news is Meme Index presale is still live . You can get one $MEMEX for just $0.0166883, but you’ll need to move it, as the $MEMEX presale ends any minute now. Simply put, this is your last chance to buy $MEMEX for such a low price. Once it goes live, there’s a high likelihood it’ll pump to record highs – and you won’t get it for such a discounted price ever again. For more technical information about the project, check out Meme Index’s whitepaper . Also, follow their X feed and Telegram channel for regular updates. Even though all signs point towards the fact that $MEMEX could join the best low-cap coins after listing, it’s important to remember that nothing is guaranteed, especially when it comes to meme coins. Therefore, we recommend only investing an amount that allows you to sleep soundly at night. Last but not least, it’s crucial that you do your own research before investing.

Despite technological advances, this ideal remains elusive in today's fragmented digital economy. Our current commerce landscape is siloed across competing platforms, each creating its own walled garden. Amazon, eBay, and specialized marketplaces for luxury goods may have digitized commerce, but they've simply replaced physical barriers with digital ones. These platforms deliberately maintain high costs and barriers designed to prevent users from migrating to competitors. Algorithms deployed by these platforms are trained explicitly to maximize revenue by adjusting prices dynamically based on comprehensive market data, often keeping prices artificially elevated depending on the broader internet pricing environment. Such practices result in significant price disparities for identical assets across platforms. Inefficiencies persist because the costs of exploiting them—such as substantial platform fees, lengthy onboarding requirements, limited interoperability, and time delays in transactions—typically outweigh potential arbitrage profits. When the cost to exploit a price difference exceeds the potential earnings from the trade, these inefficiencies remain entrenched, allowing platforms to maintain control over users.. Platforms: Efficient Coordinators, Extractive Middlemen Today's platforms serve two essential functions: they aggregate supply and demand, and they establish trusted exchange mechanisms. But they operate with fundamentally misaligned incentives. Platforms don't work for users; they work for shareholders, with a fiduciary duty to maximize extraction. This results in market failures where platforms invariably exploit their position as intermediaries through high fees, manipulated search results, and proprietary ecosystems designed to lock in participants. The platform model is inherently extractive by design. The AI-Crypto Revolution in Commerce The convergence of two powerful technologies is about to disrupt this status quo: AI agents and crypto protocols. AI agents can perform many platform functions — especially supply and demand aggregation — at a fraction of the cost. Unlike platforms, these agents work directly for users, fundamentally realigning incentives. Meanwhile, crypto protocols solve the fair — exchange problem through low-cost, trust-minimized transactions where users only need to trust audited, immutable code rather than corporate intermediaries. The combination creates what I call ""decentralized commerce agents"" — AI that can efficiently discover price differences across marketplaces while using crypto protocols to facilitate secure, low-cost exchange. This dramatically reduces the total cost of arbitrage, suddenly making previously non-viable price differences economically feasible to exploit. The Path to Perfect Markets Here's where it gets interesting: by enabling these agents to retain profits from successful arbitrage operations, they can strategically redistribute gains to incentivize adoption of decentralized commerce protocols. Each successful arbitrage can offer discounts to buyers, bonuses to sellers, and fund continued development of the agent ecosystem. This creates a powerful feedback loop: more users generate more transactions, which create more arbitrage opportunities, yielding more profits, which attract more users. Each cycle consolidates liquidity on decentralized protocols while reducing the viability of isolated, extractive platforms. The result is a steady progression toward that theoretical ideal of a perfect market — a single, liquid marketplace for all assets with minimal transaction costs, maximum price transparency, and efficient pricing. Why This Matters For consumers, this means lower prices, better selection, and truly competitive markets free from platform manipulation. For businesses, it means direct access to customers without paying exorbitant platform taxes. For society, it means markets that more efficiently allocate resources based on actual supply and demand rather than platform algorithmic manipulation. The technical pieces are falling into place. AI capabilities are advancing rapidly, while crypto protocols for decentralized commerce continue to mature. What's missing is the recognition of how powerful these technologies become when combined specifically to disrupt platform economics. Decentralized commerce agents represent not merely an incremental improvement but a fundamental realignment of economic coordination. For the first time, we have the tools to make perfect markets more than just a theoretical construct in economics textbooks. The question is whether we'll seize this opportunity to build a more efficient, accessible, and equitable commercial landscape for everyone.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-31 13:39:58

Goldman Sachs just turned bearish on the US economy. They’re now expecting more Fed and ECB rate cuts and have raised US recession odds to 35%. US President Donald Trump’s latest tariff escalation is set to hit every country, not just a select few. That’s got Wall Street rattled, leaving BTC price to drop by almost 23% in the past 60 days. However, the global crypto market cap has also seen a decline of over 5% over the last month to $2.63 trillion. Goldman warns of higher inflation, slower growth As per reports, Goldman now sees a slower GDP growth forecast of 1.5% instead of 2.0% and higher inflation of 3.5% instead of 3.0%. It seems to be a piece of bad news for the economy but rate cuts could be coming faster. The financial giant expects the US tariff rate to jump 15pp in 2025 and it is 5pp ahead of its baseline forecast. This is about to be the “reciprocal tariff” week as Trump has called Wednesday “Liberation Day” with 20% tariffs coming on more than 25 countries. It can be foreseen that US tariffs will impact $1.5 trillion worth of imports by the end of April. BREAKING: President Trump's team is weighing ""broader and higher tariffs"" ahead of Wednesday's reciprocal tariffs deadline, per WSJ. President Trump is reportedly weighing ""an across-the-board hike of up to 20%.""

On the other side, China has placed 10-15% tariffs on US agricultural products. However, the EU has vowed retaliatory tariffs as well while Mexico’s President has already vowed to announce counter-tariffs on April 3. Bitcoin bleeds as gold shine Meanwhile, Bitcoin is getting wrecked. BTC prices are struggling to regain the crucial $85K mark. It has dropped by around 7% in the last 7 days and down by more than 12% quarterly. Bitcoin is trading at an average price of $82,153 as of press time. Its 24-hour trading volume spiked by 45% on Monday to stand at $20.2 billion. While BTC fumbled, gold hit multiple all-time highs as investors sought a safe-haven bet. BTC is down 30% from its January peak, while gold is stealing the spotlight. Gold ETFs have seen a massive $12 billion in net inflows over the last 2 months. While the S&P 500 is down -5% YTD, gold prices are up nearly 17%. Comparison of Bitcoin’s performance per quarter since 2016. Source: Coinglass As per Coinglass data , Bitcoin’s open interest is down marginally but declining towards the $53 billion mark.

To read full editions, subscribe . We’re heading into the second quarter of the year, and — as I wrote last week — this last quarter was a doozy. But some folks are feeling kind of good about this next quarter…so far. Q2 starts tomorrow and it looks like the crypto retirement dreams are on hold You better close twitter and lock in — Alex (@AlexOnchain) March 31, 2025 Unfortunately, with fresh tariffs on the US horizon, this morning is not off to a great start for crypto or equities. Federico Brokate, head of US business at 21Shares, took away a silver lining to last quarter, which is that 21Shares saw “fantastic flows” for the ETFs. For Brokate, that gives an idea of how much client demand exists. The continued volatility, especially out of Trump’s White House, may continue to spook some of the more risk-on investors. But Brokate remains pretty positive. “I think we’re seeing all the right tailwinds. And so, yes, the volatility at a macro level is impacting performance here in this asset class — like every other asset class — but investors are taking this opportunity to come into the market even at a lower cost basis, which I think is the absolute right move,” he said. None of this, unfortunately, is going to be enough to move us out of the wait-and-see moment we seem stuck in. The big tailwinds are still up in the air: actual regulation, word from the SEC on the slew of crypto ETF filings, and further clarity from the SEC (hopefully from the roundtables they’re hosting). I know it’s not a surprise to any of you, but it’s where we remain. However , this quarter could get us out of this rut, if folks like Empire co-host and Blockworks co-founder Jason Yanowitz are right and we have stablecoin legislation in the next few months . Funnily enough, though, Brokate thinks we’re actually going to become more narrative-driven as institutions continue to pile in. That’s not to say fundamentals won’t play a huge part, but he thinks that investing itself is narrative-driven, and the more crypto aligns with macro, the more important headlines and news events will be. “I think the constant capital [that’s] trickling into the industry is certainly changing the way that prices react to different news. But at the end of the day, all investing, especially when it’s so regulatory and geopolitical — [given that] crypto is a global asset — so all these things are very narrative-driven,” he said.

Additionally, Bitcoin mining giant MARA Holdings revealed plans to raise $2 billion through stock sales to buy more Bitcoin, which is very similar to Michael Saylor’s aggressive accumulation strategy. Meanwhile, California introduced amendments to its Digital Assets bill, aiming to protect Bitcoin self-custody rights and regulate digital asset use. This is part of a broader wave of crypto-related legislation across US states. Hut 8 and Trump Family Aim to Dominate Bitcoin Mining Several members of US President Donald Trump’s family are backing a major new Bitcoin mining initiative that is aimed at becoming the largest in the world. Digital asset mining firm Hut 8 announced that it is acquiring a majority stake in American Bitcoin, which was formerly known as American Data Center. The company was founded by a group of investors that includes Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. Hut8 announcement As part of the acquisition, American Bitcoin will take over ownership of Hut 8’s Bitcoin mining hardware. According to Donald Trump Jr., the investors behind the venture are personally and professionally committed to Bitcoin’s future. The main goal of the new business is to establish itself as the world’s most efficient, pure-play Bitcoin mining platform, while also building a large strategic Bitcoin reserve. Although the mining operations will continue under Hut 8’s compute segment, they will now be operated under the American Bitcoin brand. According to Trump Jr, mining Bitcoin at favorable economics creates a greater opportunity for both the company and investors. He stated that the platform is designed to execute on this strategy and offer investors a direct way to participate in Bitcoin’s growth. Key terms of the agreement The Trump family’s involvement in the crypto space aligns with US President Donald Trump’s recent pro-crypto stance. In the past week, the president pardoned three co-founders of the crypto exchange BitMEX, who previously pleaded guilty to federal money laundering charges. Additionally, the US Treasury removed the decentralized crypto mixer Tornado Cash from its sanctions list, and also nullified associated legal actions . The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also declared that meme coins are not considered securities. Hut 8’s CEO, Asher Genoot, described the launch of American Bitcoin as a key evolution in the company's business strategy. He explained that separating the mining operations will allow the unit to raise its own capital and better align its financial structure. The move is intended to create a more predictable and cost-efficient business model, with American Bitcoin positioned for aggressive growth in Bitcoin production and operational leverage. This strategic shift happened after Hut 8 surpassed $1 billion in Bitcoin holdings after acquiring an additional 990 BTC for $100 million at the end of 2024. At that time, the firm’s total Bitcoin holdings stood at 10,096 BTC, and was purchased at an average price of $24,484 per Bitcoin. MARA to Raise $2B for Bitcoin Purchases Other Bitcoin miners are also making major moves. Miner MARA Holdings Inc recently announced plans to sell up to $2 billion worth of its stock to buy more Bitcoin. This is very similar to the aggressive accumulation strategy that was made popular by Michael Saylor and his company Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy. According to a March 28 filing with the US SEC, MARA entered into an at-the-market agreement with major investment firms, including Cantor Fitzgerald and Barclays, allowing them to sell shares periodically to raise funds. MARA K-8 filing (Source: SEC ) The company stated that the proceeds from this stock offering will be used for general corporate purposes, which includes the acquisition of additional Bitcoin. This mirrors Saylor’s well-known strategy, where Strategy raised billions through stock sales and debt offerings to become the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin. It currently holds close to 506,137 BTC valued at around $42.4 billion. MARA Holdings currently holds the second-largest Bitcoin reserves among publicly traded companies, with approximately 46,374 BTC worth nearly $3.9 billion. The company’s CEO, Fred Thiel, previously committed to a ”full HODL” strategy, which means that MARA does not plan to sell its mined Bitcoin and will continue to accumulate more of the cryptocurrency as part of its long-term vision. Top 10 companies holding Bitcoin (Souce: BitBo ) This latest stock sale plan follows a similar move last year when MARA offered up to $1.5 billion worth of shares and issued $1 billion in convertible senior notes, also primarily to fund Bitcoin purchases. Despite the ambitious announcement, MARA’s stock price reacted negatively. Shares closed down 8.58% at $12.47 on March 28 after broader weakness in crypto mining stocks triggered by reports of Microsoft pulling back on data center investments. The stock slid even more in overnight trading. California Advances Bitcoin Self-Custody Law Meanwhile, a California lawmaker introduced new amendments to a money transmission bill to strengthen protections for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency investors, with a particular focus on safeguarding self-custody rights. Assembly Bill 1052 was initially filed on Feb. 20, 2025 as the Money Transmission Act, but was amended on March 28 by Democrat and Banking and Finance Committee chair Avelino Valencia to include several digital asset-related provisions. The revised legislation has also been renamed “Digital Assets.” The updated bill aims to guarantee Californians the right to self-custody their digital assets without fear of discrimination. Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter stated that if Bitcoin rights can pass in California, they could become a model for the entire country. The bill will also recognize the use of digital financial assets as valid forms of payment in private transactions and will prohibit public entities from restricting or taxing their use based solely on their payment function. Additionally, the bill introduces ethical restrictions on public officials regarding digital assets. Under the amended Political Reform Act of 1974, officials would be barred from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting digital assets, securities, or commodities, and from engaging in any activity that could create a conflict of interest related to digital assets. AB 1052 now entered the desk process and awaits its first formal reading. The move is part of California’s growing interest in digital asset regulation, with data from BTC Maps showing that 99 merchants in the state currently accept Bitcoin payments . Major crypto companies like Ripple Labs, Solana Labs, and Kraken are also based in California. In addition to AB 1052, California introduced a separate stablecoin-focused bill on Feb. 2, 2025, which aims to clarify collateral requirements, liquidation processes, redemption procedures, and audit standards for stablecoins. States considering Bitcoin laws (Source: Bitcoin Laws ) Almost 100 Bitcoin-related bills have been introduced at the state level in 35 states. Among these is Texas’ Bitcoin strategic reserve bill, which passed the Senate earlier this month, and Kentucky’s recently signed Bitcoin Rights bill.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-31 13:43:36

Wainwright & Co. analyst Mike Colonnese. The deal was announced during Galaxy Digital’s Q4 2024 earnings call. As part of the deal, Galaxy will repurpose 200 MW of its Helios mining facility in West Texas to host 133 MW of critical IT load for CoreWeave’s GPUs. The contract is expected to generate $4.5 billion in revenue over its term, or around $300 million annually, which represents 70% of Galaxy’s total 2024 revenues, according to the analyst. These terms are “very favorable relative to other high-performance computing deals,” with an estimated $2.26 million per MW in annual revenue at roughly 90% EBITDA margins. Significant growth potential at Helios While the upfront retrofit costs are expected to range between $1.46 billion and $1.73 billion, Colonnese noted that most of this will be financed through project debt. CoreWeave will cover ongoing electricity and operating expenses, keeping Galaxy’s recurring costs low. The analyst also pointed out that Galaxy has 600 MW of additional capacity at Helios to support future expansion. He wrote: “Applying current data center valuations to contracted capacity for Galaxy’s new data center business, we estimate the segment could eventually be worth over $3.5B, a valuation that is far from being priced into shares.” The analyst is maintaining a Buy rating on Galaxy’s stock with a price target lowered from C$35 to C$30. The price target reflects an approximate 40% discount to traditional finance broker dealers given “Galaxy’s smaller scale and narrow focus on digital assets,” and a 40% discount to Coinbase.

However, the RSI’s lowering ratio and other factors indicate the pullback could be near its end. Rebound Incoming? Ethereum bulls suffered another blow in the past several hours, with ETH’s price dipping below $1,800. This represents a substantial 14% weekly decline and comes as the entire cryptocurrency market bleeds out heavily again. ETH Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite the negative environment, some factors signal a potential resurgence for ETH in the short term. The asset’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen to around 20, registering its lowest point since the beginning of February. The technical analysis tool measures the speed and change of price movements and helps traders asses possible reversals. Readings below 30 typically suggest that ETH has entered oversold territory, indicating a potential bounce ahead. Conversely, anything above 70 is considered a bearish sign. Ethereum’s exchange netflow also signals that the correction could be nearing its end. In the past week, more ETH has been withdrawn from exchanges than deposited, hinting that investors are moving their assets to self-custody. This trend typically lowers the immediate selling pressure. Price Predictions ETH has been one of the biggest disappointments of the latest bull cycle, and in fact, Q1 2025 has been among the worst quarters of the cryptocurrency’s history. Recall that at the start of the year, the price stood above $3,300, while the current level represents a 45% decline from New Year’s Eve. However, some market observers remain optimistic that ETH can get back on the green track soon. The X user Crypto General expects “a bullish momentum” if the price reclaims $2,000. “For long-term people, it’s a golden opportunity to add at such cheap prices. These zones don’t come very often,” they argued. On the other hand, the analyst envisioned a further breakdown to $1,500 if the price remains below “the skeptical zone” of $1,800. Michael van de Poppe also chipped in. He reminded that gold has had a highly successful quarter compared to the devastating one witnessed by ETH. Nonetheless, he believes the ongoing week “might be a big one,” pointing to Donald Trump’s upcoming tariffs, which are scheduled to come into effect on April 2 and may trigger another doze of uncertainty in the financial and crypto markets. The renowned analyst even suggested that the “Sell the rumor, Buy the news” phenomenon might be in play. This is a twist of the common trading phrase “Buy the rumor, sell the news” and means that people may sell early based on negative speculation. When the actual news turns out not as bad as feared, the prices bounce, and savvy traders buy the dip.

For most of 2024 and into early 2025, Solana dominated the retail DeFi narrative. It became the network of choice for memecoins tied to celebrities, influencers and political figures, including US President Donald Trump . However, the ecosystem took a reputational hit after Argentine President Javier Milei jumped on the memecoin bandwagon. His associated project, “Libra,” was accused of insider trading . The controversy dented trust in Solana’s memecoin sector and opened the door for competitors. BNB Chain has seized the moment, capturing displaced memecoin volume. The chain has its own memecoin platform, Four.Meme — comparable to Solana’s Pump.fun — and introduced daily competitions to promote new projects and subsidize their liquidity. Some of these memecoins have even gone on to secure listings on Binance itself. This momentum is clearly reflected in the trading volume of the network’s top decentralized exchange (DEX), PancakeSwap. In a two-week stretch from March 15, PancakeSwap led all EVM chains’ DEX volume on nine separate days, according to Dune Analytics data. PancakeSwap on BNB Chain dominates the second half of March in DEX volume. Source: Dune Analytics “It’s worth noting that PancakeSwap’s recent volume spike likely stems from renewed retail enthusiasm for BNB memecoins. Unlike other ecosystems where meme-related volume has declined over recent weeks, BNB Chain has seen significant growth in this sector,” said Justin Barlow, head of business development and investments at Sei Foundation. In a written analysis shared with Cointelegraph on March 27, Barlow reviewed CoinGecko data and found that just two BNB memecoins were responsible for roughly 13% of PancakeSwap’s daily trading volume. Related: Insider trading allegations surface as TRUMP memecoin floods Solana DEXs BNB Chain’s reversal of fortune BNB Chain launched in 2020 as Binance Smart Chain, positioning itself as a low-cost, fast and EVM-compatible alternative to Ethereum at a time when high gas fees and limited L1 options made Ethereum less accessible. It quickly attracted developers and users but developed a reputation for scammy projects and faced criticism for centralization . As regulatory pressure on Binance mounted , activity on the chain declined while more decentralized and innovative ecosystems like Ethereum L2s and Solana gained momentum. PancakeSwap has become the centerpiece of BNB Chain’s resurgence, sustaining high-volume trading across the network. According to DefiLlama, BNB Chain led all blockchains in DEX volume for eight days during the two-week period starting March 15 — the same stretch in which PancakeSwap dominated the EVM DEX landscape. Binance-linked BNB Chain dominates second-half of March. Source: DefiLlama “DEX volumes are a clear signal of user engagement and interest in DeFi, and sustained activity on a platform like PancakeSwap suggests that retail interest in BNB Chain and its memecoin ecosystem is growing,” Barlow said. A byproduct of DEX volume growth is higher yields for liquidity providers. In addition to DEX volume, BNB Chain recently led the industry in active addresses among EVM networks — and was second only to Solana across all blockchain ecosystems over the past week. Binance-backed growth, memecoin liquidity and Broccoli The resurgence of BNB Chain is closely linked to the boom in memecoins. In February, BNB Chain published its 2025 tech roadmap , reaffirming its commitment to supporting the memecoin ecosystem. “We are happy to see many of the meme tool providers integrate with BNB Chain. And we will continue to work closely with them in 2025 and beyond,” the announcement said. Just days later, Binance founder Changpeng Zhao posted on X that his dog’s name is Broccoli, a remark that sparked a wave of Broccoli-themed memecoins on BNB Chain. Zhao added that he would not be issuing a memecoin himself but would “likely interact” with a few tokens on the network. Source: Changpeng Zhao Memecoin activity has been surging ever since. One example came in late March; in a now-viral trade, one trader reportedly invested $232 into the Mubarak memecoin to profit $1.1 million, according to Lookonchain. Savvy trader flips $232 of Mubarak memecoin into $1.1 million. Source: Lookonchain BNB Chain has also outpaced competitors in several core DeFi metrics. It recently surpassed both Solana and Ethereum L2s in daily fees generated . To further support the momentum, BNB Chain launched the ""BNB Chain Meme Liquidity Support Program"" on Feb. 18. The initiative provides $200,000 in permanent liquidity to top-performing memecoins . “Memecoins are absolutely driving the recent activity. You can see it in the sharp increase in the number of newly created tokens and the uptick in smaller trade sizes, which often accompany memecoin speculation. When TVL remains stable but volume spikes, it's usually retail trading that’s driving the difference — and right now, that energy is heavily concentrated in BNB Chain’s meme sector,” Rachel Lin, CEO of DEX SynFutures, told Cointelegraph. Related: XRP and Solana race toward the next crypto ETF approval Solana vs. BNB: Who owns the memecoin crown? Data suggests that Solana’s memecoin sector is cooling off . According to Solscan , token launches dropped to around 26,300 on March 22, the lowest since November. Daily transaction volume also hit a low of under 43 million on March 1, according to Nansen, the lowest figure since November. Solana’s transaction volume is also on a downward trend along with cooling memecoin activity. Source: Nansen Even in a downtrend, Solana’s activity levels remain significantly higher than BNB Chain’s. Nansen data shows that Solana's lowest transaction day still outpaced BNB Chain’s peak of 7.8 million transactions. But momentum appears to be shifting. BNB Chain’s transactions have risen but are still far behind Solana. Source: Nansen Pump.fun, Solana’s memecoin launchpad, is also seeing signs of fatigue. Fewer than 1% of new tokens meet the platform’s requirements to become tradable. The drop in bonding levels points to a cooling period for Solana’s memecoin market. But this doesn’t necessarily signal a shift in long-term dominance, said Alan Orwick, co-founder of Quai Network. “This pattern reflects the cyclical nature of speculative interest across blockchain ecosystems, which ultimately brings renewed energy to DeFi.” “This rotation appears to be influenced by regional preferences, with increased Asian market participation driving activity on Binance-related platforms,” Orwick said. Lin of SynFutures added that the key difference between Solana and BNB Chain’s momentum is the audience: “Solana has become more native to crypto traders, whereas BNB Chain draws a more global, retail-first crowd. We’re not necessarily seeing one chain dominate long-term, but rather a rotation of capital and attention depending on user behavior and transaction economics."" The rise of BNB Chain amid Solana’s slowdown highlights the fast-moving, cyclical nature of crypto markets, especially in the memecoin space. While Solana still leads in raw activity, BNB Chain is proving it can capture retail attention and drive meaningful volume when the moment is right. With strong backing from Binance, dedicated liquidity programs and viral meme momentum, BNB Chain has reclaimed relevance in DeFi.

Furthermore, strong employment data may delay any Federal Reserve intervention, reducing the chances of a market rebound.

Amid this forecast, below are the top 4 altcoins to buy to enjoy significant returns. Goldman Sachs Predicts Three Fed Rate Cuts in 2025 Goldman Sachs has raised the number of times that it expects the Federal Reserve to trim interest rates this year from two to three. The investment bank anticipates these rate cuts to happen during the July, September, and November FOMC meetings. The higher number of rate cuts follows an increased risk of the US economy falling into a recession. Goldman Sachs has increased its recession odds to 35% due to President Trump’s move to impose reciprocal tariffs on all countries. The Fed might now be forced to lower rates to stimulate economic growth. Data from the CME FedWatchTool also shows that most investors anticipate the Fed to cut rates in June. 64% of investors expect a 25 basis point rate cut while 14% of investors anticipate a 50 basis point rate cut. CME FedWatch Tool Rate cuts are good for risk assets like cryptocurrencies hence the need for crypto investors to find the best altcoins to buy today. 4 Altcoins to Buy Today for Significant Gains The best altcoins that crypto investors can buy today for significant gains include Ripple (XRP), BNB Coin (BNB), Toncoin (TON), and Litecoin (LTC). Ripple (XRP) One of the top altcoins to buy amid the downturn in the broader crypto market is Ripple. XRP price has shown much strength by sustaining a price level above $2 despite intense selling activity. This suggests it might lead the market recovery in case of a reversal. XRP price has formed a bullish double-bottom pattern on the hourly price chart. This points towards a bullish breakout to $2.46 in the near term. At the same time, the MACD line has formed a buy signal after crossing above the signal line, which further suggests that Ripple may rally further . XRP/USDT: 1-hour Chart BNB Coin (BNB) BNB is also one of the best altcoins to buy as the BNB Chain records significant growth. Recently, the BNB Chain recorded a significant growth in trading volumes, with the number of BNB users rising by 56% . As this growth continues, it will bode well for the BNB token. In terms of price, BNB is showing resilience. The AO bars have shifted to the positive side, but the RSI indicates that the selling pressure is still strong. If the uptrend continues, the next target for BNB price is the 78.6% Fibonacci level of $682. BNB/USDT: 1-day Chart Toncoin (TON) Toncoin is outperforming the rest of the crypto market today as it trades at $4.01 with a 5.5% increase in 24 hours. These gains are being driven by whale activity with IntoTheBlock data showing that large transaction volumes increasing to $34 billion last week. Toncoin Whale Activity The rising whale activity and recent gains despite the market turbulence support the thesis on why TON is one of the best altcoins to buy. This whale activity further indicates a bullish Toncoin price forecast . Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu price today trades at $0.0000123 with a 2% decline in 24 hours. Despite this dip, SHIB is still one of the top altcoins to buy because of the surging burn rate. Data from Shibburn shows that in the last 24 hours, this burn rate soared by over 700%, indicating that the meme coin’s supply is dropping significantly. The 1-day chart further shows a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction . This meme coin has formed a falling wedge pattern, and it is testing the breakout from the upper trendline. This could result in an over 79% rally. SHIB/USDT: 1-day Chart Summary of Top Altcoins to Buy Investment banking giant Goldman Sachs has predicted that the Federal Reserve will trim interest rates three times in 2025. These rate cuts could bode well for risk assets, and investors looking for the best altcoins to buy in case of a rebound should consider XRP, BNB, TON, and SHIB.

For emerging economies — countries like India, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, Thailand, or Vietnam — strategic exposure to cryptocurrencies is essential for future economic resilience. They collectively represent over 40% of the global population and approximately 25% of global GDP, yet they remain vulnerable to external economic shocks, including currency fluctuations, trade disruptions, and more. Today, their sovereign reserves remain heavily reliant on traditional assets like gold and foreign exchange. But those aren’t sufficient hedges in a rapidly digitizing world. Cryptocurrencies aren’t an experiment anymore. While Bitcoin is the most widely adopted, making it the primary example in this discussion, the broader argument applies to cryptocurrencies as a whole. The Bitcoin network has been operational for over 99.98% of the time since its inception in 2009 . Cryptocurrencies have survived wars, regulatory crackdowns, and multiple financial crises. Over the last decade, bitcoin has appreciated nearly 200X, far outpacing tech giants like NVIDIA or Apple. The crypto space, no denying, has faced scams, rug pulls, and bad actors. This is common in virtually any financial system — think early stock markets or banking. That’s why smart regulation is critical. Countries like Singapore, Japan, and Switzerland have already struck a balance between consumer protection and innovation, offering models for others. But these risks don’t negate crypto’s core appeal — they demand careful governance. Diversification is key. Ask any central banker, fund manager, or financial advisor: you don’t put all your eggs in one basket, and you certainly don’t bet the future of an economy on a single asset class. In a world that’s rapidly digitizing, ignoring digital assets like cryptocurrencies is a mistake. These assets tend to have little correlation with how other traditional assets perform, making bitcoin a strong hedge against economic turbulence. We’re seeing entire publicly listed companies built around bitcoin as a core asset. Take Michael Saylor’s Strategy, which started as a software firm and now holds over 506,137 BTC (approximately $42 billion as of writing). Countries like El Salvador have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender. Vietnam, India, and Thailand rank among the top 10 countries globally for cryptocurrency adoption already. EAEs must follow this shift or fall behind. Bitcoin isn’t the new digital gold — it serves a very different role. In many cultures, more so in mine, we Indians love our gold. We hoard it, gift it, and trust it as a store of value. Central banks across the world have been buying gold at a record pace in recent years. But gold wasn’t always the safe bet we think it is today — back in the 1980s, its price crashed by 60% before bouncing back. Bitcoin brings new utility: it can be transferred anywhere in the world in minutes, divided into microscopic fractions, and secured with cryptographic protocols. Gold and Bitcoin share fundamental traits — they’re scarce, resilient, and hedge against uncertainty — but gold preserves value traditionally, while bitcoin expands possibilities digitally. They don’t replace each other; they work together. Critics often dismiss crypto as mere speculation, but its utility is real. Major companies like Microsoft and Starbucks now accept bitcoin and stablecoins for transactions. U.S. bitcoin ETFs have attracted over $12 billion in institutional inflows within months. Crypto enables faster, cheaper remittances , cutting global fees from 6.4% to under 1%, saving billions for developing economies. With over $100 billion locked in DeFi protocols, it’s clear that the future of finance is already being built on blockchain. Emerging economies should take a strategic, forward-looking step toward economic resilience. A 1-2% allocation in digital assets is smart, not a gamble. Track its performance, take cues from early movers like the U.S., El Salvador, and Strategy, and refine the approach as you go. Encourage financial institutions to experiment with crypto-backed financial instruments in a limited way. Proactive regulatory frameworks are vital to foster innovation while ensuring stability. Countries must position themselves for the future. Holding digital assets reduces reliance on external financial systems and insulates them from geopolitical and monetary shifts. We’ve seen this playbook before — these countries weren’t the first to embrace digital payments, yet they built world-class infrastructure like India’s UPI , Brazil’s PIX , and Nigeria’s NIBSS . The same leadership is possible in crypto reserves. With the global crypto market nearing $3 trillion and institutional adoption accelerating, the question isn’t if this shift will happen—it’s who will lead it. Emerging economies can start building a strategic reserve today or hear in five years at another dinner party in five years, “If only we had bought bitcoin in 2025.” The time is now.",Opinion,EN,0,0,ASIA|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|ZRX,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-31 15:19:28

The stablecoin issuer is allegedly already working with top financial institutions to achieve this move. Circle To File IPO In Late April According to a Fortune report , Circle is looking to file its IPO in late April, although the listing period remains uncertain. The report noted that when a company files to go public, its shares usually begin trading four weeks later, indicating that the listing could occur in May. However, there is also a scenario where the IPO process could drag on for months. The stablecoin issuer is reportedly working with investment banks JPMorgan Chase and Citi to achieve its long-anticipated IPO. The firm had previously tried to go public in 2021 under a SPAC arrangement with a shell company. The US SEC failed to sign off on this arrangement back then, and the company eventually scrapped these IPO plans by the end of 2022 when the crypto exchange FTX collapsed and the broader crypto market experienced a downturn. Revelation about Circle’s IPO plans comes just days after the stablecoin issuer partnered with NYSE’s parent company to explore USDC’s use in traditional finance (TradFi). Meanwhile, the USDC stablecoin recently launched in Japan following approval from the country’s regulator. Notably, USDC is the first and only global dollar stablecoin approved under Japan’s stablecoin framework. An Easier Path Now For The Stablecoin Issuer Circle will likely face less resistance for its IPO plans under the current SEC administration. Under acting Chair Mark Uyeda, the Commission has shown its willingness to work hand in hand with crypto firms, which was missing under Gary Gensler’s administration. US SEC Chair nominee Paul Atkins has also shown his willingness to change the approach that Gensler’s administration adopted towards crypto firms. During his nomination hearing, the SEC Chair nominee promised to prioritize providing regulatory clarity for the industry. Circle’s IPO listing would be the biggest since the top crypto exchange Coinbase went public in 2021. Interestingly, Coinbase owns an equity stake in the crypto firm. The firm’s USDC is currently the second-largest stablecoin by market cap, only behind Tether’s USDT. The stablecoin industry is heating up as more financial institutions look to develop their own stablecoin. Donald Trump’s World Liberty Financial recently revealed plans to launch its USD1 stablecoin, while asset manager Fidelity is also considering doing so.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/elon-musks-upsetting-statement-for-dogecoin-doge-investors-here-are-the-details/,"Dogecoin’s (DOGE) hopes of playing a role in the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) have been dashed after Elon Musk confirmed that he has no plans to integrate the popular memecoin into the initiative. Elon Musk Denies Dogecoin’s Role in DOGE Initiative “There are no plans for the government to use Dogecoin or anything else,” Musk said at an America PAC town hall in Wisconsin. This statement comes after weeks of speculation that DOGE could be incorporated into the controversial nonprofit, a belief fueled by the temporary appearance of a Dogecoin logo on the official DOGE website following Donald Trump’s inauguration. Musk explained the reasoning behind his choice of name: “I was going to call it the Government Efficiency Commission, but that's a boring name. Then the internet said it should be the Government Efficiency Commission. I said, the internet was right.” Following Musk’s comments, DOGE prices fell 3.5%, reflecting broader market trends. While there are no official plans to include Dogecoin in DOGE, speculation has fueled a months-long rally in DOGE prices and inspired several copycat tokens. Aimed at streamlining government spending and increasing efficiency, DOGE has reportedly saved $130 billion since its official launch in January 2025, saving an average of $840 per taxpayer. Despite the lack of a Dogecoin connection, Musk’s continued public support of DOGE has historically influenced the token’s price movements, leaving many wondering what the next chapter will hold for the memecoin’s future in politics and finance. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) dropped from an all-time high of $109,300 in January to $82,000, while Ethereum ( ETH ) has slumped from $4,100 in November to $1,800. Other altcoins have retreated, with blue-chip names like Solana ( SOL ), Cardano ( ADA ), and Polkadot ( DOT ) falling by double digits from their highest levels in 2024. Cryptocurrencies have largely moved in sync with the U.S. stock market, which has entered a correction. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index fell by 350 points on Monday and has dropped to its lowest level since September. Similarly, the Russell 2000, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones have all declined by double digits from their highs earlier this year. On the other hand, gold prices have continued to shine this year. The metal has rallied for five consecutive weeks and is now at an all-time high of $3,120. It is up over 20% this year, while the largest gold ETFs like GLD and IAUM are seeing substantial inflows. Gold vs stocks vs crypto market cap | Source: TradingView Gold is seen as a better safe haven asset than crypto The ongoing surge in gold prices, coupled with the decline in stock and cryptocurrency prices, suggests that investors view gold as a superior safe-haven asset amid rising risks. Investors see the upcoming Donald Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs as a black swan event that could lead to a recession . Trump has already announced sweeping tariffs in recent weeks. Last week, he unveiled a 25% tariff on imported cars to the United States. He has also imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico. His Liberation Day plan includes reciprocal tariffs on most countries that do business with the U.S. He hopes the measures will spur domestic investment and reduce the trade deficit. The challenge, however, is that tariffs are effectively taxes, which could reduce consumer spending and push the U.S. economy into a recession. On the positive side, a recession would likely prompt the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates and initiate quantitative easing, which could drive renewed demand for risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. Further, Trump is also counting on the Mar-a-Lago Accord, which aims to devalue the U.S. dollar to make American goods more competitive abroad.

42703346,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144767,1743434754,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary Amazon Nova Act: AI Agent Set to Conquer Web Browsers,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/amazon-nova-act-ai-agent/,"Hold onto your hats, crypto enthusiasts! Amazon just dropped a bombshell in the AI world that could ripple through every sector, including ours. They’ve unveiled Nova Act , a groundbreaking AI agent that’s not just another chatbot – it’s designed to take the reins of your web browser and perform actions independently. Imagine the possibilities! This isn’t just about smarter assistants; it’s about the next evolution of how we interact with the internet and, potentially, the digital assets space. Unveiling Amazon Nova Act: A Game-Changer in AI Agent Technology Amazon’s newly minted AGI lab in San Francisco is behind this intriguing creation, Nova Act . Think of it as a general-purpose AI agent with a very specific skill set: web browser control . This isn’t about passively understanding web pages; it’s about actively interacting with them. Alongside this agent, Amazon is rolling out the Nova Act SDK, a developer toolkit. This toolkit is crucial, as it empowers developers to experiment and build early prototypes using Nova Act ‘s capabilities. Here’s a quick rundown of what makes Nova Act noteworthy: Agentic AI Model: Nova Act is designed to be an agent, meaning it can perform actions autonomously, not just respond to prompts. Web Browser Control: Its primary function is to navigate and interact with web browsers, opening up a world of automation possibilities. Developer SDK: The Nova Act SDK allows developers to get hands-on, building and testing applications powered by this new technology. Research Preview: Amazon is calling this initial release a “research preview,” suggesting it’s still in development but ready for early exploration. Alexa+ Integration: Crucially, Nova Act is slated to be a core component of Amazon’s upcoming Alexa+ upgrade, a generative AI enhanced version of their popular voice assistant. You can dive into the Nova Act toolkit yourself at nova.amazon.com, a website that also serves as a hub for Amazon’s Nova foundation models. Nova Act vs. Competitors: Amazon’s Bold Move in the AI Agent Race Amazon isn’t entering this arena in a vacuum. They are directly challenging tech giants like OpenAI and Anthropic, who are also developing AI agent technologies like Operator and Computer Use, respectively. The belief across these leading tech companies is that AI agents capable of seamlessly navigating the web will dramatically enhance the utility of today’s AI chatbots. Imagine an AI agent that can not only answer your questions but also book flights, manage your crypto portfolio across different exchanges, or even participate in decentralized governance forums on your behalf – all through web browser control . While Amazon might not be the absolute first to the party with this type of technology, their potential reach through Alexa+ is immense. This widespread accessibility could be a game-changer in how quickly and broadly AI agents are adopted by everyday users. The race is on to see who can create the most reliable and user-friendly AI agent , and Amazon is making a strong statement with Nova Act . Powering Alexa+ and Beyond: The Versatility of Nova Act Amazon highlights that developers using the Nova Act SDK should be able to automate a range of basic actions for users. Think about tasks like ordering your favorite salad from Sweetgreen or securing dinner reservations – mundane tasks that could be seamlessly handled by an AI agent . The Nova Act toolkit is designed to empower developers by providing the necessary building blocks for agentic applications. These tools allow an AI agent to: Navigate Web Pages: Understand and move through the structure of websites. Fill Out Forms: Input data into web forms, a crucial step for many online interactions. Select Dates on Calendars: Interact with calendar interfaces for scheduling and appointments. These might seem like simple actions, but they are fundamental to automating a vast number of online tasks. For the crypto space, this could translate to automating DeFi interactions, tracking market data across multiple platforms, or even managing NFT marketplaces more efficiently. The possibilities are truly expansive. Benchmarking Brilliance: How Nova Act Stacks Up Amazon is making bold claims about Nova Act ‘s performance, stating that it outperforms agents from OpenAI and Anthropic in several internal tests. Specifically, they cite the ScreenSpot Web Text benchmark, which measures an AI agent ‘s ability to interact with text on a screen. Here’s how Nova Act reportedly performed against competitors: AI Agent Benchmark Score (ScreenSpot Web Text) Nova Act (Amazon) 94% CUA (OpenAI) 88% Claude 3.7 Sonnet (Anthropic) 90% According to these internal tests, Nova Act demonstrates superior performance in screen interaction. However, it’s worth noting that Amazon hasn’t yet benchmarked Nova Act using more widely recognized agent evaluations like WebVoyager. Independent evaluations will be crucial to fully assess Nova Act ‘s capabilities compared to its rivals. The Minds Behind Nova Act: From OpenAI to Amazon’s AGI Lab The genesis of Nova Act within Amazon’s AGI lab is particularly interesting. This initiative is co-led by David Luan and Pieter Abbeel, both prominent figures who previously worked at OpenAI. Before joining Amazon, Luan founded Adept, and Abbeel co-founded Covariant, both successful AI ventures. Amazon’s recruitment of these AI heavyweights last year underscores their serious commitment to AI agent development. While building an AI agent to order salads might seem a far cry from Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), David Luan believes that these agents are a critical stepping stone. He defines AGI as “an AI system that can help you do anything a human does on a computer.” From this perspective, mastering web browser control and task automation is indeed a fundamental step towards more advanced AI systems. Luan emphasizes that the Nova Act SDK is designed for reliably automating short, simple tasks, while also providing developers with tools to define when human intervention is needed. The goal is to create more dependable agentic applications, even if they aren’t fully autonomous just yet. This pragmatic approach suggests Amazon is focusing on building practical, useful AI agents that can solve real-world problems. Reliability and the Future: Will Nova Act Overcome AI Agent Challenges? Amazon is entering a crowded and competitive space with its first generalist AI agent . Reliability remains a significant hurdle for current AI agents from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Early iterations have been criticized for being slow, struggling with prolonged independent operation, and making errors that humans wouldn’t. Bitcoin World’s own tests have echoed these concerns. The success of Nova Act could be a pivotal moment for Amazon’s AI ambitions, particularly for the long-awaited Alexa+ upgrade. Early performance of Nova Act will offer a crucial glimpse into the potential capabilities of Alexa+, which many see as a make-or-break moment for Amazon’s AI efforts. The question is: has Amazon cracked the code to create a truly reliable and effective AI agent , or will Nova Act face the same reliability challenges as its competitors? The tech world, and especially the crypto community watching the intersection of AI and digital assets, will be keenly observing.

These altcoins have recently shown signs of testing important support areas. The outcome of this test could signal either a bullish rise or a potential drop. What will these next steps mean for ADA and XRP investors? Discover the insights ahead. Cardano Shows Resilience Despite Short-Term Setbacks Last month Cardano saw minimal change at about -0.16% while the past six months recorded a robust rise of 79.26%. The coin maintained a range between roughly $0.44 and $0.89, reflecting sustained upward interest despite a brief setback. A weekly drop of approximately 11.25% highlights short-term corrections even as long-term sentiment remains positive. Currently, the price trades with key support near $0.2557 and resistance at $1.1457, indicating a defined trading zone. Negative indicators, including a low RSI of 38.39 and subdued momentum, suggest bears are in control in the short term, though a bounce from support may spark buying. Traders might consider carefully timed entries and exits within these levels. XRP: From Six-Month Surge to Short-Term Correction XRP delivered a significant gain over six months, up 240.56%, but has recently faced a decline of 5.24% in the last month and a 16.72% drop over the past week. Price action reveals a strong long-term upward trend, though recent months have shown some pullback. The coin traded between $1.60 and $2.88, highlighting both rapid rallies and notable retracements. Current price levels are confined between $1.60 and $2.88. The nearest support is at $1.06, while resistance appears near $3.61 and a secondary level at $4.89. Bears are dominant in the short term as key indicators show a negative trend. Traders should consider buying near support and selling as prices approach resistance zones. Conclusion Both ADA and XRP are currently at critical support levels. Their next moves will be crucial. Market reaction at these levels will likely dictate short-term price direction. Watching for a bounce or a breach is key. Both coins are at a pivotal moment. Investors and traders should keep an eye on market dynamics for clues.

Ripple’s long-standing battle with the U.S. SEC is nearing its final stages, with a resolution expected within the next 60 days. This legal milestone has reignited hopes for an XRP ETF approval, boosting market confidence. However, the price narrative tells a different story. Since January 2025, XRP has fallen by 35%, marking one of the sharpest declines among major cryptocurrencies. Despite occupying the U.S. strategic reserve alongside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, and Solana, XRP’s performance has been underwhelming. Bettors Are Growing Bearish Market sentiment has shifted dramatically. A bet placed on Polymarket reveals that the chances of XRP hitting a new all-time high before July have plummeted from nearly 90%—following Donald Trump’s inauguration—to a mere 4%. This marks the lowest confidence level ever recorded for XRP’s price growth in the first half of 2025. A Massive $40 Million XRP Withdrawal Adding to the turbulence, Whale Alert, the blockchain tracking service, detected a big transaction involving 40 million XRP, valued at around $83.5 million. The funds were withdrawn from Bithumb, South Korea’s second-largest crypto exchange, and sent to an anonymous wallet. This move raises questions about potential market impacts and the intentions behind such large transfers. Peter Brandt’s Grim Price Prediction Renowned trader and market analyst Peter Brandt has weighed in with a bearish outlook for XRP. Brandt compared XRP’s current speculative value to that of Beanie Babies and Pet Rocks, suggesting it holds little intrinsic worth. He tweeted: “Your favorite Beanie Baby/Pet Rock crypto displays a classic complex H&S top. This could become bullish if $3.0 is exceeded; otherwise, expect a decline to $1.07. If you have an issue with this, take it up with Magee and Edwards. $XRP” Brandt’s technical analysis points to a price drop unless XRP can reclaim the $3 mark, which many traders view as a critical threshold.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-31 15:26:47

The sale of 524 million+ tokens for $0.0734 each has become the most successful crypto token offering of 2025 according to market observers. The project builds a simple crypto-to-cash conversion system which attracts users of all experience levels. The main problem of digital currency conversion to spendable money receives a solution through Remittix according to observers. Long-term utility has emerged as a discussion point because the project concentrates on sustainable value rather than short-term marketing buzz. A Novel Approach to Crypto and Fiat Remittix presents a straightforward remedy to resolve the universal problem of using crypto tokens in actual markets. Remittix allows users to bypass complicated bridging methods while offering instantaneous off-ramps through its platform. New digital token adopters gain comfort in spending or withdrawing funds due to this system. The combination of everyday usability leads analysts to predict that Remittix will maintain market visibility even if general market fluctuations occur. The creation of extensive user bases stems from simple designs which allow tech-uninclined individuals to adopt a product. Participants who joined the Remittix presale ahead of time view its practical orientation as protection against market volatility. Tokens with immediate benefits succeed in the market because their worth moves independently from speculation mechanics. Remittix will establish itself permanently by solving basic financial requirements of users. Fans believe that merging cryptocurrencies with traditional money in this way provides an opportunity to acquire new investors from conventional financial circles provided the solution remains straightforward to the average person. Why This Presale Gained Speed In a short period Remittix has surpassed the $14 million presale goal which shows strong ongoing momentum against other competitors in the market. Two principal variables account for Remittix’s success according to observers: its concise story about reducing obstacles and its structured presale methodology. The team made tokens accessible to different trading market levels by setting the price at $0.0734 per token. A wide range of potential supporters entered the picture because of this appeal. Another key factor benefits Remittix because it provides a practical solution in place of yet another theoretical platform. The market value of specific digital coins tends to rise significantly after they introduce practical application usage. Remittix stands to attract quick adoption through its instant operations because major exchanges backing its use can drive adoption. Remittix tokens attract participants seeking straightforward processes since they can buy tokens through mainstream assets. Future Prospects The presale success of $14.2 million+ combined with the speculation about exchange listings demonstrates Remittix continues upward trajectory. Forecasters expect significant financial growth because fast solutions create opportunities to attract millions of users. Future product development would follow once Remittix achieves widespread use in payment and withdrawal transactions. User adoption rates and system reliability determine the performance of any new token since its successful launch relies on these two key factors. Remittix will back up its market enthusiasm when it successfully launches instant bridging functions that connect to established brands. The project shows strong fundamental support through its strong presale performance. The practical nature of Remittix in the speculative crypto coin market creates potential for both stability and positive market movement. Conclusion The strong presale performance of Remittix featuring $14.2 million+ capital raise and 524 million token sales demonstrates that users want a useful altcoin system for direct cryptocurrency-to-fiat exchanges. Many early investors consider Remittix as a reliable investment for 2025 because its basic functionality enhances typical money exchanges. The initial positive reception toward Remittix points toward a widespread appreciation of its utility-based mission despite uncertainties existing in all future outlooks. The new token promises to become one of the leading cryptocurrencies during the next year if everything continues on its current path.

As global markets brace for potential economic turbulence, crypto investors are left wondering whether this week, marked by key geopolitical events, could finally bring a reversal. Ethereum’s Struggles Contrast with Gold’s Rally Q1 2025 is officially ETH’s worst start to the year, as market analyst Michaël van de Poppe noted after its price plunged 45% across the three-month period. It started the year trading at around $3,200 but steadily shed much of that value, dropping below the $2,500 support in mid-February before touching $2,200. This past month alone, ETH has lost another 18.5%. The cryptocurrency is trading at $1,813, almost 63% below its all-time high of $4,878, set in November 2021. Additionally, it has lost more than half of its year-on-year value. The short-term price action is equally grim. Over the past week, the asset has fallen 14%, underperforming the broader crypto market, which declined by a less glaring 7.4%. The 24-hour trading range has also been quite volatile, with ETH swinging between a low of $1,782 and a high of $1,838 amid thin liquidity and weak demand. Meanwhile, as the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap flounders, gold is experiencing one of its strongest rallies in almost four decades. This week, the precious metal jumped to a record high of $3,128 per ounce, marking a 20% gain for the quarter, its best performance since 1986. According to analysts, the rally has been fueled by growing fears of inflation and economic instability as U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to announce sweeping tariffs on April 2, dubbed “Liberation Day.” “Gold is rallying due to the uncertainties surrounding the tariffs from Trump,” said van de Poppe. He further speculated that ETH’s bottom may coincide with gold’s peak, setting the stage for a possible rebound in crypto markets: “I don’t know where this will bottom, although I suspect that the peak of Gold and the bottom of Ethereum are going to be correlated.” ETH/BTC Ratio Hits Four-Year Low The asset’s struggles are even more pronounced when measured against Bitcoin. The ETH/BTC pair has plummeted to 0.02195, its lowest level since June 2020. At that time, Ethereum’s decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem was still in its infancy, with just $2 billion in total value locked (TVL). On-chain data from IntoTheBlock has revealed a critical resistance zone between $2,200 and $2,580, where 12.43 million wallets hold 66.18 million ETH. A breakout above this level could trigger a short squeeze and reignite bullish momentum, but for now, the path of least resistance remains downward.

It has soared for five consecutive weeks, making it one of the year’s best-performing assets. In contrast, the crypto market continues to implode, with its marke cap plunging by over $1 trillion in the past few months. Gold Price Surges Ahead of Liberation Day The price of XAU/USD has continued surging as gold became the most popular safe haven asset this year. Investors are afraid of Donald Trump’s Liberation Day , where he will unveil reciprocal tariffs against most of the US trade partners. He has already announced other substantial tariffs in the past few weeks. Just last week, he announced 25% tariffs on all imported automobiles and parts. He also announced 25% tariffs on all imported steel and aluminum, and a similar amount for all goods imported from Canada and Mexico. Gold price is, therefore, rising as investors rush to its safety since it has played a safe haven role in the last decades. Besides, data shows that more countries like Russia, Turkey, and China have continued to boost their gold purchases. Gold has also jumped as investors anticipate weaker relations between the US and other countries. For example, there are signs that talks between the US and Russia are not going on well, with reports saying that Trump was ‘very angry’ with Putin as the ceasefire negotiations continue. Therefore, gold price is soaring amid a confluence of bullish catalysts like safe-haven demand, central bank purchases, and rising tensions between the US and other countries. Gold Price Chart XAU/USD Technical Analysis Technicals and trend-following principles show that the gold price will likely keep rising for a while. It has already jumped above the key resistance level at $2,787, the upper side of an ascending triangle pattern. Gold has remained above the 50-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Also, the Average Directional Index (ADX) has jumped to 47, a sign that the momentum is gaining steam. Therefore, gold prices will likely continue soaring, with the next point to watch being at $3,500. A crash below the support at $2,787 will invalidate the bullish outlook. Why Crypto Market is Crashing Crypto Market Has Crashed Interestingly, the gold price surge happened as the crypto market imploded. Bitcoin price has crashed from the year-to-date high of $109,300 to $82,000. Prices of other coins like Ethereum, XRP, and Shiba Inu have plunged . These coins have plunged because of the rising fear that Trump’s tariffs may lead to a recession in the United States and other countries. Their crash is a sign that Bitcoin is not a safe haven asset as some analysts have argued in the past. Still, on the positive side, there is a likelihood that Bitcoin and other players in the crypto market will bounce back once the dust settles. That’s because, historically, risky assets do well when there is a recession because the Federal Reserve intervenes by cutting interest rates and implementing quantitative easing.

Recently, the spotlight was on the launch of the Solana futures ETF . However, the initial reception seems to have been quieter than many expected. Let’s dive into the details and understand what this muted debut means for the future of Solana and crypto ETFs in general. Solana Futures ETF: A Subdued Start According to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, the newly launched Solana futures ETF experienced a rather uneventful first few days of trading. Balchunas, known for his insightful analysis of the ETF market, shared on X (formerly Twitter) that the ETF recorded a trading volume of just $1 million. While $1 million might sound like a substantial figure in isolation, within the vast world of ETFs, and especially when compared to the explosive launches of Bitcoin ETFs, it paints a picture of a lukewarm reception. But why is this the case? Let’s explore the factors at play. Bitcoin ETF Mania vs. Solana Futures ETF Reality To truly understand the context of the Solana futures ETF debut, it’s crucial to compare it with the phenomenon that was the Bitcoin ETF launch. When Bitcoin spot ETFs finally hit the market, they sparked a frenzy. Billions of dollars poured in, and trading volumes were astronomical. This monumental success set a high benchmark and created expectations for subsequent crypto-related ETF launches. However, as Balchunas astutely pointed out, the excitement and demand tend to diminish as products move further away from Bitcoin. Here’s a quick comparison to highlight the difference: ETF Type Initial Hype First Few Days Trading Volume (Approx.) Market Sentiment Bitcoin ETF (Spot) Extreme Billions of dollars Euphoric, highly bullish Solana Futures ETF Moderate to High $1 million Cautious, realistic This table clearly illustrates the stark contrast. While a $1 million volume is typical for many standard ETFs launching in traditional markets, the crypto space operates on a different level of volatility and hype, particularly around flagship assets like Bitcoin. The muted response to the Solana futures ETF raises some important questions. Why the Muted Debut of Solana Futures ETF? Several factors could be contributing to the less-than-stellar launch of the Solana futures ETF : Bitcoin’s Dominance: Bitcoin remains the king of crypto. It enjoys unparalleled brand recognition and institutional adoption. Products directly linked to Bitcoin naturally attract more attention and investment. Futures vs. Spot: While Bitcoin spot ETFs were highly anticipated, futures ETFs, even for Bitcoin, have historically seen less demand. Futures contracts can be more complex for some investors to understand compared to directly holding the underlying asset. This complexity might extend to crypto ETF investors as well. Solana’s Market Position: While Solana is a prominent cryptocurrency and a strong contender in the Layer-1 blockchain space, it doesn’t yet command the same level of mainstream recognition or institutional confidence as Bitcoin. Market Saturation: The ETF market, even within crypto, is becoming increasingly crowded. Investors now have a wider array of choices, and their capital might be spread across different products rather than concentrated in a few. Broader Market Sentiment: The overall market sentiment towards cryptocurrencies can fluctuate. While there’s long-term bullishness, short-term corrections or periods of uncertainty can dampen enthusiasm for new investment products. Is This a Setback for Solana and Crypto ETFs? It’s crucial to avoid jumping to conclusions based on initial trading volumes. A muted debut doesn’t necessarily spell doom for the Solana futures ETF or for the broader category of crypto ETFs beyond Bitcoin. Here’s why: Early Days: ETF launches often take time to gain traction. It can take weeks or even months for trading volumes to ramp up as investors become more aware and comfortable with the product. Long-Term Potential of Solana: Solana’s technology is highly regarded for its speed and scalability. If Solana continues to grow and gain adoption, interest in Solana-related investment products, including ETFs, could increase significantly over time. Expanding Crypto ETF Universe: The launch of a Solana futures ETF , even with a slow start, is a positive step for the crypto industry. It signifies the gradual expansion of regulated investment vehicles for digital assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. Investor Education: As investors become more educated about cryptocurrencies and the nuances of different crypto assets, demand for diversified crypto ETF products could rise. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors What can crypto investors learn from the Solana futures ETF ‘s debut? Manage Expectations: Don’t expect every crypto ETF launch to replicate the Bitcoin ETF frenzy. Different cryptocurrencies have different levels of market appeal and investor base. Diversification Matters: Consider crypto ETFs as part of a diversified investment strategy. Don’t put all your eggs in one basket, whether it’s a single cryptocurrency or a single type of ETF. Long-Term Perspective: Crypto investing is often a long-term game. Evaluate the underlying technology and potential of the cryptocurrencies represented in ETFs, rather than focusing solely on short-term trading volumes. Due Diligence: Always do your own research before investing in any ETF or cryptocurrency. Understand the risks and potential rewards involved. The Future of Crypto ETFs: Beyond Bitcoin The initial response to the Solana futures ETF serves as a sobering reminder that while Bitcoin remains the dominant force, the crypto ETF landscape is evolving. The journey beyond Bitcoin ETFs will likely be characterized by more measured growth and varying levels of investor interest depending on the specific cryptocurrency and market conditions. However, the continued expansion of crypto ETF offerings is a positive sign for the maturity and mainstream adoption of the digital asset class. The future may not be solely about Bitcoin; it’s about building a diverse and robust ecosystem of crypto investment products.

With countless coins flooding the market, the need for innovation and strong fundamentals has never been more important. Enter Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) – a project that promises big rewards and a deflationary approach that could make early investors very happy. This article will cover the developments and updates of all three coins: Arctic Pablo, Ponke, and Just a Chill Guy. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Presale Sensation with Unbeatable Potential Are you ready to stake, compete, and burn your way to massive gains? Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is redefining how presales are structured, offering an investment opportunity that is unlike anything you’ve seen before. Right now, the Arctic Pablo Coin presale is live, and it’s nothing short of spectacular. Investors can earn rewards through staking with an impressive APY of 66% during the meme coin presale period. What’s more, by spreading the word about APC, investors can rake in referral incentives, further amplifying their returns. But that’s not all. Arctic Pablo’s token burn mechanism is creating a deflationary environment that’s bound to boost the value of APC over time. Unsold tokens are permanently burned every week during the presale, and tokens left after the presale will follow the same fate. This creates a scarcity factor, which bodes well for investors looking for long-term gains. All of this is happening on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), making transactions smooth and efficient. Currently, Arctic Pablo Coin is in the 16th phase of its presale journey at the Crystal Cove location. One APC is priced at just $0.000083, and early investors are looking at a potential 9552.41% ROI when the coin reaches its launch price of $0.008. With over $2 million already raised, the presale is heating up, and the price will only increase as Arctic Pablo travels through different locations. Now’s the time to get in at this low price, as the clock ticks on this limited-time opportunity. Arctic Pablo Presale: The Clock Is Ticking, Don’t Miss Out on These Gains! As Arctic Pablo Coin makes its way through different locations, the presale is following a unique structure – no stages, just a thrilling journey as the coin “travels” to new territories. At the moment, Arctic Pablo is at Crystal Cove, with only a few locations left. The presale has already raised over $2 million, proving that there’s serious interest in Arctic Pablo’s future. It’s clear that this coin has captured the attention of investors. If you’re looking for a meme coin with a lot of upside potential, Arctic Pablo is the one to watch. As the project continues its journey through its presale phases, don’t let the chance slip away to secure your stake in one of the top new meme coins to buy today. Ponke: A Memeworthy Player in the Crypto Space Ponke has recently made headlines for its innovative approach to decentralized finance. The project has caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts due to its robust tokenomics and a roadmap that shows promise for long-term growth. While Ponke’s presale is in full swing, the excitement surrounding its launch is palpable, especially with a strong community backing it. As Ponke continues to evolve, many are eager to see how it will carve out its niche in the competitive meme coin market. Just a Chill Guy: New Developments and Growing Popularity Just a Chill Guy is gaining traction in the meme coin sector, with its lighthearted approach to crypto taking the market by storm. The coin’s community is known for its unique memes and strong social media presence, making it a favorite among meme coin enthusiasts.

42703934,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144776,1743435942,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Groundbreaking Alliance: Cardano and Ripple Explore RLUSD Integration,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/cardano-ripple-rlusd-integration/,"In a surprising turn of events, the cryptocurrency world is buzzing with news of a potential collaboration between two major players. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently revealed that he’s now in direct communication with Ripple, including CEO Brad Garlinghouse. This marks a significant shift, considering the past competitive landscape between Cardano and Ripple. The exciting development? Discussions are underway to bring Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, to the Cardano network. Let’s dive into what this could mean for both ecosystems and the broader crypto space. The Cardano – Ripple Reconciliation: A New Chapter in Crypto? For years, Cardano and Ripple have been perceived as competitors in the blockchain arena. However, the recent announcement from Charles Hoskinson signals a move towards collaboration. In a recent podcast, Hoskinson shared that he is now on friendly terms with Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, marking a significant change in their relationship. This newfound camaraderie opens doors for potential synergies, with the first tangible outcome being the exploration of integrating Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD, into the Cardano ecosystem. But what led to this unexpected alliance? Shifting Priorities: The cryptocurrency landscape is constantly evolving. Perhaps both Cardano and Ripple recognize the benefits of collaboration over competition in navigating regulatory hurdles and fostering wider adoption. Shared Vision: Despite their different approaches, both Cardano and Ripple aim to contribute to a more decentralized and efficient financial system. Finding common ground in this vision could be a driving force behind this collaboration. Maturity of the Crypto Space: As the crypto industry matures, there’s a growing understanding that collaboration and interoperability are key to mainstream success. This integration could be a reflection of this broader trend. This shift in dynamics is not just about two entities coming together; it represents a potential paradigm shift in how blockchain projects interact and build the future of finance. The implications of this friendly relationship could extend beyond just stablecoin integration, potentially paving the way for further collaborations in the future. Unveiling Ripple RLUSD: What is it and Why Cardano? At the heart of this potential partnership lies Ripple’s stablecoin, RLUSD. But what exactly is RLUSD, and why is its integration into Cardano such a noteworthy development? What is Ripple RLUSD? RLUSD, presumably short for Ripple USD, is Ripple’s foray into the stablecoin market. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They are crucial for the crypto ecosystem as they offer stability amidst the volatile nature of other cryptocurrencies, facilitating trading, lending, and various DeFi activities. While details about RLUSD are still emerging, it’s expected to offer the reliability and efficiency associated with Ripple’s technology. Why Cardano for RLUSD Integration? Cardano presents a compelling platform for stablecoin integration due to several factors: Factor Description Robust Infrastructure Cardano’s architecture, built with a focus on security and scalability, provides a solid foundation for stablecoins like RLUSD. Growing DeFi Ecosystem Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem is expanding rapidly. Integrating RLUSD could inject significant liquidity and utility into Cardano’s decentralized finance applications. Community Support Cardano boasts a strong and active community that is always eager for new developments and integrations that enhance the network’s capabilities. Interoperability Focus Cardano’s commitment to interoperability aligns well with the idea of integrating assets from different ecosystems, making RLUSD a potentially synergistic addition. By bringing RLUSD to Cardano, Ripple could tap into a vibrant and growing ecosystem, while Cardano users would gain access to a potentially robust and widely accepted stablecoin. This integration is a win-win proposition, enhancing the utility and reach of both networks. The Power of Stablecoin Integration: Benefits for the Cardano Ecosystem The integration of a stablecoin like RLUSD into Cardano’s ecosystem could unlock a plethora of benefits. Stablecoins are the backbone of many cryptocurrency transactions, and their presence on Cardano can significantly enhance its functionality and appeal. Let’s explore some key advantages: Enhanced Liquidity: RLUSD would introduce new liquidity to the Cardano network. This increased liquidity is vital for DeFi protocols, making trading and lending activities more efficient and attractive. Boost to DeFi Applications: Stablecoins are fundamental for DeFi. RLUSD integration can fuel the growth of Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem by providing a stable and reliable asset for lending, borrowing, yield farming, and other decentralized financial services. Improved User Experience: For Cardano users, having access to RLUSD simplifies transactions and reduces exposure to the volatility often associated with cryptocurrencies. It makes Cardano more user-friendly for everyday transactions and investments. Increased Adoption: The availability of a reputable stablecoin can attract new users and developers to the Cardano platform. It lowers the barrier to entry for those who are hesitant due to crypto volatility. Facilitating Cross-Chain Activity: While the initial integration is within Cardano, RLUSD could potentially facilitate smoother cross-chain interactions in the future, further connecting Cardano to the wider crypto landscape. In essence, stablecoin integration is not just about adding another asset; it’s about enriching the entire Cardano ecosystem, making it more robust, versatile, and appealing to a broader audience. The potential for growth and innovation is substantial. Charles Hoskinson on Collaboration and the Future of Crypto Charles Hoskinson’s openness to collaboration, as evidenced by his discussions with Ripple, reflects a broader trend in the cryptocurrency industry. He has consistently emphasized the importance of working together to achieve mainstream adoption and overcome industry-wide challenges. What does this shift in perspective mean for the future of crypto? Hoskinson’s recent comments highlight a few key themes: Collaboration over Competition: The crypto space is no longer a zero-sum game. Hoskinson’s willingness to engage with former competitors like Ripple suggests a growing recognition that collaboration can lead to greater collective success. Focus on Interoperability: The future of blockchain is likely to be multi-chain. Integration efforts like RLUSD on Cardano point towards a move towards greater interoperability, allowing different blockchain ecosystems to interact seamlessly. Building Bridges, Not Walls: Hoskinson’s approach emphasizes building bridges between different crypto communities and technologies. This collaborative spirit is crucial for fostering innovation and driving mainstream adoption. Pragmatism and Progress: While Cardano and Ripple may have had different paths in the past, focusing on practical integrations like RLUSD demonstrates a pragmatic approach to driving progress and delivering tangible benefits to users. Hoskinson’s vision of a more collaborative and interconnected crypto world is gaining traction. The potential integration of RLUSD on Cardano is a testament to this evolving mindset, showcasing the power of unity in the pursuit of a decentralized future. Navigating Challenges and the Road Ahead for Crypto Collaboration While the prospect of Cardano and Ripple collaborating is exciting, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations moving forward. Successful **crypto collaboration**, especially involving stablecoin integrations, requires careful planning and execution. What hurdles might they face, and what steps are crucial for success? Potential Challenges: Regulatory Scrutiny: Stablecoins are under increasing regulatory attention globally. Both Ripple and Cardano need to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape to ensure compliance for RLUSD integration. Technical Integration: Integrating RLUSD seamlessly into the Cardano network requires technical expertise and coordination. Ensuring smooth functionality and security is paramount. Community Alignment: While generally positive, both Cardano and Ripple communities need to be aligned and supportive of this collaboration for it to thrive. Clear communication and addressing community concerns are essential. Long-Term Vision: Beyond the initial integration, a long-term vision for collaboration is needed. Defining shared goals and areas of future cooperation will ensure sustained success. Actionable Insights for Success: Transparency and Communication: Open and transparent communication with both communities about the integration process, timelines, and benefits is crucial. Robust Security Measures: Prioritizing security at every stage of the integration process is non-negotiable to protect users and maintain trust. Community Engagement: Actively engaging with both Cardano and Ripple communities, seeking feedback, and addressing concerns will foster a sense of ownership and support. Iterative Development: Adopting an iterative approach to development, with phased rollouts and continuous improvements, can mitigate risks and ensure a smooth integration. Overcoming these challenges requires a proactive and collaborative approach. By prioritizing transparency, security, and community engagement, Cardano and Ripple can pave the way for a successful RLUSD integration and set a positive precedent for future crypto collaborations. Conclusion: A Promising Future of Unity in Crypto The news of Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson and Ripple engaging in friendly discussions, with the potential integration of RLUSD on Cardano, marks a potentially groundbreaking moment for the cryptocurrency industry. This **stablecoin integration** is more than just a technical development; it symbolizes a shift towards collaboration, interoperability, and a unified vision for the future of crypto. By bridging divides and working together, projects like Cardano and Ripple can accelerate the journey towards mainstream adoption and unlock the full potential of blockchain technology. The exciting prospect of RLUSD on Cardano offers a glimpse into a future where collaboration triumphs over competition, benefiting users, developers, and the entire crypto ecosystem.

Was it just inflation data, or is something bigger happening behind the scenes? Table of Contents Bitcoin’s coldest Q1 in 7 years Decoding the crypto slide What consumer confidence says about crypto’s next moves Further declines ahead? Bitcoin’s coldest Q1 in 7 years Just three months ago, the atmosphere in the crypto market was electric. Bitcoin ( BTC ) had surged past $109,000, Ethereum ( ETH ) was holding strong, and a fresh wave of optimism swept through the space, buoyed by the return of pro-crypto Donald Trump to the White House. But as we close out Q1 2025, that optimism has quietly faded into uncertainty. As of Mar. 31, Bitcoin is trading around $82,000, marking a nearly 13% drop for the quarter. It’s on track to register its weakest Q1 performance in seven years, ending a two-year run of solid first-quarter gains. To put that into perspective, Bitcoin jumped 72% in Q1 2023 and climbed another 69% in Q1 2024. The last time it faltered this badly in the first quarter was in 2018, when it plunged nearly 50% during the fallout of the ICO boom. Ethereum, however, is facing a much steeper decline. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap has lost a staggering 46.4% this quarter, now trading near $1,800. That’s nearly identical to its 46.6% drop in Q1 2018, making this its worst first-quarter performance in seven years. Yet when we zoom out, a more nuanced picture begins to emerge. Between 2017 and 2025, Bitcoin has ended Q1 in the red four times out of nine, while Ethereum has seen three losing Q1s in the same stretch. What makes this particular downturn stand out is the broader backdrop: persistent inflation, fragile investor confidence, and intensifying geopolitical risks. So the question now is — was this just a seasonal slip, or a sign of deeper trouble ahead? Could prices rebound as the macro environment shifts in crypto’s favor? Let’s take a closer look. Decoding the crypto slide On Mar. 28, the crypto market took a sharp hit after the U.S. released February’s core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index — a key inflation metric closely monitored by the Federal Reserve. The year-over-year increase came in at 2.8%, slightly above the expected 2.7%, but just enough to unsettle investors. Unlike headline inflation, core PCE strips out the noise of food and energy prices, offering a clearer view of persistent pricing trends. And that clear view revealed that inflation isn’t cooling as quickly as markets had hoped. This inflation surprise landed just as concerns over global trade were heating up. President Donald Trump’s hardline tariff strategy has introduced a fresh wave of macroeconomic tension. It began in early February with a 25% tariff threat targeting Canadian and Mexican goods. That was quickly followed by a sweeping 20% tariff on all Chinese imports, driven by allegations of Beijing’s role in fentanyl trafficking. From steel and aluminum to automobiles and even Venezuelan oil, few sectors have been spared. The administration has released a list of around 15 countries — labeled the “Dirty 15” — that could soon face reciprocal tariffs based on imbalances and geopolitical friction. The global pushback has been fast and forceful. China responded with tariffs on American agricultural exports. The EU is preparing a multi-phase duty plan covering roughly $28 billion in U.S. goods. Canada hit back with CAD $60 billion in retaliatory duties, while Mexico is said to be finalizing its own measures for early April. Markets, unsurprisingly, didn’t take the uncertainty well. Both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 dropped over 2% the day the PCE data was released, wiping out more than $1 trillion in market cap between them. Crypto was pulled down in the broader risk-off move. As investor nerves frayed, assets like ETH, Ripple ( XRP ), Solana ( SOL ), and other altcoins shed their recent gains, while Bitcoin struggled under intensifying macro pressure. According to Glassnode, most of the recent sales have come from short-term holders — those who have bought Bitcoin within the past five months and are now reacting to price swings.

With long-term inflation expectations now spiking to 4.1% — their highest level since 1993 — many traders have shifted to a defensive stance, moving capital into cash. Just three months ago, before the tariff rollout, those expectations were closer to 2.6%. Hours later, UMich inflation expectations data was released. Long-term US inflation expectations officially surged to 4.1%, the highest level since 1993. Previously, rising inflation had fairly clear consequences for the market. This changed after GDPNow data on Friday. pic.twitter.com/0Qh3AqouDM — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 29, 2025 What consumer confidence says about crypto’s next moves According to the Conference Board, U.S. consumer sentiment continued its downward slide in March. The Consumer Confidence Index, released on March 25, fell for the fourth consecutive month, landing at 92.9. More concerning, however, was the drop in the Expectations Index, which plunged 9.6 points to 65.2. That’s its lowest reading since 2013 and far below the 80-point threshold that’s often seen as a warning sign of an impending recession. The Expectations Index gauges how households view income, business conditions, and job prospects in the coming months. A drop to these levels suggests people are recalibrating their outlook. And when expectations dim, risk behavior tends to shift just as quickly. That growing caution is starting to appear in markets. Only 37.4% of survey participants now believe stock prices will rise over the next year — a sharp 10-point decline from February and the steepest monthly drop in more than a year. At the same time, optimism about jobs is fading . The percentage of consumers expecting more jobs fell from 18.8% to 16.7%, while those anticipating fewer jobs climbed to 28.5%. It’s a climate that doesn’t support risk-heavy bets. With inflation still running hot and global trade uncertainty on the rise, investors are pulling back — and crypto is among the first to feel the pressure. Risk appetite is cooling, and capital is starting to shift toward safer, more defensive plays. Further declines ahead? As Q1 draws to a close on a downbeat note for both crypto and traditional markets, the big question now is what comes next? Across the board, we’re seeing signs of fatigue. U.S. equities, in particular, are flashing broader weakness. “S&P 500 futures officially entered correction territory,” noted The Kobeissi Letter, highlighting that more than $2.7 trillion in market cap was erased over just four trading sessions. BREAKING: S&P 500 futures officially enter correction territory, bringing 4-day market cap losses to -$2.7 trillion. The Nasdaq 100 is now just 5.5% away from entering a bear market. pic.twitter.com/zKYpmAnLX0 — The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter) March 31, 2025 The Nasdaq 100, meanwhile, is teetering just 5.5% above official bear market levels. That’s significant because crypto, especially Bitcoin, has grown increasingly correlated with tech-heavy, risk-on assets. When the Nasdaq falters, crypto often follows suit. Even major institutional buys aren’t reversing the trend. MicroStrategy’s latest move — purchasing $1.92 billion worth of Bitcoin and adding over 22,000 BTC to its holdings failed to stem the slide. “Saylor just added 22,048 BTC… but Bitcoin still closed the week in red,” observed CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, pointing to the strength of macro headwinds weighing on the market.

Gold’s relative strength versus Bitcoin has been climbing steadily. For the first time in over a decade, the GOLD/BTC ratio has broken out of a 12-year downtrend, prompting questions about how crypto is being repriced amid growing macro uncertainty. GOLD/BTC breaking a 12 year downtrend pic.twitter.com/zlX4wWKpKS — Joe Carlasare (@JoeCarlasare) March 31, 2025 As a traditional safe-haven, gold appears to be attracting renewed interest, potentially drawing capital away from riskier assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ethereum, in particular, is under added pressure. Technical analyst Michaël van de Poppe described its price structure as deeply concerning: “A massively disastrous chart for ETH,” he noted, suggesting Ethereum’s local bottom may coincide with gold’s recent strength. A massively disastrous chart for $ETH . I don't know where this will bottom, although I suspect that the peak of Gold and the bottom of Ethereum are going to be correlated. pic.twitter.com/78r7uaXYLK — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) March 29, 2025 Economic forecasts are also leaning cautious. Goldman Sachs recently raised its U.S. recession probability to 35%, up from 20%, driven by concerns that tariffs and tighter financial conditions could hamper growth more than expected. Still, a possible shift may be underway. Julien Bittel, head of macro research at Global Macro Investor, believes some of the worst-case scenarios may already be priced in. He explains that financial conditions tend to hit markets with a lag of 10 to 12 weeks, and the current Q1 volatility likely stems from the policy tightening seen in Q4 2024. Supporting that view, recent declines in the U.S. dollar, bond yields, and one-year inflation breakevens hint that markets may be moving beyond peak stress. “There may still be a near-term chop or a final dip into the April 2 tariff announcement,” Bittel added, “but the path of least resistance after that feels higher.” He sees April as a potential turning point, particularly if macro data improves and liquidity begins to ease. If macro conditions stabilize, inflation expectations retreat, and financial liquidity returns, crypto could benefit from a rebound in risk appetite. But if the tariff standoff worsens or recession fears deepen, the market may stay under pressure, especially with a high number of short-term holders still active and reactive. Still, caution remains warranted. The market is in a phase where positive catalysts need time to translate into price action, and confidence is slow to return.

UK-regulated crypto exchange Archax is making a bold move across the pond, setting its sights on the lucrative US market. In a groundbreaking development, Archax has acquired Globacap Private Markets Inc., a firm regulated by both FINRA and the SEC. This strategic acquisition isn’t just about expansion; it’s a powerful statement of intent to revolutionize the landscape of tokenized assets for institutional players. Archax’s Strategic US Expansion: A New Chapter Unfolds The acquisition, as reported by CoinDesk, marks a significant milestone for Archax. By rebranding Globacap Private Markets Inc. as Archax Markets US, the company is establishing a firm foothold in the United States. But why is this such a big deal? Let’s break it down: Direct Access to the US Institutional Market: The US represents the world’s largest institutional investment market. This move provides Archax with direct access to a vast pool of professional investors eager to explore the potential of digital assets. Regulatory Compliance from Day One: Acquiring a FINRA- and SEC-regulated entity means Archax bypasses the often lengthy and complex process of obtaining US regulatory approvals from scratch. This accelerates their entry and builds immediate trust. Amplifying Tokenized Asset Services: Archax’s core mission is to bridge the gap between traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset space. This expansion allows them to amplify their offerings in tokenized assets specifically tailored for institutional needs within the US market. Think of it as Archax laying down a crucial piece of infrastructure in the global crypto exchange ecosystem. They aren’t just dipping their toes; they are diving in headfirst with a regulated entity ready to operate. Unlocking the Potential of Tokenized Real-World Assets for Institutions At the heart of Archax’s US venture lies the promise of tokenized assets , often referred to as Real-World Assets (RWAs). But what exactly are these, and why are institutions so interested? Tokenized Real-World Assets (RWAs) Explained: RWAs are essentially traditional assets – think real estate, bonds, commodities, art, and even private equity – represented digitally on a blockchain. This “tokenization” process unlocks a range of benefits that traditional finance often struggles to provide. Why Institutional Investors are Paying Attention: Institutional investors , from pension funds to hedge funds, are increasingly exploring digital assets for diversification and enhanced returns. Tokenized assets offer compelling advantages that align with their investment objectives: Increased Liquidity: RWAs, traditionally illiquid, become more easily tradable when tokenized. This opens up new investment avenues and allows for faster portfolio adjustments. Fractional Ownership: Tokenization enables fractional ownership of high-value assets. Institutions can gain exposure to assets like prime real estate or fine art with smaller capital outlays, democratizing access. Enhanced Transparency and Efficiency: Blockchain technology provides a transparent and immutable record of ownership and transactions, reducing settlement times and operational complexities. 24/7 Trading: Unlike traditional markets with set trading hours, digital asset markets operate around the clock, offering greater flexibility for global institutional investors . Potential for Higher Yields: The nascent market for tokenized assets presents opportunities for early adopters to potentially capture higher yields compared to saturated traditional markets. The move by Archax to focus on tokenized assets in the US market is strategically astute, aligning with the growing institutional appetite for these innovative financial instruments. Navigating the US Regulatory Landscape: FINRA and SEC Scrutiny Operating within the US financial market demands strict adherence to regulatory frameworks. Archax’s acquisition of Globacap, a regulated entity, is a masterstroke in navigating this complex terrain. Let’s understand why FINRA and SEC regulation is paramount: FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority): FINRA is a self-regulatory organization that oversees brokerage firms and brokers in the US. FINRA regulation ensures investor protection and market integrity within the securities industry. SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission): The SEC is the primary US government agency responsible for enforcing securities laws and regulating the securities industry. SEC oversight is crucial for maintaining fair and orderly markets and protecting investors from fraud and manipulation. By acquiring a firm already under the watchful eyes of FINRA and the SEC, Archax signals its commitment to operating within the bounds of US law and building trust with institutional investors who prioritize regulatory compliance. Benefits of Tokenized Assets for Institutional Investors: A Deeper Dive Let’s delve deeper into the specific advantages that tokenized assets bring to the table for institutional investors : Benefit Description Impact for Institutional Investors Enhanced Liquidity Tokenization breaks down large, illiquid assets into smaller, tradable units. Easier entry and exit from positions, improved portfolio diversification, and potential for faster capital deployment. Reduced Costs Blockchain-based systems can streamline processes, reducing intermediaries and associated fees. Lower transaction costs, improved operational efficiency, and potentially higher net returns. Greater Accessibility Tokenization can democratize access to previously exclusive asset classes. Opportunity to diversify into new asset classes like private equity or high-end real estate with lower minimum investment thresholds. Increased Transparency Blockchain provides a transparent and auditable record of ownership and transactions. Enhanced trust and accountability, reduced counterparty risk, and improved regulatory compliance. Smart Contract Functionality Tokenized assets can be programmed with smart contracts to automate various processes. Automated dividend distribution, streamlined compliance procedures, and potential for more complex and innovative financial products. These benefits collectively paint a compelling picture for institutional investors seeking to optimize their portfolios and explore new avenues for growth in the digital age. Challenges and Opportunities in the Tokenized Asset Market While the potential of tokenized assets is immense, the journey is not without its challenges. Understanding both the hurdles and the opportunities is crucial for navigating this evolving market: Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for digital assets, including tokenized assets , is still evolving globally, including in the US. Clarity and consistency are needed to foster widespread adoption. Adoption Hurdles: Institutional adoption of tokenized assets is still in its early stages. Education, standardization, and robust infrastructure are necessary to overcome inertia and encourage broader participation. Security Concerns: While blockchain is inherently secure, vulnerabilities can exist in smart contracts and custody solutions. Ensuring the security and safety of tokenized assets is paramount for institutional investors. Interoperability Issues: Lack of interoperability between different blockchain platforms and token standards can create fragmentation and hinder seamless trading and transfer of tokenized assets . Opportunities: First-MMover Advantage: Institutions that embrace tokenized assets early can gain a competitive edge by accessing new markets, improving efficiency, and potentially generating higher returns. Market Growth Potential: The market for tokenized assets is projected to experience significant growth in the coming years as adoption increases and regulatory frameworks mature. Innovation and New Product Development: Tokenization unlocks opportunities for creating innovative financial products and services that were previously impossible in traditional finance. Democratization of Finance: Tokenization has the potential to democratize access to investment opportunities and financial services, benefiting both institutions and individual investors alike. Archax Leading the Charge in Tokenized Asset Services With its US expansion , Archax is positioning itself as a leader in the burgeoning tokenized asset space. Their strategic move demonstrates a clear vision for the future of finance, one where digital assets and traditional markets converge. By focusing on institutional investors and prioritizing regulatory compliance, Archax is building a robust and trusted platform for the next generation of financial services. The acquisition of Globacap and the launch of Archax Markets US is more than just a business transaction; it’s a bold step towards realizing the transformative potential of tokenized assets and ushering in a new era of efficiency, accessibility, and innovation in the financial world.

Technical indicators reveal a break of a three-month descending trendline, with little opposing movement up to $0.31. But quietly dominating presale traction is MUTM, Mutuum Finance, raising $5.9 million with 7,600 holders. MUTM’s Phase 4 presale fills up for $0.025, 20% discount before its next price increase while DOGE whales accrue 200 Million. Notably, early investors banked on MUTM breaking the $0.06 listing target, promising a return of 140% and well beyond even the most unreasonable DOGE predictions. Speculative Push for Dogecoin Whales and technical breaks play vital role in Dogecoin recovery juxtapose to all-time high In two weeks 200 million tokens have been added, with large holders controlling 10.5 billion DOGE — a confidence boost ahead of the predicted rally in April. A supply gap between $0.20 and $0.31 capacity can prop up prices, analysts say, indicating a 55% surge potential should buyers maintain momentum. That transaction from the House of Doge was for 10 million DOGE and has led to the $0.80 and $6.00 targets. But DOGE’s dependence on meme-fueled speculation stands in stark contrast to Mutuum Finance’s methodical scaling. While it has broken important resistance levels, Dogecoin, like much-hyped assets, can be subject to volatility pressures. The 2025 peak predictions for this are therefore muted next to the calculated presale growth of MUTM – reward secured before token purchase, back-end rewards guaranteed once the tokens list. Mutuum Finance’s Dominance in the Presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) resumes its 11 Phased presale in Phase 4, with tokens priced at $0.025 before they go up 20% to $0.03. Meanwhile, over 7,600 holders have already taken positions in the platform, thanks to its lending protocols and mechanics that exert buy pressure. The price listing for tokens is $0.06, meaning investors should secure a 140% return at the time of launch. Forecasts are predicting a move to $3.50 after launch — a 13,900% increase from this phase. In contrast to Dogecoin’s arbitrary price fluctuations, MUTM’s returns are founded in tokenomics that are fully transparent. A percentage of platform revenue is used to repurchase tokens, reallocating wealth to stakers and preventing sell pressure. This model creates demand, making MUTM a hedge against meme coins’ highly volatile nature. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is in the final stages of a Certik audit for its smart contracts, with security being a top priority. In return for results, the team plans to announce publicly and further build investor trust in its decentralized lending ecosystem. Such steps set MUTM apart from those projects whose being is completely based on community hype and show that DeFi is going in the right direction of transparency. Why Timing Matters Now A breach of $0.31 — a feat that necessitates continued whale support — is key to Dogecoin’s April rally. On the other hand, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) guarantees returns at every stage of the presale, with Phase 4 filling up fast. Miss $0.025 before the climb to $0.03 with delayed entry. MUTM loyalists also hint at its utility-based model and deflationary token structure leading to a trajectory that ends up doing what DOGE didn’t do after its initial launch. As Dogecoin follows its speculative heights, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) provides quantifiable increases through zoned pre-sales. In addition to benefiting from launch listings, steer the price target of the round to build a position in a platform combining lending utility with buy side pressure. With a unique combination of growth and stability, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) marries DeFi innovation with investor first approach. As Dogecoin struggles against its resistance levels, the presale for MUTM is ensured by compounding on each phase. Join before prices are pumped again, visit Mutuum Finance’s official channels today.

The far-fetched claim is rooted in what Good prognosticates as unvarnished reality: Bitcoin's encryption mechanisms are ""getting really stale"" and could be ""completely obsolete within five years,"" creating a business conundrum for the miners behind it. ""You've got people who've invested billions of dollars in hash power for securing a network in ASICs,"" he told CoinDesk at this year's ethDenver conference. ""And the question is like, where do they all go?"" His answer is Ambient, a blockchain with deep capabilities in the AI space – the ""future economy,"" as Good puts it – that could become a ""decentralized competitor to OpenAI."" The network operates on a proof-of-work mechanism with familiar appeal to bitcoin miners, he said, making it an easy switch. ""It's a useful proof of work network, which we don't think anyone has ever done well in crypto,"" Good said. Many crypto projects have attempted to fuse the two buzzy tech trends on the belief that blockchains and decentralized crowdsourcing can steer AI better toward delivering for humanity than singular, private corporations possibly could. One of the biggest and best-funded is Bittensor . But Good claims the market leader is woefully deficient because it doesn't actually run AI models on blockchain, despite its original intention to ""be this global computer."" His alternative, Ambient, cooks AI into its core. Whether Bitcoin miners – let alone users – would actually embrace a radically new and different network likely hinges on Ambient's economic success. Good seeks for Ambient to deliver super-intelligent AI fast, cheap, and critically, in the open, so that users get the answers they paid for. While Ambient's security rhymes with Bitcoin's, the network itself runs like Solana. Ambient raised $7.2 million in seed funding from a16z's crypto accelerator program as well as Delphi Digital, one of the VC world's hungriest funds for crypto-AI crossover tech. ""Everyone in crypto is currently using centralized AI to power their apps, to power their frontend,"" said Alex Golding, a venture associate at Delphi. He thinks that's a big issue because it deprives users of understanding what the models are trained on and exposes them to getting hoodwinked with answers derived from inferior models. ""Verified inference"" by miners (the heart of their rewards mechanism) acts as a provenance fact-checker, ensuring that answers spat out by Ambient originate from the model people paid to use. ""If you don't have verified inference, you're guaranteed to get rugged,"" Good said, adding a hyperbolic warning: ""Nation state actors are going to poison your model and just do fun stuff, like we saw with Lazarus,"" North Korea's hackers.",Finance|A16z crypto|Fundraising|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|BITTENSOR,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-31 16:00:04

The latest win is Kentucky opting to drop its Coinbase staking lawsuit, a move that sees it join Vermont and South Carolina. Kentucky Dismisses Coinbase Staking Lawsuit According to an announcement on X, Kentucky has officially dismissed its staking lawsuit against Coinbase. The joint filing sees the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions bring the curtain down on its drawn-out case against Coinbase. Akin to its previous streaks, the recent dismissal was without prejudice, signaling the potential reintroduction of staking services for Coinbase users in the state. Vermont and South Carolina have dismissed their staking lawsuits against Coinbase with Kentucky joining the growing list. Kentucky’s case dismissal follows the signing of the Bitcoin Rights with both sides of the political divide stating that staking and mining are exempt from securities rules. Barely a week after the signing of the landmark legislation, Kentucky authorities formally ended the Coinbase staking case. Governor Andy Beshear’s Department of Financial Institutions has followed suit by dismissing Kentucky’s staking lawsuit against Coinbase, just as Vermont and South Carolina recently did,” said Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal on X. Grewal Calls For A New Approach Toward Staking Regulation On the backs of recent regulatory wins, Coinbase CLO is urging the US Congress to wade into staking regulation. Grewal criticized the present regulatory landscape marked by each state having regulatory authority to determine their staking rules. “Congress needs to end this litigation-driven, state-by-state approach with a federal market structure law ASAP,” said Grewal. While Grewal did not share insights into his proposal, the federal approach will standardize offerings while protecting consumers. Going forward, Grewal expressed optimism for more states to lift the ban on the top exchange staking services in the short-term. Continuing A Winning Streak Against Regulators Coinbase is racking up regulatory wins since its SEC case dismissal without prejudice. Seizing the initiative, the exchange has filed a FOIA request against the securities regulator. Similarly, Grewal has criticized the FDIC over its handling of an FOIA request, cementing its hawkish stance against regulators. Outside the US, Coinbase has re-entered India after exiting the country back in 2023. A planned purchase of Deribit is considered a massive win for the US-based exchange as it moves away from its legal travails.

This sudden breakdown comes after weeks of bullish dominance, leaving investors scrambling to answer one critical question: Is this a temporary dip or the start of a major trend reversal? With weakening momentum and key technical indicators flashing red, BNB charts are telling a worrisome story. The once-steady uptrend now faces its toughest test as the token struggles to maintain its footing in a suddenly bearish market. Bearish Pressure Builds: Are BNB Sellers Gaining Control? BNB’s price is facing growing bearish pressure after slipping below the crucial $605 level, signaling a potential shift in market momentum. The failed attempt to hold this key support has allowed sellers to take control, pushing BNB lower and raising concerns about a prolonged decline. Related Reading: BNB Bulls Take Charge: Price Rebounds Strongly After Recent Dip Technical indicators further confirm the increasing strength of sellers. The MACD has turned negative, indicating a loss of upward momentum, while the RSI is trending downward, suggesting that buying pressure is weakening. Additionally, trading volume remains low on attempted rebounds, highlighting a lack of conviction from bulls. If sellers maintain their grip, BNB could extend its decline toward the next major support zone around $531, which previously served as a short-term bounce level during past corrections. A break below this zone would solidify bearish dominance and cause a deeper decline to $500. Below $500, the next key level to watch is $454, representing a technical support area. Pushing below this level may trigger an extended sell-off, driving BNB toward other key support levels where traders may look for signs of reversal. What Needs To Happen For A Rebound For BNB to stage a meaningful recovery after breaking below $605, the bulls must reclaim key levels and generate strong buying momentum. Its first crucial step is stabilizing above $530, a short-term support zone that could provide the foundation for a reversal. Holding this level would signal that buyers are stepping in, preventing more declines. Related Reading: BNB Flips Solana’s Market Cap Amid Market Retrace – Breakout To $700 Coming? A sustained move back above $605 would be the next major confirmation of a recovery. Reclaiming this level as support might shift market sentiment in favor of the bulls and trigger renewed buying interest. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) needs to rebound from oversold conditions, while the MACD crossover into bullish territory would reinforce an upside move. For a stronger bullish outlook, BNB would need to push past $680, a level that previously acted as resistance. Breaking above this zone with increasing volume could confirm a trend reversal toward $724 and $795, marking a full recovery from recent losses.

Cambrian is joining a16z’s fourth accelerator cohort, CSX 04, in San Francisco with plans to launch its testnet and mainnet later this year, crypto.news can exclusively report. Cambrian also received funding from Stanford’s Blockchain Builder’s Fund and other angel investors. Cambrian’s goal is to empower artificial intelligence agents, autonomous financial bots and tools with verifiable high-quality onchain and offchain data, to make smarter, risk-aware decisions in real time. Its network aggregates data such as blockchain activity, market pricing, and social sentiment, and offers a consensus mechanism to validate this information for agents that require verified data inputs. Built by AI and blockchain veterans The project is led by Sam Green, a former co-founder of Semiotic Labs and core contributor to The Graph , where he helped secure a $60 million grant and developed infrastructure used in over $80 billion of trading volume. Green’s academic background includes a PhD in reinforcement learning and a stint at a U.S. Department of Energy research lab. Crypto is quickly moving into the future with autonomous financial agents, and we intend to be the best source of financial intelligence for their high-consequence tasks,” said Green. First use cases and strategic partners Cambrian’s first use case is Deep42, an autonomous agent that delivers DeFi insights on X (@DeepFortyTwo), serving as a demo of the network’s capabilities.

The buzz around Initia , the innovative Layer-1 network, just got louder. If you’ve been diligently participating in their testnet, you’re in for a treat. Initia has officially dropped the details on their highly anticipated INIT token airdrop, and the numbers are looking incredibly generous, especially for those early supporters. Let’s dive into what you need to know about this rewarding cryptocurrency airdrop and how you can potentially claim your share of INIT tokens. What’s the Hype Around the Initia Airdrop and INIT Token? Initia is making waves in the blockchain space as a cutting-edge Layer-1 network designed for interconnected rollups, aiming to create a more unified and scalable Web3 experience. Their approach focuses on simplifying the deployment and management of rollups, making it easier for developers to build and launch decentralized applications. The INIT token is the native token of this network, and its airdrop is a way for Initia to reward early adopters and bootstrap its community. Why is this a big deal? Airdrops are essentially free tokens distributed to users, often for early engagement with a project. In the crypto world, they’re a fantastic way to get involved in promising projects without initial investment, and if the project takes off, these airdropped tokens can become quite valuable. Initia’s INIT token airdrop is particularly noteworthy because of the significant allocation to its community, especially testnet participants. Decoding the INIT Token Airdrop Rules: A Generous Allocation for Testnet Participants Initia has earmarked a total of 5% of the total INIT token supply – that’s a whopping 50 million INIT tokens – for this airdrop. Here’s the breakdown of how these tokens will be distributed, as revealed in their recent announcement on X: Massive Chunk for Testnet Participants: The lion’s share, a staggering 89.46% of the airdrop pool, is dedicated to those who actively participated in the Initia testnet. This highlights Initia’s commitment to rewarding its early and most engaged community members. Ecosystem Partners & Community Contributors: The remaining portion of the airdrop will be distributed to ecosystem partners and community contributors. This acknowledges the vital roles these groups play in the growth and success of the Initia network. Let’s put those numbers into perspective. With 89.46% of 50 million INIT tokens going to testnet participants, that’s approximately 44.73 million INIT tokens up for grabs for the dedicated early users! This is a substantial amount and signals a truly community-focused approach from Initia. Am I Eligible? Checking Your Cryptocurrency Airdrop Allocation Wondering if you’re among the lucky testnet participants eligible for the INIT token airdrop? Initia has made it easy to check! They’ve launched an official checker page where you can verify your allocation. Here’s how to proceed: Head to the Official Checker Page: Keep an eye on Initia’s official communication channels (like their X account and website) for the link to the checker page. Always ensure you are using the official link to avoid scams. Follow the Instructions: The checker page will likely require you to connect your wallet or enter your testnet participation details. Follow the instructions carefully to determine your eligibility and allocation. Important Claim Window: Once the Initia mainnet launches, eligible users will have a 30-day window to claim their INIT token airdrop. It’s crucial to mark your calendars and stay updated on the mainnet launch date to avoid missing out on your tokens. Details on the claiming process will be released closer to the mainnet launch. Why is Initia Prioritizing Testnet Participants in this Airdrop? Initia’s decision to allocate the vast majority of the cryptocurrency airdrop to testnet participants speaks volumes about their values. Here are a few key reasons behind this strategic move: Rewarding Early Engagement: Testnet participation requires time, effort, and often providing valuable feedback to the project. This airdrop is a direct way for Initia to acknowledge and reward this early commitment. Building a Strong Community: By prioritizing testnet participants, Initia is fostering a community of users who are genuinely invested in the project’s success. These are the users who are likely to be active participants and long-term supporters. Fair Distribution: Allocating a significant portion to those who actively contributed to the testnet promotes a sense of fairness and encourages genuine engagement rather than just opportunistic airdrop farming. What are the Potential Benefits of Participating in Cryptocurrency Airdrops like Initia’s? Beyond the obvious benefit of potentially receiving free tokens, participating in cryptocurrency airdrops like the INIT token airdrop can offer several advantages: Benefit Description Early Access to Promising Projects Airdrops often provide an entry point into new and innovative blockchain projects like Initia, allowing you to get involved early on. Potential Financial Upside If the project gains traction and the token value increases, the airdropped tokens can become a valuable asset.

Analysts suggest a rebound could push it toward $2.80, but failure may open the door to short setups and deeper pullbacks. In addition, massive whale sell-offs as of late raise the risk about a further correction. Can Bulls Regain Control? Ripple’s XRP witnessed a substantial resurgence on March 19 when the company’s CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, announced the end of the legal battle between his entity and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The price quickly soared to $2.60, but just as abruptly, it headed south in the following days in what seemed a “sell-the-news” moment . The pullback intensified in the past few days, and XRP neared the psychological level of $2 just hours ago. It currently trades at around $2.09 (per CoinMarketCap’s data), representing a 20% decline since the local peak observed at the time of Garlinghouse’s disclosure. Despite the negative performance, XRP remains a favorite topic for analysts, and many have touched upon the matter recently. The X user CRYPTOWZRD noted that Ripple’s cross-border token trades quite close to the $2 support area, predicting that a potential reversal from the current position may push the valuation toward the $2.80 resistance level. “Moving below $2.10 and holding there for a while can lead to a short. However, moving towards $2.33 and then a healthy reversal will offer a better short opportunity. Holding above $2.33 for a while may lead to a long. We now need to wait for the next healthy, mature trade setup to engage with the trade,” they specified. The analyst, using the X moniker The Great Matsby, gave their two cents, too. They assumed that XRP might have already bottomed at the beginning of February when the price briefly tanked under 1.80. Peter Brandt’s Opinion Veteran trader Peter Brandt also chipped in. Not long ago, he suggested that XRP’s price has formed a typical head-and-shoulders (H&S) pattern. He predicted bullish future if the valuation soars above $3 and a further pullback to as low as $1.07 if the resistance level of $1.90 doesn’t hold. Meanwhile, whales dumped 1.12 billion XRP in the span of 48 hours, potentially setting the stage for a deeper correction. After all, large sell-offs may trigger panic across the space, with smaller players also leaving the ecosystem. Such efforts also increase XRP’s circulating supply, which, combined with non-climbing demand, should lead to a price slump. The stash of 1.12 billion tokens equals almost $2.5 billion (calculated at current rates).

Traders had set targets for a $150 resistance breakthrough, but the Solana price was headed elsewhere. With the bearish pressure piling on Solana, Remittix is gaining even more attention from DeFi traders. The new project is a PayFi platform that is finally addressing one of the fundamental issues in cryptocurrency–withdrawing and liquidating crypto assets. Curious about Remittix? We have more on the new token here. Solana Price Last Week: Surge, Then Downward Spiral 2024 was quite the year for Solana, as its ecosystem became a hub for meme coins to launch. With all the utility provided by other DeFi features, the SOL ecosystem was one place to be. This year has been a tumultuous one for the Solana token so far, as SOL has corrected massively from its ATH. However, the Solana price picked up pace last week, especially in the light of news on the proposed Solana ETFs. The hype was only to be short-lived, though. Solana currently trades at $125.48, as its daily losses have culminated in a 3.74% weekly dip. With such losses on the SOL charts, even devout holders might be looking elsewhere for their profits. Two Reasons For The Solana Price Dip There are a number of reasons for the Solana decline, one of which comes from the meme developments last year. Meme coins have been traditionally sentimental, as most of them lack real utility or use cases. The lack of applications often leaves meme coins susceptible to price fluctuations and prolonged dips. And since memes were an integral aspect of the Solana success last year, the dip in meme coin activity will have telling effects on the entire blockchain. A second reason is that the network activity and DEX volumes are dipping at the moment, with most of the holders already on other projects for massive returns in 2025. As a result, experts have pointed out that the Solana price could reach $113 before a rebound is feasible. Remittix (RTX) is one of those other projects. The presale has been irresistible, for the most part, and there's talk of a 130x price rally on RTX tokens. Here's more. Remittix Is The Future Of Crypto Transfers The RTX coins are sporting the potential to join the top trending cryptos in the market, especially with their potential profits. But more than the gains, the platform is introducing a new portal for crypto withdrawals. Unlike the regular exchanges, the crypto assets on Remittix can be sent directly into fiat bank accounts, and not just the ones linked to the Remittix account. Users only need to provide details of the recipient bank account, pay gas fees, and approve the transfer of crypto assets; the platform handles the rest. Fun fact: Users can make transfers to almost all the popularly traded fiat currencies in the world. The platform already supports more than 30 of those currencies and about 40 cryptocurrencies, so the average crypto trader is not stranded for transfer options. With such reach, users all over the globe can send cryptos to their family, friends, and associates in other parts of the world without having to rely on remittance systems. Remittixtransfers are fast, safe, and without traces to the blockchain, and that's why the platform is going to be an instant hit. Get In On The Remittix Presale Here! The RTX coins are in presale now, with each going for $0.0734. That's quite the bargain, given their potential, and early presale buyers could get a huge chunk of the presale ROI. The much-anticipated rally is tipped to come as soon as the Remittix platform goes live. There's a lot of expected traffic, and with increased demand and use, the RTX coins will only keep rising in value. Get your own tokens today!

Wainwright & Co. analyst Mike Colonnese. Announced during Galaxy’s Q4 2024 earnings conference call, the deal involves converting 200 MW of Galaxy’s Helios mining facility in Texas to host 133 MW of AI infrastructure. The agreement is to produce $4.5 billion in revenue over the contract’s lifespan—roughly $300 million annually. That would be 70% of Galaxy’s 2024 revenue, with terms the analyst characterized as “very favorable,” yielding $2.26 million per MW in annual revenue at roughly 90% EBITDA margins. Helios Expansion Offers Billions in Future Value Even at estimated retrofit expenses of $1.46 billion to $1.73 billion, project debt will pay for most of them. CoreWeave will also cover electricity and operational expenses, reducing Galaxy’s long-term costs. Colonnese noted that Galaxy has 600 MW of unused capacity at Helios, which offers much space for growth. He estimates the data center segment potentially worth more than $3.5 billion one day—value not yet factored into Galaxy’s current stock price. Q4 Results Beat Expectations Galaxy released strong Q4 2024 numbers with $698.1 million of revenue—a 388% increase from Q3 and above consensus and analysts’ expectations. Net income was $174.3 million (52 cents per share) and also exceeded expectations. The quarter included a $560.6 million realized gain on digital assets and a $166.3 million special charge for a settlement with the New York Attorney General in relation to LUNA-related claims. Even as he lowered his target price to C$30 from C$35, Colonnese maintained a Buy rating, citing Galaxy’s positioning and huge potential upside in the AI infrastructure space.",Blockchain|Regulation,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MINING|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-03-31 16:16:00

This drop represents a 39% decrease in Ether’s value compared to Bitcoin over the course of 2025—a year that, until this point, many had thought would be a bull market for Ethereum. This is the first time in the 12 months following a Bitcoin reward halving that Ether has not managed to outperform Bitcoin. Historically, Bitcoin halving events have been associated with significant price increases for both assets, yet this time, Ethereum has lagged behind. The ETH/BTC ratio dropped to a five-year low of 0.02193. Ether has fallen 39% relative to bitcoin this year. It's the first time ETH has underperformed BTC in the 12 months after a bitcoin reward halving. The last time ether underperformed bitcoin to a similar degree was in the… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 31, 2025 Ethereum’s Struggles: A Five-Year Low The plunge in the ETH/BTC ratio is remarkable since it registers the lowest point in five years, a depth not reached since Q3 2019. At that time, the ratio had plummeted to 0.0164, with Ether undergoing a quarterly drop of 46% compared to Bitcoin. And while we have moved on from that period, this latest nosedive in the ratio clearly signals that the market favors Bitcoin over Ether, which now seems to be lagging. This year’s Ethereum underperformance is significant for a variety of reasons. Ether’s price has seemed principally directed, in terms of investor attention, toward Bitcoin. This happened in the wake of a halving event, when the reward for mining Bitcoin was reduced by half. Before we understood the potential of Ethereum, people thought of it as a digital asset, and its token was based on the types of things Bitcoin was capable of doing. Ether’s fall against Bitcoin underscores the latter’s growing dominance as the dominant cryptocurrency, especially following the recent halving. Over the years, Ethereum has asserted itself in folks’ minds as a close competitor to Bitcoin—but when you look at what happened to both these cryptos after both went through major halving events, it seems that Ethereum isn’t always on the same growth trajectory as Bitcoin. The decline in the ETH/BTC ratio signifies that more and more folks seem to be investing in Bitcoin instead of either Ethereum or its dark horse cousin. Bitcoin’s Inflows Continue Amidst Outflows from Short-Bitcoin Products Despite the fact that Ethereum is under pressure, Bitcoin still enjoys a steady stream of investment. Just last week, Bitcoin registered inflows of $195 million, which only emphasizes the fact that it’s still a highly desired and sought-after asset among investors. By comparison, short-bitcoin investment products have seen outflows for four weeks running, with the last week totaling $2.5 million. This juxtaposition reflects a much broader and developing shift in investor sentiment. More market participants than ever appear to be bullish on Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Bitcoin saw inflows totalling US$195m last week, while short-bitcoin investment products saw outflows for a 4th consecutive week totalling US$2.5m. Recent price falls have pushed bitcoin global ETP’s total assets under management to their lowest level since just after the US… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) March 31, 2025 The Bitcoin inflows are impressive and suggest that both retail and institutional investors have confidence in the asset. This is especially the case in light of the most recent halving event. The halving, which happened in April 2025, generally indicates a tighter supply and a potential future surge in the value of Bitcoin, making it an appealing investment right now. Its status as a store of value and a hedging mechanism against inflation remains robust, with such global conditions enabling and perhaps even enhancing its attractiveness. The reverse trend is developing, however, for short-bitcoin products, which have now experienced four consecutive weeks of outflows. This trend might indicate a growing faith in Bitcoin’s resilience and a move away from bets that hinge on Bitcoin’s decline. Investors who once sought to profit from what they thought was an inevitable decline in Bitcoin’s price might now be rethinking their strategies, especially as the cryptocurrency continues to show signs of a recovery after the recent halving. Bitcoin’s Assets Under Management Fall to Lowest Level Since U.S. Election Though a lot of money has come in, the total amount of capital now inside global ETPs (exchange-traded products) tied to Bitcoin has dropped. These days, Bitcoin has just $114 billion in total AUM (assets under management), which is the lowest that number has been since pretty much right after the elections in the U.S. The price of Bitcoin has, of course, fallen since then, and the price has definitely not been stable in the time since. With ETPs obviously linked to the price of the underlying asset, this lack of stability (and the total drop in price) has led to a drop in total AUM for Bitcoin globally. The drop in AUM for Bitcoin ETPs could also be due to investors being hesitant to commit a significant portion of their portfolios given the current regulatory uncertainty surrounding the crypto space. While the most recent inflows into Bitcoin ETPs show that there are still institutional investors out there willing to trust in the long-term safety and value of a Bitcoin-like instrument, the reduced AUM also signals that a fair number of investors seem to prefer a more cautious, wait-and-see approach. Despite the market’s volatility, Bitcoin largely remains the unchallenged number one in the cryptocurrency world. As a once-in-a-lifetime financial innovation, Bitcoin continues to be not only the largest digital asset but also the most recognized. For many, it remains the very foundation of the still-nascent cryptocurrency market. Yet Bitcoin’s assets under management, or AUM, have decreased, indicating that the level of investor interest in the digital financial tool is also decreasing. What Does This Mean for the Future of Ethereum and Bitcoin? Ether and Bitcoin perform differently, which leads to unavoidable questions about the future of both cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin stays on top, keeping the momentum it had when it was halved. In contrast, the Ethereum network underperforms (as does the Ether coin). When we look at the ETH-to-BTC trading ratio, we can see that it’s in decline, suggesting that Ethereums future is holding them back. When compared to what Bitcoin is doing at this present moment, the situation becomes even more glaring. Ethereum’s path forward may require novel innovations and strategies to keep it competitive in the crypto space. Its worth as the leading platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts is still quite solid. But Ethereum’s second act—to secure its place alongside Bitcoin as a truly dominant cryptocurrency—may require a payoff and a redefinition of its role that secures not just the fame of its founder, Vitalik Buterin, but also the future of the platform he invented. The future is still looking bright for Bitcoin, but the drop in AUM (assets under management) shows that not everyone is comfortable pouring more money into it. The investors who are still pouring money into it certainly seem to be taking it more in the way one might invest in gold, given the high fixed costs of mining Bitcoin, and the drop in issuance that is forecast to occur after the next halving. A huge question, though, is what will happen with inflation. If inflation rises significantly in the near future, and Bitcoin doesn’t go up much in price, it will be much less viable as an investable asset. Conclusion: A Market in Transition The fluctuating ETH/BTC ratio, moves in the opposite direction, and Bitcoin inflows continue to show just how complex and volatile the crypto market is. Nothing is certain, and the promise of Ethereum 2.0 is a big one. That said, should it take effect and realize its potential, Ethereum 2.0 will not restore Ethereum’s former glory and dominance overnight. Nothing less than the total overhaul of the system and a whole lot of time is going to get it there, if it gets there at all. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Since then, a lot has happened with the ADA Price movement. Market analysts are now weighing up the crypto project’s chances against other promising prospects like the new high-flying Panshibi ($SHIBI) as its presale continues to attract attention and sell out fast. As investors search for the best crypto to buy for huge gains this year, what does Cardano’s price prediction and recent price action since the reserve announcement suggest? Or is Panshibi the best crypto to buy for exponential growth this year? Latest Cardano News Reveal ADA’s Price Struggles Since Reserve Announcements, Investors Seek Better High-Growth Alternatives Cardano is going through a rough patch as trading volume falls amid the market downturn . While Cardano has enjoyed a strong position, coupled with its presence on the list of cryptos in the US strategic reserve, its recent dip emphasizes the risks of crypto projects. Many ADA investors now seek emerging projects like Panshibi, which presents a more straightforward growth path. According to market charts, Cardano's price has dropped nearly 25% in the past 30 days, forcing many token holders to consider alternatives with higher profit prospects. Thanks to Cardano’s loyal and supportive community, the crypto has held a strong position for a long time. However, due to Cardano’s slower upgrade process , the altcoin project lags behind top competitors like Solana. Experts believe this wait could negatively impact its long-term competitiveness. Cardano is currently going through a price correction that has lasted over a week. Hence, investors lean toward new projects that blend innovation with rapid expansion. This consideration is why tokens like Panshibi are top of their lists. Here's a crypto project whose presale is gaining traction as it bridges traditional and crypto markets, setting itself up to be the best crypto to buy in 2025. Panshibi’s Explosive Presale Momentum Sets It Up for UnrivaledROI Delivery Panshibi presents investors with a shot at massive returns and an opportunity to be part of something fresh and promising. Its presale has delivered consistent gains as the project sets up to deliver skyrocketing gains once it launches on major exchanges. This new crypto project combines an Asian theme with a love for pandas and their conservation, making it more than a regular memecoin project. Thanks to its distinctive approach, Panshibi consistently establishes itself as a top-trending token this year and the best crypto to buy. Beyond its memetic appeals, Panshibi adds real utility with Social-Fi and AI-driven opportunities for users to earn rewards. $SHIBI token holders can participate in community activities and stake their tokens for up to 1,200% APY. As holders, you also enjoy access to the exclusive Bamboo Private VIP Members Club. More value for early investors. Analysts have identified that Panshibi’s roadmap guarantees fair distribution throughout its presale. This presale has a $10 million cap and will run for 60 days. Time is running out as Stage 4 is selling out fast. Considering the token price grows with each completed phase, there's an opportunity for massive gains here. Early adopters are better positioned for significant ROI before prices surge further. Post-launch, analysts foresee a skyrocketing 145,000% price surge ahead. With security being a priority, Coinsuit has fully audited Panshibi’s smart contract. Such commitment to project security also means the token ownership will be renounced after the presale. Here's a setup to drive trust and move toward a potential 20,000% ROI for early investors. To participate in the Panshibi presale, check out their Telegram , Twitter , and Website .

42707768,https://nulltx.com/?p=147612,1743442024,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Smart Money Moves in the Memecoin Market: Significant Inflows and Outflows on March 30, 2025",https://nulltx.com/smart-money-moves-in-the-memecoin-market-significant-inflows-and-outflows-on-march-30-2025/,"The memecoin market welcomed a capital influx on March 30, 2025, as wise fund managers steered money within the nascent ecosystem. On-chain data outlined a picture in sharp contrast to previous weeks, showing that inflows into memecoin assets had handily beaten any other type of outflow. With funds flowing in, the day’s net volume into memecoins hit $1.26 million, against a $2.70 million volume that was traded in total. That trading volume may have been exaggerated by some involved trying to give their positions a plausible air of legitimacy, but it was nonetheless a hallmark of a day of activity and prominence for cryptocurrencies tied to internet memes. The current flurry of activity isn’t a fluke; it is based on real events. Some of these trading opportunities have arisen from the recent market resurgence. Others are simply a function of the kind of behavior that typically defines and drives the memecoin market. This is a sector of the crypto market where an increasing number of participants drive prices up, after which an increasing number of participants take over and drive prices down. This is all fueled by FOMO (fear of missing out) and the predictable crypto Twitter rallies. Memecoin Inflows Dominate the Day The substantial inflow that outpaced outflows by nearly three times was the most notable aspect of the March 30 activity. The total inflow for the day was reported at $1.98 million, compared to $721,000 in outflows. The positive net flow of $1.26 million indicates a level of confidence and interest from investors, demonstrating that even with the typical volatility of the memecoin market, investors still take the time to show their net positive support. A number of memecoins have seen big inflows lately, with $GOAT, $FARTCOIN, and $GRASS standing out as the biggest gainers. $GOAT, for example, had a big inflow of $236,000 this past week, and it looks like investors’ interest has been piqued. Meanwhile, $FARTCOIN saw an impressive inflow of $547,000. Both of these moves signal that investors are becoming increasingly apeshit over specific memecoins, wagering that some of them will moon in the not-too-distant future. Recap: Smart money on chain activities in the memecoin market for 30/03/25 Yesterday, there was more inflow than outflow Inflow: $1.98M Outflow: $721K Volume: $2.70M Net Volume: $1.26M There was inflow into: $VINE ($97K) $GRASS ($151K) $GOAT ($236K) #FARTCOIN ($547K) $WIF … pic.twitter.com/pfQ3MLWH25 — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 31, 2025 At the same time, $GRASS brought in an influx of $151,000, while $VINE drew in $97,000. These figures that I just recited are not very large relative to the rest of the market, and they are not very large on an absolute basis even if I just looked at them. %FILLER% But the fact that investors are putting even this much into these memecoins is a sign of something. These memecoins are also attracting more and more investment, which speaks to the diversification trend within the memecoin sector. $DOGE and $SHIB may still be the big dogs in terms of memecoin market cap, but there are now a whole bunch of memecoins with much smaller market caps that investors are looking at. If you don’t believe me, just take a look at the list of some of the memecoins with small market caps that people are supposedly investing in. Outflows Reflect Market Caution Although inflows predominated, there were also significant outflows from certain memecoins, denoting a shift in investor sentiment in specific market sectors. The largest outflow occurred with $TRUMP, from which $59,000 exited the asset’s market. Following that, $STONKS saw $46,000 flow out of its market, and $JTO had a $54,000 outflow that reduced its market cap. $GHIBLI also had an outflow of $30,000, and $ALCH was notched up with a $55,000 outflow. The outflows from these memecoins may imply a reevaluation of their market potential. Investors in these assets could be redirecting their attention to newer or more fecund tokens, like the ones receiving inflows on March 30. This trend underscores the fierce competition within the memecoin market, where the perception of potential can change in a heartbeat and where the newest projects always seem to have a shot at taking over for the ones that have lost their luster. It is important to note that outflows don’t necessarily indicate a long-term bearish sentiment toward these assets. Many memecoin investors tend to engage in short-term, speculative trading, moving their capital around rapidly in response to changing market conditions, news, or sentiment shifts. The outflows could simply represent temporary rebalancing or profit-taking by investors who want a more diversified portfolio. For them, that might mean shuffling memecoin capital out of memecoins and back into previously held assets, which could be anything from stocks to stablecoins. The Growing Popularity of Memecoins On March 30, the activity reflects a larger trend in the cryptocurrency market—the emergence of memecoins as a distinct asset class, drawing both retail and institutional attention. Once seen as the joke of the crypto space, memecoins have become legitimate trading vehicles for a wide array of market participants. Their high speculative appeal and viral nature make them short-term trading opportunities as well as investments driven by the kind of community hype that used to fuel the pump-and-dump schemes of yore. As memecoins gain popularity, they are more and more viewed as a gauge of market sentiment and a vehicle for traders to play the meme-driven trend. This makes sense. Memecoins are, by definition, thematic. They go up not because they have some fundamental underlying value but because people are buying them and, yes, trading them in and out at the right moment. And when we talk about right moments in trading, we’re often talking about timeframes that are all too susceptible to being influenced by the kinds of things that stir up online communities. Memecoins generate much interest and are also a good example of how social media and internet culture are apparently now central to the formation and growth of the cryptocurrency market. They are, in a way, a direct result of the psychology and sociology of the new virtual economies we are now part of. Platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord have become the epicenters of that virtual economy. Conclusion: A Volatile but Exciting Market The market for memecoins remained volatile and dynamic in March 2025. Inflows of $1.98 million were far larger than outflows of just $721,000, on the 30th of that month. That day, investors put significantly more money into memecoins than they withdrew, which implies that the more thoughtful, or “smart,” investors stomach the risks of the memecoin market and still see it as a place where they can make worthwhile token investments. Memecoins might be the last place you’d expect a thoughtful investment strategy, but such coins as $GOAT, $FARTCOIN, and $GRASS show that some folks are allocating a portion of their assets to that market. Nevertheless, specific memecoins are experiencing outflows that hint at some potential caution in the market. He’s too fond of us to let anything too awful happen. Investors are always reassessing. We’ve got both experienced traders and total newbies hitting up our space, searching for the next next big thing. The memecoin sector remains an exciting and totally wild part of the market. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

42707901,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=703145,1743442113,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42707901.jpeg,Musk’s DOGE gains access to highly sensitive info of federal employees,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/musks-doge-gains-access-highly-sensitive-info/,"Elon Musk’s D.O.G.E gained high-level access to a major federal payroll system over the weekend, giving it visibility into the personal and financial data of about 276,000 government workers. Two anonymous sources told The New York Times that the DOGE team obtained administrative access to the Federal Personnel and Payroll System (FPPS) on Saturday. This system is housed at the Interior Department and processes salary payments for employees in agencies such as the Justice Department, the Treasury Department, and the Department of Homeland Security. The system also covers the Air Force, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Senior IT officials at the Interior Department initially opposed DOGE’s request, arguing that the information, containing Social Security numbers and other sensitive details, is supposed to have stronger safeguards. The two anonymous sources said those objections about sensitive info were overridden, and at least two IT officials who resisted DOGE’s request were placed on administrative leave and are now under investigation. DOGE has pushed for access to federal databases in recent weeks. In some instances, these efforts have faced legal challenges. But Saturday’s development appears to be the most significant so far since it involves a system that processes tens of thousands of federal paychecks. A spokeswoman for the Interior Department, Kathryn Martin, said in a statement on Sunday, “We are working to execute the President’s directive to cut costs and make the government more efficient for the American people and have taken actions to implement President Trump’s Executive Orders.” Musk has been defending his actions Mr. Musk, speaking on Fox News last week, defended his team’s drive to access government personnel data. He said DOGE’s main goal was to reconcile separate databases in an effort to reduce waste and fraud. “These databases don’t talk to each other,” he said. “That’s really the biggest vulnerability for fraud. We need to reconcile the databases. It’s a, frankly, painful homework, but it has to be done, and will greatly improve the efficiency of the government systems.” Elon Musk and the DOGE team discussed their actions on Fox News. Source: Fox News At the Interior Department, the two individuals said DOGE staff members Stephanie Holmes and Katrine Trampe had been seeking elevated administrative access to the payroll system for about two weeks. That access would allow them to hire or fire employees, change salary levels, and adjust health benefits with limited or no further approval. Senior career employees at the Interior Department circulated a memo late last week outlining the risks. The memo noted that “no single DoI official presently has access to all HR, payroll and credentialing systems,” indicating the rare nature of DOGE’s request. It further warned that the Privacy Act imposes possible criminal penalties if sensitive personal information is viewed. Another concern is that granting extensive credentials to individuals who have not undergone specialized training could result in “significant failure” from operator error, as described in the memo. Despite these warnings, the two people said DOGE leaders pressed forward. Federal employees attempted to have Interior Secretary Doug Burgum review and sign the memo. The two sources mentioned that Burgum didn’t sign the memo. Instead, Tyler Hassan, who once served at DOGE and now works at the Interior Department, put the agency’s chief information officer and chief information security officer on administrative leave. The two employees are also under investigation for their supposed “workplace behavior.” With those officials sidelined, Ms. Holmes and Ms. Trampe were granted the administrative credentials they had been pursuing. By Saturday, DOGE had effectively gained visibility into and control over the employment status, compensation, and benefits of about 276,000 federal workers at dozens of agencies. These developments have caused anxiety among longtime government employees, particularly those worried about data privacy and potential political retaliation in the hiring and firing process.

Adding to the speculation, the analysis estimates a phenomenal 15,100% return on a $500 investment — inflating portfolios to $55,000. Whereas Solana rides a wave of institutional bullishness and Pepe reaps the benefits of meme-led price volatility, the presale momentum of Mutuum Finance is drawing comparisons to its early-stage counterpart, XRP, combining the benefits of DeFi industry utility and aggressive tokenomics. Solana (SOL): 96% Rally Prediction BlackRock has also been the cornerstone of Solana’s blockchain infrastructure as institutional interest continues to grow. According to on-chain analysis platform Santiment, social sentiment metrics show an all-time-high 18:1 bullish-to-bearish ratio, indicating traders’ bullishness towards SOL’s reversal. Shifting at $139, the token price has gained 7% in a week despite slight corrections. Analysts emphasize a significant demand zone, foreseeing a 96% jump to $270 should SOL break above $180. In what is adding fuel to the rally, Solana-based Ghiblification meme coin has within 24 hours exploded up 2,600% — reminiscent of January TRUMP-fuelled FOMO. With PumpFun Volumes doubling, SOL’s ecosystem is set for parabolic growth, using meme coin mania to onboard retail liquidity. Pepe (PEPE): Meme Mania Fuels Speculative Projections Pepe’s price trajectory is still linked to meme coin mania and has risen 11% this week to $0.000008. Analysts spot $0.000007 as a potential support floor, with resistance at around $0.000008. Some experts predict $0.00005 by October 2025 and $0.000011 in April according to short-term forecasts and a speculative 2025 model prediction from TradingView. Changelly predicts the $0.000035 target if the positive market sentiment persists. PEPE’s retail hype dependence makes it fragile despite a 106% monthly increase. Its value, rather, is dependent on social media virality and exchange listings — a double-edged sword in the mercurial world of crypto. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance is establishing itself in crypto lending by delivering compelling real-world utility while being backed up by structured tokenomics. Now in Phase 4 of its presale, $MUTM tokens are priced at $0.025, raising more than $5.8 million and acquiring over 7,500 holders. Investors buying in now have a solid 20% gain waiting for them, before Phase 5 takes it to $0.03. Tokenomics cement MUTM’s attraction: a $0.06 listing price ensures early birds a starting 140% profit upon launch. After the token is on its way, projections have revealed the upside and analysts expect the MUTM to rise to $1.50 by the year 2025, making it a 5,900% increase from where it sits today. This is a bright outlook due to MUTM buy-and-distribute model which drives platform revenue into token buybacks will keep demand high whilst rewarding stakers. Security is at the top, with Certik auditing Mutuum’s smart contracts, near completion. When completed, the audit results will be systematized through social channels to build investor confidence. Timing and Pricing for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Phase 4 is quickly nearing capacity as traders bet on the next price spike, similarly to how XRP’s 2017 ICO phase filled in the blink of an eye. As one of the 11 planned stages of the launch, participation now means the highest return on investment potential before the exchanges listing bring even greater the visibility. Mutuum lending infrastructure with mtTokens and overcollateralized loans threatens to make the protocol more of a DeFi staple than a meme that quickly fades. Grok 3 AI’s algorithmic prediction is consistent with trends in the market seen during XRP’s legendary run. While Solana and Pepe present high-risk opportunities for outsized gains, the presale strategy of Mutuum Finance — supported by audits, utility and buy pressure — provides a measured entry point into the next evolution of DeFi. And with the crypto market gearing up for a bull stage, time is running out for Phase 4 of MUTM. Once the project moves to the next stage, you could miss out on a 20% gain and far higher returns. Get your MUTM tokens now before Phase 5 sets off another price spike.

Here’s what could be in store for these assets. TA Patterns Are Pointing At Same Outcome For Four Altcoins In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has pointed out a commonality that may be present among XRP (XRP), Ethereum Classic (ETC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and yearn.finance (YFI). Related Reading: Bitcoin Weekly Preview: Tariffs, Whales, And Volatility Ahead The similarity lies in the signal that TA is giving on the price charts of each of these altcoins. Here are the graphs the analyst shared, showing the patterns: The first chart (top left) highlights the trend in the 1-day price of XRP, the fourth largest cryptocurrency by market cap. It would appear that the asset has possibly been forming what’s known as a head-and-shoulders pattern. This pattern forms when an asset’s price shows three peaks following a sharp surge, with the inner and outer peaks being similar in scale (the shoulders), and the middle one the largest (the head). The formation also involves one other feature: a support trendline that facilitates the formation of the different peaks. From the graph, it’s apparent that XRP is currently retesting this support line, after forming its third peak (the right shoulder). The head-and-shoulders generally signal a reversal of trend, so it’s possible that the coin may end up failing this retest and a sharp plunge would follow next. Bitcoin Cash, the bottom right chart, is also making a retest of what could be an important support line. In this case, the trendline is the lower one of a symmetrical triangle. The symmetrical triangle occurs when an asset finds itself consolidating between two trendlines that converge at a roughly equal and opposite slope. This means that as the price travels inside the channel, the distance between its tops and bottoms progressively becomes narrower. The upper channel provides resistance and the lower one provides support, but as the consolidation gets very narrow (that is, the price approaches the apex of the triangle), a breakout can become likely. Recently, Bitcoin Cash has come quite close to the triangle’s end, so it’s possible that an escape may be happening soon. As BCH is retesting the lower trendline right now, it’s possible that this break could happen towards the downside. Such a breakout, if one happens, could be a bearish signal for the coin, just like the one for XRP. Related Reading: Could XRP Actually Reach $10,000? Expert Weighs In The other two altcoins, Ethereum Classic (top right) and yearn.finance (bottom left), are both near the bottom line of a parallel channel. In this pattern, consolidation occurs between two parallel trendlines. It’s possible that support might end up holding for these coins, just like it has in the past, but given the fact that they have been trading inside the channel for a couple of years now and that a shift toward a bearish mood has taken place in the sector, a breakout to the downside may be coming. It now remains to be seen if XRP and the other altcoins will end up following in the trajectory that TA has been hinting at or not. XRP Price At the time of writing, XRP is trading around $2.06, down over 16% in the last seven days.

42707798,https://nulltx.com/?p=147613,1743442235,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,$ASKJ Struggles Amid ARC’s Decline: A Token Facing Uncertain Future,https://nulltx.com/askj-struggles-amid-arcs-decline-a-token-facing-uncertain-future/,"The cryptocurrency landscape knows its fair share of volatility, but some tokens experience a sharper kind of tumble—that is, they suffer a decline that is definitely steep and, in some cases, stunning. $ASKJ is one such token, which was founded by the same team that brought you $ARC. Once its pairing to $ARC ended, however, its price launched a free fall that has sent it down 95.64% since, with no apparent hope of resurrecting itself any time soon. Indeed, the price of $ARC has also dropped sharply—this time by a stunning 92.18%—so right now, the future of $ASKJ seems very much up in the air. A Rapid Decline: The Impact of ARC’s Struggles on $ASKJ $ASKJ’s decline can be largely attributed to its linkage with $ARC. When $ARC started to go down in price, $ASKJ went down with it, and it went down with a dramatic speed and dramatic looks. At one point, it looked like a fountain of money: you put in money, and almost magical, multiplied money came out. Now, it doesn’t look like that, and if you think about why it doesn’t look like that, you arrive at a point where you think about what $ASKJ is, and then you think about what altcoins and memecoins are. At present, $ASKJ’s market price is far low from its starting price; the opening price for $ASKJ was $125. The price is currently $22, reflecting a 82.4% drop. Since the continual declining of $ARC, the performance of $ASKJ is under a lot of pressure, and prices are dipping. Additionally, $ASKJ’s price is tied to the performance of $ARC in the market. In other words, $ASKJ is facing a lot of consistent selling pressure. Thus, $ASKJ is under both a lot of pressure and a downward spiral in the market. Wallet Insights and Buyer Sentiment: A Lack of Confidence Recent on-chain data from Stalkchain token insiders has given even more recent and greater insight into the current state of $ASKJ. The analysis has revealed something that is quite worrisome: the overwhelming majority of the top 90 wallets holding $ASKJ are currently in the red. This means that what was once an investment is now an unrealized loss for these holders, and there is no immediate sign of a recovery. The largest wallet has an unrealized profit-and-loss (PnL) of -$219.95K, and the current value of what is held has dwindled to just $7.54K. Overall, this situation does not inspire any confidence. The market is also notably short of new buyers. Daily inflows of small amounts do occur, but they are not substantially different from what was happening before and are not sufficient to get the price moving in a meaningful way. From this, we could infer that the sentiment is weak—not just in terms of the buyers we do have, but also in terms of the kinds of buyers that are entering or being seen in the market. Because most of the leading wallets are holding $ASKJ at a loss and no new investment is coming into the token, the price looks to be caught in a death spiral. The absence of buying interest puts more weight on the token and seems to make a recovery even less likely. What Does the Future Hold for $ASKJ? Given the existing conditions, the future of $ASKJ looks bleak. The absence of fresh buyers, combined with the already substantial losses seen by major holders, puts the token in a delicate spot. Barring some sort of miraculous upswing in market sentiment or a recovery in $ARC’s price, $ASKJ looks poised to keep heading down. 1. No Fresh Capital in a Weak State: As stated, the lack of new buyers and the reality that almost all big holders are in the red suggest that $ASKJ is in a pretty weak state. The absence of fresh capital to offset the selling pressure is a pretty big concern for the token’s ability to regain some life. 2. Continued Pressure to Sell: In the absence of flowing forces or clear evidence that positive sentiment is resurfacing for $ASKJ, the token is likely to endure continued pressure to sell. In fact, it could take only a small number of large orders to sell the token for $ASKJ to see another sharp drop in its apparent value. And if the current trend of selling $ASKJ continues, it could look forward to almost daily value losses; the current upturn in the crypto-universal market looks insufficient to provide the necessary buoyancy. But what happend to $ASKJ founded by $ARC Team AskJ is founded by the team of @arcdotfun and it is paired to $ARC but this token have dropped in price by -95.64% since launch. Since ASKJ is paired to ARC it means that its price is dependent on ARC’s performance which has also… pic.twitter.com/RXuZtBRVSS — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 31, 2025 Conclusion: A Token in Trouble $ASKJ serves as a reminder of the risks associated with tokens heavily dependent on the performance of a single asset. Initially, pairing with $ARC seemed like a good idea; however, with $ARC now in freefall, $ASKJ also looks like it’s sinking fast. $ASKJ struggles with a tepid reception from investors, relentless sell pressure, and a downright anemic appearance on the capital formation front. $ASKJ is in a pallid state.

Dogecoin, a meme coin once fueled by Elon Musk’s influence, has faced a decrease in volatility due to reduction in hype. Meanwhile, a new token, Panshibi (SHIBI) has sparked interest among investors. Analysts predict a staggering 22,000% surge for SHIBI, fueled by its ongoing presale success which has exceeded $1.28 million. Could this token outshine Dogecoin’s fading glow? Let’s find out How US Policies Are Impacting Dogecoin's Value At its current price of around $0.17 , the Dogecoin price is down 7.21% in the last one month .This price has been on a downtrend, and many experts point to U.S. policies as a major driver. In March 2025, new U.S. sanctions and trade tariffs under the Trump administration have rattled cryptocurrency markets. These policies, aimed at countries like China and Canada, have sparked uncertainty among investors. Dogecoin relies heavily on hype and market sentiment, so when economic fears rise, Dogecoin price dips. News outlets also report that tariffs on imports, set to hit in April, could even slow U.S. economic growth. This makes risky assets like cryptocurrencies less appealing to the public Beyond tariffs, the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to hold interest rates steady at 4.25%-4.5% has added pressure. High rates make borrowing costlier, leaving less cash for speculative investments like Dogecoin. Analysts say this cautious stance reflects worries about inflation tied to Trump’s policies. This could further affect the crypto market and by extension, Dogecoin price. Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has slashed federal spending, saving $115 billion by late March. While Musk’s influence once boosted Dogecoin, this influence has since waned. Now, these cuts signal a tighter US economy which dampens crypto enthusiasm. However, there is still some hope. Trump’s pro-crypto stance during his campaign has fueled talks of more involvement in cryptocurrency. Some experts are even saying there might be a Dogecoin ETF at the end of Q2, with betting odds at 41% on Polymarket . If approved, the ETF could skyrocket Dogecoin price by drawing institutional investors. For now, U.S. policies continue to weigh Dogecoin down while potential crypto-friendly moves offer a lifeline. Can Panshibi Really See a 22,000% Surge? In 2024, meme coins soared, with their market cap jumping over 500% to $115 billion by January 2025. With 2025 tipped as a golden year for altcoins, Panshibi’s bold promises are turning heads. Now, analysts are predicting a huge 22,000% surge for this panda-inspired token. Panshibi blends Asia’s theme, panda charm, and meme coin hype into one exciting project. Currently in stage 4 of its 15-stage presale, the token’s price sits at $0.005 and is set to hit $0.026 upon listing. This would signify a 1,200% jump during presale alone.Also, experts forecast a staggering 22,000% rise after it launches. Compare that to the Dogecoin price of $0.17. In addition, Panshibi offers lots of utilities. Its native token, $SHIBI, offers staking with up to 1,200% APY. Presale buyers will also get a bonus VIP access to the Bamboo Private Club. Since safety is key for Panshibi, its smart contract has been thoroughly audited by Coinsult and passed with flying colors. For liquidity safety, there will be a liquidity lock for 10 years which would set a foundation for an uptrend. With 1.2 billion tokens (60% of supply) available in the presale, everyone can get a share. At the end of the presale, unsold tokens will be burned and this scarcity could drive value sky-high. Conclusion As Dogecoin price wobbles under U.S. policy shifts, Panshibi’s upcoming listings on Uniswap and major exchanges continues to drive a bullish sentiment among investors. There is still time to join the presale train, investors are advised to get a share of the supply before the presale sells out.

42707953,https://nulltx.com/?p=147614,1743442405,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,$VINE Sees Bullish Sentiment Amid Rumors of Vine’s Relaunch by xAI,https://nulltx.com/vine-sees-bullish-sentiment-amid-rumors-of-vines-relaunch-by-xai/,"The market for memecoins is always full of surprises, but few developments have generated as much excitement as Elon Musk’s recent purchase of Vine, which now belongs to his company xAI. Since the Vine acquisition was announced, trading volume and price movement around $VINE, the token connected to the Vine platform, have picked up. There is, of course, a rumor going around that Vine might somehow be relaunched as an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven alternative to TikTok, and that development could have some wild memecoin implications. Since the news was announced, the price of $VINE has shown a significant bullish sentiment, with smart money actively accumulating the token. On March 30 alone, there was a net inflow of over $100K, so the market has clearly reacted positively to the idea of a Vine revival. What many investors and traders now seem to be wondering is whether this will kick off a more sustained trend upward or if it’s just a temporary blip before the market corrects itself. Vine’s Acquisition by xAI: A New Chapter in Social Media? Vine, the app for making short, very short, videos, was very popular. It was so popular that it was a video-sharing platform that, like Instagram, existed very much in the space alongside the then-ubiquitous Facebook and the not-very-missed MySpace. If you wanted to share a video with your friends, it was an option. It was also a thing that comedians did and a space in which performance was what it was about. Should Vine make a comeback in the form of an AI-enhanced platform, it could upend the current short-form video hierarchy, where TikTok rules. The thought of combining Elon Musk’s AI expertise with the preexisting brand of Vine has investors dreaming up new scenarios that lead to considerable capital inflows in $VINE. As with anything these days, from stocks to real estate, there is a search afoot for the next big thing in crypto. The prospect of a relaunch of Vine as a player—and not just any player, but a major one—in the social media field is an enticing proposition. Smart Money Flows Into $VINE: A Positive Signal for the Token Following the first announcement of the takeover, investor sentiment toward the $VINE token has gone through the roof. Inflows of the token have been steady ever since, and I think there might be a good reason for it. Despite the fact that the token had fallen back to about $50 from an all-time high of nearly $200 a few months ago, we had already been primed to expect some kind of crypto bull market coming soon. On March 30, net inflows into $VINE reached more than $100K, showing a clear vote of confidence for the token and the rumored Vine relaunch. What we’re seeing now, and even more so in the last few days, is a repositioning of sorts by investors, ahead of the relaunch and the tokenomics that will accompany it. The most favorable outcome for $VINE is if the smart money—obviously with strong confidence in the direction of the token—gains interest and even further inflates the token’s value during the relaunch. Is $Vine rebounding for Rumoured Vine launch in July? Elon Musk's company, xAI, acquired Vine, sparking discussions about its potential relaunch with AI integration to rival platforms like TikTok. Since the news, we have seen inflows from smart money into $vine Net flow peaked… pic.twitter.com/aqQZmuLHOl — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 31, 2025 Another remarkable deal took place on April 1, when a wallet received an inflow of $86.96K. This particular wallet now possesses 4.3 million $VINE tokens, which are currently worth about $177K. The inflow on April 1 was slightly less than what we saw on March 31, but the fact that we had another inflow on top of what was already a pretty full wallet indicates that $VINE seems to be very much in demand right now. That demand could be pinned on the ongoing rumors surrounding the potential relaunch of $VINE. With that in mind, the fact that capital is flowing into the $VINE token seems to be a pretty clear sign that anyone investing in the token is confident that its value is likely to increase sooner rather than later. Continued Interest Despite Market Volatility Sustained buying pressure surrounding $VINE is one of the most significant aspects of recent activity tied to the token. This is noteworthy because, in the current crypto market, we have seen a lot of volatility, where even the broader market can experience sudden swings. But throughout this tumultuous period, $VINE has continued to see positive net flows and, by extension, a lot of consistent and reliable buying. It is critical to remember, though, that the market is a fickle beast, and the present bullish sentiment could turn around just as easily as it came. In the end, $VINE is quite likely to follow the outcome of the Vine platform as a whole. If the relaunch is a flop or does not hook users, then I expect $VINE might just go back to doing exactly what it has done since a little before Thanksgiving. Nonetheless, the current trend indicates that investors are eager to wager on the chances of Vine making a vigorous return under the auspices of xAI. The prospect of an AI-revamped platform could give Vine a leg up on its rival platforms, affording it an unusual value differentiator in the overstuffed social media space. What’s Next for $VINE? The future of $VINE is directly linked to what happens next with the relaunch of Vine. Should xAI revitalize the platform and its brand by successfully integrating AI into the new Vine, then the potential for significant future gains in $VINE is real. Conversely, if this isn’t the outcome and the relaunch doesn’t meet the high expectations set for it, then we’re likely looking at a sharp correction for $VINE. Currently, we see that there is an overall positive sentiment in the market that could last for some time. This situation is also supported by the fact that smart money seems not to be done yet and is still accumulating the token. Whether this positive momentum will last as more details about the relaunch emerge remains uncertain, but the inflows we are seeing into $VINE suggest that some investors are definitely feeling positive about its prospects. To sum up, the factors driving the price movements of $VINE right now have to do with speculation not only about the relaunch of the Vine platform but also about its ownership under xAI. The current price bull run of $VINE may not just be a bear trap, though, as some might speculate. Even if the coming months see the price of $VINE beginning to truly rebound, the longevity of the relaunch and the Vine platform itself may mean those who invest in $VINE should watch for platform developments closely. If the platform doesn’t succeed, the $VINE price bull run doesn’t matter. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

While Solana showcases strength, Panshibi 'sinnovative features and impressive presale position it as a formidable player in the crypto market, offering investors a promising avenue for substantial returns and long-term engagement. Does Panshibi Have What It Takes To Dominate The Entire Crypto Market? Crypto investors are always on the lookout for game-changers, and Panshibi fits the bill. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on hype, this emerging memecoin is rewriting the playbook. As of January 2025, the meme coin market is valued around $115 billion, accounting for about 10% of the entire cryptocurrency market. Panshibi aims to capitalize on this growth with its entire ecosystem that offers real utility, AI-driven Social-Fi rewards, and a rapidly growing community. Investors aren't just getting in on a meme coin for fun; they’re participating in a dynamic ecosystem where users can earn rewards through challenges and community engagement. Additionally, Panshibi’s smart contract has been audited by Coinsult, verifying that it runs as expected without hidden risks. The liquidity pool is locked for 10 years, preventing sudden dumps that can ruin early investments. This setup keeps the market steady and protects long-term investors. The panda-themed project stands out because it taps into Asian markets, where panda symbolism carries cultural significance. Unlike dog-themed coins that feel overdone, Panshibi offers fresh branding that appeals to a global audience. Solana Shows Promise To Resume Bullish Momentum SOL has been on a strong run lately as revealed by the data on Solana price charts. According to this data, SOL is smashing through key resistance levels and picking up serious momentum. The surge comes as the general crypto market is witnessing a rebound and excitement around the SOL ecosystem is growing. A clear sign that investors are piling in on the SOL ecosystem is the fact that daily trading volumes have jumped by 85% to hit $2.56 billion. Additionally, on-chain data shows that the SOL network is expanding fast, with a record-breaking 11.09 million wallets now holding SOL. Technical analysis suggests that SOL has successfully surpassed the upper trendline at $132, signaling the potential for a major Solana price breakout. With this projected breakout, experts are adopting a bullish outlook, with some predicting that SOL could soar as high as $420 in the near future. Conclusion While SOL's growth is impressive, especially given the challenging state of the market, it pales in comparison to the remarkable surge that SHIBI has experienced during its presale. Currently in Stage 4 of a fifteen-stage presale, SHIBI has already raised over $1.28 million. The icing on the cake? You’ll receive a 20% limited-time bonus on every purchase, making this the perfect opportunity to enter at an attractive price of just $0.005.

Its performance—spectacular, to say the least—in the digital finance and cryptocurrency sectors over the years 2024 and 2025 has pushed it to center stage, and surely its investors are popping the champagne. Between January of 2024 and March of 2025, Pumpfun registered a truly unbelievable revenue number: 614 million dollars. From Jan 2024 to March 2025 Pumpfun have made a total reveune of $614M. SecondLane a crypto investment firm invested $15M for 1% stake in Pumpfun Pumfun is now valued at $1.5B pic.twitter.com/WGBbWUnPKu — Stalkchain (@StalkHQ) March 30, 2025 This growth has not gone unnoticed by backers. Of late, the investment firm SecondLane, a crypto-focused venture, has made a move that some are interpreting as evidence of not just ambition but also momentum for the company—investing $15 million to acquire a 1 percent stake in Pumpfun. The firm’s venture arm, which made its name and reputation through early investments in well-known projects like Filecoin, is increasingly backing what it calls “the next wave of the digital economy.” Pumpfun’s Soaring Daily Revenue and Growing Market Position Impressively, one of the best indicators of Pumpfun’s ascendance is what it’s pulling in on a daily basis: $2.11 million. That number places it about where you might expect a shocked cat to be: third in daily revenue in the sector, behind only some bulls who really need a bear to come around. So far, the names Pumpfun beats in the crypto space when it comes to daily revenue are probably the most well-known, including Hyperliquid, Ethereum, and Solana. Pumpfun daily revenue is now the 3rd highest at $2.11M. above Hyperliquid, Ethereum, Solana. pic.twitter.com/emTXDZBdE3 — Kakashi (@kkashi_yt) March 30, 2025 This sudden upsurge in revenue demonstrates Pumpfun’s capability to cater to the burgeoning need for its offerings while providing competitive, innovative solutions in today’s rapidly evolving marketplace. With user and investor attention clearly focused on the platform, the company has continued to expand its market presence, offering even greater visibility for prospective, future revenue streams. The business model and approach to digital service that Pumpfun has chosen to implement have obviously worked quite well, winning over not only individual customers but also plenty of institutional investors. From its beginning, Pumpfun has been building its reputation in the highly competitive cryptocurrency and digital finance world. The latest revenue numbers show us two things: Pumpfun is performing strongly, and its strategy is effective. To keep moving in such a competitive space and pull ever greater amounts of market share and revenue speaks volumes and shouts as clear as a bell about the kind of business Pumpfun is. Strategic Investment and Future Prospects The recent strategic partnership with SecondLane has only strengthened Pumpfun’s already solid position. With SecondLane putting in $15 million for a 1% stake, it is clear that the investment firm sees great potential in Pumpfun’s future. This deal is a powerful statement of the confidence that venture capitalists and crypto investors have in the company. It says that Pumpfun is not just a short-term success but a long-term growth prospect. Pumpfun is on track to grow and move deeper into the cryptocurrency space. The world of cryptocurrencies continues to grow and evolve. Pumpfun is strategically positioned to capitalize on developments in this market. With innovative services and a commitment to excellence, the company is primed to play an even larger role in the space of digital currencies. Not only are strategic investments propelling Pumpfun upward, but also Pumpfun’s rejuvenated presence in the marketplace. Its $2.11 million in revenues—earned every day of the week—leapfrog it over well-known adversaries in the digital economy. (Where are you at, Hyperliquid? Ethereum? Solana?) Despite its relative nascency, Pumpfun now rates as a robust and timely player in the elements of the digital economy. The Future of Pumpfun: Growth and Innovation Ahead The future holds a gleaming prospect for Pumpfun. The company, with its present daily revenue level, seems set to navigate well through the digital world, which is always in flux. With the digital world shifting ever more toward not just payment solutions but assets like cryptocurrencies, the news that Pumpfun has an adaptable business model and allots some of its R&D to pure, basic funded research inside the Payment Solutions Div. bodes well for the company. The firm’s capacity to produce such remarkable daily proceeds is a tribute to its well-established base and avant-garde planning. With the continuing upward trend in demand for services pertaining to cryptocurrency, Pumpfun is strategically positioned to reap the rewards of this swell and enhance its standing in the digital finance arena. To sum up, the path of growth for Pumpfun, its remarkable financial achievements, and its latest infusion of capital from investors place it squarely on the path to success in the online and cryptocurrency portfolios. Pumpfun has a $1.5 billion valuation, but even at that, it would seem to be positioning itself as much more than a niche player in digital currency. Call Pumpfun’s innovations and expansion amazing, and you would be right. As far as the world of cryptocurrency is concerned, Pumpfun isn’t either a failure or a flameout. On the contrary, Pumpfun is becoming a continent-sized presence in what is truly an online world by embracing both innovation and expansion. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Seasoned investors know that downturns can be the perfect time to pick up valuable assets at a discount. This article delves into promising cryptocurrencies poised for a rebound, offering insights for those looking to make wise investments during turbulent times. Injective Price Levels and Market Sentiment Overview The past INJ month saw a steep decline of nearly 37%, while the six-month drop approached 60%. Price action has shown significant downward momentum and heightened selling pressure. Recent performance reflects a period of persistent weakness and volatility, pointing to a bearish run that has resulted in drastic reductions in market value. Current trading levels place Injective in a range of approximately $10 to $18 dollars. The nearest support lies around $6, while resistance is observed near $24, with a second resistance at $33. Momentum indicators are leaning negative, and a brief one-week drop of about 16% indicates that bears remain in control. Traders may consider buying near the support level and look to take profit at or below the resistance levels during this uncertain, range-bound phase. Aave Price Analysis: Recent Performance and Current Price Action Last month AAVE saw a drop of about 20%, reflecting increased volatility amid bearish pressure. In the past six months, Aave managed a modest rebound with approximately a 5% gain, showing mixed momentum. Weekly setbacks of nearly 18% further highlight short-term challenges while hinting at lingering optimism over the longer term. Current prices range between $136 and $290, with immediate resistance around $389 and a second hurdle near $544. Support is near 80. Bearish signals, including a low RSI below 35, show pressure from sellers. Traders may seek buying opportunities near support or consider short-term positions if the price fails to break through resistance. VeChain Price Correction Amid Bearish Signals Last month VeChain showed a sharp decline with prices dropping about 21%, while over the last six months the fall was more moderate at around 2.35%. The data reflects a corrective phase after reaching a broader trading range, with noticeable downward pressure developing during this period. Current prices are trading between $0.019 and $0.043. The nearest resistance is at $0.058, and immediate support appears at $0.010. With a second resistance at $0.082 and a flat lower bound, the market lacks a clear upward trend. Bears hold control with negative momentum and an RSI just below 35, hinting at potential entry points for bulls within the identified levels. Conclusion Investing during market downturns can be strategic. INJ , AAVE , and VET present solid options. These coins have strong potential for recovery. They offer promising opportunities for those looking to capitalize on lower prices. Investing wisely during declines can yield significant returns once the market rebounds.

Bitcoin enters April under bearish pressure as Paul Atkins Faces Congress Scrutiny Bitcoin (BTC) is set to enter April 2025 with a mild 2% haircut for March despite positive price action in recent weeks. Notably, BTC price had surged to $88,500 on March 25 before facing renewed bearish pressure as political uncertainty weighed on the market. Former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins ’ congressional scrutiny sparked concerns that Trump’s pro-crypto policies could encounter resistance in the weeks ahead, which dampening investor in the last week of March. Bitcoin Price Action, March 31 2025 | Source: Coingecko Adding to the selling pressure, Trump’s newly proposed tariffs heightened macroeconomic concerns, driving risk-off sentiment across financial markets. BTC is trading at $83,400 at press time on March 31, down 1% from the $84,400 opening price on March 1, as traders reassess their portfolio for Q2 2025. BlackRock CEO Warns Bitcoin Could Rival U.S. Dollar as Reserve Currency if Debts surge from $478B to $952B BlackRock CEO Larry Fink cautioned that the U.S. dollar’s dominance as the global reserve currency is at risk due to rising national debt and fiscal deficits. US Interest Expense and Average Interest Rates on the National Debt, as of March 2025 | Source: Fiscaldata.Treasury.gov At press time on March 31, the US Treasury has paid out $478 billion in interest expects since the start of 2025, according to the official data. Larry Fink has expressed concerns that this figure could nearly double before the end of the year. In his annual letter to shareholders , the 72-year old Blackrock CEO warned that unchecked government spending could push investors toward Bitcoin as a safer alternative. “The dollar’s position as the global reserve currency is not guaranteed… interest payments on government debt will exceed $952 billion this year, surpassing defense spending for the first time.” – Larry Fink, March 2025. Fink also acknowledged Bitcoin’s growing role in global finance, highlighting BlackRock’s spot Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, which has amassed over $50 billion in assets within the first 15-months of trading after the landmark SEC approval back in January 2024. BTC Price Forecast: Can Bitcoin Reclaim $100K in April 2025? Bitcoin price forecast signals are leaning neutral this week, having peaked at $88,500 on March 25 before the current bearish trend set after Trump hinted at deploying more tariffs. Market sentiment tilted further negative as former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins faced congressional scrutiny, raising concerns that Trump’s pro-crypto stance could face resistance. As controversy surrounding Paul Atkin’s confirmation further intensified bearish headwinds from Trump’s proposed tariffs headwinds, Bitcoin is now set to close a second consecutive month in red, after having posted an 18% dip in February. Bitcoin Price Forecast For April 2025 | TradingView As seen in the TradingView chart above, Bitcoin price has retreated to $83,381, as selling pressure emerged near the $90,000 resistance zone. More so, the Keltner Channel midline at $67,019 provides key support, but a failure to hold above this level could trigger deeper corrections. Parabolic SAR dots at $109,600 highlight long-term bullish target. But typically the SAR pointing above current prices emphasises short-term bearish dominance, suggesting that BTC is likely to begin April 2025 on a negative note.

The bill is an amendment to existing state income tax laws, and the exact language in the proposed legislation is as follows: “Any sale of [b]itcoin by an individual or business in Rhode Island shall be exempt from state taxation if the total value of sales is less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per diem. The limit of the state tax exempt [b]itcoin transaction shall not exceed ten (10) sales per a thirty (30) day cycle.” And the bill defines a “sale of [b]itcoin” as “any transaction in which [b]itcoin is sold or exchanged for another form of value, such as fiat currency or other physical or digital assets.” The bill also clarifies that this exemption only applies at the state level and that it doesn’t affect federal tax obligations. Under the bill, individuals and businesses who engage with these types of tax-exempt bitcoin transactions are responsible for keeping records of these transactions, including the total value of sales per day, and should be prepared to provide these records to the Rhode Island’s department of revenue for audit or compliance purposes. In a slide deck prepared by the Rhode Island Blockchain Council that was shared with Bitcoin Magazine, Chris Perrotta, Chairman of the Council, wrote that the passing of Bill S. 0451 would help to reduce friction for digital asset payments. He stated that “current tax implications of spending BTC hamper its utility for Rhode Island citizens and stifle economic activity.” Perrotta also noted that the passing of this bill would stimulate blockchain-based economic activity in the state, making Rhode Island one of the states at the forefront of this technology. What is more, he also proposed that small businesses accept bitcoin for products and services as a means to stimulate economic growth. Thus far, no other U.S. states have introduced comparable bills. At the federal level, the only bill that has proposed something similar is the Lummis-Gillibrand “Responsible Financial Innovation Act” , which provides a de minimus tax exemption on bitcoin transactions valued up to $200.

The first advisory rescinded on Friday was Staff Advisory No. 18-14, Advisory with Respect to Virtual Currency Derivative Product Listings. Originally published in May 2018, the advisory established guidelines for crypto-related derivatives, including requiring reporting firms to maintain “close coordination with [the] CFTC surveillance group” and establishing a large trader reporting threshold of five bitcoins (or the equivalent value for other cryptocurrencies), among other suggestions. On Friday, the CFTC published a letter saying that “additional staff experience” and “increasing market growth” had rendered the guidance unnecessary. The second advisory, Staff Advisory No. 23-07, Review of Risks Associated with Expansion of DCO Clearing of Digital Assets, from May 2023, “emphasize[d] compliance” with CFTC regulations due to the “hieghtened cyber and other operational risks that may be associated with digital assets.” This guidance was withdrawn for another reason — to clearly treat crypto-related derivatives and their issuers fairly, the CFTC suggested. In a separate letter on Friday, the CFTC said it was rescinding Staff Advisory No. 23-07 “to ensure that it does not suggest that its regulatory treatment of digital asset derivatives will vary from its treatment of other products.” The CFTC’s sister regulatory agency, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has overhauled its approach to crypto regulation since President Donald Trump took office in January. Under the new leadership of Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, the SEC has created a Crypto Task Force that has spearheaded its transformation, engaging with the industry and backing down from a host of lawsuits and investigations into crypto companies that began under the leadership of former Chair Gary Gensler. Though the SEC’s rapid transformation may be flashier, the CFTC is currently undergoing a transformation of its own, streamlining its regulatory strategy as part of Acting Chair Caroline Pham’s plan for the agency “get back to the basics.” In addition to the two pieces of dropped crypto-related guidance, the agency has rescinded other non-crypto-related staff advisories and overhauled its enforcement division, slashing a multitude of specialized enforcement teams down to just two, pledging that a simplified enforcement division would be more efficient and “stop regulation by enforcement.” Liz Davis, a Washington, D.C.-based partner at Davis Wright Tremaine LLP and a former chief trial attorney in the CFTC’s Division of Enforcement, told CoinDesk she sees the two pieces of rescinded crypto guidance as in line with Pham’s “back to basics” approach to running the agency. But Davis also suggested that the changes could be tied to a larger restructuring going on at the CFTC. “They’re probably undergoing a reorganization with everything that's going on with [the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)],” Davis said, adding that Pham’s ongoing efforts to “centralize” the CFTC’s operations could help facilitate a reorganization.",Policy|Caroline D.

To read full editions, subscribe . Gunzilla Games’ GUN token — for its Off The Grid game and Avalanche subnet Gunz — is now live. GUN climbed up 12% since its launch early Monday morning, but has since fallen slightly. As of 11:30 am ET Monday, its price was $0.09. The token had a market cap of roughly $60 million at that time, with 604 million GUN in circulation out of a possible 10 billion. GUN already has a trading volume of $126 million just a few hours after launch, per CoinGecko data. The Gunz chain has already seen over 487 million transactions across 14.5 million wallets, according to Avascan data and Gunzilla’s Director of Web3 Theodore Agranat. “Unlike most Web3 projects, we’ve spent five years now building everything first and testing it in testnet for over a year,” Agranat said in an interview with Blockworks, noting that the team chose to launch the token on Binance because it’s the biggest crypto exchange. Agranat says he’s seen crypto exchanges engaging with gaming projects less over the past year — but says those projects that did launch have largely missed the mark. Off The Grid is free to play on PC and console — and doesn’t require a wallet or any crypto. The game is largely a skill-based shooter, though some characters’ “cyberlimbs” grant special abilities. Items can also be bought and used in the game. Those wishing to pour money into the game can pay for Off The Grid’s Pro membership ($12 a month) to use the game’s marketplace, which uses blockchain on the backend. But even if you’re playing for free, you’ll slowly earn GUN as you go. If you’ve already been playing the game, though, those GUN token numbers you’re seeing won’t be turned into actual GUN tokens, Gunzilla has confirmed. “Their main benefits are the rare items that they earned or received with OTG Pro — many of which no one will ever be able to access in the future,” Agranat explained on the benefits for early players in a message. “Hexes” and other items earned early on will transfer over, though. And though it’s challenging, extracting hexes while playing the game will get you more loot (each hex can be decoded to reveal an item). Agranat noted during our interview that over 380,000 hexes had been extracted in just one day last week. I’ve sunk some hours into the game so far, and I like both solo mode and trios mode. This game is fast — more like Call of Duty: Warzone than Apex Legends in terms of time-to-kill and overall speed. But even without its crypto elements, Off The Grid brings something unique to the extraction battle royale shooter genre with its cyberlimbs and gritty, futuristic aesthetic. A little scoop: Tomorrow, on April 1, expect a “very, very fun new skin activation,” Agranat shared. There’ll be a new skin coming out — could it be April Fool’s-themed? Bigger picture, Off The Grid is just the beginning for Gunzilla. “It is just the first of many games that we will launch in our ecosystem,” Agranat said. Get the news in your inbox.

42708246,https://nulltx.com/?p=147616,1743442810,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Aptos Blockchain Sees Remarkable Growth and Development in March – Week 4 Recap,https://nulltx.com/aptos-blockchain-sees-remarkable-growth-and-development-in-march-week-4-recap/,"As March ends, the Aptos blockchain holds the fascination of the technology and cryptocurrency worlds—thanks to a series of recent impressive achievements, partnerships, and developments. By expanding its ecosystem through collaborations and proving its technological superiority, Aptos has established itself as a leading player in the blockchain space. A real highlight of the week was the announcement of the test at Aptos and Xangle Official for the new collaborative Ideathon contest. The contest has some meaty incentives, with participants eligible to earn up to $10,000 in prizes. The future is the prize, as Aptos aims to push the adoption and development of its blockchain network through this Ideathon. On top of that, Aptos achieved a substantial mark with the declaration of its rank as the quickest blockchain now in service. Aptos today has a median block time of only 0.13 seconds, which is nothing short of astonishing and makes it not only one of the very top blockchain networks in terms of speed but also really underscores its efficiency and potential for scalability. That is a key factor as the blockchain industry continues to burgeon, and seeing as how scalability has been a major issue that some other networks have failed to overcome. Aptos in the Spotlight: Key Discussions and New Partnerships The week also saw a significant industry conversation when Representative Bryan Steil, together with Aptos Labs CEO Avery Ching, participated in a key talk at Chamber Digital’s Blockchain Conference. The duo held forth on decentralized finance (DeFi) and the freshly unveiled STABLE Act, which sets about creating an actual regulatory framework for not just stablecoins but also other digital assets. As regulators across the globe continue to wonder about the future of digital currencies, Aptos Labs’ involvement in these conversations ensures that the network isn’t just a bit player but rather an essential part of the next chapter in blockchain history.

The preeminent digital asset custody provider has broadened its horizons by embracing the Aptos Digital Asset Standard. This partnership now means that Aptos users can secure their on-chain digital assets using the world-class storage service that BitGo provides. That’s a big deal. If you are going to invest in a network and use it for anything, you need to trust that the actual assets you are minting, sending, or using in any way are trustworthy, as well. Expanding the Ecosystem: Reports and Insights on the Move Programming Language This week, Aptos was not only expanding its ecosystem but was also in the news itself. Messari, the cryptocurrency research and analytics firm, released an in-depth report on Amnis Finance, a platform in the Aptos ecosystem. Amnis Finance, which is characterized by Messari as the “amniotic fluid” for decentralized finance (DeFi), has what seems almost a probable cause to be a candidate for broad adoption in the coming years. Here is why. A key development arose from the insights shared by Alex Nguyen, the CEO of VibrantX Finance, who talked about the origins and evolution of the Move programming language. Move was specifically designed for the Aptos blockchain, enabling safe and efficient smart contracts that fulfill the needs of the Aptos ecosystem. Nguyen’s talk shone a light on the thought process that went into the creation of Move and how its unique design makes it well-suited for the ecosystem it serves. Thanks to the scalability and security features that Move possesses, the language has already gained traction, and those features largely guarantee that applications written using Move will operate in a decentralized environment. Aptos Reaches 70 Million Wallets – A Sign of Growing Adoption One of the most important milestones for Aptos this week was reaching 70 million wallets on the network. This mirrors and magnifies the interest and adoption of the Aptos blockchain by users of all kinds, everywhere. Seventy million wallets is also a powerful indication of both the network’s scalability and its burgeoning user base. The more individuals and businesses that integrate with Aptos, the more it seems like a network that really is rapidly growing and will continue to do so in the months to come. As people continue to adopt wallets at this steady rate, Aptos is bound to see an uptick in interest from an even broader swath of developers, investors, and users. A growing number of individuals exploring our ecosystem means a far greater likelihood of them stumbling across its latent potential. And without a shadow of a doubt, that spectrum of interest includes the Aptos network itself. Looking Ahead: The Future of Aptos Blockchain The fourth week of March was an eventful one for Aptos, with the blockchain demonstrating not just its technological prowess but also its growing heft in the broader blockchain ecosystem. Discussions with regulators about the nascent crypto space were hosted by the Aptos team. Meanwhile, the project notched some impressive adoption milestones, including a foray into the emerging world of decentralized finance. If that didn’t make for a significant week in Aptos’s evolution, the project also formed some new partnerships that could be pivotal in its pathway to becoming a top-three L1 within two years. And the icing on the cake? The project was awarded a coveted spot on the grant list for the Gitcoin Round #17 fundraising effort. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Specifically, a number of Ethereum (ETH) whales—wallets holding large quantities of ETH—have begun turning their focus toward a lesser-known but steadily growing DeFi project: Mutuum Finance (MUTM). What’s drawing them in isn’t just the low entry price, but the clear utility, forward-thinking design, and long-term earning potential that stands out in a sea of short-lived plays. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance isn’t just another token launch. It’s being positioned as a foundational tool in the next generation of decentralized finance. Built on a non-custodial model, the platform enables users to lend, borrow, and generate yield—all while keeping full control over their crypto assets. Every transaction flows through audited smart contracts, removing the need for intermediaries and creating a system that’s both efficient and transparent. For ETH whales who’ve already experienced growth through price appreciation alone, the interest in MUTM is more strategic. It’s not just about catching a big pump; it’s about entering early into a protocol that offers functionality and real income opportunities. At its core, Mutuum allows users to supply assets and earn interest, or borrow capital by locking in crypto holdings as collateral—without the need to sell. This approach provides flexibility for managing assets in both bullish and bearish market conditions. Another major element gaining attention is Mutuum’s plan to introduce its own overcollateralized stablecoin. Unlike centralized alternatives, this stablecoin will be minted directly from assets already deposited within the platform. The benefit? It creates an internal, decentralized loop that strengthens the protocol’s ecosystem while offering a more secure and transparent alternative to existing stablecoins. The stablecoin will be backed by actual on-chain assets and governed through automated smart contracts that adjust supply as borrowing demand rises or falls. Adding to this framework is Mutuum’s mtToken system—a feature that directly rewards liquidity providers. When users deposit crypto into the protocol, they receive mtTokens in return. These tokens track both the principal deposit and the interest it accrues over time. Not only do mtTokens represent the user’s share of the pool, but they also enable passive income, all while remaining compatible with other DeFi protocols and secondary markets. This utility is further enhanced by Mutuum’s buy-and-redistribute mechanism: platform revenue is used to purchase MUTM tokens from the open market and distribute them to users who commit their mtTokens to designated staking pools. For ETH whales and experienced investors, this built-in buy pressure is a sign of sustainable tokenomics, not just speculative hype. Security and transparency are also being taken seriously by the team. A full smart contract audit by CertiK is already in progress, with plans to announce completion around the time of launch. This assurance of code integrity adds another layer of credibility to the protocol, especially for larger capital holders who need assurance before entering a new ecosystem. What makes all of this more appealing is the timing. MUTM is still in its presale phase, currently priced at just $0.025. That price point alone is attractive for early positioning, but it’s the growing adoption, platform development, and clear utility that’s prompting whales to allocate. Many view it as not just a short-term opportunity, but an investment in a system that will play a critical role in how people borrow, lend, and manage assets across DeFi in the coming years. Mutuum Finance is not competing for attention with buzzwords or marketing gimmicks. It’s quietly building a system that prioritizes real-world use cases, long-term incentives, and security. For those watching the smart money, the trend is clear: when ETH whales start moving toward a project, it’s usually not without reason. And with its fundamentals, roadmap, and utility, MUTM is increasingly being seen as the next big thing in decentralized finance.

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) has launched a specialized task force to address potential compliance issues in the growing sector. AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas started the internal task force in December. He brought together experts from the agency’s regulatory, enforcement, and intelligence divisions. The group is targeting money laundering and terrorism financing risks associated with crypto ATMs. “The task force has been busy engaging with businesses to understand the risks in their sector and assess their compliance with the law,” Thomas said in a statement. Australia’s growing crypto ATM sector Australia has been at the forefront of cryptocurrency ATM rollouts in the Asia Pacific region. The nation has experienced a massive expansion in the sector, with the number of machines increasing from only 23 in 2019 to 60 in 2022. Presently, there are about 1,600 crypto ATMs in operation in Australia. Statistics from Coin ATM Radar indicate a general spread of these machines across prominent cities in Australia. Sydney takes the lead with 451 crypto ATMs, Brisbane comes in second with 267, and Melbourne follows with 200. There are other concentrations of Perth with 157 ATMs and Adelaide with 97. These machines are found in regional areas as well, but with fewer in cities such as Cairns (16), Townsville (13), and Hobart (12). Source: Crypto ATM Radar The overwhelming majority of transactions made using these ATMs are cash deposits to buy Bitcoin. This cash-to-crypto pipeline has raised specific concerns for regulators because it is hard to track the source of physical currency once it’s in the cryptocurrency system. “We want to ensure crypto ATM providers have robust practices to minimize the risk that their machines can be used to launder dirty money or to scam and defraud innocent people,” Thomas explained. The whole network of cryptocurrencies in Australia is more than just ATMs. According to the statistics, 37,996 crypto ATMs are present worldwide, and Australia has approximately 4.2% of the total. Apart from ATMs, the country has 235,495 other cryptocurrency services on various platforms. This huge network is run by 356 operators and 40 producers across 69 countries. AUSTRAC states various crypto ATM issues AUSTRAC’s cryptocurrency task force has identified several areas of concern in the activity of crypto ATMs throughout Australia. Their investigation has uncovered what the agency calls “worrying trends and indicators of suspicious activity.” They are particularly looking for transactions that involve scams and fraud. The regulator is most concerned with making sure that crypto ATM operators perform efficient anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) screening. Early findings by the task force suggest that some operators may not have adequate controls in place to prevent their machines from being used for criminal activity. The cash-based nature of crypto ATM transactions poses difficulties for regulation. In contrast to normal bank transfers or credit card payments, injections of cash into crypto ATMs are occasionally harder to track and verify. Thomas reiterated the agency’s pledge to deal with these problems on a dual foundation of industry cooperation and enforcement. “We will continue to work with industry to raise standards, but we will also take action against operators who don’t comply,” Thomas said.

Assembly Bill 1052, originally introduced on February 20, 2025 as the Money Transfers Act, was significantly amended on March 28 by Banking and Finance Committee Chairman Avelino Valencia. The document now includes a number of provisions protecting the rights of investors in bitcoin and other cryptoassets. The amendments completely change the name of the bill - instead of ”Money Transfers Act,” it is now called ”Digital Assets.” ”California often sets a nationwide legislative vector, and if the Bitcoin Rights Act passes here, it could pass anywhere,” Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter said on March 30. ”Once passed, this law will guarantee nearly 40 million Californians the right to self-store digital assets without fear of discrimination,” he emphasized. Expanding the legal framework The bill also recognizes the use of digital financial assets as a valid and legitimate form of payment in private transactions and prohibits government agencies from imposing restrictions or taxes on digital assets based solely on their use as a means of payment. The document also expands on the California Political Reform Act of 1974 by prohibiting public officials from issuing, sponsoring or promoting digital assets, securities or commodities. ”A public official shall not engage in any transaction or activity involving digital assets that creates a conflict of interest with his or her public duties,” reads a section of AB 1052. The bill is now officially introduced and awaiting first reading. According to BTC Maps, there are now 99 merchants in California that accept bitcoin payments. Among the largest cryptocurrency companies based in California are Ripple Labs, Solana Labs and Kraken. On February 2, 2025, California also introduced the Stablecoin Bill on February 2, 2025, which seeks to clarify the requirements for stackcoin collateral, liquidation processes, redemption and settlement mechanisms, and security audits. Bitcoin is in the spotlight with U.S. lawmakers According to Bitcoin Law , 95 bitcoin-related bills or measures have already been introduced at the state level in 35 states, including 36 still-active bitcoin reserve bills. The Texas Senate passed a strategic bitcoin reserve bill on March 6 by a vote of 25-5, and Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed the Bitcoin Rights Act into law on March 24. Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order creating the Bitcoin Strategic Reserve and Digital Asset Reserve, which will initially use cryptocurrency seized in government criminal cases.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-31 17:49:54

In one of his latest statements, Musk mentioned that the government entity he heads, D.O.G.E, shall not integrate the use of Dogecoin into its operations in any way. While this may have been a shock for Dogecoin investors, the demand for Shiba Inu, Pepe, and other meme coins didn’t seem to be affected much, indicating the likelihood of funds from Dogecoin now flowing to other high-potential meme coins. If this indeed is the way the meme coin space plays out, then the project listed below may definitely be worth watching out for. Best Crypto to Buy Now BTC Bull When Dogecoin falters, attention doesn’t vanish—it simply repositions. BTC Bull is a presale that’s been building a narrative ready to intercept that shift. Rather than creating a new meme out of thin air, it pulls directly from the mythos of Bitcoin while anchoring itself to a system of rewards and scarcity. Every growth milestone unlocks fresh airdrops for holders. These aren’t just giveaways—they function as momentum markers, encouraging the community to scale together. A burn protocol runs in the background, gradually cutting supply as demand grows, amplifying pressure for those who wait too long to get in. And the market has responded. With more than $4.29 million raised, BTC Bull has quietly become one of the more heavily supported presales of the season, without relying on flash marketing or artificial hype. In a moment where meme coin capital is likely looking for its next home, BTC Bull offers more than a joke or a trend. It presents structure, pacing, and long-term strategy—three things most meme coins never get around to offering. Catslap Catslap doesn’t try to philosophize meme culture. It leans fully into the ridiculous, which might be exactly what works in a moment like this. With Dogecoin stepping off the main stage, traders are searching for tokens that don’t take themselves too seriously—but still offer room to grow. A cat slapping a celebrity is absurd, visual, and instantly shareable. That’s the pitch, and somehow, it’s working. The token gained early traction through pure virality, but its pull hasn’t faded. What makes it timely now is its current price level. Catslap is trading at a significant discount from its earlier range, meaning entry at this point carries far more upside potential if interest begins to cycle back toward novelty-based meme assets. Crypto YouTuber Austin Hilton claimed that the project had potential for major growth—a sentiment furthered by several other crypto content creators. The team has hinted at gamified extensions that bring the slap meme to life, adding another layer to the project beyond the token alone. While most meme coins burn out after launch, Catslap has kept its rhythm intact by staying culturally active—without overstaying its welcome. With Dogecoin slipping and visual-first tokens getting another round of engagement, Catslap might have just the right mix of simplicity, humor, and timing to thrive in this next phase. Meme Index The fragmentation of meme coin trading is both its charm and its curse. With every shift in sentiment, there’s a new batch of tokens gaining traction, and it’s rarely the same set two weeks in a row. That’s where Meme Index becomes not just relevant—but necessary. This project creates a structured index of the most active meme tokens in real time, adjusting its makeup based on volume, engagement, and token performance. Instead of forcing investors to chase every new coin manually, Meme Index handles that rotation inside one token. In light of Dogecoin’s drop, there’s no shortage of speculation brewing. Traders are watching for which meme coins might absorb that attention. Meme Index doesn’t make that bet—it absorbs whichever coin ends up winning. This approach doesn’t promise the highest gain on a single token, but it dramatically increases the chance of catching the next mover before it peaks. With over $4 million already raised in its presale, it’s clear the community sees value in a model that mirrors the meme market’s chaos without being consumed by it. Meme Index isn’t trying to be the next meme icon. It’s built to catch the ones that come and go—and collect the upside every time they do. MIND of Pepe Meme coins often follow social chatter—but MIND of Pepe is designed to follow it first. Instead of just being a token with an image and a slogan, it’s powered by an AI engine trained to read the mood of the market as it unfolds. It pulls in sentiment data across forums, platforms, and trading communities to figure out where attention is heading before most traders realize it. This isn’t guesswork. The AI isn’t trying to predict value—it’s tracking what people are reacting to in real time. For meme coin holders, that edge can matter a lot, especially when movements are often fueled more by excitement than by charts. Control the Universe. $MIND pic.twitter.com/g9PvY7zpJA — MIND of Pepe (@MINDofPepe) March 31, 2025 MIND of Pepe gives holders access to these trend signals, positioning them with early information before the noise gets too loud. And people have taken notice. Its presale has already pulled in over $7.7 million, suggesting a strong belief in the concept and its ability to serve a purpose beyond just laughs. With Dogecoin’s influence waning and the meme space scrambling for a new axis, MIND of Pepe doesn’t need to become the loudest token in the room. It just needs to stay aware of who is. Solaxy Every market shift pushes people toward movement—whether that’s buying, swapping, or switching chains altogether. Solaxy is built for those moments. While most meme tokens focus on content, Solaxy focuses on motion. It allows users to move assets across Ethereum, Solana, and other supported chains without hitting the typical roadblocks that slow down the process. Its design solves something that isn’t glamorous but is always essential: how to keep up with activity when volume starts to climb. As the market gears up for its next phase, having a way to act quickly across networks becomes less of a bonus and more of a necessity. Solaxy is already backed with confidence—its presale has crossed the $28 million mark, putting it in a rare category of pre-launch projects that are both well-funded and functionally sharp. It also offers staking opportunities for those who prefer to play the longer game. That balance between utility and passive value gives the token some flexibility no matter how fast things move. It isn’t about hype, mascots, or buzzwords. It’s about speed, access, and keeping users from missing out when attention moves faster than the platforms they’re using. And right now, that’s exactly the kind of infrastructure the meme world quietly depends on. Conclusion Dogecoin’s dip may have spooked some holders, but it also opened the door for other projects to prove they’re more than just placeholders. As attention shifts and traders look for the next spark, the tokens covered above each offer something different—some are built to capture humor and culture, others focus on tools and movement. This isn’t just about finding the next meme. It’s about recognizing where sentiment might travel next and being positioned before it gets crowded. For those still watching from the sidelines, these presales could be the entry points worth taking seriously. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

GameStop’s board of directors unanimously approved last week to use both corporate cash and future capital raises to purchase crypto assets, notably Bitcoin ( BTC ). The short-term result? A 22% plunge in GameStop’s share price, its worst day since June. Not off to a good start. Cue the “You Died” screen. A slight bounce on Monday now brings its year-to-date gain to negative 28.64%, although it is still up 82% from a year ago. But beneath the market volatility lies a longer-term strategy that could position GameStop for a turnaround. According to commentary sent to crypto.news from Mateusz Kara, CEO of Ari10, the company’s Bitcoin move should be seen not as a potential turnaround in its core business, rather a calculated bet on a financial reinvention. “GameStop has decided to invest in Bitcoin. Why? It’s simple: the company sees that, in the long term, it is a very profitable investment,” the CEO noted. “An example is how Strategy is making money on Bitcoin.” Certainly the timing for GameStop was not ideal with Bitcoin’s recent price dip. But this does give GameStop favorable entry points, although investors my need some convincing. It’s like buying the Master Sword with one heart left—risky, but potentially game-changin g. Read more: Strive CEO urges GameStop to adopt Bitcoin as treasury asset GameStop needs a new vibe Indeed, there are strategic branding benefits, according to Kara. Investing in Bitcoin is “somewhat fashionable now” and “can improve GameStop’s image.” This is especially true with younger investors who may view the company as a more dynamic, crypto-aligned play and not a brick and mortar retailer whose path into oblivion has been obvious to many for at least 10 years. Basically, they’re trying to evolve from Magikarp to Gyarados (shout out to my daughter for this one!) GameStop’s shares may currently look cheap, but some of that is due to typical “buy the rumor, sell the fact” dynamics. Investors chased the initial Bitcoin speculation but ran away just as fast once the debt-funded plan became official. Trump to the rescue? Uncertainty tied to Donald Trump’s evolving economic policies, particularly tariffs, also continues to weigh on broader market sentiment, a statement Kara doesn’t seem to agree with. “In the long run, U.S. policy may raise Bitcoin’s valuation—which will contribute to GameStop’s share price,” the CEO said. As for whether this move makes GameStop the next MicroStrategy Strategy , that’s far from certain. In terms of legacy stock market-listed companies hoarding Bitcoin, Strategy is the OG and everyone else is copying. It’s like everyone suddenly trying to be the main character in a Final Fantasy game . Unlike Strategy, GameStop is already trading at a hefty premium to its cash holdings. But with a refreshed narrative, retail loyalty, and now a Bitcoin bull case, the original meme stock may still have the ability to charge higher. Or maybe not. Press F to pay respects .

Experts believe that investors can gain up to 3× of their Investmentwithin a month if they buy now. Sounds amazing, right? But did you know that you can make even more profit if you invest in projects in their presale stage, like Panshibi ? Let’s get into the details and contrast PEPE and SHIBI: How PEPE Coins Remains a Powerhouse PEPE Coin is arguably one of the most outstanding meme coins in the market. Admittedly, its price has recently dipped , however, there's signs that it will bounce back soon. PEPE manages to stay at the top by combining meme coin features with real life utility. Once considered just another meme token, PEPE has transcended expectations, finding its way into the pockets of investors. Recent PEPE coin news indicates that the token is likely going to witness a huge breakout within the next month. The metrics used for this prediction evolve around PEPE’s community-driven momentum, as well as speculative interest, which allows it to maintain relevance even as the market gets more competitive. As PEPE still rides the current of investor interest, its peak days seem to be over, as the most it could offer investors is about 3× of their Investment. So what happens if you want more? Panshibi (SHIBI) has emerged as a solid competitor. Still in its presale stage, it offers investors an opportunity to make up to 50× of their Investment. Panshibi (SHIBI): The Next Big Meme Coin to Watch? Panshibi is similar to PEPE in so many ways, for starters it combines momentum associated with meme coins with advanced blockchain functionality. However, SHIBI isn’t your average meme token. The project aims to offer real-world use cases and unique mechanics that could help it stand out from other meme coins. SHIBI implements a burn mechanism to decrease supply over time, giving it potential scarcity and value. Unlike ordinary meme tokens, the project integrates staking, play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, and DeFi components to provide a more robust ecosystem. Drawing inspiration from the success of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, the roadmap for Panshibi is poised for the long haul. PEPE vs. SHIBI: Which One Should You Choose? Despite their similarities, PEPE and SHIBI also come with distinct advantages that could make them stay relevant and offer investors huge profits. However, if it comes down to choosing one out of the two, it all depends on your risk appetite and strategy. PEPE has a huge fan base, which helps it build speculation and gain value even when the general market is down, while Panshibi (SHIBI) is newer but with huge potential. This means that if you are looking for a relatively more stable crypto, PEPE should be at the top of your list. But if you want huge profits within a short period of time, Panshibi should be your first choice. Should You Buy SHIBI Now? With PEPE coin news suggesting bullish trends for PEPE, the cryptocurrency is still a good option for short-term traders. However, for those searching for a presale opportunity in a meme coin with huge profit margins and long-term potential, Panshibi can prove to be a game-changing investment. With the rising potential of both tokens alongside the changing crypto landscape, there is without a doubt the potential for gains with both tokens, and maybe adding a combination of both in a portfolio could be the safest bet. While PEPE can make you 3x richer, Panshibi can change your life. Keep an eye on SHIBI as the meme coin revolution unfolds. Visit the Website , Telegram, or Twitter to get started.

42709045,https://cointelegraph.com/news/trump-s-focus-on-cartels,1743444000,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png,Trump’s focus on cartels highlights new risks for digital assets,https://cointelegraph.com/news/trump-s-focus-on-cartels?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Opinion by: Genny Ngai and Will Roth of Morrison Cohen LLP Since taking office, the Trump administration has designated several drug and violent cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) and Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs). US President Donald Trump has also called for the “total elimination” of these cartels and the like. These executive directives are not good developments for the cryptocurrency industry. On their face, these mandates appear focused only on criminal cartels. Make no mistake: These executive actions will cause unforeseen collateral damage to the digital asset community. Crypto actors, including software developers and investors, may very well get caught in the crosshairs of aggressive anti-terrorism prosecutions and follow-on civil lawsuits. Increased threat of criminal anti-terrorism investigations The biggest threat stemming from Trump’s executive order on cartels is the Department of Justice (DOJ). Almost immediately after President Trump called for the designation of cartels as terrorists, the DOJ issued a memo directing federal prosecutors to use “the most serious and broad charges,” including anti-terrorism charges, against cartels and transnational criminal organizations. This is a new and serious development for prosecutors. Now that cartels are designated as terrorist organizations, prosecutors can go beyond the traditional drug and money-laundering statutes and rely on criminal anti-terrorism statutes like 18 U.S.C. § 2339B — the material-support statute — to investigate cartels and anyone who they believe “knowingly provides material support or resources” to the designated cartels. Why should the crypto industry be concerned with these developments? Because “material support or resources” is not just limited to providing physical weapons to terrorists. “Material support or resources” is broadly defined as “any property, tangible or intangible, or service.” Anyone who knowingly provides anything of value to a designated cartel could now conceivably violate § 2339B. Even though cryptocurrency platforms are not financial institutions and never take custody of users’ assets, aggressive prosecutors may take the hardline view that software developers who design crypto platforms — and those who fund these protocols — are providing “material support or resources” to terrorists and launch harmful investigations against them. This is not some abstract possibility. The government has already demonstrated a willingness to take this aggressive position against the crypto industry. For example, the DOJ indicted the developers of the blockchain-based software protocol Tornado Cash on money laundering and sanction charges and accused them of operating a large-scale money laundering operation that laundered at least $1 billion in criminal proceeds for cybercriminals, including a sanctioned North Korean hacking group. Recent: Crypto crime in 2024 likely exceeded $51B, far higher than reported: Chainalysis Moreover, the government already believes that cartels use cryptocurrency to launder drug proceeds and has brought numerous cases charging individuals for laundering drug proceeds through cryptocurrency on behalf of Mexican and Colombian drug cartels. TRM Labs, a blockchain intelligence company that helps detect crypto crime , has even identified how the Sinaloa drug cartel — a recently designated FTO/SDGT — has used cryptocurrency platforms to launder drug proceeds. The digital asset community faces real risks here. Putting aside the reputational damage and costs that come from defending criminal anti-terrorism investigations, violations of § 2339B impose a statutory maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years (or life if a death occurred) and monetary penalties. Anti-terrorism statutes also have extraterritorial reach, so crypto companies outside the US are not immune to investigation or prosecution. Civil anti-terrorism lawsuits will escalate The designation of cartels as FTOs/SDGTs will also increase the rate at which crypto companies will be sued under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA). Under the ATA, private citizens, or their representatives, can sue terrorists for their injuries, and anyone “who aids and abets, by knowingly providing substantial assistance, or who conspires with the person who committed such an act of international terrorism.” Aggressive plaintiffs’ counsel have already relied on the ATA to sue cryptocurrency companies in court. After Binance and its founder pled guilty to criminal charges in late 2023, US victims of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel sued Binance and its founder under the ATA , alleging that the defendants knowingly provided a “mechanism for Hamas and other terrorist groups to raise funds and transact illicit business in support of terrorist activities” and that Binance processed nearly $60 million in crypto transactions for these terrorists. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted in part and denied in part. For now, the district court permits the Ranaan plaintiffs to proceed against Binance with their aiding-and-abetting theory. Crypto companies should expect to see more ATA lawsuits now that drug cartels are on the official terrorist list. Vigilance is key Crypto companies may think that Trump’s war against cartels has nothing to do with them. The reality is, however, that the effects of this war will be widespread, and crypto companies may be unwittingly drawn into the crossfire. Now is not the time for the digital asset community to relax internal compliance measures. With anti-terrorism statutes in play, crypto companies must ensure that transactions with all FTOs/SDGTs are identified and blocked, monitor for new terrorist designations, and understand areas of new geographical risks.

In his annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that US dollar supremacy can’t last forever and is already being weakened – not only due to skyrocketing debt but also the rise of digital assets and decentralized finance (DeFi). Says Fink, “The U.S. has benefited from the dollar serving as the world’s reserve currency for decades. But that’s not guaranteed to last forever. The national debt has grown at three times the pace of GDP since Times Square’s debt clock started ticking in 1989.57 This year, interest payments will surpass $952 billion— exceeding defense spending. By 2030, mandatory government spending and debt service will consume all federal revenue, creating a permanent deficit. If the U.S. doesn’t get its debt under control, if deficits keep ballooning, America risks losing that position to digital assets like Bitcoin. To be clear, I’m obviously not anti-digital assets (far from it; see the next section). But two things can be true at the same time: Decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation. It makes markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent. Yet that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar.” BlackRock heavily invested in Bitcoin in 2024 with the launch of its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which would ultimately become the most successful exchange-traded fund (ETF) launch of all time. Fink, who oversees $11.5 trillion in assets at BlackRock, notes how the world’s financial system runs on “plumbing built when trading floors still shouted orders and fax machines felt revolutionary,” opening the door for smoother, faster technology like blockchain-based tokenization. The CEO says, “If SWIFT is the postal service, tokenization is email itself.” “Every stock, every bond, every fund—every asset—can be tokenized. If they are, it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth. Perhaps most importantly, tokenization makes investing much more democratic.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Meanwhile, former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes, along with his co-founders, received pardons from President Trump after a lengthy legal battle over regulatory violations. Crypto news that flew under the radar. FTX to Begin Paying Major Creditors in May 2025 FTX, the once-prominent cryptocurrency exchange led by Sam Bankman-Fried, has reached a crucial moment in its ongoing bankruptcy saga. Nearly two and a half years after its dramatic collapse, FTX has announced it will begin paying its major creditors on May 30, 2025. The company has now accumulated $11.4 billion in cash to distribute to creditors with claims exceeding $50,000. Smaller creditors, with claims under $50,000, have already begun receiving payments, and most were compensated within two months of the repayment plan’s initiation. FTX’s collapse followed shocking revelations that Bankman-Fried had misused customer funds to support his hedge fund, Alameda Research. It filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. Despite these challenges, the now-defunct crypto exchange’s recovery efforts have been led by John J. Ray III, who previously oversaw the dissolution of Enron. Under his leadership, FTX’s estate managed to reclaim significant assets, including stakes in tech firms and cryptocurrency holdings, exceeding the company’s original $11.2 billion liabilities. As a result, creditors are set to receive payouts amounting to 118-119% of their original claims. However, the repayment is based on the value of cryptocurrencies as of November 2022, which has left many creditors frustrated, as Bitcoin and other assets have soared in value since then. Arthur Hayes and BitMEX Leaders Pardoned by Trump In yet another significant development, Arthur Hayes, the former CEO of BitMEX, has been granted a pardon by US President Donald Trump, alongside his co-founders Samuel Reed and Benjamin Delo, as well as senior employee Greg Dwyer and the exchange’s operating entity, HDR Global Trading. This decision comes after a turbulent legal battle, which began in 2020 when the US Department of Justice (DOJ) charged BitMEX and its leadership with violations of the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). The charges centered around the platform’s failure to implement basic customer identification procedures, which allowed users to trade anonymously without meeting know-your-customer (KYC) requirements. The individuals involved all pleaded guilty and received probationary sentences, while the exchange itself settled charges by admitting to BSA violations last year. In addition to the DOJ case, BitMEX also faced a significant penalty from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which fined the exchange $100 million for breaching the Commodity Exchange Act in 2021. This latest pardon follows Trump’s earlier decision to grant clemency to Silk Road creator Ross Ulbricht. Meanwhile, Bankman-Fried, the disgraced founder of FTX, has made repeated efforts to secure a pardon, even attempting to influence Trump’s administration by participating in an unauthorized jailhouse interview.

Following the news, XRP ( XRP ) surged to $2.59, but the gains gradually faded as the cryptocurrency experienced a 22% correction, dropping to $2.02 by March 31. Investors worry that a deeper price correction is imminent, as XRP is trading 39% below its all-time high of $3.40 from Jan. 16. Additionally, XRP perpetual futures (inverse swaps) indicate strong demand for leveraged bearish bets. Demand for bearish bets increased amid XRP’s decline The funding rate turns positive when longs (buyers) seek more leverage and negative when demand for shorts (sellers) dominates. In neutral markets, it typically fluctuates between 0.1% and 0.3% per seven days to offset exchange risks and capital costs. Conversely, negative funding rates are considered strong bearish signals. XRP futures 8-hour funding rate. Source: Laevitas.ch Currently, the XRP funding rate stands at -0.14% per eight hours, translating to a 0.3% weekly cost. This indicates that bearish traders are paying for leverage, reflecting weak investor confidence in XRP. However, traders should also assess XRP margin demand to determine whether the bearish sentiment extends beyond futures markets. Unlike derivative contracts, which always require both a buyer and a seller, margin markets let traders borrow stablecoins to buy spot XRP. Likewise, bearish traders can borrow XRP to open short positions, anticipating a price drop. XRP margin long-to-short ratio at OKX. Source: OKX The XRP long-to-short margin ratio at OKX stands at 2x in favor of longs (buyers), near its lowest level in over six months. Historically, extreme confidence has pushed this metric above 40x, while readings below 5x favoring longs are typically seen as bearish signals. President Trump boosted XRP awareness, paving the way for future price gains Both XRP derivatives and margin markets signal bearish momentum, even as the cryptocurrency gains mainstream media attention. Notably, on March 2, US President Donald Trump mentioned XRP , along with Solana ( SOL ) and Cardano ( ADA ), as potential candidates for the country’s digital asset strategic reserves. Google search trends for XRP and BTC. Source: GoogleTrends / Cointelegraph For a brief period, Google search trends for XRP outpaced those of BTC between March 2 and March 3. A similar spike occurred on March 19 following Ripple CEO Garlinghouse’s comments on the anticipated SEC ruling. As the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization (excluding stablecoins), XRP benefits from its early adoption and high liquidity. Related: Is XRP price around $2 an opportunity or the bull market's end? Analysts weigh in Interactive Brokers, a global traditional finance brokerage, announced on March 26 its expansion of cryptocurrency offerings to include SOL, ADA, XRP, and Dogecoin ( DOGE ). Since 2021, the platform has supported trading in Bitcoin (BTC), Ether ( ETH ), Litecoin (LTC), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) pairs. The wider adoption by traditional intermediaries, combined with rising Google search trends, further reinforces XRP’s position as a leading altcoin. It also sets the stage for increased inflows once macroeconomic conditions improve and retail investors actively seek altcoins with strong marketing appeal as alternatives to traditional finance, such as Ripple.

A crew of four is preparing for an unusual journey into space, one that no human has attempted before: flying directly over the Earth’s North and South Poles. The mission, carried out by Elon Musk ‘s SpaceX and called Fram2, is being financed by Chun Wang, a Malta-based cryptocurrency investor who built his fortune in Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining. The team, launching aboard a SpaceX capsule, includes three adventurers Wang met through polar expeditions: Norwegian filmmaker Jannicke Mikkelsen, German robotics researcher Rabea Rogge, and Australian explorer Eric Philips. None of them have been to space before. Set to lift off from Florida late Monday night at 9:46 p.m. ET, the mission will take the crew on a path no human spaceflight has traveled. While some satellites use polar orbits for Earth observation, human missions have generally followed paths closer to the equator. Fram2 will aim for a true 90-degree inclination, meaning it will fly directly over both poles. At one point, F2Pool grew to be one of the largest mining pools in the Bitcoin network, contributing a significant portion of the network’s hash rate. Bitcoin mining pools distribution | Source: Hashrate Index But as the Bitcoin mining space became more competitive with the rise of American and Russian miners, F2Pool’s role has become smaller. Today, it accounts for just over 10% of Bitcoin’s total hash rate, according to data from Hashrate Index. You might also like: Bitcoin miners earned record $2b before halving Mined over 7,000 BTC It’s unclear how much Chun paid for the multi-day flight. In a 2022 interview for Staking Rewards, Chun said that during the first two years of F2Pool’s existence, he “personally mined 7,700 Bitcoin,” valued as of press time at around $640 million, though Chun admitted that he sold all of his BTC mined in early days. “I sold all the Bitcoin from 2011 and 2012 in January 2013 and paid back my initial loan. I borrowed some money from my parents to build the first GPU configuration. I think the price I sold at was like $11.” Chun Wang The space mission offers multiple opportunities for research. For instance, the crew will participate in studies on the effects of space travel on the human body, including brain fluid shifts and sleep disruptions. They will undergo MRI scans similar to those conducted on SpaceX’s 2024 Polaris Dawn mission. As early as March 31st at 9:46 p.m. ET, SpaceX will launch Fram2, the first human spaceflight mission to explore Earth from a polar orbit. Fram2 will lift off from Florida and will last about three and a half days.

More than 60% of astronauts experience nausea in microgravity. Astronauts experiencing severe symptoms may use anti-nausea injections, but these can cause grogginess. The Fram2 team hopes to contribute to developing better treatments. Gender gap in space On top of that, the mission will also include an experiment by British startup Hormona, which aims to track hormone fluctuations in female astronauts. Mikkelsen and Rogge will use urine test strips during the flight. Jasmine Tagesson, Hormona’s co-founder, told CNN in an interview that the flight could potentially help close “a gender data gap in medicine” as only about 15% of the more than 700 people who have traveled to space have been women. Dr. Jerilynn Prior, a professor of medicine at the University of British Columbia, noted that stressors in space could disrupt ovulation. “At the very least, the stress involved would likely shorten the luteal phase,” she said. Aside from medical studies, Fram2 will conduct a range of experiments, including growing mushrooms in space, testing exercise routines in microgravity, and observing polar auroras from orbit. Additionally, the crew will attempt to document Steve, a mysterious auroral phenomenon identified in 2016. “Taking photographs of aurora from space hasn’t been done extensively,” noted Dr. Eric Donovan, an expert in space physics at the University of Calgary. The crew is expected to spend three to five days in orbit before returning to Earth with a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.

In his annual letter released earlier today, he warned that America’s debt crisis is pushing investors to rethink their strategies. He said the U.S. financial crisis has made Bitcoin (BTC) more appealing to investors . He also revealed that blockchain technology and tokenization could reshape crypto investment, making it easier and more mainstream. Revelation on America’s Debt Problem is Getting Worse Larry Fink’s opinion carries weight in the financial world, and his latest insight shows a possible change in how people invest their money. He pointed out a troubling trend: America’s debt is growing faster than its economy. Since 1989, the national debt has increased three times faster than the country’s income (GDP). He forecasted that in 2025, the U.S. government will spend $952 billion just to pay interest on its debt this year, more than the budget spent on national defense. Looking ahead, Fink warned that by 2030, all federal revenue might go toward mandatory spending and debt payments. He revealed that this could leave the country with a permanent budget deficit. Fink’s concerns align with the broader economic crisis ongoing in the country. Recently, authorities released the core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) data, shockingly the inflation rate was higher than expected . Experts worry this could force the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates high, worsening America’s financial situation. Fink on The Bitcoin Appeal in The US BlackRock CEO revealed that investors are turning to Bitcoin as a safe investment option amidst financial struggles. Fink acknowledged that decentralized finance (DeFi) is a major innovation. However, he warned that if people continue to see the digital asset as a safer investment than the dollar, it could weaken America’s economic position. Fink also believed in Bitcoin potential as a hedge against inflation. Last October, projected the possibility of Bitcoin’s market value to reach a whopping $50 trillion . Likewise, BlackRock’s Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) has already proven how big crypto can get. Since launching in 2024, the investment fund has pulled in over $48 billion from investors, bringing Bitcoin further into the mainstream. BlackRock CEO on Future of Tokenization While Bitcoin is gaining attention, Fink believes blockchain technology has even greater potential. He sees tokenization as the future of finance. Tokenization turns assets like stocks or real estate into digital tokens on a blockchain, making buying and selling easier and reducing costs. It also allows fractional ownership, letting investors buy small shares of expensive assets like real estate and private equity. This could open up investment opportunities for more people and make markets more efficient.

Prices steadily fell from a low of $1766.31 toward $3020.97 at its high, reflecting consistent downward pressure and waning momentum over time. The current range lies between $1766.31 and $3020.97, with immediate support near $1294.44 and resistance around $3803.76. Indicators such as a 33.12 RSI and negative momentum favor bears, and no clear trend is evident. Traders could look for rebound opportunities at support or test the resistance if bullish pressure strengthens. Jupiter (JUP): Price Action Favors Bears Amid Key Resistance & Support Zones Jupiter experienced a 41.98% drop in the past month and a 45.83% decline over six months. A 19.54% decrease in just one week highlights ongoing downward pressure in its recent performance. Oscillators confirm the lack of positive momentum. The price action over these periods shows persistent bearish sentiment and a struggle to build upward strength. Currently, Jupiter trades between $0.57 and $1.01, with immediate support near $0.38 and resistance at $1.26, while a second resistance sits at $1.71. Bears dominate the market, and the absence of a clear recovery trend suggests caution. Trading ideas include monitoring the channel closely and considering short-term positions near key support and resistance levels. Conclusion ETH and JUP have shown steady support levels, prompting mid-term investors to accumulate more. These coins' stability reassures holders and new buyers. Their resilience invites confidence in sustained performance. This trend suggests a favorable outlook for those considering long-term growth. Both assets’ strong support foundations indicate potential for future gains, making them attractive for investors looking to expand their portfolio.

42710840,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144727,1743447074,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revolutionary American Bitcoin: Hut 8 and Eric Trump Forge New Mining Standard,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/american-bitcoin-hut8-eric-trump/,"The cryptocurrency world is buzzing with a new and potentially game-changing development. Leading Bitcoin mining firm Hut 8 has announced a groundbreaking partnership with Eric Trump, son of former U.S. President Donald Trump, to launch a venture called American Bitcoin . This ambitious project is not just about mining more Bitcoin; it’s about setting a new, higher standard for the entire BTC mining industry. But what exactly does this mean for the future of Bitcoin and crypto mining? Let’s dive into the details of this exciting announcement and explore its potential implications. Introducing American Bitcoin: A New Era for BTC Mining Standards In a recent announcement that sent ripples through the crypto community, PANews reported on X (formerly Twitter) that Hut 8 and Eric Trump are collaborating to establish American Bitcoin . The core mission of this venture is ambitious yet clear: to redefine and elevate the benchmarks for BTC mining standards . This isn’t simply about increasing hash rates or expanding mining operations; it’s about a holistic approach to mining that could encompass various aspects, from sustainability and energy efficiency to security and transparency. But what exactly might these new standards look like? Sustainability Focus: With growing environmental concerns around Bitcoin mining, American Bitcoin could prioritize sustainable energy sources and eco-friendly mining practices. Enhanced Security Measures: Setting new security benchmarks could involve implementing advanced protocols to protect against cyber threats and ensure the integrity of mining operations. Increased Transparency: In an industry sometimes criticized for opacity, American Bitcoin might aim for greater transparency in its operations, perhaps through regular reporting and audits. Operational Efficiency: Beyond just hash rate, efficiency could be redefined to include optimal resource utilization, reduced waste, and innovative mining techniques. The promise of setting new BTC mining standards suggests a move towards a more responsible and robust Bitcoin mining ecosystem. But how will American Bitcoin achieve this, and what role does Eric Trump play in this venture? Why Eric Trump? The Trump Name and the Power of Influence The involvement of Eric Trump in American Bitcoin immediately raises eyebrows and sparks curiosity. Why partner with a member of the Trump family? The answer likely lies in the powerful brand recognition and political influence associated with the Trump name. In a sector that is increasingly navigating regulatory landscapes and public perception, having a figure like Eric Trump onboard could offer several advantages: Brand Visibility: The Trump name is globally recognized. This partnership instantly elevates the visibility of American Bitcoin and Hut 8, drawing attention from mainstream media and potential investors beyond the crypto-native audience. Political Connections: While Donald Trump is no longer in office, the Trump family retains significant political connections and influence within certain segments of the U.S. political landscape. This could be beneficial in navigating regulatory discussions and policy changes related to cryptocurrency and mining. Market Trust: For some investors and stakeholders, the association with a prominent American family might instill a sense of trust and legitimacy, particularly in a relatively nascent and often volatile industry like crypto mining. Advocacy Platform: Eric Trump’s involvement provides a platform to advocate for Bitcoin mining and the broader crypto industry within political and public spheres, potentially countering negative narratives and promoting favorable policies. However, the partnership also presents potential challenges. The Trump name is politically polarizing, and associating with it could alienate certain segments of the market. Moreover, the crypto community is generally decentralized and values independence from traditional political and financial systems. Navigating these complexities will be crucial for the success of American Bitcoin . Hut 8: The Mining Powerhouse Behind American Bitcoin While Eric Trump brings brand recognition and potential influence, Hut 8 brings the operational expertise and infrastructure. Hut 8 is not a newcomer to the Bitcoin mining scene; it is a publicly traded company with a strong track record and significant presence in the industry. Here’s a quick look at what makes Hut 8 a key player: Aspect Hut 8 Highlights Mining Infrastructure Operates large-scale Bitcoin mining facilities across North America. Publicly Traded Listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (HUT) and Nasdaq (HUT), providing transparency and accountability. Experienced Team Boasts a management team with extensive experience in finance, technology, and energy sectors. Diversified Revenue Streams Beyond Bitcoin mining , Hut 8 also explores other revenue opportunities within the digital asset ecosystem. Commitment to Innovation Continuously invests in research and development to improve mining efficiency and sustainability. Hut 8’s established infrastructure and operational capabilities provide a solid foundation for American Bitcoin to achieve its ambitious goals. Their expertise in navigating the technical and logistical challenges of Bitcoin mining will be invaluable in setting and implementing these new industry standards. The Future Landscape of Bitcoin Mining: American Bitcoin’s Vision The launch of American Bitcoin comes at a pivotal time for the cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin mining is facing increasing scrutiny regarding its environmental impact, energy consumption, and geographical concentration. Against this backdrop, American Bitcoin’s focus on setting new, higher standards could be a significant step towards shaping a more sustainable and responsible future for the sector. Consider these potential future implications: Driving Industry Evolution: If American Bitcoin successfully establishes and implements higher standards, it could incentivize other mining firms to follow suit, leading to a broader industry shift towards more sustainable and ethical practices. Attracting Institutional Investment: Increased focus on sustainability and transparency could make Bitcoin mining more attractive to institutional investors who are increasingly conscious of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors. Shaping Regulatory Discussions: Proactive efforts to raise BTC mining standards could positively influence regulatory conversations, potentially leading to more favorable and less restrictive policies for the industry. Boosting Public Perception: Demonstrating a commitment to responsible mining practices can improve public perception of Bitcoin and the crypto industry as a whole, addressing some of the negative narratives surrounding environmental impact. American Bitcoin is more than just a new mining operation; it represents a bold vision for the future of Bitcoin mining . By combining Hut 8’s operational prowess with the brand influence of Eric Trump, this venture has the potential to be a catalyst for positive change within the industry. Whether it will fully realize its ambitious goals remains to be seen, but the launch of American Bitcoin is undoubtedly a development worth watching closely. In conclusion, the partnership between Hut 8 and Eric Trump to launch American Bitcoin signals a significant development in the cryptocurrency mining landscape. Their stated aim to set new BTC mining standards addresses critical challenges and opportunities within the industry, from sustainability and security to public perception and regulatory engagement. While questions remain about the specific details and long-term impact of this venture, the ambition and the combined strengths of Hut 8 and Eric Trump position American Bitcoin as a potentially transformative force in the evolution of Bitcoin mining.

In an interview with CNBC, Lee said that despite recent price weakness , current conditions offer a good entry point for long-term investors. “I think so,” Lee replied when asked if now is a good time to be “stacking” Bitcoin ( BTC ). “Part of this was that Bitcoin seasonally was just not going to be attractive until after March ends. And now we’re finally exiting March.” Lee pointed to macroeconomic and political catalysts that suggest “the calendar is looking better”. This could help Bitcoin rally through the end of the year. Notably, the Federal Reserve and central banks are easing and quantiativetightening is ending. Coupled with “positive Washington tailwinds,” Bitcoin “can do well until the end of the year.” You might also like: Bitcoin likely to slip below $80k this week: 10x $150k or higher is ‘possible’ Lee reiterated his long-standing bullish outlook on Bitcoin, maintaining a year-end target of at least $150,000. “I know it doesn’t feel like it, but once we get through this [Trump’s] tariff agenda, markets can look forward to things that could be positive,” he explained. On the topic of the U.S. dollar and crypto’s role in global markets, Lee agreed with recent comments from BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, who warned that U.S. protectionist policy could undermine the dollar’s strength. However, Lee believes that smart stablecoin regulation could actually protect the dollar’s dominance. “In crypto, when it comes to stablecoins, the dollar is way more dominant there than it is in traditional markets,” he said. “So I think you actually kind of protect the dollar with stablecoin legislation.” As April begins, Lee’s message to investors is clear: the worst may be behind us, and the path forward could lead to new all-time highs.

The head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) noted that the government agency only bears a nominal resemblance to the memecoin. Elon Musk Dispels Rumors Of Dogecoin Adoption By The US Government At a recent event, Tesla CEO Elon Musk cleared the air on the potential adoption of Dogecoin by the US government. In his keynote speech , Musk noted that the US government will not be adopting Dogecoin, contrary to swirling speculation. Musk noted that the speculation gained traction following the launch of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Following the launch of DOGE and Musk tapped to lead the agency, enthusiasm for Dogecoin government utility reached new highs. However, Musk clarified that the agency bears only a nominal resemblance to the memecoin, stemming from an internet trend. The Tesla CEO disclosed that the original intended name was the Government Efficiency Commission, opting for DOGE “because the internet is right.” “The name is similar but they are two different things,” said Musk. “But there are no plans for the government to use Dogecoin as far as I know.” Musk has a long and storied history with Dogecoin, famously shilling the memecoin and integrating DOGE payments for Tesla. Musk teased an anime-themed DOGE on X, setting the stage for a $2 rally for the memecoin. DOGE Reacts Negatively To The News Dogecoin price slumped by nearly 2% in the wake of the grim report. Currently, the memecoin is trading at 0.1660 as it eyes a push toward the $1 mark. The negative fundamental adds pressure to reports of DOGE forming a falling wedge pattern , signaling a potential downward breakout. However, optimists are rippling with confidence that DOGE can shake off the negative sentiments to post new all-time highs. One analysis claims that if the Dogecoin price breaks a 3-month trendline, an $8 valuation for the memecoin is in play. Others claim that the House of Doge Reserve launch will be a tailwind for Dogecoin price, sending the dog-themed coin on a strong rally.

42711140,https://crypto.news/?p=14349334,1743447508,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/42711140.jpeg,A way out or a way around? Rethinking A16z’s crypto regulation Proposal,https://crypto.news/rethinking-a16zs-crypto-regulation-proposal/,"When SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce released her statement on February 21, 2025, titled “There Must Be Some Way Out of Here,” it didn’t read like a typical piece of regulatory commentary. The title, a nod to Bob Dylan’s “All Along the Watchtower,” set the tone: frustration, urgency, and maybe even a quiet plea for clarity. The SEC published a formal Request for Information — an open call for public input on how to determine whether crypto assets should be classified and regulated as securities. It was the first real invitation in years for the broader crypto ecosystem to help shape the rules. In response, on March 13, venture capital giant Andreessen Horowitz (A16z) submitted a proposal built around what it calls a “control-based decentralization framework.” The idea is this: if a blockchain network is open, autonomous, and no longer under the control of a central group, then the tokens operating on it shouldn’t be treated as securities. It’s a neat concept — clean, structured, and seemingly grounded in logic. But as I dug into the details and spoke with experts, including Alice Frei, Head of Security and Compliance at Outset PR , a more complicated picture began to emerge. Because while the proposal offers a potential “way out,” not everyone is convinced it leads anywhere good. The Promise — and Problem — of Technology-Neutral Regulation One of the pillars of A16z’s framework is the idea that crypto regulation should be both “merit-neutral” and “technology-neutral.” If a crypto token functions like a traditional asset — say, a share or bond — it should be treated the same way under the law. But Frei sees a disconnect. “A technology-neutral approach sounds fair in theory. But it just doesn’t apply cleanly to blockchain. Crypto isn’t a re-skin of the traditional financial system — it’s something fundamentally different. It constantly redefines its own economic and functional properties.” She pointed out how each major innovation in crypto introduced entirely new economic behaviors: Bitcoin with decentralized digital scarcity, Ethereum with programmable governance, DAOs with collective decision-making, NFTs with digital ownership, and DeFi with permissionless financial markets. “These aren’t just new wrappers for old assets. They come with entirely different risk models, incentive structures, and governance challenges. Ignoring that in the name of ‘neutrality’ means we’re regulating what crypto looks like — not what it is.” Code Isn’t the Only Force Driving Markets Another key argument in A16z’s proposal is that if a token’s design is fully embedded in code — meaning its economic logic is pre-programmed and autonomous — then its value shouldn’t be seen as relying on third-party efforts. And if that’s true, it wouldn’t pass the Howey test. But according to Frei, that logic doesn’t hold up in today’s markets. “Just because staking rewards or token burns are automated doesn’t mean the market is… Valuations in crypto are driven by much more than code. Speculation, sentiment, macro events — those things move prices just as much, if not more.” She pointed to Bitcoin’s price movements as an example. Its code may be predictable — fixed supply, halving cycles — but its valuation fluctuates wildly based on interest rates, institutional adoption, and even viral tweets. “Look at Terra. Its whole value proposition was a self-correcting, algorithmic stablecoin — a system designed to maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar through code-based incentives and automated supply adjustments. But even that couldn’t withstand a speculative run. Once confidence cracked, the algorithm spiraled out of control. Billions were wiped out in days. Code didn’t save it.” The Contradiction of ‘Control-Based Decentralization’ One of the more debated parts of A16z’s proposal is the phrase itself: control-based decentralization . According to the framework, if operational, economic, and governance control have been sufficiently diffused, the network should be considered decentralized — and therefore outside the SEC’s jurisdiction. But Frei challenged the idea that decentralization can be so cleanly measured. “Framing decentralization around the absence of control is already tricky. But when you start building checklists to define it, you risk mistaking surface-level decentralization for real autonomy.” In practice, she explained, most so-called decentralized systems still involve central points of influence. Developers retain control over upgrades. Governance tokens often concentrate power in the hands of early investors. And infrastructure like exchanges and custodians remain centralized chokepoints. “True decentralization is a spectrum,” she said. “It’s not a yes-or-no checkbox. And pretending it is opens the door to performative decentralization that looks good on paper but doesn’t hold up in reality.” A Potential Regulatory Loophole The bigger concern, Frei warned, is how easily A16z’s proposed framework could be exploited — especially without rigorous enforcement standards. “You could have a project that looks decentralized from the outside, but still has insiders pulling the strings.” That might mean token distributions that appear broad but are tightly coordinated behind the scenes. Or governance structures that seem democratic but are designed to funnel decision-making to a few wallets. Or protocols that shift control just long enough to pass a regulatory test, only to re-centralize later under different names. “If we’re not careful,” she said, “this becomes a guidebook for regulatory arbitrage. Not for transparency.” Where Do We Go From Here? To be clear, Frei doesn’t dismiss the effort behind A16z’s proposal. Like many in the industry, she welcomes the discussion and agrees that regulatory clarity is urgently needed. But she’s skeptical that a framework based on rigid decentralization checklists can truly reflect the complexity of today’s crypto landscape. “We need a model that respects the innovation happening in this space,” she said, “but doesn’t ignore the human, economic, and governance dynamics driving it.” That means acknowledging that technology is not neutral — it changes how assets behave. It means recognizing that markets are emotional, not mechanical. And it means treating decentralization as a moving target, not a box to tick. As for the SEC, it now faces the difficult task of turning all this feedback into actionable policy. Whether or not A16z’s framework makes it into the final picture, one thing is clear: the conversation has only just begun. “The goal isn’t just to regulate crypto,” Frei told me as we wrapped up. “It’s to do it in a way that protects people — without pretending this space is something it’s not.” And maybe, just maybe, there is a way out of here — but only if we’re honest about where we’re starting from.",Feature|Exclusive|A16Z|SEC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-31 18:58:28

This decline is in line with the broader crypto market, which has been impacted by macroeconomic uncertainties, including new tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump, adding pressure to global financial conditions. Key Market Insights and Technical Overview XRP is testing a critical resistance level at $2.15, a barrier that will determine its immediate price trajectory. A successful breakout above this mark could propel it toward the next target of $2.20 or higher. However, failure to maintain momentum above this level could trigger a retracement, with support levels found at $2.08 and $2.05. If XRP falls below $2.05, it may face further downside pressure, potentially pushing it toward $2.00. In the derivatives space, XRP has witnessed a significant 125% surge in options trading, highlighting growing investor interest and speculation. This uptick in activity could fuel a potential rally toward $2.50 , contingent on sustained buying pressure and positive sentiment. Factors Driving XRP’s Short-Term Performance Several key elements could shape XRP’s price action over the next 12 hours: Crypto Market Trends: Movements in Bitcoin and Ethereum often set the tone for XRP’s performance, making their price action crucial indicators. Regulatory Developments: Ongoing legal and regulatory matters surrounding Ripple continue to influence market sentiment and investor confidence. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Investor Sentiment: Mixed market outlooks suggest both bullish and bearish possibilities, making price swings likely. XRP remains in a consolidation phase, hovering between $2.05 and $2.15. If buyers gain control, a breakout above resistance could lead to a bullish run, while a dip below support may extend the decline. Given the volatility in the crypto space, traders should keep a close watch on market trends and key levels before making any moves.

He also remarked that he would reveal when the “real top” is in. Analyst Affirms Top Isn’t In Yet Despite The Bitcoin Price Stuggles In an X post, BitQuant was confident as he assured that the top isn’t in yet despite the Bitcoin price struggles. He noted that during the last cycle, market participants argued that $60,000 didn’t look like a top, even though it had a perfect textbook structure of one. Now, there is a panic although this top structure has yet to form in this market cycle. Related Reading: This Bear Market Indicator Says Bitcoin Price Is Headed For Crash To $40,000, Here’s When The analyst stated that he understands the bearish sentiment but that this is likely because some market participants haven’t experienced the bull phase yet. He affirmed that when the real top is in for the Bitcoin price, and there is a 25% pullback, he will post his accompanying chart again. The analyst added that market participants would know for sure, without any guidance, whether the top is in or not. Crypto analyst Kevin Capital also suggested that the top isn’t in yet for the Bitcoin price. However, he admitted that the crypto is in a major correctional phase in the market. The analyst remarked that these corrections take time and asked market participants to stay patient while monitoring the macro data and monetary policy updates. Kevin Capital mentioned that much can be done in the meantime and claimed that this is what crypto is like. He added that most of the Bitcoin price gains are accomplished in a two-week period every year. Other times, the flagship crypto simply trades sideways or witnesses significant declines. BTC Still Risks Dropping To As Low As $70,000 In a recent analysis, Kevin Capital predicted that the Bitcoin price could still drop to as low as $70,000. He stated that if BTC loses the golden pocket at $81,000 and follows through with that measured target, then the $70,000 to $73,000 range, which he has outlined on the higher time frames, would be the “Measured Move” target. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Set For Reversal To $130,000 After Forming Major Cup And Handle Support The analyst also remarked that there are lots of factors this week that will influence price action. One is Donald Trump’s tariff implementation on April 2nd, which he suggested could be a buy-the-news event in the sense that BTC has also priced into the effects of the proposed tariff and could surge once the event occurs. Kevin Capital also highlighted other macro factors, such as the labor market data at the end of the week. Meanwhile, the US Treasury run-off will decrease from $25 billion to $5 billion starting April 1st. The analyst admitted that it remains uncertain whether these events have an immediate sentiment effect or even affect the sentiment at all.

Recent shifts in global economics, particularly the looming U.S. tariffs, are sending ripples of uncertainty across the crypto market. A new survey from Bitcoin World and Cratos dives deep into the sentiment of Korean investors, a significant player in the crypto sphere, revealing some potentially concerning trends. Let’s break down what this survey uncovers and what it could mean for your crypto portfolio. Korean Investors’ Crypto Market Sentiment Shifts: Fear Grips the Market The survey, conducted between March 25th and 28th, polled 2,000 Korean cryptocurrency investors to gauge their weekly market outlook. The results paint a picture of decreasing optimism and rising anxiety. Interestingly, the number of investors expecting a surge in Bitcoin price this week has drastically fallen. Only 21.4% are hopeful for an increase or significant jump, a sharp decline from 36.8% the previous week. Conversely, the percentage of investors bracing for a downturn has nearly doubled. A significant 40.4% now anticipate a decline or even a sharp drop in Bitcoin price , a stark contrast to the 21.1% who felt this way just a week prior. Those expecting market stability have also decreased, suggesting a general unease and anticipation of volatility within the crypto market sentiment among Korean investors. Here’s a quick snapshot of the changing expectations: Expectation This Week (%) Last Week (%) Increase/Significant Jump 21.4% 36.8% Stable Market 38.2% 42.1% Decline/Sharp Drop 40.4% 21.1% This shift highlights a notable cooling in crypto market sentiment among Korean investors, suggesting a move from cautious optimism to a more defensive stance. Neutrality Wanes: Are Korean Investors Becoming More Fearful? Beyond price predictions, the survey explored the overall emotional temperature of the crypto market sentiment . A considerable 44.1% of participants positioned themselves as neutral. However, digging deeper, we see a worrying trend. Optimism, in any form, is dwindling. Only 23% expressed optimism or extreme optimism, while a concerning 32.9% indicated feelings of fear or extreme fear. This indicates a tilt away from neutrality and towards a more emotionally charged market environment, leaning towards apprehension. Let’s visualize the emotional landscape: Neutral: 44.1% Optimistic/Extremely Optimistic: 23% Fearful/Extremely Fearful: 32.9% This emotional breakdown underscores a growing sense of unease within the Korean crypto market sentiment . While a large portion remains neutral, the significant presence of fear suggests that underlying anxieties are bubbling to the surface. U.S. Tariffs: The Catalyst for Crypto Price Drop Concerns? Now, for the million-dollar question: What’s fueling this shift in sentiment? The survey directly addressed the elephant in the room – the Trump administration’s reciprocal tariffs, slated to be introduced on April 2nd. The survey asked about the potential short-term impact of these U.S. tariffs on the crypto market. The response was quite telling. A substantial 49.5% of Korean investors believe these U.S. tariffs will have a negative impact, potentially triggering crypto price drops . This is nearly half of the surveyed population, indicating a strong consensus regarding the perceived threat of these tariffs. However, not everyone is convinced of doom and gloom. A significant 33.4% hold a different perspective. They believe that the impact of these U.S. tariffs has already been factored into current market prices – a concept known as “priced in.” This group anticipates that once the initial uncertainty surrounding the tariffs dissipates, the market will likely rebound. The remaining 17.1% are seemingly unfazed, predicting that the market will largely ignore the tariffs. Here’s a breakdown of investor expectations regarding U.S. tariffs : Negative Impact/Price Drops: 49.5% Priced In/Market Rebound: 33.4% No Market Reaction: 17.1% Why Are Korean Investors So Concerned About U.S. Tariffs and Crypto Price? Why this heightened sensitivity to U.S. tariffs among Korean investors? Several factors could be at play: Global Market Interconnectedness: The cryptocurrency market is inherently global. Events in one major economy, like the U.S., can have cascading effects worldwide. Tariffs imposed by the U.S., even if not directly targeting crypto, can impact broader financial markets, investor sentiment, and risk appetite, all of which can indirectly influence crypto price . Economic Uncertainty: Tariffs often breed economic uncertainty. They can disrupt trade flows, increase costs for businesses, and potentially slow down economic growth. In times of economic uncertainty, investors tend to become risk-averse, and speculative assets like cryptocurrencies can be among the first to feel the pressure leading to potential crypto price drops . Korean Economy Sensitivity: South Korea, while a robust economy, is highly trade-dependent. Global trade tensions, especially those involving major partners like the U.S., can have a more pronounced impact on the Korean economy, making Korean investors particularly attuned to such developments and their potential to trigger crypto price drops . Past Market Behavior: The crypto market has historically reacted strongly to global economic and political events. Past instances of trade tensions or economic policy announcements have often triggered volatility in cryptocurrency prices. Korean investors, familiar with this historical volatility, might be preemptively bracing for similar reactions to these new U.S. tariffs . Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Amid Tariff Concerns So, what should crypto investors, especially those in Korea or those observing the Korean market closely, take away from this survey? Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on developments related to U.S. tariffs and their potential impact on global markets. Economic news and analysis will be crucial in navigating this period. Manage Risk: Given the increased anxiety and expectation of potential crypto price drops , consider reviewing your portfolio risk. Diversification and appropriate position sizing become even more important in uncertain times. Prepare for Volatility: Expect continued volatility in the crypto market. Trade cautiously and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that market sentiment can be cyclical. While short-term anxieties are valid, maintain a long-term perspective on your crypto investments. Focus on the fundamental value and potential of the projects you are invested in. Consider Market Rebound Potential: Note that a significant portion of Korean investors believe the tariff impact is already priced in and anticipate a market rebound. This perspective offers a glimmer of hope and suggests that any potential dips might be temporary. Conclusion: Navigating Crypto Uncertainty in the Face of Tariffs The survey of Korean cryptocurrency investors paints a clear picture: uncertainty and apprehension are on the rise. The looming U.S. tariffs are perceived as a significant risk factor, with nearly half of respondents anticipating negative impacts and potential crypto price drops . While a portion believes the market has already adjusted, the overall sentiment underscores a need for caution and informed decision-making. As the April 2nd tariff implementation date approaches, the crypto market is likely to remain sensitive to news and developments. For investors, staying informed, managing risk, and maintaining a balanced perspective will be key to navigating these potentially turbulent times. The Korean investor sentiment serves as a valuable bellwether, highlighting the interconnectedness of the global economy and its influence on the ever-dynamic cryptocurrency market.

The Japanese Bitcoin treasury company has issued 2 billion Japanese yen ($13.3 million) in zero-interest bonds to continue expanding its BTC reserves. Metaplanet Issues More Debt To Buy More BTC On March 31, Metaplanet announced the fresh issuance of 0% ordinary bonds by allocation to fuel its Bitcoin purchases following a meeting of its board of directors. The debt security will be allocated via the company’s Evo fund, allowing investors to redeem the bonds at full face value by Sept. 30. Metaplanet CEO Simon Gerovich said in an X post that his firm was taking advantage of the recent pullback in crypto prices. The announcement comes as Bitcoin traded hands for around $83,797 at publication time, down 23.2% from its January historic high of nearly $109,000. Metaplanet is currently the tenth-largest corporate holder of Bitcoin in the world, with a stockpile of 3,350 BTC. Earlier this month, the Tokyo-listed company scooped up 150 Bitcoin , chipping away at its ambitious goal of accumulating 10,000 BTC by 2025 and 21,000 BTC by 2026 . Continuing An Aggressive Bitcoin Purchase Streak Meanwhile, Metaplanet is making powerful friends in the United States. Earlier in March, the firm added Eric Trump, son of U.S. President Donald Trump, to its newly established advisory board to bolster its mission to become a “global leader in the Bitcoin economy”. The latest debt offering signals Metaplanet’s intent to double down on a treasury strategy that’s rapidly gaining popularity among public companies, from GameStop’s $1.3 billion convertible note plan to other notable players like Semler Scientific and Bitcoin mining giant MARA holdings . The strategy was popularized by Michael Saylor’s software firm Strategy (formerly known as MicroStrategy), which has turned bold Bitcoin accumulation into a corporate identity.

In a March 31 notice, Representative Maxine Waters reiterated a warning from a letter she sent to acting SEC Chair Mark Uyeda in February in response to the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency’s reported access to sensitive SEC information. DOGE is an advisory body to US President Donald Trump rather than an official department established by Congress. According to the California lawmaker, giving Musk such access would have “dire consequences” for US investors and present conflicts of interest. “[...] as a result of this takeover, the agency is at greater risk of data breaches and market disruptions, both of which could result in investors, including retirees, losing their hard-earning savings,” said Waters, adding: “Not only that, Musk, who has been the subject of repeated SEC enforcement actions for breaking securities laws and regulations, can benefit his own businesses and harm his competitors by using his access to confidential business information and his influence over the agency’s operations.” Waters’ warning followed multiple reports suggesting that Musk’s DOGE team contacted the SEC and would be given access to the commission’s systems and data. Since joining the Trump administration as a “special government employee,” Musk has spearheaded efforts to fire staff at multiple government agencies, including the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the watchdog Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Many of DOGE’s actions face lawsuits in federal court from parties alleging the group’s actions were illegal or unconstitutional. Related: Can the law keep up with Musk and DOGE? As one of the major US financial regulators, the SEC is responsible for oversight and regulation of many aspects of the cryptocurrency industry, including whether many tokens qualify as securities. Under Uyeda and US President Donald Trump, the commission has dropped several lawsuits alleging violations of securities laws against crypto firms since January. ‘Cost-cutting’ strategy at SEC? It’s unclear whether the DOGE team intends to “purge” the SEC of employees Musk considers not loyal to the Trump administration, as has been implied in some lawsuits involving firings at other government agencies. Cointelegraph contacted acting chair Uyeda and SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw for comment but did not receive a response by the time of publication. DOGE’s reported infiltration of the SEC comes as the US Senate Banking Committee is expected to vote on whether to advance the nomination of Paul Atkins, Trump’s pick to chair the agency. At his March 27 confirmation hearing, Atkins said he would “definitely” be willing to work with DOGE if confirmed. Democratic lawmakers at the hearing questioned Atkins’ potential conflicts of interest with the crypto industry.

In fact, the crypto sector as a whole could be facing a severe downtrend reminiscent of 2022. “I could see us going back to a five handle by the end of the year,” Quinn Thompson, founder of crypto hedge fund Lekker Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview. A ""five handle,"" i.e. a price between $50,000 and $59,999, would be down substantially from the already shaky current $83,000 level and roughly a 50% decline from bitcoin's peak just above $109,000 just more than two months ago. “I don't think it happens quickly, which is why it would be very painful and shocking to people because nothing about the current market conditions is very volatile, with big liquidations and crashes,” Thompson added. “It's this sort of different market environment, a slow grind down that is almost more unbearable for people because they're like, ‘Is it over? Is the bottom in?’” Thompson, who had been bearish from far higher levels, has repeatedly called the White House’s crypto announcements — be it the Sovereign Wealth Fund or Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, or anything in-between — ""nothingburgers"" and “sell the news” events. He has also argued that Strategy’s (MSTR) constant bitcoin buys aren’t necessarily bullish for the cryptocurrency, since they seem to be the only significant bid. The economy’s four headwinds Central to Thompson’s thesis is the idea that the Trump administration’s various policies will likely hurt the economy for the next six to nine months. First, the Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E), in its efforts to reduce the U.S. deficit, is bent on cutting government spending — which has been one of the largest drivers of job growth in recent years. The labour market was already wobbly when the Biden team handed over the reins to Trump, Thompson said, and the new government’s fiscal arm isn’t interested in propping things up anymore. “People get caught up in the politics of it,” Thompson said. “We can disagree on whether we need the Department of Education or not. But those dollars were being printed and going into people's pockets, and those people spent them, and went on vacation and to the grocery store. So it was growth positive.” Elon Musk, the main force behind D.O.G.E, said last week that he was aiming to cut $1 trillion in government spending by the end of May; he also said he wanted to cut 15% of the government’s annual spending, meaning almost $7 trillion. Even if D.O.G.E fails its stated objective and only manages to cut, say, a hundred billion over the course of four years, the bigger cuts are likely to occur at the beginning of Trump’s term, not the end, Thompson argued. This means that D.O.G.E’s impact on the economy and consumer sentiment is likely to be felt in the coming months, no matter whether the agency actually succeeds or not. Second, the crackdown on illegal immigration at the southern border — combined with the renewed emphasis on deportations — is bound to affect the labour market, Thompson said. Migration is growth positive because it puts pressure on wages; if that labour pool dries up, workers will demand higher salaries, which some businesses won’t be able to afford. Thompson’s third issue is tariffs. The Trump administration keeps changing up its tariff threats on a day-to-day basis, sometimes promising new ones, sometimes calling them off, creating doubt as to whether the majority of proposed tariffs will actually ever go into effect. But the important thing about tariffs is that they create uncertainty for businesses, which may elect to delay investment or hiring decisions until the tariff situation is resolved. Finally, the Federal Reserve doesn’t seem to be in a hurry to loosen financial conditions because inflation data hasn’t been great. The U.S. central bank cut interest by a full percentage point at the end of 2024, to 4.25%-4.5%, and even that wasn’t enough to push bitcoin above $110,000. Thompson says he expects the Fed to cut anywhere between 25 and 75 basis points in 2025, but that these cuts will be spread out in the second half of the year. “I think there's a lot more coordination going on between the Treasury and the Fed than people want to believe,” Thompson said. “People thought Trump and [Fed chair] Powell would be bickering, but they’re actually kind of on the same team right now. [Secretary of Treasury] Bessent and Trump are bringing growth down, and that helps Powell achieve lower inflation.” When will the bottom be? With such headwinds working against risk-on assets like stocks and bitcoin, the crypto sector is unlikely to have a good year, Thompson said. The fact that the White House doesn’t seem overly concerned about a potential recession is also a strong signal, he said. “Bessent is coming in saying, ‘We need to right the ship.’ And righting the ship means cutting off the juice that was powering these crazy asset prices. The direct result of their policies working is a lower stock market,” Thompson said. But how long is Trump likely to maintain course? Until it becomes too painful and even Trump’s political base tells him to cut it out, or until the beginning of 2026 — you can’t be pushing a country into a recession with midterm elections coming up. “I equate this to a controlled burn. They’re trying to purposefully clear the brush so that it doesn't become a bigger problem. But sometimes controlled burns become forest fires,” Thompson said. “I think it's going to be a long kind of slog through the year as they try to enact these policies.”",Markets|Bitcoin|Trump|Federal Reserve|Elon Musk,EN,0,0,BTC|DOGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-31 19:10:25

Let’s dive into the captivating world of Korean crypto trends and see which digital assets reigned supreme in search and mentions! Top Searched Crypto Tokens in the K-Community: What Caught Korea’s Eye? Curiosity drives the crypto market, and search trends often foreshadow potential price movements or growing community interest.

Here’s a rundown of the top 10 most searched tokens: Rank Token Searches 1 XRP 70,896 2 AUCTION 22,746 3 ETH 21,429 4 BTC 19,060 5 SOL 14,863 6 MOVE 14,233 7 DOGE 13,616 8 PI 12,104 9 ORCA 12,001 10 LAYER 7,609 Key Takeaways from Top Searched Crypto: XRP Dominance: Wow! XRP takes the crown by a significant margin, boasting over 70,000 searches. This could indicate strong community sentiment, potential anticipation of news, or active trading interest surrounding XRP within the Korean market. AUCTION’s Surprising Surge: AUCTION, landing in the second spot, suggests a rising interest in this token within the K-Community. Is it related to specific project developments, partnerships, or perhaps a growing understanding of its utility? Blue Chips Still in the Game: Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) maintain their positions in the top searches, proving their enduring relevance and consistent interest from Korean crypto users. They remain foundational pillars of the crypto market Korea is actively engaging with.

This marks significant progress towards the IPO’s success. Circle’s IPO Journey and Progress Circle has been working on going public for several years but has consistently faced roadblocks. Four years ago, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) derailed its plans to pursue an SPAC merger, which used to be a popular route for companies seeking the attention of public markets. The most sought-after IPO is finally becoming a reality this April. According to some sources familiar with the matter, the new partnerships with JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are focused on facilitating the IPO offering. The specific timeline has yet to be announced; however, trading is expected to commence within weeks after it is filed. Improved US Regulatory Shift May Favour Circle IPO The stablecoin issuer may need to extend this timeline if it meets a roadblock with regulators. However, the US regulatory landscape has improved since Donald Trump’s inauguration and Mark Uyeda’s appointment as interim SEC Chair. With favorable policies and regulatory frameworks, more crypto firms have seen the tides, including lawsuits with the SEC, turn in their favor. Should Circle succeed with this IPO, it would be the second in the digital asset sector after American cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, which bagged its IPO in 2021. In a plot twist, JPMorgan Chase and Citi served as advisors in the Coinbase IPO. More Crypto Firms Plans For IPO Apart from Circle, several other digital asset services in the Web3 ecosystem providers seek an IPO equally. Three weeks ago, Gemini, the company Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss founded, confidentially filed for an IPO and enlisted Goldman Sachs and Citigroup to guide the process. Similarly, Singapore-based crypto mining rig manufacturer Bgin Blockchain Limited also filed an IPO in the US . This firm plans to raise $50 million by offering 59.54 million Class A ordinary shares and 15.69 million Class B shares, with an application to list them under the ticker “BGIN” on Nasdaq. Other firms speculated to be pursuing an IPO are Kraken, Bullish, and Blockchain.com.

42711904,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144729,1743448844,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Unveiling the Transformative Alpha Quark Merger: HPP Token Set to Reshape DeFi,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/alpha-quark-merger-hpp-token/,"Get ready for a potentially seismic shift in the crypto landscape! The NFT marketplace Alpha Quark has dropped a bombshell governance proposal that could redefine its future and impact several other key players in the blockchain space. In a move that’s generating significant buzz, Alpha Quark is proposing a strategic merger to form the House Party Protocol (HPP) ecosystem. This isn’t just any merger; it’s a bold initiative to unite Alpha Quark with Aergo, W3DB (a project by VaaSBlock), and Booost under a single banner and a unified token: HPP. Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development and explore what it could mean for you. What is the Buzz About the Alpha Quark Merger and HPP Token? The core of this announcement revolves around a governance proposal posted on Alpha Quark’s official Medium blog. The proposal outlines a plan to create the House Party Protocol (HPP) through a strategic merger of four distinct projects. This isn’t just about combining forces; it’s about creating a synergistic ecosystem with a unified token economy. The key players involved in this potential Alpha Quark Merger are: Alpha Quark (AQT): An established NFT marketplace known for its focus on digital collectibles and unique user experiences. Aergo (AERGO): A public blockchain protocol designed for hybrid blockchain deployments, offering both public and private chain functionalities. W3DB: A project developed by VaaSBlock, although specific details require further clarification from official sources, it’s likely involved in data management or related blockchain infrastructure. Booost: Again, details are still emerging, but based on the context, it could be a platform or protocol that complements the functionalities of the other three, potentially in the DeFi or infrastructure space. The central piece of this merger is the introduction of the HPP Token . This unified token is proposed to consolidate the existing token economies of AQT, AERGO, W3DB, and Booost. If the proposal gets the green light, it will mean a token swap for current AQT holders. According to the announcement, the proposed swap ratio is 1 AQT for 7.43026 HPP. Why a Merger? Unpacking the Potential Benefits Mergers in the crypto world, like in traditional business, are often driven by the desire to achieve greater scale, synergy, and efficiency. What are the potential benefits of this Alpha Quark Merger to form HPP? Ecosystem Growth and Expansion: By combining the strengths of Alpha Quark, Aergo, W3DB, and Booost, the HPP ecosystem aims to become a more comprehensive and robust platform. This could lead to increased user adoption and greater network effects. Unified Token Economy with HPP Token: Consolidating multiple tokens into a single HPP Token can simplify the user experience, improve liquidity, and create a more cohesive economic model within the ecosystem. It can also streamline governance and incentivize participation across all merged platforms. Enhanced Interoperability: Aergo’s focus on hybrid blockchain solutions could provide a strong foundation for interoperability within the HPP ecosystem, potentially allowing for seamless interaction between different applications and services built on the platform. Technological Synergies: Combining the technological expertise of these four projects could lead to innovative solutions and faster development cycles. For instance, integrating W3DB’s data management capabilities with Alpha Quark’s NFT marketplace and Aergo’s blockchain infrastructure could create powerful new use cases. Stronger Market Position: A larger, more unified entity like HPP could have a stronger market presence and be better positioned to compete in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Governance Vote: Your Voice Matters Crucially, this is a governance proposal, meaning the community – specifically AQT token holders initially – will have a say in whether this Alpha Quark Merger goes ahead. The governance vote is scheduled to commence on April 2nd. This is a significant moment for the AQT community, as it will determine the future direction of the project and the value of their holdings. Here’s what you need to know about the voting process: Voting Platform: Details of the voting platform and process will likely be announced by Alpha Quark closer to April 2nd. Keep an eye on their official Medium blog and social media channels for updates. Token Holders’ Power: AQT token holders will be the ones voting on this proposal. The outcome of the vote will directly impact the future of AQT and its integration into the HPP ecosystem. Understanding the Proposal: It’s vital for AQT holders to thoroughly read and understand the full governance proposal on Alpha Quark’s Medium blog before casting their vote. Consider the potential benefits and risks before making a decision. Token Swap Details: What Happens to Your AQT? If the governance proposal passes, the next big question is: what happens to your AQT tokens? The proposal outlines a token swap mechanism. Here are the key details regarding the AQT to HPP Token swap: Swap Ratio: The proposed swap ratio is 1 AQT = 7.43026 HPP. This ratio is crucial for understanding the potential value of your AQT holdings post-merger. Swap Mechanism: The exact mechanism for the token swap will be detailed if the proposal is approved. It’s likely to involve a process where AQT holders can exchange their tokens for HPP tokens through a designated platform or smart contract. Timeline: The timeline for the token swap will also be announced post-governance vote approval. It’s important to stay informed about these timelines to ensure a smooth transition. Potential Value Implications: Token swaps can be complex and impact token value in various ways. Factors such as the perceived value of the HPP ecosystem, the demand for the HPP Token , and overall market conditions will influence the post-swap value of your holdings. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the proposed Alpha Quark Merger and the creation of the HPP ecosystem present exciting opportunities, it’s also important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Integration Complexity: Merging multiple projects, especially those with different technologies and communities, can be complex. Successful integration will require careful planning and execution. Community Alignment: Ensuring alignment and buy-in from the communities of all four projects is crucial. Clear communication and addressing concerns from each community will be vital for a smooth transition. Execution Risks: As with any ambitious project, there are execution risks involved in implementing the merger and building the HPP ecosystem. Delays, technical challenges, or unforeseen market events could impact the success of the initiative. Information Gaps: Currently, information about W3DB and Booost is limited. More clarity on these projects and their roles within the HPP ecosystem is needed for a complete understanding of the merger’s potential. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. External market factors could influence the success of the merger and the value of the HPP Token . Actionable Insights: Staying Informed and Prepared For those interested in Alpha Quark, Aergo, or the broader implications of this merger, here are some actionable steps you can take: Read the Full Proposal: Head over to Alpha Quark’s official Medium blog and read the complete governance proposal. This is the best way to get a comprehensive understanding of the plan. Follow Official Channels: Stay updated by following Alpha Quark’s official Twitter, Telegram, and Medium channels for announcements and updates regarding the governance vote and the merger. DYOR (Do Your Own Research): Research Aergo, W3DB, and Booost to gain a better understanding of the projects involved in the merger. Look for official websites, whitepapers, and community discussions. Participate in Community Discussions: Engage in discussions within the Alpha Quark community and other relevant crypto communities to share your thoughts and learn from others. Prepare for the Governance Vote: If you are an AQT holder, prepare to participate in the governance vote starting April 2nd. Make an informed decision based on your understanding of the proposal and your investment goals. Conclusion: A Bold Move with Potential The proposed Alpha Quark Merger to form the House Party Protocol and introduce the HPP Token is undoubtedly a bold and potentially transformative move in the crypto space. It represents a significant step towards ecosystem consolidation and highlights the ongoing evolution of blockchain projects. While challenges and uncertainties remain, the potential synergies and benefits of uniting these four projects are undeniable. As the governance vote approaches, the crypto community will be watching closely to see if this ambitious vision becomes a reality. Keep your eyes peeled for updates and prepare to witness the next chapter in the Alpha Quark story, potentially as part of the exciting new HPP ecosystem.

The data revealed that the crypto whale in question transferred 427.79 million Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) tokens worth $2.48 million to Binance and OKX, losing $2.55 million in the process. In other words, this crypto whale lost more than 50% of his PENGU investment.

Onchain data shows that the crypto whale that made these transactions currently has around $1,500 in assets in his wallet. On the other hand, another large crypto wallet that funds this wallet (probably the same whale) has a portfolio worth $8 million.

The ultimate wallet guide for 2025,https://crypto.news/what-are-crypto-wallets/,"Crypto wallets enable you to send and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum by keeping your private keys, which are the passwords that grant you access to your funds, safe and easily accessible. Table of Contents What is a crypto wallet? Types of crypto wallets: Hot wallets vs cold wallets What is the best crypto wallet? What is the best crypto mobile wallet? Conclusion: Choosing the right crypto wallet for your needs Technically, a crypto wallet does not keep your cryptocurrency, in contrast to a regular wallet that can hold real cash. Although your holdings are live on the blockchain, only a private key can be used to access them. Your keys let you conduct transactions and serve as proof that you are the owner of your digital currency. In this article we will learn what a cryptocurrency wallet is, the difference between hot wallets vs cold wallets, and dive into some of the best crypto wallet apps out there. What is a crypto wallet? An application that serves as a wallet for your cryptocurrency is called a crypto wallet. Because it functions similarly to a wallet in which you store cash and credit cards, it is called a wallet. It provides the interface that enables you to access your cryptocurrency and stores the passkeys you use to sign for transactions, in place of these tangible objects. Everyone can access the blockchain thanks to contemporary blockchain wallets. Sending cryptocurrency was a laborious process that required entering lengthy keys when it was initially released. Nowadays, most of it is done for you by the software. Satoshi Nakamoto, the creator of Bitcoin ( BTC ), had the first wallet. Hal Finney, who supposedly ran the BTC client software wallet initially and corresponded with Nakamoto, owned the second wallet. The cryptocurrency frenzy started when Nakamoto sent him ten BTC as a test. Almost all crypto wallets have their dedicated cryptocurrency wallet app which users can use to store and withdraw crypto from online crypto exchanges. Now that we know what cryptocurrency wallets are, let’s dive into the key difference between a cold crypto wallet and a hot wallet. You might also like: The ultimate guide to the best crypto wallets for every trader Types of crypto wallets: Hot wallets vs cold wallets Hot and cold wallets are the two primary varieties of cryptocurrency wallets. Let’s discuss them one by one. What is a hot wallet? A third party hosts hot wallets, also known as online or custodial wallets, and keeps your keys on their behalf. These types of wallets might offer enterprise-level data security solutions that companies utilize to protect and preserve their data. Customers of certain crypto exchanges can access hot wallets. Applications for PCs and mobile devices are included in hot wallets. These wallets can access your cryptocurrency, conduct transactions, show your balance, and do a lot more. They can be installed on a desktop or laptop computer. If you’re using a wallet created by a cryptocurrency exchange, some software wallets can come with extra features like exchange integration. What is a cold wallet? Cold wallets or non-custodial wallets are ones where you are in charge of keeping your keys safe. The majority of crypto hardware wallets are cold wallets and considered a safer option than online wallets for obvious reasons. Since you can store and retrieve your private keys from your device, crypto cold wallets are the most widely used kind of wallet. These gadgets may seem like USB drives, and contemporary hardware wallets come with a number of functionalities. By connecting the hardware wallets for crypto to your computer or smartphone, you can conduct cryptocurrency transactions. The majority of them have the capacity to instantly sign cryptocurrency transactions without you having to enter the key, preventing hackers from recording your screen or logging your keystrokes. Now that we have identified the key differences between hot and cold wallets, let’s answer the most important question: what are the best wallets for cryptocurrency? What is the best crypto wallet? Since the inception of crypto wallets, hundreds of wallets have flooded the market and it can be difficult to identify the right one. We make it easy for you and here we list the top five cryptocurrency hardware wallets. 1. Trezor Trezor Safe 5 | Source: Trezor Trezor is a leader in hardware wallets, including devices such the Model One and Safe 5. These gadgets are well-liked by cryptocurrency aficionados because of their security, intuitive UI, and compatibility for a wide range of coins. Trezor lacks native staking and NFT administration, but it does include a touch screen for completely on-device entry and extremely safe offline storage. Additionally, it lacks a Bluetooth connection. Some of the best hardware for crypto storing is offered from Trezor. The Tezor Model One, its entry-level model, costs about $49, but it also offers a more costly variant with a touch screen (it cost $169 at the last update). Trezor offers built-in services like staking and cryptocurrency purchases through its software packages, but it also integrates with other cryptocurrency companies like Exodus. It offers both a desktop version and a mobile app (Trezor Suite Lite) for Android and Apple. You might also like: Trezor Safe devices still vulnerable to physical supply chain attacks, Ledger says 2. Exodus Exodus app + Trezor wallet | Source: Exodus Since its 2016 launch, Exodus , a non-custodial wallet that accepts several cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, has created a lot of excitement. It is a beautifully designed wallet that is full of features, including the ability to exchange cryptocurrencies within the wallet and the opportunity to stake assets directly within the wallet to generate passive income. Thousands of assets are supported by the Exodus wallet, and users can exchange over 100 supported digital currencies with their rapid exchange integration function, which keeps the coins safe and secure inside their own wallet. As a response to user requests for two-factor authentication and enhanced security, Exodus has partnered with and integrated with the Trezor hardware wallet, offering users the convenience, functionality, and user interface of the Exodus software wallet with the security and peace of mind of a hardware wallet. The Exodus wallet itself is accessible with a secure password, which should be adequate for the majority of users. 3. Ledger Ledger Nanox | Source: Ledger One of the most well-known brands in cryptocurrency wallets is Ledger . Ledger can interact with several well-known software wallets, including Crypto.com and Guarda, and its costs range from around $79 to $249. Ledger offers a separate desktop client, a browser plugin, and a well-reviewed mobile app. Additionally, Ledger offers two-factor authentication and a user education library. Over 5,500 assets can be supported by both Ledger wallet versions. They also give users access to decentralized finance programs, or dapps; however, non-fungible token, or NFT, management is no longer supported by the Nano Ledger S. With Ledger’s integrated desktop and mobile apps, you can buy, stake and swap currencies. Ledger Live software is open source, but the device firmware is not, and Ledger devices provide multisignature security with Coinkite integration and two-factor authentication. 4. SafePal S1 Hardware Wallet | Source: SafePal Established in 2018, SafePal provides both novices and seasoned cryptocurrency experts with a full range of safe crypto management solutions. Additionally, Binance Labs, Binance’s startup capital division, made its first hardware wallet investment with its S1 wallet. With its distinctive hardware wallets, software wallets, and browser extension wallet product lines, SafePal currently provides services to over seven million consumers worldwide. The SafePal app is used to pair and manage these, allowing users to conveniently store, manage, trade, and swap their assets. SafePal supports more than 100 blockchains (EVM and non-EVM) and 16 languages as of this writing, with more being added all the time. SafePal’s long-term goal is to enable investors to pursue financial independence and opportunity in the decentralized world. The S1 hardware wallet is going for $49.99 which is a decent price for a crypto hardware wallet with a digital interface and an acceptable amount of features as well. 5. KeepKey KeepKey hardware wallet | Source: KeepKey Since ShapeShift purchased KeepKey in 2017, its most popular product has been an offline wallet that helps keep your cryptocurrency safe from hackers. But KeepKey became an independent entity after ShapeShift became a DAO. ShapeShift and KeepKey, one of the numerous dApps that may be linked to the wallet, are still cooperating, though. Because KeepKey’s code is open-source, anyone may examine how the application is constructed, ensuring user safety and fostering confidence. Speaking about the wallet itself, K eepKey has significantly reduced its pricing when it was selling for $239 and now when it costs around $50, at the time of writing. What is the best crypto mobile wallet? While hardware wallets may be a safer option, they aren’t the most accessible, as most of them don’t have an online user-friendly interface. This is where hot wallets come to save the day, as all of them have an easy-to-use application which anyone can use to store and withdraw cryptocurrencies through their phone. Let’s dive right into some of the best ones. 1. Coinbase Wallet Coinbase mobile app | Source: Coinbase Coinbase, a well-known cryptocurrency exchange with headquarters in the US, created Coinbase Wallet, a self-custody cryptocurrency wallet. Coinbase Wallet offers consumers exclusive control over their funds and private keys, in contrast to the custodial wallets offered by exchanges. This decentralized wallet is intended for managing NFTs (non-fungible tokens), storing cryptocurrency, and communicating with decentralized apps (dApps). Numerous cryptocurrencies are supported by Coinbase Wallet, including well-known choices like BTC, Ethereum ( ETH ), Litecoin, and ERC-20 tokens. Additionally, it enables users to store NFTs on blockchains like Polygon and ETH. Users may transfer, receive, and manage cryptocurrency assets with ease because of the wallet’s user-friendly interface. Beginners are drawn to the simple interface, and more seasoned users are pleased by its powerful capabilities. Since the wallet employs non-custodial technology, the private keys are solely accessible by the user. These keys are kept locally on your device and are encrypted. Coinbase Wallet offers biometric verification, such fingerprint or face recognition, for further security, making it harder for unauthorized users to access your money. A 12-word recovery phrase is provided by Coinbase Wallet and has to be kept safe. In the event that your gadget is lost or hacked, this phrase is crucial to getting your wallet back. 2. Metamask Metamask mobile application | Source: consensys Popular and well-known, MetaMask is a browser extension that links to the Ethereum blockchain and serves as a cryptocurrency wallet. Without downloading the complete blockchain on their device, users can engage with the Ethereum ecosystem—which is home to an extensive collection of decentralized applications (Dapps)—by using MetaMask. As a result, it’s among the greatest Ethereum wallet options for convenient access to gaming platforms, gambling websites, decentralized exchanges (DEX), and numerous other apps. The most popular browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Microsoft Edge, are compatible with the wallet. In addition to ETH, the native currency of Ethereum, MetaMask also stores tokens based on the ERC-20 and ERC-721 specifications of the protocol. 3. Trust Wallet Trust Wallet mobile application | Source: Trust wallet For mobile users, Trust Wallet is a safe and open-source cryptocurrency wallet. It was purchased by Binance in 2018 and supports a wide range of blockchain networks and currencies, mostly based on Ethereum and other chains that are compatible with EVM. The wallet makes it easy for both new and experienced cryptocurrency users to transmit, receive, store, and stake their holdings. Trust Wallet provides high-security guarantees since private keys are kept locally rather than on a server. Its straightforward layout allows novices to use it, while professionals can access its more sophisticated capabilities. A single wallet can be used to manage a wide variety of tokens. The downsides include the lack of desktop interface, as users who prefer desktop interfaces will find it less accessible because it is a wallet designed primarily for mobile devices. Also, Trust Wallet, like the majority of mobile wallets, needs an online connection in order to conduct transactions as it’s not a hard wallet as discussed before in this article. 4. Phantom Wallet Phantom Android app | Source: Phantom Phantom is a browser plugin and non-custodial wallet that can connect with digital apps and smart contracts as well as manage digital assets. Non-custodial means that you retain possession of a few pieces of confidential information, rather than having your assets in a central repository. Similar to how you must protect your physical wallet or purse from pickpockets when you’re out and about, you are responsible for keeping the assets in your Phantom wallet safe, unlike when you keep your nation’s currency in a bank account. Avoid asking for assistance with your Phantom Wallet on open-source programs like X, as some users will pose as members of the wallet’s support staff and try to con you. For answers to your questions, consult Phantom’s own documentation and help files . If you still require assistance, visit their website for support. Keep in mind that no one from Phantom will ever request your private keys or seed phrase! 5. Zengo Wallet Zengo wallet app | Source: Zengo Multi-party computation (MPC) technology is used by the self-custodial Zengo wallet to protect user accounts. Since its launch in 2019, it has never been compromised and is built to be safe by default, protecting the assets of more than a million users. Face recognition, threshold key signatures, and three-factor authentication are some of Zengo’s security features. In addition to offering a recovery mechanism that eliminates the possibility of a single point of failure, the wallet’s MPC technology guarantees that the user’s funds are nearly impossible to hack. Perhaps best of all, the Zengo wallet is totally free and accessible on both iOS and Android! Although they do have a subscription service called Zengo Pro, most users will find Zengo Essentials, which is free, to be more than enough. In addition to tokens and NFTs on the ETH and Polygon ( POL ) networks, the Zengo wallet supports more than 1,000 assets, including majors like BTC, ETH, BNB, Dogecoin, Tezos, and stablecoins. Zengo may be used to purchase, sell, and exchange assets right from within the wallet in addition to being a good option for asset storage.

Trezor, for example, is considered one of the best crypto wallets for cold storage, providing offline protection of your private keys. On the other hand, Exodus wallet combines functionality with user-friendliness, allowing you to manage multiple cryptocurrencies with ease, and even stake assets for passive income. For those looking to explore the world of decentralized finance, a DeFi wallet such as Zengo wallet offers robust security features, including face recognition and MPC technology, ensuring your funds are safe.

Manus AI , the China-based AI agent platform that took the internet by storm, has just announced the launch of its subscription plans and a dedicated mobile app . But is this move towards premium access a game-changer, or just another paywall? Let’s dive into what Manus AI is offering, and whether it lives up to the hype, especially for those in the crypto and tech-savvy community. What is Manus AI and Why Should You Care? For those unfamiliar, Manus AI is an AI agent platform designed to be your digital assistant on steroids. Imagine having an AI that can handle a wide range of tasks, from the mundane to the moderately complex. Need a website for your crypto project’s upcoming event? Manus AI claims it can do that. Want to automate your social media content schedule for your latest NFT drop? Manus AI aims to streamline those workflows. Manus AI’s appeal lies in its promise of agentic capabilities. But what does ‘agentic’ really mean in this context? Autonomous Task Execution: Unlike chatbots that simply respond to prompts, Manus AI is designed to independently carry out tasks from start to finish. Proactive Problem Solving: The platform aims to anticipate user needs and proactively offer solutions, rather than just reacting to commands. Learning and Adaptation: Manus AI is built to learn from interactions and improve its performance over time, becoming a more efficient and personalized tool. However, it’s crucial to remember that Manus AI is still in beta. While the marketing promises are bold, real-world performance is what truly matters. Our initial tests revealed that while impressive in some areas, the platform hasn’t fully delivered on all its ambitious claims. But with the introduction of subscription plans and a mobile app , is Manus AI taking a step closer to fulfilling its potential? Manus AI Subscription Plans: Premium Access or Premium Price Tag? Let’s talk about the money. Manus AI is moving beyond its free beta phase and introducing two subscription plans . Here’s a breakdown of what you get for your crypto (or fiat): Plan Price Credits Simultaneous Tasks Additional Perks Basic Premium $39/month 3,900 2 – Advanced Premium $199/month 19,900 5 Priority access during peak hours Both subscription plans operate on a credit system. Credits are essentially the currency within Manus AI , used to fuel your AI agent tasks. Need more credits? Top-up packs are available, though pricing details are still under wraps. For power users, the Advanced Premium plan offers a significant credit boost and the ability to run more tasks concurrently, which could be beneficial for complex projects or agencies managing multiple clients. Are These Plans Worth It? The value proposition of these subscription plans hinges on how effectively Manus AI can streamline your workflows and save you time. For crypto entrepreneurs, marketers, and developers constantly juggling multiple projects, a truly efficient AI agent platform could be a valuable asset. However, the $39 and $199 monthly price points are not insignificant, especially in the volatile crypto market. Users will need to carefully assess their needs and usage to determine if the ROI justifies the cost. Manus AI Goes Mobile: AI Agents in Your Pocket Alongside the subscription plans , Manus AI has launched its first mobile app for iOS devices. This is a significant step towards making AI agent platform accessible on the go. Imagine managing your AI tasks, checking on progress, or even initiating new projects directly from your smartphone. The mobile app promises to bring a new level of convenience and flexibility to Manus AI users. While an Android app is likely in the pipeline, the initial iOS launch caters to a significant portion of the mobile market. What Can You Do With the Mobile App? While specific details about the mobile app ‘s functionality are still emerging, we can expect core features like: Task Management: Monitor the status of running tasks, review completed tasks, and manage your task queue. Project Initiation: Start new AI agent tasks directly from your mobile app , whether it’s generating content, analyzing data, or automating social media posts. Account Management: Check your credit balance, manage your subscription plans , and access account settings. Notifications: Receive real-time updates on task progress, platform announcements, and important account information. The mobile app is a crucial move for Manus AI , aligning with the increasing demand for mobile-first solutions in the tech world. For crypto traders and enthusiasts who are constantly monitoring markets and managing digital assets on their phones, a mobile app for their AI agent platform is a welcome addition.

Faster Processing: Claude 3.7 Sonnet is designed for speed and efficiency, potentially leading to quicker task completion times. Enhanced Creativity: For tasks involving content generation or creative problem-solving, Claude 3.7 Sonnet ‘s advanced language model could unlock new possibilities. Better Code Generation: If you’re using Manus AI for coding-related tasks, Claude 3.7 Sonnet ‘s improved coding abilities could be a significant advantage. The move to Claude 3.7 Sonnet signals Manus AI ‘s intention to stay at the forefront of AI agent platform technology, continuously enhancing its capabilities and user experience. Challenges and the Road Ahead Despite these exciting developments, Manus AI is still navigating the challenges of scaling and meeting user demand. As stated in their recent X post, they are temporarily limiting access to manage infrastructure growth and optimize usage rates. This suggests that while the platform is rapidly evolving, it’s still working through growing pains. Potential users should be aware of possible access limitations during peak hours, especially in the initial rollout of the subscription plans and mobile app . Final Thoughts: Is Manus AI Premium Worth the Investment? Manus AI ‘s launch of subscription plans , a mobile app , and the Claude 3.7 Sonnet upgrade mark a significant evolution for this AI agent platform . The move to premium access signals a shift towards a sustainable business model and a commitment to providing enhanced features and performance. For crypto professionals and tech enthusiasts seeking to leverage AI for automation and efficiency, Manus AI presents an intriguing option. However, potential subscribers should carefully weigh the cost against their anticipated usage and needs, especially considering the platform is still in beta and working through scaling challenges.

To read full editions, subscribe . In a fitting end to a rocky first quarter, US stocks fell back into correction territory Monday. The S&P 500 was trading 0.2% lower at 2 pm ET, putting it around 4.8% in the red since the start of 2025. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is slated to close out Q1 almost 12% lower. It’s the worst first quarter performance for the Nasdaq Composite since 2020. One silver lining in Q1: gold. The precious metal is about to notch its best-performing quarter since 1986. Analysts attribute the rally to the Trump tariff-induced trade war. (More on that later.) Digital gold, though, is a different story. Bitcoin is slated to close out its worst Q1 since 2018. The narrative of bitcoin as a safe-haven asset , apparently, has not taken. Looking ahead, things could get worse before they get better. Tariffs are set to remain a dominant market narrative in Q2. President Trump is slated to announce his global tariff plans on Wednesday, which he’s dubbed “Liberation Day.” To Team Trump, April 2 will mark a turning point for domestic manufacturing. To some analysts, “Liberation Day” could also bring salvation to US equity prices (at least in the short term). The logic goes: If Trump announces a comprehensive reciprocal tariff regime, investors will gain clarity. Hopefully the daily headlines will slow down and markets can stop wondering whether a levy will be delayed or amended. Concrete answers on the tariff front would leave investors free to focus on impacts of other Trump administration economic policies, like tax cuts. In the long term, I’m less optimistic. Even Trump’s closest Cabinet members reportedly aren’t fully up-to-speed on what the president will say on Wednesday, so I’d imagine markets will also be shocked. If the announcements lead to a significant escalation in the trade war, any “clarity” bump will quickly be reversed. I’d also argue that these reciprocal tariffs are not priced-in, so expect some short-term volatility later in the week as investors digest the announcements from the White House.

Within just ten days of its launch on March 20, 2025, PumpSwap processed over $10 billion in cumulative trading volume, according to data from Dune Analytics. On March 30, it achieved a remarkable $2.43 billion in trading volume, capturing 67.4% of the total volume processed by major Solana DEXs, significantly outpacing Raydium, which accounted for 18.2%. The rapid growth of PumpSwap reflects a shift in the Solana DEX landscape, as it has become the largest fee generator on the platform. The exchange has also attracted a substantial user base, boasting approximately 700,000 active wallets and facilitating over 30 million swaps in its first ten days.

With an explosive 8,000% increase in burn rate and renewed momentum from the community, SHIB is once again making headlines — and many analysts believe it could be on the verge of a significant breakout. But as always in crypto, timing is everything — and while SHIB shows strength, another emerging project might be positioning itself for even bigger gains in 2025. Let’s break it down. Shiba Inu Burn Rate Surges as Bullish Momentum Builds After a turbulent period, SHIB has begun showing early signs of a potential rally. The meme coin has gained over 14% in the past week and recently saw its burn rate spike more than 8,000%, thanks to a single transaction that burned over 1 billion SHIB tokens. This sudden surge in token burns has reignited speculation around SHIB’s long-term potential. Technical analysts such as CryptoELITES have highlighted the formation of a classic cup-and-handle pattern, which could send SHIB to a 12x target at $0.0001833 — well above its current range around $0.000014. In addition, other analysts like Javon Marks and Oscar Ramos have pointed to realistic mid-term targets between $0.0000728 and $0.00017, citing strong demand and favorable macro sentiment. Even the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s lead marketer, Lucie, recently echoed these views, confirming the team’s long-term belief in SHIB reaching $0.01, though likely over a longer timeframe. The rise in trading volume (which recently topped $220M in 24h) and increased wallet activity also suggest SHIB might be nearing a breakout zone, especially if it manages to flip $0.000015 into solid support. Community Growth and Ecosystem Expansion Beyond price action, SHIB’s strength lies in its community. With over 1.5 million members in the Shib Army, the meme coin continues to dominate social media and community-driven narratives. The launch of Shibarium, a Layer-2 solution aimed at reducing transaction costs and scaling the network, adds further credibility to SHIB’s transition from meme to utility. The broader Shiba ecosystem — including BONE and LEASH — is also seeing renewed attention, helping to strengthen SHIB’s long-term outlook. Still, while the upside for SHIB could be significant in the next bull cycle, its multi-billion-dollar market cap means that outsized returns, like 100x, are unlikely from here. Which is why some analysts are also turning their attention to lower-cap, early-stage projects that combine traction, innovation, and price accessibility. The Last Dwarfs ($TLD): A Sub-$1 Crypto Redefining Web3 Investing Among the new generation of altcoins gaining momentum, The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) is quickly emerging as a standout. This Web3 ecosystem introduces the concept of Play-to-Invest, a model that transforms investing into a gamified, interactive experience. At the core of the platform is the Gamified Launchpad, where players can mine resources, level up characters, stake tokens, and unlock early access to high-potential crypto projects, all while playing inside a fantasy-themed game that runs directly on Telegram. This eliminates the typical barriers of crypto investing, no complicated exchanges, no wallets to set up, just seamless onboarding into a growing DeFi ecosystem, where gameplay equals progress. Unlike most presale tokens, TLD already has a live platform with over 300,000 users, and deep integration with Telegram and the TON blockchain, giving it access to an ecosystem of 900M+ users. This positions TLD for rapid growth and makes it one of the few presale projects with actual early traction. Currently in Stage 2 of its presale, $TLD is priced at $0.0085, after Stage 1 sold out completely. Early investors can also benefit from: Up to 300% APY in staking rewards A 15% Ref2Earn bonus for referrals A recently launched 1 Million $TLD Giveaway rewarding early supporters The combination of real utility, gamified mechanics, and an already active user base makes TLD one of the most promising low-cap crypto assets entering the 2025 cycle. Final Thoughts – SHIB Still Has Room to Run, But $TLD Might Offer More Upside Shiba Inu has proven time and again that community strength and meme power shouldn’t be underestimated. With bullish technical setups, massive burn rates, and an expanding ecosystem, SHIB may very well ignite another rally in 2025. However, for investors looking for the next 100x opportunity, the path may lie in early-stage projects with strong fundamentals, low entry prices, and scalable ecosystems. The Last Dwarfs ($TLD) checks all the boxes, live product, mass adoption potential, gamified utility, and strong demand even before launch. With Stage 2 of the TLD presale moving quickly, this may be one of the last chances to secure an allocation before it hits centralized exchanges.

Bybit, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, has just announced the launch of its brand new GUN/USDT perpetual contract . This addition opens up fresh opportunities for traders looking to engage with digital assets and amplify their trading strategies with up to 25x leverage. Let’s dive into what this means for you and how you can potentially benefit from this new offering on Bybit . What’s New? Bybit Launches GUN/USDT Perpetual Contract In a move that is sure to excite the crypto community, Bybit has officially listed the GUN/USDT perpetual contract. This announcement, made on their official website, signifies Bybit’s commitment to expanding its range of trading instruments and catering to the diverse needs of its global user base. But what exactly does this mean for traders, and why should you pay attention? Here’s a quick rundown of the key highlights: New Trading Pair: GUN/USDT perpetual contract is now available on Bybit. Up to 25x Leverage: Traders can access leverage of up to 25 times their initial margin. Perpetual Contract: Unlike traditional futures, this contract has no expiry date, allowing for continuous trading. Increased Opportunities: Opens doors for traders to speculate on the price of GUN against USDT with leverage. This launch is particularly noteworthy as it adds another altcoin to Bybit’s growing list of perpetual contracts. As the cryptocurrency trading landscape evolves, exchanges like Bybit are constantly seeking to provide traders with more options and tools to navigate the market. Understanding Perpetual Contracts: A Quick Primer For those new to the world of crypto derivatives, understanding what a perpetual contract is crucial. Unlike traditional futures contracts that have an expiry date, a perpetual contract , as the name suggests, has no expiration. It mimics a spot market but with the added benefit of leverage. This makes it a popular tool for traders looking to hold positions for varying lengths of time without the hassle of contract rollovers. Key features of perpetual contracts include: No Expiration Date: Trade indefinitely without worrying about contract expiry. Mark Price: Uses a ‘Mark Price’ system to prevent unnecessary liquidations due to market manipulation or thin order books. Funding Rate: A periodic payment either to or from traders based on the difference between the perpetual contract market and the spot market. This mechanism helps to keep the perpetual contract price anchored to the spot price. Leverage: Allows traders to control larger positions with a smaller amount of capital. The introduction of the GUN/USDT perpetual contract means traders can now apply these features to speculate on the price movements of GUN token against USDT, all within the robust and user-friendly environment of Bybit . What is GUN Token? Exploring the Underlying Asset Now that we know about the new contract, let’s understand the underlying asset: GUN token. While the announcement focuses on the trading instrument, it’s important to have some context about what GUN token represents. Understanding the asset you’re trading is crucial for informed cryptocurrency trading decisions. Unfortunately, the provided content doesn’t give details about GUN token itself. To make an informed trading decision, you would typically research: Project Goals: What problem does the GUN token project aim to solve? What is its utility? Tokenomics: What is the total supply, distribution, and token utility? Market Cap and Volume: How liquid is the token? What is its market capitalization? Community and Development: Is there an active community and development team behind the project? Whitepaper and Roadmap: Review the project’s whitepaper and roadmap for future plans. Before trading the GUN/USDT perpetual contract, it’s highly recommended to conduct thorough research on GUN token to understand its fundamentals and potential risks. Remember, informed trading is responsible trading. Leverage Trading Explained: Amplifying Opportunities (and Risks) The headline feature of this announcement is the 25x leverage offered on the GUN/USDT perpetual contract. Leverage trading can be a powerful tool, but it’s essential to understand how it works and the associated risks. What is Leverage? Leverage allows you to control a larger position in the market with a smaller amount of your own capital. In the case of 25x leverage, for every $1 of your capital, you can control $25 worth of GUN/USDT. This can amplify both your potential profits and losses. Benefits of Leverage: Magnified Profits: If the price of GUN moves in your favor, your profits are multiplied by the leverage ratio. Capital Efficiency: You can control larger positions without tying up a significant amount of capital. Diversification Opportunities: Leverage can free up capital for other trading opportunities. Risks of Leverage: Magnified Losses: Just as profits are amplified, so are losses. A small adverse price movement can lead to significant losses, potentially exceeding your initial margin. Liquidation Risk: If the market moves against your position and your margin balance falls below the maintenance margin level, your position may be liquidated, resulting in the loss of your initial margin. Increased Volatility Impact: Volatile assets like cryptocurrencies can experience rapid price swings, which can be particularly risky when using high leverage. Example of 25x Leverage: Let’s say you have $100 and you use 25x leverage to trade GUN/USDT. Position Size: You control a position worth $2500 (25 x $100). Scenario 1 (Profit): If GUN/USDT price increases by 1%, your profit would be $25 (1% of $2500), which is a 25% return on your initial $100 capital. Scenario 2 (Loss): If GUN/USDT price decreases by 1%, your loss would be $25 (1% of $2500), which is a 25% loss on your initial $100 capital. As you can see, leverage trading can significantly amplify both gains and losses. It’s crucial to use leverage responsibly and implement robust risk management strategies.

Navigating the Risks: Essential Considerations for Trading GUN/USDT While the potential rewards of trading the GUN/USDT perpetual contract with leverage are enticing, it’s imperative to be fully aware of the risks involved. Responsible cryptocurrency trading always starts with understanding and managing risk. Key Risks to Consider: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is inherently volatile. GUN token, like many altcoins, can experience significant price fluctuations, increasing the risk of liquidation, especially when using leverage. Liquidation Risk (High Leverage): Trading with 25x leverage significantly increases the risk of liquidation. Even small adverse price movements can trigger liquidation if risk management is not properly implemented. GUN Token Specific Risks: As an altcoin, GUN token may have lower liquidity and be more susceptible to market manipulation compared to more established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Thorough research on GUN token is crucial. Funding Rate Fluctuations: While the funding rate mechanism aims to keep the perpetual contract price aligned with the spot price, fluctuations in funding rates can impact your profitability, especially for longer-term positions. Complexity of Derivatives: Trading perpetual contracts and using leverage requires a good understanding of these instruments and their mechanics. It’s not recommended for novice traders without proper education. Risk Management Strategies: Start with Lower Leverage: If you are new to leverage trading, consider starting with lower leverage ratios and gradually increase as you gain experience and confidence. Use Stop-Loss Orders: Always use stop-loss orders to limit potential losses. Determine a comfortable risk level and set stop-loss orders accordingly. Manage Your Position Size: Do not risk a significant portion of your capital on a single trade. Proper position sizing is crucial for managing risk. Educate Yourself: Continuously learn about cryptocurrency trading , technical analysis, risk management, and the specific characteristics of GUN token and perpetual contracts. Trade with Capital You Can Afford to Lose: Never trade with funds you cannot afford to lose. Cryptocurrency trading, especially with leverage, involves significant risk of capital loss. Actionable Insights: Getting Started with GUN/USDT Perpetual Contract Ready to explore the new GUN/USDT perpetual contract on Bybit ? Here are some actionable insights to help you get started: Research GUN Token: Before trading, conduct thorough research on GUN token. Understand its fundamentals, use cases, and market dynamics. Understand Perpetual Contracts and Leverage: Ensure you have a solid understanding of how perpetual contracts and leverage work. Practice with smaller positions or paper trading if you are new. Develop a Trading Strategy: Don’t trade impulsively. Develop a clear trading strategy that includes entry and exit points, risk management rules, and position sizing. Start Small: Begin with small positions, especially when using leverage. Gradually increase your position size as you gain experience and confidence. Monitor Your Trades: Keep a close eye on your open positions. Cryptocurrency markets can move quickly, and active monitoring is essential. Utilize Bybit’s Resources: Explore Bybit’s educational resources, trading tools, and customer support to enhance your trading experience.

Conclusion: Embrace New Opportunities in Crypto Derivatives Bybit’s addition of the GUN/USDT perpetual contract with up to 25x leverage marks another step forward in the evolution of cryptocurrency trading . It provides traders with increased opportunities to engage with digital assets and utilize sophisticated trading instruments to potentially enhance their portfolio performance. However, it is crucial to remember that with increased opportunity comes increased risk.

The analyst said that these entities are resilient to market volatility and show accumulation behavior, mirroring patterns of the 2020 bull cycle. Bitcoin whale accumulation analysis.

These periods were riddled with bearish market sentiment and preceded substantial price surges, suggesting that whales were positioning themselves ahead of the recovery. While BTC currently exhibited a price decline, the analyst said, “There are no signs yet that the market-leading whales are exiting.” As shown in the chart above, “Pattern No. 3” witnessed a similar rate of accumulation, but BTC price remained sideways.

On the contrary, prolonged consolidation under $84,000 strengthens its resistance characteristics, which might eventually lead to further corrections to downside liquidity areas in the $78,200 to $76,560 zone.

Recent developments involving China, Japan, and South Korea may further contribute to market uncertainty. The three countries have agreed to respond jointly to the tariffs, raising questions about how global trade tensions will affect the crypto market. With President Trump’s planned “Liberation Day” tariffs on the horizon, questions loom over the future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. U.S. Tariffs and Global Trade Tensions China, Japan, and South Korea have reportedly confirmed that they would cooperate in addressing the U.S. tariffs, which are set to be introduced in early April. The tariffs target multiple industries, including the automotive and pharmaceutical sectors. This move comes on the back of US threats to impose additional tariffs which President Donald Trump has termed as ‘Liberation Day,’ set to happen on April 2, Wednesday. Moreover, these three nations America’s important trading partners, and these tariffs can affect the stability of their economic sectors. Such cooperation indicates that they have formed strategic alliances in order to safeguard their export destinations and economic advantages. The announcement comes in the wake of the trade ministers of the three countries meeting in a bid to intensify cooperation hence reducing the effects of the policies of the United States of America. However, tensions on the trade issue may even escalate further, and the odds of a trade war are still looming over the crypto market . These developments have led to alerts over various global financial markets, especially due to increasing integration of the national and global stages for business, especially in the crypto market. Bitcoin Price Analysis Amid Tariff Concerns The crypto market has already shown signs of distress, with Bitcoin experiencing a noticeable decline. As of March 31, Bitcoin was trading at $82,687, down nearly 2% in a 24-hour period. The cryptocurrency has faced a series of lower lows, with the most recent drop continuing a bearish trend. Bitcoin’s price has struggled to maintain its momentum, and the market has responded cautiously to global economic news. Overall, the activities in the US market play a key role for the Bitcoin price decrease. The US being close to ‘Liberation Day’ on April 2 when new tariffs are anticipated to be implemented, traders are preparing themselves for increased fluctuation in the crypto market. These aspects, including the future of global trade and uncertainty around what the US policies would be like for the world economy, has given investors more reason to pause. Bitcoin, in particular, has been caught in this downward spiral, with its price showing weaker momentum. Bitcoin’s recent price movement reflects a broader risk-off sentiment, with traders reducing exposure to more volatile assets. While Bitcoin was able to recover slightly after four consecutive days of decline, the overall sentiment remains bearish. Bitcoin has not managed to break past key resistance levels, and the possibility of further downward pressure remains high. Institutional Interest and Long-Term Outlook Despite the short-term declines in Bitcoin’s price, institutional interest in the cryptocurrency remains strong. On-chain data analyzed by Glassnode reveals that the number of addresses containing from 1000 to 10000 BTC has also been slowly rising, indicating that institutional investors are still active in the market. This acquisition by institutional investors shows that investors are increasing their holdings of Bitcoin in the long-term despite short-term downturns. At the same time, the Fear & Greed Index is still in the “fear” territory, which means that traders are concern about long-term impact of the tariffs. Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index is 34. Fear Current price: $82,687 pic.twitter.com/wDyPuGshJG — Bitcoin Fear and Greed Index (@BitcoinFear) March 31, 2025 Similarly, XRP and Cardano (ADA) alongside Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Ethereum (ETH) have been on the decline due to the general bearish crypto market. Additionally, Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have shown sustained inflows, highlighting that there is still demand for Bitcoin from institutional traders. This ongoing interest from large investors contrasts with the risk-off sentiment observed in the broader market. However, analysts remain cautious, as the tariffs and economic uncertainty could keep Bitcoin’s price rangebound in the short term. Bitcoin’s Price Resistance Should Crypto Market Decline Persist Bitcoin price has reached important support and resistance zones, and analysts like Rekt Capital are also considering these levels crucial. For the moment, Bitcoin is hovering slightly above the $82000 level. The immediate target on the upside is found at $85,000 which has offered a major resistance to Bitcoin in the past few days. If the Bitcoin price can get through this level and establish an upward movement, then there could be some kind of a bounce back. However, if the tariffs result in further economic instability, Bitcoin may struggle to maintain its price levels. Some analysts suggest that Bitcoin could experience a V-shaped recovery if the market stabilizes. On the other hand, if the bearish trend continues, Bitcoin price could see further declines, potentially testing lower support levels around $70,000 or even below, depending on the market’s reaction to the tariffs and global trade tensions.

According to a new Fortune report , USDC-issuer Circle is working with JPMorgan Chase and Citi Bank to publicly list the firm’s shares next month. Citing “two sources familiar with the situation” Fortune reports that Circle is planning to file the paperwork for the IPO in late April. Circle filed for the traditional IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January 2024. Circle has tried filing for an IPO in previous years, but the firm’s last attempt was abandoned following the FTX collapse in 2022. According to the report, the impending IPO has the potential to be the biggest crypto IPO since Coinbase went public in 2021. Citi Bank and JPMorgan also advised Coinbase before going public. USDC stablecoins are officially issued by Circle and are redeemable 1:1 for US dollars. USDC is the second-largest stablecoin with a market cap of more than $53 billion, second only to USDT, which has a market cap of nearly $140 billion. USDT is issued by the crypto firm Tether. In December, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said that US dollar-pegged stablecoins could become a “mass export product” of the US. “First and foremost, we have to focus on the strength and competitiveness of the dollar first. We have a situation in the world where while the dollar is the reserve currency, there are lots and lots of places in the world that don’t want the dollar to be that currency. So first we need full reserve digital dollars, like stablecoins to become a mass export product of the United States and if there’s going to be a major currency of the internet, make sure it’s a digital dollar…” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Here’s an Altcoin That Could Go Even Higher,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/should-you-buy-cardano-ada-now-before-it-hits-5-heres-an-altcoin-that-could-go-even-higher/,"This week, Cardano (ADA) has gained 4%, with the asset trading at around $0.74 as bullish pressure builds. Long-to-short Cardano (ADA) on-chain metrics indicate a ratio of 1.15—the highest in the last three months—while stablecoin activity on the network races ahead by over 30.77 million on the all-time table. Analysts are claiming that if $0.77 resistance is broken, it could spark a 13% rally for Cardano (ADA), but uncertainty looms large. Elsewhere, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) just hit phase 4 of its presale at $0.025, putting early buyers at a 140% profit at its $0.06 listing price As phase 4 fills fast (20% increase to $0.03 coming), investors have to analyze the slow steady rise Cardano (ADA) against the potential rushing nature of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Cardano’s Precarious Position Cardano’s recovery comes after weeks of consolidating between $0.69 and $0.75 that left traders cautiously bullish. Accumulation signs from exchange outflows show $13.75 million in Cardano (ADA), but possible sell-offs follow dormant wallets. Technical setups indicate an ascending triangle is forming, which could see Cardano (ADA) price levels heading towards $0.90 if momentum remains intact. However, the tightening of Bollinger Bands warns of volatility, while the neutral position of RSI highlights indecision. Cardano (ADA) DeFi growth does continue to show promise, but an 18% drop in volume reflects reticence. For those Cardano (ADA) investors who are looking for speedy returns, these mixed signals pale in comparison to a quantifiable presale trajectory from Mutuum Finance. The Calculated Ascent of Mutuum Finance $5.8 million raised and 7,500 holders on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as Phase 4 tokens at $0.025 Those who buy in now can then profit 20% as the next stage brings the price to $0.03. Tokenomics ensures a 140% profit at launch, but forecasts post-listing are even more ambitious: analysts name $1.50 as a conservative target for 2025, that’s a whopping 5,900% ROI from current prices. While ADA’s value currently hinges on largely speculative expectations, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem derives real utility, and thus demand, through its lending protocol that redistributes revenue to stakers, creating buy pressure that doesn’t decline from one speculative rally to the next. Security is a top priority on Mutuum Finance as well, and Certik is currently auditing their smart contracts. Results will soon be relayed through official channels, enhancing investor confidence. With its phased presale structure, the project dramatically increases the urgency of each increment, as fewer and fewer options will be available to access tokens at ever-lower prices. Why Timing Matters Now Cardano is losing ground, but can still can reach $5 if enough resistance levels are broken and volatility isn’t a factor. In contrast, since Mutuum Finance’s presale has well-defined returns, uncertainty is avoided. For those who participate early, they benefit from algorithmic buy mechanisms as well as mtTokens that will earn interest over time. Due to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) phase 4 filling quicker than earlier phases, pausing could result in missing the 20% gain from pre-launch. Don’t Miss Out on Your Early Advantage If Cardano walks its way towards a cautious target, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a quicker path. In contrast, the phase 4 lock of its $0.025 presale price stands in stark contrast to ADA’s painful grind. Coupled with the project’s revenue-driven tokenomics and Certik audit progress, it provides a structured alternative in unpredictable markets. And for anyone who cares more about measurable growth than wishful thinking, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) window is closing.

APX plans to add more digital assets and fiat currencies options in the near future. The company claims to be expanding its reach to the United States, with future expansions planned for Australia and New Zealand pending regulatory approval. Andrei Poliakov, founder and CEO of APX Lending, said in a statement: “By engaging with Canadian regulators and leading the way in Canada, we are setting a new benchmark for compliance and security in crypto-backed lending, helping retail and institutional borrowers unlock liquidity while maintaining ownership of their digital assets."" APX loans range from 20%-60% loan-to-value (LTV), with an automated liquidation mechanism triggered at 90% if no corrective action is taken by the borrower to top up collateral or partially repay the loan when LTV reaches the 80% warning level and they are notified of the potential liquidation. Loan terms range from three months to five years, reflecting the comparatively flexible structure of crypto-backed lending versus the more rigid and often less accessible options found in traditional financial systems. APX Lending is registered with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC). Its key competitors in the local market include Ledn, Nexo, and YouHodler, among others.

However, Carney’s 2025 platform outlined goals to make Canada a global leader in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and “digital industries” amid increasing geopolitical competition and trade tensions with the United States .

Pi Network and Stellar (XLM) are no exception. Both projects are approaching key inflection points that could dictate whether they rebound—or retrace further. Yet while Pi and XLM wait for outside confirmation, BlockDAG is already building internal momentum. With more than 800,000 miners actively engaged, a presale crossing $209.5 million, and a fast-approaching mainnet backed by a working Testnet, BlockDAG is assembling the infrastructure most projects only talk about after launch. For investors evaluating sustainability, adoption, and scalability, the contrast is becoming increasingly clear. Pi Network Outlook: Can a Binance Listing Spark a 65% April Recovery? Following a sharp 65% decline in March, Pi Network is now trading near $0.83—a level that reflects mounting pressure from unmet exchange expectations. Despite over 80% of users voting for a Binance listing, no progress has been confirmed, leaving community sentiment muted. That said, April could become a pivotal month. A Binance listing, combined with broader market stability, could help fuel a recovery. Technically, Pi has formed a falling wedge—a bullish pattern—and the BBTrend indicator is showing divergence. Should Pi break resistance, price could climb toward $1.50, recapturing lost ground. Still, challenges remain. A scheduled unlock of 117 million tokens in April may add significant sell-side pressure. Without a strong catalyst or listing confirmation, any upside could be short-lived. XLM Analysis: $0.28 as the Line Between Rebound and Retest Stellar (XLM) finds itself in a sensitive zone, with price hovering around $0.286. A confirmed breakdown below the $0.28 level could lead to a 15% slide toward $0.236, especially given recent weakness in volume and sentiment. While XLM is still trading above the 200-day EMA, momentum has clearly slowed. Volume has fallen 10% over the past 24 hours, and Coinglass data shows significant short interest building near $0.297. That imbalance, coupled with a bearish wedge pattern, presents a real risk of reversal. However, if XLM closes above $0.31 on the daily chart, it could invalidate the bearish setup and reintroduce bullish momentum. Until then, price activity in the $0.285–$0.28 range will likely define the next trend direction. BlockDAG’s 800K+ Miners and Keynote 3 Reveal Why $1 Isn’t Just Possible—It’s Plausible Where others are waiting on listings or market sentiment to push growth, BlockDAG is actively engineering its breakout. A key highlight from Keynote 3 was the explosive rise of the X1 Miner App, now used by more than 800,000 individuals globally. These aren’t idle users—they’re daily participants helping drive token generation and ecosystem activity before launch. BlockDAG’s success isn’t theoretical. The Beta Testnet is live, processing transactions and engaging a distributed node network. With zero-cost mobile mining, gamification, and a simplified onboarding process, it has created an early community that reflects real demand—not just investor curiosity. On the financial side, BlockDAG has now raised over $209.5 million, sold more than 19 billion BDAG tokens, and remains in Batch 27 at just $0.0248. A confirmed rollout across 10+ centralized exchanges post-mainnet adds to the forward visibility, suggesting a price ceiling much higher than current levels. And with integrated tools like a Token & NFT Creator, cross-chain bridges, and developer-ready support for WASM and EVM, BlockDAG isn’t just launching a blockchain—it’s launching an ecosystem primed for scale. If BDAG reaches $1, as some analysts are beginning to forecast, the current presale offers an entry point with 40x potential. But more importantly, it presents a model for how early-stage projects can combine infrastructure, adoption, and usability into meaningful long-term value. Strategic Takeaway Both Pi and XLM are approaching pivotal decision points. Pi’s outlook hinges on external action—namely, whether Binance moves to list it—and its tokenomics may complicate any short-term recovery. XLM, meanwhile, faces immediate downside risk unless key support levels hold and momentum reverses. By comparison, BlockDAG is taking a fundamentally different route. It’s deploying real tools, distributing hardware, and engaging a growing user base ahead of its public debut. These aren’t speculative promises—they’re live operations creating a strong foundation. For forward-looking investors, the key may lie in identifying which assets are building resilience now—not just hoping for momentum later. BlockDAG’s execution to date suggests it could be one of the few projects prepared to enter the next phase of crypto growth already in motion.

In a statement , the regulatory agency says that its Division of Market Oversight (DMO) and Division of Clearing and Risk (DCR) decided to withdraw CFTC Staff Advisory No. 18-14 (Advisory with Respect to Virtual Currency Derivative Product Listings) effective immediately. The DMO and the DCR originally issued the advisory on May 21st, 2018, to provide guidance on enhanced standards for derivative contracts to be listed on a designated contract market (DCM) or swap execution facility (SEF), or to be cleared by a derivatives clearing organization (DCO). At the time, the DMO and the DCR said that the risks of the crypto markets justify scrutiny by the CFTC staff and registered entities. “In light of the risks discussed above, staff highlights certain key areas that require particular attention in the context of listing a new virtual currency derivatives contract pursuant to Commission Regulation 40.2 or 40.3. The topics are: (A) enhanced market surveillance; (B) coordination with CFTC staff; (C) large trader reporting; (D) outreach to stakeholders; and (E) DCO risk management.” On March 27th, the CFTC announced the withdrawal of the advisory. The agency says the guidance reflected the thinking of its staff in 2018 based on experience with crypto derivatives products. “DMO and DCR determined that the advisory is no longer needed given additional staff experience with virtual currency derivative product listings and increasing market growth and maturity.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Experts believe Ripple’s progress in its legal fight was factored in long ago, leaving little surprise for traders. Meanwhile, PEPE is gaining traction after a whale added over 500 billion tokens, and holding activity grew 15.3% during March. Analysts now believe that if PEPE clears resistance barriers, a 300% increase could follow. Yet, the most solid upward momentum appears to belong to BlockDAG (BDAG) . Keynote 3 outlined a $209.5 million presale, a live beta testnet successfully handling 1.2 million transactions, and over 800,000 users mining through the X1 mobile app. BlockDAG is actively delivering, not speculating. With DeFi features, more than 16,600 miners distributed, and listings on 10 or more exchanges expected, BDAG is clearly securing its status as a major Layer-1 player. XRP Faces Decline Despite Legal Success XRP continues to face downward pressure, dropping nearly 4% even after Ripple’s favorable court rulings and liquidity efforts. It recently traded between $2.37 and $2.26 before declining, surprising many who expected stronger movement. Nansen analyst Nicolai Sondergaard explained that much of Ripple’s courtroom progress was already reflected in XRP’s price. Since mid-2023, gradual increases suggested confidence in a positive legal outcome. This week’s lackluster response indicates traders were not caught off guard. In addition, global uncertainty spiked following comments by former President Trump about potential tariffs, which further dampened market confidence. Although legal clarity remains beneficial for XRP over time, short-term price swings and broader economic worries are dragging it down. For those with a long-term outlook, the current dip could be a chance, but entry timing remains critical. PEPE Whale Buys 506B Tokens: Could It Trigger a 300% Price Rise? A prominent whale has moved 506.2 billion PEPE tokens—worth about $4.4 million—off Binance, fueling speculation about a potential breakout. Known as Qianbaidu.eth, the whale’s holdings now approach 700 billion PEPE, building on an earlier $7.3 million profit. This activity is part of a broader trend. Wallets holding 1T–10T PEPE have increased by 15.3% since March, showing strong support. Even after a slight dip to $0.00000859, PEPE is still up 13% over the past seven days. Analysts point to technical indicators like a double bottom and declining exchange supply as bullish signs. Should PEPE surpass resistance at $0.00002384, $0.00002965, and $0.00003466, a 300% surge may unfold. With more whale moves and meme coin excitement building, PEPE could be close to another big run. Those eyeing entry points might want to watch closely. BlockDAG Nears $1 Target as Keynote 3 Confirms Major Milestones BlockDAG isn’t relying on speculation—it’s sticking to a structured roadmap, and the recent Keynote 3 event reinforced its direction. With $209.5 million raised, over 19 billion coins distributed, and the current presale price at $0.0248, BDAG is progressing toward a $1 market cap target. The keynote announced significant achievements: a beta testnet running live with over 1.2 million transactions processed, more than 800,000 users mining via the X1 Miner App , 16,600+ miners delivered, and partnerships with brands like UFC and Inter Milan. The project is distributing hardware, operating dApps, and rewarding X1 users through testnet airdrops before the mainnet even launches. Unlike many others that start without usable tools, BlockDAG is already up and running with features like DeFi protocols, NFT capabilities, and EVM integration. The extension of the presale was made to improve network speed, protection, and scale. With a 150 billion total supply and listings planned on 10+ exchanges, time is limited. BDAG’s price has risen by 2,380% since Batch 1, and momentum continues to grow. Keynote 3 didn’t simply share updates—it demonstrated delivery. The $1 mark isn’t farfetched—it’s a reasonable goal based on current progress. Missing this moment could mean chasing a much higher price later. Final Thoughts While XRP deals with broader economic concerns and PEPE aims to break through resistance, BlockDAG is showing what consistent delivery looks like. PEPE may rise if its current push holds, and XRP still has long-term appeal—but both are subject to shifting sentiment and timing. BlockDAG, in contrast, is moving fast on all fronts. From its working testnet and brand collaborations to its full suite of DeFi tools, every part of BlockDAG’s path to $1 is actively in motion. The presale has already jumped 2,380% from the start, giving early participants a real head start before exchange listings. What sets BlockDAG apart is its pace—building now, expanding now, and scaling now.

42713760,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144800,1743451817,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"DEX Revolution: Hyperliquid Dev Exposes Critical Flaws, Predicts End of CEX Dominance",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/dex-flaws-cex-dominance-hyperliquid/,"The recent Jelly short squeeze incident sent ripples through the crypto sphere, exposing vulnerabilities within decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Shawn, a key developer in the Hyperliquid ecosystem, didn’t mince words when he pointed out these critical DEX flaws and questioned the long-term sustainability of centralized exchange (CEX) dominance. His insights, revealed in a candid interview with Wu Blockchain, are a wake-up call for the industry, urging a shift towards robust and truly decentralized solutions. Let’s delve into Shawn’s perspective and understand the implications for the future of crypto trading. Unveiling DEX Flaws: A Harsh Reality Check The Jelly short squeeze served as a stark reminder that while DEXs offer the promise of decentralization and self-custody, they are not without their Achilles’ heel. Shawn from Hyperliquid highlighted several key areas where DEXs currently fall short when compared to their centralized counterparts. These DEX flaws are not merely theoretical concerns; they are practical limitations that can have real-world consequences for traders and the broader crypto ecosystem. Risk Management Deficiencies: Shawn pointed out that DEXs, including Hyperliquid, need to bolster their risk management protocols, particularly for high-risk tokens. The Jelly incident underscored the need for more sophisticated mechanisms to prevent manipulative market activities. Lack of Open Interest Caps: Unlike many CEXs, DEXs often lack robust open interest caps. This absence can amplify volatility and increase the risk of significant price swings, as seen in the Jelly squeeze. Implementing such caps could provide a crucial safety net. Closed-Source Code Concerns: A significant portion of DEX code remains closed-source, hindering transparency and community-driven security audits. This lack of openness contrasts sharply with the ethos of decentralization and raises questions about trust and verifiability. Underdeveloped Tooling: DEXs are still in a phase of rapid development, and their tooling, especially for risk management and market surveillance, lags behind that of mature CEXs. Strengthening these tools is essential for DEXs to compete effectively and safely. Why CEX Dominance is Unsustainable: The Decentralization Imperative Shawn’s critique of DEX flaws isn’t a call for abandoning decentralization. Instead, it’s a rallying cry for improvement and innovation. He firmly believes that the long-term dominance of centralized exchanges is simply unsustainable. This conviction stems from a fundamental shift in user demand and the core principles of blockchain technology. Here’s why the tide is turning against perpetual CEX dominance : Rising Demand for Decentralization: The very essence of blockchain is decentralization. As crypto adoption grows, so does the awareness and demand for truly decentralized alternatives to traditional financial systems. Users are increasingly wary of entrusting their assets to centralized entities, especially after events like exchange collapses and regulatory crackdowns. Self-Custody and Security: DEXs empower users with self-custody, meaning they control their private keys and, therefore, their funds. This eliminates the counterparty risk associated with CEXs, where users essentially entrust their assets to the exchange’s custody. In a world increasingly concerned about security and privacy, self-custody is a major draw. Transparency and Auditability: While some DEX code is closed-source, the inherent nature of blockchain allows for greater transparency compared to traditional CEXs. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, and smart contracts, even if not fully open-source, offer a degree of auditability that is absent in centralized systems. Resistance to Censorship: Decentralized exchanges, by their nature, are more resistant to censorship and single points of failure. This is a critical advantage in a world where regulatory landscapes are constantly evolving and geopolitical risks loom large. Decentralized Exchanges: Charting the Course for the Future The question isn’t whether decentralized exchanges will play a significant role in the future of crypto trading; it’s how quickly and effectively they can overcome their current limitations. Shawn’s commentary is valuable because it pinpoints the areas that need immediate attention. For DEXs to truly challenge and eventually surpass CEXs, several key developments are crucial. Consider these pivotal steps for the evolution of decentralized exchanges : Enhanced Risk Management Protocols: DEXs must prioritize the development and implementation of sophisticated risk management tools. This includes features like dynamic open interest caps, circuit breakers, and advanced liquidation mechanisms. Open-Sourcing and Community Audits: Increased transparency through open-sourcing code and encouraging community-driven security audits will build trust and identify vulnerabilities more effectively. This collaborative approach is vital for strengthening DEX security. User-Friendly Interfaces and Tools: DEXs need to bridge the usability gap with CEXs. Developing intuitive interfaces, robust trading tools, and comprehensive analytics platforms will attract a wider user base, including less technically savvy traders. Cross-Chain Compatibility: The future of crypto is likely multi-chain. DEXs that can seamlessly operate across different blockchains will have a significant advantage, offering users access to a broader range of assets and trading opportunities. Navigating Crypto Regulation: DEXs and the Evolving Landscape The regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies is constantly evolving, and this has a profound impact on both DEXs and CEXs. While crypto regulation aims to protect investors and prevent illicit activities, it also presents challenges for the decentralized ethos of the crypto space. DEXs must proactively navigate this complex landscape to ensure their long-term viability. Key considerations for DEXs in the face of crypto regulation include: Compliance and KYC/AML: While decentralization is paramount, DEXs may need to explore ways to incorporate compliance measures, such as Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols, without compromising user privacy or decentralization principles. Solutions like decentralized identity and privacy-preserving KYC are being explored. Regulatory Clarity and Dialogue: Open communication and collaboration with regulators are crucial. DEX operators should actively engage in dialogues to help shape sensible regulations that foster innovation while addressing legitimate concerns. Decentralized Governance: Implementing robust decentralized governance mechanisms can enhance the resilience and adaptability of DEXs in the face of regulatory changes. Community-driven governance can ensure that DEXs evolve in a way that aligns with the needs of their users and the broader crypto ecosystem. Hyperliquid’s Actionable Insights: Towards Secure DEXs Shawn’s insights from Hyperliquid are not just critical observations; they are actionable recommendations for the entire DEX space. His emphasis on safeguards like open interest caps and improved risk management is a blueprint for building more secure and resilient Hyperliquid and other decentralized platforms. By taking these lessons to heart, the crypto community can collectively work towards realizing the full potential of DEXs. Here are some actionable insights derived from Hyperliquid’s experience: Prioritize Security Audits: Regular and thorough security audits, preferably by independent third-party firms, are essential for identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in DEX smart contracts and infrastructure. Implement Real-Time Risk Monitoring: DEXs should invest in real-time risk monitoring systems that can detect and alert operators to unusual market activity or potential exploits. Early detection is crucial for preventing significant losses. Educate Users on Risks: Transparency about the inherent risks of trading on DEXs, particularly with volatile or low-liquidity tokens, is paramount. User education initiatives can help traders make informed decisions and manage their risk effectively. Foster Community Collaboration: Building a strong and engaged community around DEX development and security is invaluable. Open communication, bug bounty programs, and collaborative research can significantly enhance the robustness of DEX protocols. Conclusion: Embracing the DEX Revolution Shawn’s candid assessment is a necessary catalyst for growth and improvement within the decentralized exchange landscape. The Jelly short squeeze, while concerning, has provided invaluable lessons. By acknowledging and addressing the existing DEX flaws , and by embracing the principles of decentralization, transparency, and community collaboration, the crypto industry can pave the way for a future where DEXs not only rival but surpass CEXs in terms of security, accessibility, and user empowerment. The revolution towards truly decentralized finance is underway, and the insights from Hyperliquid are crucial for navigating this transformative journey.

Dogecoin’s Accidental Rise Created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in 2013, Dogecoin began as a parody of early cryptocurrency hype. The Shiba Inu-themed coin unexpectedly gained traction, reaching a peak market cap of over $84 billion in 2021. DOGE, on the other hand, refers to Trump’s newly created agency aimed at cutting regulatory red tape and lowering government expenditures. The initiative launched in January after Trump returned to office and has already triggered controversy for laying off tens of thousands of federal workers. Musk’s growing visibility in Trump’s government initiatives has brought scrutiny, particularly following DOGE’s recommendation to eliminate thousands of federal positions . Elon Musk draws fire over Tesla share slump Elon Musk launched the America PAC in 2024 to support Trump’s campaign, with backers including Gemini co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and former Sequoia Capital partner Douglas Leone. The CEO’s involvement with the Trump administration has raised concerns among Tesla shareholders. “My Tesla stock, and the stock of everyone who owns Tesla, has roughly halved,” Musk said. “I mean, it’s a big deal.” Concerns from investors included not just Musk’s political alignment, but also confusion over whether Dogecoin would play a role in federal initiatives. As of Monday, Dogecoin was down about 1%. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What deeper systemic issues is the efficiency drive targeting within federal bureaucracy? DOGE intends to overhaul legacy IT and streamline administrative redundancies, spotlighting entrenched inefficiencies. However, aggressive cuts may reduce oversight and erode public trust in essential services. How might clearly dissociating Dogecoin from government use reshape tech and fiscal policy? By clearly dissociating Dogecoin from federal operations, policymakers can refocus on IT modernization and fiscal discipline, sidestepping market hype and keeping reforms rooted in practical outcomes. What are the potential risks and benefits of Musk’s approach to government efficiency? Musk’s strategy may deliver quick savings and modernize legacy systems, but it risks reducing oversight, losing veteran staff, and triggering constitutional disputes over executive authority.

Despite the recent rollercoaster ride in the crypto market, Bitcoin’s hashrate has not only held its ground but has spectacularly surged to unprecedented all-time highs. This powerful signal, highlighted by crypto market analyst Maartunn on X, speaks volumes about the underlying health and future prospects of the leading cryptocurrency. But what exactly does this mean for you, the everyday crypto enthusiast or investor? Let’s dive into the fascinating world of Bitcoin mining and unravel this crucial development. Decoding the Bitcoin Hashrate: A Powerhouse of Security First things first, let’s break down what Bitcoin hashrate actually is. Imagine the Bitcoin network as a giant, incredibly complex puzzle. Miners around the globe are constantly competing to solve this puzzle using powerful computers. The hashrate is essentially the total computational power being used by the entire Bitcoin network to mine new blocks and validate transactions. Think of it as the collective muscle of the Bitcoin blockchain. A higher hashrate means: Enhanced Network Security: A more powerful hashrate makes the Bitcoin network significantly more resistant to attacks. It becomes exponentially harder for malicious actors to compromise the blockchain because they would need to amass an unimaginable amount of computing power – more than the combined power of the entire network! This is a cornerstone of Bitcoin’s resilience and trustworthiness. Faster Transaction Processing (Indirectly): While hashrate doesn’t directly speed up individual transaction confirmation times, a robust hashrate ensures the network operates smoothly and consistently, processing transactions reliably. Increased Mining Difficulty: As more miners join the network and the hashrate increases, the Bitcoin protocol automatically adjusts the mining difficulty. This ensures that blocks are mined at a consistent average rate of approximately every 10 minutes, maintaining the predictable issuance of new Bitcoin. In essence, the Bitcoin hashrate is a vital sign of the network’s health and security. A consistently rising hashrate, especially during times of market volatility , is a testament to the unwavering commitment of miners to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Miner Confidence: The Driving Force Behind the Hashrate Surge Why is the hashrate surging now, even when the crypto market is experiencing ups and downs? The answer lies in miner confidence . Miners are the backbone of the Bitcoin network. Their investment in expensive hardware and energy resources is a long-term bet on the future of Bitcoin. The fact that they are continuing to ramp up their operations, pushing the hashrate to record levels, indicates a strong belief in Bitcoin’s long-term value proposition. Here’s what fuels this miner confidence: Long-Term Investment Horizon: Mining is not a short-term game. Miners invest in infrastructure with a multi-year perspective. They understand that market fluctuations are part of the crypto cycle and focus on the bigger picture – the increasing adoption and potential of Bitcoin over time. Technological Advancements: The mining industry is constantly evolving with more efficient and powerful mining hardware. New generations of ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) offer better performance and energy efficiency, making mining operations more profitable even during price dips. Global Adoption and Institutional Interest: Despite market volatility, the underlying trend of increasing global adoption of cryptocurrency , especially Bitcoin, remains strong. Growing institutional interest and the potential for wider regulatory clarity further bolster miner confidence in the long-term viability of Bitcoin. Navigating Market Volatility with a Strong Network The cryptocurrency market is notorious for its market volatility . Prices can fluctuate dramatically based on news, regulatory announcements, macroeconomic factors, and market sentiment. In such an environment, the surging Bitcoin hashrate provides a crucial anchor of stability. It signifies that regardless of short-term price swings, the fundamental infrastructure of Bitcoin remains robust and is actively being strengthened. Consider this analogy: Imagine a ship navigating through stormy seas (market volatility). The stronger the ship’s engine and hull (Bitcoin hashrate and network), the better it can weather the storm and continue its journey. The record-high hashrate suggests that Bitcoin’s ‘ship’ is becoming increasingly resilient, capable of navigating even the most turbulent market conditions. Benefits of a Record-High Bitcoin Hashrate: Why Should You Care? So, how does this surging hashrate directly benefit you? Increased Security for Your Bitcoin Holdings: A higher hashrate translates to a more secure Bitcoin network. This means your Bitcoin transactions and holdings are better protected against potential attacks and manipulations. Long-Term Network Stability: The consistent investment by miners in infrastructure, reflected in the rising hashrate, ensures the long-term stability and reliability of the Bitcoin network. This is crucial for Bitcoin’s role as a decentralized and dependable store of value and medium of exchange. Positive Signal for the Bitcoin Ecosystem: The hashrate surge is a positive indicator for the overall Bitcoin ecosystem. It reflects the confidence of key stakeholders (miners) in the future of Bitcoin and its underlying technology. Challenges and Considerations While a rising hashrate is overwhelmingly positive, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Environmental Concerns: Bitcoin mining can be energy-intensive, and concerns about its environmental impact persist. However, the industry is increasingly moving towards more sustainable energy sources and exploring innovative solutions to reduce its carbon footprint. Mining Centralization: While the Bitcoin network is decentralized, there are concerns about the concentration of hashrate among a few large mining pools. Efforts are ongoing to promote greater decentralization in mining operations. Profitability Fluctuations: Miner profitability is influenced by factors like Bitcoin price, mining difficulty, and energy costs. While miner confidence is currently high, these factors can fluctuate and impact mining operations. Actionable Insights: What Can You Learn from the Hashrate Surge? The surging Bitcoin hashrate offers valuable insights for anyone involved in the cryptocurrency space: Long-Term Vision: Focus on the long-term fundamentals of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, rather than being swayed by short-term market noise. The hashrate surge is a testament to the enduring strength of Bitcoin’s foundation. Network Health Matters: Pay attention to network metrics like hashrate, transaction volume, and active addresses. These indicators provide a deeper understanding of the health and activity of a cryptocurrency network beyond just price movements. Miner Activity as a Sentiment Indicator: Miner behavior, as reflected in hashrate trends, can serve as a valuable sentiment indicator for the cryptocurrency market. High hashrate often signals strong underlying confidence in the long-term prospects of a cryptocurrency. Conclusion: Bitcoin’s Unwavering Foundation The record-breaking Bitcoin hashrate amidst market volatility is a powerful and unstoppable signal. It underscores the resilience, security, and long-term potential of Bitcoin. As miners continue to invest in infrastructure and push the hashrate to new heights, they are not just securing the network; they are solidifying their belief in the future of decentralized digital currency. For investors, enthusiasts, and anyone interested in the crypto space, this surge is a compelling reminder of Bitcoin’s enduring strength and its capacity to thrive even in the face of market uncertainties. The foundation of Bitcoin remains robust, built on a bedrock of unwavering miner confidence and a continuously strengthening network.

42715209,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=703193,1743453656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42715209.jpeg,Coinbase CEO urges lawmakers to enable on-chain interest for stablecoin holders,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/coinbase-ceo-stablecoin-interest/,"Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has called for legislation allowing stablecoin holders to earn interest on the digital currency. In a recent article published on X, Armstrong said allowing on-chain interest for stablecoins could have a massive impact on growing stablecoin adoption. Under the current structure for dollar-pegged stablecoins such as USDT and USDC, the issuers of the stablecoins get all the interest earned from the reserve assets backing the stablecoin. However, Armstrong wants the holders to get a share of that as on-chain interest. He explained: “Onchain interest is the ability of a stablecoin to function as a form of payment and directly deliver interest earned on reserve assets to the stablecoin holder, effectively an interest-bearing checking account.” According to Armstrong, technology exists to enable this for existing stablecoins, but most issuers cannot do so because of the law. Securities laws currently grant exemptions to checking and savings accounts that allow them to pay interest to users, but stablecoins do not have the same exemption. Therefore, the law needs to change so that stablecoins are treated like regular savings accounts. This will allow issuers to enable on-chain interests without worrying about regulatory implications. The Coinbase CEO added that now is the best time to pass such legislation because a pro-crypto administration and Congress are working on stablecoin laws. On-chain stablecoin interest to benefit Consumers Meanwhile, Armstrong noted that enabling on-chain interest in stablecoins will be a big win for consumers in the US and globally. According to him, US consumers will be the biggest beneficiaries, just as they are the ones losing the most from the lack of on-chain interests. He explained this by pointing to the average yield for savings accounts versus that of Federal Reserve funds. On average, the yield for Fed funds is 4.75%, while savings accounts have 0.41%, with most of them paying around 0.01%. This low yield from savings accounts, Armstrong said, leaves savings account users at a disadvantage, given that the inflation rate is around 3%. Thus, implementing on-chain interest for stablecoins will allow more people to have access to a 4% yield. He said: “There is a clear solution: onchain interest democratizes access to the market rate yield rate, giving regular people a fair shot at maintaining and growing their wealth.” The CEO added that on-chain will also benefit stablecoin holders in other countries, strengthening US dollar hegemony while boosting the US economy by increasing the amount US residents can generate on their savings. All in all, he believes it will be a positive development for consumers and the US ecosystem. Armstrong concluded, saying: “Consumers deserve a bigger piece of the pie. Opening the door for onchain interest will force us all to up our game for the ultimate benefit of consumers, and will keep this innovation onshore.” Unsurprisingly, the proposal has attracted positive feedback from most quarters, with many in support of it. However, some do not believe it is necessary. Crypto entrepreneur and legal expert Artem Tolkachev noted that the idea is only fair at first glance and not on closer look. According to Tolkachev, bank accounts do not pay interest by default; that is just how it is in crypto. He pointed to several DeFi platforms where users can get yield on their capital when they take certain actions, noting this is the ideal thing and not lock-in stablecoin yields, only centralize the system and damage the broader crypto ecosystem.

In its presale, the project has already surpassed $14.2 million, with more than 524 million tokens sold at $0.0734, showing the presence of hype in the market. According to experts in a recent blockchain guide, Remittix’s PayFi model has the potential to change the way international payments are carried out globally. In the meantime, another market report mentions Remittix as a potential project to threaten XRP’s dominance in the global settlement space. XRP: A Contender With Continuing Challenges XRP has been the go-to project when it comes to cross-border payments for a long time, dominating the scene as a result of its partnerships with several financial institutions. According to experts, the platform’s low fees and speed of transaction makes it the perfect choice for high-volume bank transactions. However, XRP has been held back by regulatory agencies, which has slowed its performance, offering a chance for new projects in the same scene to dominate. In a recent survey carried out, traders acknowledged that new projects are coming into the industry, providing the same payment services that XRP has been providing. XRP/USD Chart Although rumors of a potential exchange-traded product of XRP in the space have drawn in more institutional investors, the competition remains. A live Bitcoin blog recently mentioned that XRP will need to continue making improvements or risk being left behind. The issue has led investors to seek other projects with the same services but with additional ease of business. This opportunity provides the perfect entrance for projects like Remittix to pull in users in the digital payment sector. Remittix (RTX): A Visionary Solution The PayFi protocol that Remittix operates allows the platform to carry out real-time conversion between 40+ digital assets and 30+ currencies. According to a crypto analytics website, Remittix solves one of the biggest pain points in the market, connecting digital assets to the traditional finance industry. Additional proof from an ROI also shows that Remittix has what it takes to perform better than legacy payment tokens in a bull market. The platform’s decentralized governance model also provides the perfect place for traders looking for open control of updates and transaction fees. Aside from its hype, Remittix is out to solve real issues, providing the perfect solutions for the entire market. The platform helps local freelancers charge international clients in their local currency, allowing them to receive payments to that effect. At the same time, a look into its cross-border attributes show that Remittix can be used by the unbanked to avoid settlement delays. These practical uses in the real world, coupled with its great presale makes the project one of the best in the industry. How RTX Will Surpass XRP in the Long Run The remittance market, currently worth trillions of dollars, has provided the perfect opportunity for projects with lower costs, and speedier, and more transparent payment routes. According to experts, XRP has an institution-driven path, which is nice, but could end up restricting user freedom in the long run. On the other hand, the decentralized platform that Remittix runs is in the perfect position to respond to the needs of users, according to a payment solutions board. Other arguments from experts suggest that XRP is in the best position to enter the space that is left behind by XRP’s failure to keep up. The project’s achievement in its presale also shows investor confidence in utility-based digital assets. A technical analysis report called RTX’s mission the provision of a method that will make it easier for migrants to send money home. Already, Remittix is currently leading other payment platforms when it comes to user adoption. Analysts in an international tech magazine also added that the project could get a share of the $190 trillion market. Conclusion: The Future Direction The established XRP brand and bank relationships make it a big contender in the liquidity solutions industry. However, one crypto news ticker mentioned that 2025 is the year that decentralized payment platforms see attention from the international community. Remittix is positioned to take the lead in this space due to its community-driven governance model, utility, and success in the ongoing presale. A complete blockchain feature also sees the project’s PayFi architecture as the best for addressing the needs of modern remittances. A price forecast shows that the project has room for an impressive ROI, while a Binance Square overview confirms the attention it is getting from investors. If you are seeking a payment-focused digital asset with nice cross-border benefits, then Remittix is the project you have been waiting for. Partake in the revolution of the future finance and think about investing in Remittix in your portfolio before its presale period ends.

Market data shows that the ETH/BTC ratio has dropped to its lowest level in five years. Consequently, investors and analysts are now questioning whether Ethereum can recover in the coming quarter, considering Bitcoin may continue its long-standing domination in the digital assets market. The Ethereum Bitcoin Ratio At New Lows ETH performed poorly compared to Bitcoin in the first quarter of 2025. According to a recent update from The Kobeissi Letter, the Ethereum to Bitcoin ratio has dropped to 0.02, its lowest level since December 2020. Historically, Ethereum has gained strength after Bitcoin halvings, but the trend has reversed. While Bitcoin price is going upward, Ethereum has struggled to gain traction. Several factors have contributed to this decline. Bitcoin’s narrative as digital gold has strengthened, drawing more institutional investment. In addition, the coin has faced challenges, including relatively higher gas fees and competition from other blockchain networks. Unfortunately, the Ethereum Pectra upgrade, which experts believe could drive a price increase for the coin, faced some challenges. As reported by CoinGape, multiple testnet attempts failed before the Hoodi testnet that launched recently. Some experts believe Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake has not delivered the expected market boost. Q1 Performance and ETF Downturn The ETH price performance in the first quarter of 2025 has been disappointing. For context, data shows that the coin has dropped 46% this year, nearly 4 times more than Bitcoin’s decline of 12%. Many investors expected a strong bull run, but Ethereum has remained weak. The adoption of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year attracted billions of dollars, but Ethereum has not seen the same level of interest for its potential ETF. Market analysts suggest that institutional investors are still hesitant about Ethereum’s long-term value compared to Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s fixed supply and reputation as a hedge against inflation have made it a safer choice for institutional investors. Where is ETH Price Heading? Some analysts believe ETH price could hit $10,000 if broader market conditions improve and the Ethereum Pectra upgrade launches on the mainnet. Others warn that if the coin continues to lose value against Bitcoin, investors may start shifting funds to other networks like Solana or Avalanche. Even though short-term price predictions remain speculative, some traders expect Ethereum to rebound as Bitcoin stabilizes. Others believe the ETH/BTC ratio could drop even further. As of this publication, CoinMarketCap data shows that Ethereum’s price was $1,842.29, up 1.34% in the last 24 hours. Many experts believe that the coming days will determine whether Ethereum can regain strength or whether Bitcoin’s dominance will continue to grow.

On April 1, voters in Florida’s 1st and 6th congressional districts will head to the polls to decide whether to keep Republican representatives or hand over control to Democrats for the first time in roughly 30 years. The Defend American Jobs PAC — an affiliate of Fairshake, which poured more than $131 million in the 2024 US election cycle — has spent a combined $1.5 million on media for Republicans Jimmy Patronis and Randy Fine, running against Democrats Gay Valimont and Josh Weil, respectively. Source: Gay Valimont for Congress Though the Florida congressional districts have historically favored Republican candidates, Democrats Valimont and Weil both raised significantly more than Patronis and Fine as of March — a reported roughly $6.5 million and $10 million against the Republicans’ $1 million and $1 million, respectively. These amounts do not reflect the media buys from PACs like Defend American Jobs or Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s America PAC, which spent more than $20,000 for texting services in the two congressional elections. As of March 31, there were four vacant seats in the US House of Representatives following two Democratic lawmakers dying and two Republicans resigning in anticipation of positions with the Trump administration. If Democrats were to keep their existing two seats and flip the two in Florida, Republicans’ majority in the chamber would narrow to 217 to 218 — not changing majority control, but likely influencing how the House would consider legislation and policy. Among the crypto-related legislation being considered in Congress included a market structure bill and stablecoin regulation. Some lawmakers have suggested that they intended to get both bills passed before Congress goes on recess in August. Related: Florida bill proposes strict rules against online gambling Michigan Representative Shri Thanedar, a Democrat who described himself as largely self-funded and may have benefitted from crypto-backed PAC money in his 2024 race, spoke to Cointelegraph on March 27 about the role the industry could have on future elections. Protect Progress — another Fairshake-affiliated PAC — spent more than $1 million on a media buy to support the Michigan representative in his August 2024 primary. He defeated Republican Martell Bivings in November with 68% of the vote. “I was surprised to see those ads,” Thanedar told Cointelegraph, referring to Protect Progress’ media outreach. “I was not aware that such an ad would be appearing in support of my campaign.” The Michigan lawmaker added: “Crypto is not unique to this. There are multiple industries [...] that have PACs and Super PACs and independent expenditures. All of that money, the dark money in our politics, has to go. As long as we have the dark money in politics, that is going to impact our politicians.” Looking to the 2026 midterms After many Democratic and Republican candidates espousing “pro-crypto” views won in the 2024 elections, Fairshake spokesperson Josh Vlasto said the PAC was “keeping [its] foot on the gas” in the future. Major firms like Coinbase and Ripple Labs have contributed tens of millions of dollars to the PAC. As of January, Fairshake reported holding more than $116 million to spend on candidates in 2025 and 2026. Vlasto declined to comment on the April 1 special elections but said after the January primaries , the PAC was “proud to support [Patronis and Fine] with TV ad campaigns.” Magazine: Trump’s crypto ventures raise conflict of interest, insider trading questions",,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-31 20:58:42

In 2028, SHIB can reach a maximum value of $0.000079. The price of Shiba Inu is predicted to reach an average value of $0.000213 in 2031. The Shiba Inu (SHIB) cryptocurrency, originally a meme coin, has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem with significant growth and utility. Key components include ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange, and Shibarium, a Layer 2 solution to enhance scalability. These developments have boosted SHIB’s adoption and functionality. As SHIB’s ecosystem grows, questions arise about its future price trajectory. Will the advancements in ShibaSwap and Shibarium drive SHIB to new highs? Can SHIB sustain its current price momentum and solidify its position in the crypto market? Will SHIB ever reach $1?

Forming an ascending channel indicates increasing buyer interest and potential for continued gains. If SHIB fails to hold this level, it may face a pullback, weakening short-term bullish sentiment. Shiba Inu (SHIB) trades at $0.00001314 on 31st March, a 1.46% increase over the last 24 hours. The token has shown a slight uptrend after facing fluctuations in recent trading sessions. The 24-hour price range has been between $0.0000128 (low) and $0.00001318 (high), indicating moderate volatility. Despite this upward movement, SHIB remains significantly below its all-time high of $0.00008845, recorded on October 28, 2021, with a decline of approximately 85.14%. Recent market activity suggests a recovery phase as SHIB’s price is experiencing higher and higher lows, signaling potential bullish momentum. The trading volume and market sentiment indicate increased interest among traders. External market factors, including broader cryptocurrency trends, investor sentiment, and updates within the Shibarium ecosystem, continue to influence SHIB’s price action. The coin’s on-chain data also reflects steady accumulation, hinting at potential long-term interest from holders. Shiba analysis on the daily timeframe: SHIB consolidates as bulls eye a breakout toward $0.00001400 The daily chart highlights a consolidation phase with SHIB fluctuating between $0.0000128 and $0.00001318 over the past 24 hours.** The price has been attempting to break key resistance levels, with bulls maintaining control above the $0.00001300 support zone. The upward price movement aligns with increasing trading volume, indicating buyers are stepping in at lower price levels. The next significant resistance level is near $0.00001350, where sellers may attempt to push prices downward. If SHIB can maintain its momentum above this level, a breakout toward $0.00001400 could be possible. 1-day hour chart: TradingView The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a potential bullish crossover, suggesting increased buying momentum. The 50-day moving average is currently supported, while the 200-day moving average remains above the current price level, signaling that a long-term trend reversal is still uncertain. If SHIB fails to sustain its gains, a retracement toward $0.00001280 remains possible. 4-hour chart analysis: SHIB faces key resistance as short-term bullish momentum builds SHIB has seen an increase in volatility, with price swings between $0.0000128 and $0.00001318 over the past trading sessions. The price is forming an ascending channel, indicating short-term bullish pressure. However, resistance near $0.00001320-$0.00001330 could challenge further upside movement. A successful breakout above this range might push SHIB toward $0.00001350, while rejection at this level could trigger a decline back to $0.00001290-$0.00001280 support. 4-hour chart: TradingView The RSI on the 4-hour chart is currently around 58, suggesting that buying pressure is increasing but has not yet reached an overbought condition. The MACD histogram shows a bullish divergence, indicating growing momentum. However, the Bollinger Bands suggest that SHIB is nearing an overextension, meaning a price correction could occur if resistance remains strong. If bears take control, the $0.00001280 level must hold to prevent further declines. Is Shiba Inu a good investment? Shiba Inu (SHIB) remains a highly volatile asset, making it suitable for traders seeking short-term opportunities but risky for long-term investors. While bullish momentum is building with an ascending channel formation, resistance at $0.00001350 could limit gains, and a drop below $0.00001280 may trigger a pullback. SHIB’s future depends on Shibarium adoption, market sentiment, and ecosystem growth. As a speculative investment, it requires strong risk management and should be part of a diversified portfolio.

Shiba Inu (SHIB) has made strides with the launch of Shibarium, its Layer-2 blockchain, and a partnership with Chainlink, boosting cross-chain functionality and utility. The upcoming TREAT token – expected to play a significant role in Shiba Inu’s reward system and governance mechanisms – further expands its ecosystem. While promising, SHIB remains highly speculative and subject to market swings, so proceed cautiously as a trader or investor. Will Shiba Inu recover? Shiba Inu is experiencing fluctuations with a recent upward trend; there are signs of potential recovery. Will SHIB reach $0.00005? Yes, according to the long-term predictions, SHIB is projected to reach up to $0.00005 by 2027. Will SHIB reach $0.0001 Yes, according to the long-term predictions, SHIB is projected to reach up to $0.0001 by 2029. Will SHIB reach $100? Reaching $100 for SHIB is virtually impossible due to its vast circulating supply and the astronomically high market capitalization it would necessitate. Does SHIB have an excellent long-term future? SHIB shows some positive movement, suggesting the ecosystem may have a promising long-term future. However, its success will depend on continued adoption, broader market adoption trends, and other cryptocurrency market space developments.

Circle, the powerhouse behind the USDC stablecoin, is reportedly gearing up for a highly anticipated Initial Public Offering (IPO). This move, backed by financial giants JPMorgan and Citibank, signals a maturing cryptocurrency market and could pave the way for more mainstream adoption. Let’s dive into what this exciting development means for you and the future of digital finance. Circle IPO Plans Gain Momentum According to a recent report from Fortune Crypto, Circle is strategically planning to file for its IPO as early as late April. The company is aiming for a Circle IPO valuation in the impressive range of $4 billion to $5 billion. This isn’t Circle’s first rodeo with the public markets; they previously attempted to go public via a SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) deal in 2021, which unfortunately fell through. However, this renewed effort comes at a time when IPO market conditions are showing signs of improvement, and crucially, as regulatory tailwinds begin to favor the stablecoin sector. Here’s a quick rundown of the key details surrounding the Circle IPO : Timeline: Expected IPO filing by late April. Valuation Target: $4 billion to $5 billion. Financial Backing: JPMorgan and Citibank are reportedly assisting with the IPO. Previous Attempt: Second attempt at going public after a failed SPAC deal in 2021. Market Context: Improved IPO market conditions and positive regulatory developments for stablecoins. Why a USDC IPO Now? Decoding the Timing Why is Circle choosing this moment for a USDC IPO ? Several factors seem to be converging to create a favorable environment. Firstly, after a period of market volatility and uncertainty that dampened IPO activity, the overall market sentiment appears to be cautiously optimistic. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly for Circle, is the increasing clarity and momentum around Stablecoin Regulation in the United States. Let’s break down these factors: Improved IPO Market Conditions: Investor appetite for IPOs is gradually returning as economic outlook stabilizes. Regulatory Tailwinds: U.S. lawmakers are actively pushing forward with legislation to regulate stablecoins, which could provide much-needed clarity and legitimacy to the sector. This reduces regulatory uncertainty, making it a more attractive time for a stablecoin issuer like Circle to go public. USDC’s Growth and Market Position: USDC has solidified its position as a leading stablecoin, boasting significant market capitalization and widespread adoption. This strong foundation makes Circle an appealing prospect for investors. The Power of USDC: Driving Circle’s Valuation At the heart of Circle’s appeal is USDC, its flagship stablecoin. USDC plays a critical role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, acting as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset world. Its peg to the US dollar provides stability in the often-turbulent crypto markets, making it a preferred asset for trading, DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications, and remittances. The success and widespread adoption of USDC are undoubtedly key drivers behind Circle’s ambitious Circle Valuation target. Consider these points highlighting USDC’s significance: Stability and Trust: USDC is designed to be pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, offering users a stable and reliable digital currency. Widespread Adoption: USDC is integrated across numerous cryptocurrency exchanges, DeFi platforms, and payment systems. Transparency and Compliance: Circle emphasizes transparency and regulatory compliance, building trust within the crypto community and with regulators. Growing Market Cap: USDC consistently ranks among the top stablecoins by market capitalization, reflecting its strong market position. Cryptocurrency IPO Landscape: What Circle’s Move Signifies Circle’s potential IPO is not just significant for the company itself; it also holds broader implications for the entire Cryptocurrency IPO market. A successful IPO from a major player like Circle could signal a new era of maturity and acceptance for the crypto industry within traditional financial markets. It could pave the way for other crypto companies to consider going public, further legitimizing the asset class and attracting institutional investment. Here’s what Circle’s IPO could mean for the broader crypto space: Increased Legitimacy: A successful IPO from a prominent crypto company like Circle can enhance the overall legitimacy and credibility of the cryptocurrency industry. Attracting Institutional Investment: Publicly listed crypto companies can become more accessible to institutional investors who may have previously been hesitant to invest in private crypto ventures. Pathway for Other Crypto IPOs: Circle’s IPO could set a precedent and create a clearer pathway for other well-established crypto companies to pursue public listings. Mainstream Adoption: Greater institutional involvement and public market presence can contribute to the broader mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Navigating Regulatory Waters and Market Volatility While the outlook for Circle’s IPO appears promising, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges. Stablecoin Regulation Challenges remain a factor, as the specific regulatory framework in the U.S. is still evolving. Market volatility, inherent in the cryptocurrency space, could also impact investor sentiment and the IPO process. Circle will need to effectively navigate these factors to ensure a successful public listing. Key challenges to consider: Evolving Regulatory Landscape: While regulatory momentum is positive, the specifics of stablecoin regulation are still being defined, which could create uncertainty. Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility, which can impact investor confidence and IPO valuations. Competition: The stablecoin market is competitive, with USDC facing rivals like USDT (Tether) and others. Maintaining Transparency and Trust: As a public company, Circle will face increased scrutiny and expectations for transparency and compliance. Is a $5 Billion Valuation Justified? Assessing Circle’s Worth The targeted Circle Valuation of $4 billion to $5 billion is a significant figure. Investors will be closely scrutinizing Circle’s financials, growth prospects, and the overall potential of the stablecoin market to determine if this valuation is justified. Factors like USDC’s market share, revenue generation, and future expansion plans will play a crucial role in this assessment. Aspects influencing Circle’s valuation: USDC Market Share and Growth: USDC’s current market share and its potential for future growth are key valuation drivers. Revenue Streams: Understanding Circle’s revenue model, which may include transaction fees, interest on reserves, and other services, is essential. Expansion Plans: Circle’s strategies for expanding USDC’s adoption, entering new markets, and developing new products will influence its long-term valuation. Comparison to Peers: Analyzing the valuations of comparable fintech and crypto companies can provide context. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights Circle’s IPO is a landmark event for the crypto industry, and here’s what you should be paying attention to: Monitor IPO Developments: Stay informed about the progress of Circle’s IPO filing and the market response. Observe USDC’s Performance: Keep an eye on USDC’s market capitalization, adoption rates, and any developments related to its regulatory status. Consider the Broader Crypto Market: Circle’s IPO can be seen as a bellwether for the overall health and maturity of the cryptocurrency market. Stay Informed on Stablecoin Regulation: Track the progress of stablecoin regulation in the U.S. and globally, as it will significantly impact the stablecoin ecosystem. Conclusion: A Bold Step into the Future of Crypto Finance Circle’s daring move to pursue an IPO is a powerful signal of confidence in the future of cryptocurrency and stablecoins. If successful, it could mark a turning point, bridging the gap between the crypto world and traditional finance in a more profound way than ever before. As we watch this story unfold, one thing is clear: the cryptocurrency landscape is evolving rapidly, and Circle’s IPO is a development with the potential to reshape the industry for years to come.

But, it remains an incredibly exciting idea that has got a lot of people thinking. Were such a deal to go through, we would see a Web3 company rescue a Web2 company, which would have enormous ramifications in and of itself. Web2 tech giants are already being challenged in the area of AI by much smaller, nimble, and more flexible companies. However, the purchase of what was once one of Silicon Valley’s shiniest stars by a blockchain upstart would be a total paradigm shift. Beyond that, a deal would be a win for public understanding for data security and privacy. While we have all been vaguely aware of how Meta, Google, Apple, etc., take and use our data, we have chosen to ignore that for the convenience it affords us. Then there has perhaps never been such a case as 23andMe, which holds DNA and other data for 15 million people. It shows the public how vulnerable their most personal and intimate data is in the hands of centralized companies and organizations. It’s one thing when Facebook and Instagram are tracking our shopping and consumer habits and making our sensitive messages and emails vulnerable to leaks. With 23andMe, we’re talking DNA data; the very fabric of our human bodies has just been green-flagged for sale to the highest bidder. If Sei is not successful, which is most likely, this data can and may well be sold to health or life insurance companies. They may then be able to use this data to potentially exclude people from vital healthcare or insurance policies, thanks to the questionable way in which the U.S. healthcare system is run and its discrimination policies enforced. Perhaps, finally, this is a turning point at which the public may seriously come to understand the importance of owning their own data. Maybe more people will realize that to keep their data truly safe, they have full control of it themselves through the use of decentralized blockchain technology. Of course, not every blockchain is created equal. However, Sei certainly claims to be highly secure, and projects like Arweave – which is a permanent storage chain built on a “pay one store forever” model – have applications that can allow you to upload and store your data privately, securely and permanently. These are two among a growing list of options in our industry, but the point is this: there is simply no centralized solution beyond a piece of paper stored in a Swiss security deposit box with keys buried deep in the ground that can compare. And even then, someone can dig those keys up. This is a watershed moment for people to understand the importance of data self-sovereignty. And it comes at a time when trust in centralized organizations, companies, and even governments is breaking down. As such, the 23andMe sale could mark a true turning point in history, and one that could reshape how Web3 is seen, understood and utilized.",Opinion,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|TECHNOLOGY|AR,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-31 21:05:09

42715983,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144814,1743455440,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Shocking Ban: Brazil Blocks Crypto Investments for Pension Funds,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/brazil-crypto-ban-pension-funds/,"In a dramatic turn for the Latin American crypto landscape, Brazil’s National Monetary Council has issued a significant ruling that sends ripples through the digital asset world. A new resolution has officially blocked closed pension funds (EFPCs) from allocating investments to the volatile realm of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This decisive move, reported by CoinDesk, underscores growing global concerns surrounding the financial risks associated with digital currencies, especially when it comes to safeguarding retirement savings. But what does this Brazil crypto ban really mean for pension funds and the broader crypto market? Why the Sudden Brazil Crypto Ban on Pension Funds? The core reason behind this regulatory clampdown boils down to risk. Resolution 5.202/2025, the legal instrument enacting this Brazil crypto ban , explicitly cites concerns about the inherent volatility and speculative nature of cryptocurrencies. For closed pension funds (EFPCs), which manage retirement savings for a defined group of employees or members, the priority is capital preservation and steady, predictable growth. The wild price swings often seen in the crypto market are deemed incompatible with this fiduciary responsibility. Here’s a breakdown of the key factors driving this decision: Volatility Concerns: Bitcoin and altcoins are notorious for their price fluctuations. A sudden market downturn could significantly erode the value of pension fund investments, jeopardizing retirees’ financial security. Lack of Regulatory Clarity: While the crypto space is evolving, global regulatory frameworks are still catching up. The perceived lack of mature regulation and oversight adds to the risk profile for institutional investors like pension funds. Protection of Pensioners: The Brazilian government, through the National Monetary Council, is prioritizing the protection of pensioners’ savings. They view cryptocurrencies as too risky for these funds at this stage. Focus on Traditional Assets: Closed pension funds are generally expected to invest in more traditional and regulated asset classes like bonds, stocks, and real estate, which are considered less speculative. Understanding Closed Pension Funds and Crypto Investments It’s crucial to understand the specific scope of this pension funds crypto restriction. The ruling applies exclusively to ‘closed’ or ‘EFPCs’ pension funds. These are distinct from ‘open’ pension funds and individual retirement products, which are not currently subject to the same ban. Let’s clarify the distinction: Feature Closed Pension Funds (EFPCs) Open Pension Funds Membership Restricted to employees of a specific company or group, or members of an association. Open to the general public. Anyone can invest. Regulation in Brazil Subject to Resolution 5.202/2025 – Brazil crypto ban applies. Not currently subject to the same crypto investment restrictions. Risk Tolerance (Generally) Typically lower risk tolerance due to fiduciary duty to a defined group of beneficiaries. Potentially higher risk tolerance, depending on the individual investor’s profile. This distinction is vital. While closed pension funds in Brazil are now prohibited from crypto investments , the door remains open for other types of investment vehicles and individual investors to engage with the digital asset market. This targeted approach suggests a cautious but not outright dismissive stance from Brazilian regulators towards cryptocurrency. Impact on the Crypto Market and Bitcoin Regulation in Brazil What are the potential ramifications of this Bitcoin regulation Brazil for the broader crypto market, both domestically and internationally? Reduced Institutional Investment Flow: Closed pension funds represent a significant pool of capital. Their exclusion from the crypto market will undoubtedly reduce potential institutional investment inflows into Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies within Brazil. Precedent for Other Regions? Brazil’s move could set a precedent for other countries, particularly in Latin America and emerging markets, who are grappling with how to regulate crypto and manage risks within their financial systems. Other nations might consider similar restrictions for pension funds or other risk-averse institutional investors. Focus on Retail and Open Funds: The Brazilian crypto market may become even more reliant on retail investors and open pension funds. This could potentially lead to increased market volatility and a greater need for investor education and protection measures. Dialogue with Regulators: This Brazil crypto ban may spur further dialogue between the crypto industry and Brazilian regulators. Industry players might need to work proactively to demonstrate risk mitigation strategies and advocate for clearer, more nuanced regulations that could eventually allow for institutional participation in a controlled manner. Navigating the New Landscape: What’s Next for Crypto in Brazil? Despite this setback for institutional crypto investments from closed pension funds, the cryptocurrency scene in Brazil remains dynamic. It’s important to remember that this ruling is not a blanket ban on crypto within the country. Here’s what to watch out for: Evolution of Open Pension Fund Regulations: Will Brazilian regulators extend similar restrictions to open pension funds in the future? This is a key question for the industry to monitor. Development of Crypto Regulation Frameworks: Brazil, like many nations, is still developing its comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. This Bitcoin regulation Brazil for pension funds could be a stepping stone towards broader legislation. Growth of Retail Crypto Adoption: Brazil has a significant and growing retail crypto market. This segment is likely to continue expanding, potentially driven by factors like inflation concerns and the desire for alternative investment options. Innovation in Crypto Products: The crypto industry in Brazil may focus on developing products and services tailored to retail investors and open funds, while also seeking ways to address regulatory concerns and potentially re-engage with closed pension funds in the long term through safer, regulated instruments. Conclusion: A Calculated Pause, Not a Full Stop Brazil’s decision to block crypto investments for closed pension funds is undoubtedly a significant development, reflecting a cautious approach to managing financial risk within the retirement savings sector. While this Brazil crypto ban may be viewed as a setback by some in the crypto industry, it’s crucial to understand it as a targeted measure focused on a specific type of institutional investor. The broader crypto landscape in Brazil remains open and active. The future of crypto in Brazil will likely hinge on continued dialogue between regulators and the industry, the evolution of global regulatory standards, and the ongoing development of risk-mitigating strategies within the digital asset space. This isn’t the end of the crypto story in Brazil, but rather a pivotal chapter that emphasizes the need for responsible and regulated growth.

Stacks Price Prediction and the Future of the ASIA,https://thecoinrise.com/is-qubetics-the-best-crypto-to-buy-now-with-15-5m-stacks-price-prediction-and-the-future-of-the-asia/,"Crypto enthusiasts, buckle up! The market in 2025 is shaping up to be incredibly dynamic, with some jaw-dropping projects on the horizon. If you’re looking for the best crypto to buy now , three names have been creating waves in the space: Qubetics, Stacks, and the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance. Each one offers something unique, catering to different aspects of the blockchain ecosystem, from asset tokenization to scaling smart contracts and AI-driven solutions. At the forefront of this exciting market is Qubetics ($TICS), an emerging crypto project with serious potential to change the game with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. This platform redefines how businesses, professionals, and individuals interact with blockchain. Meanwhile, Stacks is focused on bringing Bitcoin into the world of smart contracts, allowing users to build decentralized apps (dApps) and smart contracts while maintaining Bitcoin’s security. And let’s not forget the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance—an ambitious project pushing the boundaries of AI and blockchain integration, promising to transform industries with AI-powered solutions. But here’s where it gets exciting: Qubetics isn’t just another crypto token; it’s solving real-life problems that its predecessors couldn’t reasonably address. Whether you’re new to the scene or an experienced crypto player, you’ll want to watch these three projects, especially as they make moves in 2025. Let’s dive deep into each project and explore what makes them tick and why they could be the best crypto to buy now. Qubetics ($TICS): Real-World Asset Tokenization Redefined Regarding groundbreaking concepts in blockchain, Qubetics is setting the bar high. It’s not just about another cryptocurrency or DeFi project—it’s about solving real-world problems through tokenizing physical assets. The Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace is a revolutionary step in how businesses, professionals, and individuals can interact with blockchain to buy, sell, or transfer ownership of assets like real estate, intellectual property, or commodities. The Qubetics crypto presale is in its 28th stage, with over 504 million tokens sold to more than 23,900 holders. The project has raised over $15.5 million, and $TICS tokens are priced at $0.14301 in the ongoing presale. Analysts’ Future Predictions Current $TICS Price: $0.1430 per token At $1 after presale: 599% ROI At $5 after presale: 3396% ROI At $15 after mainnet launch: 10,388% ROI This kind of potential is hard to ignore; many are already calling it the best crypto to buy now. What makes Qubetics stand out from other blockchain projects is its focus on tokenizing real-world assets. Instead of dealing with abstract financial products or digital assets alone, Qubetics bridges the gap between the physical and digital worlds. By offering a secure and transparent way to tokenize physical assets, Qubetics is making it easier than ever for individuals and businesses to access liquidity that would otherwise be locked away in physical forms. The vision behind Qubetics isn’t just about making money—it’s about creating a system that helps people unlock new ways to leverage their physical assets. It’s about democratizing access to wealth-building opportunities, making the process more transparent, secure, and efficient than ever before. And with $TICS tokens in presale, getting in early might just be the smartest move if you’re looking for big returns in the near future. Real-World Asset Tokenization Marketplace One of the most revolutionary concepts in blockchain right now is the tokenization of real-world assets. This process involves converting physical assets, like real estate, commodities, or even intellectual property, into digital tokens that can be traded on the blockchain. Tokenization opens up new opportunities for businesses and individuals alike, offering faster, more secure, and more transparent ways to transfer ownership of physical assets. Qubetics is leading the charge in this space with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace. The idea is simple: by creating digital representations of physical assets, Qubetics makes it easier for people to access liquidity and trade assets that would otherwise be difficult to sell or transfer. This is especially valuable in industries like real estate, where the process of buying and selling can be slow and cumbersome. With tokenization, transactions can be completed in a fraction of the time, with more security and transparency built in. The beauty of this system lies in its simplicity. Instead of dealing with traditional intermediaries or cumbersome paperwork, asset tokenization allows for seamless, peer-to-peer transactions. Whether you’re a business looking to tokenize your real estate portfolio or an individual hoping to unlock liquidity from an art collection, the Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace is designed to make these processes faster, easier, and more secure than ever. Stacks: Bringing Bitcoin to the Smart Contract Revolution Stacks is one of the most interesting projects in the crypto space, especially for those who are passionate about Bitcoin. Bitcoin, as the world’s first cryptocurrency, has always been celebrated for its security, but its lack of smart contract functionality has left it trailing behind other blockchains in terms of decentralization and flexibility. That’s where Stacks comes in. Stacks is essentially a layer-2 blockchain that brings smart contract functionality to Bitcoin, enabling developers to build decentralized apps (dApps) while utilizing Bitcoin’s unmatched security and decentralization. This makes Stacks a unique project in that it connects Bitcoin’s robustness with the flexibility of smart contracts, something Bitcoin itself wasn’t originally designed to do. In terms of Stacks price prediction, there’s a lot of excitement surrounding its growth. The demand for Bitcoin-based dApps and smart contracts will likely increase as the platform continues to develop and expand. With major advancements expected in 2025, many analysts believe that Stacks has the potential to see significant price appreciation. The project’s vision is clear: it’s about giving Bitcoin a new lease on life and making it more useful in today’s rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem. Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance: A New Frontier in AI and Blockchain The Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance is an ambitious project that blends the world of AI with blockchain to revolutionize industries. This is not just another crypto project—it’s about pushing the limits of what AI can do in the context of blockchain. The alliance is focused on creating AI-powered decentralized solutions for everything from finance to healthcare to supply chain management. What makes the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance so exciting is its potential to automate and optimize processes that were once thought to be impossible. By combining the decentralized, secure, and transparent nature of blockchain with the capabilities of advanced artificial intelligence, this project could change how you approach problem-solving in a wide range of industries. Whether it’s improving healthcare delivery, making financial systems more efficient, or enhancing decision-making processes, AI-powered blockchain solutions could be the next big thing in crypto and beyond. The intersection of AI and blockchain could lead to groundbreaking solutions in industries that have traditionally been slow to adopt digital transformation. AI has enormous potential to streamline operations, improve accuracy, and reduce inefficiencies in these sectors. As AI continues to evolve and blockchain technology becomes more integrated into various industries, the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance could play a central role in shaping the future of business. Conclusion: Why 2025 Is the Year to Keep an Eye on These Cryptos 2025 will be a monumental year for blockchain and crypto, with projects like Qubetics , Stacks, and the Artificial Super Intelligence Alliance leading the charge.

WIF could reach a maximum price of $3.98 by the end of 2028. By 2031, WIF’s price may surge to $6.46. Remember Dogecoin and Shiba Inu? The popular dog-themed memecoins! Dogwifhat (WIF) is another dog-inspired memecoin built on the Solana blockchain. Despite being relatively new on the market (launched in November 2023), the “dog wif a hat” project saw remarkable success post-launch. Following the exchange listing of the token on Binance and the popular “Sphere Wif Hat” campaign that led to the crowdfunding of over 690,000 USDC, the value of WIF surged, temporarily usurping PEPE coin in late March 2024 to rank as the 3rd largest memecoin behind Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Having no utility, the success of Dogwifhat (WIF) has birthed other spinoffs, Catwifhat, Simbawifhat, Wenwifhat, and Bonkwifhat, with more hat-wearing dog memecoins hitting the market afterwards. Dogwifhat has thus far recorded significant feats in terms of valuation and exchange listing. The token approached the $5 mark on March 31, 2024 ($4.58B market cap), saw massive price movements after the November U.S. elections, and got listed on Binance US, Coinbase, KuCoin, Robinhood, and more. However, a massive bear market ensued, and WIF lost momentum. Leaving investors asking: How high can dogwifhat crypto go? Let’s explore the current market sentiments and the possibilities of WIF reaching new all-time highs (ATHs).

The inflows of stablecoins into Binance went vertical in the last months of 2024, but slower growth continued in the first quarter of 2024. Despite the market slowdown, the supply of stablecoins remains high, and the assets are waiting on the sidelines for an opportunity to trade. Stablecoins expanded as a way to lower risk. During this market cycle, the supply of stablecoins is growing, even as the crypto market suffers a 30% drawdown from the peak.

Spot exchanges attracted a much smaller share of stablecoin turnover, as most of the activity depended on leveraged positions for BTC and ETH. Stablecoin inflows boost derivative trading The total supply of stablecoins on exchanges reached 45B tokens of various types, with USDT and USDC still the most common. Binance carries over 33B tokens, including its centrally controlled FDUSD. Binance has a total of $3.38B in USDC, $29.4B in USDT, and another $1.5B in FDUSD. The exchange also carries the most active trading pair for USDT, with $1.67B in 24-hour volumes.

The shift has not affected the general inflow of tokens. Binance still achieves over $17B in daily trading volumes, boosted by the value of the native BNB token and multiple stablecoin markets. The market is also carrying 5.34% of all USDC trading, having the most active trading pair against BTC. The recent inflow of stablecoins mostly boosts the liquidity of derivative BTC markets, as well as spot markets. The inflow to centralized exchanges follows the general expansion of stablecoins to over 229B tokens, depending on which assets are counted. Most of the stablecoins are dollar-pegged, with around $2B in alternative currencies. Stablecoins are one of Binance’s key reserve assets. The exchange carries over $133B in total assets, based on its transparency report. USDT reserves are at 104% of user claims. The USDC market is even more over-supplied, with 161% of user claims. The excess reserves grow with fees, liquidation fees, and other user-based payments. Binance also remains the leading centralized exchange by assets, carrying the most significant share of derivative open interest. BNB Smart Chain carries 7B in stablecoins The decentralized Binance ecosystem carries over 7B in bridged or native stablecoins. The chain is the fourth-largest network with a growing stablecoin supply. Over 53% of all stablecoins are still on Ethereum. ERC-20 stablecoins are also the ones most often deposited into Binance. TRON carries over 28% of the total supply, while Solana has over 10B in USDC, or 5.4% of the total supply . The three major stablecoins, USDT, USDC, and FDUSD on BNB Chain make up around 5.9B of the supply, up over 2.2B in the past 12 months. The remaining balance is for other smaller bridged stablecoins. BNB Smart Chain is used for simple transfers and payments through stablecoins. USDT transfers make more than $4.5B , around $500M moves through USDC, and FDUSD has daily transfers of around $60M. Most of the senders on BNB Smart Chain prefer USDT, the main source of liquidity for payments or decentralized swaps. For now, the growth of the BNB Smart Chain decentralized ecosystem lags behind the success of Binance’s derivative market. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

With daily trading volumes having reached $4 billion, the exchange has become the largest decentralized (DEX) derivatives platform, commanding nearly 60% of the market. Hyperliquid still lags far behind Binance Futures’ $50 billion daily average volume, but the trend suggests that it has started to encroach on centralized exchange (CEX) territory. What’s behind Hyperliquid’s parabolic rise? Launched in 2023, Hyperliquid gained popularity in April 2024 after launching spot trading. This, combined with its aggressive listing strategy and easy-to-use onchain user interface, helped to lure in a wave of new users. The platform’s real explosion, however, came in November 2024, following the launch of its HYPE (HYPE) token. Hyperliquid’s trading volume skyrocketed, and it now boasts over 400,000 users and more than 50 billion trades processed, according to data from Dune . Hyperliquid cumulative trades and users. Source: Dune While Hyperliquid started as a high-performance perpetual futures and spot DEX, its ambitions have since expanded. With the launch of HyperEVM on Feb. 18, the project has become a general-purpose layer-1 chain capable of supporting third-party DeFi apps built on top of its infrastructure. As one of Hyperliquid’s founders, Jeff Yan, put it, “Most L1s build infrastructure and hope that others will come build the killer apps. Hyperliquid takes the opposite approach: polish a native application and then grow into general-purpose infrastructure.” If this approach works, the liquidity driven by Hyperliquid’s core DEX could naturally feed into the broader ecosystem and vice versa, creating a flywheel effect. Related: Hyperliquid flips Solana in fees, but is the ‘HYPE’ justified? Will Hyperliquid become a sustainable CEX alternative? According to CoinGecko , Hyperliquid now ranks 14th among derivatives exchanges by open interest, sitting at $3.1 billion. That’s still behind Binance’s $22 billion but ahead of older names like Deribit or derivatives divisions of Crypto.com, BitMEX, or KuCoin. It’s the first time a DEX is competing so closely with established CEXs. Furthermore, as Hyperliquid deepens its focus on specialized trading pairs, it continues to chip away at the market share of major exchanges. The DEX accepts not only Arbitrum USDC as collateral but also native BTC. This makes it one of the few decentralized platforms that handle BTC wrapping and unwrapping natively, giving users the option to use BTC for Web3-wallet-based trading. X user Skewga.hl noted that Hyperliquid’s BTC perpetual futures volume share recently hit an all-time high, reaching almost 50% of Bybit’s and 21% of Binance’s. Skewga.hl wrote, “No DEX has ever come this close to matching Tier 1 CEX volume.” Daily volume ratios, Hyperliquid vs Other exchanges (BTC perp). Source: Skewga.hl Since 2024, perpetual swaps have seen a revival as a trading tool. During the 2021–2022 bull market, daily perps volume averaged around $5 billion. In early 2025, that number often exceeded $15 billion, with Hyperliquid accounting for nearly two-thirds of it. Data from DefiLlama illustrates the shift: while dYdX (green) dominated in 2023–2024, the landscape diversified significantly in 2024—and by 2025, Hyperliquid (pink) had taken the lead.

It has yet to capture institutional investor flows or scale to the level of top-tier CEXs. However, if its layer 1 ecosystem gains traction with developers, Hyperliquid could evolve into more than just a leading DEX. This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The world of artificial intelligence just got a whole lot more visually stunning. Runway, a leading AI startup, has dropped a bombshell: Runway Gen-4 , their brand-new video-generating AI model, and it’s poised to redefine what’s possible in the digital realm. Forget clunky, unrealistic AI videos – Gen-4 is here to deliver fidelity and control like never before, potentially shaking up industries from Hollywood to content creation. What Makes Runway Gen-4 a Game Changer in AI Video Generation? Runway is boldly claiming that Gen-4 is a leap forward in AI video generation , and the initial glimpses certainly suggest they’re not exaggerating. Here’s what sets this new model apart and why it’s generating so much buzz: Consistency is King: Imagine generating scenes with the same characters, locations, and objects, maintaining visual continuity throughout your video. Gen-4 is designed to do just that, ensuring a cohesive and immersive viewing experience. World-Building Prowess: Creating believable and consistent environments is crucial for video narratives. Runway emphasizes Gen-4’s ability to maintain “coherent world environments,” making AI-generated scenes feel more real and less jarring. Perspective Play: Need to show an object or character from a different angle? Gen-4 can regenerate elements from various perspectives and positions within scenes, offering creators greater flexibility and control over their visual storytelling. Style and Subject Mastery: Want to create videos in a specific artistic style or featuring particular subjects and locations? Runway Gen-4 can utilize visual references combined with instructions to achieve consistent styles, subjects, and locations without extensive fine-tuning. Dynamic Motion and Realism: According to Runway, Gen-4 excels in generating highly dynamic videos with realistic motion. This is a significant step up from previous models, promising more fluid and natural-looking AI-generated content. Prompt Power: Superior prompt adherence means Gen-4 is better at understanding and executing user instructions, translating your creative vision into reality with greater accuracy. Runway itself stated in a blog post that Gen-4 represents a “significant milestone in the ability of visual generative AI models to simulate real-world physics.” This isn’t just about creating pretty visuals; it’s about pushing the boundaries of what AI can understand and replicate about our physical world. Runway Gen-4 vs. the Competition: Is it Really Top-Tier? The AI video generation landscape is heating up fast, with major players like OpenAI and Google vying for dominance. Runway, backed by tech giants like Salesforce, Google, and Nvidia, is determined to carve out its niche. While the specifics of model comparisons are still emerging, Runway highlights Gen-4 as a “marked improvement over Gen-3 Alpha” and emphasizes its superior capabilities in motion, consistency, and prompt adherence. Runway’s strategy to differentiate itself includes: Hollywood Connection: Runway has inked a deal with a major Hollywood studio, signaling its ambition to become a key player in the entertainment industry. AI Film Funding: Committing millions to fund films using AI-generated video demonstrates Runway’s belief in the transformative potential of its technology and its dedication to fostering creative applications. Use Cases and Creative Possibilities with Video-Generating AI The potential applications of video-generating AI like Gen-4 are vast and span across numerous industries. Here are just a few areas where this technology could make a significant impact: Filmmaking and Entertainment: From pre-visualization and storyboarding to creating entire scenes and special effects, Gen-4 could revolutionize film production, potentially lowering costs and accelerating timelines. Advertising and Marketing: Imagine rapidly generating customized video ads tailored to specific audiences, creating engaging content at scale and speed. Education and E-learning: Visual learning is powerful. Gen-4 could enable the creation of dynamic and engaging educational videos, making complex topics more accessible and understandable. Content Creation for Social Media: Social media thrives on video. Gen-4 could empower creators to produce high-quality, attention-grabbing video content more efficiently. Virtual and Augmented Reality: Creating immersive VR and AR experiences requires vast amounts of visual content. AI video generation can streamline content creation for these emerging platforms. The Ethical and Industry Impact: Is AI in Film a Double-Edged Sword? While the creative possibilities of AI in film industry are exciting, the rise of generative AI video tools also raises important questions and concerns, particularly regarding job displacement and copyright. Job Disruption in Hollywood: A 2024 study by the Animation Guild paints a concerning picture. It found that: 75% of film production companies using AI have reduced or eliminated jobs after adopting the technology. Estimates suggest over 100,000 U.S. entertainment jobs could be disrupted by generative AI by 2026. This highlights the very real threat that AI poses to traditional roles in the film and TV industry, prompting discussions about retraining, adaptation, and the future of work in creative fields. Copyright and Training Data Concerns: Runway, like many other AI companies, is tight-lipped about the sources of its training data. This opacity raises concerns about potential copyright infringement, especially given that these models are trained on vast datasets of existing videos. Runway is currently facing a lawsuit accusing it of training on copyrighted artwork without permission, arguing for “fair use” as legal cover. The outcome of this lawsuit could have significant implications for the entire generative AI industry. Runway’s $4 Billion Ambition and the Future of AI Video The stakes are high for Runway. The company is reportedly seeking a new funding round that could value it at a staggering $4 billion. With ambitious revenue targets and the launch of APIs for its video-generating AI models, Runway is betting big on the future of AI video. Whether it’s navigating legal challenges or outmaneuvering competitors, Runway’s journey will be a key indicator of the trajectory of generative AI in media and entertainment. Conclusion: A New Era of Visual Storytelling with Runway Gen-4? Runway Gen-4 is undeniably a significant leap forward in generative AI models for video. Its enhanced consistency, realism, and control open up exciting new avenues for creative expression and industry innovation. However, alongside the awe-inspiring potential, we must also grapple with the ethical and societal implications of this powerful technology. As AI video generation continues to evolve, it will be crucial to address concerns about job displacement, copyright, and responsible AI development to ensure a future where this technology benefits creators and society as a whole.

In a recent move, the firm filed a motion in the D.C. District Court to resume its Freedom of Information Act lawsuit (FOIA) against the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) over Operation Chokepoint 2.0. SEC and FDIC in Legal Tussle With Coinbase Coinbase has accused the agency of intentionally withholding crucial documents. The digital asset service provider says the FDIC and even the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fail to fully cooperate with its information requests, including obtaining records of the FDIC’s communications with financial institutions over cryptocurrency activities. Markedly, Coinbase is very particular about the so-called “pause letters” that the FDIC sent to banks, instructing them to halt crypto-related services. This lack of clarity has frustrated Coinbase and motivated it to intensify its fight to expose what it sees as unfair targeting of the crypto industry. Coinbase is Still Dissatisfied With FDIC In February, the exchange held off on the lawsuit against the agency. This was when President Donald Trump appointed Travis Hill as acting FDIC chairman. Speaking to the matter on the ground, Hill pledged to enhance the FDIC’s transparency beyond FOIA requirements. Many believed the matter would be resolved outside of court on this premise. However, the recent Coinbase move suggests otherwise. According to Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, there is an ongoing dissatisfaction with the FDIC’s transparency. At first, he acknowledged that the agency’s cooperation had improved under Hill’s leadership. Still, he does not think that it is sufficient. FDIC Lifts Restrictions on Crypto Banking The new agency leadership has implemented changes, including lifting the restrictions on crypto banking . It has overturned a 2022 policy that required financial institutions to request government approval before engaging in cryptocurrency activities. By taking this approach, the FDIC seeks to promote more seamless interaction between financial institutions and the digital assets sector. Concerns about fraud, volatility, and financial stability have prompted agencies to be cautious. This eventually resulted in banks cutting ties with crypto firms and accusations that regulators were deliberately pushing digital assets out of the traditional financial system. The lifting of the restriction may help change the narrative.

The MACD histogram displays a slight bullish divergence, hinting at upward momentum. If volume remains strong, WLD could continue its gradual rise, but if sellers regain control, a drop toward $0.90 is possible. Is Worldcoin a good investment? Worldcoin (WLD) shows strong technical support above $0.92, with indicators like EMAs and MACD signaling the potential for further gains. Growing adoption, exchange listings, and its vision for a global financial identity system add to its long-term appeal.

These advancements position Worldcoin as a forward-thinking investment in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Will Worldcoin recover? The current WLD’s price action shows volatility and a slight recovery, suggesting that the cryptocurrency may have the potential for recovery. However, future performance will depend on the crypto market conditions and investor sentiment. Will Worldcoin reach $5? According to long-term predictions, the Worldcoin price forecast expects WLD to reach $5 by 2028. Will Worldcoin reach $50? Reaching $50 for Worldcoin would be a significant challenge, as it would require substantial adoption, demand, and market growth. Given its current price and the broader cryptocurrency market dynamics, a jump to that level by 2025 seems unlikely without breakthroughs or widespread use Will Worldcoin reach $100? Worldcoin’s prediction shows that $100 is highly unlikely due to current market conditions, its present price levels, and the significant rise in market capitalization required. Such an increase would necessitate extraordinary growth and adoption. What will be the value of Worldcoin in 2025 Based on current trends and market conditions, Worldcoin’s average value is predicted to be $1.05, with the potential to reach a high of $2.58 by 2025. Does Worldcoin have a good long-term future? WLD coin is showing some recovery trend; the token may have a promising long-term future. Continued development, adoption, and favorable market trends will be crucial for its success.

Armstrong argues emphatically in favor, stating that this pivotal step, facilitated through clear stablecoin legislation, holds immense potential for both domestic and global financial landscapes. Let’s delve into why Armstrong believes this is a game-changer and explore the ripple effects it could create in the world of cryptocurrency and beyond. Why is Coinbase Pushing for Interest on Stablecoins? Brian Armstrong, a prominent voice in the crypto sphere and the head of one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Coinbase , isn’t just making noise; he’s advocating for a fundamental shift in how stablecoins are treated in the U.S. His recent article on X (formerly Twitter) outlines a compelling case for allowing interest to be earned on these digital assets. But why is this so important, and what are the core arguments behind this push? Armstrong’s stance boils down to three key pillars: Empowering U.S. Consumers: Imagine holding digital dollars that not only offer stability but also generate passive income. This is the potential benefit for everyday Americans. Global Financial Inclusion: With billions globally seeking stable access to the dollar, allowing interest on dollar-backed stablecoins could be revolutionary, especially in regions with volatile local currencies. Boosting the U.S. Economy: By fostering innovation and attracting capital, this move could significantly benefit the U.S. economic engine in the long run. These points aren’t just theoretical; they represent tangible advantages that could reshape the financial landscape. Let’s break down each of these benefits in more detail. Benefits for U.S. Consumers: A Financial Revolution? For the average American, the prospect of earning interest on stablecoins might sound abstract. However, the implications are quite real and potentially transformative. Consider this: Passive Income Generation: Instead of simply holding digital dollars, users could see their holdings grow over time, similar to traditional savings accounts but potentially with more competitive crypto yield rates. Accessibility and Inclusion: Stablecoins can be more accessible than traditional banking for some segments of the population. Earning interest on them could democratize access to wealth-building opportunities. Inflation Hedge: In an era of rising inflation, earning interest , even a modest amount, can help to offset the erosion of purchasing power. Think about Sarah, a freelance graphic designer in Ohio. She receives payments in stablecoins for her international clients. Currently, these stablecoins sit idle in her wallet. If regulations were to change, Sarah could potentially earn interest on these holdings, providing a supplementary income stream without needing to actively trade or invest in volatile assets. This is the kind of real-world impact Armstrong is envisioning. Global Impact: Dollar Stablecoins as Interest-Bearing Assets Armstrong’s vision extends far beyond U.S. borders. He highlights the immense global potential of dollar-backed stablecoins that earn interest . Why is this globally significant? Dollarization 2.0: In countries with unstable local currencies or limited access to USD, stablecoins offer a digital pathway to dollar exposure. Adding interest makes them even more attractive as a store of value and a tool for savings. Remittance Revolution: Imagine migrant workers sending remittances back home using stablecoins that earn interest while in transit and upon arrival. This could reduce costs and increase the value received by families. Financial Empowerment in Emerging Markets: For billions in developing economies, access to reliable financial services is limited. Interest -bearing stablecoins could offer a lifeline, enabling savings and participation in the global digital economy. Consider the example of Argentina, a country grappling with hyperinflation. Citizens are increasingly turning to stablecoins to preserve their wealth. If these stablecoins could generate interest , it would provide a significant buffer against inflation and enhance financial stability for ordinary Argentinians. This global dimension of crypto yield on stablecoins is a powerful argument in favor of regulatory change. Economic Boost for the U.S.: Innovation and Capital Inflow Beyond consumer and global benefits, Armstrong emphasizes the economic advantages for the U.S. How could allowing interest on stablecoins benefit the nation’s economy? Attracting Crypto Innovation: Clear and progressive US regulation regarding stablecoins and interest would signal that the U.S. is open for crypto business. This could attract innovative companies and talent to the U.S., fostering job creation and technological advancement. Capital Inflow and Investment: A favorable regulatory environment for stablecoins could attract significant capital investment into the U.S. crypto sector. This investment can fuel growth and innovation across the broader economy. Maintaining Financial Leadership: By embracing and regulating stablecoins effectively, the U.S. can solidify its position as a global leader in finance and technology, rather than ceding ground to other nations with more crypto-friendly policies. Think about the broader tech landscape. Nations that embraced the internet early on reaped significant economic benefits. Similarly, proactive and informed US regulation of stablecoins could position the U.S. at the forefront of the next wave of financial innovation, ensuring long-term economic prosperity. Navigating the Regulatory Landscape: Challenges and Considerations While the benefits are compelling, the path to allowing interest on stablecoins isn’t without its hurdles. What are some of the regulatory challenges and considerations that need to be addressed? Regulatory Clarity: The current regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. is still evolving. Clear and consistent US regulation is crucial to provide businesses and consumers with the certainty needed to operate and invest in stablecoins . Consumer Protection: Robust consumer protection measures are essential to mitigate risks associated with stablecoins and ensure that users are adequately informed about the potential downsides. Financial Stability Concerns: Regulators need to carefully assess the potential impact of interest -bearing stablecoins on the broader financial system and implement safeguards to maintain stability. Combating Illicit Activities: Effective measures are needed to prevent the use of stablecoins for illicit activities, while still fostering innovation and legitimate use cases. These challenges are not insurmountable. With thoughtful and proactive dialogue between industry leaders like Coinbase and policymakers, it is possible to create a regulatory framework that balances innovation, consumer protection, and financial stability. Brian Armstrong’s Call to Action: What’s Next? Brian Armstrong’s advocacy for interest on stablecoins is more than just a suggestion; it’s a call to action. He urges U.S. lawmakers to consider the immense potential benefits and to enact sensible stablecoin legislation that unlocks these opportunities. The ball is now in the court of policymakers to engage in constructive discussions and to craft regulations that are both forward-looking and responsible. The future of finance is increasingly digital, and stablecoins are poised to play a central role. Allowing interest on these digital dollars could be a pivotal step towards a more inclusive, innovative, and economically vibrant financial future for the U.S. and the world. It’s time to seriously consider Armstrong’s vision and explore the crypto yield potential of stablecoins .

Bill explains why Bitcoin is more than digital gold: it’s a response to engineered outcomes, financial entropy, and institutional inertia. He hits hard on why Michael Saylor and Strategy’s ‘strategy’ matters, why more corporations will follow, and why the time for fence-sitting on Bitcoin is over for investors of all-types. This should come as no surprise given comments on Bitcoin by his father Bill Miller III who revealed a “very big” Bitcoin position in 2022 after the cryptocurrency made up approximately half of his asset allocation. Drawing from over a decade of investing experience in the space, Bill walks through how Bitcoin solves fundamental failures in fiat monetary systems—not with hype, but with game theory, governance, and first-principle design. Bill offers a powerful endorsement of Bitcoin, noting: “I buy Bitcoin every single day. It’s the last thing I’d ever sell.” Follow along for a deep dive on how one of Bitcoin’s biggest bulls and longest-time investors is navigating the Bitcoin market in 2025 and beyond.

With several partnerships and innovations in the works, Hoskinson says Cardano is bracing itself to explore layer 2 solutions on the Bitcoin blockchain, Cardano Positions Itself For Bitcoin DeFi In an interview with Scott Melker, Cardano’s founder has revealed ambitious plans for the network to turbocharge Bitcoin’s adoption for DeFi applications. Hoskinson notes that large financial institutions will trigger a demand for Bitcoin DeFi given their fiduciary obligation to create yield. He notes that a Bitcoin ETF providing DeFi yields will trigger shareholders to demand similar yields. Hoskinson eyes a three-year timeframe for institutions to plant their feet in Bitcoin DeFi and UTXO DeFi. Hoskinson says Cardano will combine Hydra with the Bitcoin Lightning network and build a trustless recursive bridge between both networks. The founder adds that its Aiken programming language will enabled to write both Bitcoin and Cardano scripts. Furthermore, a partnership with Maestro, an infrastructure provider allowing Bitcoin integration with UTXO-based blockchain will provide a “turn-key experience” for users. “It’s still early days but we are making methodical progress every step of the way,” said Hoskinson. Hoskinson is moving on from his absence from the Crypto Summit at the White House, doubling down on technical innovation. He notes that the Bitcoin-focused plays by Cardano will not adversely affect the network’s road map. Is Bitcoin Ready For DeFi Applications? Hoskinson revealed in the interview that Bitcoin is ready for DeFi utility following the Taproot and the Lightning Network advancements. According to the founder, Taproot added programmability features to the Bitcoin network and Cardano will push the frontiers. He adds that Cardano will enable Bitcoin users to engage in DeFi transactions while transacting with only BTC. Hoskinson says a merger between Bitcoin is enough to make Cardano’s DeFi significantly larger than Ethereum and Solana combined. While the integration will send Cardano price soaring, ADA wallows at $0,6611 after losing 10% in a week. However, traders are targeting an ADA pump in May following the forming of a cyclical pattern. An analyst argues that a price rally to $10 is not a crazy prediction given a streak of solid fundamentals and partnerships for Cardano.

Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump’s sons have partnered with Hut 8 to launch a new mining firm and DeFi protocol SIR.trading lost $335,000 in a hack. Bitcoin could reduce dominance of US dollar — BlackRock The US dollar could lose its status as the world’s reserve currency to Bitcoin or other digital assets if the United States does not get its debt under control, according to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. Fink wrote in his Annual Chairman’s Letter to Investors that “decentralized finance is an extraordinary innovation” that makes “markets faster, cheaper, and more transparent.” But “that same innovation could undermine America’s economic advantage if investors begin seeing Bitcoin as a safer bet than the dollar.” According to Trading Economics, the US debt equaled 122.3% of the country’s gross domestic product in 2023. That is a considerably higher percentage than the 105% observed in 2018. Moody’s Ratings retains the US’s AAA credit rating but has downgraded its outlook to negative, indicating a possible future rating downgrade. In the letter, Fink says that “tokenization is democratization” with the technological innovation “enabling instant buying, selling, and transferring without cumbersome paperwork or waiting periods.” If every asset ends up being tokenized, Fink said, “it will revolutionize investing. Markets wouldn’t need to close. Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth.” Trump sons back new Bitcoin mining venture with Hut 8 Several members of US President Donald Trump’s family are backing a new venture to launch what aims to become the world’s largest Bitcoin mining firm. Hut 8, a digital asset mining and infrastructure company, announced on March 31 that it is acquiring a majority stake in American Bitcoin, formerly known as American Data Center. The firm was founded by a group of investors, including Trump’s sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump. Related: Bitcoin miner Hut 8 argues to toss ‘short and distort’ shareholder suit As part of the deal, American Bitcoin will take ownership of Hut 8’s Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining hardware. Donald Trump Jr. said that the entrepreneurs behind American Data Centers have backed their conviction in Bitcoin personally and through their businesses. The new venture “aims to become the world’s largest, most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner while building a robust strategic Bitcoin reserve,” the announcement said. Mining operations will remain under Hut 8’s compute segment but will operate through the American Bitcoin brand. Donald Trump Jr. added: “Mining it on favorable economics opens an even bigger opportunity. We’re excited to bring investors into that equation through a platform engineered to execute on this thesis and deliver real, tangible participation in Bitcoin’s growth.” DeFi protocol SIR.trading loses entire $355,000 TVL in “worst news” possible Ethereum-based DeFi protocol SIR.trading, also known as Synthetics Implemented Right, has been hacked, resulting in the loss of its entire total value locked (TVL) — $355,000 at the time of the attack. The March 30 hack was initially detected by blockchain security firms TenArmorAlert and Decurity , both of which posted warnings on X to alert users of the protocol. The protocol’s founder, known only as Xatarrer, described the hack as “the worst news a protocol could received [sic],” but suggested the team intends to try to keep the protocol going despite the setback. Source: SIR.trading Decurity described the hack as a “clever attack” that targeted a callback function used in the protocol’s “vulnerable contract Vault” which leverages Ethereum’s transient storage feature. According to Decurity, the attacker was able to replace the real Uniswap pool address used in this callback function with an address under the hacker’s control, allowing them to redirect the funds in the vault to their address. TenArmorAlert further explained that by repeatedly calling this callback function, the attacker was able to fully drain the protocol’s TVL.",Trump memecoin|Solana memecoin|TRUMP token|Solana|SOL|Nova Labs|SEC|Securities and Exchange Commission|crypto regulation|TRUMP rally|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AVAX|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|ICO|LINK|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SOL|TRADING|USDT|XRP|ZRX|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BNB|TON|USDC|ZK|WLD|ARKM,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-03-31 21:57:40

Currently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is catching serious attention for its innovative blockchain solutions and strong early adoption. The project is currently priced at $0.025 per token in phase 4 of its presale. The project has already raised over $5.8 million and has attracted more than 7500 holders within days. This could be your second chance at life-changing gains. Phase 5 prices will spike with 20% to $0.03 and holders joining at this stage stand a 140% ROI when it launches at $0.06. Mutuum Finance could hit $7.2 with a 12000% gain. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Traction Investors flock to Mutuum Finance due to its revolutionary decentralized finance model for crypto loans while decentralization funds its innovative financial services. The project maintains a rising momentum since it has raised over $5.8 million in investments and now attracts more than 7500 investors. The Phase 4 token price at $0.025 presents investors with a limited opportunity as an upcoming 20% price boost charts the completion of early investment entry. Potential investors who join during the presale period could earn 140% ROI since the token has defined a listing price at $0.06. As the Decentralized market grows, Mutuum Finance is leading the charge with its groundbreaking lending model and solid market positioning. The Mutuum Finance team is currently having its smart contract audited by CertiK, a crucial step in ensuring security and trust. Once finalized, the official audit report will be shared on their social media platforms. Transforming Crypto Lending with a Dual-Model System Mutuum Finance offers a modern lending platform that joins Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models for better access to assets as well as transparency and user empowerment. Through the Peer-to-Contract model users can add stablecoins to smart contract pools to earn passive income as they instantly allow borrowing access to platform users. Smart contracts manage automatic interest rate adjustments that provide enhanced earnings for lenders at reduced borrowing expenses. When people utilize the P2P model they create immediate lending relationships free of intermediaries that fulfill decentralization goals and let users exercise complete negotiation capabilities. Borrowers together with lenders operate in a system which offers complete transparency and efficiency to form custom agreements for loan transactions creating enhanced user-centric borrowing situations. The Mutuum Finance stablecoin functions on Ethereum by keeping stable prices through USD fund reservations. Financial transactions rely on this stablecoin system because it uses a resistant structure which prevents algorithmic stability problems. The combination of next-generation financial lending approaches with robust infrastructure elements enables Mutuum Finance to create the path for decentralized finance development. Giveaway Mutuum Finance continues to grow its community base through the provision of attractive monetary benefits. The giveaway campaign provides $10,000 MUTM tokens to 10 randomly selected winners throughout the program which has one million dollars in prizes. Simultaneously the new investor referral program exists to reward users for new investor acquisitions. Demographic participants gain access to unique staking pools in addition to governance privileges and update services which fosters extended commitment to the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing attention from analysts who previously predicted Solana’s massive rally, suggesting it could be the next big DeFi breakout. Priced at $0.025 in Phase 4 of its presale, MUTM has already raised $5.8 million from over 7,500 investors. With a 20% price increase coming in Phase 5 and a launch target of $0.06, early investors stand to gain 140% at launch.

However, while Bitcoin’s price action typically dominates crypto news, savvy investors are turning their attention toward a rising star: MAGACOIN FINANCE, which analysts predict could soon achieve a breakthrough of its own by hitting the much-anticipated $1 mark. Bitcoin’s Big Moment: Closing in on $80K Bitcoin , often considered the bellwether for crypto markets, has been enjoying a robust upward momentum, nearing the psychologically significant price of $80,000. Market watchers attribute this rally to renewed institutional interest, regulatory clarity in major markets, and continued global adoption. While Bitcoin’s approach toward $80,000 excites the crypto community, seasoned investors are asking: what’s next? Is Bitcoin’s rally sustainable at these levels, or will profit-taking trigger another correction? This uncertainty is prompting investors to diversify their crypto portfolios and search for hidden gems with explosive growth potential. MAGACOIN FINANCE Emerges as Investors’ New Favorite As investors ponder Bitcoin’s next move, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. Currently in its presale stage, MAGACOIN FINANCE is a project rapidly gaining momentum. Analysts project that MAGACOIN FINANCE will hit the crucial $1 milestone, generating considerable investor excitement and prompting significant early investment activity. MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing comparisons to early-stage investments in now-prominent crypto projects. Experts are praising its strategic tokenomics, transparent roadmap, and the strength of its expanding investor community, noting these as key factors behind its current momentum and optimistic outlook. The $1 Milestone: MAGACOIN’s Game-Changing Moment Reaching the $1 mark would be more than just a symbolic achievement for MAGACOIN FINANCE . It would represent a significant validation of its growing market presence and investor confidence, paving the way for even greater adoption and higher valuations in the near future. Cryptocurrency analysts predict that once MAGACOIN hits the $1 mark, the price could accelerate dramatically. Early investors are keenly aware of the tremendous upside potential and are positioning themselves accordingly, further fueling the presale frenzy. Bitcoin vs. MAGACOIN: A Tale of Two Cryptos While Bitcoin remains the reliable giant that anchors the crypto market, MAGACOIN FINANCE represents a fresh and compelling investment opportunity. Investors who missed Bitcoin’s early explosive growth view MAGACOIN FINANCE as a chance to secure substantial returns by investing in the project early. As Bitcoin hovers around its recent highs, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s presale momentum is surging, supported by optimistic market sentiment and robust investor demand. Analysts believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE’s climb toward $1 may happen quicker than most expect, driven by widespread enthusiasm and carefully executed market strategy. Why Investors Are Acting Now With Bitcoin nearing historic highs and MAGACOIN FINANCE quickly rising toward its pivotal $1 milestone, investors face a critical decision: secure MAGACOIN tokens now or risk missing out on potentially massive returns. As MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to draw unprecedented attention and achieve key milestones, investors have limited time to act before token prices increase further. The crypto market is notoriously fast-moving, and timing can mean everything. Right now, the timing favors MAGACOIN FINANCE investors as they anticipate the next major cryptocurrency success story.

This one has already turned heads with a 2,380% price jump, shooting up from $0.001 to $0.0248 during its ongoing presale. With more than $209.5 million raised and climbing, it’s quickly becoming one of the most talked-about coins of the year. And this isn’t just hype—it’s backed by progress. BlockDAG blends Proof-of-Work with DAG technology to allow lightning-fast transactions and scalability that actually works. Over 700,000 users are already mining BDAG through the X1 mobile app and Tap-to-Mine Telegram game. Meanwhile, over 200 dApps are currently in development on its network. Analysts are buzzing with predictions, claiming BDAG could reach $1 in 2025, offering a 3,932% return from today’s price. Add in its upcoming mainnet rollout and 10 centralized exchange listings, and the stage is set for a potential breakout. With adoption snowballing and features rolling out fast, BlockDAG isn’t just another presale—it’s quickly earning its spot among the top crypto gainers of 2025. If you’ve been waiting for a project with both hype and substance, this might be your last chance to get in early. 2. Polkadot (DOT): Connecting the Chains—and the Growth Polkadot isn’t new, but it’s heating up again as it strengthens cross-chain capabilities. Its unique parachain model allows different blockchains to communicate smoothly, which is becoming more valuable as the Web3 world expands. With recent enhancements like Bridge 1.4 and direct integration with MetaMask, DOT’s usability just keeps improving. The network’s refreshed staking dashboard is also drawing more activity. As adoption increases across chains, Polkadot is poised to benefit in a big way—and could see a solid price boost heading into 2025. 3. Solana (SOL): Speed and Scale With Serious Backing Solana is one of those names that keeps coming back—and for good reason. Its ability to handle thousands of transactions per second makes it perfect for high-volume use in DeFi, NFTs, and now AI applications. Nearly 8,000 developers joined the Solana ecosystem in 2024 alone, a massive vote of confidence. Events like the SendAi hackathon continue to push creative development, while major collaborations keep building the ecosystem. If you’re betting on a project with real staying power and growth, Solana should be high on your list of top crypto gainers. 4. Cosmos (ATOM): Bridging Blockchains and Unlocking Potential Cosmos is on a mission to simplify multi-chain development—and it’s working. Its tools make it easier for different chains to connect and share data, a crucial step for the next generation of blockchain apps. Recent successes like IBC transfers with Starknet and zero-fee limit orders on Osmosis are turning heads. With more privacy features in development and increased traction across dApp builders, Cosmos is clearly preparing for the next leg up. It’s a sleeper pick for those watching long-term growth stories unfold. Which of These Top Crypto Gainers Will You Pick? Each of these projects brings something powerful to the table. Solana brings unmatched speed, Polkadot connects networks with ease, and Cosmos is laying the groundwork for the cross-chain future. But BlockDAG is the wild card that’s moving fast and hitting milestones at record speed. With $209.5M raised, 10 exchange listings around the corner, and a mainnet launch on the way, it’s not just climbing the charts—it’s charging toward the top. At just $0.0248, and with price targets as high as $1 in 2025, BDAG is being tipped as one of the top crypto gainers of the year. Skip it now, and you might be watching from the sidelines when it hits the next leg up.

The reassessment follows the firm’s second upward revision in March to its 2025 US tariff expectations, signaling an increasingly fraught macroeconomic environment with direct implications for risk assets — including cryptocurrencies. In the note titled “US Economics Analyst: A Further Increase in Our Tariff Assumptions”, Goldman economists Alec Phillips, Tim Walker, and David Mericle outline their rationale: “We now expect the average US tariff rate to rise 15pp in 2025 almost the entire revision reflects a more aggressive assumption for ‘reciprocal’ tariffs.” Goldman anticipates that President Trump will announce across-the-board reciprocal tariffs averaging 15% on April 2. Adjusted for product and country exclusions, the effective rise in average tariffs is expected to be around 9 percentage points. Related Reading: Crypto Market Cap Evolution Shows Diverging Trends Among Top Digital Asset The impact on the macro outlook is stark: Goldman has downgraded its 2025 US GDP growth forecast by 0.5pp to 1.0% (Q4/Q4), lifted its year end core PCE inflation forecast to 3.5% (+0.5pp), and increased its unemployment projection to 4.5% (+0.3pp). These revisions reflect a stagnating growth environment paired with inflationary pressures — a combination that constrains monetary stimulus options. The bank attributes the rise in recession probability to three key factors: a lower growth baseline; deteriorating household and business confidence; and “statements from White House officials indicating greater willingness to tolerate near-term economic weakness.” Despite historically poor predictive power from sentiment measures, Goldman writes: “We are less dismissive of the recent decline because economic fundamentals are not as strong as in prior years. Most importantly, real income growth has already slowed sharply and we expect it to average only 1.4% this year.” Implications For Crypto While digital assets have long been viewed as uncorrelated to traditional macroeconomic variables, that narrative has evolved. Bitcoin, in particular, has become increasingly responsive to broader macro conditions — particularly liquidity, risk sentiment, and real yields. Related Reading: Meltem Demirors On Crypto Rally: ‘Are We So Back? Not So Fast’ As the yield curve inverts once again — a classic recession signal — macro analysts are warning of a unique policy dilemma. As @ecoinometrics noted on X: “The yield curve is inverting again, a traditional recession signal. But unlike past cycles, the Fed is unlikely to rush to QE due to inflation concerns. This creates a double challenge for Bitcoin: potential risk-off pressure without the stimulus relief that typically follows. Bitcoin is very much driven by macro these days. It is behaving like a high-beta play on the NASDAQ 100.” However, not everyone agrees that a recession poses a net-negative risk for crypto. In a recent interview, Robbie Mitchnick, Global Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, offered a nuanced view of Bitcoin’s macro sensitivity: “Economic fears. I mean, I don’t know if we have a recession or not, but a recession would be a big catalyst for Bitcoin […] It’s catalyzed by more fiscal spending and debt and deficit accumulation. That happens in a recession. It’s catalyzed by lower interest rates and monetary stimulus. That tends to happen in a recession.” Mitchnick acknowledges the short-term constraints — the wealth effect, reduced disposable income, and high correlations with equities — but maintains that structurally, Bitcoin benefits from the long-term consequences of recessionary policy responses. “Bitcoin is long liquidity in the system… and to some extent over just fears of general social disorder […] that too, unfortunately, is something that can come up in a recession.” He adds that current market reactions may not reflect Bitcoin’s true positioning: “The market has almost, it seems, gotten this in some ways not particularly well calibrated… but that’s where the opportunity comes in for education in a market and an asset class that’s still very nascent.” At press time, BTC traded at $83,230.

42717849,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144872,1743458434,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Urgent Alert: Coinbase Delists Maple (MPL) – Crucial Migration to SYRUP Explained,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-delists-maple-mpl/,"Heads up, crypto enthusiasts! If you’re holding Maple (MPL) on Coinbase, you need to take immediate action. Coinbase has just announced a significant update: they are delisting MPL across all their platforms on April 30th. This isn’t just another routine delisting; it’s tied to Maple’s exciting transition to a brand-new token, SYRUP. Let’s dive into what this means for you and how to ensure you don’t miss out. Why is Coinbase Delisting MPL? The primary reason behind Coinbase’s decision to Coinbase delist MPL is the token’s planned migration. Maple, the project behind MPL, is transitioning to a new token called SYRUP. This migration is set to conclude on April 30th, the same day Coinbase will cease trading for MPL. It’s a strategic move by Maple to potentially enhance their ecosystem, possibly with improved functionalities or a refined tokenomics model. For exchanges like Coinbase, supporting a token that is being phased out no longer aligns with their operational priorities. Therefore, the Coinbase MPL delisting is a direct consequence of this token migration. Understanding the MPL to SYRUP Migration The MPL to SYRUP migration is a critical process for all MPL holders. Think of it as upgrading from an older version of software to a newer, more advanced one. Maple is essentially evolving, and SYRUP is the next generation token. This transition is not automatic on centralized exchanges like Coinbase. You, as an MPL holder on Coinbase, need to actively participate in this migration to convert your MPL tokens into SYRUP. Maple has set up an official migration portal to facilitate this process. Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know about the Maple token migration : Migration Deadline: April 30th. This is a hard deadline. Ensure you complete your migration before this date to avoid potential issues. Migration Method: Via Maple’s official migration portal. This is the designated platform for the token swap. Wallet Requirement: You’ll need a compatible self-custodial wallet. Coinbase Wallet is specifically mentioned as a compatible option, but other wallets that support the relevant blockchain network might also work. Always verify compatibility on the official Maple migration portal. Action Required: This is not an opt-in; it’s a necessary step to retain the value of your assets in the new SYRUP token. Step-by-Step Guide: Migrating Your MPL to SYRUP Don’t panic! The migration process is designed to be straightforward. Here’s a simple guide to help you through the SYRUP token migration : Prepare Your Self-Custodial Wallet: If you don’t already have one, set up a self-custodial wallet like Coinbase Wallet. Ensure it’s compatible with the network Maple is operating on (check Maple’s official announcements for this information). Transfer MPL from Coinbase: Withdraw your MPL tokens from your Coinbase account to your self-custodial wallet. This is a crucial step as Coinbase will no longer support MPL trading after April 30th. Access Maple’s Migration Portal: Go to the official Maple migration portal. The link should be available on Maple’s official website or social media channels. Double-check the URL to avoid phishing scams. Connect Your Wallet: Connect your self-custodial wallet to the migration portal. Follow the instructions on the portal to establish the connection securely. Initiate the Migration: Follow the prompts on the migration portal to convert your MPL to SYRUP. This usually involves confirming the transaction within your wallet. Verify SYRUP Tokens: Once the migration is complete, verify that you have received the equivalent amount of SYRUP tokens in your self-custodial wallet. What Happens if You Miss the Deadline? Missing the April 30th deadline for the MPL to SYRUP migration could lead to undesirable outcomes. While the exact consequences depend on Maple’s migration terms, the announcement explicitly warns of potential asset value loss. In practical terms, after the deadline, your MPL tokens on Coinbase will be delisted, meaning you can no longer trade them there. If you haven’t migrated through the official portal, your MPL tokens might become stranded or require a more complex recovery process, if one is even available. It’s crucial to act promptly and migrate your tokens before the deadline to avoid any complications or potential loss. Key Takeaways and Actionable Insights Let’s summarize the essential points and provide actionable advice: Urgency is Key: The April 30th deadline is fast approaching. Don’t delay the migration process. Official Channels Only: Always use Maple’s official migration portal. Beware of phishing attempts and only trust links from verified sources. Self-Custody is Important: This situation highlights the importance of self-custodial wallets in crypto. They give you direct control over your assets during events like token migrations. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on official announcements from both Coinbase and Maple for any updates or changes to the migration process. Don’t Panic, Just Act: While delistings and migrations can seem daunting, following the outlined steps ensures a smooth transition to SYRUP and safeguards your investment. Embrace the Change: The Future with SYRUP Token migrations, while requiring action, are often a sign of growth and evolution within a crypto project. Maple’s move to SYRUP could bring exciting new features, improved technology, or enhanced tokenomics that benefit the community in the long run. By actively participating in this migration, you’re not just preserving your asset value; you’re also becoming a part of the next chapter for Maple. Embrace this change and look forward to what SYRUP brings to the ecosystem!

Stellar XLM Expands While BlockDAG’s $209.5M Presale & Upcoming 10 CEX Listings Signal Massive Growth,https://thecoinrise.com/can-hedera-hit-1-stellar-xlm-expands-while-blockdags-209-5m-presale-upcoming-10-cex-listings-signal-massive-growth/,"The crypto market is in a state of flux. The Hedera price prediction has analysts debating whether HBAR can realistically hit $1 in 2025, though ongoing market uncertainty continues to cloud forecasts. Meanwhile, Stellar XLM is steadily expanding its role in cross-border payments, yet growing competition from faster, more scalable networks puts its long-term position at risk. Both remain active, but doubts persist about their staying power in a crowded market. BlockDAG (BDAG) , however, promises heavy growth with a $209.5 million presale and 18.9 billion BDAG sold. Its momentum isn’t just holding—it’s accelerating fast. Real adoption, surging mining rig demand, and a rapidly expanding ecosystem are driving its rise. With 10 CEX listings set to happen soon, analysts predict a liquidity spike that could propel BDAG even further. Hedera Price Prediction: Is $1 Jump Possible? The latest Hedera price prediction has sparked debate among analysts, with some forecasting a potential surge toward the $1 mark by 2025. Hedera’s growing enterprise adoption and energy-efficient framework have strengthened its position in the crypto space. However, despite its long-term potential, HBAR’s price action remains highly reactive to broader market trends, making the path to a $1 Hedera price prediction uncertain. Meanwhile, Agent AI, a fast-rising rival priced at $0.00734 is capturing market attention, with some speculating it could hit $1 even sooner. With superior scalability, lower fees, and stronger presale momentum, this competitor is drawing comparisons to early-stage industry disruptors. As Hedera’s trajectory unfolds, analysts are assessing whether its Hedera price prediction remains on track. Stellar XLM Expands its Role in Cross-Border Payments Stellar (XLM) has positioned itself as a key player in cross-border transactions, leveraging its fast and low-cost payments network. Unlike traditional banking systems, Stellar’s blockchain enables seamless asset transfers, making it a preferred choice for remittances and financial institutions. As adoption grows, some analysts believe Stellar (XLM) could see significant price appreciation, especially as regulatory clarity improves and global payment networks seek blockchain-based solutions. However, competition is intensifying. While Stellar XLM continues expanding its partnerships, newer blockchain projects are emerging with even greater scalability and enhanced interoperability. These challenges, armed with advanced smart contract capabilities and increasing developer adoption, are capturing market interest. BlockDAG’s $209.5M+ Presale Shatters Records as Momentum Surges BlockDAG is quickly emerging as one of the strongest growth stories in crypto. With over $209.5 million raised in its presale, 18.9 billion BDAG sold, and an impressive 2,380% ROI since Batch 1, the project is delivering results that few projects can match. Early participants are already seeing substantial returns, and each new batch pushes the price higher, shrinking the entry window with every step. While many tokens rely on hype cycles, BlockDAG’s momentum is rooted in real progress, expanding adoption, and a surge of market attention. Analysts are taking notice, projecting BDAG to reach $1 by 2025, $20 by 2027, and $30 by 2030. These forecasts are not random guesses. They are based on BlockDAG’s consistent performance, the presale’s huge success, and its price increases. But the real game-changer? The 10 upcoming CEX listings in 2025. With fresh liquidity and wider adoption on the horizon, BDAG’s market debut could trigger a breakout unlike anything seen before. Institutional interest is growing, and with BlockDAG already cementing itself as a major player, its market position is only getting stronger. With unstoppable momentum, record-breaking milestones, and a roadmap built for long-term dominance, BlockDAG is shaping up to be the most explosive crypto of the decade. The demand is undeniable, and BDAG is becoming the crypto with the most potential! Crypto Enters a New Era The crypto market is shifting, with Hedera price prediction debates fueling speculation on whether HBAR can reach $1 by 2025. Meanwhile, Stellar XLM continues expanding in cross-border payments but faces mounting pressure from emerging blockchain competitors. Yet, amid all this movement, BlockDAG stands out as the clear front-runner. With over $209.5 million raised, 18.9 billion BDAG sold, and a remarkable 2,380% ROI, its momentum is hard to ignore. The upcoming 10 CEX listings in 2025 further strengthen its position, reinforcing BlockDAG as a top crypto to buy right now. With real traction and unmatched upside, BDAG is shaping up to be the crypto with the most potential.

Whales Accumulate Over 120 Million Dogecoin In Past Week Over the past week, Dogecoin has experienced some whale activity, with large investors accumulating over 120 million DOGE tokens. This accumulation comes amid a period of heightened market volatility, where Dogecoin’s price has seen significant fluctuations. Technical analysis indicates that Dogecoin is currently consolidating within a tight range between $0.16 and $0.18. This consolidation phase suggests a critical battleground for bulls and bears, with investors awaiting a clear breakout. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Price Shows Signs of Recovery — But Can It Last? Shiba Inu (SHIB) has recently demonstrated signs of recovery, with its price increasing by 4.7% over the past month to reach $0.00001551. In the last week alone, SHIB has experienced a notable 23% surge, signaling a growing sense of confidence among investors. Nonetheless, the daily technical rating is neutral, suggesting a state of indecision among traders. Despite this, the technical indicators are generating a ‘buy’ signal, indicating the possibility of bearish pressure in the medium to long term. RCOF Presale Lead This Month’s Cryptos Watchlist For those seeking the cryptos that could yield significant returns before Bitcoin’s bulk run, Dogecoin, SHIB, and RCO Finance have emerged as the altcoins to watch. Among these cryptos, RCOF is generating significant interest, having raised over $14 million in its ongoing token presale. Currently priced at just $0.10 , RCOF has experienced over 800% increase from its starting price, hinting at its growth potential. As the presale nears its end, investors who get in now could benefit when the token price rises to $0.13 in the next stage. Analysts speculate that RCOF may debut at $0.60, with even more promising growth prospects in store for 2025. Rumors in the market suggest that the value of the RCOF token might surpass the remarkable Dogecoin price rally of 2021, potentially yielding gains of up to 10,000x. Now is the perfect time to consider investing in these three cryptos!

Following the largest outflows on record, ETPs have seen 9 consecutive trading days of inflows. Last Friday was the exception, seeing minor outflows totaling US$74m, likely in reaction to core personal consumption expenditure in the US coming in above expectations, implying the US Federal Reserve is likely to remain hawkish despite recent data alluding to weak growth.” Source: CoinShares Bitcoin ( BTC ) products, as usual, led the charge with $195 million in inflows. The king crypto was followed by altcoins, which broke a month-long streak of outflows. Leading inflows were Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), XRP and Sui ( SUI ). “Altcoins in aggregate saw their first week of inflows totaling US$33m, following 4 consecutive weeks of outflows totaling US$1.7bn. The key beneficiaries being Ethereum, Solana, XRP and Sui, with inflows of US$14.5m, US$7.8m, US$4.8m and US$4.0m respectively.” Regionally, the US led the world with $204 million in inflows.

In some cases, the attacks take a year to play out, with North Korean operatives biding their time. The United Nations estimates that between 2017 and 2023, North Korean hackers have netted the country $3 billion. The total haul has skyrocketed in 2024 and this year, with successful attacks against crypto exchanges WazirX and Bybit , which together netted attackers around $1.7 billion. Paradigm writes that the North Korean organizations orchestrating these attacks number at least five: Lazarus Group, Spinout, AppleJeus, Dangerous Password, and TraitorTrader. There is also a coalition of North Korean operatives who pose as IT workers, infiltrating tech companies around the world. Related: Typosquatting in crypto, explained: How hackers exploit small mistakes High-profile attacks and predictable laundering methods Lazarus Group , the most well-known North Korean hacking team, is given credit for some of the most high-profile cyberattacks since 2016. According to Paradigm, the group hacked Sony and the Bank of Bangladesh in 2016 and helped orchestrate the WannaCry 2.0 ransomware attack in 2017. It has also taken aim at the cryptocurrency industry, sometimes to great effect . In 2017, the group hit two crypto exchanges — Youbit and Bithumb. In 2022, Lazarus Group exploited the Ronin Bridge, resulting in hundreds of millions in lost assets. And in 2025, it infamously stole $1.5 billion from Bybit, sending shock throughout the crypto community. The group may be behind some Solana memecoin scams . As Chainalysis and other organizations have explained, Lazarus Group also has predictable money laundering methods after securing a haul. It breaks up the stolen amount into smaller and smaller pieces, sending them to countless other wallets. It then swaps the more illiquid coins for those with higher liquidity and converts much of it to Bitcoin ( BTC ). After that, the group may sit on the stolen money for a long period of time until the attention from law enforcement dies down. The FBI has so far identified three alleged members of the Lazarus Group, accusing them of cybercrimes. In February 2021, the US Justice Department indicted two of those members for involvement in global cybercrimes.

Just days after the awe-inspiring launch of OpenAI’s image generation feature within Sora, a suite of powerful generative AI tools, new users are facing an unexpected roadblock. Citing overwhelming demand and persistent AI capacity challenges, OpenAI has temporarily disabled image generation for newcomers to Sora. For those in the cryptocurrency space who are keenly observing the intersection of AI and digital assets, this development underscores a critical point: even the most advanced technologies face growing pains as adoption surges. Let’s dive into what this means and why it matters. Sudden Halt to Image Generation: What’s Happening with OpenAI Sora? If you were excited to jump into Sora and explore its much-hyped image generation capabilities, especially after witnessing its Studio Ghibli-esque animation style recreations, you might be met with a temporary stop sign. OpenAI, in a recent update on their support pages, announced the suspension of image generation for new Sora users. The message is clear: “We’re currently experiencing heavy traffic and have temporarily disabled Sora video generation for new accounts. If you’ve never logged into Sora before, you can still generate images with Sora.” This might sound a bit confusing, but it essentially means if you’re a brand new user, the image generation feature is currently off-limits. Existing Sora users, however, seem to retain access, at least for now. This sudden pause raises a few crucial questions: Unprecedented Demand: The sheer popularity of Sora’s image generation feature likely exceeded even OpenAI’s optimistic projections. The ability to create stunning visuals with simple text prompts has clearly captured the imagination of users globally. Infrastructure Strain: Running sophisticated generative AI models, especially for resource-intensive tasks like image and video creation, demands significant computational power. The current situation suggests that OpenAI’s infrastructure is struggling to keep pace with the user load. Rapid Growth Challenges: This incident highlights the inherent challenges of scaling AI services rapidly. Balancing innovation with infrastructure readiness is a tightrope walk for even tech giants like OpenAI. CEO Sam Altman’s Take: “Haven’t Been Able to Catch Up” Adding context to the situation, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the AI capacity crunch on social media platform X. He mentioned that the company “hasn’t been able to catch up” since the feature’s launch. Altman also praised the OpenAI staff for their tireless efforts, working late nights and weekends to maintain service availability. This candid admission from the top underscores the severity of the demand and the ongoing efforts to resolve the AI capacity bottleneck. Why This Matters for the Crypto and AI Enthusiast For those invested in the cryptocurrency world, this OpenAI situation is more than just a tech hiccup. It reflects broader trends and challenges within the rapidly evolving AI landscape that have implications for digital assets and decentralized technologies: Aspect Implication for Crypto & AI AI Capacity Limits Demonstrates that even cutting-edge AI is resource-intensive. Decentralized solutions might offer alternative models for distributing computational load in the future. Demand Surges Highlights the immense user appetite for generative AI . This demand will likely drive further innovation and investment in both AI and related infrastructure, potentially including blockchain-based solutions. Centralized Bottlenecks The reliance on centralized platforms like OpenAI can create single points of failure or congestion. Decentralized AI initiatives could offer more resilient and scalable alternatives in the long run.
