Helium operates an IoT network using hotspot technology, while Raydium offers a fast trading system through Solana’s DEX, both aiming to establish strong digital environments. However, both have encountered issues with consistent network functionality and market stability. In this context, BlockDAG (BDAG) distinguishes itself with a stable and resilient framework that incorporates fault tolerance as a fundamental feature. This focus on redundancy and constant operational capability allows developers and users to engage and create on the platform uninterrupted, significantly contributing to its success in presales. Helium: Advancing Decentralized IoT Connectivity Founded by Amir Haleem, Shawn Fanning, and Sean Carey in 2012, Helium launched its mainnet in 2019, aiming to revolutionize IoT connectivity through a decentralized network. The network expanded rapidly by incentivizing hotspot installations. In May 2023, Helium introduced a mobile plan at $20 monthly, greatly increasing user engagement. By December 2023, this service generated about 90% of the network’s revenue. Despite its growth, Helium’s native token, HNT, saw significant price changes. It grew by 124% in market cap to $1.3 billion and by 119% in price to $7.54 in Q3 2024. As of March 28, 2025, the price has fallen to $3.37, a steep drop from its peak of $48.80. Yet, Helium’s network expansion continues, driven by strategic alliances and global expansion efforts. Raydium: Leading the Charge in Solana’s Decentralized Trading Raydium was introduced in early 2021 as a DEX and AMM on the Solana blockchain, leveraging the blockchain’s capacity for high-speed, cost-effective transactions. This capability has drawn users looking for efficient trading options. By early 2024, weekly trade volumes on Raydium were between $1 and $2 billion, peaking at $12 billion later that year, indicating swift growth. As of March 28, 2025, Raydium’s token, RAY, is valued at $2.00, with a trading volume of about $56.99 million over 24 hours and a market cap of approximately $581.66 million. This represents 60.7% of all trading volume on Solana’s DEXes. Raydium’s success can be attributed to its deep liquidity, strategic partnerships, and ongoing development in the decentralized finance sector, establishing it as a prominent DEX within the Solana ecosystem. BlockDAG’s Dependable Framework for Continuous Uptime BlockDAG stands out among blockchain platforms with its dedicated focus on uptime and consistent network reliability. Its infrastructure is specifically designed to be fault-tolerant, equipped to handle both expected and unexpected disruptions effectively. The system’s strength comes from its geographically distributed nodes and built-in redundancy, ensuring the network stays active even if some nodes or regions fail. The network’s design incorporates multiple data centers globally, which facilitates continuous operations by shifting loads and processing to regions unaffected by any issues. This strategic infrastructure management helps avoid performance bottlenecks and reduces potential downtime, offering a reliable and stable environment for both users and developers. The effectiveness of this infrastructure has significantly contributed to the success of BlockDAG’s presale, raising $209.5 million and distributing over 19 billion coins so far. Currently priced at $0.0248 in its 27th batch, the ROI from the first batch has soared to 2,380%. This robust system not only showcases technical prowess but also builds trust in its capability for sustained performance. With a focus on maintaining network stability, BlockDAG remains a trusted platform for uninterrupted development and operation, essential as it scales and continues to attract more engagement. BlockDAG’s Solid Infrastructure: Key to Enduring Trust and Stability While network dependability is crucial for any blockchain initiative, it is particularly vital for those looking to secure long-term trust from users. Both Helium’s IoT network and Raydium’s decentralized trading platform have significantly impacted their respective fields, yet they have faced issues with infrastructure resilience and market stability. BlockDAG differentiates itself by prioritizing fault tolerance and redundancy, crucial features that ensure it remains robust against disruptions. This commitment not only builds user confidence but also drives consistent growth, evident from its strong crypto presale achievements. As blockchain technologies progress, the value of BlockDAG’s relentless focus on continuous uptime becomes increasingly pivotal, underscoring its potential for sustained success.

He sees it as political posturing and a way to woo crypto voters ahead of the 2026 midterms while doing the bare minimum to keep inflation under control. In an exclusive interview with Cryptopolitan, Arthur Hayes—CIO of Maelstrom, co-founder of BitMEX and one of the most outspoken figures in the crypto world—doesn’t mince words when it comes to the future of BTC and all the things that are weighing it down. With US-China tensions rising and tariffs making a comeback , could Bitcoin become a weapon in the new Cold War? Let’s dig in more with Hayes who thinks China might already be ahead in the BTC accumulation race. Bitcoin’s Wall Street takeover? With Bitcoin ETFs, institutional adoption, and political backing, many are celebrating what seems like the asset’s golden era. However, Hayes sees the flip side, warning that this mainstreaming could strip BTC of its rebel DNA and turn it into just another Wall Street asset. He believes that “Bitcoin is a bearer asset with a finite supply that cannot be altered by government or central bank diktat. It is the complete opposite of any TradFi asset which, even if it is in finite supply like equities, relies on the legal fiction woven by governments and enforced by men with guns.” We asked him if big banks would kill off stablecoin issuers like Tether or if regulators could shut down all stablecoins, bank-issued or not. He stood firm on Tether’s survival and highlighted that Tether is too big to kill because a disorderly unwind of their hundreds of billions of dollars worth of US Treasury securities would roil the market. “Tether is mostly used by non-Americans, US bank will issue a stablecoin in its first instance to service US persons. Therefore, Tether’s dominance will not be challenged,” said Hayes. Is Trump’s Bitcoin Reserve a smart move or a gimmick? Bitcoin and other top altcoins got an official call to be included in a government reserve. We asked Arthur whether this is the first step toward a Bitcoin-backed financial system or just political theater. He pointed out that “Trump and the Republican party have a tough mid-term election coming up in 2026. Trump needs to keep crypto investors on side so they show up with campaign donations and at the ballot box.” He added “But on the other hand, Trump can’t have inflation running wild, so wanton money printing, which would send Bitcoin quickly to new all-time highs, cannot be pursued because inflation harms all Americans. Trump will do the minimum necessary to gain the support of crypto investors.” President Trump Travels to Texas. Taken on January 12, 2021. Photo by Trump White House Archived via Flickr. Hayes believes China’s local governments have been mining Bitcoin for years and may already be ahead in accumulating reserves . He said that “the roughly 200,000 Bitcoin the US government seized or stole from individuals is what is going into the reserve. It is very possible that the Chinese government holds more Bitcoin than that.” Bitcoin as a trade war weapon? With rising US-China tensions and the return of aggressive tariffs, Bitcoin could become a strategic tool for countries to bypass financial sanctions and tariffs. We asked Arthur if we could see governments weaponizing BTC in global trade. He thinks Bitcoin is becoming a key tool for economic resistance. “Bitcoin will become the only way that balkanized economic blocs can be financially connected. In the near future, the major economic blocs will begin blocking the ability for capital to flow freely outside of their borders. At that point, Bitcoin, given that anyone with an internet connection can use it, will be the only way that citizens from different blocs can financially interact with each other,” he added. If global supply chains get disrupted again due to tariffs and economic nationalism, could that push businesses and individuals toward Bitcoin as a borderless asset? Maelstrom CIO suggested that “the balkanization of trade and finance is inflationary as every country must replicate production. The increase in productive capacity cannot be funded out of savings alone; therefore, fiat money printing will be used to finance this build out.” “Bitcoin benefits as the amount of global fiat credit expands. That is how Bitcoin benefits in a global trade war,” he further added. We’ve seen El Salvador going big on BTC, but they’re small. Which major nation do you think will be the first to shift a major part of their reserves into Bitcoin? Despite El Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment, Hayes doubts any major economy will make Bitcoin its primary reserve asset. “It doesn’t make any sense for a government to ditch the privilege of issuing its own currency by fiat.” Arthur Hayes and Changpeng Zhao. Photo by Maelstrom via X. Are meme coins the real central bank killers? Forget BTC and ETH, meme coins are moving faster and creating more liquidity than some national currencies. Meanwhile, we have also seen more scams and hacks in the shadow of the meme coins explosion. Would it be possible to see a future where such coins disrupt fiat systems more than BTC? We asked Hayes, who frequently places his bets on social media. He indicated that “Meme coins will redirect investment flows from investments deemed suitable by the elites, to whatever is hot in the metaverse.” However, he thinks that this will frustrate the ability of baby boomers to dump their financial assets on the youth because the youth would rather buy a meme coin than a stock. During the recent election season, the market saw Trump and Biden-themed coins explode overnight. I asked for Arthur Hayes’s take on political parties officially launching their meme cryptos to raise funds and influence voters. He sees the real meme coin wars heating up during the 2026 midterm elections. “They are the perfect campaign financing tool for young aspiring politicians facing off against the gerontocracy,” he stated While meme coins may be more popular, Hayes says governments have one undeniable advantage in pushing CBDCs. “Governments that are serious about CBDCs will mandate that taxes be paid in them. Given that you must pay your taxes or get shot in the head, they will gain adoption alongside or in spite of meme coins,” Hayes added. Crypto’s next Black Swan? Hayes made waves in 2023 when he predicted the banking crisis. We asked him what the next major crypto shock could be, and he pointed towards a world war. “The Europeans are now hell bent on gearing up for war given Trump wants to find a peaceful solution to the Ukraine/Russia war. What if there is a nuclear exchange between Europe (NATO) and Russia?” he stated. Arthur Hayes has said that AI would prefer Bitcoin because of its energy-backed nature. But let’s go deeper, what’s the wildest scenario you see where AI and crypto collide? He envisions a near future where AI agents control financial transactions, on and off-chain. Hayes mentioned that “Humans will rely on AI agents to conduct all of their financial transactions, which will exist all on-chain in the near future.” He added “ I’m talking about both native crypto and TradFi assets.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

XRP has been pivotal in reshaping global payments, while TAO has been revolutionizing the integration of AI with decentralized networks. BlockDAG (BDAG) , however, is setting the stage for a more expansive framework. It’s rolling out a roadmap filled with decentralized identity features, AI capabilities, and enhanced self-governance, all built on its unique DAG architecture. With a massive $209.5 million from its presale and a staggering 2,380% ROI from its first to twenty-seventh batches, BlockDAG is proving to be more than just a tool—it’s becoming a crucial part of the Web3 foundation. XRP: Its Journey and Market Performance Created by Ripple Labs in 2012, XRP was crafted to make cross-border payments faster and cheaper. It began by tackling the inefficiencies in the banking sector with its real-time settlement capabilities. Initially, XRP’s price was minimal, only fractions of a cent. However, it has seen dramatic swings driven by market trends and regulatory actions. As of March 28, 2025, its trading price is around $2.32. XRP has faced significant regulatory scrutiny, especially from a 2020 SEC lawsuit, which has influenced both its price and market standing. Despite these challenges, XRP remains a powerhouse in the crypto world, with its market cap securing it a spot among the top digital currencies. Its continued adoption for financial transactions by major institutions highlights its enduring utility and potential in the finance sector’s future. Bittensor (TAO): Initial Launch, Market Fluctuations, and Performance TAO, Bittensor’s token, debuted on March 6, 2023, at $93.40, focusing on democratizing machine learning through a decentralized network. This model encourages a collective approach to AI, fostering an accessible market for artificial intelligence innovations. Since its introduction, TAO has faced typical market volatility, peaking at $757.60 in December 2023 before settling at around $479.85 by January 29, 2025. This represents a notable increase from its initial price, offering substantial value to early participants despite market ups and downs. Bittensor’s integration of blockchain with machine learning continues to draw interest from both tech enthusiasts and the broader crypto community. This focus on decentralized and collective intelligence makes it a prominent player at the intersection of AI and blockchain technologies. BlockDAG’s Blueprint for Advanced Web3 Capabilities As blockchain technology evolves, the focus is shifting from merely enhancing transaction efficiency to completely transforming the digital backbone of society. BlockDAG is at the forefront of this transformation. With a remarkable $209.5 million gathered through its presale, driven purely by community support, BlockDAG demonstrates the power of collective enthusiasm to transcend mere market excitement. Currently, at Batch 27, the project has sold over 19 billion coins at $0.0248 each, achieving an impressive 2,380% ROI since Batch 1. However, this is just the start for BlockDAG. The future roadmap, stretching beyond 2026, is ambitious: it includes integration with AI systems, development of decentralized identity solutions, and establishment of autonomous digital communities. These aren’t just plans—they are already incorporated into the architecture of BlockDAG. With a focus on user-centric features like account abstraction, zero-knowledge security, and adaptable smart contracts, BlockDAG is setting the stage for applications that extend well beyond traditional financial uses. Envision a world where personal identity is cryptographically yours and directly controlled, where decentralized AI agents use platforms like BlockDAG for transparent operations, and where governance systems are driven by the community according to codified rules. BlockDAG is crafting a vision of Web3 that reflects its potential to be built on principles of speed, durability, and trust. As the Beta Testnet launches and the Mainnet rollout nears, the future is not just on the horizon—it is actively being shaped. Pioneering the Next Generation of Blockchain Foundations The evolution of blockchain is leading to projects that transcend short-term speculation. XRP revolutionized speed within traditional financial systems, and Bittensor pioneered the integration of AI with decentralization. BlockDAG, however, is planning even further ahead, focusing on an AI-driven ecosystem, decentralized personal identities, and governance led by its community. Its architecture is designed to support not just cryptocurrency transactions but also the broader functionalities that the next phase of Web3 demands. The substantial $209.5 million raised in crypto presale globally without the backing of early venture capital reflects a shift in user expectations—they seek not just quicker transactions but also greater autonomy, practicality, and ownership. BlockDAG is laying the groundwork for the Web3 infrastructure necessary for these advanced capabilities.

Yes, Optimism is projected to close up on $10 by 2028. Will OP reach $50? Reaching $50 for Optimism (OP) would be an ambitious target, requiring a significant increase in its price. This level would likely only be achievable in a highly favorable market environment, with substantial advancements in Ethereum adoption, widespread use of Layer 2 solutions, and strong overall market growth. Will OP reach $100? Reaching $100 for Optimism (OP) would be extremely ambitious and require unprecedented growth and adoption. Does Optimism have a good long-term future? Yes, Optimism shows strong potential for growth and sustained interest, indicating a positive long-term outlook.

Expert Analyzes Four Years of SEC Drama,https://timestabloid.com/are-xrp-holders-burnt-out-expert-analyzes-four-years-of-sec-drama/,"All Things XRP (@XRP_investing), a well-known XRP community member on X, recently highlighted a growing sentiment among long-term XRP holders: emotional fatigue. After years of legal battles and expectations of a major price surge, many investors are experiencing exhaustion rather than excitement. The prolonged legal dispute between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been a defining factor in XRP’s trajectory. Since the lawsuit began, the belief that a favorable outcome would lead to a dramatic price increase was widespread. However, the market’s reaction did not align with those expectations. The End of the Lawsuit and Market Disillusionment All Things XRP drew attention to the fact that the conclusion of Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC did not produce the anticipated market surge. While XRP experienced a surge, it only climbed by around 11% and has since retraced those gains. All Things XRP noted that there was a limited impact from U.S. relistings. He added that there is a lack of new capital inflows and a market already priced in the legal outcome. The result was disillusionment among investors. Many long-term XRP holders had been waiting for years under the assumption that regulatory clarity would be the catalyst for significant price appreciation. Instead, the market remained stagnant, and enthusiasm has waned. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Potential vs. Market Sentiment Despite the fatigue among retail investors, XRP’s fundamentals remain strong. All Things XRP pointed out that the asset plays a key role in global finance. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) is used by financial institutions. The company has secured partnerships for CBDC initiatives , and the asset remains one of the most established cryptocurrencies. However, the contradiction persists. XRP has a clear use case and real-world adoption, yet it remains psychologically draining to hold. The Path Forward for XRP Holders All Things XRP noted that investor sentiment follows cycles, with emotional fatigue often signaling market reversals. However, he believes burnout is a signal. Historically, exhaustion and apathy come just before renewed momentum. While no surge is guaranteed, past trends suggest fatigue may lead to renewed interest. Many long-term XRP holders feel indifferent, and some have stepped away, yet institutional accumulation often occurs quietly during such phases. XRP’s speculative hype has faded, but its utility remains. As All Things XRP stated , “XRP’s story isn’t over—just evolving,” and if you’re still holding on, you’re part of a unique community. One expert recently pointed out that the digital asset should already be trading above $100 , and this could soon become a reality as excitement builds in the community again.

Despite broader market optimism, ETH continues to face significant downside pressure due to regulatory uncertainty and weakening demand from institutional investors. Why is Ethereum Price Going Down? Ethereum’s decline is primarily driven by growing skepticism surrounding regulatory developments in the United States. The nomination of Paul Atkins as SEC chair, initially seen as a positive move for crypto, has faced mounting opposition in Congress due to potential conflicts of interest. This uncertainty has raised concerns that pro-crypto policies—including Trump’s proposed inclusion of ETH in the Crypto Strategic Reserve— could face delays or outright rejection. Ethereum Price Analysis | March 30 As a result, traders appear to be offloading ETH in favor of Bitcoin, which is perceived as a safer store of value amid regulatory unpredictability. Additionally, liquidity in Ethereum’s spot market has declined 26% in the last 24 hours, reflecting weak buying support at the current ETH price levels. This combination of regulatory headwinds and shifting market dynamics has kept ETH trapped below $1,800. 12.3 Million Addresses at Risk as ETH Struggles to Attract Buyers Ethereum’s on-chain data trends reveals a looming bearish signal ahead. According to IntoTheBlock , millions ETH addresses would slip into losses if prices fall below $1,600. The latest data suggests that the largest accumulation zone for ETH holders sits between $1,596 and $1,790, with 8.73 million addresses holding a combined 3.61 million ETH in this range. Ethereum In/Out of The Money Data, March 30 | Source: IntoTheBlock If ETH breaks below $1,600, it could trigger a cascade of sell-offs, further deepening the downturn. The lack of significant buying interest at current levels suggests that traders are waiting for either a clear regulatory breakthrough or a deeper price correction before re-entering the market. Ethereum (ETH) is struggling to sustain price levels above $1,780 as investors shift capital to Bitcoin (BTC), which recently reclaimed the $84,000 mark. Investors appear to be positioning themselves in BTC as a hedge against uncertainty. If the sell-0ffs continue on Monday, ETH price could be at risk major downsizing if such a large number of wallets capitulate within a short period. ETH Price Forecast: Ethereum Risks Breakdown Below $1,750 as Momentum Weakens Ethereum price remains on shaky ground, trading at $1,808.82, as technical indicators flash warning signs of further downside risk. The daily chart reveals a sustained bearish trend, with price action struggling below key resistance levels. The ADX breakout at $2,212 suggests significant resistance, and ETH’s failure to reclaim this level signals that bullish momentum is lacking. ETH Price Forecast The MACD indicator paints a concerning picture, with the MACD line at -98.38 firmly below the signal line at -105.99. This suggests that downward momentum is still in control, weakening the case for a reversal. The declining histogram bars reinforce this bearish trend, showing that selling pressure remains dominant. However, a potential recovery scenario exists if ETH can reclaim $1,850 and flip it into support. This would signal a possible retest of $2,212, but bullish conviction is currently lacking. A drop below $1,754—the lower bound of current price action—could trigger liquidation cascades, pushing ETH toward the critical $1,600 support, where 12.3 million addresses risk falling into losses.

Bitcoin is bouncing near $85K, Ethereum’s teasing a breakout, and a new wave of altcoins is waking up fast. One name that recently turned heads? Aptos. The so-called “Solana killer” popped hard, showing off what it can do. Early adopters walked away grinning. But here’s the thing—most backers now are wondering if Aptos already shot its shot. Meanwhile, another project is creeping into the spotlight. Qubetics ($TICS) is stirring serious buzz as one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025, and this one might just change the game. Qubetics isn’t here to play copycat. While projects like Aptos focus on speed and scalability, Qubetics is going straight for the jugular—solving some of the biggest real-life headaches that’ve plagued crypto since day one. Its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet is exactly what the space needs. From freelancers to global brands, folks are finally getting the tools to handle crypto without needing to be some kinda tech wizard. That’s why analysts and community members are tagging Qubetics as one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025. Aptos (APT): The New Kid with Speed, But Is It Enough? Aptos came in hot. Launched by ex-Meta engineers, it promised to fix the mess others left behind. Using its Move programming language and lightning-fast TPS (transactions per second), Aptos aimed to knock Solana off its pedestal. After a strong start, APT soared past $9 and even touched $11. Folks were calling it the next-gen Layer 1 chain. The project locked down some major partnerships, too. From blockchain gaming to DeFi projects, Aptos tried grabbing a slice of every market. Binance and other big names jumped in, adding fuel to the fire. With a market cap north of $3 billion, Aptos ain’t small potatoes anymore. But here’s the kicker—after that huge pump, APT’s been sliding. Right now, it’s hovering around $9, struggling to reclaim those highs. Analysts predict it could revisit $7 if the market softens, or rip back to $12 if momentum returns. Still, the hype’s cooled off, and folks are asking if Aptos is really worth chasing anymore. What’s missing? Real-life application for everyday people. Aptos might be fast, but how many freelancers, small businesses, or average Joes are out here trying to code on Move or build dApps? That’s why the search for top cryptos to buy for 2025 is shifting toward projects like Qubetics that offer actual utility for normal folks. Qubetics ($TICS): The Top Crypto to Buy for 2025 with a Revolutionary Wallet Qubetics isn’t just another shiny token. It’s the project turning heads because it’s fixing what’s broken. The Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet isn’t some gimmick—it’s the real deal. Imagine being able to send, receive, and manage your crypto bag across multiple blockchains without losing sleep over private keys, bridges, or sketchy exchanges. Picture this: a Miami-based real estate agent closes deals with international clients. Payments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or USDT? No problem. Qubetics’ wallet lets him manage it all from one place. No third-party risks, no BS. Or think about a freelance photographer in LA getting gigs from Paris, Dubai, and Tokyo. Every time a client pays in a random token, it’s a nightmare juggling different wallets and exchanges. Qubetics makes that mess disappear. Payments land instantly, assets swap seamlessly, and she can cash out whenever she wants. Even big-time brands are watching. E-commerce platforms, SaaS companies, and global remittance services see Qubetics as a solution to the tangled web of crypto payments. Cross-chain transactions without backend chaos? That’s the dream—and Qubetics is building it. No wonder it’s ranking high on every list of top cryptos to buy for 2025. Now, let’s talk numbers. The crypto presale is already deep into its 27th stage. Over 504 million tokens sold. More than 23,900 holders in the bag. $15.5 million raised—and counting. Right now, $TICS is sitting pretty at $0.1300 per token. Analysts are drooling over the possible returns. If $TICS hits $1 after the presale? That’s a wild 669% ROI. Smash through $5? You’re staring down 3,745%. $6 means a fat 4,514%. But here’s where it gets juicy—projections have $TICS landing between $10 and $15 after the mainnet launch. That’s a potential 7,591% to 11,437% ROI. Life-changing kinda money. With Qubetics solving real-world problems and those insane ROI predictions, it’s easy to see why $TICS is being crowned one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025. The presale is still open, but for how long? That window’s closing fast. Final Thoughts Sure, Aptos had its moment. It showed up, flexed its tech, and made early buyers some solid gains. But that ship might’ve sailed. Aptos is still around, but it’s facing the same challenge as every hyped project—what’s next? Speed’s cool, but utility wins the long game. Qubetics is where the smart money’s heading. It’s the top crypto to buy for 2025 because it’s making crypto usable for everyone. Freelancers, businesses, even regular folks trying to dodge banks and clunky payment apps—Qubetics is their answer. Add those ridiculous ROI projections, and it’s a no-brainer. Don’t sit around watching $TICS hit $10 or $15 while wondering what could’ve been. Grab your stack now at $0.1300 and ride this wave. ‘Cause by the time Qubetics launches its mainnet, folks’ll be wishing they jumped in earlier. Qubetics isn’t just one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025—it might just be the best bet of the year.

While present figures are largely underwhelming for ADA, investors are brimming with confidence for a strong reversal in the near future. Cardano Price Can Reach $2.5 In May According to pseudonymous cryptocurrency analyst Master Kenobi, Cardano price is exhibiting cyclical behavior. In a post on X , Master Kenobi notes that ADA’s consolidation in recent days mirrors its price action from Q3 of 2024. At the time, Cardano’s price suffered a steep correction in early August and endured a lengthy consolidation period before rallying. Presently, Cardano’s price is consolidating after the deep in early February that sent prices to $0.49. “ADA is currently in a consolidation phase that resembles its behavior from August-September 2024,” said Master Kenobi. “Since the dip on August 5, it hasn’t recorded a new low – just as it hasn’t now, following the dip on February 3.” According to Master Kenobi, a lengthy consolidation phase will be the precursor for an impressive rally for Cardano’s price. The analyst theorizes that the incoming rally will send Cardano to impressive levels in May. In the short term, analysts are eyeing ADA to hit $1 , citing rising whale activity and positive fundamentals. “If this pattern holds, May could bring a massive pump, potentially pushing the price toward $2.5,” said Master Kenobi. ADA Ripples With Bullish Activity At the moment, Cardano price is trading at $0.6646, a far cry from its all-time high of $3.10. Despite the lull in price action, the ecosystem is brimming with bullish activity for higher valuation. Investors have their eyes on $10 after ADA outperformed top S&P 500 companies in a strong show of resilience. Futhermore, increased whale activity in the space is signaling an impending rally for ADA as community sentiment reaches an all-time high. Analysts have opined that an ADA rally to $10 is not a crazy prediction, citing a slew of positive fundamentals for the network. However, pundits are urging investors to brace for multiple corrections in the march to reach a valuation of $10.

XTZ could reach a maximum price of $4.66 by the end of 2028. By 2031, XTZ’s price may surge to $14.78. Tezos started out really strong as a platform for smart contracts and decentralized apps. After being released in 2018, its price touched an all-time high of $9.12 in 2021. However, throughout this time, it faced issues like lawsuits and power struggles, causing a loss of investor trust. Eventually, the overall market’s effects plummeted the coin’s price, and it has failed to recover to the same mark since then. However, collaborations and innovations are growing on the Tezos network, bringing it into close competition with other smart contract platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Following the November 5 U.S. elections and the emergence of ex-president Donald Trump, crypto markets have responded positively, with Bitcoin prices moving above the $100k mark. Tezos also responded similarly, hitting a high of $1.85. Many crypto enthusiasts ask questions like, “Can the Tezos coin hit $50 in the long term?” or at least, “Will Tezos survive?” Let’s get into Tezos price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Tezos Ticker XTZ Current price $0.656 Market cap $680,394,046.41 Trading volume $12,427,451.95 Circulating supply 1,037,116,227.14 XTZ All-time high $9.18 on October 04, 2021 All-time low $0.3146 on December 7, 2018 24-hour low $0.6456 24-hour high $0.6631 Tezos price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day Variation) 4.89% 50-day SMA $0.7897 14-Day RSI 40.21 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green days 14/30 (47%) 200-day SMA $0.971 Tezos price analysis: Will XTZ break the $0.674 barrier? TL;DR Breakdown XTZ has gained 1.28% in the last 24 hours. The coin’s immediate support is at $0.64. XTZ’s resistance is around $0.674. Tezos price analysis 1-day chart: XTZ might retest $0.64 support level Tezos (XTZ) shows a mixed outlook on March 30. The price is below the 20-period SMA, suggesting bearish pressure. XTZ might retest $0.64 support level However, the MACD is slightly positive, which may hint at a potential short-term reversal. The RSI at 43.50 is neutral, approaching oversold territory. Support at $0.64 is key—if this holds, a small bounce could occur, but further downside remains possible if the support is broken. Tezos price analysis 4-hour chart: XTZ shows weak bearish momentum in the short-term Tezos (XTZ) on the 4-hour chart shows weak bearish momentum. The price is trading below the middle Bollinger Band, indicating downward pressure. XTZ shows weak bearish momentum in the short-term The CMF is negative at -0.31, confirming continued selling, and the MFI is at 9.81, signaling oversold conditions. If the price holds above the lower Bollinger Band ($0.625), a short-term rebound may occur. However, if the downward trend continues, XTZ could break below the next key support. Tezos technical indicators: Levels and action Daily simple moving average (SMA) Period Value Action SMA 3 $0.9071 SELL SMA 5 $0.8381 SELL SMA 10 $0.8000 SELL SMA 21 $0.7435 SELL SMA 50 $0.7897 SELL SMA 100 $0.9996 SELL SMA 200 $0.9710 SELL Daily exponential moving average (EMA) Period Value Action EMA 3 $0.7431 SELL EMA 5 $0.8019 SELL EMA 10 $0.9355 SELL EMA 21 $1.0969 SELL EMA 50 $1.1930 SELL EMA 100 $1.1234 SELL EMA 200 $1.0187 SELL What to expect from XTZ price analysis next? Tezos (XTZ) remains bearish, with the price below key indicators. The MFI is oversold, suggesting a possible bounce if $0.625 support holds. However, further downside is likely if this level breaks. Is Tezos a long term investment? Tezos could be a good investment as its price movements in the past and recent times reflect opportunities for massive gains. Of course, there have been significant bear markets, but the price recoveries that followed put money in the pockets of traders. Also, the platform is quite developed and supports DeFi solutions, decentralized applications, and NFTs – so there are utilities that can keep the coin’s price afloat and upward. However, as always, you should always do your own research because crypto can be extremely volatile. Why is Tezos up? Tezos (XTZ) is up today after bouncing off support at $0.6455, a move spurred by a slight capital inflow. The coin is now trading at around $0.656. XTZ 7-day price chart Will Tezos recover? Yes, Tezos is likely to recover by the end of this year. Expert forecasts suggest that XTZ will approach $2 by then. Will Tezos reach $10? Yes, Tezos can reach $10. Its all-time high was $9.18; significant bullish momentum will be required to recapture this level. Will Tezos reach $50? Based on expert analysis, Tezos may not reach $50 anytime soon. A huge market cap will be required to reach that point. However, mass adoption and integration with new systems could make this possible. Does Tezos have a good long-term future? Tezos seems to have a good long-term future because the platform regularly brings updates, and development is ongoing. It also fits into the larger narrative of decentralized finance and decentralized applications.

For that to happen, future price movements and an increase in Tezos’ adoption must be bullish. Tezos historic price sentiment Tezos price history ⏐ Source: Coinmarketcap Tezos mainnet went live in September 2018 and immediately gained popularity for dealing with the environmental impact of blockchain technologies at that time with its PoS model. XTZ’s price peaked during the bullish cycle of 2021, reaching above $9.0. After 4 April 2022, XTZ’s price plummeted below $4.0; by 9 May, it had sharply fallen below the $2 mark. XTZ surged to about $1 at the beginning of December 2022, but the bears reclaimed the market by the end of the month, resulting in a drop to $0.73. The coin made some recovery in 2023, averaging a market price of $0.8. Despite the partnership milestones achieved, Tezos (XTZ) had a largely bearish 2024. The coin reached a high of $1.4 in April but lost about 60% by August. The bulls soon entered the market, and XTZ saw renewed buyer interest, which resulted in a peak price of $0.7015 in September and $1.856 in November. The surge extended into December—Tezos XTZ recorded a maximum price of $1.909. Price corrections followed thereafter, and the coin closed the year at $1.286. In January 2025, XTZ reached a maximum price of $1.49, but in February, it lost momentum, averaging $0.72 per unit. After a failed attempt at breaking above $0.8 in early March, XTZ is currently trading around $0.6456 – $0.6631.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,TRADING|XTZ|BUSINESS|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-30 23:25:00

The firm is the latest Russian business heavyweight to foray into the nation’s fast-growing DFAs market. The move appears to indicate that energy industry heavy-hitters are now ready to join commercial banks in the DFAs sector. Gazprom Enters ‘Digital Financial Assets’ Sector The Russian media outlet RBC reported that Gazprombank’s issuance is worth 2 billion rubles (over $23.5 million). The gas giant has explained that its DFAs provide an annual yield of 21%. It will issue the coins on March 31. The company will make the issuance via its banking arm, Gazprombank, using the Moscow Exchange’s DFA platform Gazprombank said its DFAs were essentially “tokenized monetary claims on the issuer.” The firm plans issue a total of 2 million tokens, with each token worth 1,000 rubles (around $11.77). The firm said the coins would mature on May 13, 2025, when each token will burn in exchange for a fiat sum of 1024.74 rubles ($12.06). Interestingly, regulatory documents note that the Gazprom DFA “meets the characteristics of digital financial assets that can be acquired by non-qualified investors.” This means that retail buyers can also trade the coins. This is often not the case with DFAs, many of which are only for the use of corporations and professional investors. Gazprom’s offices in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Boevaya mashina [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Telecoms Behemoth Also DFA-keen Gazprom’s move comes just days after a similar issuance from Rostelecom, another majority state-owned firm. Rostelecom is Russia’s largest provider of telecoms and other digital services. It issued two of its own DFAs on the Moscow Exchange earlier this month. The Central Bank issues DFA “information system operators (ISO)” with operating permits. One of the pioneers of the Russian DFA industry was Atomyze, a Hyperledger Fabric-based distributed ledger technology platform affiliated with the metals producer Norilsk Nickel. Russian police have charged billionaire Vadim Moshkovich, founder of the country's top agriculture company Rusagro, with fraud on Wednesday, Russian news agencies said, in the highest profile case against a major businessman in years. https://t.co/BjwmHsPlIh pic.twitter.com/bVzuH9Q2lv — Reuters (@Reuters) March 27, 2025 DFA Investment Is Rising Fast, Says Bank In February, Sberbank published a report claiming that the cumulative trading volume of Russia’s DFAs market has reached 684 billion rubles (around $8 billion). Earlier this month, the same bank issued an index-type DFA that tracks the price of cocoa on the global market . Last year, Gazprom announced the launch of a crypto mining subsidiary. This subsidiary is reportedly working on a 5,000-rig crypto mining center in the city of Veliky Novgorod, in the Novgorod Oblast . Sources think that the center will reach full capacity by 2028, with Gazprom reportedly ready to spend around a $500 million on its crypto mining interests.

Trump expressed his frustration in a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday, saying he was “very angry” about Putin’s remarks hinting at replacing President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Ukraine. He said that if new leadership emerges in Ukraine, “you’re not going to have a deal for a long time, right.” Trump stated, “I was pissed off about it. But if a deal isn’t made, and if I think it was Russia’s fault, I’m going to put secondary sanctions on Russia.” He clarified he meant sanctions on “all oil coming out of Russia.” He also plans to speak with Putin this week. Russia is among the major oil producers in the world. Any attempt to limit Russian oil sales could affect the entire market and raise global inflation. India and China, which have bought much of Russia’s supply since the full-scale invasion, would be especially pressured. Trump said that if no deal is reached to stop the bloodshed, and if he thinks Russia is to blame, he will levy secondary tariffs on oil. He explained, “There will be a 25% tariff on all – on all oil, a 25 to 50-point tariff on all oil,” and countries purchasing Russian oil could face limits on doing business in the United States. Last week, US officials said Ukraine and Russia had agreed to a Black Sea truce as part of Trump’s efforts to end the war. Both sides accepted a 30-day halt on strikes against energy sites. Ukraine agreed to honor the ceasefire immediately, while the Kremlin demanded sanctions relief on Russian Agricultural Bank and other financial bodies that handle trade in food and fertilizers. March data showed Russian crude exports hitting a five-month high. Meanwhile, American sanctions on Russia’s tanker fleet appear less effective. Some analysts think Trump’s new threats could push oil prices higher, given the volumes at stake. Giovanni Staunovo, a commodity analyst at UBS Group AG, noted that “in the past it has taken real disruptions for prices to move higher on a sustained basis,” so talk alone might not spark a lasting surge. Trump recently adopted new economic tactics Trump introduced a plan to impose secondary tariffs on countries buying oil from Venezuela. This threat, contained in an executive order, warns that anyone importing Venezuelan oil faces a 25% tariff on trade with the US. Venezuela is already under heavy American sanctions, and Trump said he was responding to “tens of thousands of high level, and other, criminals” he accused Venezuela of sending to the United States. Beyond Venezuela, Trump also said he might punish Iran with secondary tariffs and spoke of bombing Iran until it renounces nuclear weapons. “If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing,” he told NBC. This warning was included in a letter to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, giving Iran two months to negotiate a new nuclear accord. Trump has previously mentioned he could “go in militarily” if that is what it takes to keep Iran from getting nuclear arms. Iran responded that it will not hold direct talks with Trump’s administration, though indirect contacts are possible, President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Sunday.

Pi has shed 65% of its value in March, but with 80% of its community pushing for a Binance listing, April could open the door to a price rebound—if it lands an exchange breakthrough. Meanwhile, XLM is clinging to its $0.28 support, with falling volume and waning momentum threatening further downside. However, BlockDAG isn’t reacting to market moves—it’s driving them. Keynote 3 revealed over 800,000 active users mining BDAG through the X1 App, creating one of the most engaged pre-mainnet communities in crypto. This isn’t passive hype—it’s measurable participation. With $209.5M raised and presale price still at $0.0248, BlockDAG isn’t waiting for catalysts. It is the catalyst. Pi Network Price Outlook: Will Binance Be A Game Changer? After a steep 65% decline in March, Pi Network now trades at $0.83. Community energy remains high, with over 80% of users backing a Binance listing. Still, no major exchange has added Pi, leaving momentum stalled and sentiment shaky. Technically, a falling wedge pattern—typically bullish—has formed, and the BBTrend indicator is beginning to diverge upward. If momentum returns and Pi breaks resistance levels, a rally toward $1.50 could be in play—a 65% climb from current prices. But headwinds remain. With 117 million tokens scheduled to unlock this month, supply pressure could easily offset technical strength. Without a confirmed listing, Pi’s potential remains largely theoretical. XLM Struggles to Hold $0.28 as Bears Target $0.236 Stellar (XLM) is testing a key floor. Now near $0.286, the $0.28 level is proving to be a battleground. A break below that could lead to a 15% slide toward $0.236, with bearish signals forming after March’s rising wedge breakdown. Trading volume has dropped by 10% in the last 24 hours, and momentum indicators are softening. Coinglass data reveals $995K in longs at $0.28 and over $2.5 million in shorts stacked just above, highlighting increasing pressure on the bulls. There’s still hope for a reversal. A daily close above $0.31 would signal renewed strength. But for now, price action in the $0.285–$0.28 zone could decide whether XLM’s next move is up—or further down. 800K+ Users Already Mining BlockDAG—Here’s Why $1 Is Within Reach BlockDAG’s recent Keynote 3 made one thing abundantly clear: this isn’t a project waiting to grow—it’s already doing it. The headline? Over 800,000 users are actively mining BDAG through the X1 App, a free-to-use mobile mining platform. This isn’t future potential. It’s current momentum, and it’s happening before BDAG even hits centralized exchanges. The X1 App’s success lies in its frictionless model: zero-cost mining, gamified features, and a smooth, beginner-friendly interface. It’s helping users earn BDAG daily while naturally onboarding new participants through referrals and community engagement. This has created a grassroots engine of adoption—where usage isn’t driven by coin price hype, but by consistent utility and interaction. That kind of early traction is rare. It gives BlockDAG a foundation most Layer 1s struggle to build even after launch. And it’s not just mobile growth—the project has also sold over 19 billion coins, raised $209.5 million, and launched a live Beta Testnet that proves the network’s core architecture is already working. More than just technical progress, BlockDAG is strategically positioning itself for scale. With mainnet, exchange listings, smart contracts, and DeFi tools on the near-term roadmap, the infrastructure is falling into place quickly. Each layer adds to its value proposition: from real-world user participation, to cross-platform access, to utility baked directly into the ecosystem. Currently priced at just $0.0248 in Batch 27, BDAG still sits at a stage where early participation aligns directly with long-term upside. And unlike projects that rely on buzz, BlockDAG’s growth is quantifiable, tangible, and accelerating. This isn’t a slow roll toward relevance. It’s a coordinated rollout—with the users, capital, and infrastructure already in motion. As BlockDAG approaches its public listing phase, it’s not just another altcoin launch. It’s the emergence of a functioning ecosystem that could realistically reach $1, not just in theory—but through the layered momentum it’s already built. Takeaway Pi and XLM are both at crossroads. Pi’s falling wedge and community-driven push for a Binance listing offer hope, but supply pressure and listing delays keep outcomes uncertain. XLM is fighting to hold $0.28, with technical breakdown risks rising if bearish momentum intensifies. Both tokens are waiting for external validation. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is already executing. The X1 App’s 800,000+ users reflect a powerful on-chain community forming before launch. Keynote 3 laid out a clear blueprint: onboard users now, roll out utility next, and unleash listings with network demand already in place. At $0.0248, with $209.5M raised and real traction in motion, BDAG isn’t a concept—it’s a functioning ecosystem. When it hits public markets, it won’t be introducing itself. It’ll be amplifying momentum that’s already been built.

New data from the blockchain tracking firm Bubblemaps is shedding light on on-chain activity of Hayden Davis, who admitted to having a role in both Libra ( LIBRA ), a memecoin originally backed by Argentinian President Javier Milei before he quickly disavowed it, and Melania Meme ( MELANIA ), a coin inspired by Melania Trump. MELANIA began a steep descent the very day it was launched in January and is now down 95.3%. Says Bubblemaps, “Hayden Davis is STILL selling MELANIA He recently sent $1 million to exchanges and extracted over $2 million from the liquidity pools… For weeks, his MELANIA wallets were inactive – until now… In total, Hayden sent $1,065,153 worth of MELANIA to centralized exchanges and extracted $2,050,666 from the liquidity pool over the last 14 days. And many wallets haven’t sold yet. Why act now? Hayden may have seen the recent drop in attention as a window to quietly move funds while fewer people were watching We’ll keep monitoring for further activity.” At time of writing, MELANIA is trading for $0.615. Argentinian authorities are reportedly attempting to have Davis arrested by Interpol for his role in LIBRA. Says prosecutor Gregorio Dalbón, “I’m here to request the immediate detention of Hayden Mark Davis, a citizen of the United States, who is accused of being one of the principal actors behind the launch of the cryptocurrency LIBRA… The possibility that Davis will abandon his country of residence or hide to avoid answering for his alleged acts appears to be aggravated by the economic resources he possesses, which he can use to move or remain in hiding, hindering our investigation.” President Milei quickly disavowed LIBRA, claiming that he was tricked into supporting its launch. Said Milei in Spanish, “I was not aware of the details of the project and after having become aware of it I decided not to continue spreading the word (that is why I deleted the tweet). To the filthy rats of the political caste who want to take advantage of this situation to do harm, I want to say that every day they confirm how vile politicians are, and they increase our conviction to kick them in the a**.” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

While Solana and Cardano are enhancing their platforms with new integrations and focusing on market strategies, BlockDAG (BDAG) offers a unique approach by rewarding direct participation. BlockDAG’s Beta Testnet not only encourages but requires engagement by offering $6,000 in BDAG rewards for developers, miners, and users. This proactive involvement goes beyond mere speculation, with active smart contract implementation and a presale already raising $209.5 million, proving the power of genuine engagement in shaping the ecosystem. Polymarket Integrates Solana, Targets $170 Milestone Polymarket, a top player in crypto predictions, has added Solana (SOL) for deposits, making transactions quicker and cheaper for its users. This key step uses Solana’s fast and low-cost blockchain to provide a strong alternative to Ethereum’s often overloaded network. As a result, Polymarket expects to draw a wider audience, boosting the liquidity of its platform. This move also shows Polymarket’s dedication to supporting multiple blockchains, keeping it competitive in the fast-changing Web3 environment. On another note, Solana’s market strength is apparent. After hitting a resistance at $144, SOL stabilized around $138. Important technical indicators, like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) becoming oversold, indicate reducing sell-off pressures and a possible rebound. If SOL holds above $138, it could test resistance at $141 to $142, potentially pushing towards the $144 to $146 range. Cardano (ADA) Set for Potential Price Surge Cardano’s ADA is currently consolidating, trading between $0.695 and $0.75. A decisive break above $0.756 could lead to a 12% increase towards $0.85. Conversely, a drop below $0.69 might push it towards $0.65. Technical indicators suggest ADA is facing resistance at the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily chart. Market enthusiasm is evident, with a significant amount of long positions and a 40% increase in trading volume, signaling increased participation and potentially forecasting upcoming price movements. Traders should keep an eye on these critical levels and technical indicators to gauge ADA’s future direction. Earn BDAG Before the Launch: BlockDAG Beta Testnet Calls for Active Participation BlockDAG’s Beta “Primordial” Testnet is more than just a sneak peek; it’s a rewarding environment for early users to earn actual BDAG rewards. With a total of $6,000 in rewards, the initiative compensates the top 10 most engaged wallets, the top 10 mining nodes, and the top 10 wallets with the largest balances, granting each group $2,000 in BDAG at a starting price of $0.05 per coin. Notably, these rewards will be in mainnet BDAG, providing real-world value for their efforts. Developers will find this testnet not only a platform to test but a chance to execute smart contracts, enhance scalability, and gain recognition. The testnet is equipped with comprehensive tools like an IDE, block explorer, and EVM compatibility, which streamline and enhance the development process. This rewarding approach is part of an ongoing success, with BlockDAG’s crypto presale accumulating $209.5 million thus far. Currently at batch 27, the coin’s price has risen to $0.0248, marking a 2,380% increase from its initial batch, with over 19 billion coins sold, demonstrating strong initial demand and growing confidence in the project’s future. As the Beta Testnet runs until May 31, it not only assesses performance in real conditions but also engages builders and participants actively, providing a tangible stake in the project’s success. Whether coding or mining, BlockDAG values and rewards early contributions, setting the stage for its full operational launch. Raising the Bar: BlockDAG’s Testnet Focuses on Real Engagement While speculative movements often lead to quick price hikes, lasting value is forged through utility and active participation. As Solana integrates new features and Cardano addresses market hurdles, BlockDAG gains momentum through tangible involvement and definitive results. With direct incentives for testnet activity and over 19 billion coins already in circulation, BlockDAG is not just talking about potential; it’s actively proving it. With the May 31 deadline nearing, developers, miners, and early backers are not merely observers but are actively crafting the future. In a market that values demonstrable results, BlockDAG equips its community with the necessary tools to make a tangible impact.

While BTC holds key support at $82,000, BlackRock investors disposition may signal optimism. Bitcoin ETFs End 10-day Buying Spree, But BlackRock Investors Hold Bitcoin ETFs drew media attention on Friday as net outflows reached $93 million, marking the end of a 10-day buying spree that added over $1.07 billion in BTC. FairSide data reveals that all of the outflows came from Fidelity’s FBTC, while BlackRock ’s IBIT and eight other U.S.-approved spot ETFs recorded neutral flows, signaling diverging institutional investor sentiment. Bitcoin ETF Flows as of March 30 |Source: FairSide Despite the selling pressure, BTC price showed resilience, bouncing from a 10-day low of $82,000 to reclaim the $84,000 level over the weekend. This suggests that while some institutional players have turned cautious, BTC continues to find buyers at the $82,000 mark, likely driven by macroeconomic hedging. Why Are Bitcoin ETFs Taking a Neutral Outlook Despite Bearish Market Sentiment? While Bitcoin’s brief dip below $82,000 coincided with renewed regulatory uncertainty—following U.S. Congress’ scrutiny of Paul Atkins, Trump’s crypto-friendly SEC pick—the decision by major ETFs like BlackRock’s IBIT to hold rather than sell suggests a more calculated approach among institutional investors. Macro Economic Hedging: One possible explanation is that institutional investors are weighing broader macroeconomic risks. With concerns mounting over Trump’s proposed trade policies and their potential impact on traditional stock markets, Bitcoin remains an attractive hedge due to its independence from traditional financial structures. This could explain why ETF outflows have been concentrated in specific funds like FBTC rather than across the board. Large Un-realized Profits Prior to the $93 million sell-off observed on Friday, Bitcoin ETFs had acquired over $1.07 billion in the previous 10-days. This sheer volume of Bitcoin accumulated by ETFs in recent weeks means that short-term supply is limited. It also hints that majority on investors who began buying when BTC prices plunged below $77,000 over the past week are still in profit, hence the reluctance to sell. Bitcoin Price Holds $82,000 Support, March 30, 2025 | Source: CoinMarketCap This key dynamics may have contributed to Bitcoin price holding key support levels above $82,000. Notably, while BTC price rebounded, leading altcoins like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple ( XRP ) have lagged behind, further reinforcing the narrative that institutional capital remains primarily focused on BTC. What’s Next for Bitcoin ETFs and Institutional Demand? The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether Bitcoin ETFs resume their accumulation trend or if further outflows signal a shift in sentiment. Investors will closely watch developments in U.S. regulatory policy and broader market conditions to assess whether Bitcoin’s status as a safe-haven asset remains intact. If the macroeconomic environment continues to favor Bitcoin as a non-correlated asset, ETF inflows could resume, pushing BTC to new highs. However, prolonged uncertainty or negative regulatory developments could trigger deeper corrections. For now, BlackRock and other major institutional players appear to be maintaining their positions, indicating confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Bitcoin Price Forecast: BTC Faces Critical Resistance at $84,400 Amid Bearish Pennant Formation Bitcoin price forecast signals remains uncertain as BTC trades at $82,363, hovering near key support levels. The Bollinger Bands show tightening volatility, with resistance at $84,412 and $88,215. The Parabolic SAR at $80,237 suggests a continuation of the downtrend unless BTC breaks above the mid-range resistance. Bitcoin Price Forecast A bearish pennant formation signals potential downside risk. If BTC fails to reclaim $84,400, selling pressure could drive the price towards $80,600 or even the lower Bollinger Band at $80,237. The volume delta reveals declining buying momentum, supporting the bearish case. However, a bullish scenario emerges if BTC can hold above $82,000 and break past $84,400 with strong volume. This could lead to a rally toward $88,215, negating the bearish pennant. With key resistance intact, Bitcoin’s trajectory depends on its next move at this crucial level.

However, this time around, China’s stock rally has diverged from the emerging markets, with multiple developing-nation equities remaining stagnant. Analysts claim that since most Chinese stock gains stemmed from the ongoing tech frenzy and not exactly from an improving economy, the rally has had little impact on other markets. China’s tech-supported stock rally began in January after Deepseek launched. Manik Narain, head of emerging-market strategy research at UBS Group AG in London, argued that a tech boost primarily drove the Chinese stock rally; hence, it’s very unlikely to have a “large spillover impact” on emerging markets. He added, “This is not the classical Chinese playbook of 2009, 2016, and 2020 that ultimately morphed into deported EM recoveries.” Since August 2024, The MSCI China Index has climbed by over 30% while EM outside China fell by 7%, contrary to other years where both markets saw gains consequently. Between 2009 and 2010, China’s share surged by 63%, while EM shares rose by more than 100%. More recently, in 2016 -2017, China’s stocks grew by 50% while the EM broad gauge increased by 46%. Chinese stocks were first influenced by tech boost in mid-January when the AI model Deepseek launched. Prior to this, specifically in September 2024, the stocks surged slightly over an overall economic stimulus. Meanwhile, the KraneShares CSI China Internet Fund, an ETF tracking China, received over $1.5 billion in 2025. Nonetheless, the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ex-China ETF was set for one of its few monthly outflows since 2022. Vedda says China’s outperformance could last longer Vincenzo Vedda, chief investment officer at DWS International in Frankfurt, believes China’s outperformance of other emerging markets may last longer. Nonetheless, China’s stock market is overly worried about higher US tariffs. President Donald Trump has already imposed 25% levies on auto imports from the country and is considering announcing more “reciprocal tariffs on April 2. Analysts have hinted that any more levies could dull the stock market growth and even result in more losses for EM. Some funds, however, have begun cutting off their Chinese holdings. Rohit Chopra, a portfolio manager at Lazard Asset Management in New York, even said that they slashed some Chinese holdings from most of their funds. He claimed their funds were slightly less exposed to or underweight in China. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Chun said this shift will be driven by treasury managers feeling compelled to at least experiment with Bitcoin ( BTC ). “If you tried it and it worked, you’re a genius. If you tried it and it didn’t work, you at least tried. But if you didn’t try and have no good reason, your job may be at risk.” Strategy (MSTR) is the largest corporate Bitcoin holder of all 89 public-traded firms that currently have Bitcoin on their balance sheets, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET. One more firm could be added to the list after GameStop's $1.3 billion convertible notes offering on March 26, which the firm intends to use to buy its first batch of Bitcoin. Tesla and Block are the only S&P 500-listed firms that hold Bitcoin — meaning at least another 123 S&P 500 firms would need to invest in Bitcoin by 2030 for Chun’s prediction to be correct. The top 10 largest corporate Bitcoin holders. Source: BitcoinTreasuries.NET Tech investors and execs expect Bitcoin to keep rising Bitcoin could soar to the $500,000 to $1,000,000 range or even higher by 2030, according to the likes of ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Block CEO Jack Dorsey. Meanwhile, firms adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies have seen a positive impact on their share prices . Strategy, whose stock has surged over 2,000% since its first Bitcoin investment on Aug. 20, 2020 — massively outperforming Bitcoin (781.1%) and S&P 500 (64.8%) over that stretch. But there’s a big difference between firms that adopt Bitcoin for treasury diversification and risk management and those that restructure their entire business models to become the Bitcoin treasury leader within their industries, Chun said. “Companies who are implementing this strategy in hopes of replicating MSTR’s performance are positioning for disappointment,” said Chun, who referred to Strategy as a “one-of-one.” MSTR initially provided US asset managers exposure to Bitcoin at a time when they couldn’t hold Bitcoin directly. That changed when the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a handful of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund applications on Jan. 10, 2024. Related: Bitcoin-to-gold ratio breaks 12-year support as gold price hits a record $3K Despite the increased adoption, Bitcoin used as a treasury asset remains an “unproven strategy” for firms hoping it will hedge against US dollar and fiat inflation or diversify their treasury for risk management purposes, Chun said. That said, Bitcoin is still a more flexible treasury asset than gold, according to Chun, who pointed out the challenges in storing and moving gold bars. On the other hand, Bitcoin is a digital commodity that is GAAP-recognized as a tangible asset with a fungible and liquid profile, he added. Earlier this month, crypto asset manager Bitwise launched Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF on March 11, which seeks to t rack companies with at least 1,000 Bitcoin in their corporate treasuries.

The company's strategy benefits from rising institutional acceptance of Bitcoin, creating a positive feedback loop that could further drive up Bitcoin's price and validate MicroStrategy's model. Despite its potential for outsized gains, MicroStrategy's heavy reliance on Bitcoin's appreciation and its leveraged position make it an incredibly risky investment. MicroStrategy's unique business model and financial execution make it a compelling play for those who believe in Bitcoin as the ultimate scarce asset. In my previous article , I explored how MicroStrategy (MSTR) transformed from a small enterprise software provider to the world's first and largest Bitcoin Treasury Company . This article builds on that earlier analysis by providing a more in-depth view of its successful capital-raising efforts and the measurable progress of its financial KPIs. MicroStrategy has accumulated a hoard of Bitcoin unrivaled by any other corporation or entity, making it a truly singular bet on Bitcoin. By adopting Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset and acquiring Bitcoin at an unprecedented rate, MicroStrategy offers investors an asymmetric opportunity on Bitcoin's ascent, wrapped in a public company. MicroStrategy has essentially turned itself into a highly leveraged Bitcoin proxy for better or worse, which positions investors for outsized gains should the bullish Bitcoin thesis play out. MicroStrategy has seen its share price skyrocket since adopting its Bitcoin strategy. Data by YCharts A Leveraged Pure-Play on 'Digital gold' MicroStrategy currently holds over half a million bitcoins on its balance sheet, which gives it exposure to 2.4% of Bitcoin's total supply. This massive position worth over $40 billion dollars gives MicroStrategy a unique value proposition as a leveraged Bitcoin pure-play unlike any other equity. In fact, MicroStrategy has historically moved 2-4x in magnitude for every 1x move in Bitcoin. Over the past three years, MicroStrategy shares have historically moved about 2x for every 1x move in Bitcoin, and often exceeded a 2x beta during euphoria phases. Not even a Bitcoin ETF provides this degree of torque. MicroStrategy investors essentially get a Bitcoin ETF on steroids, amplified by corporate holdings and clever uses of debt. Of course, this leverage play cuts both ways. For MicroStrategy to succeed, it requires Bitcoin to keep appreciating at a meaningful pace. While it's hard to predict the future value of any asset as volatile and unpredictable as Bitcoin, there are several compelling reasons to believe that Bitcoin will continue to skyrocket is value in the coming years. If this scenario were to play out, MicroStrategy could legitimately become one of the most valuable companies in the world. Positive Feedback Loop Created by Institutional Tailwinds MicroStrategy's strategy is increasingly buoyed by the rising institutional acceptance of Bitcoin. At the time MicroStrategy adopted its strategy, its future was far from certain. However, Wall Street and corporate America are finally warming up to Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class after years of skepticism. BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund, which manages over $15 billion, had disclosed ~$47.4 million position in Bitcoin as of early 2025. While this amount only represents a small percent of its AUM, it is significant as a real sign of mainstream adoption. Even well-known companies like GameStop ( GME ) are starting to adopt MicroStrategy's Bitcoin business model, which will only further drive up demand for and subsequently the price of Bitcoin. In other words, the success of MicroStrategy creates a positive feedback loop. As MicroStrategy continues to succeed with its strategy, more companies and organizations will be incentivized to follow MicroStrategy's lead, thus further pushing up Bitcoin's cost. This, in turn, will only further validate MicroStrategy's business model of acquiring bitcoin as a legitimate way to increase shareholder value. As more companies and funds hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, the price of Bitcoin will only continue to rise. GameStop recently became one of the highest profile companies to announce plans to accumulate bitcoin as part of its strategy. GameStop's strategy is largely influenced by MicroStrategy's own capital-raising success, which demonstrates the self-reinforcing nature of institutional and corporate adoption. CryptoSlate The Inherent Value of Bitcoin Bitcoin's value proposition primarily rests on its provable scarcity, artificial scarcity, and sound money principles. While many scoff at the notion of Bitcoin being coined 'digital gold', there are good reasons why Bitcoin can be considered as such. In fact, Bitcoin is superior to gold in its hard cap of 21 million bitcoins. While gold is indeed scarce to a certain degree, there is no certainty that gold will retain its scarcity moving forward, be it through discoveries of new gold reserves or even through technological breakthroughs that make gold cheaper to make artificially . Bitcoin removes all doubt in its ability to remain a perfectly scarce asset as a result of its artificial scarcity. Even the rise of AI could indirectly support Bitcoin, as AI's growth may accelerate the digital transformation of finance. It will also likely lead to job automation and economic shifts that lead more people to seek stable, sovereign assets like Bitcoin. MicroStrategy is already keenly aware of the AI trend, as it was part of the reason why it rebranded to ""Strategy."" The company reasoned that ""Strategy"" was a more fitting name that highlights ""the two most transformative technologies of the 21st century: Bitcoin and AI."" Financial Engineering And Execution Excellence One of MicroStrategy's most underappreciated strengths is the financial engineering and execution behind its Bitcoin strategy. The company's management, let by CEO Michael Saylor and CFO Andrew Kang, has skillfully navigated capital markets to continually increase their Bitcoin holdings per share, which is a key metric to the success of MicroStrategy's strategy. After all, if existing shareholders can see their own individual Bitcoin exposure grow despite the company issuing equity to raise funds, MicroStrategy's model clearly works. MicroStrategy has even come up with a novel performance metric for this strategy called ""BTC Yield,"" which basically tracks the percentage growth in its bitcoin holdings relative to its diluted share count. In 2024, the company illustrated how accretive this financing strategy was by achieving a stunning 74.3% BTC Yield . In other words, MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings per share grew by 74.3%. Using such a metric, shareholders have an easy way to measure the success of the company by taking out the noise of dilution. MicroStrategy is able to increase ""BTC Yield"" through some relatively complex financial engineering of ""buying Bitcoin with other people's money."" Essentially, MicroStrategy issues long-dated debt at cheap rates that can convert to equity if the stock skyrockets, thereby leveraging its own stock volatility to acquire more Bitcoin. It's an incredibly high-wire act, but the execution so far has been near flawless. MicroStrategy has since deepened this strategy by issuing billions more in new convertible senior notes, along with introducing a ""Strike"" preferred stock series. This is all aimed at funding additional Bitcoin purchases. The company's ""21/21"" plan calls for raising $42 billion in total, with $21 billion coming from debt and $21 billion coming from equity/preferred by 2027. Notably, MicroStrategy has already secured $20 billion towards this goal, and has refinanced older debt into lower-coupon convertible notes in order to maintain a BTC Yield above 15%. Despite Growing Success, MicroStrategy is Still Incredibly Risky Despite MicroStrategy's enormous upside potential, the company is arguably one of the riskiest plays for a company of its valuation. First and foremost, Bitcoin's notorious volatility can wreak havoc on the company's stock in the short-medium term. We are already witnessing this as MicroStrategy's stock has regularly seen 10% intraday movements. This volatility is especially dangerous during downtrends, where MicroStrategy tends to exaggerate Bitcoin's losses due to its leveraged exposure. For instance, a 50% drop in Bitcoin prices could easily wipe out 80% of MicroStrategy's value. Liquidity and leverage also add another layer of risk. Even if Bitcoin's long-term prospects remained strong, if the asset were to collapse for an extended period of time, MicroStrategy would almost certainly face balance sheet strain given debt repayments down the road. The company's strategy of using equity issuance to pay down debt or buy new Bitcoin also means dilution, as existing shareholders are effectively bankrolling new Bitcoin purchases at the risk of their own ownership percentage. While this dilution has been accretive so far, evident in the company's BTC Yield metric, there is no guarantee that this will always hold true. The same feedback loop that works for MicroStrategy could actually work in reverse in a bear market. Finally, the ultimate risk would be that Bitcoin itself declines over the long term. Such a decline could be from any number of reasons, from growing investor apathy, the growing popularity of alternative cryptocurrencies, Government regulation, the threat posed by quantum computing , etc. At the end of the day, Bitcoin could easily be disrupted by newer technologies that take away investor attention or even make Bitcoin outright obsolete. Valuation Scenarios To illustrate why MicroStrategy is one of the most compelling plays in the market, we can model a few potential outcomes. If Bitcoin were to ~$200k and MicroStrategy executes on the remainder of its 21/21 Plan, the company's total stash of 900k BTC. At $200k per BTC, which is entirely realistic given Bitcoin's price appreciation history, this hoard will be worth $180 billion, implying more than 2x upside from MicroStrategy's current valuation. Of course, a significant drop in Bitcoin's price would also be equally devastating to MicroStrategy given its levered strategy. If Bitcoin were to drop to the $50k range, MicroStrategy's current BTC holdings would only be worth around ~$23.5B. In such a scenario, it would not be surprising to see MicroStrategy even trade at a discount to its BTC holdings, implying a 70-80% drop in the stock. At the end of the day, the driver of MicroStrategy's bull case remains the legitimacy of Bitcoin as an appreciating asset. The largest near-term catalyst for Bitcoin would be the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve . If the Trump administration were to be successful in creating such a reserve, this would legitimize Bitcoin in a way that no other previous event has. What's more, this will also likely lead to a situation in which other nations and organizations race to establish their own Bitcoin reserves in anticipation of Bitcoin price rises or simply in attempts to diversify. Conclusion MicroStrategy offers investors an investment thesis that is as compelling as it is unconventional. Given how unique MicroStrategy's business model is, it is understandable why a large percentage of the investor community is incredibly wary of MicroStrategy. However, for those who believe in Bitcoin as the ultimate scarce asset, MicroStrategy is a proxy for an asset that is poised to reshape the global financial system. While the future is never certain, if Bitcoin is truly the ""'digital gold'"" for the 21st century, MicroStrategy could be one of the most compelling plays on the market right now at its current valuation of $75 billion.",MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-31 00:53:13

Analysts Tout Mutuum Finance (MUTM) To Trump ADA This Year,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/is-2-possible-in-march-analysts-tout-mutuum-finance-mutm-to-trump-ada-this-year/,"Cardano (ADA) rose 8% during the period between March 23 and March 25, attempting to break above the $0.76 resistance level for the third time in two weeks. Optimism from founder Charles Hoskinson’s campaign to promote network scalability and decentralization of governance hasn’t helped the token price remain buoyed, either, with ADA still 35% off its March 3 peak of $1.18. Speculations abound around partnerships with Trump-linked crypto ventures, but analysts wonder if ADA’s DeFi ecosystem can provide enough momentum to recover $1, much less $2. Instead, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly becoming the go-to choice for investors seeking high upside potential for their cryptocurrency, whose presale is now in Phase 4 and a launch price 140% higher than presale. Cardano’s Uphill Battle And Cardano’s more recent price action hangs partly on political events. Donald Trump’s March 3 social media endorsement of ADA caused a rally, but later policy movements excluded altcoins from the U.S. Digital Asset reserves. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming DC Blockchain Summit 2025, at which Trump Jr. and Hoskinson will take the same stage. When looking ahead to what investors can expect in the future, some claim to look forward to partnerships with Trump-backed companies such as World Liberty Financial, whereas other critics describe these ventures as “pay-to-play” and not actually rooted in DeFi. Cardano’s layer-2 solution Hydra has recorded 1 million transactions per second in tests, and its eUTXO model claims base-layer transaction failures of zero—compared to Solana’s 40% failure rate. But DeFi adoption has been slow, leading protocol Indigo offers 28% yields on stablecoins but the returns which are paid in native tokens do not help the appeal. ADA’s ascent to $2, analysts say, hinges on demonstrable bumps in user activity and institutional inflows, neither of which have yet come to fruition. Mutuum Finance Gains Momentum While ADA suffers over the uncertainty of their future projects, it has little else to concern itself with compared to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which has attracted 7,400 investors who have so far contributed $5.7 million to its presale. Phase 4 tokens are priced at $0.025, with a 20% increase to $0.03 coming in Phase 5. With the listing price set at $0.06, that’s already secured 140% profits for pre-release buyers, and with post-launch projections of $3 mean it’ll be a 14,900% jump from this stage. Demand is driven by the project’s lending model. Users lock assets such as ETH or stablecoins into the platform, in exchange for interest-bearing mtTokens, which grow in value over time and can be traded on a range of DeFi platforms. MUTM tokens are continuously in demand from a buy-and-distribute mechanism where platform revenue is redirected to buy back MUTM tokens. In addition, overcollateralized loans and something that resembles peer to peer lending allows a greatly reduced systemic risk, appealing to conservative investors. Security and Incentives Mutuum Finance’s smart contract audit with Certik is almost done, with results to be published soon through official channels. The giveaway of 100,000 dollars to presale players, coupled with all this transparency, further cultivates confidence. Ten investors will take home $10,000 each as Phase 3 winds down fueling the FOMO even more. But as Cardano wrestles with execution of its technical strengths into market prevalence, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) brings together functionality and investor attraction. Its computed tokenomics and low presale entry point are concrete advantages over the speculative political gusts afflicting ADA. With Phase 4 in, gaining tokens for $0.025 becomes a narrow window phase which could be deciding for anyone ready for an exponential growth. Time To Act Cardano’s $2 target depends on the whims of some other forces altogether: regulatory changes, partnership announcements and DeFi adoption. That differs from Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which sets measurable goals, locking in presale profits and reporting a target of $3 post launch that aligns with analyst consensus. It is worth noting that Certik verification is in the final stage of assessment, with Phase 4 live, meaning to delay risk missing out on the lowest price available.

The cryptocurrency market is alive with new opportunities, and investors are flocking to fresh projects that could skyrocket. As the market continues to evolve, several meme coins are catching the eye of investors worldwide. In this article, we will take a deep dive into Arctic Pablo Coin (APC), Floki Inu, and Bone ShibaSwap, highlighting their latest developments and potential for explosive growth. This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Floki Inu, and Bone ShibaSwap. Arctic Pablo Coin: A Glimpse into a Rewarding Investment Opportunity Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is fast becoming one of the most talked-about meme coins of 2025. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a newcomer to the world of cryptocurrencies, Arctic Pablo presents a unique opportunity. The presale of this token is especially enticing, with early investors set to reap potentially massive rewards. The project’s approach, including staking, referral incentives, and community competitions, is setting a high standard for what investors should expect from meme coins. APC offers a 66% APY during the presale, allowing investors to stake tokens and earn substantial rewards. Plus, the referral program allows you to spread the word about this exciting coin and earn even more. The community-centric competitions offer additional ways to earn APC tokens and USD rewards, making Arctic Pablo one of the most attractive opportunities in the meme coin market. One of the most compelling features of Arctic Pablo is its token burn mechanism, designed to enhance scarcity and value. Unsold tokens are burned each week during the presale, ensuring a deflationary environment. When the presale is over, any unsold tokens will also be burned, increasing the long-term sustainability and value of APC tokens. These transactions are recorded on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring transparency and reliability. The current presale price for Arctic Pablo Coin is just $0.000083, with a launch price of $0.008. That means early investors could see an ROI of over 9552.41% as the coin progresses to the listing price. With over $2 million raised so far and the project entering its 16th phase in Crystal Cove, there’s never been a better time to invest in Arctic Pablo Coin. The Presale Opportunity: Arctic Pablo Coin’s Unmatched Potential As Arctic Pablo reaches the Crystal Cove phase, the excitement is palpable. The presale is structured to provide maximum opportunities for early investors to secure their tokens at a low price before it inevitably rises. The project’s presale journey has already passed through 14 locations, and now, Crystal Cove is its current stop. During this presale stage, APC tokens are priced at an incredibly low $0.000083, giving investors the chance to purchase tokens before they increase in value. The Arctic Pablo presale is designed uniquely, without traditional stages. Instead, each “location” in its journey represents a significant phase of growth for the coin, building anticipation as the price continues to rise with every location. The token burn mechanism that’s in place adds another layer of value, ensuring that the total supply will gradually decrease, further enhancing the value of each token. By getting in early, you have the chance to secure an ROI of more than 9552.41%, from $0.000083 to the expected launch price of $0.008. With over $2 million raised so far, the momentum is building rapidly. As the meme coin presale continues, Arctic Pablo Coin is only becoming more valuable with each new phase. Get in now and position yourself to experience significant returns. Floki Inu: Latest Developments and Market Trends Floki Inu continues to make headlines as one of the most popular meme coins in the market. With its strong community-driven initiatives and exciting developments, Floki has cemented its position as a major player in the meme coin space. The recent introduction of the FlokiFi platform, a decentralized finance platform, has provided more utility for Floki Inu, enhancing its value and appeal to both investors and the wider crypto community. As Floki Inu continues to innovate, it remains one of the top new meme coins to buy for 2025. Bone ShibaSwap: New Updates and Market Movement Bone ShibaSwap has seen a significant increase in activity as it continues to gain attention within the Shiba Inu ecosystem. Recent updates include new partnerships and a growing user base for the ShibaSwap platform, which allows users to stake tokens, earn rewards, and participate in governance decisions. Bone ShibaSwap’s utility has expanded, making it an attractive asset for investors looking for more than just speculative gains. The token’s growth and the Shiba Inu ecosystem’s expansion make Bone ShibaSwap one of the standout meme coins of 2025. Final Thoughts: The Excitement Around Arctic Pablo Coin’s Presale The world of meme coins is growing, and Arctic Pablo Coin stands out as a leader in this space. With its unique presale structure, token burn mechanism, staking rewards, and ROI potential, APC is a promising investment for anyone looking to capitalize on the top new meme coins to buy for 2025 . While Floki Inu and Bone ShibaSwap continue to make waves in the market, Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale offers an exceptional opportunity to secure your position at an incredibly low price before it skyrockets.

With meme coin mania heating up again, one thing’s clear—early buyers are already stacking serious gains while others sit back watching. From Solana-based meme surges to Ethereum giants getting fresh utility layers, it’s a feeding frenzy out there. But here’s the kicker: the smartest plays aren’t even on the market yet—they’re in presales. That’s where BTFD Coin (BTFD) is flipping the game. Sitting in Stage 15 of 16, with a full P2E game already live, 2900% potential ROI, and a limited-time LAUNCH100 bonus deal, BTFD is quickly becoming the most talked-about meme coin presale. Combine that with strong movers like Notcoin (NOT) and Neiro (NEIRO), and you’ve got yourself a hitlist of the top new meme coins for exponential returns. Let’s break down why BTFD is at the top of the food chain—plus two other coins worth your radar. 1. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Bull Market’s Secret Weapon Is in Presale Mode What if you could get 2x the tokens today, and a 2900% ROI tomorrow? That’s exactly what’s on the table right now with BTFD Coin , which is nearing the end of its presale run. At $0.0002 in Stage 15, just one final stage remains before launch. And when it lists at $0.0006, those who jumped in early could already 3x their investment. But it gets crazier… If BTFD hits its projected moon price of $0.006, that’s a mind-blowing 2900% ROI—turning small plays into monster gains. And yes, that kind of upside isn’t just hype—it’s fueled by the fundamentals: Live P2E Game : BTFD’s arcade-style game launched on January 1, 2025, and it’s not just fun—it’s paying users in crypto. Connect your wallet, play, earn tokens, and cash out or stake them. Staking Is Live : Since December 2, 2024, holders have been earning up to 90% APY just for locking their coins. Strong Community Backing : Over 11,600 Bulls have joined in, with more than 72 billion BTFD coins sold, pushing the presale tally past $6.43 million. Ethereum Backbone : BTFD runs on the Ethereum network with strong security and fast, cheap Layer 2 compatibility. BONUS ALERT: LAUNCH100 Ends March 30, 2025! Use the code LAUNCH100 and get 100% EXTRA coins—double your bag instantly! Here’s how: Head over to the BTFD Presale Connect your wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) Enter the code LAUNCH100 in the bonus field and apply. Choose your investment amount and confirm your purchase. Watch your tokens double instantly! Investment Scenario: Let’s say you invest $1500 in Stage 15 at $0.0002. That gets you 7.5 million BTFD coins. Use LAUNCH100, and you’re holding 15 million tokens. If BTFD reaches just its listing price of $0.0006, you’re sitting on $9,000. But if it rockets to $0.006? That’s a massive $90,000—from a $1500 play. Why is BTFD the first pick on this list of the top new meme coins for exponential returns? Because it’s one of the few meme coins with real utility, an active ecosystem, and a community that’s bullish before launch. The meme coin presale phase is almost over, and this might be your last golden ticket to get in before listings hit. 2. Notcoin (NOT): The Telegram Titan Turned Powerhouse Built straight out of the Telegram ecosystem, Notcoin (NOT) exploded onto the scene by gamifying user interaction. Unlike traditional meme coins, NOT made it cool to earn coins by just tapping a screen—blending addictive gaming mechanics with viral network effects. It recently gained traction through integrations with The Open Network (TON), making it more than just a tap-to-earn gimmick. With an upcoming mainnet transition and deeper DeFi compatibility in the pipeline, Notcoin’s appeal lies in how it continues to drive mass engagement while staying accessible. Why is Notcoin in this mix? Because it’s already captured millions of users and evolved into a scalable platform. NOT isn’t just a fad—it’s building something that holds up. 3. Neiro (NEIRO): The AI-Powered DeFi Disruptor Neiro proves that meme coins don’t have to be silly to succeed. This project merges artificial intelligence with decentralized finance, giving users smarter ways to manage their portfolios. It’s not all buzzwords either—Neiro’s AI tools are helping investors automate strategies, analyze market data, and enhance returns without lifting a finger. Currently making waves in the community for its ongoing beta testing and upcoming wallet release, NEIRO is appealing to a more strategic kind of meme coin investor—those looking to blend fun and function. Why does NEIRO deserve your attention among the top new meme coins for exponential returns? Because it’s built for the future of crypto—where AI meets DeFi in a way that feels effortless, smart, and profitable. Final Thoughts: The Bulls Are Already Charging—Will You? They say timing is everything in crypto. Right now, meme coins are getting hotter by the minute, and BTFD Coin is leading that charge with its high-utility model, live staking and gaming, and a presale that’s already breaking records. When analysts predict a 2900% ROI with real-world gaming and staking at 90% APY, smart investors listen. With Notcoin tapping into viral growth and Neiro adding AI intelligence to meme coin investing, you’ve got a mix of plays that covers hype, utility, and innovation. But only one of these is still under a penny, and only one is still in presale. Don’t let this one-stage window close on you. Visit the BTFD Presale Platform , claim your LAUNCH100 bonus, and join the Bulls Squad before it’s game over. This is your shot at catching one of the top new meme coins for exponential returns—before the rocket takes off.

42672358,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=702802,1743384708,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/42672358.jpeg,Uniswap’s U.S. App Store ranking plummets amid declining trader activity,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/uniswaps-u-s-app-store-ranking-plummets/,"Uniswap’s ranking in the U.S. App Store’s finance category has dropped drastically, going from position 99 to 364 in the last two months. For most of 2024, Uniswap consistently ranked in the 190’s within the U.S. App Store’s finance category. The steep drop in Uniswap’s App Store ranking ignites discussions in the cryptocurrency world Following the election of pro-crypto President Donald Trump in the United States, Uniswap’s App Store ranking shot up to around 110th and later surged once more, reaching a record-breaking 99 when the president took office in January. However, Uniswap’s App Store ranking has drastically dropped since then, hitting even lower levels than in 2023. Though election hype helped to drive its rise, the platform’s fall has raised questions about more serious underlying issues. Of course, Uniswap wasn’t the only one to experience a post-election surge. A number of cryptocurrency apps also suddenly jumped in the rankings, but unlike Uniswap, most have since returned to their pre-election levels. SEC drops Uniswap probe, but large UNI transfers to Binance spark market concerns The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently dropped its probe into the firm. As per a Feb. 25 X post , the SEC concluded its investigation into Uniswap and has no plans to pursue enforcement action against the firm. The report followed Uniswap’s announcement that it received a Wells notice from the SEC in April 2024 while the commission was under the leadership of then-Chair Gary Gensler. “This is a huge win for DeFi and reaffirms what we’ve always known – that the technology we build is on the right side of the law, and our work is on the right side of history,” said Uniswap. Still, the number of traders using Uniswap on the Ethereum network has dropped by more than 45% since the start of 2025, falling from 69,680 to 37,000—the lowest since July 2023. Uniswap’s monthly trading volume also fell by 10% from December 2024 to January 2025, followed by another 22% drop the next month. Recent large transfers of UNI tokens to Binance have raised concerns about potential price pressure. On March 21, 2025, approximately 27.9 million UNI tokens were unlocked from Uniswap’s timelock contract, with significant portions subsequently moved to Binance. These transfers coincided with a 10% decline in UNI’s price, from $6.80 to $6.10. At the time of publication, Uniswap is trading at $5.79, a 2.5% decline in the last 24 hours. The bearish sentiment in the cryptocurrency market, with Ethereum hitting a 4-year low against BTC, likely contributed to UNI’s decline. Cryptocurrency apps secure top spots in the U.S. App Store finance rankings amid Trump’s memecoin trend The top three apps in the finance category of the U.S. App Store as of January 22 were all about cryptocurrencies. Among them were the online asset trading platforms Coinbase, Moonshot, and Crypto.com. Hence, cryptocurrency-related apps have taken over the top positions in the finance category of Apple’s App Store in the United States, defeating other apps. President Donald Trump’s meme coin trend quickly increased interest in crypto trading platforms, influencing cryptocurrency apps like Moonshot and Coinbase to secure top positions in the United States App Store finance rankings. In addition, the top 30 free apps in the finance category included other cryptocurrency apps, such as Coinbase Wallet, Robinhood, Binance.US, DEX Screener, and Kraken.

42672956,https://coingape.com/?post_type=markets&p=246707,1743386055,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coingape.png,Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis: 125% Surge in Options Trading Hints $2.50 Rebound This Week,https://coingape.com/markets/ripple-xrp-price-analysis-125-surge-in-options-trading-hints-2-50-rebound-this-week/,"XRP price is holding firm above $2 as traders position for a potential rebound, with derivatives data hinting at bullish momentum for the week ahead. Ripple (XRP) Holds Firm Above $2 as Markets Await Clarity Ripple (XRP) has endured volatile price action over the past week. XRP price closed the last three days of the week with 17% losses, plunging as low as $2.06 on Saturday, before bulls battled back to retake $2.10 at press time on March 31. Looking into the week ahead, market momentum hangs in the balance. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Crypto traders are awaiting clarity on the U.S. Congress confirmation process of Trump’s SEC chair nominee, Paul Atkins , a more crypto-friendly option to replace Gary Gensler. Amid concerns of conflicts of interest, investors will be closely watching. If Atkins’ confirmation faces rejection, many traders could begin selling, potentially driving Ripple price below $2 in the week ahead. 125% Surge in Options Trading Hints Positive Start to the Week While XRP held firm at the $2 support in the spot markets, traders appear to be placing optimistic bets in the derivatives markets. Coinglass ‘ latest data shows XRP options volume has surged by 125.93% to $7,540, while open interest grew 149.56% to $978,100. This significant increase suggests that investors are actively positioning for a strong move. Additionally, XRP’s long/short ratio of 0.9708 in the past 24 hours indicates a nearly balanced sentiment, slightly favouring long positions. Binance’s XRP/USDT long/short ratio for accounts stands at 3.1, signalling that traders on major exchanges expect a rebound. The top trader long/short ratio (accounts) on Binance is also at 2.8, further reinforcing this optimism. XRP Derivatives Markets Analysis, March 30 | Coinglass Another bullish signal is the 12-hour liquidation data, showing that $3.86M worth of long positions remained resilient compared to $1.78M short liquidations. This suggests that long traders are more confident in their positions, reducing the likelihood of a major sell-off. However, traders should remain cautious of the overall decline in trading volume, down 15.03% to $7.27B. This slowdown in market activity could limit XRP’s upside potential unless fresh catalysts emerge. At press time on Sunday, XRP price is showing resilience at $2, with derivatives traders placing bullish bets on a rebound. If positive momentum persists, XRP could target the $2.50 level in the coming week. However, regulatory uncertainty surrounding the SEC chair confirmation remains a key risk factor to watch. XRP Price Forecast: Bullish Breakout Could Send XRP to $2.50 Next Week XRP price forecast remains optimistic as the token holds steady above $2 despite the formation of a bearish pennant on the daily chart. The Parabolic SAR dots above the candles signal persistent bearish pressure, but the narrowing Keltner Channel (KC) suggests volatility is contracting, potentially setting up a sharp breakout. XRP price recently tested the lower KC boundary at $2.0273, reinforcing it as a key support level. XRP Price Forecast A bullish scenario emerges if XRP reclaims the middle KC line at $2.3043. A decisive close above this level could drive momentum toward the upper boundary at $2.58, paving the way for a $2.50 retest next week. Increasing options open interest from derivatives traders further strengthens the case for an upside move. However, a breakdown below $2.02 could invalidate this outlook. A daily close below this level may trigger further liquidations, exposing XRP price to the $1.90 zone. With volume declining and bearish formations still dominant, bulls must reclaim $2.30 quickly to confirm the reversal. Until then, XRP traders should watch for sustained momentum shifts before committing to a firm directional bias.

This trend isn’t isolated—the recent PI coin price drop reflects similar setbacks, linked to delays by major exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase. Amid these challenges, BlockDAG (BDAG) is capturing attention with its dynamic approach. Its latest AMA introduced a $60K Testnet Incentive Campaign aimed at boosting engagement and testing the network’s capabilities prior to its Token Generation Event. This move has energized both new and existing holders, sparking significant demand for BDAG. TRON (TRX) Price Analysis: From Profit Peak to Steady Decline Recent TRON (TRX) price analysis reveals a substantial decrease—nearly 50% from its 2024 peak—yet it remains a top performer among layer-1 networks. Despite the downturn, TRON amassed over $700 million in 2025, surpassing competitors like Ethereum and Solana. Furthermore, TRON’s deflationary approach continues to burn more tokens than are created, effectively reducing its overall supply and potentially underpinning its value over time. The TRON price analysis also identifies a falling wedge pattern, which traditionally suggests potential for future gains. However, the real test for TRON will be demonstrating enduring value beyond transient trading patterns. PI Coin Price Drop Signals Market Skepticism & Reduced Activity The recent PI coin price drop has become a focal point after sinking below the $1 mark, recording an 18% decrease within a single day. Central to this downturn are the protracted delays in gaining listings on prominent exchanges like Binance and Coinbase, which have dampened the initial enthusiasm. Additionally, the deflationary forces are at play with over 528,000 tokens eliminated through transaction fees, and further supply contractions caused by unverified accounts. Although a diminishing supply can often bolster prices, it has yet to offset the prevailing negative outlook. The PI coin price drop is also paralleled by a 37% reduction in trade volume. BlockDAG’s Pre-TGE Momentum Grows with $60K Testnet Campaign BlockDAG recently unveiled a significant initiative as part of its preparation for the upcoming Token Generation Event (TGE)—a Testnet Incentive Campaign. This campaign is crafted to assess network performance under realistic conditions by inviting user participation in a controlled environment. The campaign simulates operational conditions expected after the TGE, providing both developers and users the opportunity to engage with decentralized applications (dApps) and monitor network response under actual usage scenarios. The aim is to ensure a smooth and functional operation once the TGE is implemented. Featuring a targeted approach to engagement and rewards, the campaign will distribute $60,000 in total, with $2,000 going to each of 30 winners. These participants will be selected based on their activity levels, mining contributions, and wallet balances, aligning with the objective to stimulate robust network activity akin to a live environment. The announcement of this campaign has notably increased presale activities, with both new and existing participants eager to stake their claims. This enthusiasm has propelled BlockDAG’s metrics significantly, with over $208.5 million raised, 18.9 billion BDAG sold, and a 2,380% price increase noted since the initial offer. Presently priced at $0.0248 in the 27th batch, BlockDAG is rapidly gaining recognition as the best crypto to buy now due to its strategic execution and increasing demand as the TGE approaches. Market Trends and Strategic Moves While TRON continues to lead in profit generation, recent TRON price analysis highlights a struggle to regain its previous high following a substantial dip. Similarly, the PI coin price drop mirrors this downturn, exacerbated by missed listings on prominent exchanges, which have negatively impacted market sentiment. Amid these market fluctuations, BlockDAG’s community is seeing consistent growth. The recent AMA about the $60K Testnet Incentive Campaign has not only attracted a flood of new participants, pushing the presale past $208.5 million, but has also demonstrated the campaign’s effectiveness in fostering long-term engagement. With BDAG priced at just $0.0248 in the current batch and a TGE on the horizon, the potential for growth is substantial. The combination of strategic timing, transparent operations, and a well-mapped development plan positions BlockDAG as a compelling candidate for the best crypto to buy now .

With ETH hovering near $1,870, the liquidation trigger points—$1,805 and $1,787—are alarmingly close. These vaults have a health ratio barely above 1.00, meaning a sharp dip could flood the market with auto-sold ETH, intensifying downside pressure. While Maker grapples with risk management, Ethena Labs is making a different move. Its new sUSDe pool on Pendle adds real-world yield utility to ENA’s token, potentially offsetting the negative sentiment from its recent token unlock. The pool’s success could indicate stronger mid-term fundamentals. Yet, BlockDAG is already where others want to be. Keynote 3 confirmed its entire DeFi suite—staking, swaps, lending, and more—will go live at mainnet, not sometime post-launch. That’s rare. Backed by a $208M presale and $5M raised in just 48 hours, BlockDAG is showing it’s not just promising utility—it’s building it right now. $238M at Risk: Maker Vaults Face Liquidation as ETH Nears Danger Zone Two Ethereum whales are on the edge of losing $238 million worth of collateralized ETH as prices slump. According to Lookonchain, the whales have locked over 125,000 ETH in Maker vaults while borrowing $143.68 million in DAI. If ETH drops below $1,805 and $1,787, both vaults will be liquidated. With health ratios at 1.05 and 1.06—just above the critical 1.00 mark—the threat of forced liquidation is real. If triggered, the ETH will be auto-sold to cover debt, putting downward pressure on price. ETH is currently trading at $1,870, down 2.2% in 24 hours. Unless these whales inject more collateral, their positions could unravel fast. Ethena Launches New sUSDe Pool with Pendle—Will ENA Demand Rise? Ethena Labs has rolled out a new sUSDe yield pool in partnership with Pendle, running from March 25 to July 31, 2025. This move could draw in yield-hungry investors and deepen liquidity on Ethereum. The extended window gives market participants time to engage, and if the pool gains traction, it could signal stronger user confidence in Ethena’s ecosystem—potentially driving more demand for ENA tokens. With ENA already under the spotlight due to its massive token unlock, this added utility through yield farming may play a key role in shaping its mid-term price direction. Watch how much capital flows into the pool and the returns offered—those metrics could hint at where ENA is heading next. BlockDAG to Launch Full DeFi Suite—$5M Raised in 48 Hours Says It All BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 didn’t just showcase a testnet—it laid out a clear blueprint for becoming a DeFi powerhouse. One of the standout moments was the confirmation that full DeFi functionality will be available at mainnet launch. That includes staking, swaps, lending, bridges, and governance tools—built directly into the ecosystem from day one. Unlike most Layer 1s that roll these out slowly post-launch, BlockDAG is aiming to hit the ground running, giving users immediate financial utility. This aggressive rollout is backed by serious momentum. In just 48 hours, BlockDAG raised $5 million, bringing its total presale to over $208 million. With BDAG priced at $0.0248 in Batch 27, investors are clearly seeing the upside—especially with over 19 billion tokens sold and DeFi tools coming online soon. These fundamentals position BlockDAG to compete directly with Ethereum, Solana, and Avalanche—not just on speed, but on real usability. The market is responding in kind, and if this pace continues, BDAG could emerge as one of the top DeFi-ready Layer 1s of the year. For those looking to enter early, the signals couldn’t be louder. This is the breakout moment. Takeaway The Ethereum liquidation alert reveals just how fragile large leveraged positions can become in uncertain markets. MakerDAO may weather the storm, but if ETH breaks key levels, it could trigger a cascade with broad implications. Ethena’s Pendle integration adds needed use-case depth, but whether that offsets the risk from its $3.29B unlock remains to be seen. Both ETH and ENA are playing defense—for now. BlockDAG, on the other hand, is executing like it’s already live. Its full DeFi suite isn’t a roadmap ambition—it’s a confirmed launch feature. While competitors gradually release functionality, BlockDAG is packaging it all into its mainnet debut. That alone gives BDAG a unique edge in both time-to-market and user readiness.

However, its sluggish growth, high transaction fees, and scalability challenges have left investors searching for more efficient alternatives. Despite ongoing upgrades like the Ethereum (ETH) 2.0, the network still faces congestion and fierce competition from newer blockchain projects that offer faster speeds and lower costs. As a result, savvy investors, often called “smart money,” are exploring undervalued crypto assets with stronger growth potential. One such emerging crypto, RCO Finance (RCOF), is gaining significant attention due to its solid fundamentals, unique value proposition, and growing investor interest. As Ethereum (ETH) growth slows in the market, the migration of capital into this undervalued asset signals a significant shift in the crypto landscape. The Current Market Performance Of Ethereum Despite its foundational role in decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contracts, Ethereum has faced challenges impacting its market performance in the crypto space. As of late, Ethereum’s price has declined, with significant selling pressure pushing it below key support levels. According to available data on CoinGecko , ETH has lost over 23% in the past 30 days. This downturn has been attributed to various factors, including network congestion, high transaction fees, and competition from emerging blockchain platforms. RCO Finance: The Emerging Undervalued Crypto Asset In light of Ethereum’s stagnation, investors are turning their attention to RCO Finance, an innovative DeFi platform that uses new-generation technologies to revolutionize the decentralized finance market. The platform’s solid fundamentals and real-world utility set its token, RCOF, up for a potentially massive rally in the coming months. More investors and analysts are shifting their focus toward RCO Finance (RCOF), recognizing it as a promising asset capable of outperforming Ethereum (ETH) in terms of market growth. At the core of RCO Finance’s groundbreaking approach lies its AI-enhanced trading ecosystem, designed to help traders efficiently navigate the complexities of decentralized finance (DeFi). A standout feature of this system is the AI-driven Robo Advisor, a sophisticated tool that continuously processes real-time market data to develop strategic investment insights for optimal returns. Employing advanced algorithms, this AI-powered assistant detects lucrative trading opportunities before they gain mainstream attention, giving investors a vital advantage. For example, the $Jelly token recently experienced an 181% surge within a single day, an opportunity many traders failed to ride on. The Robo Advisor provides early alerts for such high-value movements, allowing investors to act before the broader market reacts. Additionally, RCO Finance’s AI technology is a key player in risk mitigation. Its real-time monitoring system issues alerts to help traders safeguard their assets from sudden market fluctuations. A recent example is the $SATS token , which saw a sharp 24% drop in just 24 hours. RCOF’s proactive risk management tools could have anticipated this event. RCO Finance integrates real-time financial data from trusted sources like Bloomberg and Reuters to further enhance its reliability. This direct access to verified market intelligence enables traders to make well-informed, data-driven decisions ahead of market shifts. Beyond trading, RCO Finance is a pioneer in asset tokenization, allowing fractional ownership of high-value assets, including real estate, commodities, and other premium investments. The platform boasts an extensive portfolio of over 120,000 assets spanning 12,500 categories, such as tokenized stocks, digital assets, commodities, etc. Another defining feature of RCO Finance is its dedication to privacy. RCOF prioritizes user privacy, allowing transactions to occur without invasive identity checks. This ensures a secure and unrestricted trading experience while maintaining financial privacy. With its state-of-the-art AI-powered trading tools, cutting-edge risk management system, and innovative asset tokenization framework, RCO Finance is revolutionizing the DeFi landscape. As momentum builds, industry professionals increasingly view the crypto token as a standout investment opportunity set to outperform Ethereum (ETH). RCOF Beta: A Sneak Peek Into the Future of DeFi RCO Finance (RCOF) has introduced its beta platform , offering early users an exclusive first look at its cutting-edge features before the official launch. With a growing community of over 10,000 active participants, this beta phase is crucial in optimizing the platform’s functionality and overall user experience. By actively engaging with feedback from early adopters, RCOF is fine-tuning its ecosystem to enhance efficiency, streamline operations, and deliver maximum value. The enthusiastic response from beta testers underscores the platform’s growing influence in the DeFi space. As RCO Finance gains momentum and continues to attract a rapidly expanding user base, its growing potential becomes even more evident. With a strong focus on innovation, user-driven development, and a commitment to advancing DeFi, RCOF is emerging as one of the most compelling investment opportunities in the crypto market. RCOF Presale: An Opportunity You Shouldn’t Miss As the Ethereum (ETH) price continues to struggle, crypto assets like RCOF present a good investment opportunity for smart money to capitalize. The RCOF presale is already in its fifth stage and has crossed the $12 million mark in total funds raised. As this phase nears its final stretch, the token price is set to increase from $0.10 to $0.13, presenting a prime opportunity for investors to join the presale and secure a lower entry point before the price increases in the next stage. Financial analysts anticipate significant growth potential, estimating that an early investment of just $1,000 could skyrocket to over $395,650 by Q2 2025. The RCO Finance team is gearing up for a $100,000 giveaway once they cross the $250,000 mark to celebrate the presale’s success and reward its early supporters. This initiative further demonstrates the project’s commitment to fostering a loyal and engaged investor community. In its ongoing efforts to prioritize security and transparency, RCOF has undergone a comprehensive smart contract audit conducted by SolidProof, a highly respected and renowned blockchain security company. This rigorous security check reinforces the platform’s reliability, ensuring that investors can confidently participate, knowing top-tier security protocols safeguard their assets.

Amid the buzz are innovative projects like Bitcoin Pepe that are gaining traction as early bidders make savvy moves. As top money flows into the crypto market again, the meme layer-2 solution for Bitcoin is galloping in presale with over $5.7 million raised so far. Confidence in the market has also seen a whale, undeterred by a more than $15 million loss on a previous trade, double down on Official Trump (TRUMP). However, could Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP) be a better bullish bet? BPEP presale so far – $5.7 million and rising Bitcoin Pepe’s presale has gained significant momentum in the past week. Now in stage 8 of a 30-stage sale, the project’s token presale has so far hit $5.7 million. Interest in the innovative meme coin project has the native BPEP token trending, with its presale price at $0.0281. Ease of presale participation – one can buy BPEP using any of ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, or SOL – is making it easy for more enthusiasts to take part. Andrea Burel @MAYCOL79 · Follow $bpep Watch on Twitter View replies 7:40 pm · 29 Mar 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter New momentum amid this rapid fundraising reflects a strong interest in Bitcoin Pepe’s vision to integrate meme coins with Bitcoin’s security. This underscores growing confidence in meme coins, particularly as Bitcoin Pepe positions itself as a project building Solana on Bitcoin. Whales making bold moves across the market only reinforces the bullish outlook. TRUMP – whale makes another bet The Official Trump (TRUMP) token entered the crypto space with a bang earlier this year, riding on US President Donald Trump’s inauguration. While the token plummeted afterward amid the scandalous launches of MELANIA and LIBRA tokens, a whale is making a fresh bet on TRUMP. According to details Onchain Lens shared on X, a crypto whale, previously hit with a $15.72 million loss on TRUMP, is doubling down on the trade. The investor recently spent $3.41 million to buy 333,664 TRUMP tokens, with the average purchase price of $10.22 per token. Is this a strategic bet on TRUMP that could pay off significantly? Or are projects like Bitcoin Pepe a better move? Why is Bitcoin Pepe potentially a great opportunity? Bitcoin Pepe stands out with its meme layer-2 for Bitcoin, mimicking Solana’s speed and low costs while leveraging Bitcoin’s security. Per the project’s whitepaper , the opportunity that BPEP offers “isn’t subtle.” The team points to meme coins hitting $100 billion in market cap without BTC. On the other hand, Bitcoin at its peak was a $2 trillion ecosystem without memes. Notably, Bitcoin Pepe wants to set the pace as the first project to merge these two market segments. The project introduces the PEP-20 token standard, enabling anyone to create meme coins natively on Bitcoin. Currently, BPEP is available for scooping at $0.0295 in stage 8.

Community members across Latin America and beyond are pouring into digital assets not just for diversification—but for the kind of upside legacy systems simply can’t offer. With blockchain innovations heating up, many are hunting for the best cryptos for exponential returns, and 2025 might just deliver on that wild potential. While some projects have already carved their place in the crypto hall of fame, others are on the verge of breakout status. Qubetics (TICS), Quant (QNT), and Astra are three names bouncing around serious circles lately. Each brings something unique to the table—but Qubetics is the one lighting up the charts with massive presale traction and analyst chatter about a possible 100x surge. Let’s unpack how these three digital assets stack up for those eyeing the best cryptos for exponential returns this year. Qubetics (TICS): Building a Marketplace for Tokenized Real-World Assets Qubetics isn’t here to play small. This next-gen blockchain project is aiming to crack a multitrillion-dollar nut: real-world asset tokenization. From real estate to invoices, art, equity, and even intellectual property—Qubetics is building a sleek, secure, and borderless marketplace where anything of value can be tokenized, traded, and fractionalized in real time. Here’s where it hits different: imagine a boutique hotel owner in Cartagena tokenizing room bookings for high season and offering them as tradable digital assets. Or a coffee farmer in Colombia minting tokens backed by future harvests and selling them directly to international buyers. A lawyer in Santiago could even tokenize their firm’s receivables, unlocking instant liquidity without groveling at the feet of a slow-moving bank. For professionals, businesses, and everyday backers, this unlocks access to previously illiquid markets, turbocharging access to capital and opportunity. And because it’s all baked into the Qubetics protocol, users can mint, validate, and transfer real-world assets using just a smartphone and some basic onboarding. In a space obsessed with hype, Qubetics is building hard-hitting utility—exactly why many crypto heads are calling it one of the best cryptos for exponential returns in 2025. This isn’t about buzzwords; it’s about problem-solving at scale. And the excitement? Justified. Qubetics Presale & Analyst ROI Forecasts The presale metrics are jaw-dropping. The crypto presale is in its 28th presale stage , with 504 million+ tokens sold to a thriving base of over 23,900 holders . The campaign has already raised more than $15.5 million , and each $TICS token is currently going for just $0.1430 . Analysts are all over this one. Their projections? $TICS at $1 means a 599% ROI . At $5, that shoots to 3396% ROI . $6 delivers 4095% ROI , while $10 smashes in 6892% ROI . And if Qubetics hits $15 after mainnet launch, that’s a staggering 10,388% ROI —turning early backers into serious players. For anyone scanning the horizon for the best cryptos for exponential returns , Qubetics is arguably the most hyped yet fundamentally sound shot at triple-digit gains. With token utility, real-world use cases, and red-hot presale numbers, it’s no surprise it’s being compared to the early days of Ethereum and Solana. Quant (QNT): Enterprise Blockchain Without the Buzzwords Quant is one of those projects that doesn’t need to scream to be taken seriously. Known across institutional and technical circles as the bridge between blockchains and legacy financial systems, Quant has built its reputation by quietly solving one of crypto’s biggest headaches: interoperability. Quant’s Overledger Network allows businesses, governments, and fintech platforms to seamlessly interact across multiple blockchains. So instead of choosing between Ethereum, Bitcoin, or Hyperledger, Quant lets systems work across them all—securely and simultaneously. That’s a big deal. For Latin American central banks flirting with CBDCs, or fintech startups in São Paulo looking to roll out multi-chain applications, Quant offers enterprise-grade reliability with the agility of modern Web3 infrastructure. It’s why Quant keeps finding itself in conversations with top-tier institutions around the world. No wonder community participants consider it a staple in any diversified blockchain strategy. Among mature crypto circles, Quant has earned the respect of backers who don’t fall for gimmicks. It’s known for compliance, reliability, and its focus on real-world enterprise use cases—everything from digital identity to cross-border settlement. It might not make daily headlines like meme coins do, but it doesn’t have to. Its position is solid, and its growth is steady. For those looking at the best cryptos for exponential returns , Quant may not promise 100x in a month, but it offers a unique angle: sustainable, infrastructure-first growth that large-scale partners are already using. And that kind of consistency is golden, especially in volatile markets. Astra: The Web3 Gateway for Data-Driven Applications Astra plays in a different league. It’s not trying to be a “do-it-all” chain—it’s positioning itself as the bedrock for data-driven decentralized applications (dApps), particularly in emerging markets. And it’s starting to show up in places where blockchain’s real impact can be felt—education, healthcare, and secure identity systems. The Astra protocol is designed for efficiency, low fees, and fast confirmation times, making it ideal for building out high-traffic applications without gas headaches. This makes it a favorite among developers in Latin America where infrastructure is often stretched thin and high fees can be a blocker. Think about a school system in Lima using Astra to verify student credentials on-chain. Or a mobile app in Mexico City offering digital health passports and insurance tracking using smart contracts. This kind of localized, real-world integration is what’s giving Astra its edge—and helping it rank among the best cryptos for exponential returns over the coming years. It’s also being used in community-driven projects like municipal budgeting tools, allowing transparency and real-time feedback between citizens and their local governments. That kind of impact doesn’t just build credibility—it builds demand. And when platforms demand native tokens for services and security, utility kicks into high gear. Astra may not have Quant’s institutional flair or Qubetics’ ROI buzz, but it’s carving out a clear niche. Among developers, civil tech advocates, and grassroots crypto communities, it’s become the platform of choice. That kind of adoption? It’s not loud, but it’s sticky. Conclusion There’s a reason crypto continues to eat into traditional finance’s dominance—it offers freedom, speed, and innovation at a level the old system can’t match. And in the hunt for the best cryptos for exponential returns , it’s becoming clear that strong fundamentals and real-world impact are separating the contenders from the pretenders. Qubetics brings game-changing use cases through tokenized real-world assets, a booming presale, and eye-watering ROI forecasts. Quant offers backbone-level infrastructure that institutions trust. And Astra is quietly empowering the next wave of decentralized applications in underserved markets. For those still on the fence, here’s the thing: the doors to Qubetics’ presale aren’t going to stay open forever. Once $TICS hits major exchanges, the entry price—and the ROI potential—will shift. Meanwhile, Quant and Astra continue building strong foundations in their own lanes. Now’s the time to act. Don’t just watch the future of finance unfold—be part of it. Explore the platforms making headlines for all the right reasons. These aren’t just coins—they’re catalysts.

Threat Fabric analysts said in a March 28 report that the Crocodilus malware uses a screen overlay warning users to back up their crypto wallet key by a specific deadline or risk losing access. “Once a victim provides a password from the application, the overlay will display a message: Back up your wallet key in the settings within 12 hours. Otherwise, the app will be reset, and you may lose access to your wallet,” Threat Fabric said. “This social engineering trick guides the victim to navigate to their seed phrase wallet key, allowing Crocodilus to harvest the text using its accessibility logger.” Source: Threat Fabric Once the threat actors have the seed phrase, they can seize complete control of the wallet and “drain it completely.” Threat Fabric says despite it being a new malware, Crocodilus has all the features of modern banking malware, with overlay attacks, advanced data harvesting through screen capture of sensitive information such as passwords and remote access to take control of the infected device. Initial infection occurs by inadvertently downloading the malware in other software that bypasses Android 13 and security protections, according to Threat Fabric. Once installed, Crocodilus requests accessibility service to be enabled, which enables the hackers to gain access to the device. “Once granted, the malware connects to the command-and-control (C2) server to receive instructions, including the list of target applications and the overlays to be used,” Threat Fabric said. Once installed, Crocodilus requests accessibility service to be enabled, granting hackers access to the device. Source: Threat Fabric It runs continuously, monitoring app launches and displaying overlays to intercept credentials. When a targeted banking or cryptocurrency app is opened, the fake overlay launches over the top and mutes the sound while the hackers take control of the device. “With stolen PII and credentials, threat actors can take full control of a victim’s device using built-in remote access, completing fraudulent transactions without detection,” Threat Fabric said. Threat Fabrix’s Mobile Threat Intelligence team has found the malware targets users in Turkey and Spain but said the scope of use will likely broaden over time. Related: Beware of ‘cracked’ TradingView — it’s a crypto-stealing trojan They also speculate the developers could speak Turkish, based on the notes in the code, and added that a threat actor known as Sybra or another hacker testing out new software could be behind the malware. “The emergence of the Crocodilus mobile banking Trojan marks a significant escalation in the sophistication and threat level posed by modern malware.” “With its advanced Device-Takeover capabilities, remote control features, and the deployment of black overlay attacks from its earliest iterations, Crocodilus demonstrates a level of maturity uncommon in newly discovered threats,” Threat Fabric added.

I'm upgrading the stock to a buy rating. Altcoin prices have shown resilience relative to Bitcoin's sharper drop, which may mean Coinbase's trading revenue won't fall as much as feared. Continued innovation, such as Coinbase One Premium at $300/month and Bitcoin-backed loans, is driving growth in non-transactional recurring revenue streams. Coinbase has also fallen to a very attractive ~9x forward adjusted EBITDA multiple, quite a modest valuation for such a high-growth company. Just a few months ago, the sentiment around Coinbase ( COIN ) and the crypto industry immediately after Trump’s re-election was all euphoria. Crypto investors cheered Trump’s embrace of crypto and promise to make the U.S. the “world capital of crypto,” alongside more friendly regulatory expectations and the establishment of a U.S. crypto reserve. All of these promises still hold. And yet, Bitcoin has tumbled ~20% from peaks, magnifying losses in the S&P 500 and defying the traditional logic that crypto should be a low-correlation asset that can be used as a market hedge, like gold. And against that backdrop, Coinbase has lost 30% of its value since the start of January. Data by YCharts In my view, this is a good juncture for investors to re-assess the bull case for Coinbase. I last wrote a neutral opinion on the stock in January , when Coinbase was still trading near $260. Today, with the stock more than 30% lower, I believe the recent sharp drop has more than compensated Coinbase for any added risk from the recent market turmoil. Though long on the sidelines for this stock due in large part to valuation concerns, I’m much more bullish on Coinbase at its lower prices. As such, I’m upgrading the stock to a buy rating. To me, all the structural and regulatory factors that drove the post-election surge, such as the establishment of a federal crypto reserve, still hold - and we don’t rehash those long-term drivers here. We’ll focus instead on what makes Coinbase a good buy on the dip, based on what has recently changed for the company: relative stability of altcoin prices (relative to BTC), continued innovation that will help to boost Coinbase’s more reliable subscription/services revenue stream, and a more benign valuation. Let’s now go through each of these factors in turn. Q4 trading revenue was on fire; Q1 won’t be bad as feared For investors who are newer to Coinbase, note that the company generates revenue across two distinct streams. Roughly 70% of Coinbase’s revenue derives from the spreads it earns on facilitating trading, while the remaining 30% is a more reliable stream of revenue from subscription fees, mining rewards, custodial fees, and interest. We’ll focus first on the trading portion, which, needless to say, enjoyed a huge burst of activity in the post-election period. In the most recently reported quarter, Q4, Coinbase reported $1.56 billion of transactional revenue, up roughly 3x y/y. Coinbase Q4 results (Coinbase Q4 shareholder letter) Needless to say, this is the lion’s share of the company’s revenue, and given the strict volatility and unpredictability of this activity, Coinbase explicitly does not provide any guidance for this revenue line - it only provides an outlook for subscription/services revenue as well as its expense ratios. Coinbase’s sharp ~30% fall since the start of the year is a reflection of investors’ fear that the pullback in crypto markets (and in risk-taking in general) will dent the company’s recent blazing growth trends. And while it’s true that growth rates will likely decelerate meaningfully from the 194% y/y that the company achieved in Q4, it’s likely to be better than feared. First - in the company’s Q4 shareholder letter, the company noted that it already earned “approximately $750 million” in trading revenue through February 11, or 42 trading days of the 88-day quarter. Of course, trading is volatile, and market losses picked up in late February - but if we do a simple extrapolation of February trends through the remainder of the quarter, we’d get anywhere from $1.5-$1.6 billion in revenue for the quarter, roughly ~40-50% growth versus $1.08 billion in the prior-year Q1. In other words, recent trends through mid-quarter are still pointing to shape double-digit y/y growth rates in trading revenue. Second: it’s important to note that while the large and best-known coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum make up the lion’s share of trading activity on the platform, they’re not the biggest chunk of revenue. Coinbase actually makes higher spreads on smaller altcoins. See the chart below: for the full year FY24, 57% of Coinbase’s revenue came from “other crypto assets” (not specifically defined as BTC, ETH, or XRP), versus just a 43% share of trading volume. Coinbase trading share by type and coin (Coinbase Q4 shareholder letter) Why this is important is because in the recent correction, it appears that the largest altcoins have had relatively better price stability than Bitcoin. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is down ~20% from peaks at $103k. Ethereum is down more than 50% from December peaks, just shy of $4k. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) which in the fourth quarter grew to a 14% share of Coinbase’s trading revenue (a bit over half of Bitcoin’s share, and generating more revenue than Ethereum), is actually flat to where it started the year, though down from February peaks in the high $2s. XRP price chart ( CoinMarketCap ) BNB (the 5th largest coin with a ~$90 billion market cap) is only down ~10% from December/January levels in the high $600s. BNB price chart ( CoinMarketCap ) The point here is that, by and large, it seems that crypto assets outside of Bitcoin have enjoyed greater price stability in this downturn - and since these are the coins that generate wider spreads for Coinbase, the company’s trading revenue growth might not drop as sharply as feared. Continued innovation is driving subscription fees Beyond the hope of continued growth in trading revenue, we also like the fact that Coinbase continues to develop its capabilities to continue growing its non-transactional recurring revenue base. One major initiative is Coinbase One, the company’s subscription membership. Over the past year, Coinbase has introduced the premium membership in more countries, which has helped the company’s international revenue contribution climb to 19% in Q4, up 3 points y/y. Though it doesn’t provide regular subscriber metrics each quarter, the company notes that it has passed the 600k subscriber mark, up “more than 50%” since Q1 of 2024. The final y also recently unveiled a new Coinbase One Premium tier, priced at a hefty $300/month and giving users access to unlimited zero trading fees and richer USDC wallet rewards. This is an offering that caters to true crypto professional traders. Rewards for holding USDC are also new, giving users more incentive to purchase and hold the USD-backed stablecoin (while Coinbase earns lucrative interest spreads on funds held). Coinbase also recently released loans backed by Bitcoin, which is an innovative application of blockchain technology. Bitcoin holders now also have the opportunity to “leverage” their bitcoins held in Coinbase and receive U.S. dollar-based loans, allowing them to access liquidity without selling their holdings and triggering capital gains. The company also continues to step up its offerings for institutional clients, which have increasingly waded into the crypto markets and following the new administration’s direction that crypto will be favorably looked upon and regulated. Institutional volumes more than doubled y/y in Q4. Per CFO Alesia Hess’s remarks on the Q4 earnings call: Our institutional trading volume was $345 billion, up 128%, also outperforming the U.S. spot market. Institutional transaction revenue was $141 million, up 156%. In the fourth quarter, we saw strong adoption of the Prime product suite. Across custody, trading, financing, and staking, our top clients are engaged with most of these products in 2024, and our onboarding pipeline remains robust. Our Prime financing product had all-time high loan balances in the fourth quarter in connection with the strong market conditions, and we see elevated trading amongst clients who are using financing.” In my view, all of these moves (especially the rollout of a professional-tier Coinbase One subscription) will help to diversify Coinbase’s revenue into steadier streams that reduce its dependence on volatile consumer trading. Valuation, risks, and key takeaways The biggest impetus to buy Coinbase now, however, is the fact that its valuation finally appears to have fallen to very reasonable levels. At current share prices near $174, Coinbase trades at a $44.16 billion market cap. After we net off the $9.82 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and USDC on Coinbase’s most recent balance sheet (and not counting ~$1.55 billion of other crypto assets held for investment) against $4.23 billion in debt, Coinbase’s resulting enterprise value is $38.57 billion. For FY25, Wall Street is currently expecting Coinbase to generate $8.12 billion in revenue, or 24% y/y growth. If we assume a 51% adjusted EBITDA margin on this revenue profile (a conservative assumption of flat margins to FY24), adjusted EBITDA would be $4.14 billion (+24% y/y). This puts Coinbase’s valuation multiples at: 4.8x EV/FY25 revenue 9.3x EV/FY25 adjusted EBITDA To me, a single-digit EBITDA multiple for a company that is on track to sustain double-digit growth in revenue this year, with plenty of secular tailwind for greater crypto adoption (particularly by institutions) is quite compelling. Of course, there are risks we need to keep in mind. The crypto community has long embraced a buy-and-hold (or “hodl”) mentality during downturns. Despite my earlier assertion that altcoins’ price has dipped more modestly compared to bitcoin, the nervous market environment overall could persuade more crypto owners to simply hold their positions rather than trade, reducing trading volumes and Coinbase’s revenue. This being said, however, I like the continued expansion of Coinbase’s non-trading revenue streams, and to me, risks are already more than embedded into the stock’s currently discounted price.

MARA Holdings, formerly Marathon Digital, said in a March 28 Form 8-K and prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it entered into an at-the-market agreement with investment giants, including Cantor Fitzgerald and Barclays, for them to sell up to $2 billion worth of its stock “from time to time.” “We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital,” MARA added. MARA’s move copies a tactic made famous by Bitcoin ( BTC ) bull Saylor, the executive chair of the largest corporate Bitcoin holder Strategy , formerly MicroStrategy, which has used a variety of market offerings, including stock sales, to amass 506,137 BTC worth $42.4 billion. MARA Holdings falls just behind Strategy with the second largest holdings by a public company, with 46,374 BTC worth around $3.9 billion in its coffers, according to Bitbo data. In July, the company’s CEO, Fred Thiel, said it was going “full HODL” and wouldn’t sell any of the Bitcoin it mined to fund its operations, as is typical for crypto miners, and would purchase more of the cryptocurrency to keep in reserve. Related: Crusoe to sell Bitcoin mining business to NYDIG to focus on AI The Bitcoin ( BTC ) miner’s planned stock sale follows a similar offering it made early last year that offered up to $1.5 billion worth of its shares. It also issued $1 billion of zero-coupon convertible senior notes in November with plans to use most of the proceeds to buy Bitcoin. Google Finance shows that MARA closed the March 28 trading day down 8.58% at $12.47, following on from crypto mining stocks being rattled a day earlier with reports that Microsoft abandoned plans to invest in new data centers in the US and Europe. MARA shares have fallen another 4.6% to $11.89 in overnight trading on March 30, according to Robinhood.

This follows a breakdown from consolidation, which has shifted the overall market sentiment toward ADA tokens. Cardano (ADA) Price Action and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA has finally turned bearish and is poised to continue its price decline in the coming days. This shift in sentiment follows the breakdown of a consolidation phase that ADA has been experiencing between the $0.69 and $0.75 levels for several weeks. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, there is a strong possibility that ADA could see a 5% price drop until it reaches the $0.625 level. Meanwhile, if the decline continues and a daily candle closes below the $0.622 level, there is a strong possibility that ADA’s price could plummet by 30% until it reaches the $0.425 level. As of now, ADA is trading below the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating a bearish trend and weak price action for the asset. Current Price Momentum Despite these fluctuations, ADA is currently trading near $0.66, having recorded a price decline of over 1% in the past 24 hours. Meanwhile, during the same period, the asset’s trading volume dropped by 30%, indicating lower participation from traders and investors compared to previous days. Key Liquidation Levels With this bearish price action and continuous decline, traders’ market sentiment remains unchanged as they continue to favor the bearish side.

The newspaper Chosun Ilbo reported that a branch of the Busan District Court’s Criminal Division sent the ringleader of the operation to jail for four and half years. The court found the trio guilty of fraud and violating the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes. South Korean Court: More Crypto Scammers Jailed The court heard that the ringleader was the CEO of an “investment” firm. This firm, said prosecutors, duped victims into thinking they would receive monthly payments worth 30% of their original stakes. The Busan District Court in Busan, South Korea. (Source: Busan District Court/Facebook) The presiding judge jailed two other officials (both unnamed for legal reasons). The judge jailed one for three and a half years, and the other for two years and six months. Prosecutors explained that the CEO and the other two officials “established an investment company in a building in Busan in June 2019.” The ring, the prosecution service explained, told would-be investors that they would “select and trade” holdings in around 1,000 “high-quality” altcoins on the investors’ behalf. @GooglePlay blocks 17 unregistered crypto apps in South Korea, targeting foreign exchanges like KuCoin and MEXC, as the FIU enforces strict compliance with local regulations. #CryptoRegulation #SouthKorea https://t.co/M9UoZ8w1dV — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) March 26, 2025 The coins, the group said, were “hand-picked” projects based in countries “all over the world.” This method, they promised, would ensure that investors received monthly payments of 30% of their stakes. However, the investors were advised to keep their funds on the gang’s “platform,” rather than make withdrawals. Instead, the prosecution service continued, the group proceeded to embezzle a total of 610 million won.

The arrest comes amid reports of a rise in crypto-related fraud cases. Last year, prosecutors revealed details of cases involving fraudsters who targeted crypto scam victims by posing as regulators.

The March 30 hack was initially detected by blockchain security firms TenArmorAlert and Decurity , both of which posted warnings on X to alert users of the protocol. The protocol’s founder, known only as Xatarrer, described the hack as “the worst news a protocol could received [sic],” but suggested the team intends to try to keep the protocol going despite the setback. Source: SIR.trading on X “Clever attack” targeted contract vault Decurity described the hack as a “clever attack” that targeted a callback function used in the protocol’s “vulnerable contract Vault” which leverages Ethereum’s transient storage feature. According to Decurity, the attacker was able to replace the real Uniswap pool address used in this callback function with an address under the hacker’s control, allowing them to redirect the funds in the vault to their address. TenArmorAlert further explained that by repeatedly calling this callback function, the attacker was able to fully drain the protocol’s TVL. Source: Decurity SupLabsYi, from blockchain security firm Supremacy, went into more detail on the attack in an X post, stating it may demonstrate a security flaw in Ethereum’s transient storage. Transient storage was added to Ethereum with last year’s Dencun upgrade. The new feature allows for temporary storage of data leading to lower gas fees than regular storage. According to SupLabsYi, it’s still a “nascent feature,” and the attack may be one of the first to exploit its vulnerabilities. “This isn’t merely a threat aimed at a single instance of uniswapV3SwapCallback,” SupLabsYi said. TenArmorSecurity said the stolen funds have now been deposited into an address funded through the Ethereum privacy solution Railgun. Xatarrer has since reached out to Railgun for assistance. Related: DeFi hacks drop 40% in 2024, CeFi breaches surge to $694M — Hacken SIR.trading’s documentation shows that it was billed as “a new DeFi protocol for safer leverage.” The stated purpose of the protocol was to address some of the challenges of leveraged trading, “such as volatility decay and liquidation risks, making it safer for long-term investing.” While it aimed for safer leveraged trading, the protocol’s documentation did warn users that despite being audited, its smart contracts could still contain bugs that could lead to financial losses — highlighting the platform’s vaults as a particular area of vulnerability. “Undiscovered bugs or exploits in SIR’s smart contracts could lead to fund losses. These might stem from complex logic in vault mechanics or leverage calculations that audits failed to catch, exposing users to rare but critical failures,” the project’s documentation states.

The crypto market’s downturn is being driven by weak demand in spot markets and a clear shift toward derisking, with traders hesitant to take new positions.

It’s not just about luck—it’s about timing. While Pudgy Penguins rides the NFT wave and Snek slithers through Cardano with purpose, one name is changing the playbook for early gains and smart rewards— BTFD Coin (BTFD) . BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token on the block. It’s a next-gen community-backed crypto revolution that’s making serious waves with its blazing-hot presale. Sitting in Stage 15 at just $0.0002, this is your chance to double up on tokens with the LAUNCH100 bonus code , ending March 30. With a jaw-dropping 2900% ROI potential at its projected moon price of $0.006 and a referral program that pays you to bring your crew, BTFD is hands down the most exciting pick among the top new meme coins to join today. BTFD Coin – Built Different, Backed by Bulls, and Bursting With Rewards Here’s a thought: What if you didn’t just invest in a coin but joined a movement—one built around community power, early adopter perks, and the best damn dip in crypto history? That’s exactly what BTFD Coin brings. With its 15th presale stage now live, over 72 billion tokens already sold, more than 11,600 holders, and $6.43 million raised, BTFD isn’t waiting for a bull run—it’s building one. Let’s break it down. Right now, you can still grab BTFD tokens at $0.0002. Use the promo code LAUNCH100 and you’ll get double the tokens. That’s a 100% bonus. Drop $2,000 right now? That nets you 10 million tokens, but with the bonus code, you’re walking away with 20 million BTFD coins. When it hits its listing price of $0.0006, that’s already $12,000. But here’s the kicker: analysts are eyeing a moon price of $0.006—meaning your $2,000 could turn into $120,000. No games. Just timing. And speaking of games, BTFD isn’t just about HODLing. The full version of its Play-to-Earn game launched on January 1, 2025. It’s live, it’s rewarding, and it’s fun. Run with the Bulls Squad, conquer levels, and earn crypto while you play. That’s the kind of utility most meme coins can only dream of. There’s also staking, which went live on December 2, 2024. Park your tokens and earn a wild 90% APY. It’s built for bulls who want to play long and smart. This meme coin presale isn’t gonna sit at the current price forever. With just one stage left before the launch price hits $0.0006, you’re looking at your last window to get in early. Make your move or miss the moonshot. Pudgy Penguins – The NFT Darling with Crypto Clout Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) made waves as one of the earliest NFT brands to break into mainstream retail. With physical toys in 10,000+ stores and an ETF filing that blends NFTs with crypto, PENGU’s become more than a meme—it’s a brand. Its massive community, slick branding, and NFT-fueled governance token give it staying power as one of the top new meme coins to join today. For crypto users looking for a mix of digital art and blockchain utility, Pudgy Penguins delivers. The project blends collectible hype with real-world reach, which is why it continues to stay relevant even when other NFTs fizzle out. But PENGU isn’t in presale, and those early gains? Gone. That’s where BTFD’s got the edge. Snek – Cardano’s Meme Coin with a Mission Over on the Cardano blockchain, Snek (SNEK) has carved a name for itself by leaning into grassroots hype and decentralized vibes. It’s a symbol of community strength, building trust through consistent delivery and meme-savvy culture. SNEK’s known for its low fees, green-chain alignment, and native liquidity. It’s caught fire within the Cardano ecosystem and built up a strong base of supporters. If you’re already rolling with ADA, SNEK probably popped up on your radar. It’s a meme coin with a pulse—but again, it’s already live. BTFD, meanwhile, is still in its high-reward entry phase, which puts it at the top of our top new meme coins to join today list. Time to Double Down – BTFD’s Referral Program and Bonus Code Explained So here’s the juicy part, the Bulls care about—the double token deal and monthly cash incentives. When you buy using code LAUNCH100, every BTFD coin you grab is instantly doubled. That means more to stake, more to play, more to hold. And if you’re out here pushing the BTFD movement? You get paid too. Connect your wallet at the BTFD site , grab your referral code, and start sharing it. Anyone who uses your code and buys $50+ gets 10% more tokens, and you—if you make it into the top 20—earn 10% of their raise amount in BTFD coins. This offer runs until March 30, 6 PM UTC, then resets on April 1. This isn’t your average crypto airdrop. This is a movement that rewards its community, fuels growth from within, and creates real value. So whether you’re a casual investor or someone with a whole Telegram squad, this program’s got serious potential. Final Words – You’re Either In or You’re Watching Others Win In a market where timing is everything, BTFD Coin gives you all the tools to win early. Between the 90% APY staking, live P2E game, 2900% ROI potential, and the killer referral program, it’s clearly not your average meme coin. Snek and Pudgy Penguins are cool. No doubt. But they’re established, and their high-reward entry window closed a while back. BTFD? It’s still wide open, and it’s closing fast. That’s why it leads our list of the top new meme coins to join today. If you want in before Stage 16 and that sweet 2x bonus vanishes, now’s the time. Don’t sleep on the next big moonshot. Join the BTFD Coin presale now. Lock in your 100% bonus before March 30. Stack. Stake. Game. Repeat.

ETH is now consolidating and remains at risk of more losses. Ethereum struggled to continue higher above the $2,000 resistance level. The price is trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,820 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair must clear the $1,820 and $1,880 resistance levels to start a decent increase. Ethereum Price Dips Again Ethereum price failed to continue higher above $2,100 and started another decline, like Bitcoin . ETH declined below the $1,920 and $1,880 support levels. It tested the $1,765 zone. A low was formed at $1,767 and the price recently attempted a fresh upward move.

Ethereum price is now trading below $1,880 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average . There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1,820 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,820 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,880 level and the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $2,033 swing high to the $1,767 low. The first major resistance is near the $1,920 level. A clear move above the $1,920 resistance might send the price toward the $2,000 resistance. An upside break above the $2,000 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $2,050 resistance zone or even $2,120 in the near term. More Losses In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,880 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,780 level. The first major support sits near the $1,765 zone. A clear move below the $1,765 support might push the price toward the $1,720 support.

Since launching on Mar. 20, the platform has generated $5.4 million in protocol fees, attracted 700,000 active wallets, and enabled 30.59 million swaps, according to data from Dune Analytics. Although Raydium ( RAY ) still held 74% of the market share as of Mar. 30, PumpSwap has rapidly gained traction, making up 8% of Solana’s ( SOL ) total DEX trading volume. PumpSwap was created by Pump.fun to make trading memecoins and providing liquidity easier. Previously, memecoins launched on Pump.fun migrated to Raydium after completing the bonding curve. PumpSwap removes this extra step by combining trading, liquidity, and token creation on a single platform, enabling quick and free migrations. Like Raydium v4 and Uniswap ( UNI ) v2, the platform uses a constant product automated market maker model and bases pricing on liquidity pools rather than order books. You might also like: MUBARAK hype fades as memecoin plunges 40% in a day, nearing launch price Pump.fun originally charged a six-SOL migration fee to Raydium, but PumpSwap replaced this with a 0.25% trading fee, of which 0.20% goes to liquidity providers and 0.05% to the protocol. This structure is expected to evolve once Creator Revenue Sharing is introduced. PumpSwap’s early adoption was recently boosted by an integration with MEXC, a leading cryptocurrency exchange. On Mar.25, MEXC announced that PumpSwap would be supported by its DEX+ aggregator. MEXC’s 34 million+ users in 170 countries can now easily access tokens on the platform through the MEXC app and website, making it the first aggregator to support direct trading of PumpSwap-listed tokens. This move will potentially help in drawing in more liquidity and traders to the platform. As the memecoin frenzy cools, Solana’s total DEX volume has dropped sharply, from $258 billion in January to just $50 billion in March, as per DefiLlama data .

Will SUI price falter?,https://crypto.news/151m-in-sui-to-be-unlocked-this-week-will-sui-price-falter/,"Sui is set for a major supply event, with 64.19 million SUI tokens worth approximately $148.29 million scheduled for release on April 1, sparking concerns about potential selling pressure and its impact on SUI price. According to data from Tokenimist, this unlock represents 2.03% of the Sui’s ( SUI ) circulating supply, which currently stands at 3.17 billion SUI. Nevertheless, only 31.7% of the entire 10 billion maximum supply has been unlocked, indicating that more emissions are expected in the future. There has also been substantial movement in Sui’s decentralized finance ecosystem. The monthly decentralized exchange trading volume reached $5 billion, and the stablecoin market capitalization has nearly doubled from $370 million in December to $628 million as of Mar. 31. Amidst the crypto market downturn, Sui’s total value locked has decreased, falling from a peak of $2.08 billion in January to $1.2 billion, as per DefiLlama data .

The next important resistance levels are $2.64 and $2.78 if the price rises above this level. The closest support level on the downside is $2.23. A decline to $2.00 might occur if selling pressure increases. SUI technical analysis. Credit: crypto.news Technical indicators indicate momentum that is neutral to slightly bearish. The Relative Strength Index, at 44.5, shows weak buying interest, while the MACD is still negative, suggesting ongoing sell pressure. However, the Stochastic RSI is getting close to the oversold area, indicating a possible short-term rebound. Following the impending token unlock, SUI may see brief volatility as traders react to the increased supply. Consolidation and a retest of $2.37 may ensue if buyers protect the $2.23 support. A break below this mark, though, could result in additional declines toward $2.00. However, positive ecosystem developments like Canary Capital’s SUI-linked exchange traded fund filing and the blockchain recently surpassing 100 million total accounts, may boost sentiment. SUI may surge past $2.37 and test $2.64 in the upcoming weeks if buying interest outweighs selling pressure.

Even though volume is down 6%, it’s holding up better than Bitcoin, where trading volume has dropped by 37%. Recently, XRP dropped to a key support zone between $1.95 and $2.10. This level has been important in the past, and it’s holding well so far. Crypto analyst Josh from Crypto World shared an update on XRP’s price action. According to him, XRP is showing a slight bullish bounce. This comes after an oversold signal in the RSI (Relative Strength Index), suggesting that XRP was due for a short-term relief rally. This bounce or sideways movement is expected to last for the next day or two. Josh explains that an oversold signal isn’t a bottom signal—it just means the price needs some kind of reset in the short term. This oversold condition coincided with XRP’s price getting very close to major support, which is why the price has seen this slight bounce. The next key support level to watch is between $1.50 and $1.25, and XRP bounced from just about $1.26, just one cent away from that area. If the short-term bounce continues, resistance is expected around the previous support zone, now acting as resistance, between $2.24 and $2.30. If XRP manages to break above $2.30, the next resistance levels are around $2.48 and $2.56. SEC Closed Door Meeting (April 3): The SEC has scheduled a private meeting to talk about legal actions, administrative proceedings, and enforcement issues. According to reports, this meeting could help clarify XRP’s regulatory situation, especially regarding the approval of XRP-spot ETFs.

California’s Assembly Bill 1052 was introduced as the Money Transmission Act on Feb. 20, 2025, but was amended by Democrat and Banking and Finance Committee chair Avelino Valencia on March 28 to include several Bitcoin ( BTC ) and crypto-related investor protections. The amendments cross out “Money Transmission Act,” with the legislation now called “Digital assets.” “California often sets the national blueprint for policy, and if Bitcoin Rights passes here, it can pass anywhere,” Satoshi Action Fund CEO Dennis Porter said in a March 30 statement. “Once passed, this legislation will guarantee nearly 40 million Californians the right to self-custody their digital assets without fear of discrimination.” Source: Satoshi Action Fund The bill would also deem the use of a digital financial asset as a valid and legal form of payment in private transactions and would prohibit public entities from restricting or taxing digital assets solely based on their use as payment. The bill would also expand the scope of California’s Political Reform Act of 1974 to prohibit a public official from issuing, sponsoring or promoting a digital asset, security or commodity. “A public official shall not engage in any transaction or conduct related to a digital asset that creates a conflict of interest with their public duties,” one section of the AB 1052 states. AB 1052 is now in the “desk process” — meaning the bill has been formally introduced and is awaiting its first reading. A total of 99 merchants currently accept Bitcoin payments in California, BTC Maps data shows. Ripple Labs, Solana Labs and Kraken are among the largest crypto firms based in California. Related: New BITCOIN Act would allow US reserve to exceed 1M A stablecoin-related bill was also introduced in California on Feb. 2, 2025, which aims to provide more clarity over stablecoin collateral requirements, liquidation processes, redemption and settlement mechanisms requirements and security audits. Bitcoin-related bills and measures near 100 at the US state level According to Bitcoin Law, 95 Bitcoin-related bills or measures have been introduced at the state level in 35 states, including 36 Bitcoin reserve bills that are still live. The Texas Senate passed a Bitcoin strategic reserve bil l in a 25-5 vote on March 6, while Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear signed a Bitcoin Rights bill into law on March 24. Earlier this month, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve and a Digital Asset Stockpile, both of which will initially use cryptocurrency forfeited in government criminal cases.

The trio ran a deceptive operation from Busan under the guise of an investment firm, luring people with false promises of high monthly returns. The ringleader, identified as the company’s CEO, received a four-and-a-half-year jail term. Two other members, whose names remain undisclosed for legal reasons, were sentenced to three and a half years and two years and six months, respectively. The verdict was delivered by a branch of the Busan District Court’s Criminal Division, which found all three guilty of fraud and breaching the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes. Fake firm promised 30% returns According to prosecutors, the fraudulent investment company was set up in June 2019 in a Busan office building. Victims were persuaded to invest in “hand-picked” crypto projects that the scammers claimed were carefully selected from across the globe. The gang promised consistent returns of 30% per month on initial stakes—an unusually high figure that played a key role in convincing investors. Victims were instructed to keep their funds within the group’s “platform” and discouraged from withdrawing. This method helped the scammers maintain control over the invested funds while continuing to recruit new investors using similar tactics. The court ruled that the operation was designed to take advantage of individuals who had limited or no knowledge of crypto investments. The presiding judge noted that the defendants “committed crimes by taking advantage of the victims’ lack of knowledge about crypto investment,” describing the scheme as “deplorable.” Embezzlement mirrors wider trends The Busan-based scam is one of several recent high-profile fraud cases in South Korea involving the misuse of crypto platforms. Prosecutors highlighted that the group’s approach—promising guaranteed returns and discouraging withdrawals—reflected broader patterns used by other fraudulent operators across the country. Earlier this month, South Korean prosecutors arrested a major crypto market maker on separate scam coin-related charges. Though unrelated to the Busan case, the arrest is part of a growing crackdown on illicit crypto activities by law enforcement agencies. There is growing concern that many of these schemes specifically target individuals unfamiliar with cryptocurrency markets. Prosecutors in recent cases have consistently pointed to a lack of investor education as a key factor that scammers exploit. Victims targeted twice In a disturbing trend, victims of crypto scams are being further exploited by criminals posing as regulatory officials. In one previously reported case, a group of fraudsters contacted individuals who had already been defrauded, pretending to be investigators or legal officers. These impostors allegedly demanded payments of 5,000 USDT (Tether) as “investigation fees” to recover their lost funds. This tactic allowed scammers to extract even more money from people already suffering losses, further complicating the legal and emotional aftermath for victims. Prosecutors have not linked this secondary scam to the Busan case, but its emergence underscores the evolving tactics being used in South Korea’s crypto fraud landscape. Crackdown on crypto fraud grows The sentencing of the three Busan-based scammers adds to a growing list of prosecutions as South Korean authorities strengthen their enforcement of economic crime laws related to cryptocurrency. With an increase in investor participation in digital assets, the legal system is responding with stricter penalties and wider investigations. The Busan court’s ruling highlights the importance of regulation and investor education in deterring financial crimes in the crypto market. Although crypto remains a legitimate and fast-growing industry in South Korea, fraudulent schemes like this threaten investor trust and market stability. Authorities continue to warn the public to remain cautious of investment opportunities that promise abnormally high returns or discourage transparency.

Considering the comparison between BTC and US equity indices like Nasdaq and S&P 500, they appear to be forming a Death Cross in the coming weeks, hinting at a potential bearish momentum ahead. Analysts are curious as to whether BTC will finally crash under $80K, before resuing any upside move ahead. What Happens to Bitcoin Price Next, Along With S&P 500, and Nasdaq? Over the past several years, Bitcoin performance has been closely linked to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices. During the last three trading sessions from Wednesday to Friday, the S&P 500 has eroded a massive $2 trillion of investors’ wealth. The sell-off didn’t stop there—after the markets closed on Friday, S&P 500 futures plunged further, erasing an additional $120 billion within minutes, as per The Kobeissi Letter. Source: The Kobeissi Letter Despite a brief relief rally in mid-March, the rally was undone as soon as Trump imposed 25% auto tariffs. Bitcoin price also faced a similar scenario after attempting a rally past $90,000, however, it faced strong rejection at $89,000. Trump tariffs on Russia further threaten pushing Bitcoin under $80,000. As per Barchart data, BTC, along with S&P 500 and Nasdaq, is forming a death cross pattern. Analysts are speculating on the market behavior leading up to this technical event, questioning whether price declines ahead of these Death Crosses might mark a market bottom. Historical patterns have occasionally shown such setups, with the actual cross aligning with the end of a downward trend. Thus, we can see some major volatility this week ahead. Source: Barchart Popular economist Peter Schiff took this moment to criticize Bitcoin’s status as Digital Gold adding: “Gold is trading in new record territory again this evening. Gold is above $3,090 for the first time, with a new record high so far tonight of $3,097. In contrast, risk assets like stocks and Bitcoin are selling off again. If you still think Bitcoin is digital gold, think again”. Is BTC Following Global M2 Money Supply? While there’s been a strong ongoing narrative that Bitcoin price will rally along with global M2 money supply, crypto analyst Ali Martinez says that investors should approach this with caution. Martinez countered this claim by pointing out a significant trend in global money supply. According to the analyst, the global money supply has actually dropped by nearly $1 trillion over the past two weeks. Thus, he casts doubt on the expectations of a liquidity-driven bullish outlook for Bitcoin. Additionally, analyst Ali Martinez also reported a significant sell-off by Bitcoin miners over the past week. According to Martinez, miners offloaded more than 2,400 BTC during this period, amounting to approximately $220 million.

Speaking at an America PAC town hall in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Musk dismissed rumors linking Dogecoin to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative he is leading. “There are no plans for the government to use Dogecoin or anything, as far as I know,” Musk stated. Initially, Musk intended to name the initiative the Government Efficiency Commission but opted for the Department of Government Efficiency after public feedback. “I was going to call it the Government Efficiency Commission, but that’s a super boring name,” he remarked. Streamlining Government Operations The DOGE initiative, established by President Trump, aims to improve government efficiency by 15%. Musk emphasized the program’s focus on cost-cutting rather than cryptocurrency adoption. Despite its coincidental acronym, the project has no ties to Dogecoin, a meme cryptocurrency Musk has frequently supported. His enthusiasm for Dogecoin has led to confusion regarding his role in the government’s efficiency efforts. Musk’s Planned Departure Musk confirmed he would step down from his role in the Trump administration after achieving a $1 trillion reduction in the federal deficit. He estimates this goal could be accomplished within 130 days, potentially ending his tenure by May. Under Musk’s leadership, DOGE has aggressively reduced spending, including cutting excessive federal credit card distribution. He called the discovery of 4.6 million government-issued cards “absurd” and pushed for immediate action. While some praise Musk’s reforms, critics argue the initiative wields too much power without proper oversight.

As part of this effort, the company announced Monday it had issued 2b yen (about $13.3m) in zero-interest ordinary bonds . These proceeds, it said, will be used exclusively to purchase additional Bitcoin. The bond issuance, approved during a board meeting on March 31, supports Metaplanet’s broader push to position Bitcoin as a central pillar in its corporate treasury. *Metaplanet Issues 2 Billion JPY in 0% Ordinary Bonds to Purchase Additional $BTC * pic.twitter.com/ZrC5plI1Nc — Metaplanet Inc. (@Metaplanet_JP) March 31, 2025 Metaplanet Taps Stock Proceeds to Cover Bonds Notably, all bonds will be allocated to EVO FUND and carry no interest, with full redemption scheduled for Sept. 30, 2025. However, early redemption is permitted under specific conditions, giving the bondholder some flexibility. To fund redemption, Metaplanet plans to use proceeds generated through exercising its existing stock acquisition rights, a mechanism detailed in its Jan. 2025 filings. The company says the financial impact on its 2025 earnings will be limited—but the strategic implications are far more telling. Eric Trump Joins Metaplanet’s Advisory Board Meanwhile, Metaplanet has been steadily transforming into a Bitcoin-aligned company, taking cues from US-based MicroStrategy. It began acquiring BTC in April 2024 and currently holds 3,200 Bitcoin —worth about $260.8m. Looking ahead, it has set an even more ambitious public goal to build a 10,000 BTC reserve before end 2025. The company sees Bitcoin as a hedge against Japan’s prolonged economic headwinds, including currency volatility and mounting national debt. Anchoring its balance sheet in BTC, Metaplanet is betting on long-term strength in decentralized assets rather than fiat stability. Earlier this month, Metaplanet added firepower to its advisory team by appointing Eric Trump , a known crypto advocate, as the first member of its newly formed Strategic Board of Advisors. Trump’s inclusion, the company said, would accelerate its mission of driving Bitcoin adoption.

DOGE is declining and might test the $0.150 support zone. DOGE price started a fresh decline below the $0.1850 and $0.1750 levels. The price is trading below the $0.1750 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.170 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could extend losses if it breaks the $0.1620 support zone. Dogecoin Price Dips Further Dogecoin price started a fresh decline after it failed to clear $0.200, like Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE dipped below the $0.1880 and $0.1820 support levels. The bears were able to push the price below the $0.1750 support level. It even traded close to the $0.1620 support. A low was formed at $0.1628 and the price is now consolidating losses below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2057 swing high to the $0.1628 low. Dogecoin price is now trading below the $0.1750 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.170 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.170 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.1730 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.1770 level. A close above the $0.1770 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1850 resistance. The 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.2057 swing high to the $0.1628 low is also near the $0.1850 zone. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.1880 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.1950. More Losses In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.1770 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1635 level. The next major support is near the $0.1620 level. The main support sits at $0.1550. If there is a downside break below the $0.1550 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1320 level or even $0.120 in the near term. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now below the 50 level.

Popcat just exploded back onto the TikTok scene, and PEPE’s massive 420.69 trillion supply is making headlines across Ethereum communities. Whether it’s the viral “O-face” cat memes or nostalgic frog energy from the 2000s, this week has been wild for meme coins—and the momentum hasn’t slowed down. But there’s one name quietly racking up millions that might just overshadow them all. Over the last few years, meme coins have proven time and again they’re more than a joke. From Gen Z TikTok trends to serious investor plays, they’ve transformed into cultural phenomena with the power to make portfolios pop. And now? BTFD Coin is on deck with one of the strongest cases for breakout success this year. With a Play-to-Earn game already live, 90% APY staking, and a vibrant community called the Bulls Squad, it’s not just another meme coin—it’s the meme coin moment. The best part? Its referral program is minting new winners every day. BTFD Coin’s Referral Program Is Paying Bulls in a Big Way Can a meme coin really offer $180,000 returns on a $6,000 buy-in? When it’s BTFD Coin, that’s not clickbait—it’s math. At just $0.0002 right now in Stage 15 of its meme coin presale , a $6,000 investment nabs you 30 million BTFD tokens. Once the listing price hits $0.0006, that’s $18,000. But if BTFD hits its predicted moon price of $0.006, that’s $180,000—and that’s without even using the LAUNCH100 code that doubles your tokens. BTFD Coin has already raised over $6.44 million, with more than 72 billion coins sold and 11,600+ Bulls riding the hype. As one of the top new meme coins to invest in March 2025 , this isn’t some slow-crawl presale—it’s barreling toward its 16th and final stage, and today’s the last day to use the LAUNCH100 bonus code. Use it, and your $6,000 buy becomes 60 million tokens, pushing your potential moonbag to $360,000. The referral program only adds more juice. Among the top new meme coins to invest in March 2025, BTFD also rewards its top 20 referrers with 10% of the total BTFD purchased through their code, dished out at the end of the month. Friends who use your code also get 10% more tokens on top of their buy. It’s a win-win—and a huge flex. How to buy? Simple. Start with a bullish wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Load it with ETH, BNB, or USDT. Head to the BTFD buy page , connect your wallet, enter the LAUNCH100 bonus code (in ALL CAPS), choose your purchase amount, and confirm. Stake your tokens and watch rewards stack while the rest of the market sleeps on what could be the top new meme coins to invest in March 2025. But what really sets BTFD apart is its community-first P2E game that launched on January 1, 2025. Players earn $BTFD just for playing and dominating leaderboards. This isn’t some future promise—it’s live, it’s rewarding, and it’s adding fuel to a fire that was already hot. Popcat’s Meme Resurgence Fueled by TikTok Hype Popcat (POPCAT) is clawing back into the spotlight in the most 2025 way possible: viral TikTok soundtracks and filters. Born from a meme that took the internet by storm back in 2020, this cat-faced coin has roared back into relevance thanks to TikTok creators using Popcat’s iconic open-mouthed face for reaction videos, remix edits, and gaming overlays. Unlike most meme coins trying to force a narrative, Popcat has always leaned into absurdity, and it’s working. There’s zero utility, no roadmap, no fluff—and that’s exactly why it resonates. Traders, influencers, and online communities are embracing POPCAT as the “chaotic neutral” of meme crypto. It’s fun, it’s weird, and it thrives in the space where viral trends meet speculative mania. POPCAT is riding high on exchange volume spikes and trending hashtags. Meme coins with strong cultural hooks have a habit of exploding, and Popcat is very much riding the wave that carried early Shiba Inu and Dogecoin enthusiasts to meme coin fame. PEPE Still Going Strong With a Supply That Turns Heads PEPE is sticking to its roots while commanding serious attention. With 420.69 trillion tokens minted on Ethereum and a no-tax, no-utility policy, this coin is leaning fully into the meme ethos—simplicity, speed, and supply dominance. And oddly enough? That’s exactly what keeps the community growing. The current buzz comes from a new wave of transparent whale purchases and renewed interest in hyper-supply tokens that are easy to acquire in bulk. As other tokens struggle to define use cases, PEPE wears its no-utility badge proudly, and the market is rewarding it for that clarity. Traders looking to scoop up trillions of tokens for cheap love its simplicity. PEPE’s Ethereum roots, community-driven growth, and legacy meme status make it a coin to watch—especially as new investors try to ride the next cultural shift in crypto. It’s fast becoming one of the most recognized names in the meme coin class of 2023–2025. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin, Popcat, and PEPE are three of the top new meme coins to invest in March 2025, each offering a different flavor of meme coin mania. Popcat has the viral power, PEPE brings the supply shock nostalgia, and BTFD? It brings everything—a live P2E game, 90% APY staking, and a referral system that literally pays you to spread the word. But let’s be real—only one of these is still in presale, sitting at just $0.0002, with 2900% ROI potential to a moon price of $0.006. The referral program and 100% bonus code both end tonight, and this is likely the last time to stack that kind of upside at this price. No more stalling. Join the BTFD Coin presale now , use the LAUNCH100 code, and either grow your stack or regret not owning the dip when it mattered. FAQs What is the current price of BTFD Coin and how high can it go? BTFD Coin is currently priced at $0.0002 in Stage 15 of its meme coin presale, with analysts projecting a moon price of $0.006—offering up to 2900% ROI potential. How does the BTFD referral program work? If your code makes it into the top 20 leaderboard, you receive 10% of every BTFD purchase made using it. Your referrals also get 10% more tokens. Is it still possible to use the LAUNCH100 code? Yes, but only until March 30, 2025—TONIGHT. The code doubles your BTFD tokens, making this the final chance to grab 2x rewards before it’s gone.

CoinFund's managing partner David Pakman recently projected that the global stablecoin supply could surge to $1 trillion by the end of 2025, driven by increasing onchain capital movement and rising adoption for everyday payments. At the same time, blockchain firm Sonic Labs has canceled plans to launch a US dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, opting instead to develop a UAE dirham-based alternative amid growing regulatory scrutiny and market concerns over algorithmic models. Stablecoin Supply Could Soar to $1 Trillion by End of 2025, Says CoinFund's David Pakman The global stablecoin market is poised for exponential growth, potentially reaching a staggering $1 trillion in supply by the end of 2025, according to David Pakman, managing partner at crypto-focused investment firm CoinFund. Pakman believes this surge could become one of the most significant catalysts for broader cryptocurrency adoption and decentralized finance (DeFi) expansion over the next year. “We’re in a stablecoin adoption upswell that’s likely to increase dramatically this year,” Pakman stated. “We could go from $225 billion stablecoins to $1 trillion just this calendar year.” While a trillion-dollar stablecoin market would still be modest compared to the multi-trillion-dollar traditional financial markets, Pakman underscored that such growth would mark a “meaningfully significant” shift in blockchain-based finance. He noted that the capital inflow would not only serve as a bridge between traditional and decentralized financial ecosystems but could also unlock deeper liquidity, utility, and yield opportunities within DeFi protocols. The stablecoin market has already shown signs of this rapid growth trajectory. Data from blockchain analytics platform Glassnode reveals that the aggregate supply of the five largest stablecoins recently hit an all-time high of over $208 billion as of March 28. That figure has continued climbing and surpassed $219 billion in recent weeks, reinforcing the narrative that stablecoins are driving fresh liquidity into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Pakman views this growing stablecoin supply as a structural tailwind that could catalyze broader crypto market expansion. Furthermore, the CoinFund executive noted that stablecoins could become even more influential if regulatory developments allow for additional yield-generating features. Specifically, he mentioned that if exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US or other major markets are permitted to offer staking rewards or yield-bearing mechanisms, it could fuel a wave of DeFi activity and mainstream adoption. “If we have a moment this year where ETFs are permitted to provide staking rewards or yield to holders, that unlocks really meaningful uplift in DeFi activity, broadly defined,” Pakman said. Beyond their role as a trading instrument and store of value, stablecoins are increasingly being used for everyday payments and remittance services — a trend that supports the case for long-term growth. Pakman pointed out that stablecoin transaction volumes have skyrocketed, increasing more than 22 times since 2021. More importantly, he highlighted a noticeable decrease in the average transaction size, indicating that stablecoins are being used more frequently for smaller, everyday payments rather than just large institutional transfers. This aligns with recent observations from CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju, who has noted that stablecoins are evolving into an essential payment and remittance tool, particularly in emerging markets and regions where access to traditional banking is limited. However, Ju tempered expectations about the direct impact of stablecoin growth on Bitcoin’s price, cautioning that an expanding stablecoin supply alone may not be enough to fuel Bitcoin’s next major rally without additional catalysts. Market Mid-Cycle, Not Euphoric Peak Analysts at blockchain intelligence firm IntoTheBlock have also weighed in on the growing stablecoin supply, suggesting that the market may still be in a “mid-cycle” phase rather than at the euphoric peak of a bull market. The steady increase in stablecoin liquidity is often viewed as a leading indicator of capital readiness for broader crypto market participation. Historically, when stablecoin reserves on exchanges rise, it signals that investors have cash on the sidelines, ready to flow into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other crypto assets. With stablecoins now playing an integral role in payment processing, trading, lending, and cross-border transactions, the industry could be on the verge of a new era of digital finance — one in which blockchain-based money serves billions worldwide. Sonic Labs Cancels US Dollar-Pegged Algorithmic Stablecoin, Shifts Focus to UAE Dirham-Backed Model In related news, Sonic Labs, a leading blockchain development firm co-founded by renowned DeFi architect Andre Cronje , has abandoned its plans to launch a US dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin, pivoting instead to a new project focused on a United Arab Emirates dirham-denominated alternative. The move comes amid growing regulatory scrutiny of algorithmic stablecoins and in the wake of lessons learned from past catastrophic failures in the crypto market. The unexpected reversal was announced by Cronje on March 28 via a post on social platform X, just one week after revealing the firm's ambitious plans to launch a USD-based algorithmic stablecoin offering yields of up to 23% annually. “We will no longer be releasing a USD-based algorithmic stablecoin,” Cronje wrote. “Completely unrelated, we will be releasing a mathematically bound numerical Dirham, which is settled and denominated in USD, which is definitely not a USD-based algorithmic stablecoin.” The change in strategy coincides with the UAE’s announcement that it will roll out its digital dirham central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the fourth quarter of 2025 — a development that may have influenced Sonic Labs’ shift toward a dirham-backed solution. Sonic Labs’ original plan to launch a USD-pegged algorithmic stablecoin was met with considerable skepticism within the crypto community. Many critics cited the collapse of TerraUSD (UST) — a dollar-pegged algorithmic stablecoin that infamously lost its peg in May 2022, wiping out over $40 billion in market value — as a cautionary tale. The failure of Terra’s algorithmic model triggered widespread regulatory backlash, significant investor losses, and a loss of public confidence in such mechanisms. Cronje himself has been candid about the emotional toll the Terra collapse had on him and other developers in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. In previous statements, he admitted to experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to algorithmic stablecoins . “Pretty sure our team cracked algo stable coins today, but previous cycle gave me so much PTSD not sure if we should implement,” Cronje said at the time. The memory of Terra’s downfall, which saw UST depeg from the US dollar and crash to as low as $0.30 while sister token LUNA plummeted from over $120 to under $1, remains fresh in the minds of investors and policymakers alike. The incident became a defining moment for crypto regulation, leading the European Union to explicitly prohibit algorithmic stablecoins under its Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) bill to prevent similar collapses. Sonic Labs' pivot toward a UAE dirham-denominated stablecoin appears to align strategically with the broader digital transformation of the UAE’s financial system. Earlier this month, Khaled Mohamed Balama, governor of the Central Bank of the UAE, confirmed that the country plans to launch its blockchain-based digital dirham CBDC by the end of 2025. The digital dirham is expected to function alongside its physical counterpart and will be accepted across all payment channels. Balama emphasized that the introduction of the digital dirham could strengthen financial stability, improve cross-border payments, and aid in combating financial crimes through enhanced transparency and traceability. While Cronje stressed in his announcement that Sonic’s new project is “definitely not” an algorithmic stablecoin, the company's focus on a mathematically bound, dirham-based model suggests an attempt to create a compliant and regionally integrated digital asset that could benefit from the UAE’s progressive stance toward blockchain and financial innovation. The timing of Sonic Labs’ decision reflects a broader recalibration within the crypto industry regarding stablecoins. Recent market trends show that stablecoins are increasingly being used for small, everyday payments, as opposed to large speculative transfers. A Safer Approach to Onchain Payments? The decision to build a UAE dirham-denominated stablecoin, rather than a USD algorithmic model, may prove to be a prudent long-term strategy for Sonic Labs. By integrating their product with the financial ecosystem of a jurisdiction actively pursuing a regulated digital currency, the firm can potentially avoid the pitfalls and risks that doomed Terra and other algorithmic stablecoins. Whether Sonic Labs’ dirham-backed stablecoin will gain traction remains to be seen, but the project reflects an increasing trend toward stablecoin models that are either fully collateralized, centrally regulated, or closely tied to sovereign digital currencies — rather than relying on opaque algorithms and unsustainable yield incentives.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-31 05:30:00

Shiba Inu Price seems unlikely to recover soon, and a rival is emerging as an entirely new DeFi project with practical use cases.

SHIB recently saw its price fall by 2% over the last week to $0.00001253. According to Shiba Inu latest news, the dip was on the heels of investors moving funds around amid negative technical signals. Moving averages show a steady decline, and the relative strength index shows that SHIB is overbought. Chart patterns show no signs of a breakouts that can potentially push the price higher. The experts see SHIB continuing to hold its pace but with no promise of an upswing. Certain technical models forecast a dip by about 2.19% to $0.00001268 by April 29.

Its current DeFi coin price of $0.0734 is attractive, and most believe that it can go through the roof again once more financial institutions adopt its technology.

If you’re looking for the best crypto to invest in that combines high-risk, high-reward potential with growing market presence, Peanut the Squirrel could be your next big play. Ranked #194 with a market cap of $183.89 million, PNUT is making waves in the Solana blockchain ecosystem. While its recent 24-hour drop of 9.78% might raise some eyebrows, the long-term potential is undeniable. PNUT’s price has been volatile, with its most recent peak at $2.47 in November 2024.

With a price tag of just $0.000000064, OSAK is still far from its all-time high of $0.092303 reached in April 2023. However, the 85.39% drop from that high may signal that the coin is undervalued, making it an interesting entry point for investors looking to bet on its recovery. As a meme coin with substantial liquidity and a fully diluted valuation (FDV) of $63.52 million, Osaka Protocol presents a unique opportunity for those looking to enter the DeFi space with a meme coin twist. The circulating supply of 750.87 trillion OSAK tokens is massive, but with its focus on decentralized community collaboration, it continues to attract attention.

Busan District Court Criminal Division 6 convicted the defendants of breaching the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes. Busan crypto scammers deceived investors with false promises The three men ran an illicit crypto investment in a building in Busan in June 2019, deceiving investors by promising to “select and trade around 1,000 quality coins (virtual currencies) from around the world. They promised investors monthly returns equivalent to 30% of their initial investments. The investment scammers used a proprietary trading algorithm they claimed would yield profits by exploiting market fluctuations. There was no such algorithm, and the funds raised were diverted for personal spending. In total, they defrauded the investors of 610 million won. The court sentenced the ring leader to four and a half years in prison. The other two, who remain unnamed for legal reasons, received three and a half years, and the one for two years and six months. While delivering the verdict, the preceding judge said the defendants took advantage of the public’s interest in cryptocurrency investment opportunities to defraud and deceive innocent investors. According to the judge, that type of behavior erodes trust in the financial system and deserves harsh punishment. The case underscores South Korean authorities’ growing scrutiny of crypto-related crimes. The country has introduced stricter regulations and oversight to safeguard investors and uphold market integrity in the past few years. According to legal experts, the ruling sends a message to would-be criminals that fraud is a serious offense in the world of crypto. South Korea’s crypto boom sparks tighter fraud crackdown As per recent data submitted to Rep. Cha Gyu-geun of the Rebuilding Korea Party, South Korea’s cryptocurrency investors reached 16.29 million in February. This figure represents nearly 32% of the country’s population. The data, compiled from accounts at the country’s top five domestic virtual asset exchanges – Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit, and Gopax – shows consistent growth throughout 2024. The number of crypto investors first surpassed 14 million in March 2024. Following Donald Trump’s election as U.S. President in November, another 500,000 people entered the market, pushing the total beyond 15 million. In a recent report, 20% of South Korean public officials who submitted asset declarations reported owning cryptocurrency. Of 2,047 officials who filed declarations, 411 disclosed direct cryptocurrency holdings or investments. As virtual asset-related crime methods become more sophisticated, intelligent, and international, establishing an effective crime response system through close cooperation with relevant organizations has become necessary. Last month, the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office established a formal joint investigation unit that exclusively investigates crypto-related crimes and fraud cases. According to a report by Aju News, the department is named the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors’ Office-run Joint Investigation Unit or JIU for Virtual Asset Crimes. The unit will include 35 full-time employees with experience dealing with crypto crimes in South Korea, mainly prosecutors and financial regulators from the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service. It will be led by Chief Prosecutor Park and two deputy chief prosecutors. The body was originally formed as a temporary task force in 2023 to handle the spike in crypto-related fraud cases. However, as the number of cases has only increased significantly in South Korea in the past two years, alongside the rise of crypto adoption in the country, the District Prosecutors’ Office decided to transform the task force into a formal joint investigation department.

This happened as the Japanese stock market tanked 4% in early trading hours on Monday, as they prepare for President Trump’s “Liberation Day” on April 2. Metaplanet Issues 2 Billion JPY In Zero-Interest Bonds for Bitcoin Purchase Earlier today, Metaplanet announced the issuance of its 10th Series of Ordinary Bonds worth 2 Billion JPY to the EVO FUND. The officials stated that they would use these funds exclusively to fund Bitcoin purchases . The zero-interest bonds, each with a face value of ¥50 million, are scheduled for redemption on September 30, 2025. Simon Gerovich, Representative Director of Metaplanet, oversaw the bond issuance. In a message on the X platform, Gerovich wrote: “Buying the dip!” Apart from the Japanese firm, Bitcoin miner Marathon Digital has also announced a $2 billion stock sale to fund its Bitcoin purchases ahead. In less than a year of adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, the Japanese firm has already accumulated 3,350 BTC at an average purchase price of $83,000 per BTC. To execute its BTC purchase plan moving ahead, the firm has also tapped Eric Trump to join its board of advisers. Despite the current development, the stock price has come under severe selling pressure, dropping by 23% over the past week after a strong rally in early March. Trump Liberation Day Pushes Japanese Stock Market Down 4% As the global markets prepare for the Trump “Liberation Day” set to kick in on April 2nd, Japan’s stock market has dropped more than 4% in the early trading hours on Monday. Bitcoin price sees continued selling pressure, slipping under $81,500 as markets brace for greater macro uncertainty this week. This overall development has led to further selling pressure on the Metaplanet stock in recent days. Global market is bracing for major turbulence ahead as risk-ON assets face strong selling pressure as Trump’s reciprocal tariffs kick in. President Trump has declared Wednesday as “Liberation Day,” marking the start of a wave of new tariffs. The U.S. is set to impose 20%+ tariffs on imports from over 25 countries, targeting goods valued at more than $1.5 trillion by the end of April. Amid this massive uncertainty, the Gold price is eying a solid $3,100 levels. Policy Uncertainty Surges to Historic Highs The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index has soared to unprecedented levels, surpassing nearly every major crisis in modern U.S. history. Current uncertainty levels are approximately 80% higher than those recorded during the 2008 financial crisis.

Currently, only Tesla and Block hold Bitcoin among S&P 500 firms, but projections suggest over 120 more could follow. While the US sees increasing corporate and institutional Bitcoin adoption, Europe still lags behind due to regulatory complexity and conservative financial strategies. Meanwhile, institutional interest in decentralized finance (DeFi) is also limited, thanks to privacy concerns, regulatory uncertainty, and compliance risks. S&P 500 Companies May Turn to Bitcoin A growing belief is emerging among financial experts that a large portion of the S&P 500 could adopt Bitcoin as part of their corporate treasuries by the end of the decade. Elliot Chun, a partner at tech-focused advisory firm Architect Partners, predicted that by 2030, around 25% of S&P 500 companies will hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Chun believes this shift will be driven by increasing pressure on treasury managers, who may fear job security risks if they fail to capitalize on Bitcoin's potential upside. He suggested that managers will feel obliged to at least experiment with Bitcoin as they know that the risk of inaction could outweigh the risk of failure. Currently, only two S&P 500-listed firms, Tesla and Block, hold Bitcoin. If Chun’s projection materializes, at least another 123 S&P 500 firms will need to follow suit. For now, 89 publicly traded firms globally hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets, with Strategy (MSTR) leading the way as the largest corporate holder. GameStop may soon join the list after its recent $1.3 billion convertible notes offering, which is intended to fund Bitcoin purchases. Entities holding BTC (Source: Bitcoin Treasuries ) The enthusiasm around Bitcoin's long-term prospects is also fueled by well known tech investors and executives. People like ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, and Block CEO Jack Dorsey predicted that Bitcoin could climb to the $500,000 to $1,000,000 range by 2030. Historically, companies that incorporated Bitcoin into their treasuries have benefited. In fact, Strategy's stock surged by more than 2,000% since it first invested in Bitcoin in August of 2020. This far outpaced Bitcoin’s own 781% growth and the S&P 500’s 64.8% gain during the same period. However, Chun also warned that not every firm will be able to replicate Strategy’s success. He pointed out that the firm became a “one-of-one” by repositioning itself entirely around Bitcoin, and this move is unlikely to work for every company. Chun pointed out that when Strategy began accumulating Bitcoin, it was one of the few ways for US asset managers to gain some exposure to the cryptocurrency. That changed in January of 2024 when the SEC approved multiple spot Bitcoin ETF applications. Despite the momentum, Chun argued that Bitcoin is still an ”unproven strategy” as a treasury asset, particularly for those seeking to hedge against inflation or diversify risk. Nevertheless, he believes in Bitcoin’s flexibility and advantages over traditional stores of value like gold. He explained that Bitcoin is a digital commodity recognized under GAAP accounting standards, with a fungible and highly liquid profile that is easier to store and transfer compared to gold. Europe Lags Behind in Bitcoin Adoption While Bitcoin adoption among US companies is expected to go up, institutional adoption of Bitcoin in the European Union remains slow. After President Donald Trump’s March 7 executive order to use Bitcoin seized in criminal cases to build a federal Bitcoin reserve, European firms have shown little movement in embracing the cryptocurrency. This hesitation is largely due to the complexity of Europe’s regulatory environment and a more conservative approach to new financial instruments. Elisenda Fabrega , general counsel at European RWA tokenization platform Brickken, noticed that corporate adoption in Europe is still limited due to structural barriers, including regulatory ambiguity, institutional caution, and market maturity. Unlike the US, where Bitcoin is being positioned as a national reserve asset, Europe still has to take a clear stance on the cryptocurrency's role in corporate treasuries or national finance strategies. Bitcoin’s economic model, which rewards early adopters, fueled the growing institutional interest in the US, especially after Trump’s executive order. However, European institutions largely refrained from disclosing large Bitcoin holdings or crypto service offerings. Only a few exceptions include BNP Paribas, 21Shares AG, VanEck Europe, Jacobi Asset Management, and Bitpanda. Even so, a recent Bitpanda survey suggests that European financial firms may be underestimating investor demand for crypto exposure by as much as 30%. (Source: Bitpanda ) Analysts at Bitfinex point to Europe’s fragmented regulatory framework as a key reason behind the slow institutional adoption. Conservative investment mandates and regulatory hurdles have made it quite difficult for European pension funds and large asset managers to confidently allocate to Bitcoin. Retail investor demand in Europe is also generally weaker compared to the US, which has benefited from a more unified capital market and clearer regulatory guidance, particularly after the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Despite the current sluggishness, some signs of potential change emerged. On March 25, BlackRock launched a Bitcoin exchange-traded product (ETP) in Europe, which could help build institutional confidence and encourage more corporate adoption of Bitcoin across the European market. DeFi Growth Stalled While Bitcoin adoption is picking up some steam, institutional adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) still faces many obstacles. This is largely due to concerns around privacy, regulatory uncertainty, and legal accountability. Shibtoshi , the founder of the privacy-focused DeFi platform SilentSwap, pointed out that the inherent transparency of on-chain transactions poses a major challenge for businesses that need to protect sensitive information like trading strategies, payroll data, and corporate agreements. He explained that while the concerns around compliance, privacy, and user experience are valid, they are also solvable. Advances in privacy-preserving protocols like SilentSwap, which aim to offer enterprise-grade privacy solutions, are helping make DeFi more appealing to corporate users. A key issue slowing institutional participation in DeFi is the lack of regulatory clarity, particularly regarding whether DeFi tokens qualify as securities and who bears legal responsibility when decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) make mistakes. Shibtoshi also believes that there is a need for sensible regulation that encourages innovation without sacrificing the core benefits of DeFi, including self-custody, speed, and low-cost transactions. In the United States, lawmakers recently took a step toward reducing regulatory burdens on DeFi by repealing the controversial IRS broker rule. This rule would have required decentralized platforms to report customer transactions. It was overturned by a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives in early March. However, there are still some concerns that continued overregulation could ultimately stifle the DeFi sector. Crypto entrepreneur Artem Tolkachev argued that the push for stringent regulatory compliance risks undermining the very principles of decentralization that define DeFi. He warned that excessive regulation could increase the potential for censorship and shift control away from users toward intermediaries and large institutions.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-31 05:54:16

As reported by Chosun Ilbo, Busan District Court’s Criminal Division 6, led by Presiding Judge Kim Yong-gyun, announced the verdict on March 30. The court sentenced the group’s leader, Mr. A, who served as the CEO of an investment company, to 4.5 years in prison. Two other members of the gang received prison sentences of 3.5 years and 2.5 years, respectively. The defendants established an investment firm in Busan in June 2019, claiming they would select and trade around 1,000 high-quality virtual currencies from across the globe. They promised investors monthly returns of 30% on their original investments. However, instead of managing the funds as promised, the group embezzled the money for personal gain. The court criticized the defendants for exploiting the victims’ lack of knowledge about cryptocurrency investments. The judge stated, “Mr. A and others committed the crime by taking advantage of the victims’ lack of knowledge about coin investment,” adding that the method and circumstances of the crime were “very poor,” as they misled investors with false promises. This case shows the growing issue of crypto-related fraud in South Korea.

The Financial Services Agency (FSA) plans to submit a bill to parliament to revise the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act as early as next year after having considered the changes through internal study groups, Nikkei reported on March 30 without citing a source. The outlet reported that the details are still being finalized, but the change would see cryptocurrencies likely put under insider trading laws that currently apply to other financial products, such as stocks, which outlaw trades based on insider information. However, cryptocurrencies are likely to be put in a separate category from securities such as stocks and bonds. If the changes go through and crypto is regulated under the country’s finance laws , companies offering crypto would have to register with the FSA. Nikkei reported that the regulator plans to enforce the new rules regardless of whether a company operates in Japan, but it was unclear how the laws would be enforced against overseas entities. Also unclear was what cryptocurrencies would be regulated and how distinctions would be made between widely traded assets such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) compared to speculative and high-risk tokens such as memecoins. The FSA’s headquarters is in central Tokyo, just across the street from the Ministry of Finance. Source: Wikimedia The reported upcoming change comes amid a wave of pro-crypto moves made by Japan’s regulators and government. Related: USDC stablecoin receives approval for use in Japan, says Circle Earlier this month, the country issued its first license allowing a company to deal with stablecoins to SBI VC Trade, a subsidiary of the local financial conglomerate SBI, which said it was preparing to support Circle’s USDC ( USDC ). The country’s ruling Liberal Democracy Party also moved ahead with reforms to slash the capital gains tax on crypto from 55% to 20% and categorize digital assets as a distinct asset class. In February, local reports said the FSA was looking to lift a ban on crypto-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to align with the policy position of Hong Kong, which approved crypto ETFs for trading in April 2024.

Data submitted to representative Cha Gyu-geun of the minor opposition Rebuilding Korea Party found over 16 million people had crypto exchange accounts out of a total population of 51.7 million, according to a March 30 report from local news agency Yonhap. This would be equivalent to over 30% of the population. All the data was taken from the top five domestic virtual exchanges in South Korea: Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, Korbit and Gopax. Individuals with multiple accounts were only counted once. Industry officials are reportedly speculating the number of crypto users could hit 20 million by the end of the year, with one unnamed official being cited by Yonhap saying: “Some believe the crypto market has reached a saturation point, but there is still an endless possibility for growth compared with the matured stock market.” Following Trump’s election win last November, the number of crypto users spiked by over 600,000 to 15.6 million , collectively holding 102.6 trillion South Korean won ($70.3 billion) in crypto assets.

This all-stock transaction, unveiled on Friday via a post on X itself, signals a significant consolidation of Musk’s empire and a powerful push towards integrated AI development. For those tracking the intersection of crypto and tech, this acquisition underscores the growing influence of AI and its potential to reshape social media and beyond. The Groundbreaking xAI Acquisition of Social Media Platform X: A Deep Dive “xAI has acquired X in an all-stock transaction,” Musk declared, setting the stage for a unified future. This isn’t just a simple merger; it’s a strategic alignment of two powerful entities under Musk’s vision. Let’s break down the key details of this landmark acquisition : All-Stock Deal: The transaction is entirely in stock, meaning no cash was exchanged directly. This suggests a long-term commitment and confidence in the combined entity’s future growth. Valuation Revelation: Musk disclosed the valuations of both companies, pegging xAI at a hefty $80 billion and X at $33 billion (after accounting for $12 billion in debt against a $45 billion enterprise value). This provides a fresh benchmark for the perceived worth of both ventures in the current market. Synergistic Future: Musk emphasized the “intertwined” futures of xAI and X, highlighting the strategic rationale behind the acquisition . He explicitly mentioned combining “data, models, compute, distribution, and talent,” indicating a deep integration across all operational layers. For those in the crypto space, where community and information dissemination are paramount, the implications of this acquisition are considerable. X, a vital social media platform for crypto discussions and news, is now intrinsically linked with a leading AI developer. This could lead to novel integrations of AI within the X platform, potentially impacting how information is shared, consumed, and even verified within the crypto community. Why Now? Decoding Musk’s Strategic Play The timing and rationale behind this acquisition are crucial to understanding Musk’s grand plan. Here are some key factors driving this decision: Data and Model Powerhouse: X’s vast trove of user-generated content is a goldmine for training advanced AI models. By bringing X under the xAI umbrella, Musk secures direct and unfettered access to this invaluable data resource, giving xAI a significant edge over competitors like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. Distribution Advantage: X provides xAI with an unparalleled distribution channel to deploy its AI products, like the Grok chatbot, directly to a massive user base. Imagine AI-powered features seamlessly integrated into your X experience – this acquisition makes that a tangible reality. Financial Efficiency: As reported by the Wall Street Journal, combining the entities is expected to streamline fundraising efforts. A unified xAI Holdings Corp. is likely to be a more attractive proposition for investors seeking exposure to both AI and a major social media platform . Competitive Edge in the AI Race: Musk is clearly positioning xAI to be a frontrunner in the fiercely competitive AI landscape. This acquisition is a bold move to consolidate resources and accelerate xAI’s progress in developing cutting-edge AI technologies. Valuation Volatility: X’s Rollercoaster Ride The valuation of X has been a subject of intense scrutiny and fluctuation since Musk’s initial purchase in 2022. Let’s trace the valuation journey: Timeline Event Valuation (USD Billion) October 2022 Musk Acquires Twitter $44 Post-Acquisition (Various Estimates) Fidelity Estimate Less than $10 Recent Months Rise in Valuation Increased (Driven by perceived influence) xAI Acquisition Musk’s Declared Valuation $33 (Net of Debt) / $45 (Enterprise Value) xAI Valuation Standalone Valuation $80 This valuation rollercoaster highlights the dynamic nature of tech company valuations, especially in the rapidly evolving social media platform and AI sectors. Musk’s initial purchase price of $44 billion now appears significantly higher than the current assessed value of X within this acquisition deal. However, the strategic value of X to xAI, particularly for data and distribution, is undeniable. xAI’s Ascent in the AI Arena: Challenging OpenAI and Beyond Founded in 2023, xAI has rapidly emerged as a serious contender in the AI race. Musk has aggressively recruited top AI talent and invested heavily in infrastructure. Key milestones in xAI’s journey include: Talent Acquisition: xAI has poached leading AI researchers from Google DeepMind, Microsoft, and OpenAI, assembling a formidable team. Infrastructure Build-out: Massive AI data centers have been constructed to support the training and deployment of advanced AI models. Fundraising Success: xAI has secured substantial funding, including a $6 billion round in December, and its valuation has soared to $80 billion, reflecting investor confidence in its potential. Grok AI Model: The development of Grok 3, a frontier AI model, demonstrates xAI’s technological prowess, rivaling industry leaders in key performance benchmarks. Musk’s simultaneous efforts to challenge OpenAI, both through lawsuits and a takeover bid, underscore his ambition to reshape the AI landscape. The acquisition of X provides xAI with a unique strategic advantage in this ongoing competition. The Road Ahead: Integration and Implications With the acquisition finalized, the focus now shifts to the integration of xAI and X. While Grok has already been integrated into X Premium, deeper integrations are expected, potentially transforming the user experience and unlocking new AI-powered functionalities. However, Musk’s history of blurring lines between his companies also raises potential regulatory and ethical questions, which will need to be carefully navigated. Ultimately, the acquisition of X by xAI is a bold and transformative move by Elon Musk. It signifies a profound commitment to integrating AI into the fabric of social media and leveraging X as a powerful engine for xAI’s growth and innovation. For the crypto and tech communities, this development warrants close attention, as it could reshape the future of online interaction and information dissemination in the age of AI.

Besides, Four (FORM) & Zcash (ZEC) display some strength but hold marginal gains between 5% and 9%. Why is the Crypto Market Down Today? The ETFs are recording consecutive outflows, which suggests the bearish sentiments of the investors. Meanwhile, the major reason for the pullback is said to be the uncertainty ahead of the new tariffs by the United States, which are set to begin on 02 April 2025. With this, experts believe a potential increase in the inflation rates that could negatively impact the market. Along with this, the EU CPI & unemployment rates and the US unemployment, non-farm payrolls, and Fed Chair Powell’s speech are scheduled for this week, which may keep up the volatility within the markets.

The Bitcoin price has dropped but does carry a strong scope of a bullish rebound. As per some reports, the long-term holders have again begun to accumulate BTC along with the whales. This sheds light on the bullish possibilities, but the external tariffs and inflation rattled the markets. The historical strong Q1 patterns were not met, stirring investors’ doubts. However, experts believe Bitcoin could hedge against chaos if conditions settle. The technicals have turned bearish at the moment, suggesting potential market corrections. Hence, after the bearish quarterly close, one can expect some relief with the beginning of the fresh quarterly trade. Meanwhile, the sluggish behavior of the bulls may hinder the progress of the rally and compel the markets to remain under bearish pressure.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|BTC|ETH|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-31 06:14:40

TenArmor flagged several suspicious transactions and pointed out that the stolen funds had been transferred to RailGun, a privacy platform that helps hide transactions. Later, security platform Decurity, revealed that the hacker took advantage of a flaw in SIR.trading’s Vault contract, specifically in a function called “uniswapV3SwapCallback.” Decurity referred to the hack as a “clever attack.” Synthetics Implemented Right @leveragesir has been hacked for $355k This is a clever attack.

The anonymous creator of SIR.trading, Xatarrer, acknowledged the attack after it happened, calling it “the worst news a protocol could receive.” They asked for community feedback on what to do next and expressed interest in rebuilding despite the loss. Since this attack may be among the first instances of hackers exploiting this new Ethereum feature in the real world, it raises questions regarding the security of transient storage. Security experts caution that unless developers build stronger safeguards into their smart contracts, similar attacks may occur.

Interestingly, XRP is among the biggest losers even though the company behind the token got some big and positive news this month. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView The middle of the graph above demonstrates a big but brief shot up to $2.6 on March 19 when Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse effectively announced the end of the lawsuit between his company and the US SEC. This was the moment the XRP army waited for over four years. However, it turned out to be a classic ‘sell-the-news’ event as the asset’s price nosedived shortly after and has failed to recapture the momentum. Even last week’s confirmation of the lawsuit closure failed to impact XRP positively. Just the opposite; the third-largest cryptocurrency has plunged below $2.1. It has lost roughly 20% of its value since the March 19 peak and is close to breaking below $2, which could spell further trouble even though everything seems to be going in Ripple’s way . The market-wide correction, which has pushed BTC to $82,000, ETH to $1,800, and SOL to $125, could be blamed for XRP’s decline. However, Ripple’s cross-border token has taken this retracement the worst from the top 20 alts, having lost 14.5% on a weekly scale, while BTC is down by 5.5%, SOL by 9%, and ETH by 11.6%. Aside from the aforementioned ‘sell-the-news’ moment , another possible reason behind XRP’s particularly painful decline could be linked to the recent activities of whales. These large market participants went on an accumulation spree after the US elections and during XRP’s surge from $0.6 to $3.4 , which happened within months. Now, though, they have switched tactics by disposing of large amounts of XRP, which could trigger even a more violent price crash.

Keeping up with the flood of new AI models can feel like trying to drink from a firehose. From tech giants like Google and OpenAI to nimble startups, everyone is racing to release the next groundbreaking AI. Industry benchmarks and technical jargon often obscure what these models actually *do* for everyday users and businesses. Forget the confusion – Bitcoin World is here to give you the inside scoop on the most advanced AI models launched since 2024. We’ll break down what each model is good for and, crucially, how you can actually use them. Consider this your continuously updated guide to navigating the AI revolution. While there are millions of AI models out there (Hugging Face alone hosts over 1.4 million!), we’ve handpicked the standouts to save you time and keep you ahead of the curve. Latest AI Models Released in 2025: A Deep Dive 2025 has already been a banner year for AI innovation. Let’s explore some of the most talked-about models: Google Gemini 2.5: Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is positioned as a powerhouse for reasoning, particularly for building web applications and sophisticated code agents. While Google touts its capabilities, it’s worth noting that early benchmarks show it underperforming Claude Sonnet 3.7 on certain coding tasks. To access Gemini 2.5, you’ll need a Gemini Advanced subscription, which comes in at $20 per month. ChatGPT-4o Image Generator: OpenAI has boosted its popular GPT-4o model with image generation capabilities, expanding beyond just text. This upgrade quickly went viral, especially for its ability to transform images into anime in the style of Studio Ghibli. However, copyright implications of this feature are something to consider. Access to GPT-4o, including image generation, requires at least a $20 per month ChatGPT Plus subscription. Stability AI’s Stable Virtual Camera: Stability AI, known for image generation, has launched Stable Virtual Camera. This innovative model can generate 3D scenes and camera angles from a single 2D image. While impressive, it currently has limitations with complex scenes involving humans or dynamic elements like moving water. For non-commercial research, it’s available on HuggingFace. Cohere’s Aya Vision: Cohere’s Aya Vision is a multimodal model claiming top-tier performance in image captioning and answering questions about photos. A key differentiator is its strength in languages beyond English, a feature Cohere emphasizes sets it apart. You can try Aya Vision for free via WhatsApp. OpenAI’s GPT 4.5 “Orion”: OpenAI’s “Orion” is their largest model to date, boasting enhanced “world knowledge” and “emotional intelligence.” Despite these claims, it hasn’t topped all benchmarks compared to newer reasoning-focused models. Orion access is tied to OpenAI’s $200-per-month plan. Claude Sonnet 3.7: Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.7 is touted as the first “hybrid” reasoning model in the industry. This means it can provide quick responses for simpler queries but also engage in deeper, more thoughtful processing when needed. Anthropic also gives users control over the model’s “thinking time.” Sonnet 3.7 is available to all Claude users, but heavier users will need the $20/month Pro plan. xAI’s Grok 3: Grok 3 is the latest flagship model from Elon Musk’s xAI. It reportedly outperforms other leading models in math, science, and coding. Access to Grok 3 requires an X Premium subscription, priced at $50 per month. Following a study suggesting Grok 2 leaned left politically, Musk has stated intentions to make Grok more “politically neutral,” though the current status of this shift is unclear. OpenAI o3-mini: OpenAI’s o3-mini is a reasoning model optimized for STEM fields, including coding, math, and science. While not OpenAI’s most powerful, its smaller size translates to significantly lower costs. It’s available for free, with subscriptions for heavy users. OpenAI Deep Research: OpenAI’s Deep Research is specifically designed for in-depth research, providing clear citations. This service is part of ChatGPT’s $200-per-month Pro subscription. OpenAI suggests it for various research needs, from science to shopping, but it’s important to remember that AI hallucinations can still occur. Mistral Le Chat: Mistral has launched app versions of Le Chat, their multimodal AI personal assistant. Mistral claims Le Chat offers faster response times than other chatbots. A paid version includes up-to-date journalism from AFP. Tests by Le Monde showed impressive performance, though with more errors than ChatGPT. OpenAI Operator: OpenAI’s Operator is conceived as a personal AI intern capable of independent actions, such as grocery shopping. It’s part of the $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro subscription. While AI agents hold great promise, they are still in early stages. A Washington Post review highlighted an instance where Operator autonomously ordered a dozen eggs for $31 using the reviewer’s credit card. Google Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental: Google Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental is their flagship model, excelling in coding and general knowledge. It boasts an exceptionally long context window of 2 million tokens, beneficial for processing large volumes of text. Access requires at least a Google One AI Premium subscription at $19.99 per month. Generative AI Models Launched in 2024: Still Relevant? While 2025 is bringing a wave of new models, some powerful AI tools from 2024 continue to be highly relevant: DeepSeek R1: This Chinese AI model made waves in Silicon Valley. DeepSeek R1 performs strongly in coding and math, and its open-source nature allows for local operation. Plus, it’s free. However, R1 incorporates Chinese government censorship and faces increasing concerns and bans due to potential data transfer to China. Gemini Deep Research: Gemini Deep Research summarizes Google search results into concise, cited documents. Useful for students and anyone needing quick research summaries, its quality doesn’t match peer-reviewed academic papers. Deep Research requires a $19.99 Google One AI Premium subscription. Meta Llama 3.3 70B: This is the latest, most advanced version of Meta’s open-source Llama AI models . Meta promotes it as their most cost-effective and efficient yet, particularly for math, general knowledge, and instruction following. It remains free and open source. OpenAI Sora: Sora is a model that creates realistic videos from text prompts. While it can generate full scenes, OpenAI acknowledges its tendency to produce “unrealistic physics.” Currently, Sora is available on paid ChatGPT plans, starting with Plus at $20 per month. Alibaba Qwen QwQ-32B-Preview: This model rivals OpenAI’s o1 on certain benchmarks, excelling in math and coding. Ironically, for a “reasoning model,” Alibaba notes it has “room for improvement in common sense reasoning.” Bitcoin World testing has confirmed it also includes Chinese government censorship. It’s free and open source. Anthropic’s Computer Use Claude: Claude’s Computer Use is designed to control your computer for tasks like coding or booking flights, a precursor to OpenAI’s Operator. However, Computer Use is still in beta. Pricing is API-based: $0.80 per million input tokens and $4 per million output tokens. xAI’s Grok 2: xAI launched Grok 2, an enhanced version of their Grok chatbot, claiming it’s “three times faster.” Free users are limited to 10 questions every two hours, while X Premium subscribers get higher limits. xAI also released Aurora, an image generator producing highly photorealistic images, sometimes including graphic content. OpenAI o1: OpenAI’s o1 family aims to provide better answers through a hidden reasoning process. OpenAI claims it excels in coding, math, and safety but also exhibits deceptive tendencies. o1 access requires a ChatGPT Plus subscription ($20/month). Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 3.5: Claude Sonnet 3.5 is touted by Anthropic as best-in-class, known for its coding prowess and favored by tech insiders. It’s free on Claude, with a $20/month Pro subscription for heavy users. It understands images but cannot generate them. OpenAI GPT 4o-mini: OpenAI’s GPT 4o-mini is their most affordable and fastest model, designed for tasks like customer service chatbots. It’s available on ChatGPT’s free tier and is better for high-volume, simpler tasks than complex ones. Cohere Command R+: Cohere’s Command R+ excels in complex retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for enterprises, meaning it’s highly effective at finding and citing specific information. (The inventor of RAG works at Cohere.) However, RAG doesn’t completely eliminate AI hallucinations. Choosing the Right AI Tools for Your Needs With such a diverse range of latest AI models available, how do you choose the right one? Consider these factors: Intended Use: What do you need the AI for? Coding? Image generation? Research? Customer service? Different models excel in different areas. Budget: Many models offer free tiers or subscriptions at various price points. Factor in the cost of access. Performance: Consider benchmarks and real-world reviews for the tasks you need to perform. Data Privacy and Security: Be aware of data handling policies, especially with models that raise censorship or data transfer concerns. Ease of Use: Some models are more user-friendly than others. Consider your technical expertise. Generative AI : Beyond the Hype Generative AI is rapidly changing how we interact with technology. These advanced AI models are not just about chatbots; they are becoming integral tools for content creation, research, automation, and much more. While the hype is real, it’s important to approach these tools with a critical eye. Hallucinations, biases, and ethical concerns are still present. However, the potential of these AI models to revolutionize industries and daily life is undeniable. Stay Updated on the AI Innovation Wave The AI models landscape is constantly evolving.

In a March 28 Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Florida-based Bitcoin miner disclosed that it’s teaming up with several major investment firms to sell shares “from time to time” under a new at-the-market offering. The company said in an accompanying prospectus that proceeds will go toward general corporate purposes, but it made it clear that buying more Bitcoin is high on the list. According to the prospectus, MARA may sell its stock through firms like Barclays, Cantor Fitzgerald, and Guggenheim Securities, with sales happening directly on Nasdaq or via negotiated transactions. The offering will give MARA the flexibility to tap into the market as needed, with no set timeline or volume commitment. As of March 30, MARA shares were trading at $11.89, down 4.6% in overnight trading following an 8.6% drop on March 28. MARA already holds over 46,000 BTC worth nearly $4 billion, and the latest move reaffirms its commitment to a “full HODL” strategy under which it plans to keep all the Bitcoin it mines and buy more to stockpile for the long haul. You might also like: MARA Holdings stock down 5% amid concerning Bitcoin production announcement This latest offering follows a $1.5 billion ATM program launched last year and a $1 billion zero-coupon convertible note sale in November, also aimed at boosting its Bitcoin holdings. MARA, second only to Strategy in corporate Bitcoin holdings, is following a similar playbook to Michael Saylor’s firm, which recently unveiled plans to raise up to $21 billion via its STRK preferred stock offering as part of its “21/21” roadmap. Plans to stack up more Bitcoin follow a profitable run for MARA. In Q4 2024, the company pulled in $214.4 million in revenue , up 37% from the previous quarter, and ended the year with a net income of $528.3 million, a 248% jump year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA surged 207% to $794.4 million, setting a new benchmark for the mining sector. Last month, MARA also wrapped up its acquisition of a wind farm in Hansford County, Texas. The site, which offers 114 megawatts of wind power and 240 MW of interconnection capacity, was acquired to power older mining rigs that would’ve otherwise been retired.

Japan might be preparing to classify cryptocurrencies as financial products in a move to target insider trading, Nikkei has learned . The country’s financial regulator, the Financial Services Agency , is said to be planning a bill to revise the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act, which could be submitted to parliament as early as 2026. As of press time, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin ( BTC ) are treated as a means of settlement under the Payment Services Act, as they were initially expected to be used mainly for payments. If reclassified, they will likely be placed in a different category from traditional securities like stocks.

If crypto gets classified as a financial product, companies pitching investments might have to register with regulators — not just exchanges — since authorities are reportedly seeing more complaints from investors who feel they were misled into buying crypto. According to the report, the FSA might enforce stricter rules regardless of a company’s location, though it remains unclear how exactly the agency is planning to enforce the new rules. Earlier in March, Japan’s Cabinet signed off on a proposal to amend the Payment Services Act, aiming to loosen regulations for stablecoins and crypto brokerages, and making it easier for crypto firms to set up a presence in Japan.

From looming tariffs to whale-sized BTC bid activity, here are five major factors that market participants need to keep on their radar. #1 US Tariffs Poised To Escalate On April 2 The global stage is bracing for what US President Donald Trump has dubbed “Liberation Day” on April 2. According to The Kobeissi Letter (@KobeissiLetter), the administration’s plan for “reciprocal tariffs” promises to be a watershed moment in ongoing international trade disputes. “President Trump has been discussing this Wednesday, April 2nd, for weeks. This is a day that he has named ‘Liberation Day’ where widespread new tariffs are coming. We believe April 2nd will be the biggest escalation of the trade war to date,” The Kobeissi Letter writes via X. These tariffs will layer on top of a slew of existing US duties that span steel, aluminum, Canadian goods, Mexican goods, and many Chinese imports. The Kobeissi Letter points out that 25% levies on auto imports and on countries purchasing Venezuelan oil will also take effect this week. With retaliatory measures from Canada, China, the EU, and Mexico in the pipeline, they warn of a “massive trade war,” intensifying uncertainty for global markets. Related Reading: Bitcoin Has Bottomed, Now The Road To $1 Million Begins, Says Arthur Hayes Beyond trade specifics, the coming days could see inflation pressure intensify due to higher consumer costs on imported goods. Citing an uptick in the Economy Policy Uncertainty Index, The Kobeissi Letter highlights: “Policy uncertainty is currently above just about any crisis in modern US history. We are seeing ~80% HIGHER uncertainty levels than 2008. As a result, market swings are widening, and we expect an extremely volatile week.” Add in President Trump’s latest threats regarding Iran—where “secondary tariffs” and potential levies on Russian oil are on the table—and there are multiple international flashpoints that may feed into market volatility. #2 Bitcoin Whale Activity In the Bitcoin arena, large-scale liquidity maneuvers remain a focal point. Keith Alan (@KAProductions), co-founder of Material Indicators, drew attention to a potential whale strategy in action—attributed to a figure he dubs “Spoofy the Whale.” “My first clue that something was up came with a sequence of micro movements that seemed to be a little different than his typical price adjustment of his massive blocks of ask liquidity. At a closer look I noticed a ladder of BTC bid liquidity perfectly aligned and moving with the ask liquidity. While I have no real way of confirming that it is the same entity using ask liquidity to herd price into their own bids, it certainly appears that Spoofy has been buying this dip and has bids laddered down to $78k,” Alan wrote on Sunday. He also noted the convergence of several news events—Sunday’s weekly close, Monday’s monthly close, and the expected tariff implementation midweek—that may catalyze further price swings. While acknowledging BTC could still go lower, he underlined the whale’s apparent commitment to accumulating at current levels: “In the grand scheme of things, none of this means BTC price can’t go lower, but it does mean that the whale that has been suppressing BTC price for the last 3 weeks is using a DCA strategy to buy this dip…and so am I.” #3 Bitcoin Bearish Flag Breakdown Technical analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) is warning traders to keep a close eye on pivotal support levels following a bearish flag breakdown: “We were tracking this bearish flag pattern all last week and as we can see we had a breakdown of that weakness. If BTC does lose the golden pocket here at $81K and follows through with that measured move target, then the $70K–$73K range … would be the ‘Measured Move’ target.” Still, Kevin posits that, given widespread negative sentiment around April 2 (“Armageddon Day” in some corners of the media), there is a possibility of a contrarian twist: “Will the Tariff implementation on April 2nd be a rare ‘sell the rumor buy the news event’? … Everyone thinks the world is suddenly going to end.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders In Extreme Panic And Fear — What This Means He also added: “A little bit of long liquidity at the $78K-$80K level but a lot of juice in the $87K-$89K (Dark Yellow) range for market makers to transact in right before the CNBC proclaimed “Armageddon Day” on April 2nd. Makes me wonder.” #4 Seasoned Players Accumulate From an on-chain perspective, Axel Adler Jr, an analyst at CryptoQuant, observes that experienced market participants are moving into a new accumulation phase. Drawing from the Value Days Destroyed (VDD) indicator, Adler identifies a series of four distinct accumulation periods since early 2023, marking the current cycle as ripe for potential long-term upside: “The absence of significant selling in the current phase demonstrates the confidence of these experienced players that the current BTC price level is not favorable for profit-taking.” Adler underlines that historical data shows low VDD periods often precede price increases, suggesting a bullish medium-term outlook—provided macro factors, including global economic policy shifts, do not derail market sentiment. #5 CME Gap Lastly, traders need to watch the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange) gap formation, which has been a notable feature in Bitcoin’s price action. Rekt Capital (@rektcapital) highlighted the recent filling of a gap between $82,000 and $85,000: “BTC has filled the general CME Gap area from $82k–$85k. Moreover, Bitcoin will probably develop a brand new CME Gap over this weekend … Which could set BTC up for a move into at least $84k next week.” CME gaps often act as magnets for price action, and Rekt Capital’s analysis suggests a possible retracement to fill newly formed gaps or a continuation move that takes BTC higher, depending on how broader market forces unfold this week. At press time, BTC traded at $82,010.

Apple is reportedly developing a groundbreaking AI coach for its Health app, poised to revolutionize how we approach our well-being. Imagine having a personalized, AI-powered health guru right in your pocket, guiding you towards a healthier lifestyle. This isn’t just another app update; it’s a leap into the future of health apps , promising a proactive and deeply customized wellness journey. Let’s dive into what this exciting development could mean for you and the future of digital health. What’s the Buzz About Apple’s AI Health Coach? According to Bloomberg’s reliable tech reporter, Mark Gurman, Apple is significantly revamping its Health app to incorporate an AI health coach . This isn’t a fleeting idea; it’s a project that has been in development for some time and is now gaining serious momentum. The expected launch timeframe? Potentially as early as spring or summer of 2026, coinciding with the anticipated release of iOS 19.4. This ambitious timeline suggests Apple is committed to making personalized, AI-driven health guidance a core feature of its ecosystem. This move could redefine how users interact with their health data and take actionable steps towards wellness. For those in the cryptocurrency world, always seeking cutting-edge tech and transformative trends, this development in AI powered health is definitely one to watch. Decoding the AI Health Coach: How Will It Work? The magic behind this AI health coach lies in its ability to synthesize data from your various medical devices. Think of it as a central intelligence hub for your health metrics. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: Data Aggregation: The AI will pull data from a range of sources – your Apple Watch, connected scales, sleep trackers, and potentially even integrated medical devices. Personalized Insights: Instead of just presenting raw data, the AI will analyze this information to provide personalized advice tailored to your specific health profile and goals. Food Tracking Integration: A crucial component reportedly includes food tracking. This suggests the AI will offer dietary recommendations and monitor your nutritional intake, a cornerstone of any effective health plan. Expert Training: To ensure accuracy and reliability, the AI is being trained using data from staff physicians. Apple is even looking to expand this by incorporating health-related videos from additional doctors, adding a layer of expert-backed guidance. Tentative Name: Health+: While subject to change, the service is currently being referred to as Health+, hinting at a premium, enhanced health experience. Imagine receiving proactive suggestions like, “Based on your sleep patterns and activity levels, consider adjusting your evening routine to improve sleep quality,” or “Your food log indicates a need for more protein in your diet; here are some healthy sources.” This level of personalized, actionable advice marks a significant step forward in proactive healthcare. The Promise of a Digital Health Revolution: Benefits of an AI Coach The introduction of an AI health coach in the Apple Health app isn’t just a feature upgrade; it signals a potential digital health revolution . Here’s why this development is so significant: Benefit Description Personalized Health Guidance Move beyond generic health tips. Receive advice tailored to your unique data, lifestyle, and health objectives. Proactive Health Management Shift from reactive healthcare (addressing issues after they arise) to proactive prevention and early intervention through AI-driven insights. Increased Engagement Interactive AI coaching can make health management more engaging and less daunting, fostering consistent healthy habits. Accessible Expert Advice Democratize access to personalized health advice, potentially bridging gaps in healthcare access and affordability. Data-Driven Wellness Make informed decisions about your health based on concrete data analysis, rather than relying on general guidelines or guesswork. For individuals keen on optimizing their well-being, particularly those engaged in fast-paced and demanding fields like cryptocurrency, having an AI powered health assistant could be invaluable for maintaining peak performance and preventing burnout. Navigating the Challenges: What to Consider? While the prospect of an AI health coach is exciting, it’s important to acknowledge potential challenges and considerations: Data Privacy and Security: Entrusting sensitive health data to an AI system raises critical questions about privacy and security. Robust data protection measures are paramount. Accuracy and Reliability of AI Advice: The effectiveness of the AI coach hinges on the accuracy of its algorithms and the quality of its training data. Continuous validation and refinement will be crucial. User Adoption and Trust: Building user trust in AI-driven health advice is essential. Transparency in how the AI works and clear communication about its limitations will be key to widespread adoption. Integration Complexity: Seamless integration across various devices and health platforms will be vital for a user-friendly and effective experience. The Human Element: While AI can provide valuable insights, the human element of healthcare – empathy, nuanced understanding, and complex decision-making – remains irreplaceable. The AI coach should be seen as a powerful tool to augment, not replace, human healthcare professionals. Addressing these challenges proactively will be crucial to ensure that the future of health apps , powered by AI, is both beneficial and responsible. Is This the Future of Personal Wellness? Apple’s foray into AI-driven health coaching strongly suggests a significant shift towards personalized and proactive wellness management. The potential for an AI health coach to empower individuals to take control of their health is immense. By leveraging the power of artificial intelligence, Apple is positioning itself at the forefront of the digital health revolution , aiming to make sophisticated health guidance accessible to millions. As we eagerly anticipate the arrival of iOS 19.4 and the potential launch of Health+, it’s clear that the convergence of AI and personal health is poised to transform how we live healthier, more informed lives.

The block data shows Uniswap plunged from 99 to 364 in ranking within two months. Source – The Block The substantial shift came after the protocol soared to new heights following Donald Trump’s presidential victory. The key development has grabbed investor attention, with many speculating about the native coin UNI and its short-term price actions. Uniswap loses momentum after Trump-fueled growth Uniswap displayed resilience throughout last year, ranking in the 190s. However, magnified bullishness after the US election results propelled the platform to the 110s. Cryptocurrencies rallied to record highs after Trump’s win due to the president’s pro-crypto attitude. The optimism overflowed into 2025, with Trump’s inauguration pushing Uniswap to rank 99 in January. The connection between Uniswap’s rising popularity and political developments confirms that enthusiasts expected a favorable environment for crypto business under the Trump administration. Uniswap’s swift growth reflected similar trends in the digital assets market. Cryptocurrencies flew to record peaks after Donald Trump’s inauguration, with Bitcoin holding above $100K . The swift shifts in Uniswap rankings Nevertheless, the market failed to keep the momentum. Uniswap has gradually dropped in finance app rankings since January, even hitting lows not seen during its 2023 struggles. Fading election-fueled optimism and a broad market correction catalyzed the significant plunge. In addition, intensifying DEX competition, with PancakeSwap dominating , dented Uniswap’s market position. While still a key player within the DeFi world, Uniswap’s declining app store ranking reflects the hurdles cryptocurrency platforms face after hype-driven surges. Speculative interest, not solid adoption, fueled Uniswap’s growth, explaining the recent sharp plummets. Also, the crypto market has slumped after the US election wave. Sustained bearish pressure in recent months has pushed Bitcoin down to around $82,000 at press time. The significant dips and market instability often affect DEXs as participants change their approaches according to broad-based trends. UNI price outlook The token trades at $5.90 following a 1.75% dip in the past 24 hours. Chart by Coinmarketcap UNI demonstrated robust bearishness after losing 13% and 22% in the past week and month, respectively. Crypto trader TA highlighted Uniswap’s weakness. The chart shows a sharp decline from UNI’s previous peak at around $18.98. The nearly 70% price crash has triggered debates about whether the alt will hit new lows soon. The steep drop matches the declines in app store rankings, confirming persistent Uniswap downtrends. The altcoin lacks a reliable support barrier until $5.51 – 6.6% away from UNI’s current price.

According to data from SoSoValue, the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $196.48 million in net inflows over the past week, a drop of 73.6% from the week prior, which saw $744.35 million enter the funds. Notably, Bitcoin ETFs recorded net positive flows in the first four days of the week of March 24–28, starting with $84.17 million on Monday, followed by $26.83 million, $89.57 million, and $89.06 million. However, these investment products saw a shift in investor sentiment, ending the week with a net outflow of $93.16 million on Friday. The majority of inflows were captured by BlackRock’s IBIT, which drew in $172 million, followed by Fidelity’s FBTC with $86.8 million per Faside data . Modest positive momentum also came from VanEck’s HODL, which saw $5 million in net inflows. However, it wasn’t entirely a bullish week across the board, as ARK 21Shares’ ARKB, Bitwise’s BITB, WisdomTree’s BTCW and Invesco’s BTCO still saw combined outflows of $67.4 million. The remaining BTC ETFs remained flat over the five days. You might also like: Bitcoin, altcoins at risk as Nasdaq 100, S&P 500 hit death crosses Notably, the outflows seen on Friday, March 28, ended a 10-day streak of inflows , which also marked the longest inflow run of the year, bringing in nearly $1.07 billion into the funds. Analysts described the figure as relatively modest, noting that while there is demand for Bitcoin, investors are not showing an aggressive risk appetite. Meanwhile, the sharp shift in investor mood on Friday came as Bitcoin’s quarterly performance is turning out to be its worst since 2018, when it crashed by 49.7%. So far this quarter, Bitcoin is down 11.86% at $81,939, which is even worse than the 10.83% drop in Q1 2020. If prices bounce back a bit, the loss might end up being smaller than in 2020, but if the selling pressure continues, Bitcoin could dip below the $80,000 mark. The recent sell-off erased almost all of Bitcoin’s weekly gains as investors remained cautious ahead of President Trump’s U.S. reciprocal tariffs set to take effect on April 2. Additionally, stronger-than-expected core PCE data have raised concerns about a potential delay in Federal Reserve rate cuts, adding to market uncertainty.

In a new interview on The Your Life! Your Terms! YouTube channel, Alden says she’s keeping a close watch on Bitcoin’s market value to realized value (MVRV) metric, an on-chain indicator that helps assess whether BTC is overvalued or undervalued by comparing its market cap (market value) to the average price at which all coins were last moved (realized value). The macro guru explains that during the initial stages of a bull market, Bitcoin’s market cap tends to soar, while its average cost basis lags as early investors hold on to their coins in anticipation of more rallies, resulting in a higher MVRV value. Alden says that when the MVRV soars to extreme levels, it drives more long-term investors to unload their holdings, which can signal the start of a multi-year bear market. For now, the macro expert says the metric is still within its usual bull market range, leading her to believe that BTC can still soar to greater heights. “When you see more and more coins at those higher price levels, it helps lower that ratio because basically the average cost basis is catching up to some extent with that wild explosion in market cap. So what I generally point out is that we’ve not really seen extremes yet this year. Back in March 2024, when we broke out to new all-time highs for the first time in a couple of years, Bitcoin hit $73,000. That metric got a little bit euphoric, but nothing like a multi-year top historically has been. And so we saw a seven-month consolidation, but nothing really worse than that. Similarly, when Bitcoin hit $108,000 more recently, that metric got a little bit overdone, but again, it wasn’t those multi-year dislocations that we normally see. For me, I’m more on the lookout for probabilities of breaking out versus breaking down. And so my view is that there’s still a higher probability of breaking up and to say that, I don’t think we’re set for a multi-year bear market until we probably reach higher prices.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $81,357.

Perplexity, the AI search engine making waves, recently found itself at the center of such speculation. Concerns arose about the company’s financial health, fueled by user observations and online theories. But fear not, crypto and tech enthusiasts! Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has stepped forward to set the record straight, directly addressing these concerns and outlining the exciting path ahead for the AI startup . Addressing Financial Issue Speculation: What Did the Perplexity CEO Say? Recent online discussions, particularly on platforms like Reddit, suggested that Perplexity was facing significant financial issues . Users pointed to changes in product features, like the ‘Auto mode’, as potential cost-cutting measures, sparking worries about the company’s stability. One user theory even went as far as to claim Perplexity was “doing horribly financially.” However, Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas took a proactive approach to dispel these rumors. In a direct response on Reddit, Srinivas addressed user complaints and firmly reassured the community about Perplexity’s financial standing. He clarified that the introduction of ‘Auto mode’ wasn’t a cost-cutting tactic but a strategic move to enhance user experience. According to Srinivas, the goal was to simplify the user interface and reduce the overwhelming number of options and menus that are becoming common in many AI products today. He emphasized that the intention was to make the product more user-friendly, stating, “The user shouldn’t have to learn so much to use a product.” No Imminent IPO: Perplexity’s Long-Term Vision Beyond addressing immediate financial concerns, Aravind Srinivas also tackled questions about a potential Initial Public Offering ( IPO ). In the current economic climate, the prospect of tech companies going public is a hot topic, and Perplexity is no exception, given its rapid growth and innovative approach to AI search. Srinivas definitively stated, “We have all the funding we’ve raised, and our revenue is only growing.” This statement directly counters any notion of immediate financial pressure forcing the company’s hand. Furthermore, he clearly communicated Perplexity’s long-term strategy regarding public offering, asserting, “[We have] no plans of IPOing before 2028.” This timeline provides Perplexity with significant runway to further develop its technology, expand its market presence, and solidify its position in the competitive AI startup landscape. It signals a focus on sustainable growth and innovation rather than rushing into the public markets. Key Takeaways from Perplexity CEO’s Statement Let’s break down the key points from Aravind Srinivas’s reassuring message: Financial Stability Confirmed: Perplexity is not facing financial difficulties. Revenue is growing, and existing funding is sufficient. ‘Auto Mode’ is User-Centric: The feature is designed to improve user experience by simplifying the interface, not to cut costs. IPO on Hold: No plans for an IPO before 2028, indicating a long-term focus on growth and development as a private company. Focus on Innovation: Perplexity is committed to continuous product improvement and user-friendliness in the evolving AI space. What Does This Mean for the Future of Perplexity and AI Search? The CEO’s candid response provides valuable insights into Perplexity’s current state and future direction. By directly addressing rumors and outlining a clear path forward, Srinivas has instilled confidence in users, investors, and the broader tech community. For those in the cryptocurrency space, which is increasingly intertwined with AI technologies, Perplexity’s commitment to innovation and sustainable growth is a positive sign. Perplexity’s approach to AI search, prioritizing user experience and simplifying complex technology, could be a game-changer in how we interact with information online. Their focus on remaining private for the foreseeable future allows them to prioritize long-term strategic goals over short-term market pressures. This could lead to more groundbreaking innovations and a stronger, more user-focused AI search engine in the years to come.

While emphasizing that India is already at an advanced stage in CBDC development, they mentioned their advisory role in helping other countries transition to digital currencies. WOW!

The potential use of XRP within private ledgers by Indian banks could indicate a move toward enhanced efficiency in cross-border and domestic settlements. Private ledgers built on XRP technology are designed to provide scalability and cost-effective transactions for financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple has previously engaged with central banks and financial institutions worldwide to facilitate CBDC development and streamline payment systems. The mention of XRP in the fintech event suggests that Indian banks may be evaluating its use in their financial ecosystem. However, there has been no official confirmation from Indian regulators or banks regarding large-scale adoption. India’s Role in BRICS and Financial Innovation India’s involvement in BRICS, alongside Brazil, Russia, China, and South Africa, is crucial to its financial and geopolitical strategy. BRICS nations have explored alternative payment mechanisms to reduce dependence on traditional global financial systems. If Indian banks proceed with private ledger integration using XRP, it could align with broader BRICS efforts to enhance economic independence and improve settlement frameworks. The Indian government and financial sector have been cautious in their approach to digital assets while simultaneously advancing CBDC initiatives. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been conducting trials for its digital rupee, and any collaboration involving XRP technology would likely be positioned within a regulated framework. Amelie’s statement about Indian banks testing XRP private ledgers reflects ongoing blockchain experimentation in the banking sector. While the extent of these trials remains unclear, the discussion at the fintech festival indicates active engagement with blockchain-based financial solutions. The relationship between XRP technology and India’s economic infrastructure could develop further, depending on regulatory decisions and institutional adoption.

The altcoins have taken this beating even worse, with many posting double-digit price declines on a weekly scale, pushing the total market cap south to $2.750 billion. BTC Keeps Plunging A lot can change in the cryptocurrency markets within the span of a week, and this narrative proved right once again in the past seven days. Recall that bitcoin shot up to $88,800 last Monday, which became its highest price tag in over two weeks. Although it faced rejection there, it remained above $86,000 for the next several days. Tha was until Friday when the $86,000 support gave in and BTC started losing value gradually. The weekly culmination came during the weekend when bitcoin slipped to $81,600. Although it bounced off initially and went above $83,000 on Sunday, the bears regained control on Monday morning with another leg down. This time, BTC went even further south to $81,300 (on Bitstamp), which became a new two-week low. As of now, BTC struggles to remain above $82,000, trading seven grand lower than this time last week. Its market capitalization has plunged to $1.630 trillion on CG, but its dominance over the altcoins is up to 59.2%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Altcoins on a Downfall The growing BTC dominance in times of market retracement means only one thing – alts have it worse. The biggest losers from the larger caps are SUI, HBAR, LEO, and XRP , with price declines of up to 8%. DOGE, ADA, BNB, LINK, and XLM are also in the red on a daily scale, but in a less painful manner. However, the weekly chart is a lot more violent. ETH, XRP, ADA, LINK, AVAX, HBAR, and LTC have all plunged by double-digits. In contrast, CRO has gained 20% while TON is up by 6%.

The winds of economic uncertainty are picking up speed, and this time, it’s not just about market corrections or regulatory crackdowns. Whispers from Washington suggest a policy shift that could send shockwaves across global markets, potentially impacting everything from your favorite altcoins to the broader financial landscape. We’re talking about global tariffs – and not just a little tweak, but a potentially massive 20% import tax proposed by advisors to the Trump administration. Let’s dive deep into what this could mean for the world and, more importantly, for your crypto portfolio. What Exactly Are Global Tariffs and Why Should Crypto Holders Care? In simple terms, global tariffs are taxes imposed on goods imported from other countries. Think of it as a surcharge added to the price of everything from smartphones to steel, making imported products more expensive. While tariffs are sometimes used strategically, the scale being discussed here – a blanket 20% on goods from almost all nations – is unprecedented in recent history. Why should you, as someone invested in cryptocurrencies, be concerned? Because international trade and the global economy are intricately linked. A significant disruption in trade flows, like that potentially triggered by widespread tariffs, can have cascading effects: Market Volatility: Uncertainty breeds volatility. Stock markets could react negatively, and as we’ve seen, traditional market jitters often spill over into the crypto space. Inflationary Pressures: Higher import costs can translate to increased prices for consumers, leading to inflation. While some see Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, the immediate impact of broad inflation can be complex. Economic Slowdown: A trade war sparked by these tariffs could stifle global economic growth, impacting investment sentiment across all asset classes, including crypto. Geopolitical Instability: Retaliatory tariffs from other nations are highly likely, escalating trade tensions and potentially leading to broader geopolitical instability, which can further fuel market uncertainty. In essence, while cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized, global stage, they are not immune to the ripples caused by macroeconomic shifts and policy decisions in major economies like the United States. The Trump Administration’s 20% Import Tax: A Closer Look According to reports citing the Wall Street Journal, advisors within the Trump administration are seriously considering imposing an import tax of up to 20% on goods from nearly every country. This isn’t a targeted tariff on specific goods or nations; it’s a broad-stroke approach that aims to reshape global trade dynamics. Here’s a breakdown of what we know: Scope: Potentially applies to goods from almost all nations, excluding perhaps a very select few. Magnitude: Up to 20%, a significant increase compared to typical tariffs. Rationale (Speculated): Likely aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing, reducing trade deficits, and potentially as a tool for political leverage in international negotiations. Retaliation Risk: The proposal explicitly mentions considering “retaliatory tariffs,” suggesting an awareness that other countries will likely respond in kind. This proposal is still in the consideration phase, but the fact that it’s being discussed at high levels within the administration is enough to raise eyebrows and trigger market speculation. The sheer scale of a 20% import tax is what makes this particularly noteworthy and potentially disruptive. Potential Benefits and the “America First” Argument Proponents of such tariffs, often aligned with an “America First” approach, argue that they can bring several benefits: Boosting Domestic Industries: By making imports more expensive, domestically produced goods become more competitive, potentially leading to a resurgence in American manufacturing. Reducing Trade Deficits: Tariffs could decrease imports, theoretically narrowing the trade deficit. Increased Government Revenue: Tariff revenue could provide the government with additional funds. However, these perceived benefits often come with significant drawbacks, and the economic consensus leans heavily against broad-based tariffs as an effective long-term strategy. Challenges and the Looming Threat of a Trade War The potential downsides of implementing Trump tariffs of this magnitude are considerable: Challenge Impact Increased Consumer Prices Tariffs are ultimately paid by consumers through higher prices for goods and services. This can erode purchasing power and lead to inflation. Retaliatory Tariffs and Trade Wars Other countries are highly likely to retaliate with their own tariffs on US exports, leading to a trade war where everyone loses. This can severely disrupt global supply chains and economic growth. Damage to International Relations Unilateral tariffs can strain diplomatic relationships and undermine international trade agreements. Negative Impact on Export-Oriented Industries Retaliatory tariffs will hurt US export industries, offsetting any potential gains for domestic manufacturers focused on the local market. Supply Chain Disruptions Global supply chains are complex and interconnected. Tariffs can disrupt these chains, leading to inefficiencies and higher costs for businesses. The prospect of a full-blown trade war is a significant concern. History is replete with examples of trade wars leading to economic downturns and heightened international tensions. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in the 1930s, for instance, is widely blamed for exacerbating the Great Depression. Examples from History: Learning from Past Tariff Policies Looking back at historical examples of tariffs can provide valuable context: The Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act (1930): As mentioned, this US tariff hike is widely considered a major policy blunder that deepened the Great Depression. It triggered retaliatory tariffs and a sharp contraction in global trade. Trump Administration Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum (2018): While narrower in scope than the current proposal, these tariffs led to retaliatory measures from trading partners and had mixed economic effects. Some domestic industries benefited, but others faced higher input costs. US-China Trade War (2018-2020): This protracted trade dispute involved tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods traded between the US and China. It resulted in economic disruptions for both countries and globally. These examples highlight the potential for tariffs to backfire and cause unintended negative consequences. A 20% global tariff would be on a scale far exceeding recent examples, making the potential risks even greater. Actionable Insights: Navigating the Uncertainty in the Crypto Market So, what can crypto investors do amidst this uncertainty? Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on news and developments related to trade policy and global economics. Reliable financial news sources and crypto market analysis platforms are crucial. Diversify Your Portfolio: Diversification is always a good strategy, especially during times of uncertainty. Consider spreading your investments across different asset classes and cryptocurrencies. Risk Management: Reassess your risk tolerance and adjust your portfolio accordingly. Consider using stop-loss orders and other risk management tools to protect your capital. Consider Stablecoins: In periods of high volatility, stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies can offer a temporary safe haven within the crypto ecosystem. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that market volatility is a normal part of the crypto cycle. Focus on the long-term fundamentals of your chosen projects and avoid making rash decisions based on short-term market fluctuations. It’s crucial to remember that this is still a developing situation. The proposed global tariffs may not be implemented in their current form, or at all. However, the fact that they are under consideration warrants attention and careful planning. Conclusion: Bracing for Potential Economic Tremors The prospect of a 20% global tariff imposed by the Trump administration is a significant development with potentially far-reaching consequences for the global economy and, by extension, the cryptocurrency market. While the stated aims might be to bolster domestic industries and reduce trade deficits, the risks of triggering a global trade war, increasing inflation, and disrupting supply chains are substantial. For crypto investors, navigating this uncertainty requires vigilance, diversification, and a focus on risk management. The coming weeks and months will be crucial in determining the future trajectory of global trade policy and its impact on the digital asset landscape. Stay informed, stay prepared, and remember that in the world of crypto, volatility is often accompanied by opportunity.

Ethereum, currently trading around $1,911, remains the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem. Polygon (POL), priced at $0.22, continues to thrive as a top Layer-2 scaling solution, attracting major partnerships and developers. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is riding strong bullish momentum, positioning itself as top performers for explosive growth in the coming months. The project is in phase 4 of its presale priced at $0.025. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $5.8 million with over 7500 investors already onboard. In phase 5 the price will jump 20% to $0.03. MUTM could be the next big winner for those who seek greater gains and long term investment. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. This two-pronged approach maximizes security, efficiency, and decentralization and positions Mutuum Finance at the forefront of the DeFi universe. By giving users full control over their lending decisions, the platform is appealing to conservative and high-yield investors, and facilitates a more open and flexible financial system. Mutuum Finance establishes its security foundation through the launch of an entirely collateralized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The over-collateralization requirement in this model eliminates volatility risks that break algorithmic stablecoins due to their instability. The platform establishes investor confidence by employing multiple auditing activities on smart contracts together with financially transparent systems to repair DeFi lending platform vulnerabilities. Mutuum Finance emphasizes sustainability and security thus establishing itself as an excellent option for investors making long-term decisions. Exclusive Rewards and Community Incentives The initial supporters of Mutuum Finance can benefit from multiple enticing rewards which offer both generous giveaways of $100,000 awarded through $10,000 MUTM token distributions to ten winners alongside a referral program that rewards its users for new investor acquisitions. The referral system of Mutuum Finance motivates users to recruit new investors while providing rewards to these referrals. Users who join early receive privileged access to future staking pools and they obtain governance privileges while receiving first access to platform upgrade updates. The incentives provided by Mutuum Finance motivate users to join initially while developing better long-term retention of token holders. A Strategic Vision for Sustainable Growth Mutuum Finance created its tokenomics framework to promote sustainable value through proper management of liquidity and strategic partnerships and security features with anti-inflation measures. The basis for enduring token price appreciation comes from a controlled distribution process during the presale phase alongside proper management techniques. The payout system for token staking pumps out steady passive revenue which retains both investors’ commitment and protects token sustainability levels. The deflationary mechanisms function over time to reduce network supply which leads to increased scarcity thereby strengthening price growth potential for the long term. Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (POL), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are emerging as top picks for the next crypto bull cycle. While ETH and POL continue to dominate DeFi and Layer-2 scaling, MUTM is gaining traction with its hybrid DeFi lending model. Currently in Phase 4 of its presale at $0.025, MUTM has already raised $5.8 million from 7,500+ investors. The price is set to increase 20% in Phase 5, with a launch target of $0.06. With strong fundamentals and long-term growth potential, this could be a golden opportunity for investors before the next market surge.

42685970,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144615,1743406215,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Visionary Forecast: 25% of S&P 500 Companies Predicted to Embrace Bitcoin by 2030,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sp500-companies-bitcoin-adoption/,"Is Bitcoin poised to become a mainstay in corporate America’s financial strategy? A new report suggests a potentially seismic shift in how major companies manage their treasuries. Elliot Chun, a partner at crypto advisory firm Architect Partners, has made a visionary prediction: by 2030, a quarter of the S&P 500 companies will be holding Bitcoin (BTC) on their balance sheets as a long-term asset. This isn’t just a casual forecast; it’s a data-backed assertion that could reshape the financial landscape. Let’s dive into the details of this intriguing prediction and explore what it could mean for the future of corporate treasury and Bitcoin adoption . Why Bet on Bitcoin? The Rationale Behind the Prediction Chun’s prediction isn’t based on a whim. He grounds his analysis in compelling performance data, comparing the growth of the S&P 500 against Bitcoin and MicroStrategy (MSTR), a company famously known for its significant Bitcoin holdings. The data spans from August 20, 2020, to March 28, 2025, revealing some striking contrasts: S&P 500 Increase: 64.81% Bitcoin (BTC) Rise: A staggering 781.13% MicroStrategy (MSTR) Gain: An astounding 2,074.85% These figures paint a clear picture. While the S&P 500 delivered solid growth, Bitcoin and especially Bitcoin-centric investments like MicroStrategy significantly outperformed it during this period. Chun argues that this performance differential cannot be ignored by corporate treasury managers. He suggests that failing to consider Bitcoin as a potential investment, without a robust justification, could be seen as a risky stance in itself. The implication is clear: institutional investment in Bitcoin isn’t just a trend; it’s potentially a necessary evolution in corporate finance. The Current Landscape: How Many Companies Already Hold Bitcoin? While the 25% figure might seem ambitious, it’s important to understand that Bitcoin adoption by public companies is already underway. As of March 30, data from Bitcoin Treasuries indicates that a substantial 665,621 public companies are already holding BTC. This number, while including smaller entities, signals a growing acceptance of Bitcoin within the corporate world. The question isn’t whether companies are interested in Bitcoin, but rather, how quickly and widely this interest will translate into significant balance sheet allocations, especially among the giants of the S&P 500. Institutional Investment in Bitcoin: What’s Driving the Trend? Several factors are likely fueling the increasing interest in crypto investment among institutions and corporations: Diversification: Bitcoin’s low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds makes it an attractive diversification tool. In a portfolio, it can potentially reduce overall risk and enhance returns. Inflation Hedge: With concerns about inflation rising globally, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against inflationary pressures. Its limited supply of 21 million coins contrasts with fiat currencies, which can be inflated by central banks. Potential for Higher Returns: As highlighted by the data, Bitcoin has demonstrated the potential for significantly higher returns compared to traditional assets. For companies seeking to optimize their treasury reserves, this potential is hard to overlook. Technological Innovation: Embracing Bitcoin can be seen as a forward-thinking move, signaling a company’s willingness to adopt innovative technologies and stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving financial world. These factors, combined with the increasing maturity of the cryptocurrency market and the development of institutional-grade custody solutions, are making it easier and more appealing for S&P 500 companies to consider Bitcoin as a legitimate treasury asset. Challenges and Considerations for S&P 500 Companies Embracing Bitcoin While the potential benefits are compelling, Bitcoin adoption for S&P 500 companies is not without its challenges. These corporations must navigate a complex landscape of regulatory, accounting, and operational considerations: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility remains a concern. While its long-term growth potential is significant, short-term price swings can be substantial and require careful risk management. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving globally. S&P 500 companies operate under strict regulatory scrutiny, and navigating the uncertainties surrounding crypto regulations requires careful legal and compliance considerations. Accounting Standards: Current accounting standards for digital assets are not fully standardized, which can create complexities in financial reporting and auditing. Security and Custody: Ensuring the secure storage and custody of Bitcoin holdings is paramount. S&P 500 companies need robust, institutional-grade custody solutions to mitigate the risk of theft or loss. ESG Concerns: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors are increasingly important for S&P 500 companies . Bitcoin’s energy consumption has raised environmental concerns, although efforts are underway to promote more sustainable mining practices. Addressing these challenges is crucial for S&P 500 companies considering crypto investment . However, the development of clearer regulations, improved accounting standards, and more sustainable Bitcoin practices is gradually mitigating these concerns. MicroStrategy: A Pioneer in Corporate Treasury Bitcoin Strategy No discussion about corporate treasury and Bitcoin is complete without mentioning MicroStrategy. As Chun’s data highlights, MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR) has seen explosive growth, significantly outperforming both Bitcoin and the S&P 500. This performance is largely attributed to the company’s bold strategy of adopting Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. MicroStrategy’s journey serves as a real-world case study, demonstrating the potential upside – and the inherent risks – of such a strategy. While not every S&P 500 company may follow MicroStrategy’s aggressive approach, its experience provides valuable lessons and insights for those exploring Bitcoin adoption . Is Bitcoin Right for Your Company? Actionable Insights for Treasury Managers For treasury managers at S&P 500 companies (and beyond), the question isn’t whether to ignore Bitcoin entirely, but rather, how to approach it strategically. Here are some actionable insights: Due Diligence is Key: Thoroughly research and understand Bitcoin, its underlying technology, and its market dynamics. Don’t rely solely on hype; conduct independent analysis and seek expert advice.

The Future is Decentralized: Will Chun’s Prediction Hold True? Elliot Chun’s prediction that 25% of S&P 500 companies will hold Bitcoin by 2030 is undoubtedly ambitious, but it’s grounded in observable trends and compelling data. The increasing institutional investment in Bitcoin, the growing recognition of its potential as a diversification tool and inflation hedge, and the pioneering examples of companies like MicroStrategy all point towards a future where Bitcoin plays a more significant role in corporate treasury . While challenges remain, the momentum is building.

The analyst’s bullish forecast comes at a time when bearish headwinds are causing a downturn across the broader crypto market as XRP struggles to sustain levels above the crucial support of $2. Crypto Investor Shares Brave XRP Price Prediction Crypto investor Random Crypto Pal has shared a bold XRP price prediction and likened the 2017 XRP price rally to the 2025 price movement. He noted that in 2017, Ripple climbed from $0.003 to $3.31, which was an over 110,000% price gain, If it repeats this pattern, XRP could reach $3,000 . Pal’s bullish prediction has attracted criticism from other crypto investors . In response to his X post, one user noted that in 2017, XRP only needed billions of dollars to achieve the $3.31 price within months. However, for an upswing to $3,000, Ripple needed trillions of dollars in buying demand, which was not feasible. More importantly, at a price of $3,000 and a circulating supply of $58 billion, XRP would have a $174 trillion market cap. This is more than six times higher than the annual US GDP. It would also be three times bigger than the entire US stock market, which has a market cap of $69 trillion. This massive market cap valuation shows why a $3,000 XRP price prediction is hilarious. Ripple is unlikely to reach this level with the current amount of token supply. Ripple Technical Analysis As Another Crash Looms XRP price today trades at $2.09 with a 3.6% decline in 24 hours. Ripple is on the verge of another crash and might drop below $2 as investors flee from risk assets amid fears of President Trump’s tariffs and reduced odds that the Federal Reserve will trim interest rates. On the one-day price chart, XRP had formed a rounding top pattern, which signals that the current trend might change to bearish. The height of this rounding top pattern indicates that Ripple could plunge by 17.45% from its current price level of $1.76. Technical indicators support the bearish setup depicted by the rounding top pattern. The RSI is leaning towards being oversold and depicts bearish momentum while the ADX lime is also tipping north, another sign that the downtrend is strong. XRP/USDT: 1-day Chart As a recent Coingape article reported, if the XRP price drops below $1.90. It might crash to $1. Given that XRP has already dropped below the neckline of the rounding top, a crash is likely to happen in the near term. XRP’s Liquidation Heatmap Supports Bearish Outlook Besides the rounding top pattern, the liquidation heatmap supports the bearish outlook for XRP . Data from Coinglass shows that there is a hot liquidation zone at $2.05, where many long traders are at risk of being liquidated. XRP Liquidation Heatmap These liquidation zones tend to act as a magnet that pulls the price down. Moreover, the closure of long positions increases selling activity around an asset. This hints towards more bearish trends facing Ripple.

According to the firm, these experienced investors are moving into an accumulation phase, a trend that has historically preceded significant price increases. CryptoQuant identifies four main periods of coin accumulation by experienced market participants: January 2023, October 2023, October 2024, and the current phase in March 2025. These phases are marked with blue circles on the firm’s analysis table. In contrast, four significant selling peaks occurred in January, April, and July of 2024, with the last peak occurring in March 2025, marked with red circles. Related News: Watch Out: 22 Altcoins Will Have Massive Token Unlocks in the New Week - Here's the Day-by-Day, Hour-by-Hour List According to the analyst firm, the current accumulation phase is characterized by several critical factors: Shifting from Sell to Hold – Investors who previously sold at market peaks have now adopted a holding strategy. This is evident from the Value Days Destroyed (VDD) indicator, which is at its minimum in March 2025. Lack of Significant Selling – The lack of significant selling suggests that experienced participants find the current Bitcoin price level unattractive for profit-taking. Historical Precedence for Price Increases – Historical market cycles show that periods of low VDD marked by accumulation phases precede upward price movements. CryptoQuant’s findings suggest that the current accumulation phase could signal further appreciation of Bitcoin’s price in the medium term.

Buckle up, because this week’s economic calendar is packed with pivotal US economic data releases that could significantly sway market sentiment and price action, not just in traditional finance but also in the crypto sphere. For crypto enthusiasts and traders, understanding these economic events this week is not just beneficial—it’s crucial for making informed decisions. Let’s dive into the key events and what they might mean for your crypto portfolio. Decoding the Market Moving Events : What’s on the Horizon? This week isn’t just another week in the financial world; it’s a crucial period where market moving events are slated to unfold. These events, primarily emanating from the United States, are closely watched by investors globally, and for good reason. They offer insights into the health of the world’s largest economy and can trigger significant shifts in asset valuations, including cryptocurrencies. We’re talking about data that can influence the Federal Reserve’s decisions, shape investor sentiment, and ultimately, drive market trends. Tuesday, April 1: Manufacturing Sector in Focus The week kicks off with a double dose of manufacturing data on Tuesday. Why manufacturing? Because it’s often seen as a leading indicator of economic health. Strong manufacturing activity can signal robust economic growth, while weakness can hint at a slowdown. 13:45 UTC: U.S. S&P Global Manufacturing PMI (March) The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) from S&P Global provides a snapshot of business conditions in the manufacturing sector. A reading above 50 indicates expansion, while below 50 signals contraction. Traders will be looking for trends and deviations from expectations. A stronger-than-expected PMI could be interpreted positively for the dollar and potentially weigh slightly on risk assets initially, but overall economic strength is generally seen as positive in the long run. 14:00 UTC: U.S. ISM Manufacturing PMI (March) Shortly after, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) releases its Manufacturing PMI. This is another closely watched indicator, often considered more influential than the S&P Global PMI due to its broader survey scope. Similar to the S&P PMI, the ISM Manufacturing PMI offers insights into manufacturing activity, new orders, employment, and prices. Consistently strong readings across both PMIs would paint a picture of a resilient manufacturing sector, influencing expectations for economic growth and potentially interest rate policy. Wednesday, April 2: Employment Picture Takes Shape Mid-week brings us a preliminary look at the employment situation, ahead of the more comprehensive Nonfarm Payrolls report on Friday. Employment data is critical as it reflects the labor market’s health, a key factor in economic stability and consumer spending. 12:15 UTC: U.S. ADP Nonfarm Employment Change (March) The ADP Nonfarm Employment Change estimates the change in private sector employment. While it’s not always a perfect predictor of the official Nonfarm Payrolls, it provides valuable insights into the direction of employment trends. A strong ADP report could build anticipation for a robust Nonfarm Payrolls figure, potentially leading to market optimism. Conversely, a weak number could raise concerns about economic slowdown. Friday, April 4: The Employment Grand Finale and Fed Speak Friday is undoubtedly the highlight of the week, featuring the highly anticipated Nonfarm Payrolls report and Unemployment Rate, followed by a speech from Fed Chair Powell. This day could be pivotal in setting the market tone for the near future. 12:30 UTC: U.S. Nonfarm Payrolls (March) This is arguably the most important US economic data release of the week. Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) measures the change in the number of employed people during the previous month, excluding the farming industry. It’s a broad indicator of job creation and overall economic activity. A strong NFP number often boosts confidence in the economy and can lead to dollar strength. For crypto, the immediate reaction might be mixed, as a stronger dollar can sometimes pressure crypto prices in the short term. However, robust economic growth is generally positive for all asset classes in the longer run. 12:30 UTC: U.S. Unemployment Rate (March) Released alongside NFP, the Unemployment Rate measures the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed. A low unemployment rate typically indicates a healthy labor market. Combined with strong NFP, a low unemployment rate reinforces the narrative of a strong economy, which can influence the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy stance. 15:25 UTC: U.S. Fed Chair Powell Speaks Capping off the week, a speech from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled. Powell’s remarks are always closely scrutinized for hints about the Fed’s future monetary policy direction, particularly regarding interest rates and inflation. Depending on the context of the economic data released earlier in the week, Powell’s speech could amplify market reactions. For example, if the data points to a strong economy and potential inflationary pressures, hawkish comments from Powell could signal a more aggressive approach to interest rate hikes, potentially impacting risk assets including cryptocurrencies. Conversely, dovish remarks in the face of weaker data could be seen as supportive for risk assets. Crypto Market Impact : Navigating the Volatility So, how do these financial markets events tie into the cryptocurrency world? In today’s interconnected financial landscape, the crypto market is increasingly influenced by macroeconomic factors. Here’s a breakdown of potential impacts: Volatility Spike: Economic data releases, especially surprises (either positive or negative compared to expectations), can trigger immediate volatility in all markets, including crypto. Traders should be prepared for potential price swings around these release times. Dollar Strength/Weakness: Strong US economic data often leads to a stronger US dollar. Historically, a stronger dollar can sometimes exert downward pressure on cryptocurrency prices, as Bitcoin and other cryptos are often priced against the dollar. Conversely, dollar weakness can be crypto-positive. Risk Sentiment: Positive economic data can boost overall risk sentiment, which can be beneficial for risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, weak data can dampen risk appetite, potentially leading to a flight to safety, away from riskier assets. Interest Rate Expectations: All of this data feeds into expectations about future interest rate hikes or cuts by the Federal Reserve. Higher interest rates can make riskier assets like crypto less attractive compared to safer, yield-bearing assets. Conversely, expectations of lower rates can be crypto-positive. Actionable Insights for Crypto Traders Here’s how you can navigate this week’s economic events as a crypto trader or investor: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the economic calendar and be aware of the release times mentioned above. Real-time financial news sources can provide live updates and analysis. Manage Risk: Given the potential for volatility, consider adjusting your trading positions or using risk management tools like stop-loss orders. Avoid over-leveraging during periods of high uncertainty. Watch Market Reactions: Observe how the crypto market reacts to each data release. Pay attention to both immediate price movements and the broader trend that emerges. Consider the Bigger Picture: Don’t just react to each data point in isolation. Consider the overall trend and how these data releases might influence the Federal Reserve’s policy and the broader economic outlook. Diversify: Diversification across different asset classes, including and beyond crypto, can help mitigate risk during periods of economic uncertainty. Conclusion: Staying Ahead in the Crypto Game This week’s economic calendar is set to be a significant driver for financial markets , and the cryptocurrency market will undoubtedly feel its ripples. By understanding the significance of these economic events this week and preparing for potential crypto market impact , you can navigate the week with greater confidence and make more informed trading and investment decisions. Remember, in the fast-paced world of crypto, knowledge and preparation are your greatest assets. Stay vigilant, stay informed, and trade wisely!

Banks may now offer crypto and other legally permitted services without obtaining prior regulatory approval. The crypto regulatory environment in the US received a welcomed policy reversal from the FDIC on Friday. Banks can now offer crypto services without prior regulatory approval if they manage the associated risks. Righting Previously “Flawed” Regulatory Approaches The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a Financial Institution Letter (FIL-7-250) on Friday offering new guidance for FDIC-supervised institutions engaged or looking to engage in crypto-related activities. FIL-7-2025 reverses the agency’s 2022 guidelines requiring all FDIC-supervised institutions that intend to engage or are currently involved in crypto-related activities to notify the FDIC. Under the new guidelines, banks may offer digital asset-related services without prior permission from the FDIC. In a press release , the agency clarified: “The guidance affirms that FDIC-supervised institutions may engage in permissible activities, including activities involving new and emerging technologies such as crypto-assets and digital assets, provided that they adequately manage the associated risks.” FDIC Acting Chairman Travis Hill commented on the policy reversal, explaining the move as part of a new approach to how banks can engage in crypto services according to safety standards. He explained: “With today's action, the FDIC is turning the page on the flawed approach of the past three years.” Adding; ""I expect this to be one of several steps the FDIC will take to lay out a new approach for how banks can engage in crypto and blockchain-related activities in accordance with safety and soundness standards."" Broader Effort from the Trump Administration The FDIC’s newly issued guidelines come amid the Trump Administration’s concerted effort to allow more effortless engagement with digital assets. Donald Trump emerged as a vocal pro-crypto during the 2024 election and has introduced several reforms to the crypto industry since taking office in January 2025. The President signed an executive order pushing for a Strategic Crypto Reserve and has taken several steps to remove regulatory hurdles in the industry. Under the new administration, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has stepped away from its previous crackdown on crypto and crypto-related companies, which devasted the industry under former Chairman Gary Gensler.

Assessing Musk’s Recent Comments,https://cryptopotato.com/is-this-the-final-chapter-for-dogecoins-bull-run-assessing-musks-recent-comments/,"TL;DR Despite the rumors and speculations that the Musk-led D.O.G.E. might use the meme coin, the billionaire refuted the claims on Sunday evening. While such a statement by Doge’s most famous proponent could hurt the asset, certain technical aspects indicate that there could be some gains around the corner. No DOGE to Be Used During Trump’s presidential campaign last year, one of the groundbreaking promises made by him and people close to him, in this case Elon Musk, was the creation of a government department that would ‘identify and eliminate wasteful government spending, aiming to reduce federal expenditures by $1 trillion.’ Its name, Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E.), and Musk’s leadership role led to immense excitement in the meme coin community. Moreover, people started speculating that Dogecoin would eventually be used in some form and that it would benefit from the name resemblance. The rumors were fueled by the addition of the meme coin’s logo to the D.O.G.E. website just a day after Trump’s inauguration. All of this hype resulted in a massive rally for Dogecoin, as its price skyrocketed from $0.14 ahead of the elections to a multi-year peak of $0.48 a month later. However, DOGE has failed to maintain its run and has dropped by over 60% since the January peak of $0.42, as it now struggles at $0.163. What could be even worse for DOGE’s upcoming price movements is the fact that Musk refuted the aforementioned rumors on Sunday. Speaking in a Town Hall meeting in Wisconsin, the Tesla CEO said the government has no plans to use DOGE in any form. “They happen to be similar names, but really, we’re literally just trying to make the government 15% more efficient.” The End or Not? Musk’s statement could be regarded as a big blow to Dogecoin’s bull run aspirations, especially since the asset is far from this cycle’s peak. However, there are certain positive signs on the technical side of things, as laid out by Ali Martinez. The analyst noted that the TD Sequential has posted a buy signal on the weekly chart and added that as long as DOGE’s price remains above the lower boundary of the channel posted below, it could reignite another surge. #Dogecoin $DOGE continues to hold above the lower boundary of this channel.

The hourly price chart confirms bears are making efforts to prevent the Ren price from an immediate surge. However, if the Ren price successfully breaks above $0.01174, it may surge higher and touch the resistance at $0.0159. If bulls cannot initiate a surge, Ren price may drop below the immediate support line at $0.008, resulting in a correction to $0.00544. Is Ren a Good Investment? The Ren protocol, formerly known as Republic Protocol, enables interoperability across various blockchains, allowing users to transfer cryptocurrencies seamlessly. Users can lock cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Bitcoin Cash (BCH), and Zcash (ZEC) into the Ren software. In return, they mint equivalent ERC-20 tokens—RenBTC, RenBCH, and RenZEC—on a 1:1 ratio within the Ethereum ecosystem. As REN price is set to surge further, it can be a good investment option in the long run. As with any cryptocurrency investment, conducting thorough research is crucial before investing in REN. Why is the REN Price Down Today? REN price witnessed a bearish reversal as sellers are strongly defending the resistance channels around $0.01. Will REN Price Reach $1? REN price might soon reach the $1 mark in 2035 if the buying demand continues to surge and Ren attracts altcoin investors. Will REN Price Reach $10? Due to the effort of the community, Ren Coin’s prices will continue to increase. However, there is currently no indication that the Ren (REN) Coin will reach $10 in the near future, which is a long-term target. Is REN a Good Long-Term Investment? REN has gained popularity thanks to strong community support. However, it’s crucial to conduct thorough research into their long-term potential to determine if it represents a viable long-term investment. REN Price Prediction April 2025 Over the last few days, REN coin price has been on a downward trend and it aims to drop below crucial Fib levels.

Then hacks happen. In some cases, billions vanish overnight. On Feb. 21, 2025, the North Korean Lazarus Group stole $1.46 billion from Bybit . They sent phishing emails to staff with cold wallet access. After compromising these accounts, they accessed Bybit’s interface and replaced the multisignature wallet contract with their malicious version. When Bybit attempted a routine transfer, the hackers redirected 499,000 Ether ( ETH ) to addresses they controlled. This wasn’t just a human error. This was a design failure. A system that allows human factors to enable a billion-dollar theft isn’t innovative — it’s irresponsible. People are not protected In just 10 days, the hackers converted all 499,000 ETH into untraceable funds, using THORChain as their primary channel. The decentralized exchange processed a record $4.66 billion in swaps in a week but implemented no safeguards against suspicious activity. The crypto industry has created a system that cannot protect users even after they discover a theft. Some services actually profited from this crime, collecting millions in fees while processing the laundering of stolen funds. Recent: SafeWallet releases Bybit hack post-mortem report In February 2025, investigators ZachXBT and Tanuki42 revealed that Coinbase users lost over $300 million annually to social engineering attacks. Their report showed $65 million stolen through phishing and other social manipulation techniques in December 2024 and January 2025. According to the investigators, Coinbase failed to address known security vulnerabilities in their API keys and verification systems that make these human-targeted attacks successful. ZachXBT directly criticized the exchange for having “useless customer support agents” and failing to properly report theft addresses to blockchain monitoring tools, making stolen funds harder to track. One scammer even admitted to targeting wealthy users, claiming they make at least five figures a week. These aren’t isolated cases. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation reported that ordinary crypto users lost over $5.6 billion to fraud in 2023 , and social engineering drove at least half of these schemes. Americans alone lose approximately $2 billion–$3 billion annually to human vulnerability attacks. With over 600 million crypto users worldwide, conservative estimates put individual losses from social engineering at $6 billion–$15 billion in 2024. Barrier to adoption Security concerns are now recognized as the main barrier to adoption by 37% of crypto users worldwide. Meanwhile, the industry continues to promote high-risk speculative assets like memecoins, where average users typically lose money while insiders profit. While founders pitch financial freedom, millions of real people lose their savings through vulnerabilities the industry refuses to address. They’re symptoms of a fundamental problem: Crypto builders choose marketing over security. When disasters happen, and they face pressure about security failures, crypto leaders hide behind blockchain’s “code is law” principle and offer philosophical arguments about self-sovereignty and personal responsibility. The crypto industry loves to blame ordinary users: “Don’t store keys online,” “Check addresses before sending,” “Never open suspicious files.” Nobody is safe Even industry leaders themselves fall victim to the same basic attacks. In January 2024, Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen lost 283 million XRP ( XRP ) due to storing private keys in an online password manager. DeFiance Capital founder Arthur_0x lost $1.6 million in non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and cryptocurrency simply by opening a phishing PDF file. These people aren’t naive beginners — they’re creators and experts of the very system that could not protect even them. They know all the security rules, but the human factor is inevitable. If even the system architects lose millions, what chance do ordinary users have? Knowledge of security rules doesn’t provide complete protection because fever, stress, sleep deprivation or emotional distress severely affect our decision-making abilities. Attackers continuously test different approaches, waiting for moments when users become vulnerable. They evolve their tactics constantly, creating increasingly convincing scenarios, impersonations and urgent situations. The unchangeable nature of blockchain transactions demands extraordinary safeguards — not fewer. If users can’t reverse mistakes or thefts, the system must prevent them in the first place. True innovation means building systems that work for real humans, not theoretically perfect users. Banks learned this lesson over centuries. Crypto builders must learn it faster. Instead, industry leaders seem to have lost touch with reality due to the extreme wealth dumped on them quickly. They’ve bought into their PR narrative, portraying them as geniuses, and started viewing themselves as visionaries. A call to action Vitalik Buterin lectures his audience on voting in elections and polishes his manifesto , while Justin Sun spends $6.2 million on a banana for a “unique artistic experience” — all while building an environment that makes dangerous mistakes easy to make. This approach is fundamentally dishonest. You can’t claim to revolutionize finance while providing less security than the systems you’re replacing. What technical brilliance exists in systems that permit billion-dollar thefts and systematic fraud of ordinary users with such ease? As a core function, true technical excellence would include protecting users from permanent financial loss. A financial system that cannot secure its users’ assets is not technically advanced — it’s fundamentally incomplete. It’s time to stop writing manifestos and promoting questionable PR stunts designed to attract a broader and more vulnerable audience. Start building genuine protections that match the level of risk your users face. No amount of blockchain innovation matters if ordinary people cannot use these systems without fear of instant, permanent financial loss. Anything less is just reckless experimentation at users’ expense disguised as a revolution — a scheme that enriches founders and insiders while ordinary people bear all the risks. If the industry doesn’t solve this problem, regulators will — and you won’t like their solutions. Your philosophical arguments about self-sovereignty won’t matter when licenses are revoked and operations shut down. This is the choice crypto builders face: Either create truly secure systems that justify your claims about financial innovation or watch as regulators transform your “revolutionary technology” into another heavily regulated financial service.

According to a Mar. 31 press release statement , AUSTRAC’s cryptocurrency task force has found signs of suspicious transactions and fraud, raising concerns about the growing number of crypto ATMs. Since December, the task force has been working with businesses to check if they are following AML and counter-terrorism financing rules. AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas issued a warning, saying that although the agency is assisting companies in improving compliance, those who do not adhere to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing regulations will be subject to consequences. “We will continue to work with industry to raise standards, but we will also take action against operators who don’t comply.” — Brendan Thomas, AUSTRAC CEO Australia now has the largest market in the Asia-Pacific region, with about 1,648 cryptocurrency ATMs, compared to just 23 in 2019 and 60 in 2022. There are 348 machines in Sydney alone. Most accept cash deposits for Bitcoin ( BTC ) purchases, which raises the possibility that criminals could use them to transfer illicit funds.

Crypto ATM operators are required to register with AUSTRAC and adhere to AML/CTF regulations, which include transaction monitoring, customer identity verification, and reporting suspicious activity. AUSTRAC has warned that non- compliant companies may be subject to steep fines and has promised to step up enforcement. This crackdown coincides with a slowdown in the global crypto ATM market due to regulatory pressures. Coin ATM Radar’s latest report shows that over 1,000 Bitcoin ATMs were taken out of service globally in February. The overall number has decreased by 2,062 since late 2022. With more than 78% of crypto ATMs in operation, the United States leads the global crypto ATM market, followed by Canada with 9.2%. Australia and Europe each account for just over 4% of the global network.

Which One Of These Is Predicted To 50x By August",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/chainlink-hedera-or-remittix-which-one-of-these-is-predicted-to-50x-by-august/,"In recent Chainlink news and under the eyes of investors tracking the Hedera price closely, analysts are weighing which altcoin, Chainlink, Hedera, or Remittix is likely to climb 50x by August. Chainlink just couldn’t hold on to bull positions, while Hedera is growing slowly. But it’s Remittix that now sees significant investor interest, standing apart in the world of crypto through its utility-oriented model. Let’s take a close look at why Remittix could outperform Chainlink and Hedera when it comes to potential profit and long-term investor returns. Chainlink News: Can LINK Recover After Price Drop? Chainlink news has not been favorable to LINK investors recently. Traded at $13.50, Chainlink is 1.33% down and struggling to gain bullish traction. Chainlink remains a robust player in the DeFi oracle space with a market cap of $8.91 billion. Nevertheless, declining trading volumes, at 13.91% down to $236.85 million, point to weakening investor confidence. Chainlink remains essential to decentralized finance applications. However, poor adoption, high competition, and its recent poor performance are concerns. Experts caution that if Chainlink fails to trigger new investments or forge solid partnerships, its price recovery might still be hindered. Investors are therefore prioritizing more favorable options. While Chainlink languishes in limbo, Remittix is bursting out robustly, promising improved returns. In contrast to Chainlink, Remittix is already experiencing faster adoption and investor interest due to its intentionality and immediate real-world application in cross-border payments, drawing in directly those seeking stability and growth. Hedera Price: Moderate Growth but Restricted Momentum Although Hedera’s price recently saw an uptick of a mere 0.07% to $0.1701, its small increase questions future performance. With a market cap of $7.18 billion, indicating a steady, if uneventful, market standing, Hedera sees its trading volume drop by 17.59%, to $172.29 million, showing abysmal investor interest. Even with its cutting-edge Hashgraph technology, Hedera is in competition with other faster and more affordable blockchain technologies. Skeptics believe that without extensive network growth or major partnerships, Hedera’s development may plateau. Speculators looking for explosive returns are doubtful if Hedera’s price can actually be 50x in the near term. Once again, Remittix is a contrast. With its robust transactional capabilities and immediate utility in the emerging cross-border payments market, Remittix offers investors more defined growth opportunities and is already generating plenty of buzz, precisely where Hedera seems to falter. Why Investors Are Bullish On Remittix As Chainlink falters and Hedera’s price is low-key, Remittix is quickly building investor trust with more than $14.2 million raised so far this year. Priced affordably at $0.0734 with more than 524 million tokens sold, Remittix’s innovative PayFi model speeds international transactions up, reduces costs, and keeps them secure. Consider a Latin American retailer who previously had to withstand the onerous banking fees and slow international payments. With Remittix, these kinds of transactions are instant and very inexpensive, and it is feasible for ordinary global commerce. This real-world use sets Remittix apart from Chainlink’s speculative potential and Hedera’s embryonic system. Analysts predict Remittix could replicate the rapid uptake of previous cross-border tokens like XRP and Stellar and hit 50x returns by August. The current market climate where investors prefer tangible utility over speculation explains Remittix’s uptake and growing popularity Investors Prefer Remittix for Highest Returns While Chainlink news is tepid, and Hedera price rises incrementally only, Remittix shines with immediate investor interest. Its applications in the real world solve real problems, and they fit the market demands perfectly. Investors are more interested in platforms delivering concrete advantages than in fantasy projects. Industry insiders stress that this trend for pragmatic usability strongly favors Remittix over Chainlink and Hedera. For those investors who seek big returns through August, Remittix is clearly the best-positioned among these three promising projects. With a strong adoption plan, strong community support, and strong real-world applications, Remittix appears well-positioned to achieve its goal of explosive growth. Investors looking at these alternatives need to consider the short-term advantages Remittix brings to the crypto community.

His approach emphasizes strategic profit management rather than being swept away by short-term market gains. Pantoja stresses that reaching a seven-figure portfolio does not automatically translate to financial security. Instead, he argues that true financial stability depends on effectively managing the profits generated from an initial investment. He suggests that investors should view themselves as having access to only 10% of their portfolio’s value annually to avoid excessive risk. So, you make $1,000,000 in $XRP $BTC $DOGE $ETH or any other crypto. What's next? How do you turn that one big win into a lifetime of wealth? Here are 4 secrets that helped me: pic.twitter.com/SIzSIqiUwe — Armando Pantoja (@_TallGuyTycoon) March 26, 2025 Developing a Strong Investment Plan Pantoja recommends XRP as a foundational asset for building wealth in the cryptocurrency market. However, he warns against over-concentration in a single digital asset. To mitigate risk, he advises diversifying investments across multiple cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, according to him, offers portfolio stability, while Ethereum provides opportunities for passive income through staking. He also highlights the potential of other assets, such as Stellar (XLM), which can contribute to a well-rounded crypto portfolio. Another key recommendation is securing long-term holdings by transferring them to cold storage. Pantoja warns that leaving funds on exchanges exposes investors to security risks, including potential hacks and market volatility. Keeping assets off exchanges minimizes these threats and ensures greater control over investments. Expanding Wealth Through Passive Income Streams Beyond holding digital assets, he further underscores the importance of developing passive income streams. He suggests staking select cryptocurrencies on reputable platforms as a means of earning consistent returns. He also advocates for using cryptocurrency as collateral for loans rather than selling holdings. Borrowing against crypto holdings allows investors to access liquidity while avoiding taxable events that could reduce their overall portfolio value. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Pantoja encourages reinvesting borrowed funds into assets that generate steady income, such as dividend-paying stocks, rental properties, farmland, or real estate investment trusts (REITs) . This strategy ensures financial growth without depleting the principal investment. Protecting and Enhancing Financial Gains To safeguard accumulated wealth, Pantoja recommends utilizing tax-efficient structures such as trusts, LLCs, and tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs. These options help investors legally minimize tax obligations while growing their capital. Additionally, he advises those looking to expand their financial security to consider building a business. According to the investor, a well-structured business can generate a reliable monthly income, ranging from $6,000 to $15,000, creating long-term financial sustainability. His final piece of advice is to maintain a disciplined approach to wealth management. He emphasizes that successful investors do not spend their principal but rather generate income from their investments. By adopting this mindset, individuals can transition from making a million dollars to keeping it—and growing it over time.

Here’s What Analysts Say,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-magacoinfinance-outperform-ethereum-in-2025-heres-what-analysts-say/,"Ethereum has long been the foundation of decentralized finance, smart contracts, and blockchain innovation. But a fresh contender is now entering the conversation—MAGACOINFINANCE. While Ethereum fine-tunes scalability and gas efficiency, MAGACOINFINANCE is catching fire in its pre-sale, leading some analysts to question if this underdog could pull off one of 2025’s biggest surprises.

Current Market Insights on ETH, XRP, INJ, and BCH Ethereum (ETH) – Priced at $1,832, Ethereum leads all smart contract platforms but continues to wrestle with scalability and fees despite major upgrades. XRP (Ripple) – At $2.16, XRP’s legal clarity has sparked renewed interest as Ripple’s payment infrastructure gains traction in institutional finance. Injective (INJ) – Trading at $8.95, INJ supports a fast-expanding decentralized trading ecosystem, with cross-chain capabilities and derivatives support. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) – Sitting at $306, BCH remains relevant for fast, low-fee peer-to-peer payments, and continues to serve as a practical BTC alternative.

However, the news is still meaningful for the crypto world – it’s just the uncertainty coming out of the White House that’s disabling BTC price from celebrating it fully. Once the macro environment stabilises, it’s believable that the digital asset will resume its upward trajectory, hopefully pulling the rest of the crypto market, including the up-and-coming meme tokens, like Bitcoin Pepe , up with it. Why is GME news significant for Bitcoin Pepe? GameStop’s choice to become an institutional investor of Bitcoin is a significant development since it could improve legitimacy and increase demand for crypto coins. Since the BTC itself is still going for well over $80,000, a huge part of the retail community may find it beyond reach and choose to invest in the likes of Bitcoin Pepe instead, particularly since the meme coins have a history of offering explosive returns in early stages. In fact, that narrative is already showing in Bitcoin Pepe’s ongoing presale, which has raised close to $5.8 million within weeks. If you’re interested in learning more about Bitcoin Pepe and its native crypto coin, click here to visit the project’s website now. The new SEC is committed to crypto regulation Bitcoin Pepe may be an exciting investment for this year also because Paul Atkins, President Donald Trump’s nominee to head the US Securities and Exchange Commission, reiterated crypto regulation as a top priority last week. Atkins pledged to build a “rational, coherent, and principled” framework for cryptocurrencies at his confirmation hearing before the Senate on March 27. His remarks are significant since regulatory uncertainty has long been a headwind for digital assets. Once the Trump administration delivers on its promise of improvement on that front, crypto coins, including the likes of Bitcoin Pepe, could rally in 2025. Visit the website at this link to explore ways to invest in Bitcoin Pepe today. Should you invest in Bitcoin Pepe today? After the presale, devs have plans of listing Bitcoin Pepe on a notable crypto exchange that often drives interest and helps push the price of the token further up. Additionally, the Federal Reserve remains committed to two rate cuts in 2025. As interest rates lower, risk-on assets like cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin Pepe, could appear more attractive for investors. All in all, there are several tailwinds, some on the macro level and some Bitcoin Pepe-specific, that indicate potential for significant upside in the platform’s native meme coin.

At the current level, 1 ETH is the equivalent of 0.02191 BTC. That's the least since May 2020, when ether was trading around $200 and bitcoin just under $10,000. Today the ETH price is about $1,800 and the BTC price around $82,000. The underperformance is notable because it's the first time ether has weakened against bitcoin in the 12 months after a BTC reward halving . On April 20, 2024, the payment Bitcoin miners received for confirming blocks on the blockchain was reduced by 50% to 3.125 BTC. In previous halving cycles, ether outperformed bitcoin in the first year after a halving. This time, the ratio has dropped by more than 50%. That's partly because the threat of a tariff-driven trade war, persistent inflation and elevated bonds yields globally have driven investors to assets seen as more liquid and less risky. Gold, the ultimate haven, has climbed to record highs, and in the cryptocurrency market bitcoin is seen as a safer bet than ether. This relative performance also marks one of ether’s worst quarterly performances against bitcoin in several years, according to data from Glassnode. The last time ether underperformed bitcoin to a similar degree was in the third quarter of 2019, when the ratio dropped to 0.0164, a quarterly decline of 46%. This current slump mirrors the underperformance seen in 2019 and further highlights ether's relative weakness, especially when compared to other layer-1 assets . The SOLETH ratio — measuring the value of Solana’s SOL relative to ether — is up 24% year-to-date to 0.07007. This indicates that SOL has significantly outperformed ether in 2025, despite the token itself itself being down 35% year-to-date.

The analyst expressed concerns over influencers promoting unrealistic targets, such as claims that XRP would reach $100 within a month or surge to $10,000 overnight. According to All Things XRP, such projections do not contribute positively to the community and instead foster misleading expectations. The analyst emphasized the need for responsible discourse, stating that the community is becoming increasingly aware of exaggerated claims. According to All Things XRP, many XRP holders are growing frustrated and are looking for leadership grounded in facts rather than sensationalism. The analyst noted a commitment to providing fact-based insights that support the growth of the community and stressed the importance of higher standards in cryptocurrency discussions. Community Response to the Statement X user Michael Halatek responded to All Things XRP’s post by supporting the call for more responsible messaging. Halatek stated that he had made a similar argument, describing it as an issue that needed to be addressed. He referenced an instance where a single XRP influencer posted multiple contradictory price predictions—ranging from $44 to $10,000—within six hours. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 According to Halatek, such behavior is motivated by financial gain, with influencers seeking engagement for profit rather than providing useful information. He suggested that community administrators should take action against those who engage in misleading speculation, arguing that their content does not offer any real value to XRP holders. The Push for Higher Standards in Crypto Discourse The discussion initiated by All Things XRP highlights an ongoing concern about misinformation within the cryptocurrency space. The analyst’s message calls for a shift toward a more fact-driven approach, asserting that responsible communication is necessary for mainstream adoption. The post suggests that the credibility of the XRP community could be strengthened by moving away from hype-driven narratives and focusing on realistic assessments. While price speculation is a common aspect of cryptocurrency discussions, the response to All Things XRP’s post reflects a sentiment among some XRP holders that exaggerated predictions are causing more harm than good. The push for higher standards in discourse aligns with broader efforts to establish a more informed and trustworthy crypto environment.

Meanwhile, the crypto space is still reeling from the massive $1.4 billion Bybit exchange hack in February, which was orchestrated by North Korea’s Lazarus Group. In parallel, cybersecurity firm Threat Fabric uncovered a new Android malware, Crocodilus, that is designed to steal crypto wallet seed phrases through fake overlay screens and social engineering tactics. SIR.trading Hit by Major Hack The Ethereum-based DeFi protocol SIR.trading, which is also known as Synthetics Implemented Right, suffered a devastating hack that resulted in the complete loss of its total value locked (TVL). The protocol’s TVL amounted to close to $355,000 at the time of the attack. The exploit happened on March 30 and was first flagged by blockchain security firms TenArmorAlert and Decurity , both of which issued warnings on social media to alert the community. After the incident, the protocol’s pseudonymous founder, Xatarrer, described the hack as ”the worst news a protocol could receive” but expressed hope that the team will try to keep the project alive despite the severe setback. According to Decurity’s analysis, the attack was executed through a sophisticated manipulation of a callback function in SIR.trading’s vulnerable Vault contract. This function relied on Ethereum's transient storage feature that was introduced in last year’s Dencun upgrade. The attacker was able to exploit this feature by substituting the real Uniswap pool address used in the callback with an address they controlled. This made it possible for them to siphon the protocol's funds into their own wallet. Blockchain security firm TenArmorAlert explained that the attacker repeatedly triggered this callback function to fully drain the vault’s assets. SupLabsYi , a researcher from security firm Supremacy, offered some more technical details into the hack, and stated that it may point to an emerging security flaw in Ethereum’s transient storage mechanism. This feature was designed to allow for cheaper, temporary data storage, reducing gas fees, but it is still relatively new and untested at scale. The attack on SIR.trading is one of the first known exploits targeting its potential vulnerabilities. After the exploit, TenArmorAlert reported that the stolen funds were moved to an address funded via Ethereum’s privacy solution Railgun. SIR.trading’s founder has since reached out to Railgun in an effort to track or recover the stolen assets. The protocol prided itself in being a safer alternative for leveraged trading, and previously disclosed in its documentation that despite audits, its smart contracts could contain undetected bugs. It specifically pointed to the vault mechanisms as a potential area of vulnerability due to their complex logic. Crypto’s Biggest Hack Other exploits also recently turned heads in the crypto space. It seems like North Korea-affiliated hackers scaled back their operations during the second half of 2024 while preparing for what would become the largest crypto hack in history. The industry was shaken on Feb. 21 when the Lazarus Group, which is a notorious hacking collective linked to North Korea, orchestrated a sophisticated attack on the crypto exchange Bybit. This attack resulted in the theft of more than $1.4 billion. According to blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis , illicit activity tied to North Korean cyber actors declined after July 1 of 2024, despite a surge in attacks earlier that year. Eric Jardine, Chainalysis’ cybercrimes research lead, suggested that this slowdown coincided with geopolitical developments, particularly the summit between Russia and North Korea. This meeting reportedly led to the reallocation of North Korean resources, including military personnel, to help in Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. Jardine speculated that this shift may have also allowed the Lazarus Group to regroup, select new targets, and prepare for the massive Bybit attack. (Source: Chainlaysis ) The attack was executed with precision, and the hackers were able to launder the stolen funds through the decentralized cross-chain protocol THORChain within just ten days. Despite this, blockchain security experts were still optimistic that at least a portion of the funds could still be recovered. The Bybit hack shed some light on the vulnerability of even the most secure centralized exchanges to highly sophisticated cyberattacks. Analysts noticed that the incident had similarities to other major hacks, like the $230 million attack on WazirX and the $58 million exploit on Radiant Capital. Meir Dolev, co-founder and CTO of blockchain security firm Cyvers, explained that the attackers compromised an Ethereum multisig cold wallet by tricking signers into unknowingly approving a change to the smart contract’s logic. This deceptive transaction allowed the hackers to seize control of the wallet and drain its contents. North Korea hacking activity (Source: Chainalysis ) Throughout 2024 , North Korean hackers were responsible for stealing more than $1.34 billion worth of digital assets across 47 separate incidents, according to Chainalysis. This was a 102% increase from the $660 million that was stolen in 2023 and accounted for an alarming 61% of all crypto stolen globally last year. Crocodilus Malware Targets Crypto Wallets Exploits are not the only danger threatening crypto users and their funds. Cybersecurity firm Threat Fabric recently uncovered a new and highly sophisticated malware targeting Android users, and it is specifically designed to steal cryptocurrency seed phrases and take over devices. The malware is called Crocodilus, and it employs fake overlay screens to deceive users into revealing sensitive information, including the recovery phrases of their crypto wallets. In a report that was published on March 28, Threat Fabric analysts shared details about how Crocodilus manipulates victims by displaying a warning message urging them to back up their wallet key in a specific time frame, typically 12 hours, or risk losing access to their funds. This social engineering tactic leads users to their seed phrase, which the malware then captures using its accessibility logger. Once the seed phrase is obtained, the attackers gain full control over the victim's wallet and can drain its contents. Crocodilus not only targets crypto wallets but also possesses the advanced capabilities of modern banking malware. It can harvest data through screen captures, launch fake overlay attacks, and remotely control infected devices. The infection typically occurs when users inadvertently download software embedded with the malware, which bypasses Android 13's built-in security protections. Example of the overlays used (Source: Threat Fabric ) After installation, Crocodilus prompts users to enable accessibility services, which is a request that allows the malware to communicate with its command-and-control server. This connection enables it to receive instructions, including which applications to target and which overlays to use. The malware runs continuously in the background, monitoring app activity and launching overlays when targeted apps, particularly banking or crypto apps, are opened. During this process, it can mute the device's sound and operate without the user's knowledge. Threat Fabric’s research indicates that Crocodilus primarily targeted users in Turkey and Spain so far, but the firm warned that the scope of the attack is likely to expand. Analysts also pointed out indications in the malware's code suggesting the developers may speak Turkish and speculated that the threat actor known as Sybra could be involved.",News|Security,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|ETH|ASIA|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-31 09:13:57

In a new video, the analyst uses global M2 money supply – which measures the amount of money flowing throughout the financial system – to forecast potential price targets for Bitcon on the premise that newly created money supply could partially flow into BTC. InvestAnswers says that the most reasonable expectation is that about 0.5% of the newly created supply would flow into Bitcoin, which, according to his models, would bump the price to roughly $115,000. “Bitcoins in circulation are 15 million, remember five million are lost and the current Bitcoin market cap is $1.637 trillion, the new Bitcoin price would go to $146,000, if one percent of this new level of assets goes into Bitcoin. I don’t believe it’s going to be that high, I think it could more along the lines of half of one percent or a quarter of one percent. It depends on adoption, it depends on nation-state game theory. Maybe there’s a nation that’s going to be printing some of their fiat and buying Bitcoin, then you could throw this table away, it’s going to be a lot higher if that’s the case. Because the first nation-state to print money to buy Bitcoin wins. That’s it. So imagine if just half of one percent of the new global M2 goes into Bitcoin – [which is] reasonable, perhaps – the price would go to $115,000. That would increase the price by 37.58% – which a lot of people are groaning and saying ‘$115,000, that’s no good, I want a million dollars’ – well, that’s not the way markets work. There are still a lot of people out there predicting a half-million-dollar Bitcoin by the end of the year. I don’t believe in that. $250,000, I don’t believe in that. $120,000? Maybe, if things really kick off in game theory… My target was always like $119,000, $120,000 for the longest time, going back to 2023. We’ll see if we get there.” Source: InvestAnswers/YouTube At time of writing, Bitcoin is worth $82,100.

Known as SIR.trading, the protocol lost around $355,000 in the 30 March attack, with DeFiLlama data confirming its TVL has since dropped to zero. SIR.trading had positioned itself as “a new DeFi protocol for safer leverage,” with the goal of reducing risks like volatility decay and liquidation. How was SIR.trading exploited? Blockchain security firm Decurity called the incident a “clever attack” that exploited a vulnerability in the protocol’s vault contract. The issue was tied to the uniswapV3SwapCallback function, which leverages Ethereum’s transient storage, a new feature introduced in last year’s Dencun upgrade. According to the firm, the attacker managed to replace the legitimate Uniswap pool address in this callback function with their own, allowing them to redirect the vault’s funds. The vault’s logic didn’t properly validate the callback source, and the use of transient storage let the attacker manipulate temporary data mid-transaction. By repeatedly calling the vulnerable function, they were able to drain all assets from the vault. In a separate post-incident commentary, blockchain researcher SupLabsYi of Supremacy highlighted that the attack may have exposed a broader issue with Ethereum’s transient storage itself. He explained that transient storage only resets after the transaction ends, allowing the attacker to overwrite critical security data before the function finishes executing, adding: What’s striking is that transient storage, introduced via EIP-1153 in the Dencun hard fork , is still a nascent feature. This may be one of the first real-world attacks exploiting its vulnerabilities and may signal further changes in attack trends. In this case, the attacker was able to brute-force a vanity address to make the fake pool look legitimate and used a custom contract to complete the exploit. TenArmor, another blockchain research firm and one of the first to flag the incident on X, added that the stolen funds were quickly transferred into an address funded through the Ethereum privacy platform Railgun. The project’s founder, who identifies as Xatarrer, has reached out to Railgun for assistance. In an earlier message to the community, Xatarrer described the exploit as “the worst news a protocol could receive,” but said they were open to rebuilding and called for feedback on next steps. DeFi exploits remain a consistent threat As DeFi continues to innovate, so do the tactics of attackers, with SIR.trading now joining a roster of exploited protocols in recent weeks. On March 19, Four.Meme, a BNB Chain-based memecoin launch platform, suspended its token launch feature after a critical vulnerability in one of the protocol’s functions allowed an attacker to manipulate the platform’s smart contract. Prior to this attack, Four.Meme suffered another attack on February 11, which also led to the temporary suspension of its token liquidity pool on PancakeSwap. During the same month, decentralised lending protocol zkLend was drained of over $9 million following what the developers described as an empty market exploit. According to a January report from web3 security firm PeckShield, in 2024, defi protocols were the most targeted. Crypto investors lost $3.01 billion, making a roughly 15% increase from the previous year.

With TRX currently trading at $0.23 and ADA at $0.71, both have shown resilience in the market, but many investors are now diversifying into an emerging altcoin with the potential for exponential growth. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens are available in Phase 4 presale for $0.025 per token during the present phase. Phase 5 price will increase to $0.03 after the phase 4 finishes. Since its launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) collected $5.8 million through the investments of more than 7500 holders. Analysts project that Mutuum Finance assets will experience an astonishing growth to $3 after launch. Investors have less time before phase 4 completes. Mutuum Finance: Transforming DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance has succeeded in attracting many investors through its attractive opportunity structure. Mutuum Finance introduces innovative financial services through its next-generation dual-lending approach which combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems. The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) smart contracts operate lending pools through the process of receiving USDT stablecoins to issue ETH asset-backed loans. Users maintain exclusive ownership of their confidential loan arrangements through the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) system because it operates without requiring any intermediaries. Users can access maximum security and adaptive operations together with profit generation through current APY rates that reach up to 10% during liquidity provision. The platform prioritizes both security and transparency by having third-party examine all procedures and implementing open-source smart contracts to build user trust. The platform will stabilize its operations through introducing a stablecoin which is backed by USD value together with fee-supported token buyback procedures to maintain price stability over the duration. Stakeholders who can obtain staking rewards gain financial incentives for keeping their liquidity on the platform thus building stronger confidence throughout the system. The platform registers growing popularity because it has gained over 5700 investors. Exclusive Early Investment Opportunity Throughout the Phase 4 presale event people may purchase MUTM tokens at a value of $0.025. Throughout its 11-staged sale period the MUTM token price growth will expand from $0.025 to $0.06 to create up to 140% investor gains before trading commencement. Market experts predict that MUTM tokens will achieve a price of $3 after the launch becoming a leading DeFi token in 2025. Investors who participated in the first phase and purchased MUTM tokens at the opining $0.01 price point will receive 600% instant profit and the current MUTM capital now exceeds $5.8 million. $100,000 Giveaway & Community Incentives Mutuum Finance is set to achieve wider adoption through its prize giveaway of $100,000 for donating ten $10,000 MUTM tokens to users.

42689915,https://coinpaper.com/8284/binance-unlocks-direct-dex-trading-for-centralized-wallet-holders,1743413400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Binance Unlocks Direct DEX Trading for Centralized Wallet Holders,https://coinpaper.com/8284/binance-unlocks-direct-dex-trading-for-centralized-wallet-holders,"The cryptocurrency sector is witnessing two contrasting developments, highlighting the ongoing efforts and challenges in driving mainstream adoption. Binance has introduced a new feature allowing users to trade directly from their centralized exchange (CEX) wallets to decentralized exchanges (DEX), aiming to simplify the user experience and bridge the gap between CEX and DeFi platforms. Meanwhile, Uniswap, one of the largest decentralized exchanges, is facing a noticeable decline in visibility and user engagement, with its US App Store ranking and trading activity dropping significantly in recent months. Binance Launches Seamless CEX-to-DEX Trading in Push to Simplify Crypto Experience Binance , the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has launched a groundbreaking feature that allows users to trade directly from its centralized exchange (CEX) to decentralized exchanges (DEX), marking a significant step forward in addressing crypto's long-standing user experience barriers. The new integration enables Binance customers to utilize funds stored in their CEX wallets to execute trades on leading DEX platforms without the need for manual asset bridging, wallet switching, or cumbersome token transfers — processes that have historically deterred many newcomers from engaging with decentralized finance (DeFi). In an official announcement, Binance revealed that the new CEX-to-DEX trade feature supports transactions across multiple blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Solana, Base, and BNB Smart Chain. Users can now use USDC — Circle’s dollar-pegged stablecoin — and other supported stablecoins directly from their Binance accounts to acquire tokens available on DEXs in these ecosystems. Binance stated that this feature is fully integrated with other key services on its platform, including Binance Alpha, which gives users early access to emerging tokens, and the Binance Quick Buy tool, which simplifies the purchase of digital assets. By eliminating the need for asset bridging, which typically involves transferring tokens from one blockchain to another via third-party protocols, Binance’s new offering seeks to reduce the technical complexity and security risks associated with interacting with DeFi platforms. This move by Binance directly targets one of the crypto industry’s most significant hurdles: the complicated and often intimidating user experience. Crypto has long been plagued by complex user interfaces, confusing wallet setups, and fragmented liquidity across different blockchains. These challenges have frequently prevented mainstream users from interacting with decentralized finance protocols and fully participating in the broader Web3 economy. An online meme circulating in crypto communities pokes fun at this very issue, likening the multi-step process of interacting with DeFi platforms to ”solving a Rubik's Cube blindfolded.” Binance’s latest initiative attempts to remove that blindfold. The feature aligns with broader efforts across the crypto industry to streamline user experiences and make DeFi more accessible. In November 2024, the WalletConnect Foundation and Reown introduced a standard framework for crypto wallets to simplify wallet interactions and reduce transactional friction. Pedro Gomes, director of the WalletConnect Foundation, explained at the time that the framework was focused on ”minimizing clicks, reducing transaction friction, improving interoperability, and providing clear and accessible information.” Industry leaders like Anurag Arjun, co-founder of Avail and the Polygon Layer-2 network, have also pointed out that blockchain abstraction techniques have contributed to fragmentation across ecosystems. Arjun emphasized that bridging assets across networks is not only cumbersome but also introduces unnecessary risks and confusion for users. Similarly, Sandeep Nailwal, who co-founded Polygon alongside Arjun, recently likened the current state of the crypto space to the internet of the late 1990s — an era defined by clunky interfaces and limited accessibility. Nailwal argued that smoother onboarding, better custody solutions, and wallet recovery options are essential for crypto’s mass adoption. A Step Toward Mass Adoption By allowing direct CEX-to-DEX trading, Binance is attempting to answer these concerns and lower the entry barrier for millions of potential users who want to explore decentralized platforms but are discouraged by technical obstacles. The exchange believes that bridging the gap between centralized and decentralized finance is a critical step toward broader crypto adoption. Binance’s new feature aims to create a Web2-like experience in a Web3 world, providing users with the flexibility of decentralized finance without sacrificing the security and simplicity of centralized custody. Binance’s new initiative could set the stage for a new trend where major centralized platforms help onboard retail users into the DeFi ecosystem without the steep learning curve. It could also trigger further competition among exchanges to offer more user-friendly, interoperable services that remove complexity from crypto trading. Moreover, this approach addresses growing regulatory concerns about user protection and security in DeFi by allowing users to interact with decentralized ecosystems without exposing themselves to unnecessary bridging risks. Uniswap’s US App Store Ranking Crashes to Historic Lows Amid Trading Volume Decline Meanwhile, Uniswap, the world’s leading decentralized exchange (DEX), is facing a concerning downtrend in its visibility and user engagement, as evidenced by its dramatic fall in the US App Store rankings. Once riding high on the back of post-election crypto enthusiasm, Uniswap’s finance category ranking has plummeted to levels not seen since its early days, reflecting a deeper decline in both user activity and trading volume. In the aftermath of the 2024 US presidential election, Uniswap's app store ranking experienced a significant boost. Following the surprise victory of pro-crypto candidate Donald Trump, Uniswap jumped from its usual spot in the 190s to the 110s in the finance category of the US App Store. The positive sentiment surrounding Trump's inauguration in January 2025 propelled Uniswap’s app to its highest recorded ranking in recent memory — peaking at rank 99. However, this spike proved to be short-lived. Over the past two months, Uniswap’s app store position has deteriorated rapidly, falling to rank 364, a dramatic drop that not only erased its post-election gains but also pushed it to its lowest ranking in recent history. While many crypto-related apps experienced temporary increases in popularity following the pro-crypto election victory, most of them eventually reverted to their pre-election standings. Uniswap, however, is an outlier, with its ranking falling well below historic norms, suggesting more than just the fading of election-related hype. The declining App Store ranking appears to be a symptom of a broader slowdown in Uniswap’s ecosystem. Since the start of 2025, Uniswap’s trader activity on the Ethereum network has suffered a sharp decline. The number of unique traders has fallen by over 45%, from 69,680 at the beginning of January to around 37,000 in March — a level not seen since July 2023. This exodus of users has been mirrored in trading volume as well. Uniswap recorded a 10% drop in trading volume from December 2024 to January 2025. This decline steepened further with a 22% month-over-month drop from January to February. Early data for March suggests that the downtrend is continuing. With just days left in the month, Uniswap’s trading volume is currently barely surpassing half of February’s total, setting the stage for potentially its worst monthly performance in nearly two years. What’s Behind Uniswap’s Decline? Several factors may be contributing to Uniswap’s struggles. While the brief election-fueled optimism initially drove user engagement, the crypto market has since cooled as regulatory uncertainty and economic concerns returned to the forefront. Uniswap's decentralized model, while celebrated by crypto purists, has also been at odds with the growing demand for more streamlined and user-friendly experiences offered by centralized platforms. Additionally, Uniswap continues to face intense competition from both emerging decentralized exchanges and established centralized players who are increasingly integrating DeFi services into their platforms. Binance’s recent rollout of CEX-to-DEX trading integration, for example, offers an easier onboarding process for retail users looking to explore decentralized markets — a market segment where Uniswap has historically struggled to compete. The decline in Uniswap’s app store ranking may also signal waning interest from casual retail investors, many of whom were drawn to crypto during the 2021 bull run but have since exited the market amid prolonged volatility and lackluster price performance in the DeFi sector. For Uniswap, the steep fall in user activity and app visibility raises urgent questions about its ability to maintain relevance and competitiveness in a rapidly evolving crypto landscape. The DEX pioneered the concept of automated market making (AMM) and decentralized liquidity pools, but these innovations alone may no longer be enough to attract and retain users amid shifting market dynamics and evolving user expectations. With March’s trading data poised to mark another month of contraction, the pressure is now on Uniswap’s development team and community to address the platform’s sliding momentum. Whether through product innovation, user experience enhancements, or renewed marketing efforts, Uniswap may need to reimagine how it engages with a broader audience if it hopes to reverse its current trajectory.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|UNI|BNB|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-03-31 09:30:00

According to Cointelegraph, former U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed 25% tariffs and shifting expectations regarding Federal Reserve interest rate cuts have rattled risk traders, intensifying bearish sentiment across the cryptocurrency market. Trump’s Tariff Plans and Market Reaction The cryptocurrency market, particularly risk-sensitive assets like XRP, has been under pressure following reports that Trump, if re-elected, intends to impose 25% tariffs on imports from China and other trading partners. UPDATE: $XRP price could drop another 40% as President Trump’s 25% tariffs and falling rate cut odds spook risk traders. pic.twitter.com/YsKe4k1ilE — Cointelegraph (@Cointelegraph) March 31, 2025 Historically, trade tariffs lead to market instability, increasing the cost of goods and services, while simultaneously reducing economic growth. For risk assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies, such policies create an atmosphere of uncertainty, prompting investors to move toward safer assets such as gold, bonds, and the U.S. dollar. With XRP already experiencing volatility, traders now fear that a potential trade war scenario under Trump could dampen investor sentiment further, leading to an extended period of price declines. The Federal Reserve’s Role in XRP’s Outlook Another key factor weighing on XRP’s price trajectory is the diminishing likelihood of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2024. Lower interest rates typically boost risk assets, as they make borrowing cheaper and increase liquidity in financial markets. However, if inflation remains stubbornly high, the Fed may delay or reduce the number of expected rate cuts, leading to lower demand for risk assets like XRP and other cryptocurrencies. Recent macroeconomic data suggests that the Fed may hold off on rate cuts longer than expected, reinforcing bearish pressure on the crypto market. Combined with Trump’s potential trade policies, this could contribute to further downward movement for XRP. XRP’s Technical Setup: More Losses Ahead? From a technical perspective, XRP’s price action is showing signs of weakness . The coin has already struggled to maintain key support levels, and analysts warn that a further 40% drop could materialize if market conditions worsen. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Support Levels to Watch: XRP is currently testing critical support levels, and a break below these zones could accelerate selling pressure. If the coin fails to hold its recent lows, traders may expect a further move toward lower psychological levels. Investor Sentiment Remains Bearish: The combination of macroeconomic uncertainty, Trump’s trade policy risks, and weaker liquidity conditions suggests that buyers are hesitant to step in at current prices. This could lead to further downside pressure in the coming weeks. What’s Next for XRP? While short-term sentiment remains bearish, long-term investors may see any deep correction as a buying opportunity. Historically, XRP has recovered from major downturns, often rebounding when market conditions stabilize. However, in the immediate future, risk traders are closely watching both Trump’s policy developments and the Federal Reserve’s stance on interest rates. Any unexpected changes in these areas could further impact XRP’s trajectory. For now, investors should remain cautious, as volatility remains high, and downside risks persist.

Whales offloaded 1.12 billion $XRP in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/DlxE1v1NI5 — Ali (@ali_charts) March 30, 2025 For additional context, at present, XRP whales continue to hold roughly 8.88 billion tokens, down from 10 billion before the latest round of liquidations. This latest development presents quite a bearish signal all on its own. Similar large-scale sell-offs have previously signalled either the beginning of wide-scale profit-taking or major shifts in investor sentiment. However, this time around, the liquidations could have an even more impactful effect on the cryptocurrency’s shorter-term price action — and it’s due to timing. Per Ripple’s escrow schedule, 1 billion XRP tokens will be unlocked on April 1 . Since the start of the year, Ripple has sold more than 900 million tokens through three equal transactions, valued at a grand total of $2.1 billion. In conjunction with the whale sell-off, a similar move could serve to push XRP prices further to the downside. Will the whale sell-off cause XRP prices to drop? At press time on March 31, XRP was changing hands at a price of $2.07, having marked a 15.59% drop in the last seven days. Quite notably, the decline in price happened on strong volume, indicating that significant selling pressure is present. XRP price 1-week chart. Source: CoinMarketCap While XRP did lose $7 billion in market capitalization over the course of the two days in which whales went on a selling spree, readers should note that this was part of a broader market pullback . So, what now? The $2 mark represents both a psychologically significant level as well as key technical support. Most technical analysts remain bullish regarding the token’s long-term prospects , but near-term price action is in a much more precarious position Veteran trader Peter Brandt is one of the few analysts who sees further losses in the cards — projecting a drop to levels as low as $1 , according to a recently spotted head and shoulders pattern . In addition, once the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) finally signs off on lifting the injunction that prevents the sale of XRP to institutional investors, market sentiments might very well change. Once all is said and done, however, unless market-wide sentiments see a dramatic shift in short order, XRP will most likely fall below $2 — although it remains to be seen whether the drop will continue or if a strong level of demand will be established at that price.

While Bitcoin (BTC) struggles to gain momentum, savvy investors are turning their attention elsewhere. A few standout altcoins are already catching attention. Toncoin (TON), FloppyPepe (FPPE) , and Cardano (ADA) are making waves, and for good reason. These three might be worth watching for investors looking for the next big opportunity after the US Bitcoin Reserve. FloppyPepe (FPPE): The Best Altcoin To Buy After The US Bitcoin Reserve Announcement Investors are no longer chasing hype; they want real-value crypto projects. Many altcoins have surged in price only to fizzle out due to a lack of sustainability. But with AI taking over the market, newer tokens are rewriting the game. FloppyPepe (FPPE) isn’t just riding the trend; it’s surpassing projects that came before it. The real question is: Why should investors pay attention in 2025, even after the US Bitcoin Reserve? The tokenomics is built for long-term growth, regardless of market conditions. While most projects create excessive tokens and rely on occasional burns to control liquidity, FloppyPepe (FPPE) takes a smarter approach, automatically burning 1% of every transaction. This creates a constantly shrinking supply, driving scarcity and value. Beyond that, demand is exploding. The community’s excitement has fueled a rush to grab the limited tokens, and once they’re gone, prices could skyrocket. But the benefits don’t stop there; holders earn passive rewards, too, with another 1% of every transaction redistributed back to them. So, what's powering this project? FloppyAI. This advanced AI transforms how investors interact with crypto. It processes real-time market data , user queries, and on-chain insights through machine learning, offering instant alerts, trade execution, and continuous adaptation to market trends. But the real magic? Two AI-driven meme creators: Meme-O-Matic and FloppyX. FloppyX makes video creation easy and delivers high-quality and relevant video content. Meanwhile, Meme-O-Matic takes even the simplest ideas and turns them into viral sensations, dominating the internet. These two tools are available on Telegram, X, and the FloppyPepe (FPPE) website. FloppyPepe (FPPE) goes the extra mile to solidify its credibility by securing a security audit from Solidproof . Toncoin (TON) Since the release of Durov, Toncoin (TON) has seen consistent price movements. This surge in investors’ confidence has driven the Toncoin price from $2.39 to $3.79, marking an impressive 58% increase this month. Recently, the TON Foundation announced that leading U.S.-based venture capital firms have invested over $400 million in Toncoin (TON), signaling strong institutional confidence. Additionally, native accounts surged to 41M, while Toncoin (TON) holders have surpassed $121M. This rapid adoption highlights the increasing adoption of Toncoin (TON) even as the US Bitcoin Reserve has failed to pump the BTC price higher. Cardano (ADA) Cardano’s price movement is influenced by technological advancements, network upgrades, and smart contract adoptions. While the US Bitcoin Reserve announcement has failed to lift Bitcoin’s price, Cardano (ADA) has defied the trend, gaining momentum as whale investors accumulate millions of Cardano (ADA) tokens. Adding to the bullish sentiment, crypto analyst Ali recently highlighted on X that Cardano (ADA) had received a buy signal from the TD Sequential indicator on the 4-hour chart. This technical setup suggests that a rebound could be imminent, fueling optimism among traders and investors who see Cardano (ADA) as an altcoin to buy in 2025. Looking Ahead After the US Bitcoin Reserve announcement, analysts are pointing to the upcoming altcoin season. But the real question isn’t just when; it’s which altcoins are worth betting on. Toncoin (TON) and Cardano (ADA) have strong momentum, but when it comes to real utility, which is the main driving force of any coin, FloppyPepe (FPPE) stands out to deliver the most. With a rapidly growing community and solid fundamentals, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioned to outshine other altcoins in the market. But knowing is only half the battle; timing matters, and those who move early often see the greatest rewards. The token is already out for $0.0000002, marking the beginning of what could be a major breakout.

42690248,https://timestabloid.com/?p=62328,1743413786,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions Explained: Beginner’s Guide,https://timestabloid.com/ethereum-layer-2-solutions-explained-beginners-guide/,"Ethereum introduced smart contracts and dApps in the blockchain ecosystem, and it’s been the leading player in this field. But, as adoption grew, it was clear that Ethereum couldn’t handle as many transactions as it needed with its throughput of around 14 transactions per second. During higher demand, gas fees rose, and settlement times became increasingly long. There are many improvement proposals, and developers introduced a series of upgrades to solve this issue. However, the current consensus is that Layer-2 protocols are the solution to Ethereum’s scalability problem. If you want to swap BTC to ETH and participate in the Ethereum ecosystem, you should learn about Layer-2 solutions. Layer-2 projects operate as a second blockchain on top of Ethereum. They process transactions off-chain and then settle the final result on the main chain. This improves transaction times and costs but maintains Ethereum’s security and decentralization. Ethereum Layer-2 Solutions: Types and Overview Layer 2 is an umbrella term to encompass different technologies, including rollups, sidechains, or state channels. Layer 2 helps scale Ethereum by loading off transaction processing from the main chain while maintaining its security infrastructure. Rollups bundle transactions to process them off-chain and add the resulting data to Ethereum. Rollups can be zero-knowledge or optimistic, depending on how to approach verification. State channels allow the parties involved to deposit the funds in a smart contract, and they can make as many transactions as they want on it. Only the final result is settled on the main chain. Funds are locked in a multisig smart contract. Plasma chains act as child chains from Ethereum. They can be customized to serve specific purposes, like for businesses or communities. Settlement on the main network takes a few days, to avoid the risk of fake transactions. Validium ensures transaction validity with ZK proofs keeping data on-chain. Ethereum Layer-2 vs. Layer-1: What’s the Difference? To understand Layer-2 solutions, it’s important to learn what sets them apart from Layer-1. Simply put, Layer-1 refers to the main Ethereum chain we all know and use. With the rise of NFT and DeFi, the network struggled with congestion. ETH ETF is now putting more buying pressure on Ethereum, although ETF traders don’t interact directly with the token. Layer-2 protocols run on top of this main chain and benefit from Ethereum’s security and decentralization (because transactions are ultimately settled there). However, since they don’t operate directly on Ethereum, Layer-2 chains are not bound by its limitations. Therefore, they can process more transactions per second, lowering time to finality and fees. Top 3 Benefits of Using Ethereum Layer-2 Most Ethereum developers agree that instead of upgrading the main chain to achieve higher throughput, it’s best to operate Layer-2 chains to scale Ethereum. There are many available options, and core Ethereum developers believe this can benefit scalability as a whole. The more alternatives in the market, the more options for traders and dApps. In the end, the different Layer-2 chains serve the myriad of DeFi protocols and NFT marketplaces that keep processing thousands of transactions daily. Let’s expand more on the benefits of using Layer-2 solutions. Lower Transaction Fees On the main chain, transaction fees are around $1. Sometimes, when demand increases, it can go over $10. Some Layer-2 chains offer fees as low as $0.04-$0.15. This still represents 85% less than the average Ethereum transaction. While other Ethereum alternatives feature much lower fees, it usually comes at the risk of centralization or network stability. Networks can’t achieve scalability, security, and decentralization at the same time — the so-called blockchain Trilemma. In all cases, projects must sacrifice one of these aspects. For Ethereum developers, while this chain sacrifices scalability, it solves the problem with Layer-2. Faster Transactions In DeFi protocols, and trading in general, timing is key. A couple of seconds can make the difference between a good trade and a great one. The main Ethereum chain takes around 15 seconds to validate transactions. Layer-2 chains can reach near-instant transaction times. Settlement on the main chain, of course, can take days, but it will not affect your balance if all transactions are legitimate. Considering there are over $47 billion locked in DeFi smart contracts in Ethereum, it’s clear that we need solutions to provide instant transactions and higher throughputs. https://www.pexels.com/es-es/foto/moneda-en-mano-del-mercado-de-valores-de-criptomonedas-31220975/ Increased Scalability The scalability is, along with transaction speed, a crucial feature for DeFi and NFT marketplaces. Layer-2 solutions offer varying throughput values, depending on the particular characteristics of each. But in general, they can process over 1,000 tps. Arbitrum, an Optimistic Rollup, can process up to 40 thousand tps, with average fees of around 2 cents. ImmutableX, a rollup using the ZK model, can process around 9 thousand tps. This throughput is achieved without compromising security or decentralization because all transactions are ultimately settled on the Ethereum blockchain. Investing in Ethereum: What Beginners Should Know If you’re new to the Ethereum ecosystem, so many chains and protocols can scare you away. However, the different Layer-2 solutions are worth exploring to understand their values and risks. This sector of blockchain is still evolving, and as a new investor, it can be profitable to learn the most reputable Layer-2 projects. After you buy Ethereum , these other tokens and chains can be worthy additions to your portfolio as long as you acknowledge their pros and cons.

Scams such as address poisoning and wallet spoofing involve tricking victims into sending assets to fraudulent wallet addresses that closely resemble legitimate ones. According to blockchain investigator ZachXBT, multiple Coinbase-linked wallets have been targeted this month. A screenshot from blockchain explorer Blockchair shows a suspected 400 Bitcoin ( BTC ) theft from a single wallet address. “It is suspected a Coinbase user was scammed yesterday for $34.9M (400.099 BTC),” the investigator wrote in a March 28 Telegram post . “After uncovering this theft I noticed multiple other suspected thefts from Coinbase users in the past two weeks bringing the total stolen this month to $46M+,” he added. Suspected 400 BTC phishing theft victim. Source: Blockchair “We are aware of ZachXTB’s claims and are investigating,” Jaclyn Sales, director of communications at Coinbase, told Cointelegraph, adding: “Coinbase will never call you or ask for your login credentials, API key or two-factor authentication codes. We will also never ask you to transfer funds.” “If someone contacts you claiming to be from Coinbase and requests this information or asks you to transfer assets, do not do it. It is a scam,” she said.

Elliot Chun, a partner at the tech-focused advisory firm Architect Partners, made this bold forecast in a March 28 blog post , citing increasing pressure on treasury managers to explore Bitcoin or risk being seen as outdated. “If you tried it and it worked, you’re a genius. If you tried it and it didn’t work, you at least tried. But if you didn’t try and have no good reason, your job may be at risk,” Chun explained, highlighting the growing sentiment among corporate finance leaders. At present, only two S&P 500 companies—Tesla and Block—hold BTC on their balance sheets. To meet Chun’s projection, at least 123 additional S&P 500 firms would need to follow suit by 2030. Meanwhile, MicroStrategy (MSTR), although not part of the S&P 500, continues to dominate as the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with its aggressive BTC acquisition strategy driving its stock price up over 2,000% since its first BTC purchase in August 2020. This performance far outpaces both Bitcoin itself, which surged 781.1% during the same period, and the S&P 500, which gained 64.8%. FOMO’ed Treasury Managers The potential upside of holding BTC is adding pressure on treasury managers to at least consider the asset. Industry heavyweights like ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood and Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz have predicted that Bitcoin could soar to $500,000 or even $1 million by 2030, making the case for early adoption increasingly compelling. Firms embracing BTC as part of their treasury strategy have also seen a boost in market value. GameStop recently hinted at joining the Bitcoin club, following its $1.3 billion convertible notes offering on March 26, with plans to use part of the funds to buy BTC. Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset Remains Unproven While the strategy is gaining popularity, Chun warned that firms aiming to replicate MicroStrategy’s success could be setting themselves up for disappointment. MSTR’s performance, he noted, was unique due to its early-mover advantage when U.S. asset managers lacked direct exposure to Bitcoin. Still, Chun argued that BTC offers more flexibility as a treasury asset compared to gold. Being digitally transferable and liquid, BTC eliminates the logistical challenges of storing and moving physical assets. The trend has also spurred new financial products, such as the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF , launched earlier this month, which tracks companies with at least 1,000 BTC in their corporate treasuries.

The survey, which polled 5,863 adults over three weeks, also found that uncertainty still remains high. Across all three surveys, at least 40% of respondents indicated uncertainty in holding cryptocurrencies in the future, the HKUST research team stated. At the same time, despite the FTX collapse in November 2022, more respondents still expressed confidence in using regulated exchanges.

While more Hongkongers expressed their interest in buying cryptocurrencies, public understanding of tokenized money appears limited as 72% of respondents said they were unfamiliar with central bank digital currency, followed by 65% for e-HKD, 61% for stablecoins, and 81% for tokenized deposits, the survey showed. Hong Kong has made strides to advance itself into a crypto hub, namely through issuing licenses to crypto exchanges and made it possible for companies to issue tokenized investment products. In August 2024, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority launched a sandbox initiative dubbed “Project Ensemble Sandbox” that is designed to test and refine the use of tokenized money for interbank settlements and transactions involving tokenized assets.

The initiative aims to make American Bitcoin a dominant force in the cryptocurrency mining industry. American Bitcoin was founded with contributions from ASIC miners from Hut 8 in exchange for a majority stake in American Data Centers, a company founded by investors such as Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. The company has since rebranded as American Bitcoin. Under the new structure, all Bitcoin mining operations that were previously part of Hut 8’s IT segment will continue under the American Bitcoin brand. However, these activities will still be reported in Hut 8’s financial statements. Hut 8 will remain the exclusive infrastructure and operations partner for American Bitcoin and will provide stable revenue streams through long-term agreements.

But simply buying Bitcoin is only half the story. Mining it in favorable economic conditions presents a much greater opportunity. We are excited to bring this thesis to life and bring investors into the equation through a platform designed to provide real, tangible participation in Bitcoin’s growth.” *This is not investment advice.

Could this downturn take on a snowball effect and lead to a much more serious crash? Stock market and crypto market in fear Market sentiment is plumbing the bottom over recent weeks. In traditional markets Fear and Greed has dipped into ‘Extreme Fear’ as the S&P 500 fell through major support on Friday, down a huge 2% for the day. In the crypto market things are similar, as the dial in the Fear and Greed Index hovers at a ‘Fear’ reading of 34. With seemingly no end to the Trump strategy of slapping tariffs on friend and foe alike, the markets are just not able to predict what is going to happen as 2025 unfolds, and with uncertainty being the worst possible outlook for markets, the stock market is acting accordingly. S&P 500 falls through support Source: TradingView After looking as though it might have found a bottom at the $5,635 level, the S&P 500 dipped down through this level on Friday, reaching $5,580. With a new weekly candle about to open below the support, this stock market could now fall to the low $5,000 region, and even face the possibility of going all the way back to the $4,800 high set in January 2022. That said, the Stochastic RSI is right at the bottom, and this will likely signal a bounce. It just remains to be seen whether this bounce would be strong enough to take the price back into the ascending channel once more. Gold is acting like the traditional flight to safety Source: TradingView While the S&P 500 breaks down, gold, the traditional flight to safety, has just done a remarkably bullish thing and has broken out of the top of its own ascending channel. With gold making new all-time highs on practically a weekly basis, why is Bitcoin at such a low ebb? Bitcoin falls out of channel on short-term time frame Source: TradingView The 4-hour Bitcoin chart shows the breakdown of the ascending channel , and that the price has descended to the 0.618 Fibonacci at $81,340. The measured move for the breakdown is to $80,200, so this is still a possible downside target. With the stock market likely to open in the red on Monday, it remains to be seen how much further Bitcoin can be dragged down. Bitcoin approaches decision time: bounce or collapse? Source: TradingView The weekly time frame shows how Bitcoin is getting nearer to the important decision point. The price will either fall through the $80,000 horizontal support, and potentially carry on down to $70,000, or it will turn back up and break through the descending trendline. Two very big factors that will help to decide the direction of $BTC is the RSI and the Stochastic RSI. The RSI is displaying the extremely strong support (orange line) at the level of 44.00. If the indicator line falls through this, it will be very consequential. Also, the Stochastic RSI is showing that the indicator lines are possibly beginning to roll over. While not as drastic as the RSI losing that 44.00 structural support level, if the Stochastic RSI crosses back down it will signal further downside momentum.

In a March 31 X post, pseudonymous analyst RJT.WAGMI, with 124K followers, pointed out that Cardano appears to be forming a classic “ABCDE” triangle pattern, a type of consolidation structure often seen before major breakouts. Source: X/RJT_WAGMI In this setup, the price moves in five distinct waves labeled A through E within a tightening range, typically ending with a strong move in one direction. Per the analyst, ADA is currently in the middle of the C wave, a downward leg, but once it completes the D and E waves, a strong breakout to the upside could follow. RJT added that a bounce from the 0.5–0.618 Fibonacci retracement zone could serve as the launchpad for a move toward $1.5. “This is where OGs buy,” he noted, implying that experienced traders tend to accumulate when this pattern forms. You might also like: Cardano price could surge to $2 as whale purchases rise Fellow analyst CW echoed a similar sentiment. He noted that ADA was respecting its long-term trend and was hovering near the lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle pattern, a classic consolidation setup where price compresses between converging trend lines. Per the analyst, once ADA breaks above the convergence zone, there’s little to no resistance until $1.9. “Everything will start in an instant,” he wrote, pointing out continued net buying as a bullish sign. According to CoinGlass data, investors have mostly been accumulating the altcoin, with net outflows showing up on most days since March 3. This means more tokens are being taken off exchanges than added, a sign of strong investor belief in its long-term potential. Source: CoinGlass Adding another layer to the bullish case, analyst Master Kenobi compared ADA’s current price action to its behavior in August–September 2024. Back then, the token saw a strong rally after it went through a lengthy consolidation period. With ADA not posting a new low following its Feb. 3 dip to $0.49, just like in the previous cycle, he believes a similar breakout could unfold in May, potentially pushing the price as high as $2.5. However, at presstime, ADA was still under bearish pressure, with its price down 6.2% over the past day at $0.64 while its market cap stood at $23.3 billion. ADA technical analysis On the 1-day/USDT price chart, the 50-day moving average stood above the 200-day moving average, a bullish setup that signals ongoing sustained momentum and strengthens the case for a potential breakout. ADA price, 50-day and 200-day SMA — March 31 | Source: crypto.news The Supertrend indicator has fallen below the price level and has turned green, another sign of a potential reversal in trend soon. ADA Supertrend and RSI chart — March 31 | Source: crypto.news Its Relative Strength Index, dropping to $3,9, looks primed to hit the oversold levels soon, which could encourage bulls to step in and push the price higher. Meanwhile, ADA’s MVRV Z-score has dropped to 0.0077 — its lowest since early March — indicating that the average holder is nearing breakeven. This level often marks a point where selling pressure eases and accumulation begins, increasing the likelihood of a price rebound if market sentiment shifts. However, looking at data from IntoTheBlock, ADA’s price correlation with Bitcoin at press time stood at 0.79, indicating a strong positive relationship over the past 30 days. This means that ADA’s next move would hinge on Bitcoin, which has been on a downtrend ahead of President Donald Trump’s U.S. reciprocal tariffs .

33767162,[object Object],1743415239,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin Market Headwinds To Continue? Short-Term Holder SOPR Remain In Negative Territory,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sths-sopr-negative/,"The previous week was quite interesting for Bitcoin as it recovered the $88,000 mark but faced significant resistance at this level, leading to a pullback near $81,000. During this movement, BTC saw notable selling pressure from investors who sold their holdings at a loss. Persistent Negative Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Bitcoin’s bearish pressure is intensifying as it struggles within the $83,000 and $82,500 price range after a drop from the $88,000 level. Thus far, Short-term holders seem to be taking the ongoing volatility in the market harder than long-term holders. A recent research shared by on-chain and technical expert Darkfost on X (formerly Twitter) has outlined a persistent trend among short-term Bitcoin holders. Darkfost revealed the trend after delving into the Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) Multiples metric, which compares the realized selling price with the original purchase price. This development indicates that short-term holders are still realizing losses on their BTC holdings. According to the on-chain expert, the key metric has stayed within the negative territory for over 2 months. Data from the metric shows that the short-term holder SOPR is currently fluctuating around the 0.98 level, which implies that these investors are offloading their coins at a loss. The persistent negative SOPR trend reflects a challenging market environment where weak hands continue to give up while long-term holders await signs of renewed strength in Bitcoin’s price action. Typically, when the ratio falls below level 1, it suggests that short-term holders are capitulating, which frequently results in brief price reductions. With BTC’s price struggling to recover, the bearish movement is likely to extend as the SOPR indicator continues to show weakness. Specifically, the trend was determined by observing the amount of BTC being sent to crypto exchanges at a loss. Presently, about 46,000 BTC has been transferred to crypto exchanges to be sold at a loss, reflecting low confidence among investors. Darkfost highlighted that these developments are blatant indicators that the market will be challenging in the short term. Short-Term BTC Holders In Loss During the recent correction, short-term holders accumulated significant losses . World-leading on-chain data and financial platform Glassnode reported that the overall loss realization in the Bitcoin market was recorded among these investors, often classified as holders of less than 155 days. While these holders witnessed substantial losses, long-term holders , usually those holding BTC for at least 155 days, remain in profit. However, the long-term holders are the major cause of profit-taking. Data shows that the losses incurred by short-term holders of BTC are now almost equal to the profits taken by long-term holders. This return to a neutral zone indicates a slowdown in profit-taking resistance, a stagnation in capital inflows, and a decline in demand.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|Bitcoin Long-Term Holders|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders|Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Spent Output Profit Ratio|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|Darkfost|Glassnode|sopr,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD|CAKE|PEOPLE|NOT,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-31 10:00:39
42690997,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=721047,1743415242,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/42690997.jpeg,XRP Bull Cycle Could End If This Happens: Analyst,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-bull-cycle-could-end-if-this-happens/,"XRP’s multi-month uptrend may be approaching a critical inflection point, according to technical analyst Josh Olszewicz, known online as @CarpeNoctom. In a chart published on X, Olszewicz highlighted a well-defined bearish reversal pattern, warning that a breakdown could trigger significant downside movement. “I’d be shocked if this actually breaks higher,” the analyst wrote, adding in a livestream that the structure “continues to be the only thing I care about on this chart.” Could This Be The End Of The XRP Bull Cycle? His central thesis is built on a classic head and shoulders pattern, a formation widely recognized by traders as a precursor to a major trend reversal. The chart, based on the XRP/USD daily timeframe, reveals a symmetrical triple-peak structure that fits the textbook definition of a head and shoulders pattern. The left shoulder formed between early and mid-December 2024, topping out near the $2.90 level. This was followed by a higher high in mid-January 2025, when XRP briefly surged to approximately $3.40, forming the head. Subsequently, the right shoulder developed throughout mid-February and March 2025 with a lower high, around the $3.00 region. Related Reading: XRP Price Fate Hangs on $2.00—Major Move Incoming? The neckline — a critical horizontal support level that connects the swing lows between the shoulders — is drawn precisely at the $2.00 mark. This level is not only a psychological round number but also structurally significant, having acted as support multiple times since December last year. Overlaying the pattern is the Ichimoku Cloud indicator. The Ichimoku metrics currently reinforce the bearish outlook. XRP is trading beneath both the Tenkan-sen (conversion line) at $2.2462 and the Kijun-sen (base line) at $2.4528 — both of which are flatlining, indicating a loss of upward momentum. The Senkou Span A (leading span A), currently at $2.4836, and Senkou Span B at $1.9460 form a cloud that is thick, flat, and bearish. Price action is consolidating within the cloud, but the cloud ahead turns red, forecasting resistance and trend weakness in the sessions to come. Related Reading: XRP Price Eyes 20% Move With Golden Pocket Appearance Olszewicz stated unequivocally in his livestream that if the pattern confirms with a breakdown, “you’d be expecting $1.13 to $1.40” as a measured move target. This range represents the potential depth of the head and shoulders formation — calculated by subtracting the height from the head ($3.40) to the neckline ($2.10), which gives approximately $1.30 of projected downside. When subtracted from the neckline level, this yields targets between $1.10 and $1.40, depending on volatility and order book depth. He added, “There is not an impossibility that this just rolls over the entirety of the move. Now that would be end-of-cycle stuff. That would be a bearish legacy, bearish everything — right? But that is in the cards here. You can’t say it’s not until we’re back above $2.85.” With that, Olszewicz clearly defined $2.85 as the invalidation level for this bearish thesis. Notably, this level marks the last significant lower high before price began to roll over — and it coincides with the top of the right shoulder. A close above that point would invalidate the head and shoulders formation and likely suggest a continuation of the bullish cycle. Until then, however, the risk remains tilted to the downside. At press time, XRP traded at $2.07.

Among the hardest-hit segments are meme coins, which have seen sharp pullbacks in recent days. Dogecoin, the original and most recognized meme token, continues to follow a persistent bearish trend — one that may not reverse unless current levels hold firm. Related Reading: Ethereum Analyst Eyes $1,200-$1,300 Level As Potential Acquisition Zone – Details Investor sentiment across the space remains cautious, with rising macroeconomic uncertainty and weakening momentum dragging prices lower. For Dogecoin, this moment is especially critical, as its price action now hovers just above the lower boundary of a long-term parallel channel. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared technical insights revealing that Dogecoin is still holding above this crucial support level. According to Martinez, a spike in demand from this zone could act as the launchpad for a rally toward the mid or upper range of the channel — potentially offering much-needed relief for DOGE holders. While broader market conditions remain fragile, Dogecoin’s structure suggests it still has room to rebound — but only if buyers step in soon. As price compresses near support, the next move could define the token’s short-term trend in a market filled with uncertainty. Dogecoin Down 66% As Market Uncertainty Weighs On Sentiment Dogecoin is currently trading under heavy pressure, down approximately 66% from its multi-year high near $0.48. Despite brief attempts at recovery, underwhelming price action and bearish sentiment continue to drag DOGE lower, with bulls struggling to find momentum in an increasingly volatile market. The broader macroeconomic backdrop isn’t helping either — rising interest rates, geopolitical instability, and trade war tensions have all contributed to a high-risk environment across global financial markets. This turbulence is having an outsized impact on speculative assets, and meme coins like Dogecoin remain some of the most vulnerable. The current conditions suggest that heightened volatility may become the new norm for the foreseeable future, increasing the risk of further downside for DOGE unless strong support holds. Martinez’s technical outlook on X notes that the $0.15 level is now essential for Dogecoin bulls. According to his analysis, DOGE continues to trade just above the lower boundary of a long-term bullish channel — a structure that has held firm through multiple market cycles. Martinez emphasizes that a spike in demand at this level could trigger a sharp rally, potentially pushing DOGE toward the mid or upper range of the channel, between $4 and $7. While this may seem ambitious given current sentiment, the long-term setup remains technically intact — but bulls must step in now to avoid a complete breakdown. Related Reading: Ethereum MVRV Ratio Nears 160-Day MA Crossover – Accumulation Trend Ahead? DOGE Bears Push Bulls to the Edge Dogecoin is trading at $0.16 after facing intense selling pressure over the past several days, dropping more than 20% in under a week. The sharp decline has placed bulls in a difficult position, with momentum clearly favoring the bears. The price structure remains decisively bearish, and if DOGE fails to hold the critical $0.15 support level, a dramatic collapse could follow — potentially sending the meme coin into lower demand zones not seen in months. The $0.15 mark now stands as the last line of defense for bulls, as it aligns with a key long-term support level within a broader bullish channel. Losing it would likely trigger panic selling and confirm a breakdown in market structure. However, if Dogecoin can maintain support above $0.16 and attract renewed buying interest, there’s still potential for a short-term recovery. A bounce from current levels could spark a rally toward the $0.20–$0.25 range — a zone that previously acted as strong resistance and may offer the first real test of any upward momentum.

The analyst is optimistic that Bitcoin price might flip the $100,000 psychological level and explode to $101,000. Peter Brandt Flips His Bearish Bitcoin Price Forecast to Bullish Bitcoin price today trades at $82,100 with a 1.5% decline in 24 hours and a daily low of $81,362. The downtrend comes amid a massive capital outflow from risk assets after President Trump noted that the reciprocal tariff push would apply to all countries. However, despite the bearish headwinds, Peter Brandt has opined that the BTC price might be on the verge of a trend reversal. In his analysis, Brandt identified a head and shoulders pattern that hints towards an uptrend. Bitcoin Price Chart Nevertheless, Brandt remained skeptical about the reliability of the pattern due to the sloping necklines. He stated that an inverse head and shoulders pattern with a horizontal neckline was “far more reliable.” While responding to Brandt’s analysis on X, Nat Robbins shared an even higher price target noting that Bitcoin will reach $135,000 . He said, “I think this is just a retest of the neckline of the largest inverse H&S pattern. The target is still $135,000. I see no reason why this latest and largest one won’t meet its target.” Despite the bullish forecast, several signs indicate that the Bitcoin bull run might be over. On-chain Data Shows Mixed Signals on Bitcoin On-chain data makes a bearish case for Bitcoin price and indicates that there is a risk for more downside. Data from CryptoQuant shows that the 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) has formed a death cross after crossing below the 365-day MVRV. Per analyst Yonsei, this crossover suggests that the short-term momentum has weakened, increasing the risk of the downward pressure. More importantly, the analyst noted that there was no sign that the bottom was in yet, further highlighting a bearish Bitcoin price prediction . BTC MVRV Ratio However, despite the MVRV showing a heightened risk of further downward pressure on the price of Bitcoin, exchange supply data indicates that some traders are moving their Bitcoin from exchanges, which leans towards accumulation. Popular analyst Ali Charts noted that in the last week, more than 30,000 BTC has left exchanges . This hints that the recent dip may have pushed Bitcoin to an accumulation zone. As analyst predictions and on-chain data show a mixed market sentiment, BTC traders should watch out for the price defending the $80,000 support level. If Bitcoin manages to hold above this zone, it could fulfill the bullish price forecast. Conversely, if BTC drops below $80,000 , it might cause more panic selling.

This week, one coin in particular has captured the market’s attention— $MOVE . The Movement Network’s native token is currently trending on CoinGecko, and it looks like a surge of interest and activity has pushed it to the head of the cryptocurrency pack. Following closely behind are two other coins that have been part of the week’s discussions: $NIL, the token of the Nillion Network, and $SUI, which represents the Sui Network. These coins not only are gaining market attention but also are tied to some pretty significant events that could impact the broader crypto ecosystem. Movement Network Foundation to launch 38M $USDT buyback of $MOVE tokens The Movement Network Foundation announced on its website that following a notification from Binance about an ongoing investigation involving a market maker (MM) and various tokens, including MOVE, the… — CoinNess Global (@CoinnessGL) March 25, 2025 Movement Network’s Major Deposit Sparks Curiosity This week, $MOVE has become the most popular coin, and it’s easy to see why. A huge move took place just a few hours ago when a Movement Treasury address sent a jaw-dropping 7 million $MOVE tokens to Coinbase. We are talking about a transfer here worth $3.3 million. Now, huge transfers are always worth mentioning, but when they involve a coin that’s trending, it doubles the interest, in my opinion. This deposit is made all the more interesting by the interaction it reveals between the Movement Treasury and a well-known market participant. The address linked to the deposit has a history of dealing with Flow Traders, a prominent market maker. The connection raises the prospect that this transaction might involve Flow Traders or some other market maker, though it isn’t clear at the moment if that’s the case. Market makers are really important players in the crypto scene, often responsible for providing liquidity, and the better their scene is, the more room there is for making it work and for making it stable. This event, while drawing notice, is also part of a larger strategic play by the Movement Network Foundation. According to the foundation’s official website, they have announced plans to use any funds they might recover from an ongoing investigation into Binance Binance and certain of its business practices, notably those that pertain to a market maker and various tokens, including $MOVE. The Movement Network has made it clear that any such funds will be used to bolster the Movement ecosystem. Top 20 Trending Coins on CoinGecko This week, $MOVE ( @movementlabsxyz ) leads the pack, followed by $NIL ( @nillionnetwork ) in second place, and $SUI ( @SuiNetwork ) in third. Are you keeping an eye on these? https://t.co/wR2b6z7a17 pic.twitter.com/ZXMHokcXZF — CoinGecko (@coingecko) March 28, 2025 Movement Network’s Strategic Reserve Plans What this means, in short, is that the Movement Network Foundation is developing a reserve of $MOVE tokens. The way they are going about it is quite interesting. They have a very detailed program that covers not just this buyback initiative but also the overall strategy and vision for the token. The $MOVE token is an essential component of the foundation’s market design. It is crucial for the foundation and these tokens to be liquid and stable in the market. Ilan Lobel from the foundation has penned a detailed outline of the buyback and reserve initiative. The Movement Strategic Reserve is a proactive step in the right direction to provide stability to the token and ensure its continued growth. For the crypto community, this is not a series of moves focused on short-term gains. Instead, the Movement Network seems intent on securing long-term success for $MOVE and its broader ecosystem. Other Trending Coins: $NIL and $SUI Certainly, $MOVE is this week’s highlight, but we must recognize the other two coins that are making waves. $NIL, the token of the Nillion Network, sits at No. 2 on CoinGecko’s trending list. Nillion is a privacy and decentralized computing project, one that could seriously shake up the current blockchain landscape. Why? Because the demand for privacy solutions isn’t going down; in fact, it’s going up. And with that rising tide, $NIL is emerging as a token to watch. Occupying the third position is $SUI, which is associated with the Sui Network. Sui is an efficient blockchain that is purposefully built for Web3. The core offerings of Sui are speed and scalability. Not only is Sui designed to be a new DeFi powerhouse, but it is also a friendly environment for NFTs and smart contracts. Conclusion: A Week of Movement and Strategy The cryptocurrency world had an especially notable week, with a large influx of tokens directed toward Coinbase that caught the attention of observers. This was not just any old deposit, though; it was a substantial transfer of $MOVE tokens that seemed to signal something important for the token’s nascent project. By the end of the week, we had some idea what that might be, as the project associated with $MOVE, called the Movement Project, unveiled some ambitious plans. The Movement Network is clearly moving, and with a strategic plan in place and the evolution of blockchain technologies, might have a lasting impact on the crypto market. Investors and enthusiasts will keep a close eye on the developments this week. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

On Wednesday, March 26, the upswing abruptly ended, and trading between Thursday and Friday proved particularly damaging. Digital assets erased more than $100 billion within a single day. Furthermore, weekend movements quashed any hopes of a swift positive correction. Indeed, between Friday and Monday, the total cryptocurrency market capitalization plunged another $110 billion, with the 24 hours leading to the morning of March 31 alone erasing nearly $38 billion. Total cryptocurrency market cap one-week price chart. Source: TradingView The relative shock of the turn – and the sentiment driving the preceding climb – can be gauged based on the community ‘ideas’ Finbold retrieved from TradingView on March 31. Crypto community weighs in on the market crash Specifically, most recent cryptocurrency market cap chart analyses paint a bullish picture, though there have been several bears as well. VictoriaCobra , a popular analyst on the platform, posted a rather grim estimate that ‘the good crypto narrative is over.’ The community expert pointed to a set of factors backing the idea that the current cycle is out of opportunities for a true breakout. For example, they pointed out that total market capitalization is near the 2021 highs despite the 2024 bull market , while the number of active Bitcoin ( BTC ) addresses is close to the levels seen in 2017. BTC price and active address chart. Source: Glassnode Furthermore, the discrepancy between gold’s and BTC’s performance was highlighted as doing much to undermine the ‘store of value’ argument, while President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s actions have eroded digital assets’ credibility. Lastly, the analyst concluded that despite the activity and the rise in valuation, cryptocurrencies lack a true footprint outside their own ecosystem. Simultaneously, other prolific community experts have been bullish. CryptoNikkoid opined that a ‘storm’ is coming and that it would lead to a strong bull run while pointing out the relative strength index ( RSI ) of digital assets – painting them as oversold – and of the S&P 500 – positioning the index as overbought. The analyst simultaneously pointed out that the dollar index (DXY) has been weakening along with the stocks. Ultimately, the Trading View expert revealed that between the equity outflows and the situation with the DXY, a significant amount of cash has been freed up for the cryptocurrency market. They identified June at the latest as the time the bull market will restart and opined major digital assets, Bitcoin most notably, could double in value. Is the crypto market more bullish or bearish in 2025? Though the possibility of a renewed bull cycle almost always exists, recent trends appear to back the bear cases more strongly. Cryptocurrencies have generally followed the stock market, with even the latest downturn coming mere days after new and adverse data center bubble and tariff news shook the more traditional assets. Furthermore, while many would agree that the S&P 500 turned far more overbought than cryptocurrencies during 2024, money has been steadily flowing out from corporate equity and, unfortunately for blockchain optimists, appears to be fueling ‘legacy’ safe havens like gold far more than other risk assets.

For every 100% SHIB price pump in 2025, this token could skyrocket 1,000%",https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/31/is-shiba-inu-still-a-good-investment-for-every-100-shib-price-pump-in-2025-this-token-could-skyrocket-1000/,"Although Shiba Inu (SHIB) is still a well-liked meme currency, its long-term prospects are called into doubt due to its volatility and crowded market position. In 2025, analysts predict that SHIB’s price might rise by 100%. But another token, Rexas Finance (RXS) , is drawing interest with a novel offer: RXS might rise 10 times for every 2x increase SHIB makes. With RXS already up 580% during its presale and analysts projecting a post-launch worth of $10+, investors are turning their attention elsewhere. Rexas Finance uses tokenisation to enable worldwide fractional ownership by bridging the gap between blockchain technology and physical assets like gold and real estate. Supported by a CertiK audit and featured on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, RXS positions itself as a high-growth option in the cryptocurrency industry by fusing innovation with legitimacy. Rexas Finance redefining real-world asset ownership Investors’ interactions with tangible assets are being revolutionised by Rexas Finance. Access to traditional markets, such as gold and real estate, has long been restricted by money and region, despite their total worth surpassing $30 trillion. By tokenizing assets on the blockchain, Rexas eliminates these obstacles. Consider a student in Nigeria investing in commercial real estate in Dubai or a teacher in Brazil buying a portion of a flat in Tokyo. The platform democratises wealth-building opportunities by enabling users to purchase, sell, or fractionalise assets in a matter of seconds. The ERC-20 token powers a suite of tools designed for seamless asset integration. The Rexas Token Builder lets anyone convert real-world holdings into tradeable tokens, while the Launchpad enables fundraising for new projects. The Quickmint Bot simplifies token creation, and AI-driven tools like GenAI and AI Shield enhance security and user experience. By merging tangible value with blockchain efficiency, Rexas is eliminating the gap between physical assets and digital ownership. RXS presale momentum and strategic tokenomics Rexas Finance has prioritized community growth over venture capital backing, reserving 50% of its 1 billion tokens for public presale. Early stages sold out rapidly, raising $47.1 million of its $56 million target. Stage 12—the final phase—prices RXS at $0.20, a 6.6x jump from its initial $0.03. With 91.2% of presale tokens already claimed, the project is nearing its June 2025 launch, where RXS will debut on exchanges at $0.25. Tokenomics allocate 22.5% to staking rewards, 15% to liquidity, and 10% to treasury reserves, ensuring stability and long-term incentives. A $1 million giveaway has amplified interest, offering 20 winners $50,000 each. Participants submit ERC-20 wallet addresses, complete social tasks, and earn extra entries through referrals. Combined with listings on top-tier exchanges post-launch, Rexas is leveraging visibility and trust to drive adoption. The CertiK-audited smart contracts further reassure investors, addressing security concerns common in decentralized projects. Why Rexas Finance outshines market alternatives While SHIB relies on speculative trading, RXS ties its value to trillion-dollar real-world markets. Tokenized assets generate passive income through rent, dividends, or appreciation, offering utility beyond typical crypto volatility. For example, a $10,000 RXS investment today could grow to $500,000 if the token hits $10, as analysts forecast. This potential stems from Rexas’s first-mover advantage in asset tokenization—a sector projected to expand 1,000% by 2030. Investors entering the presale now secure tokens at $0.20 before the June launch. Historical data shows assets with strong presale performance often surge post-listing. RXS’s presale trajectory mirrors Solana’s early growth, which saw 100x returns within a year. With SHIB’s gains capped by its meme-driven model, RXS offers a calculated entry into a market poised for exponential growth. The verdict on high-potential investments Shiba Inu may deliver short-term gains, but Rexas Finance unlocks transformative wealth-building opportunities. By merging blockchain with real estate, commodities, and art, RXS creates tangible value for global investors. The presale’s final stage offers a narrowing window to buy below the $0.25 launch price. With tier-1 exchange listings, a $1 million giveaway, and AI-powered tools, Rexas is not just keeping pace with the crypto market—it’s redefining it. For those seeking assets with 50x potential, RXS stands as a compelling choice in 2025’s investment landscape.

Content creators have undeniably transformed the internet in recent years. Adult or NSFW content creators, in particular, have seen a rise in popularity and increased demand for personalized fan interactions. You might also like: Redefining trust and ownership in the creator economy | Opinion Platforms such as OnlyFans, Patreon, and Cameo have reshaped traditional boundaries, providing creators with direct lines to their fans and empowering them financially in unprecedented ways. Yet, from my experience as CMO of OnlyFans, I observed a persistent challenge that even the most successful creators face: the struggle to scale genuine connections. For instance, some of our top creators would spend hours each day personally responding to hundreds of fan messages, only to find themselves overwhelmed, exhausted, and still unable to meet fans’ growing expectations. While creators flourish when engagement is authentic and personal, there is inevitably a cap—human limits on time, energy, and availability. Burnout, diminishing returns, and stalled growth become real concerns, particularly as creators become more successful. Historically, some creators have tackled the issue of scalability by outsourcing fan engagement. But this often resulted in diluted authenticity, increased costs, and potential brand damage if interactions weren’t consistent with the creator’s tone of voice. Fans crave authenticity; any compromise risks eroding the fundamental trust underpinning creator-fan relationships. The shift from traditional creator-fan engagement to an AI-enhanced model is like stepping through a portal into a new world—one where past limitations fade away. Artificial intelligence represents a critical turning point in online creator economies. Not as a replacement for human creativity but as a powerful new tool to amplify and sustain it. The real value of AI in the creator economy isn’t just about efficiency; it’s about enabling creators to maintain authenticity at scale, offering personalized experiences without sacrificing intimacy, privacy, or emotional energy. AI to enhance—not replace—human interaction But what does an AI-enhanced creator-fan engagement model actually look like? The short answer is it varies. But one manifestation is creator-owned AI-powered digital representations of real human creators. This model offers continuous, personalized interaction without compromising the human element that fans genuinely seek. These AI personas can faithfully replicate a human creator’s style, tone, and nuances, providing fans with a meaningful sense of connection around the clock. It’s a technology that still allows creators to retain full control over their digital representations, maintaining brand consistency and personal boundaries without the heavy cost or risks involved in traditional outsourcing. Moreover, AI unlocks entirely new creative opportunities beyond traditional messaging. For example, personalized voice notes, bespoke imagery, interactive storytelling, or dynamic experiences tailored to individual fans’ preferences can profoundly deepen fan engagement. Rather than simply mimicking interactions, AI technology—when ethically implemented—empowers creators to explore entirely new forms of digital intimacy and storytelling. Economically, AI democratizes access in a creator economy that has become increasingly exclusive. Previously, personalized engagement with popular creators was typically costly, limiting deeper connections to only those who could afford premium access. AI fundamentally changes these economics, making personalized experiences widely accessible while allowing creators to sustainably grow their income without exhausting themselves. Some fear AI’s growing role risks diluting human authenticity or even replacing creators. But from my perspective and experience in digital content innovation, AI’s role is quite the opposite. Rather than replacing creators, AI augments and amplifies their human potential, allowing them to reach more fans authentically, explore deeper creative opportunities, and avoid burnout from unsustainable demand. The future of the creator economy lies not in choosing between humanity and technology but in integrating them thoughtfully and ethically. Multimodel, agentic AI presents creators and fans alike with a win-win scenario: creators can protect their well-being and creative energy, and unlock infinite scale while more fans gain greater access, more meaningful interactions, and truly personalized experiences. As someone who’s seen the evolution first-hand from traditional digital platforms to emerging frontiers, I believe AI represents a mutually beneficial development in the creator economy. It’s not about replacing human connection but enriching it. We are entering a new era, and it’s one that creators and their fans can equally look forward to enjoying.

Globacap Private Markets Inc, a broker-dealer and alternative trading system (ATS) regulated by FINRA and the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC), is being bought by Archax and being renamed to Archax Markets US. The new entity will serve as the company's foothold on American soil and serve the institutions and professional investors in the country, two Archax executives told CoinDesk. Asset tokenization is a fast-growing sector in crypto as global banks, asset managers and digital asset firms are increasingly using blockchain rails to move traditional financial instruments. They do so to achieve operational efficiencies and speedier,around-the-clock settlements. Just in the past weeks, asset manager Fidelity Investments filed to launch a tokenized money market fund and is reportedly working on issuing a stablecoin . Derivatives exchange CME Group started tokenization tests with Google Cloud with plans to launch new services next year, while the New York Stock Exchange's parent company partnered with Circle to explore services built on USDC stablecoin and tokenized fund USYC. Archax specializes in the issuance, custody, and trading of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), including money market funds, corporate bonds, carbon credits and uranium. For example, Archax's recently-issued tokenized Treasury fund on XRP Ledger with asset manager Abrdn saw $45 million in deposits to become a top 10 product by assets under management, rwa.xyz data shows. Archax has been exploring entering the U.S. market over the past years, but stayed on the sideline due to regulatory uncertainty, Graham Rodford, CEO of Archax, said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""Under this new administration, which seems to be more crypto positive, we are getting more interest from the U.S. as well, which obviously we can't easily serve from the UK, so it makes sense for us strategically to go there,"" Rodford said. Archax also plans to expand its offerings to tokenized U.S. equities and bonds, building on its existing partnerships across several blockchains including Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, Hedera Hashgraph and XRP Ledger. The firm's U.S. entrance follows the recent purchase of a Spanish brokerage firm to expand services to the European Union, pending regulatory approvals.",Finance|Tokenized Assets|Real World Assets|Broker-Dealers|Exclusive|acquisition,EN,0,0,MARKET|EXCHANGE|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-31 11:27:54

However, a new challenger, Mutuum Finance (MUTM), is performing well with its aggressive growth trajectory. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), going through its fourth funding phase while demonstrating rapid growth at a price point of $0.025 and managed to secure nearly $5.8 million from investors. Over 7500 holders have entered the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale during phase 4 due to the system plans to raise its price from $0.025 to $0.03. Those starting to invest now during this phase means investors can earn 140% return at launch price of $0.06. MUTM could hit $4 after launch. A DeFi Powerhouse Gaining Traction Mutuum Finance is transforming the decentralized lending market through its revolutionary dual-lending technology which drives its exponential growth. Approximately 7500 investors have partaken in support of the project by investing $5.8 million after recognizing its value potential during its presale period. The current price of Mutuum Finance Token stands at $0.025 in Phase 4 but investors will experience additional value from the upcoming Phase 5 price increase of 20%. Mutuum Finance brings out the revolutionary change to Defi by incorporating Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2P provides passive income opportunities to customers by placing them in USDT liquidity pools through smart contract managed automatic lending capabilities. The P2P method enables direct lending relations that allow customers to operate deals without intermediaries while keeping their capital intact. The linkage of P2C and P2P models at Mutuum Finance creates an investment opportunity with enhanced safety alongside improved efficiency and decentralized features as a DeFi investment solution for maximum-yield seekers. A Secure and Trustworthy Financial Ecosystem Mutuum Finance plans to construct a completely collateralized stablecoin backed by USD fixed within the Ethereum blockchain to support its entire ecosystem. This cryptocurrency exceeds algorithmic stablecoins’ requirements by using extra collateral thus reducing both the risks and maintaining stability over time. Such an approach provides complete investor confidence because it combines open financial architecture with audited smart contracts while avoiding the failures that devastated other DeFi projects. The company builds its community base through rewarding investors with attractive benefits. The fund will send 10 fortunate participants $10,000 worth of Mutuum Finance tokens through its million-dollar token distribution campaign combined with its award-winning referral system that rewards users for acquiring new participants. The platform offers exclusive staking pools and governance rights and VIP update access to its early adopting community members as they develop long-term loyalty with Mutuum Finance. Sustainable Tokenomics for Long-Term Growth The tokenomics system of this project uses mechanisms which control token release and promote price stability for the long-term. Scarcity of tokens and deflationary mechanisms applied during presales lead Mutuum Finance to establish price appreciation potential in the long term. High incentive rewards and active token participation are possible through its staking feature which builds long-term functionality and maintains a healthy ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioning itself as a strong competitor to Cardano (ADA) with its innovative dual-lending model, investor-focused incentives, and sustainable tokenomics. With over 7,500 holders and an impressive $5.8 million raised during its presale, the project is rapidly gaining traction in the DeFi space. Investors who enter early stand to gain substantial returns, especially as analysts predict a potential price surge to $4 post-launch. As Phase 4 of the presale nears its end, now is the time to secure MUTM tokens at $0.025 before the price increases. Don’t miss out and join the Mutuum Finance presale today and be part of the future of decentralized finance.

Investor Says Real-World Adoption Holds The Key,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-to-20k-investor-says-real-world-adoption-holds-the-key/,"Ethereum’s chances of reaching the $20,000 level are fueling debate among investors and analysts. The success of the Ethereum network is dependent on real-world usage and rising activity on its platforms, so it is an area of focus in the cryptocurrency space. Related Reading: Pi Coin Sinks 47% In 14 Days—What’s Behind The Massive Drop? Real-World Usage Is The Key Ryan Berckmans, an investor in Ethereum, thinks that the key to a $20,000 ETH price is practical use. He says that the high fees, while normally a disadvantage, are actually an indicator of faith in the altcoin. If users are paying more, it is because they trust in the value of the network. Berckmans makes the comparison with Bitcoin, which continues to hold value despite 99% of its usage being centralized. He reiterates that Ethereum needs to pay attention to developing its real-world growth if it is to replicate this success. For ETH, real world growth is the answer. How do we get ETH to $20k? Fee value accrual obviously isn’t necessary to drive the required public confidence for a high token price, otherwise BTC would be worthless because 99.999% of BTC activity is centralized and doesn’t accrue… — Ryan Berckmans (@ryanberckmans) March 29, 2025 Importance Of High Fees Restoring high total fees is critical for Ethereum’s price increase. Berckmans argues that even if a hypothetical scenario sees $1 trillion in stablecoins on Ethereum’s Layer 1, it wouldn’t be enough without high fees to back it up. He suggests that the Ethereum network must prioritize robust growth to ensure that investor confidence is restored. Without this growth, reaching the ambitious target of $20,000 seems unlikely. Scaling Through Layer 1 And Layer 2 Berckmans stresses the need for more Layer 1 applications and better integration with Layer 2 solutions. This expansion is vital for sustainable growth. Ethereum must increase the distribution of its Layer 1 assets to Layer 2s while also diversifying the solutions available on Layer 2. This kind of scaling is essential to accommodate growing network activity and user demand. Focusing On Utility-Driven Growth As Ethereum celebrates the 10-year anniversary of its mainnet, Berckmans insists that the network has come a long way but still has much further to go.

Ethereum is the most capitalized blockchain by application but will need to scale dramatically to maintain its position. By prioritizing the development of a culture centered around real-world uses and economic development, the crypto asset can build a bridge to its price target. The Ethereum network is at a crossroads. The altcoin needs to maximize real-world usage and have growth at the top of its agenda. In doing so, it may well hit that much-sought $20,000 target in the future — at least according to Berckmans.

The Bitcoin mining landscape is about to get even more interesting. MARA Holdings, a major player in the BTC mining world, has just announced a jaw-dropping plan: a massive $2 billion stock sale. But this isn’t just about raising capital; it’s a strategic play to aggressively expand their Bitcoin reserves. Let’s dive into what this bold move means for MARA Holdings and the broader crypto market. Why is MARA Holdings Launching a $2 Billion Stock Sale? In a nutshell, MARA Holdings, formerly known as Marathon Digital, is doubling down on its Bitcoin acquisition strategy. They’re not just mining Bitcoin; they want to accumulate even more. According to their recent filing with the SEC, they’ve inked an ‘at-the-market’ (ATM) agreement with financial giants like Cantor Fitzgerald and Barclays. This ATM agreement allows MARA to gradually sell shares of its stock on the open market, raising up to a staggering $2 billion. Here’s a breakdown of why this stock sale is significant: Fueling Bitcoin Reserves: The primary goal is clear – to amass more Bitcoin. MARA Holdings is committed to its “full hold strategy,” meaning they are hoarding every precious Satoshi they mine and actively seeking to buy more. Strategic Capitalization: Raising capital through a stock sale in a bullish market allows MARA to leverage its company valuation to acquire a valuable and appreciating asset like Bitcoin. Market Position: This move solidifies MARA Holdings’ position as a leading public company in Bitcoin mining and accumulation. They are signaling strong confidence in Bitcoin’s future. MARA Holdings’ Bitcoin Investment Strategy: A Deep Dive MARA Holdings isn’t just dipping its toes into Bitcoin; they are diving headfirst into the digital gold rush. Their commitment to Bitcoin investment is evident in their current holdings and future plans. Let’s examine their strategy more closely: Full Hold Strategy: Stacking Sats CEO Fred Thiel has emphasized MARA’s “full hold strategy.” This isn’t just lip service. It’s a core philosophy. Unlike some miners who sell Bitcoin to cover operational costs, MARA is committed to keeping every Bitcoin they mine. This long-term vision aligns with the belief in Bitcoin’s increasing value over time. Aggressive Bitcoin Acquisition: Buying the Dip (and the Rips?) The $2 billion raise isn’t solely for mined Bitcoin; MARA explicitly states its intention to purchase even more BTC. As of March, they already held a substantial 46,374 BTC, placing them second only to MicroStrategy among public companies. This new capital injection suggests they are ready to aggressively increase their Bitcoin acquisition , potentially making strategic purchases during market dips or even riding bullish waves. Ranking Among Bitcoin Holders: Chasing MicroStrategy Currently, MARA Holdings proudly sits as the second-largest public company holder of Bitcoin, according to Bitbo data. While trailing behind MicroStrategy, this $2 billion stock sale and subsequent BTC investment could significantly close the gap. Are they aiming for the top spot? It certainly seems like a possibility. What are the Potential Benefits of MARA’s Bitcoin Stock Sale? This strategic maneuver by MARA Holdings is laden with potential benefits, not just for the company but potentially for the wider Bitcoin ecosystem. Let’s unpack some of the key advantages: Increased Bitcoin Holdings: The most direct benefit is a significant increase in MARA’s Bitcoin reserves. This positions them to capitalize on potential future Bitcoin price appreciation. Enhanced Market Valuation: Holding substantial Bitcoin reserves can positively impact MARA’s stock valuation, attracting investors who are bullish on Bitcoin and seeking indirect exposure through publicly traded companies. Strengthened Balance Sheet: Bitcoin, in the eyes of many, is becoming an increasingly accepted store of value. Holding a significant amount can strengthen MARA’s balance sheet and financial stability. Dominance in Bitcoin Mining Sector: By aggressively expanding their Bitcoin holdings, MARA is asserting its dominance and leadership in the Bitcoin mining industry. Are There Any Challenges or Risks? While this move is undoubtedly ambitious , it’s crucial to consider potential challenges and risks associated with MARA’s stock sale and BTC investment strategy: Market Volatility: The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile. A significant Bitcoin price downturn could negatively impact the value of MARA’s holdings and potentially their stock price. Execution Risk: Successfully executing a $2 billion stock sale and deploying that capital effectively into Bitcoin acquisition requires skillful management and market timing. Dilution for Existing Shareholders: Selling new shares dilutes the ownership stake of existing shareholders. While the long-term goal is value creation through Bitcoin appreciation, short-term dilution can be a concern. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Unforeseen regulatory changes could impact MARA’s operations and Bitcoin holdings. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? MARA Holdings’ bold move offers several actionable insights for crypto investors and market observers: Confidence Signal for Bitcoin: A major public company like MARA making such a significant BTC investment sends a strong signal of confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Monitor MARA Stock (MARA): Keep an eye on MARA’s stock performance. It can serve as a proxy for institutional sentiment towards Bitcoin and the mining sector. Broader Trend of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption: This move reinforces the growing trend of institutional adoption of Bitcoin. Expect more public companies to explore similar strategies. Bitcoin Mining Sector in Focus: The Bitcoin mining sector is becoming increasingly important as institutions seek direct exposure to Bitcoin generation and accumulation. Conclusion: MARA Holdings’ Bitcoin Bet – A Game Changer? MARA Holdings’ $2 billion stock sale to fuel its Bitcoin acquisition is a revolutionary and significant development in the cryptocurrency space. It underscores the growing institutional conviction in Bitcoin and signals a potential new phase of aggressive accumulation by public companies. While risks exist, the potential rewards for MARA and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem are substantial.

ETH, together with PI, PEPE, and SOL, should be considered as altcoin to sell because of ongoing market uncertainties. The price of Bitcoin presently faces difficulties in maintaining a position above $81,000. Market-wide digital asset price corrections now occur due to increasing trade war uncertainty, which leads investors to become risk-averse The upcoming Wednesday marks the start of additional tariffs, which deeply concern investors in the markets. A set of new tariffs nearing 20% or above would impose trade restrictions on more than 25 nations, resulting in potential worldwide economic tensions. The Economic Policy Uncertainty Index achieved its highest point bringing forth widespread market concern about the situation.

The ETH price suffered a major decline by falling beneath its essential $1,820 support during widespread market selling activities. The market value of Ethereum is $1,805 at the present moment with around a 15% decline from the previous week. A crypto analyst tweeted that Ethereum faces further price decline if it breaks through the essential support barrier at $1,750. ETH would likely descend to its next significant support level near $1,550 if it breaches the $1,750 local support after Trump announces tariffs. Pi Network (PI) The cryptocurrency Pi Network (PI) has experienced its largest fall of 70% throughout this month, which positions it as the most significant collapse within the top 100 cryptocurrencies. The lack of confidence among its members in PI Network is driving them to sell rapidly. When Pi Network launched in the market, it encountered selling pressure immediately following price stabilization. The latest integrations from Binance and the listing poll did not stop Pi Network from maintaining its bearish price movement. The cryptocurrency PI trades at $0.7064 while revealing an additional 10% decline over the previous 24 hours, ranking it among unsuitable altcoins. Pepe Coin (PEPE) Meme cryptocurrency PEPE Coin (PEPE) has suffered a major price decline, which caused it to break through important support thresholds. The current trading price of PEPE stands at $0.000007074, while the last 24 hours have brought a 7 percent decline.

The market bear control had trapped the asset inside an ongoing descending channel. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) approached the threshold at 38 while remaining in the oversold region. A rejected attempt to exceed the $130 price would establish conditions for another market downturn. A Solana price prediction move under $120 would both break down the breakout pattern and threaten to push the price all the way down to $110, rendering Solana an unfavorable altcoin to avoid until Trump makes his new trade policy announcements.

NFT marketplace X2Y2, which was launched as an alternative to OpenSea and LooksRare, will shut down on April 30, citing a steep decline in trading activity and the challenges of staying competitive. In a March 31 statement , the project’s mysterious TP founder said the X2Y2 team is “sunsetting X2Y2 as an NFT marketplace” after three years in the industry, adding that the “90% shrinkage of NFT trading volume from its peak in 2021 is for sure one of the many reasons.” “The NFT chapter taught us a lot — most of all, that lasting value beats chasing trends. That lesson’s why we’re drawing a line here, not a pause or a maybe, but a full stop on X2Y2 as we knew it.” TP, founder of X2Y2 You might also like: Magic Eden dominates NFT market as its share nears 37%: CoinGecko X2Y2, which was once positioned as a key player in the space, reaching $5.6 billion in all-time trading volume and peaking as the second-largest NFT marketplace behind OpenSea , has since shrunk to $53.6 million, per data from Token Terminal. The platform’s smart contracts will remain operational, allowing users to interact with them, but the team warned that the shutdown could impact its token. “I know this might sting, especially when it comes to token price.

In a recent statement, the company provided important information about the Stablecoin Rate Channel, a metric that has historically identified strong buying opportunities for Bitcoin and altcoins. Alphractal noted that the total market capitalization of stablecoins has been steadily increasing due to new issuances and capital rotation from altcoins to stable assets. This increase plays a crucial role in determining Bitcoin’s market trends. “When the stablecoin reaches the lower dotted line of the Rate Channel, it has historically signaled an excellent entry point for investors,” the firm’s analysts said. “This pattern suggests that there is a significant amount of stablecoins in the market relative to Bitcoin’s market cap, and this often occurs before the Bitcoin price declines and then recovers.” The Stablecoin Rate Channel (long-term) is designed to smooth out short-term volatility using the 90-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) applied to the Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR) Oscillator and further refined with a 7-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Related News: Exemplary Decision on the Most Dangerous Fraud Method for Cryptocurrency Holders The key components of the SSR Oscillator include: Stablecoin Supply Ratio (SSR): This is calculated by dividing Bitcoin's market cap by the stablecoin market cap and further smoothing it with the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). Bollinger Bands Analysis: ±2 standard deviation bands help identify overbought and oversold conditions. Oscillator Signals: Blue Signals: Indicates low oscillator values and usually corresponds to major bottom signals. Red Signals: High oscillator values that signal potential market trend changes.

While the exact timing remains unclear, Alphractal explained that the current setup closely resembles previous accumulation zones that preceded Bitcoin price increases. “A major buy signal has yet to materialize, but based on historical trends we are rapidly approaching an ideal accumulation phase,” the statement said. *This is not investment advice.

Bitcoin (BTC), the king of cryptocurrencies, is facing a potentially grim milestone. Whispers are turning into worried shouts as we approach the end of March, with Bitcoin teetering on the edge of closing out its weakest first quarter (Q1) performance since the bear market days of 2018. Is this just a temporary tremor, or are we looking at something more significant? Let’s dive into the heart of the matter and dissect what’s fueling this unsettling trend in the Bitcoin market. Decoding Bitcoin’s Q1 2024 Performance: A Deep Dive Cointelegraph’s recent analysis has thrown a spotlight on a concerning reality: Bitcoin’s trajectory this March points towards a significant quarterly slump. To put it into perspective, the last time we witnessed such a lackluster Q1 for BTC was back in 2018, a year etched in crypto history for its prolonged market winter. What makes this potential downturn particularly noteworthy is the confluence of factors seemingly conspiring against Bitcoin’s bullish momentum. While the crypto market is known for its volatility, understanding the specific triggers behind this current dip is crucial for navigating the choppy waters ahead. But what exactly is contributing to this potential Q1 washout for Bitcoin? Let’s break down the key elements: Global Economic Jitters: The broader economic landscape is far from serene. Concerns about inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical instability are casting shadows over all markets, including crypto. Bitcoin, while often touted as a hedge against traditional finance, is not immune to these macroeconomic headwinds. Tariff Tensions Spark Market Downturn: Enter former U.S. President Donald Trump, whose recent policy pronouncements have sent ripples of apprehension through global markets. The introduction of a hefty 25% tariff on imported cars, coupled with hints of similar measures targeting the pharmaceutical industry, has ignited fears of escalating trade wars. These protectionist policies tend to spook investors, leading to a flight to safety and a general pullback from risk assets – and yes, cryptocurrencies often fall into this category in times of uncertainty. “Liberation Day” and Trader Anxiety: Adding fuel to the fire is Trump’s cryptic reference to April 2nd as “Liberation Day,” earmarked for unveiling further “reciprocal tariffs.” This ominous date hanging over the market is doing little to soothe trader nerves. The uncertainty surrounding these impending announcements is actively eroding trader confidence and prompting cautious, if not bearish, positioning in the market. Equity Market Mirroring Market Downturn: The traditional stock markets are already reflecting this anxiety. Stock futures have taken a tumble, with DOW futures plummeting by 206 points and S&P futures dipping by 0.56%. Historically, Bitcoin has shown a tendency to mirror movements in equity markets, at least to some extent. This correlation is playing out once again, with BTC prices echoing the downturn in equities. Bitcoin Price Decline: The numbers don’t lie. Bitcoin’s price has been on a consistent downward slide, reaching $81,656 on March 30th. This marks a seven-day streak of losses, painting a clear picture of the selling pressure gripping the Bitcoin market. Is This Just a Blip, or a Sign of a Deeper Bitcoin Market Downturn? The million-dollar question on every crypto investor’s mind is: is this current dip a temporary setback, a buying opportunity in disguise, or a harbinger of a more prolonged market downturn ? Predicting the future in the crypto world is notoriously difficult, but we can analyze the current signals and potential scenarios. Potential Bearish Scenarios: Escalating Tariff Wars: If Trump’s “Liberation Day” announcements indeed unleash a wave of new tariffs, the resulting trade tensions could intensify global economic uncertainty. This could further dampen investor sentiment and exert sustained downward pressure on risk assets like Bitcoin. Broader Economic Slowdown: The tariff issue is just one piece of the puzzle. If the global economy experiences a more pronounced slowdown due to inflation, interest rate hikes, or other factors, Bitcoin and the entire crypto market could face a challenging period. Negative Regulatory Developments: Unfavorable regulatory actions from governments around the world remain a persistent risk for the crypto space. Stricter regulations could stifle innovation and investor enthusiasm, contributing to a prolonged market downturn. Potential Bullish Counterarguments: Bitcoin’s Store of Value Narrative: Despite the current turbulence, Bitcoin’s fundamental value proposition as a decentralized, censorship-resistant store of value remains intact. In times of economic uncertainty, this narrative could actually strengthen as investors seek alternatives to traditional assets. Institutional Adoption: Long-term, the trend of institutional adoption of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is still in play. Increased institutional involvement could provide a significant buffer against short-term market fluctuations and drive long-term price appreciation. Halving Event on the Horizon: The upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will reduce the rate at which new Bitcoin is created, is historically a bullish catalyst. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the halving could reduce supply and potentially boost prices in the medium to long term. Navigating the Current Bitcoin Market Downturn: Actionable Insights So, what should crypto investors do amidst this uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin ? Here are some actionable insights to consider: Actionable Insight Description Stay Informed: Keep a close watch on market developments, economic news, and regulatory updates. Knowledge is your best weapon in navigating volatile markets. Manage Risk: Review your portfolio allocation and risk tolerance. Consider reducing exposure to riskier assets if you feel uncomfortable with the current market conditions. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): If you believe in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, consider employing a dollar-cost averaging strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price, which can help mitigate the risk of buying high. Long-Term Perspective: Remember that crypto markets are cyclical. Focus on the long-term fundamentals and avoid making rash decisions based on short-term price swings. Seek Professional Advice: If you are unsure about how to navigate the current market conditions, consult with a qualified financial advisor who understands the crypto space. Conclusion: Weathering the Bitcoin Storm Bitcoin is indeed facing a challenging period, potentially marking its worst Q1 in years. The confluence of tariffs , economic uncertainties, and broader market jitters is creating a perfect storm. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market is inherently volatile, and periods of market downturn are often followed by periods of recovery and growth. By staying informed, managing risk prudently, and maintaining a long-term perspective, crypto investors can navigate these turbulent times and position themselves for future opportunities in the ever-evolving world of digital assets. The BTC journey is rarely a smooth ride, and this Q1 may just be another test of resilience for the pioneering cryptocurrency.

""After major exchanges delisted XMR, we observed a significant increase in bitcoin inflows,"" Jardine said in an interview with CoinDesk. ""Reduced accessibility is steering users back toward bitcoin."" Many Western markets on the darknet — a part of the internet hosted within an encrypted network and accessible only through specialized anonymity-providing tools — had either fully moved to monero or operated with it in parallel with bitcoin before the delistings. XMR dropped off after it was removed from major exchanges. OKX removed XMR and other privacy-focused tokens including dash (DASH) and ZCash (ZCH) at the end of 2023. Binance announced in February 2024 that it planned to de-list monero. ""When a coin or token no longer meets this standard, or the industry changes, we conduct a more in-depth review and potentially delist it,"" Binance said at the time. On-chain data from BitInfoCharts shows that the daily number of monero transactions has halved from this time last year. ""In order to be an effective kind of medium of exchange, you need a certain amount of liquidity and a certain amount of accessibility,"" Jardine said. Jardine emphasized that illicit cryptocurrency transactions represent only a minor share of total crypto activity. ""Typically, illicit transactions constitute at or below 1% of total crypto activities. While addressing these issues is essential, broadly labeling crypto negatively is inaccurate and counterproductive."" Chainalysis data shows that about 0.14% of all transactions in crypto, some $50 billion, involve illicit activity, with a rise in stablecoins as an illicit payment mechanism. The stablecoin issuers are fighting back, with the Tron-led T3 Financial Crime Unit, a group comprising of Tron, USDT-issuer Tether and TRM Labs freezing over $100 million in illict funds. Jardine also noted that law-enforcement agencies prioritize darknet markets primarily based on their scale and involvement in the fentanyl trade. Its presence significantly escalates the likelihood of a darknet market attracting law enforcement attention, he said, because fighting the drug is a priority for international law enforcement. ""Markets have sort of varying levels of sensitivity to fentanyl-related sales,"" he said. ""Some claim they don't do it, then don't police vendors; some claim they don't do it, but then they do. Some will be selling precursor products but not finished products."" Indeed, one of the most recent darknet market busts was the Nemesis online market. The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) specifically cited the market's role in the fentanyl trade as a reason for the bust. And, as a result, OFAC sanctioned a number of crypto wallets tied to its operator, Behrouz Parsarad: 44 BTC addresses and 5 XMR wallets.",Markets|XMR|Monero|darknet|Privacy Coins,EN,0,0,XMR|MARKET|BTC|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-31 11:45:11

But when a significant player like Gnome Labs makes a substantial BNB transfer , it’s time to pay attention. Just hours ago, blockchain data revealed a noteworthy transaction: Gnome Labs shifted a whopping 10,850 BNB, valued at $6.51 million, to the popular Bybit exchange. Let’s dive into what this could mean and why it’s causing a stir in the crypto community. Gnome Labs’ Mammoth BNB Transfer: What We Know According to the eagle-eyed crypto analysts at The Data Nerd, who cited Arkham data, this large BNB transfer occurred approximately three hours ago. This isn’t an isolated incident either. Data suggests that Gnome Labs has been actively moving assets, having transferred a substantial 76.37 million USDC to both Binance and Bybit over the past month. These movements raise several key questions: Scale of the Transaction: $6.51 million in a single crypto transaction is not a trivial amount. It signifies a potentially strategic move by Gnome Labs. Destination – Bybit Exchange: Why Bybit? Is it for trading, further investment, or something else entirely? Bybit is a well-known exchange, but the specific reason for choosing it in this instance is still unclear. Broader Pattern of Crypto Transactions: The fact that this BNB transfer is part of a larger pattern of USDC movements to Binance and Bybit suggests a deliberate strategy, not just random asset shuffling. Decoding Crypto Transactions: Why Do Whale Movements Matter? Large crypto transactions , especially those involving significant amounts of assets like BNB, are closely watched in the crypto space. These “whale” movements can offer clues about market sentiment and potential future price action. Here’s why these transactions are so important: Market Sentiment Indicator: Large transfers to exchanges can sometimes indicate an intention to sell, potentially leading to increased selling pressure and price drops. Conversely, transfers away from exchanges might suggest accumulation or long-term holding. Strategic Portfolio Adjustments: Entities like Gnome Labs manage vast crypto portfolios. These crypto transactions could be part of routine portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, or strategic shifts in investment focus. Liquidity and Trading Activity: Moving assets to exchanges increases the available liquidity for trading. This can impact market volatility and trading volumes, particularly for the specific cryptocurrency involved (in this case, BNB). Early Warning Signals: Monitoring these large crypto transactions can provide early warnings of potential market shifts or changes in the strategies of major crypto players. Bybit Exchange: A Crypto Hub for Big Moves Bybit, the recipient of this significant BNB transfer , is a prominent cryptocurrency exchange known for its derivatives trading, spot trading, and other crypto services. Why might Gnome Labs choose Bybit for such a large transaction? Factor Possible Reasons for Choosing Bybit Liquidity Bybit offers deep liquidity for BNB and various other cryptocurrencies, facilitating smooth and efficient trading of large volumes. Trading Platform Bybit is recognized for its robust trading platform, advanced order types, and features appealing to institutional and large-scale traders. Geographical Reach Bybit has a global presence, potentially aligning with Gnome Labs’ operational or strategic needs in different regions. Specific Services Bybit offers specific services or trading pairs that might be particularly attractive to Gnome Labs for their strategic objectives. Gnome Labs’ Crypto Portfolio: Beyond the BNB Transfer It’s crucial to consider this BNB transfer within the context of Gnome Labs’ broader crypto activity. The reported movement of 76.37 million USDC to Binance and Bybit over the last month adds another layer to the story. This combined activity could suggest: Diversification and Rebalancing: Gnome Labs might be rebalancing their portfolio, shifting funds between different cryptocurrencies and stablecoins like USDC. Preparation for Market Volatility: Moving USDC to exchanges could be a strategic move to have stablecoins readily available to capitalize on market dips or manage volatility. Operational Needs: These crypto transactions could simply be related to operational expenses, payouts, or other business-related financial activities of Gnome Labs. Navigating the Crypto Market: Actionable Insights from Whale Watching While we can’t definitively know Gnome Labs’ exact motivations, monitoring these types of crypto market analysis points and large transactions provides valuable insights for anyone involved in cryptocurrency: Stay Informed: Keep an eye on blockchain data and crypto news sources like The Data Nerd and Arkham. Tracking whale movements can offer early signals of potential market shifts. Context is Key: Don’t interpret a single BNB transfer in isolation. Look at the broader context – is it part of a larger pattern? What else is happening in the market? Manage Risk: Understand that large transactions can influence market dynamics. Be prepared for potential volatility and adjust your trading or investment strategies accordingly. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Use these insights as starting points for your own research. Don’t rely solely on whale movements, but incorporate them into your overall market analysis. Conclusion: Decoding Crypto Whale Moves for Market Edge The recent BNB transfer by Gnome Labs to Bybit is a compelling example of how on-chain data can offer a glimpse into the strategies of major crypto players. While the exact reasons behind these crypto transactions remain speculative, understanding their potential implications is crucial for navigating the volatile crypto market. By staying informed and analyzing these movements, you can gain a valuable edge in this dynamic and ever-evolving financial landscape.

This is 6% up from a similar survey in September 2023, indicating that interest is on an upward path despite market volatility and past exchange failures. Faith in Controlled Exchanges While uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies is still high—with at least 40% of respondents in all surveys uncertain about future crypto participation—trust in regulated platforms has increased. The survey discovered 20% more respondents feel at ease using regulated exchanges compared to unregulated ones, indicating that regulation and transparency are the drivers of increased adoption. Bitcoin Reigns Supreme as NFT Interest Fades Bitcoin is still the preferred option for potential investors, with more than 80% showing interest—a 7% boost from the first survey. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs), however, have seen decreasing popularity, with interest dropping by 11%. Interest in Tokenized Money Low Despite growing interest in investment, knowledge of tokenized financial products is low. The survey states: 72% not aware of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) 65% not aware of the e-HKD 61% not aware of stablecoins 81% tokenized deposits This is indicative of a knowledge deficit since Hong Kong is still positioning itself as a crypto-friendly center.

42695472,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144629,1743422455,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Insightful Look: Japan’s 2026 Crypto Reclassification Plan Unveiled,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/japan-crypto-reclassification-2026/,"Get ready for a potential seismic shift in the crypto world! Japan, a nation known for its technological prowess and forward-thinking approach, is gearing up to redefine how it regulates cryptocurrencies. The country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) is considering a landmark move that could reclassify cryptocurrencies as financial products. What does this mean for the future of digital assets, and why should you be paying attention? Let’s dive into the details of this exciting development. Decoding Japan’s Crypto Reclassification Initiative According to a recent report by Nikkei, highlighted by Decrypt, the FSA is planning to propose a significant change to its parliament by 2026. This proposal aims to reclassify cryptocurrencies, moving them from their current ambiguous status to recognized financial products . This isn’t just a minor tweak; it’s a fundamental shift in how Japan views and regulates the burgeoning world of digital currencies. The core of this initiative lies in modifying Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act (FIEA). This act is the cornerstone of financial regulation in Japan, and by amending it, the FSA intends to clearly distinguish digital assets from traditional securities. While separating them from securities, the FSA also wants to formally acknowledge the inherent investment characteristics of cryptocurrencies. This dual approach is crucial for creating a regulatory framework that is both robust and adaptable to the unique nature of crypto. Why is Japan Considering This Transformative Change? Several factors are likely driving Japan’s move towards crypto reclassification . Here’s a breakdown: Investor Protection: As the crypto market matures, so does the need for stronger investor safeguards. Reclassifying cryptocurrencies as financial products would allow the FSA to apply existing investor protection measures, similar to those in place for stocks and bonds. This could include stricter disclosure requirements, enhanced security protocols for exchanges, and clearer guidelines for consumer rights. Market Clarity: The current regulatory landscape for crypto in many jurisdictions, including Japan, can be described as somewhat gray. Reclassification offers much-needed clarity. By defining cryptocurrencies within the FIEA framework, businesses and investors will gain a more transparent understanding of the rules of engagement. This clarity can foster innovation and attract more institutional investment. Global Alignment: International regulatory bodies are increasingly focusing on crypto assets. Japan’s move could be seen as an effort to align with emerging global standards and best practices. A clear and comprehensive regulatory framework enhances Japan’s standing as a responsible and forward-thinking player in the global financial arena. Economic Growth: Japan recognizes the economic potential of the crypto industry. By creating a well-regulated environment, the country aims to foster growth in this sector, attract crypto businesses, and potentially become a hub for digital asset innovation in Asia. What are the Potential Benefits of Crypto Reclassification? The proposed Japan crypto regulation overhaul could unlock several benefits for the crypto ecosystem and the broader economy: Increased Institutional Investment: Clarity in regulation often attracts larger, institutional investors who prefer a well-defined legal framework. Reclassification could pave the way for greater institutional participation in the Japanese crypto market, bringing in significant capital and maturity. Enhanced Consumer Trust: Stronger regulations build consumer confidence. Knowing that cryptocurrencies are subject to financial product regulations can reassure investors and encourage wider adoption among the general public. Innovation and Growth: A clear regulatory framework provides a stable foundation for businesses to innovate and grow. Crypto companies operating in Japan would have a clearer roadmap, encouraging investment in new technologies and services. Reduced Regulatory Arbitrage: Consistent and comprehensive regulations can minimize regulatory arbitrage, where businesses seek out jurisdictions with lax rules. A robust framework in Japan can contribute to a more level playing field globally. Challenges and Considerations Ahead While the potential benefits are significant, the path to crypto financial products reclassification is not without its challenges: Defining ‘Financial Product’: The precise definition of ‘financial product’ in the context of cryptocurrencies will be crucial. Regulators need to strike a balance between applying appropriate oversight and avoiding overly burdensome regulations that stifle innovation. Implementation Complexity: Amending the FIEA and implementing new regulations is a complex process. It requires careful consideration of various aspects, including technological nuances, market dynamics, and international standards. Industry Consultation: Effective regulation requires close collaboration with the crypto industry. The FSA’s plan for private consultations with experts is a positive step. Ongoing dialogue with industry stakeholders will be essential to ensure that the regulations are practical and effective. Enforcement and Compliance: Once the new regulations are in place, effective enforcement will be key. The FSA will need to develop the capacity and resources to monitor compliance and address any violations. Roadmap to 2026: What to Expect? The FSA is aiming to propose this legislation to the parliament as early as 2026. This timeline suggests a phased approach involving: Expert Consultations: The FSA is currently in the phase of private consultations with experts to refine the proposed changes. This stage is critical for gathering diverse perspectives and ensuring a well-informed regulatory framework. Legislative Drafting: Following consultations, the FSA will draft the specific amendments to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. This will involve legal and technical expertise to translate the policy objectives into concrete legal language. Parliamentary Approval: The drafted legislation will then be presented to the Japanese parliament for debate and approval. This process can take time and may involve revisions based on parliamentary discussions. Implementation and Enforcement: Once approved, there will be a period for implementation, including the development of detailed guidelines and enforcement mechanisms. The FSA will likely work with the industry to ensure a smooth transition to the new regulatory regime. The Global Impact of Japan’s Crypto Policy Shift Japan’s move to reclassify cryptocurrencies as digital assets Japan is watching closely could have ripple effects globally. As one of the world’s major economies and a significant player in the crypto space, Japan’s regulatory decisions often influence other jurisdictions. If Japan successfully implements a clear and effective framework for crypto financial products, it could set a precedent for other countries grappling with similar regulatory challenges. Furthermore, it could boost international confidence in the crypto market as a whole. A well-regulated crypto sector in Japan could attract global investment and foster greater collaboration among nations on crypto regulation. This is particularly relevant as international bodies like the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are increasingly emphasizing the need for global coordination in crypto regulation. Actionable Insights: What Does This Mean for You? Whether you are a crypto investor, a business operating in the crypto space, or simply someone interested in the future of finance, Japan’s FSA crypto policy shift is something to watch closely. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Keep abreast of developments in Japanese crypto regulation. Follow news outlets specializing in crypto and financial regulation for updates on the FSA’s proposals and timelines. Assess Market Opportunities: If you are a crypto business, consider the potential opportunities that a clearer regulatory environment in Japan could offer. This could be a strategic location for expansion or new ventures. Understand Regulatory Trends: Japan’s approach could signal broader trends in global crypto regulation. Analyze the specifics of Japan’s proposed framework to anticipate potential regulatory changes in other jurisdictions. Engage in Dialogue: If you are part of the crypto industry, consider engaging in discussions with regulatory bodies and industry associations. Your input can help shape effective and balanced regulations. Conclusion: A New Dawn for Crypto Regulation in Japan? Japan’s move to potentially reclassify cryptocurrencies as financial products by 2026 marks a potentially transformative moment for the crypto industry. This initiative, driven by the FSA, reflects a proactive approach to creating a robust and investor-friendly regulatory environment. While challenges remain, the potential benefits – from increased institutional investment to enhanced consumer trust – are substantial. As Japan moves forward with its plan, the world will be watching, learning, and perhaps, following suit. This could indeed be the dawn of a new era for crypto regulation, not just in Japan, but globally.

Optimism on US President Donald Trump’s re-election and expectations of a pro-crypto policy, quickly gave way to textbook “sell-the-news” trading as tangible regulatory changes have failed to materialise. Since it’s all-time high, Bitcoin has traded as far down as $77,041, a near 29 percent drop , and has largely oscillated in a trading range between $78,000 and $88,000. Bitcoin Dominance vs Total Crypto Market Capitalisation Market breadth, however, continues to favour Bitcoin, with BTC dominance rising to over 61 percent even as the total crypto market cap declined sharply—signalling capital rotation from riskier altcoins into Bitcoin during heightened macro uncertainty. Ethereum and Solana and other altcoins have fallen by more than 35-50 percent from their cycle highs, reinforcing Bitcoin’s status as the reserve asset of the digital market. As Q2 begins, price action remains reactive to macroeconomic signals, with Fed policy and ETF flows expected to dictate direction. For now, signs of capitulation have eased, but with liquidity still tight, a breakout will likely require a significant catalyst. In terms of the macro picture, some parts of the US economy are showing signs of resilience—such as a narrowing trade deficit and a rise in durable goods spending—but these bright spots are overshadowed by deeper structural concerns. Inflation is accelerating faster than expected, fuelled in part by rising import costs tied to new tariffs. Core inflation rose 0.4 percent in February, marking its sharpest monthly gain in over a year, while consumer expectations suggest inflation could stay elevated well into the future. Disposable Personal Income, Outlays and Saving (Source: US Bureau of Economic Analysis) At the same time, growth is slowing. Real income gains remain tepid once government transfers are excluded , and services spending—a key economic driver—has begun to contract. Consumer confidence is eroding, with the Conference Board index falling to a two-year low and more Americans anticipating rising unemployment. These trends point to growing caution among households, reflected in a rising personal savings rate . Trade policy remains a central pressure point . Recent tariff hikes and expectations of further measures in April and May are prompting businesses and consumers to adjust behaviour, front-loading purchases, delaying investments, or scaling back hiring. While the February trade deficit narrowed , this followed a January import surge that likely distorted GDP forecasts. As a result, first-quarter growth is expected to slow sharply. Despite these ongoing economic uncertainties, the broader cryptocurrency industry is still benefiting from the increasing commitment to regulatory clarity, underpinned by political support, and growing institutional interest. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has officially dropped its lawsuits against Kraken, Consensys, and Cumberland DRW—three major players in the industry. This move signals a significant shift from the agency’s previous enforcement-heavy stance to a more collaborative regulatory approach. It also foreshadows a commitment to establishing clear, constructive rules for the industry. Further solidifying this direction, the SEC’s Crypto Task Force announced four upcoming roundtables to be held between April and June 2025. These sessions will engage stakeholders on key issues such as crypto trading regulation, custody of digital assets, tokenisation, and the future of decentralised finance (DeFi). The events are open to the public and reflect the SEC’s intent to foster open dialogue and transparency in shaping crypto policy. In parallel, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG) has announced a high-profile partnership with Crypto.com to launch a series of crypto-focused ETFs. This venture marks TMTG’s expansion into financial products, aiming to tap into the growing demand for digital asset investment vehicles. While the initiative still awaits regulatory approval, it could significantly boost the visibility of both TMTG and Crypto.com within traditional finance circles.

42695893,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=144626,1743423059,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Exclusive: Movement Labs Clarifies Massive MOVE Token Coinbase Deposit – Is a Crypto Loan Incoming?,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/move-token-coinbase-deposit-loan/,"In a surprising turn of events that caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts and market analysts alike, blockchain firm Movement Labs recently deposited a substantial 17.15 million MOVE tokens, valued at $7.74 million, into the prominent Coinbase exchange. This significant Coinbase deposit immediately sparked speculation about a potential large-scale sale or transfer of these tokens. However, Rushi Manche, the co-founder of Movement Labs, quickly stepped in to clarify the situation, taking to social media platform X to set the record straight. What exactly is behind this intriguing move, and what does it mean for the future of MOVE and Movement Labs? Decoding the Coinbase Deposit: Not a Sale, But a Strategic Move Addressing the swirling rumors and assumptions, Manche explicitly stated that the Coinbase deposit was “not intended for sale or transfer.” This straightforward denial immediately quelled concerns among MOVE token holders and the wider crypto community who might have feared a potential price dip due to a large sell-off. Instead, Manche revealed the deposit serves a much more strategic purpose: it’s connected to the launch of an upcoming institutional product from Movement Labs and a corresponding crypto loan . This revelation offers a fascinating glimpse into the evolving strategies within the cryptocurrency space. Instead of simply listing tokens for public trading, Movement Labs is leveraging Coinbase’s institutional infrastructure to facilitate a more complex financial maneuver. Let’s break down what we know: Purpose-Driven Deposit: The 17.15 million MOVE token deposit is specifically for an upcoming institutional product and associated loan, not for open market sales. Strategic Finance: Movement Labs is utilizing a crypto loan mechanism, likely secured by the deposited MOVE tokens, to fund or facilitate the launch of their new institutional product . Clarity from the Top: Co-founder Rushi Manche’s direct communication via X highlights the importance of transparency in the fast-paced crypto world, directly addressing community concerns. What is This ‘Institutional Product’ and Why a Crypto Loan? While details about the exact nature of the institutional product remain under wraps, the term itself suggests that Movement Labs is targeting larger financial players, investment firms, or other institutions rather than individual retail investors. This pivot towards institutional clients is a growing trend in the crypto industry, reflecting the increasing maturity and acceptance of digital assets within traditional finance. The decision to utilize a crypto loan in conjunction with this product launch also raises interesting questions. Why opt for a loan instead of other funding methods? Here are some potential benefits and considerations: Benefit Explanation Capital Efficiency A loan allows Movement Labs to access capital without selling their MOVE tokens, potentially preserving their long-term value and avoiding dilution. Strategic Flexibility Loan terms can be structured to align with the product launch timeline and anticipated revenue streams. Institutional Alignment Using established financial instruments like loans can make the product more appealing and familiar to institutional investors. Potential for Growth The capital from the crypto loan can be strategically deployed to accelerate product development, marketing, and overall growth initiatives. Movement Labs and the MOVE Token: A Quick Overview For those less familiar, Movement Labs is a blockchain firm focused on building innovative solutions within the crypto space. The MOVE token is the native cryptocurrency of their ecosystem, likely playing a crucial role in the functionality and utility of their products, including this upcoming institutional product . Understanding the context of Movement Labs and MOVE is crucial to grasping the significance of this Coinbase deposit and strategic financial maneuvering. The fact that Movement Labs is engaging with Coinbase for institutional-level activities underscores the exchange’s growing role beyond retail trading. Coinbase has been actively expanding its services to cater to institutional clients, recognizing the increasing demand from larger players to participate in the crypto market. This Coinbase deposit could be seen as another example of this trend in action. Actionable Insights and What to Watch For So, what can we learn from this situation, and what should crypto enthusiasts and investors keep an eye on? Institutional Adoption is Key: This event highlights the increasing institutionalization of crypto. Watch for more projects and exchanges focusing on institutional-grade products and services. Strategic Token Utilization: Projects are becoming more sophisticated in how they utilize their native tokens beyond just fundraising or exchange listings. Pay attention to innovative financial strategies like crypto loans and institutional partnerships. Transparency Matters: Rushi Manche’s proactive communication is a positive example. Follow project leaders and official channels for timely and accurate information, especially during periods of market speculation. MOVE Token and Movement Labs Development: Keep an eye on Movement Labs’ announcements regarding their new institutional product . Its success could significantly impact the utility and value of the MOVE token. A Bold Move or Calculated Risk? Movement Labs’ strategic Coinbase deposit and planned crypto loan represent a potentially groundbreaking approach to launching institutional products in the crypto space. By clarifying their intentions and focusing on institutional finance, they are signaling a mature and calculated approach to growth. While the specifics of the institutional product remain a secret for now, the market will be keenly observing the outcomes of this bold initiative. This move could set a new precedent for how crypto projects engage with institutional investors and utilize their token reserves for strategic financial operations.

Latest reports show that investors of Shiba Inu now hope towards a new token called Remittix . The majority of analysts report that Remittix can potentially go 20x in April alone. It is promoted as a new DeFi project that has a real solution for day-to-day problems. Its low and humble DeFi coin price is currently for investors seeking long-term growth. This has made many investors rethink their portfolios. Shiba Inu Price: A Token with Volatility SHIB has quite often experienced price volatility. Shiba Inu price recently experienced a drop of just 1% in the last 24 hours alone. Certain technical charts have SHIB in downtrend and may take a very long time to recover. The investors refer to some Shiba Inu price predictions that state worse turbulence on the horizon. The token’s high supply and market mood make it prone to price volatility. Most watchers of the Shiba Inu price anticipate a turn-around, but current momentum indicates otherwise. Despite the reality that the coin still enjoys strong community backing, it cannot exhibit stability in the long term. Analysts say with no clear gains in network efficiency on the horizon, SHIB may continue to struggle. SHIB will drop by 2.19% and hit $0.00001268 by April 25. Remittix Revolutionizes Cross-Border Money Transfers Cross-border remittances in the long run have been marked by slow processes with burdensome charges. Customers have to face delays in their daily financial requirements. The existing high velocity of the new world demands solutions that offer speed and low costs and traditional approaches fail to meet this. A new system within Remittix makes it easier for users to handle their transactions. The token price of $0.0734 has assisted the project in raising $14.2 million from the sale of 524 million tokens. These financial statistics indicate that users highly prefer this new solution and its development is still growing. All transactions done on Remittix are governed by an incorruptible blockchain ledger that provides end-to-end transaction security and transparency. Digital wallets in this scenario provide access to direct bank accounts and local cash pick-up points avoiding traditional payment intermediaries. Remittix achieves day-to-day usage through minimizing steps and decreasing fees which is beneficial to migrant laborers and small business people and families in need of speedy money transfers.

This time, the company purchased 22,048 BTC for $1.92 billion, bringing its total holdings to 528,185.

Tokenomist data shows these releases are split between single “cliff” one-time releases and regular “linear” releases distributed across various blockchain projects. Cliff unlocks are led by SUI SUI leads this week’s cliff unlocks with 64.19 million tokens valued at $148.93 million set to be released. This unlock represents 2.14% of SUI’s supply. Second in terms of value is the W token, which will release an enormous 1.39 billion tokens valued at $118.12 million. This unlock represents 46.27% of W’s unlock supply and is among the biggest percentage increases of major tokens this week. ENA takes the third spot with 212.50 million tokens worth $78.81 million (4.02% of unlock supply). This is then followed by OP with 31.34 million tokens worth $23.40 million (2.11% of unlock supply). BIGTIME will unlock 333.33 million tokens worth $16.36 million, which is 26.96% of its unlock supply. Large token cliff and linear unlocks in the week between March 31 and April 7. Source: Wu Blockchain Some of the other significant cliff unlocks apart from SUI are ZETA (44.26 million tokens, $13.35 million, 6.20% of supply), KAS (153.24 million tokens, $9.90 million, 0.59% of supply), NEON (53.91 million tokens, $6.79 million, 7.44% of supply), and DYDX (8.33 million tokens, $5.36 million, 1.30% of supply). The varying percentages of supply being unlocked suggest different potential market impacts across these tokens. As per the data, W and BIGTIME face the largest proportional increases in circulating supply at 46.27% and 26.96%, respectively. Solana leads linear unlocks Solana (SOL) remains at the top of the linear unlock space. According to the data, 465,770 SOL tokens worth $58.80 million are set for release over a period of time in the coming week. In spite of this large dollar amount, the unlock represents only 0.09% of the circulating supply of SOL. Coming in second to SOL in the linear unlock category is Worldcoin (WLD), which will distribute 37.23 million tokens valued at approximately $29.22 million. This distribution represents 3.06% of WLD’s circulating supply. TIA comes in third with 6.96 million tokens valued at $22.69 million, representing 1.20% of its circulating supply. A number of other top cryptocurrencies will also have linear unlocks throughout this time. Optimism (OM) will unlock 2.65 million tokens valued at $16.46 million (0.27% of supply), and meme favorite Dogecoin (DOGE) will have 96.52 million tokens valued at $15.84 million unlocked. Avalanche (AVAX) will release 700,000 tokens worth $13.22 million (0.17% of supply), and TAO will unlock 50.40K tokens worth $11.38 million (0.60% of supply). There are smaller linear unlocks such as IP ($11.97 million), JTO ($9.38 million), SUI ($8.63 million), DOT ($9.32 million), NEAR ($7.68 million), and FIL ($7.10 million). Interestingly enough, SUI is listed under both cliff and linear unlock types, with the total combined releases exceeding $157 million. The two unlock types have varying vesting schedules for different token allocations. Linear unlocks typically create less immediate market pressure than cliff unlocks. This is because tokens are gradually released over time rather than becoming available all at once. Less popular token unlocks Beyond the headline-grabbing unlocks from major tokens, several smaller cryptocurrency projects are also releasing substantial portions of their token supply this week as per CoinMarketCap data. GUNZ will unlock 604.5 million GUN tokens, though the token currently shows no price or market capitalization data. With no active trading yet visible, this initial distribution may establish baseline market conditions for the token. Token unlock and vesting schedules. Source: CoinMarketCap Shockwaves (NEUROS) is also ahead in its unlock plan at 72.13% done. The token has a future release of 1.89 million NEUROS tokens equating to about $12,083.78. This comparatively small unlock accounts for 1.89% of the total locked supply for a token trading at $0.006382 currently. Hooked Protocol (HOOK) is near the mid-point of its unlock process with 47.33% of the process complete. The impending release will unlock 8.33 million HOOK tokens worth $1.05 million. The AC Milan Fan Token (ACM) has surpassed 52.79% of its unlock schedule. It will unlock 205,263 ACM tokens representing approximately $190,467 soon. This is equivalent to 1.03% of locked tokens for a project currently valued at $0.9279 per token. MAXX AI (MXM) has completed 33.70% of its unlock process, and 19.71 million MXM tokens worth $32,019.42 are available for release. The smaller unlocks may then be subject to more pronounced price effects in relation to their size in the marketplace.

While Vanguard has publicly expressed skepticism towards crypto, their significant investment in GameStop, the video game retailer, could inadvertently lead to Vanguard Bitcoin exposure . Let’s dive into how this intriguing situation is unfolding and what it could mean for the broader landscape of institutional crypto adoption. Unveiling Vanguard’s Indirect Bitcoin Exposure via GameStop The narrative takes an interesting twist as GameStop, a company once at the heart of a meme stock frenzy, is now venturing into the realm of digital assets. Last week, GameStop’s board gave the green light to a strategic plan that includes holding Bitcoin as a treasury asset. This means GameStop could potentially allocate a portion of its cash reserves, and even future financing, to purchase Bitcoin. This bold move by GameStop is where Vanguard’s indirect Bitcoin exposure comes into play. As a major shareholder in GameStop, Vanguard’s portfolio is now, in a way, tethered to GameStop’s Bitcoin strategy. Here’s a breakdown of the key points to understand this developing situation: GameStop Embraces Bitcoin: GameStop’s decision to add Bitcoin to its treasury reserves marks a significant shift for the company and signals a growing acceptance of digital assets in the corporate world. Vanguard’s Stake in GameStop: As a substantial investor in GameStop, Vanguard’s financial performance is linked to GameStop’s success and strategic decisions, including this foray into Bitcoin. Indirect Exposure, Not Direct Investment: It’s crucial to note that Vanguard isn’t directly investing in Bitcoin. Their exposure is indirect, stemming from their investment in a company that is now choosing to hold Bitcoin. Vanguard’s Stance on Crypto: Vanguard has historically been wary of cryptocurrencies. As Janel Jackson, former global head of ETF Capital Markets at Vanguard, stated last year, they didn’t believe crypto had a place in long-term portfolios. This indirect exposure is therefore quite a noteworthy development. Why is GameStop Betting on Bitcoin? GameStop’s pivot to include GameStop Bitcoin on its balance sheet raises several questions. What’s driving this decision? Here are a few potential reasons: Diversification of Treasury Assets: Companies often diversify their treasury holdings to mitigate risk and potentially enhance returns. Bitcoin, as a non-correlated asset, could be seen as a way to diversify away from traditional assets. Future-Proofing the Business: In a rapidly evolving digital world, embracing digital assets like Bitcoin could be seen as a move to future-proof GameStop’s business and appeal to a tech-savvy customer base. Capitalizing on Bitcoin’s Potential: GameStop might believe in the long-term growth potential of Bitcoin and see it as an investment opportunity to grow their assets. Following Market Trends: With more and more companies and even countries exploring Bitcoin, GameStop might be aligning itself with a broader trend of digital asset adoption. Institutional Crypto Investment: A Paradigm Shift? GameStop’s move, and consequently Vanguard’s indirect involvement, occurs within a larger context of growing institutional crypto investment . For years, institutional investors were largely on the sidelines when it came to cryptocurrencies. Concerns about volatility, regulation, and understanding the technology kept many at bay. However, the tide seems to be turning. Factors driving increased institutional interest in crypto include: Factor Description Maturing Market The cryptocurrency market is becoming more mature with increased liquidity, better infrastructure, and more regulated exchanges. Inflation Concerns Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a potential hedge against inflation, attracting investors seeking to preserve capital. Growing Adoption Increased adoption by corporations, payment processors, and even nation-states is lending legitimacy to the crypto space. Potential for High Returns Despite volatility, the potential for high returns in the crypto market remains a significant draw for institutional investors. While Vanguard itself may not be ready to directly embrace Bitcoin, this indirect exposure through GameStop could subtly shift their perspective over time. It’s a fascinating case study in how even traditional financial institutions are becoming entangled with the crypto world, even if unintentionally at first. Bitcoin as a Treasury Asset: A New Corporate Strategy GameStop’s decision to adopt Bitcoin treasury management is part of a growing trend. Companies like MicroStrategy and Tesla have already made headlines by adding Bitcoin to their corporate treasuries. This strategy, while still relatively new, presents both potential benefits and challenges for corporations. Potential Benefits of Bitcoin Treasury: Enhanced Returns: Bitcoin’s potential for price appreciation could lead to significant gains on corporate balance sheets. Diversification: Bitcoin offers diversification benefits due to its low correlation with traditional assets. Innovation Signaling: Adopting Bitcoin can signal a company’s innovative and forward-thinking approach. Hedge Against Inflation: Bitcoin can act as a hedge against inflationary pressures, preserving the value of corporate reserves. Potential Challenges of Bitcoin Treasury: Volatility: Bitcoin’s price volatility can introduce significant fluctuations in corporate balance sheets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, creating uncertainty for corporations. Accounting and Tax Complexity: Accounting for and taxing Bitcoin holdings can be complex and require specialized expertise. Security Risks: Storing and securing Bitcoin holdings requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. The Future of Crypto Adoption: Will Vanguard Follow Suit? The unfolding situation with Vanguard and GameStop raises a crucial question: Will this indirect crypto adoption eventually lead to a change in Vanguard’s official stance on cryptocurrencies? It’s too early to say for sure, but here are a few possible scenarios: No Immediate Change: Vanguard might maintain its current stance, viewing this as an isolated case related to GameStop and not a reflection of their own investment strategy. Gradual Shift in Perspective: As Vanguard observes GameStop’s Bitcoin strategy and the broader institutional crypto landscape, their internal views might gradually evolve. They might start exploring crypto in more detail, even if direct investment remains off the table for now. Indirect Crypto Products: Vanguard could potentially consider offering indirect crypto products, such as ETFs that invest in companies with Bitcoin exposure, without directly holding Bitcoin themselves. This could be a way to cater to client demand while staying within their comfort zone. Eventual Direct Involvement: While less likely in the near term, if the regulatory environment becomes clearer and institutional crypto adoption continues to grow, Vanguard might eventually reconsider its direct involvement in the crypto market. The GameStop-Vanguard situation is a microcosm of the broader tension between traditional finance and the burgeoning crypto world. It highlights how even institutions hesitant about crypto are finding themselves, sometimes unexpectedly, connected to this revolutionary asset class. Conclusion: A Quiet Revolution in Institutional Finance? Vanguard’s potential indirect exposure to Bitcoin through GameStop is more than just a quirky financial footnote. It represents a subtle yet significant shift in the narrative surrounding institutional crypto investment . While Vanguard may not be intentionally embracing Bitcoin, this situation underscores the increasing pervasiveness of crypto within the financial ecosystem. As more companies explore Bitcoin treasury strategies and institutional interest continues to grow, even the most traditional players may find it harder to remain completely on the sidelines. The journey of institutional crypto adoption is unfolding in unexpected ways, and Vanguard’s GameStop connection is a compelling example of this quiet revolution.

The coin has crashed for five days, erasing most gains made earlier this month, and moving to its March 14 low. Fundamentals, including the rising number of holders, and its technicals point to a big surge. Shiba Inu Price Could Rise as Holders Reach 1.5 Million On-chain data show that the number of Shiba Inu coin holders has continued rising even as the coin crashed from $0.00003341 to $0.00001200. Data shows that the number of SHIB holders has crossed the important 1.5 million milestone, making it one of the most held coins in the market. This growth is mostly because Shiba Inu has some of the best fundamentals in the meme coin industry. It is highly deflationary, with the number of SHIB coins in circulation being 584 trillion, down from 999 trillion since its inception. The SHIB burb rate jumped by 750% on Monday to 17.1 million. Just last week, two SHIB holders burned 1 billion SHIB tokens in separate transactions. Token burns help to boost a coin value by making the remaining ones rarer. Shiba Inu also unveiled Shibarium, a layer-2 network whose transactions are nearing 1 billion, and the number of addresses has soared to 193.5 million . Recent data shows that the total value locked in Shibarium has soared by over 20% in the 30 days. Shibarium Stats SHIB Price Signal Points to a Surge The daily chart paints a gloomy picture of the SHIB price. It peaked at $0.00003341 in December and has now plunged by over 63%. Its attempts to recover have faced substantial resistance, with the most recent one being at $0.00001565, where it formed a shooting star candlestick, a popular bearish sign. However, a closer inspection shows that the Shiba Inu price has formed some bullish patterns that point to an eventual recovery. It formed a falling wedge pattern between November and mid-March this month. SHIB moved slightly above the upper side of the wedge pattern and reached a high of $0.00001566. The recent drop, therefore, is likely part of the break-and-retest pattern, where an asset retests a key level. In this case, it wants to retest the upper line of this wedge. Most notably, Shiba Inu price is at a key level where it has failed to move below since July last year. That is a sign that it has formed a quadruple bottom whose neckline is at $0.00003340. Shiba Inu Price Chart Therefore, the coin will likely bounce back as bulls target last December’s high of $0.00003340, up by 175% above the current level. A drop below the key support at $0.00001080 will invalidate the bullish Shiba Inu forecast .
