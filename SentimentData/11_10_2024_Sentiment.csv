This is bullish for the flagship crypto, considering what happened last year when the fractal pattern formed. Bitcoin Prices Flashes Fractal Similar To October 2023 TradingShot mentioned in a TradingView post that the Bitcoin fractal similar to the one that occurred in October 2023 is happening again. He explained that the similarities are more evident in the 1D timeframe, where the Bitcoin price currently ranges within the 1D 50-day moving average (MA) and the 1D 200 MA. According to him, BTC also traded similarly precisely a year ago in the first two weeks of October 2023. Related Reading: Dogecoin Vs. Bitcoin: Gauging The Performances Of Two Crypto Giants This Cycle In October 2023, BTC is said to have made a marginal break above the 1D 200 MA before quickly pulling back below it. TradingShot further revealed that the Bitcoin price started its “long-term aggressive rally” of the Channel Up after it tested and held the 1D 50 MA, peaking on March 14 this year, when it hit its current all-time high (ATH) of $73,000. Interestingly, Bitcoin tested and held this 1D 50 MA at the start of this month, indicating another long-term aggressive rally might be on the horizon. TradingShot claimed that as long as the 1-week 50 MA continues to hold as the long-term support, there is a high probability that the Bitcoin price could hit $100,000 even before the end of this year. From a fundamentals angle, market experts like Standard Chartered have also predicted that Bitcoin could reach $100,000 even before the US presidential elections on November 5. Meanwhile, Bernstein analysts expect BTC to at least come close to this price level based on their prediction that the flagship crypto could hit $90,000 if Donald Trump wins the elections. What Next For The Leading Crypto? The Bitcoin price has remained stagnant amid market uncertainty thanks to the macro data, the upcoming US elections and rising tensions in the Middle East. This has raised questions about what to expect next from the leading crypto with such a bearish outlook. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has provided some insights, predicting that BTC could soon lose the $60,000 support level. Related Reading: Standard Chartered Analysts Says Ethereum Price Will Reach $10,000 If This Happens While noting that Bitcoin remains stuck in a descending parallel channel, Martinez remarked that a recent rejection of the upper bounder could lead to a decline to the middle boundary at $58,000. He added that the BTC price could drop to the lower boundary at $52,000. According to him, a bullish breakout for Bitcoin won’t happen until its price clears $66,000. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $61,000, down almost 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

As bullish sentiment begins to build, market participants are now focused on whether UNI can maintain this upward momentum and break new ground. As UNI continues to display strength, this analysis aims to determine whether Uniswap’s recent upward movement in spite of the broader bearish market conditions, has the potential to break through key resistance levels and reach new highs by examining the current price action and technical indicators. Indicators Point Toward More Upward Movement For Uniswap On the 4-hour chart, Uniswap is showing strength as it approaches the $8.7 resistance level while trading above the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). UNI’s positioning above the SMA indicates a firm trend, suggesting that buyers are gaining confidence with the potential of targeting higher resistance levels. An analysis of the 4-hour Relative Strength Index (RSI) points to the possibility of continued upward movement, as the RSI has rebounded to the 73% threshold after previously dipping to 52%. This rise indicates that positive momentum is gaining traction, suggesting that buyers are increasingly in control and that further gains could be on the horizon. Related Reading: UNI Bullish Rebound Signals Upsurge, Targets $8.7 Resistance Ahead After successfully breaking above the daily 100-day SMA, UNI has been exhibiting strong upbeat movement signifying a shift in market sentiment, with buyers gaining confidence and pushing the price higher. If Uniswap can sustain this push, it may open the door for additional price appreciation and challenge higher resistance levels. Furthermore, the RSI on the daily chart is currently at 65%, having risen from a previous low of 43%. This upward movement suggests that UNI is gaining momentum, signaling more growth. If buying interest continues to hold steady, the positive trajectory indicated by the RSI could support an extended rally for Uniswap, reinforcing positive sentiment in the market. Potential Upside Targets: How Far Can the Bulls Push UNI? As Uniswap maintains its upward momentum, the immediate resistance level to watch is $8.7, which could pave the way for a challenge of higher thresholds if surpassed. A breakout above this level could see UNI targeting the $10.3 mark, where significant psychological resistance may come into play. Related Reading: UNI In Trouble? Key Indicators Cites Potential Drop Amid Market Downturn However, if Uniswap fails to maintain this strength and breaks above the $8.7 resistance level, it could result in a pullback, with the price sliding back toward the $6.7 support zone. A breakdown below this level could lead to more losses, possibly targeting lower support areas.

However, this capitulation could be followed by a “full bull” market. Bitcoin Headed Lower Before Higher In a detailed thread on X about BTC price analysis, crypto analyst Cole Garner stated that capitulation might be on the horizon for the leading digital asset. Garner attributes the potential downturn to tightening on-chain liquidity. Related Reading: Bitcoin ETF Options Set To Supercharge Price Volatility, Expert Warns Tracking global liquidity from central banks worldwide, the analyst said he sees a “buy signal” for digital assets. However, more downsides for cryptocurrencies could come before liquidity-enhancing measures undertaken by central banks buoy them. In his analysis, Garner stated that “if China doesn’t ring that bell, the Fed or Japan should do the job,” likely pointing toward the recent economic stimulus injected by the Chinese central bank in a bid to boost the country’s grim economic outlook. Garner referenced the recent economic stimulus from China’s central bank but noted that this week, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) refrained from injecting additional liquidity, tempering expectations for risk-on assets like crypto. Garner emphasized the low supply of stablecoins compared to the beginning of October 2024. Analyzing the “Bitfinex grail,” which is essentially the total supply of two leading stablecoins on the exchange – USDT and USDC – Garner noted its quarterly rate of change is declining, potentially leading to lower prices for digital assets in the short term. Despite these concerns, Garner pointed out that Bitcoin has printed a higher high on the 8-hour chart, and the market structure remains bullish. Even if BTC dips to its range lows in the high $40k range, the overall price action is still considered positive. Garner suggested that should BTC hit its range of lows, traders and investors can consider buying at that price. Even if they are low on liquid cash, they must ensure they don’t get spooked by the market and panic-sell their current holdings. Another crypto analyst, Ali, seemed to echo Garner’s outlook, stating that Bitcoin is stuck in a descending parallel channel and runs the risk of sliding to channel lows of around $52,000. The analyst stressed that BTC must overcome the $66,000 level for a bullish breakout. Can Bitcoin Hit New All-Time Highs In 2024? With the remainder of 2024 ahead, Bitcoin bulls anticipate interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) to fuel a new rally. However, BTC must clear several hurdles to sustain its bullish momentum. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Puell Multiple Signals A Bullish Surge: Could A New ATH Be Near? Crypto analyst Carl Runefelt recently noted that BTC must overcome the $64,000 resistance level to trigger a rally in Q4 2024. Failure to break through this price level could lead to further downside. Further, Bitcoin’s price finally turned green in October, giving bulls hopes of another “uptober” for the asset, which was marked by significant price increases. BTC trades at $60,711 at press time, down 2.4% in the last 24 hours.

This unappealing performance has led to a CryptoQuant analyst, Aytekin, raising and sharing insight on an important question: “Is it reasonable to expect a final shakeout before the next big move?” Related Reading: Is The Worst Over For Bitcoin? Analyst Suggests Local Bottom May Be Here Bitcoin Next Move: Major Correction Looming? In a recent post on the CryptoQuant QuickTake platform, the analyst explained that Bitcoin is currently in a high open interest zone, having exceeded the critical $18 billion level. Historically, when open interest levels reached this point, major corrections followed. The analyst mentioned that the current market sentiment appears divided, noting: The market seems indecisive in many aspects, with some believing that the next big upside move is on the horizon, while others think BTC’s downward trend remains strong. A common belief is that BTC may need a final shakeout before surging to a new all-time high (ATH). Aytekin added that funding rates, though slightly above the 200-day simple moving average (SMA), suggest that long traders are still dominant. However, significant price corrections in the past often occurred when funding rates turned negative, which hasn’t happened yet. Aytekin concluded that, while a final shakeout might occur, the depth of the correction may not be as severe given the relatively moderate funding rates. BTC Price Outlook As Bitcoin has struggled to break through key resistance levels, its recent price action reflects ongoing market indecision. Over the past few weeks, Bitcoin maintained stability above the $60,000 mark, but failed to make a major move to reclaim $70,000. In the past 24 hours, Bitcoin has slipped by 2.9%, currently trading at $60,485. This decline follows the asset’s brief surge to $63,774 earlier in the week, which sparked optimism for a possible move toward the $65,000 and then $70,000 mark. Prominent crypto analyst Ali recently commented on Bitcoin’s price action, noting that Bitcoin is still trading within a “descending parallel channel.” According to Ali, the asset was rejected at the upper boundary of this channel, signalling the potential for further downside. “We might see a drop to the middle boundary at $58,000 or even the lower boundary at $52,000,” Ali noted in a post on X. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Path To $80,000 “Melt-Up” In Q4 2024 – Details Inside He emphasized that a bullish breakout is unlikely unless Bitcoin clears the $66,000 level, a price point that has acted as a significant resistance point in recent weeks. #Bitcoin remains stuck in a descending parallel channel.

As ADA’s price falls 2.9%, some analysts warn of the next key level to watch out for. Related Reading: Worldcoin Drops 6% Amid Alameda Research 1.5 Million Token Sale, Will WLD Price Hold? Charles Hoskinson Defends Cardano On Thursday, Charles Hoskinson addressed the adverse response towards Cardano in an X post. Hoskinson noted that the crypto community’s sentiment about the project has lately been more negative than usual. However, he argued that Twitter’s sentiment change isn’t a reflection of the project failing “but rather the desired result of Voltaire.” Cardano’s “Voltaire” era is set to turn the network into “the most advanced blockchain governance system,” focusing on decentralized governance and its future sustainability. Hoskinson believes that Cardano’s collaborative efforts and the transparency of the network is what sets it apart from the rest of the crypto space. “It’s why we are loathed by a lot of others. Their backroom deals and dirty tricks can’t be hidden because there is no one to ask to do it under the table,” he added. In the post, the project’s founder also underscored Cardano’s “passion” for integrity and long-term vision for growth and progress: Short-term thinking, market manipulation, and companies seeking a handout have no role or place here. That’s the difference that makes a difference. Lastly, Hoskinson remarked that the project is not dying but “thriving and growing.” He that ADA is one of the last cryptocurrencies still wanting to be a real crypto instead of “the patron of Blackrock and Wall Street for number go up preferences.” ADA Could See A 10% Drop Soon The crypto community reacted to Hoskinson’s message, with many arguing that, regardless of the developments, the Network’s “lack of volume” and “limited” ecosystem growth remains a problem for its community. Meanwhile, part of ADA’s community agreed with Hoskinson, concurring that “it is the only chain that has truly built what I can only see as the groundwork to deliver on the promise of crypto.” Despite the ongoing criticism, some market watchers remain bullish about ADA’s future price action. Crypto analyst Dan Gambardello recently predicted that the cryptocurrency will “easily” reclaim the $1 mark before year’s end. To Gambardello, the exponential surge “could happen fast” and leave many “flabbergasted.” Additionally, he stated that after the 200% surge, ADA’s potential targets of $5 and $10 would “look more realistic.” Related Reading: Experts Discuss What Made Solana Memecoins The Cycle’s Top Narrative Conversely, crypto analyst Sebastian warned about a key level to watch for following ADA’s recent performance. Earlier this week, the analyst highlighted that ADA showed signs of a breakout after retesting the trendline it had recently broken above $0.35. However, the cryptocurrency’s price dropped 2.9% in the last 24 hours, falling below the $0.34 mark. The analyst signaled that ADA must hold the current levels as failing to bounce from the $0.335 level could send the token to a retest of the $0.30 support level. As of this writing, ADA is trading at $0.337, a 1.95% and 2% decline in the weekly and monthly timeframes.

The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5360 and $0.5450 resistance levels. XRP price is slowly moving higher above the $0.5320 support. The price is now trading above $0.5340 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.5360 and $0.5450 resistance levels. XRP Price Aims Higher XRP price remained stable above the $0.5220 support, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum. A base was formed and the price started a fresh increase above $0.5350. There was a test of the $0.5450 resistance before the price dipped back to $0.5240. A low was formed at $0.5239 and the price is again rising. There was an increase within a range and the price climbed above the $0.5320 resistance. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.5439 swing high to the $0.5239 low. The price is now trading above $0.5320 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $0.5280 on the hourly chart of the XRP/USD pair. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $0.5360 level. It is close to the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $0.5439 swing high to the $0.5239 low. The first major resistance is near the $0.5420 level. The next key resistance could be $0.5450. A clear move above the $0.5450 resistance might send the price toward the $0.5500 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.5680 resistance or even $0.5750 in the near term. The next major hurdle might be $0.600. Another Decline? If XRP fails to clear the $0.5360 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5285 level. The next major support is near the $0.5240 level. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5220 level, the price might continue to decline toward the $0.5120 support in the near term. The next major support sits near the $0.5050 zone. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now above the 50 level.

Top Analyst Predicts What’s Next For Crypto,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/is-the-bitcoin-bull-run-over-top-analyst/,"Crypto analyst Bob Loukas has released a new video analysis titled “No Bull.” In the video, Loukas delves into the current state of the Bitcoin market, addressing growing concerns about the possibility of a canceled bull run. Loukas begins by acknowledging the prolonged period of consolidation for the Bitcoin price. He senses that “there is now some fear creeping into the market,” partly due to factors such as the Bitcoin ETF being “out for quite some time” and the halving having “come and go,” without leading to significant upward price movement. Is The Bitcoin Bull Run Over? Loukas observes that while traditional markets are performing robustly—with “the stock market making all-time highs seemingly every week” and “even gold making big all-time highs”—Bitcoin continues to “languish,” and altcoins are “pretty much dying a slow death.” He notes that “the only thing out there that’s really working is the really speculative memecoins,” contributing to negative sentiment in the crypto space. However, he considers this development to be “kind of normal,” emphasizing that despite these challenges, Bitcoin remains “close to the all-time highs from the prior cycle.” Discussing the eight months of consolidation in Bitcoin’s price, Loukas interprets this period as a bullish sign. “Eight months of consolidation is actually pretty bullish if the timing is right in the four-year cycle. Sentiment is right, it’s been reset; fundamentals, macro, I think they all look right,” he states. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s Path To $80,000 “Melt-Up” In Q4 2024 – Details Inside Loukas further highlights that the market is “23 months in” since the lows of the last cycle in November 2022, “just shy of a 24-month or 2-year anniversary of this cycle,” which is due to conclude around November-December 2026. He acknowledges the “quite a bit of fear that’s sort of crept into this market” following a “very bullish, very frothy period” from the ETF approval leak in September-October 2023 up to the peak in March 2024. One of the main fears, according to Loukas, is that Bitcoin made its last all-time high seven months ago in March, and since then, “we’ve been forming these lower highs on the monthly and also to some extent a lower low structure.” This has created anxiety among investors who “entered the market way too late, waiting for confirmation,” only to find themselves “locked out when the market went on this five straight months move,” without providing an opportunity to buy during a dip. He points out that many investors have “rolled into a bunch of altcoins in this later period that are now down 50, 60, 70%,” leading to a situation where, despite Bitcoin being “still up around 3x off the lows,” a lot of people feel they haven’t “extracted any sort of value out of this cycle” or have even “lost money over this period.” Loukas considers this scenario to be “quite normal from a cycle structure perspective.” He emphasizes that during this bullish phase, the market didn’t experience a “typical 30% decline at any given point,” with the “biggest declines” being “mostly time-based and were only around about 20% from peak to trough before making a new high.” This atypical behavior “threw a lot of people off” and “made it difficult for people to get in,” as they were “looking to buy on a dip which never really eventuated.” Loukas suggests that the current consolidation is a necessary phase to “completely reset sentiment in order to prepare for the next phase of this four-year cycle.” He finds it significant that Bitcoin is “sitting here 23 months, just around 20% or so off the all-time highs of the last four-year cycle high back in 2021,” which makes it feel “more primed for the next phase of the four-year cycle than anything else.” He also draws parallels with previous cycles, noting that from the cycle low in December 2018 to the first point where Bitcoin made a new high, “it took 23 months to get to the price four-year cycle high to exceed that.” Similar patterns were observed in earlier cycles, with timeframes of “around 25 months” and “around 22 months” to reach new all-time highs. In contrast, the current cycle achieved this milestone “in just 16 months, much sooner,” which he attributes largely to the ETF news that “forced buyers in earlier in the cycle than normal.” Loukas believes that this accelerated timeline has created a dynamic where “we now have to rotate a lot of coins,” allowing “a lot of whales, a lot of old-timers” to “unlock” and “exit and rotate,” while “institutional players, larger account players have been accumulating those coins in this period.” He views this as “a matter of time more than anything else,” interpreting the current period as a process where the market “ends up erasing all that bullish sentiment” from the previous phase, thus allowing “a complete separation from one phase of the cycle to this phase of the cycle”—essentially a “mid-cycle decline.” When Will BTC Price Break Out? Overall, Loukas remains largely optimistic: “So far in this four-year cycle, I see nothing that has changed that trajectory, nothing in the profile or the structure that tells me that this cycle is any different to the last cycles.” He cites several factors supporting his bullish outlook, including “massive inflows into Bitcoin, mostly institutional players,” and the absorption of large sell-offs by entities like “the German government” and “the US government,” which have not significantly impacted the price. Loukas emphasizes that “price is down only 20%; it’s held up well.” He also mentions that “the ETF is still there; it’s going to be pushed through the independent advisor channels,” and “the timing is there; the macro, the fundamentals are there.” Loukas is particularly excited about the cyclical patterns, noting that “the third year of each of these four cycles is where the magic happens.” He explains that “the first year surprises everybody, that makes up a lot of ground. The second year seems like it stalls because it consolidates that first year of gains. And the third year is the mania year. And right now, beginning next month, we have the mania year that is on deck.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Hope: Mt. Gox Delays Repayment Plan Until October 2025 He predicts that “within the next 90 days… we’re going to break out of this consolidating range; we’re going to break to the upside.” Once this happens, he believes Bitcoin “isn’t going to look back,” anticipating a period that “may only see one or two red monthly candles and mostly green candles.” While he refrains from providing specific price targets, he acknowledges that reaching “somewhere between $120,000 and $180,000 also seems very reasonable.” Loukas emphasizes that the focus should be on “time and sentiment,” aiming for a move “in the range where prior cycles have peaked,” which has been “very consistent at around month 35 since the last low.” This timing would place the projected peak around “October of 2025,” giving “another 12 months to an expected or projected peak.” He notes that this is not set in stone and that the peak could come “three, four, five months earlier,” as market movements “can come in many different flavors.” Turning to the immediate future, Loukas admits that the next two months are “a little murky,” with “a lot of factors still at play right now.” He brings up the upcoming US election on November 4th, mentioning that “Trump and the GOP have really been pushing crypto and Bitcoin,” and that “the market is certainly going to respond very, very favorably to an election win by the GOP purely because of their stance on crypto.” However, he clarifies that he doesn’t think “it matters one bit” who wins, as Bitcoin has thrived even when “governments have been very hostile towards it.” Loukas speculates that the market might “trend sideways into that period in November,” and that a significant move might not occur until after the election concludes. He suggests that “we still have around three to four weeks of some trending sideways action,” and he would be “highly surprised if this market can push into the $70,000s before the election here in the US.” At press time, BTC traded at $60,699.
