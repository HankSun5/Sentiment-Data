Over the past several weeks, major Ethereum holders known as whales have significantly increased their positions, indicating strong conviction in the asset‚Äôs future. These whales, each holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH, have been aggressively accumulating since mid-April, just as Ethereum‚Äôs price began a steep climb. This pattern, alongside key technical signals, is raising expectations of a longer-term bullish phase. Whale Accumulation Aligns with Price Breakouts According to analyst Crypto Rover, large Ethereum wallets added over 1.4 million ETH between mid-April and mid-May. Their holdings grew from 15.8 million to more than 17.2 million ETH. This accumulation period closely matches Ethereum‚Äôs price rally from around $1,600 to over $3,100.

But a pair of chart watchers say the pullback could be brief. According to analysis from Jake Wujastyk, the meme token is poised for a sharp climb once key levels hold. Based on reports from fellow analyst Bitcoinsensus, there‚Äôs even more upside sketched out on detailed patterns. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs $10K Rhythm: Steady Climb Signals Strong Push To $115K Chart Pattern Signals Potential Breakout Jake Wujastyk spotted a descending triangle that began forming after Dogecoin hit $0.26 on May 11. Prices swung between the upper resistance line and a lower support line, tightening the wedge. Earlier, DOGE surged 8% in a single session, pushing near the top trend line. Daily Trend Break Opportunity on $DOGE üî•#Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakoutüíπ The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation. Next‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/tykuWOfAbs ‚Äî Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) May 19, 2025 Now the coin has dipped back into the wedge, but it‚Äôs still trading between those two lines. If the pattern breaks upward, Wujastyk argues that it could set the stage for a rapid move higher. Volume hasn‚Äôt spiked yet, so the setup isn‚Äôt sealed. But the shape of the chart suggests potential for a breakout. #Dogecoin There‚Äôs no way I couldn‚Äôt take this trade with a chart that looks like this. Target is a double here around 45 cents. pic.twitter.com/HxbrFVseiv ‚Äî Jake Wujastyk (@Jake__Wujastyk) May 18, 2025 Analyst Forecasts Rapid Price Rise Based on reports, Wujastyk expects a ‚Äútwofold rally‚Äù from current levels. That means pushing from around $0.21 today to roughly $0.45. That‚Äôs about 114% higher. He‚Äôs confident there‚Äôs ‚Äúno way you won‚Äôt take a Dogecoin trade‚Äù if the chart action holds. His call comes as the token struggles this week, down 7% in one day and flirting with erasing the prior week‚Äôs gains. Wujastyk‚Äôs bullish view hinges on a bounce off the wedge‚Äôs support, followed by a strong push through resistance. If it happens, traders could see quick gains, he says. Mixed Targets Highlight Uncertainty Another voice, analyst Bitcoinsensus, sees a similar move to above $0.40 but on a slightly different pattern. He points to an inverse head‚Äëand‚Äëshoulders that formed between March and early May. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight The left shoulder came from a March 11 low at $0.14, the head from an April 7 dip to $0.13, and the right shoulder near $0.16 on May 6. After the pattern broke out, DOGE hit a trendline that‚Äôs capped gains since December‚Äôs $0.48 high. Even with a pullback from that supply zone, Bitcoinsensus says a further push could launch Dogecoin back toward $0.42‚Äì$0.43 within seven days. Those targets suggest a 100‚Äì104% jump from today‚Äôs price.

The Commission‚Äôs clarified guidance on compliance mechanisms has sparked renewed confidence among blockchain projects. This regulatory clarity comes on the heels of Asian economic hubs ramping up blockchain adoption to streamline digital identity, finance, and cross-border payments. Within this recalibrated environment, digital finance is shedding its speculative shell and moving toward practical utility. Qubetics , a fast-rising force, is redefining how digital assets interact with real-world economies. As markets reevaluate what defines a ‚Äútop crypto to buy,‚Äù tokens like Qubetics are not merely participating‚Äîthey are steering the transformation. With its distinctive application in real-world asset tokenization, Qubetics has emerged as a consistent favorite when ranking the top crypto to buy. Qubetics ($TICS) has already gained early traction for directly addressing challenges many established protocols have overlooked. These developments make Qubetics one of the top crypto to buy before the crypto presale concludes. Qubetics: Transforming Real-World Asset Tokenization at the Right Time While the market fixates on transaction speeds and DeFi interoperability, Qubetics is pioneering a more impactful frontier‚ÄîReal World Asset (RWA) Tokenization. This application enables tokenizing tangible assets like real estate, commodities, or financial instruments onto blockchain ledgers. Qubetics stands apart with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, a platform built for global businesses, professionals, and even governments seeking compliant asset digitization. Unlike generalized marketplaces, Qubetics creates a bridge between physical and digital economies. The marketplace is designed to: Enable cross-border trade settlements using tokenized invoices Allow professionals to tokenize service contracts and intellectual property Support small enterprises with compliant debt issuance through digital tokens Facilitate real estate-backed stable asset creation By streamlining tokenization through built-in regulatory protocols and an intuitive IDE (Integrated Development Environment), Qubetics makes complex processes accessible to non-technical entities. This leap positions it as the top crypto to buy for those seeking tokenomics rooted in practical value. Qubetics Token Stats Stage: 35th of the ongoing crypto presale Price: $0.2785 per $TICS Total Tokens Sold: 513M+ Holders: 26,700+ Capital Raised: $17.1M+ Analyst ROI Projections $TICS at $1 post-presale = 258% ROI $TICS at $5 = 1694% ROI $TICS at $15 after mainnet launch = 5284% ROI Without relying on speculation, the growth narrative around Qubetics is underpinned by its ongoing adoption, strong economic model, and increasing relevance in global tokenization policy discussions. Aptos to Host Global Pizza Party Meetup in Palo Alto on May 23 to Celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day Aptos, the high-performance Layer 1 blockchain known for its security and scalability, will co-host a meetup with OnePiece Labs in Palo Alto on May 23, 2025, to celebrate the fifth annual Global Pizza Party by PizzaDAO and mark the anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day. This event brings together Web3 developers, enthusiasts, and entrepreneurs, highlighting Aptos‚Äô commitment to fostering blockchain innovation and community. Powered by its Move programming language and modular transaction processing model, Aptos continues to push the limits of throughput, transparency, and user safety on the decentralized frontier. Tron Coin Breakout? Whale Activity Explodes After Golden Cross Tron (TRX) has rallied 11% since the golden cross on, where the SMA50 overtook the SMA100, signaling a bullish shift after January‚Äôs bearish death cross. Whale activity surged early May as $1M+ TRX transactions peaked between 07:00‚Äì15:00 UTC‚Äîprime global market hours‚Äîbefore easing off, hinting at a growing influence from retail traders. Despite reduced whale dominance, TRX continues climbing, hovering around $0.27 with strong support at $0.23. However, momentum indicators suggest overbought conditions, raising the potential for a short-term pullback if price dips below the $0.24‚Äì$0.25 range. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: Why It Matters in 2025 The transition from speculative cryptocurrencies to tangible digital assets is accelerating. The Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace is central to this shift. Here‚Äôs why: Asset Liquidity: Real estate, fine art, or debt instruments become instantly tradable Regulatory Alignment: Platforms like Qubetics implement compliance-first token design Economic Access: Enables small and mid-size businesses to raise capital without traditional banking Ownership Proof: Digitally notarized contracts increase legal enforceability Programmability: Smart contracts automate dividend payouts and usage rights With $17.1M raised and over 513M $TICS sold, Qubetics is actively proving that tokenized ownership has moved from theory to implementation. This positions it not just as another blockchain startup, but as a foundational layer for the next stage in global finance. Conclusion: Why These Three Are the Top Crypto to Buy in 2025 From Qubetics‚Äô powerful asset tokenization infrastructure to Aptos blockchain ecosystem and Tron‚Äôs mass-market adoption success, these three projects address different layers of blockchain‚Äôs evolution. Their updates, strategic rollouts, and growing traction across sectors reinforce their place as the top crypto to buy in 2025. As blockchain technology enters a new utility-driven era, projects like Qubetics, Aptos, and Tron offer unique propositions tailored to emerging real-world needs.

Per the Russian media outlet RBC , the claim came from Olga Tisen, head of the legal department of the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring (Rosfinmonitoring). Warning for Russians: Crypto Exchanges Are Working With Police Tisen was speaking at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum, currently underway at the city‚Äôs ExpoForum Convention and Exhibition Center. Tisen said that the ‚Äúanonymity of crypto transfers is a myth.‚Äù She claimed that even though Russia has yet to regulate crypto exchanges and brokers, platform operators ‚Äúdisclose all data on the owners of crypto wallets at the request of law enforcement agencies.‚Äù The ExpoForum Convention and Exhibition Centre, St. Petersburg. (Source: Ekatekat [CC BY-SA 4.0]) In many other countries, regulation requires crypto exchanges to flag suspicious-looking transactions and report these to anti-money laundering agencies. However, in Russia, crypto exchanges have no legal status and are almost completely unregulated. But Tisen suggested that exchanges are pre-empting future efforts to police the sector. As such, she said, they are ‚Äúopenly admitting‚Äù to sending customer information ‚Äúat the request of law enforcement and government agencies.‚Äù Tisen added that police do not even need court orders to obtain crypto exchange customer data, ‚Äúsince cryptocurrency transactions are not subject to banking privacy protocols.‚Äù The Rosfinmonitoring executive added that ‚Äúall crypto platforms with offices in Russia‚Äù currently ‚Äúinteract with the authorities.‚Äù Tisen added that many platforms openly state on their websites that they interact with Russian law enforcement agencies. She added that this practice ‚Äúcomplies with international standards.‚Äù In addition, Rosfinmonitoring says that it receives data from banks on crypto transactions.

33767162,[object Object],1747783843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Bitcoin LTH Distribution Not Over Yet ‚Äì Can Institutions Absorb The Remaining Supply?,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-lth-distribution-not-over-yet-can-institutions-absorb-the-remaining-supply/,"Bitcoin spiked to $107,000 on Sunday before swiftly retracing, shaking investor confidence and triggering fresh volatility across the market. The move, which many hoped would lead to a clean breakout into price discovery, instead reinforced the current consolidation range between $100K and $105K. Analysts remain divided ‚Äî some see this as a healthy pause before a bigger push, while others warn of a deeper correction if BTC loses the $100K support. As the market digests this pullback, on-chain data adds an important layer to the story. According to CryptoQuant, the supply held by Long-Term Holders (defined as wallets holding BTC for 18 months to 3 years) has dropped by over 2 million BTC since November 2023. This massive distribution wave suggests long-term participants have been gradually taking profits as prices climbed to new highs. While this doesn‚Äôt guarantee a crash, it does highlight the need for strong demand from new entrants, such as institutions, to absorb the selling pressure. With price coiling above $100K and major resistance looming near ATH, the next decisive move could set the tone for Bitcoin‚Äôs trajectory heading into the summer. Long-Term Holders Step Back As Bitcoin Fights For Momentum Bitcoin is now at a make-or-break level, as bulls aim to defend the crucial $100,000 support zone. Following Sunday‚Äôs failed breakout at $107,000, the price has pulled back into familiar territory, frustrating investors who anticipated a move into price discovery. While some see this as a normal consolidation before the next leg up, others fear a deeper retrace may be underway if BTC loses the $100K floor. The market faces clear resistance between $105K and the all-time high near $109K ‚Äî a liquidity zone that could trigger aggressive buying if broken. However, the recent rejection suggests sellers still hold influence at higher levels, and short-term volatility could increase as the tug-of-war between bulls and bears intensifies. Adding to this uncertainty is long-term holder behavior. Analyst Axel Adler revealed that since November 2023, wallets holding BTC between 18 months and 3 years have offloaded over 2 million BTC ‚Äî roughly $138 billion worth. This massive distribution wave likely fueled much of the recent rally, but it also raises concerns. Adler notes that this cohort still holds about 500,000 BTC that could be sold later this year, potentially adding pressure during moments of weakness. While institutional demand might absorb some of this future supply, with the corporate sector showing renewed interest, the broader market must remain cautious. As price consolidates, investor sentiment hangs in the balance. Whether bulls reclaim higher levels or a deeper correction unfolds will depend on how Bitcoin responds to the current stress test at $100K. Price Action Details: Bulls Attempt To Reclaim Momentum Bitcoin is showing signs of renewed strength as it trades at $105,389, attempting to break above recent resistance near the $106K‚Äì$107K zone. This level has capped previous rallies, and reclaiming it would signal a bullish continuation toward all-time highs. The price has successfully defended the $100K psychological support, which now acts as a strong demand zone, reinforced by the 200-day SMA currently around $92,994 and the 200-day EMA near $88,664. Volume appears to be tapering off slightly compared to the surge earlier this month, suggesting some hesitation among bulls. However, the structure remains intact: a strong breakout from April lows has created a steep and well-defined uptrend. The consolidation just below resistance could form a bullish flag if the $107K ceiling is broken with strong volume. A failed attempt to hold above $103,600 could invite another retest of the $100K support, where bulls must hold the line to prevent deeper retracements. On the upside, clearing $107K opens the path to $109K and into price discovery. This week‚Äôs close will be critical ‚Äî a strong candle above $106K could set the tone for the next macro leg higher.

Investors are keen to identify which of these digital assets might be on the brink of skyrocketing. This article delves into the specific coins that are poised for substantial growth, offering insights into the potential opportunities ahead. EOS Market Update: Month Surge and Six-Month Gains Amid Week Dip EOS price action over the last month recorded a 22.15% rise, while the six-month change reached 24.77%, indicating a steady upward trend despite notable short-term fluctuations. The recent weekly drop of 11.63% highlights the coin‚Äôs characteristic volatility, combining periods of strength with occasional setbacks, as shown in its broader performance history. At present, the coin trades between a support level at $0.41 and a resistance level at $1.01, with a broader range from $0.11 to $1.32 also in view. Indicators such as an RSI near 50 suggest neutrality, while mixed oscillator signals indicate caution. Bulls are present, but recent dips warrant trading ideas focused on short-term consolidation within these key levels. Toncoin: Past Trends and Current Opportunities Over the past month, Toncoin experienced a modest gain of nearly 3%, while the past six months showed a significant decline of around 42%. The price movements illustrate a pattern of volatility, with short-term gains failing to compensate for larger losses. This behavior reflects broader market uncertainties and the reactions of investors to external factors, leading to fluctuating sentiment. TON currently trades between $2.55 and $3.99, facing immediate resistance near $4.82 and a support level around $1.94. Recent activity indicates bears are in control, highlighted by a weekly drop of 8.79% and negative momentum indicators. Without a clear long-term trend, traders may consider opportunities between these key levels while remaining cautious of potential downward movements. Raydium Price Snapshot: Mixed Trends and Key Levels in Focus Raydium experienced a 44.13% gain over the past month alongside a 43.62% drop over the last six months. Price activity has been volatile, reflecting rapid rallies and deeper corrections. The past month has shown strong upward movement while the half-year performance highlights significant pullbacks. Trading sentiment has shifted quickly, revealing a market characterized by both aggressive buying and selling phases. Raydium currently trades between $1.73 and $3.50, with resistance at $4.21 and support at $0.68. Price action indicates balanced pressure with hints of bullish strength recently, though the trend remains unclear. Traders might consider entering near support and watching for rejection at resistance to guide short-term decisions. Conclusion EOS , TON , and RAY are showing strong signs of growth. Each offers unique features and benefits. EOS stands out with its quick transaction speeds. TON provides impressive security and privacy. RAY excels with its staking rewards. These coins are gaining serious traction in the market. Staying informed on their progress may be beneficial. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

April tariffs triggered global market losses and sharp price increases in US consumer goods. Core inflation eased slightly, but financial analysts and lawmakers warn of long-term economic risks. President Donald Trump claimed the U.S. economy is ‚Äúroaring,‚Äù citing March‚Äôs addition of 228,000 jobs.

In a world rapidly reshaped by artificial intelligence, few think as personally about its impact as Manit Parikh. As the Founder of The Binary Holdings , Manit is at the forefront of building digital infrastructure that blends the best of Web2 and Web3 while embedding AI deeply into product design and user experience. Rather than generic chatbots, TBH's vision is for AI companions to learn each user's tastes, routines, and even moods. This ambition echoes a broader tech trend: one analyst predicts that by 2025, our smartphones will function as full-fledged AI assistants, able to perform complex tasks on our behalf and operate like personal assistants in our pockets.Parikh says TBH will deliver that future in emerging markets by blending AI with the company's vast Web3 distribution network. We sat down with Manit to explore his journey, the genesis of Binary Holdings, and how his team uses AI to create hyperpersonalized, behavior-driven platforms that could redefine digital interaction. Q: Can you share a quick background about yourself and what you've been up to lately? Manit: Thank you so much for having me. I'm an economist and lawyer by education‚Äîturned investment banker, consultant, and entrepreneur. I started Binary Holdings in August 2020. COVID had just hit, my daughter had just been born, and like many people, I was forced into a digital-first life. That's when I decided to channel all the product-building skills I'd picked up over the years and turn my vision into something tangible. Q: Tell us more about Binary Holdings. What was the starting point, and how has it evolved? Manit: Binary Holdings started with a product called Fando‚Äîour OG. It was like TikTok meets Twitter, but designed for sports fans with a loyalty program and marketplace built in. We weren't just building a platform; we were building an economy where users could earn value by engaging. As we grew, Fando became just one part of a larger vision. Today, Binary Holdings is an infrastructure company at the intersection of Web2 and Web3, primarily mobile networks and financial services. We're building verticals that can scale across ecosystems. Q: You've been actively building in AI. Where do you see AI's role in our everyday lives right now? Manit: AI is already embedded in how we live. Think about how we used to use Google‚Äîsifting through thousands of results. Now, a single AI response can give you what you need. Whether you're a student, entrepreneur, or creative, we all use AI, from brainstorming to automating personal tasks. Today, maybe AI handles 20% of our digital workload. In five years, it'll be closer to 60‚Äì70%. Q: Let's talk about your AI companion. You mentioned it's central to your roadmap. Can you elaborate? Manit: Absolutely. We've created a voice-based AI companion that doesn't feel robotic; it's conversational and context-aware. Unlike static voice AIs, we aim to make it feel like a real assistant. It's voice-based, context-aware, and emotionally intelligent. It adapts based on your tone, mood, and preferences. It can play multiple roles‚Äîa therapist, a tutor, a friend, a co-pilot. Take mental health. In the West, you go to therapy. In much of Asia, it's taboo. But what if you could talk to an AI that listens, understands your emotional state, and helps you process your thoughts? We're not trying to replace professionals; instead, we're augmenting the support system. Q: As a builder in the Web3 and AI space, how do you stay ahead of the curve? Manit: I'm not an engineer, but I understand financial and business models. That allows me to integrate AI strategically. We collect massive amounts of behavioral data, not personal data, due to GDPR, but enough to understand patterns. We then use AI to create upstream and downstream' mind maps' of user personas. For example, if you're a fan of LeBron James, we map all related content and products into your digital journey. It's like building an AI around your interests, behavior, and ecosystem. Q: That sounds like serious personalization. Why is hyperpersonalization such a big deal? Manit: Discoverability is the biggest pain point in digital platforms. We can remove that friction by using AI to dynamically change what you see based on your behavior. So instead of you searching, the right product or content finds you. Your screen becomes your mirror. Every time you come back, it's slightly more tuned to you. That's what increases engagement and retention. He chuckles, I genuinely believe we're heading to a point where AI could even know when you're hungry based on patterns, location data, and daily habits. That's where hyperpersonalization is going. Q: What tangible results have you seen from hyperpersonalization so far? Manit: It's incredible that the average time spent on our platforms increased from two or three minutes to almost 10 to 12 minutes daily because of personalization. That's nine additional minutes of engagement. Because people consume more content, they burn through mobile data faster. This means they recharge their plans more frequently, three to four times a month instead of once or twice. This directly translates to increased average revenue per user (ARPU) for our telco and data partners. So now, the partnership makes business sense; it's no longer just a cool tech demo; more so, it's real ROI. Q: What does this mean for users in emerging markets? Manit: Most of our users come from underdeveloped or emerging economies‚Äîmiddle and lower-income groups that make up about 90% of the population. For them, the value they earn through our platforms can feel like a secondary income stream. We take things like going out for dinner or a movie for granted, but for some families, this is a real financial boost. It empowers the already empowered, but more importantly, it uplifts those who live hand-to-mouth. That's meaningful. Q: What are the most untapped opportunities for enterprises with AI right now? Manit: There are three big ones. First, they have their internal data. Many enterprises collect data but don't structure it in sandboxes to study behavior. That's a missed opportunity. Second, AI can help forecast the next five years of their business. It can generate strategic product ideas or analyze competitors, giving product managers a head start and saving the company from investing time and capital in dead ends. Third is true hyper-personalization. Let's take gaming. You buy FIFA, and a million people play the same game. But your PlayStation knows how you play. Why doesn't it adapt the gameplay accordingly? If I'm getting better, the AI should level up, too. This not only enhances user experience but also boosts retention and in-game monetization. Q: AI is powerful but also complex. Given the bureaucratic hurdles enterprises face, how do you see them adopting it? Manit: Great question. Enterprises have their plates full with budget cycles, approvals, and public company disclosures. AI becomes another challenge to stack on top. So when we approach them, we don't ask them to change their entire system. We start a parallel thread about a small integration that proves our value. Then, slowly, they come to us asking what else we can help with. Over 12 to 36 months, our tools become embedded into 95% of their operations, including AI, ML, and automation, all without disrupting their existing ecosystem. Q: With so much happening in AI, what excites you most about the future of AI-native products? Manit: I always say, the AI market isn't a pond‚Äîit's the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans combined. What we're seeing now is just scratching the surface. One use case is driving. Say you're on a night drive and tired. The AI companion activates. You choose your mood: 'educational,' ‚Äòbusiness,' or just 'talk.' Maybe you decide to learn a new language during your commute. Since the AI retains your context and adapts, it's far better than static apps. It's a therapist, a study buddy, and a voice coach‚Äîall in one. But with that growth will come consolidation. We're in a collaborative economy now, not a monopolistic one. If we don't collaborate, we'll all get pulled back. And as AI becomes mainstream, it'll attract regulation, just like crypto did. Regulation will separate the real players from the opportunistic ones. Those who build compliant, ethical AI will scale. The rest? They'll fade. As the digital world leans ever more into AI, Manit Parikh and Binary Holdings are not just following trends but shaping them. With personalization as their north star and infrastructure as their foundation, their vision offers a glimpse into what the next generation of platforms could look like, including intuitive, adaptive, and deeply human.

LINK price has recorded a high correlation with Bitcoin price YTD, which is almost entering a parabolic bullish phase. The gradual Bitcoin (BTC) price rise in the past few weeks, has significantly influenced the wider altcoin market led by Chainlink (LINK). The highly anticipated crypto summer of 2025 has seen the overall capital inflow to the altcoin market experience a sharp uptick. Moreover, an imminent reversal and fall of Bitcoin dominance in the coming months will trigger a sustained altseason, fueled by FOMO traders. Chainlink Network Growth Outlook The Chainlink network has received significant adoption in the past few months amid the mainstream adoption of digital assets and web3 protocols. Furthermore, the Chainlink network enables DeFi protocols to provide reliable services in an interoperable ecosystem. Earlier this week, the Chainlink network announced a strategic integration with the Solana (SOL) network to enable its DeFi ecosystem to access Chainlink‚Äôs CCIP infrastructure.¬†On Tuesday, several DeFi protocols announced a strategic integration with the Chainlink network to access its CCIP infrastructure. Some of the notable integrations include Zeus Network, Liquity Protocol, and Shift RWA. The continued adoption of the Chainlink products by institutional investors has bolstered the LINK token, which is used to reward node operators and data providers. Midterm Targets for LINK Price The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $15.7 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $604 million, has been attempting to recover from last week‚Äôs 10 per decline. In the daily timeframe, LINK price has established a rising trend since April 9, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. Moreover, the LINK price has already broken out and retested a falling wedge pattern established in the first quarter of 2025. In the four-hour timeframe, LINK price has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, coupled with a rising divergence of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) . As a result, LINK price is well positioned to rally towards the next short term target around $19.8.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|LINK|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 23:52:27

But while these large-caps fight for renewed upside, one emerging name is gaining traction among serious traders: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Without needing flashy announcements or trend cycles, it‚Äôs steadily cementing itself as one of the most talked-about contenders in the 2025 lineup ‚Äî and buyers are beginning to realize that this project is built to lead, not chase. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Bold Positioning, Relentless Confidence, and Real Market Presence MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising for one clear reason ‚Äî it refuses to play small. In a sea of short-term meme projects and recycled narratives, this coin is commanding attention through consistent strength, focused branding, and clear long-term potential. Analysts are watching closely as sentiment consolidates around what many now view as a high-conviction opportunity for early entry . It is not just hype ‚Äî it is becoming a headline project with all the traits of a breakout altcoin designed for this cycle, not the last one. Cardano (ADA): Whale Activity and Airdrops Keep Bulls in Control Cardano is showing solid structure on higher timeframes, fueled by whale buying and new layer integrations. With ADA hovering just below key resistance, analysts are forecasting a breakout toward $1.32 ‚Äî assuming the recent momentum continues. Speculation around the upcoming Midnight airdrop is also fueling accumulation. If ADA clears the $0.80 barrier, upside movement could accelerate heading into June. Sui (SUI): Technical Breakout in Play With Strong Ecosystem Support SUI remains a trader favorite in the Layer-1 space, offering clean structure and growing DeFi traction. The token is consolidating near recent highs and is flashing early breakout signals, with analyst targets ranging from $6 to $7.70 . Sui‚Äôs ability to sustain user activity while attracting new DEX protocols makes it one of the more structurally solid plays heading into the second half of Q2. Polkadot (DOT): Undervalued Performer With Cross-Chain Advantage DOT is quietly climbing back into view, with multi-chain interoperability and renewed builder interest supporting its rise. Currently trending under key resistance, price targets for this quarter range from $1.05 to $1.30 . If market sentiment shifts in favor of legacy Layer-1s, DOT could reprice quickly ‚Äî especially with increased attention on cross-chain infrastructure and parachain expansion. Final Thoughts Cardano is climbing on whales and incentives. Sui is technically primed and DeFi-proven. Polkadot is setting up as the quiet Layer-1 rotation pick. But while all three fight to reclaim past highs, MAGACOIN FINANCE is defining its own lane ‚Äî and rapidly becoming one of the most confident altcoin bets of the year . In a market overflowing with short-lived speculation, this project is shaping up to be the coin built for staying power ‚Äî and more investors are beginning to treat it that way.

While established players like Monero (XMR) keep their privacy edge and meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) catch attention with quick price surges, newer projects are focused on creating lasting value. Web3 ai stands apart by offering a clear, structured roadmap for growth, aligning product development with investor opportunities. With upcoming releases for AI tools, mobile integration, and exchange listings, Web3 ai offers something unique. For those on the lookout for high-return crypto investments, this project presents an exciting, timely opportunity. What Could Push Web3 ai to the $1 Mark? Web3 ai is quickly becoming a top contender for the best crypto investment in 2025, and its momentum is impossible to ignore. With more than $4.3 million raised in just a matter of days, it‚Äôs clear that investors are already catching on. Currently in presale stage 5 at $0.000365 per token, the presale price will soon rise to $0.005242, meaning early investors could see returns of up to 1,747% before $WAI even hits public exchanges. What‚Äôs fueling the buzz? It‚Äôs not just the numbers, it‚Äôs the impressive roadmap Web3 ai has laid out. The team is rolling out a suite of powerful tools, including an AI trading assistant, ROI prediction engine, staking dashboards, and cross-platform API integrations. Plus, a mobile app is already in the works and is set for release just months after launch. But that‚Äôs not all, wallet and social media integrations, developer SDK access, and even plans for centralised exchange listings are on the horizon. As each milestone is hit, the demand for $WAI only grows, driving up the token‚Äôs utility and value. With a capped supply and a rapidly climbing presale price, the window of opportunity is shrinking fast. For those who want to maximise returns in 2025, now is the time to act before this presale phase ends. Monero‚Äôs Unmatched Privacy: A 2025 Standout Monero (XMR) continues to lead the charge when it comes to privacy in the crypto space. Thanks to its use of ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions, Monero ensures total anonymity for users, from who‚Äôs sending the funds to who‚Äôs receiving them, and even the transaction amounts. This unwavering commitment to privacy has earned Monero a strong following among those who prioritise financial confidentiality. As concerns around surveillance and financial tracking continue to rise, Monero‚Äôs privacy-first approach is more relevant than ever. It‚Äôs not just about concealing identities; it‚Äôs about making it nearly impossible to trace any transactions. This has kept the interest high among users who want complete control over their financial history. With the growing importance of data protection, Monero‚Äôs privacy isn‚Äôt just an added feature; it‚Äôs a core principle driving its adoption. While other projects dabble with partial privacy, Monero delivers full anonymity by default, giving users exactly what they want: total transactional privacy. What‚Äôs Next After SHIB‚Äôs Gain? Shiba Inu (SHIB) recorded an impressive 14.48% jump this week, marking its best performance since late 2024. This surge came after a period of consolidation where SHIB found solid support at the $0.00001107 level. As buyers regained confidence, momentum picked up, and the token ended the week around $0.00001417. This upward trend indicates a shift in market sentiment and growing interest from investors. However, despite this recent gain, SHIB is still below its previous peak of $0.0000297, leaving plenty of room for potential growth. The next key resistance level to watch is around $0.00001698, which traders are eyeing closely. If SHIB can maintain this momentum, with rising trading volume and continued buyer interest, there‚Äôs a real chance the token could build on this positive trend in the coming weeks. All signs point to a recovery, and SHIB‚Äôs potential for further gains remains strong. Final Thoughts In a crypto landscape where trends come and go, true progress stands out. Monero (XMR) maintains its dominance in privacy, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) shows how market sentiment can fuel huge gains. But Web3 ai is carving its path, offering a solid, utility-driven roadmap with clear milestones. With a range of AI tools, a mobile app launch, and potential exchange listings lined up, Web3 ai is building a strong foundation before any major price jumps. As the AI crypto presale phases wind down and development picks up speed, it‚Äôs not just about speculation, it‚Äôs about tangible progress. For those aiming for top returns, catching this growth at the right time could be key.

Notably, this marks the second time Bitcoin has rejected around $107,000 in the past few days. Despite this volatility, Bitcoin managed to close last week‚Äôs candle above a key resistance level that had capped its price action for weeks. This close, recorded just above the red horizontal line at $103,000, has introduced confidence in the continuation of the uptrend, and points to the bulls still in control of Bitcoin‚Äôs price action. Bitcoin Weekly Closes Above Range ‚Äì First Bullish Step Current Bitcoin price action shows that bullish investors and buyers are still controlling the momentum behind the largest cryptocurrency and, in essence, the rest of the crypto market. Notably, Bitcoin initially experienced a brief surge to nearly $107,000 over the weekend before retreating. Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Trend Oscillator Shows When To Expect The Price Top This price movement was followed by a dip to around $102,000, with the back-and-forth most likely being influenced by factors such as Moody‚Äôs downgrade of U.S. debt and investor reactions to potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, in an interesting note, the BTC price managed to close above the $103,000 range during this first move to $107,000, which is very important in terms of technical analysis going forward. This sentiment is echoed by crypto analyst Rekt Capital on social media platform X, who pointed out the next step that might play out for Bitcoin. Post-Breakout Retest Underway, Says Rekt Capital The $104,000 price level had previously acted as a stubborn ceiling throughout much of the recent Bitcoin price consolidation between $102,000 and $104,000 since May 9. However, since breaking above this level, the ensuing price action has seen the Bitcoin price retracing towards this level after another rejection at $107,000. Related Reading: Golden Ratio Multiplier Called Bitcoin Top In 2021 ‚Äì Here‚Äôs What It‚Äôs Saying Now According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, the dip following the $107,000 rejection isn‚Äôt necessarily bearish. Instead, it could be part of a post-breakout retest, a pattern often seen in strong bullish structures. If this retest successfully confirms the former resistance as new support, BTC¬†could set the stage for a breakout into fresh all-time highs. As shown in the 1W Bitcoin price chart above, the red resistance level is very close to Bitcoin‚Äôs January 2025 all-time high around $108,780. Furthermore, the chart shows that the recent breakout above the $90,000‚Äì$103,000 zone appears to mirror a pattern of Bitcoin‚Äôs breakout after a consolidation move, after another bounce from a low. In this case, the bounce occurred at the $75,000 low in early April. If Bitcoin does rebound with enough trading volume around $104,000, this could provide the much-needed momentum for a move above $107,000 and finally above $108,700 again. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,555, up by 2.9% in the past 24 hours.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin appears to be forming a bearish divergence on the daily chart. The bearish reversal signal suggests that bullish momentum is waning even though an asset‚Äôs price is moving higher or sideways. Says Bluntz, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a daily BTC bear div brewing here if it closes red by [today]. It‚Äôs unfortunate that it has appeared before fresh all-time highs, but it‚Äôs the first one since last year. Be careful with longs in my opinion.‚Äù Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,546. Turning to gold, the analyst believes that the precious metal is poised to ignite a rally to a new all-time high after completing an ABC corrective wave. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states a bullish asset will continue its uptrend after an ABC correction. The trader shares a chart suggesting that gold will rally to a new record high of $3,600. ‚ÄúGold gathering steam for the next leg up here.‚Äù Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, gold is worth $3,221. As for the memecoin Floki ( FLOKI ), Bluntz predicts that the altcoin would dip to around $0.00008 before exploding to $0.00018. ‚ÄúLooks like FLOKI is one of the few memes with a clear impulse five-wave rise from the lows on the daily, indicating the low is in.

While BTC dominates the headlines, the real growth potential often lies in low-to-mid-cap projects primed to outperform as capital rotates outward.From established names like XRP and Ethereum to surging contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Aptos, a handful of strategic plays are positioning themselves for outsized gains as institutional inflows rise and market sentiment strengthens. Here are four breakout candidates that could capture serious momentum in Bitcoin‚Äôs shadow. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming the #1 Choice in 2025 SMART MONEY IS LOADING UP ‚Äì ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining recognition as a highly asymmetric early-stage opportunity. Still trading under $0.07, the project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 now live and buy activity surging. MAGA‚Äôs $0.007 listing target and scarcity-driven tokenomics have analysts calling for 34x‚Äì40x returns‚Äîand some models point to even more extreme upside if current momentum continuesWhat sets MAGA apart is not just its viral political narrative, but its transparent tokenomics, Hashex audit, and a presale structure that‚Äôs attracting both retail and whale capital. As Stage 8 nears completion, traders are calling this a rare chance to secure early exposure before MAGACOIN FINANCE hits exchanges . In a market searching for the next SHIBA or DOGE, MAGA‚Äôs combination of community energy, clear roadmap, and realistic price targets puts it at the top of many watchlists. Solana‚Äôs Technical Setup and Whale Accumulation Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $171.54, consolidating within a strong support and resistance range between $158 and $175. Analysts highlight a long-term Cup and Handle pattern forming, with a breakout above $175 potentially opening the door to $183 and beyond. SOL‚Äôs fundamentals remain robust, and smart money continues to accumulate, but as capital rotates, many investors are also looking to early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper growth while SOL trades sideways. Ethereum‚Äôs Bullish Breakout and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,531.95, up sharply from $1,800 at the start of May and now at a two-month high. Technical indicators remain bullish, with ETH above its 50-day EMA and forming a classic bull flag pattern.If ETH can break above $2,700, analysts see a move to $2,750‚Äì$2,900 in May and a year-end target between $4,392 and $5,925. As Ethereum‚Äôs rally matures, some investors are rotating capital into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater upside potential. Aptos: Quiet Accumulation and Upside Potential Aptos (APT) is consolidating after a recent event-driven rally, with analysts forecasting a price range of $5.13 to $8.81 for May 2025. While APT‚Äôs tech-first approach has strong backing, some early investors are rotating out profits in favor of lower-cap exposure.MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefitting from that shift, with many short-term speculators taking gains from APT and placing them into MAGA, where exponential upside still remains. XRP‚Äôs Futures Launch and the $100 Question XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts watching closely as the CME Futures launch and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. Legal clarity in the U.S. and growing payment adoption have analysts forecasting a move beyond $5 in the short term, with $15‚Äì$30 possible if key catalysts align.While a $100 price remains a stretch, the infrastructure being built by Ethereum, Solana, and new contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the real drivers of the next major run. JOIN NOW ‚Äî $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion With Bitcoin setting the tone for a powerful 2025, the spotlight is shifting to altcoins with strategic positioning and high-growth potential. Solana and XRP offer credibility and scale, while MAGACOIN FINANCE provides early entry with outsized return potential. Investors rotating now‚Äîbefore listings finalize and media attention catches up‚Äîmay be best positioned to benefit from the explosive upside that defines every crypto supercycle.

This milestone will unveil the complete lineup of 20 crypto exchanges where BDAG will debut. Originally set for 10 exchanges, the expansion to 20 signals the growing confidence in the project. Buyers now have a chance to lock in BDAG at $0.0020 before listings go live. With over $258 million raised so far, this launch could reshape the Layer-1 market. The first five listings are already public: MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. These platforms give an early glimpse of BlockDAG ‚Äôs broad market reach. The full list remains under wraps until the GO LIVE day, which adds suspense and urgency. More than just a listing event, this date marks the final chance to buy BDAG at a reduced price before its rates jump. For many, June 13 signals more than just a listing update, it‚Äôs a defining moment for 2025‚Äôs best performing crypto. BlockDAG GO LIVE Reveal: Strategic Importance of June 13 For anyone watching the crypto presale closely, June 13 holds serious weight. It marks the end of BlockDAG‚Äôs frozen pricing period at $0.0020. That fixed price offers early supporters a rare entry before listings push the coin into open market volatility. With the listing price set at $0.05, this entry window represents unmatched value. Returns since Batch 1 now sit at 2,520%, and more than 20.9 billion BDAG coins have been sold. As the current Batch 28 trades at $0.0262, the opportunity to still buy at $0.0020 before June 13 creates a notable advantage for those seeking gains on the best performing crypto of the year. This deadline is also pushing activity higher as more buyers aim to lock in their coins before the GO LIVE reveal reshapes BDAG‚Äôs pricing forever. Why This Exchange Launch Sets a New Standard Unlike typical launches, BlockDAG‚Äôs GO LIVE reveal showcases real progress, strategic alignment, and global exchange presence. With 20 confirmed exchanges, BDAG is not just appearing in the market, it‚Äôs entering with strength. Each listing brings access to broader audiences, liquidity, and exposure that many new projects never achieve this early. BlockDAG is also following through on its delivery roadmap. Miners have started receiving their X Series mining equipment orders, underlining the project‚Äôs commitment to real-world results. This kind of follow-through supports BlockDAG‚Äôs appeal as a long-term player in the space. Presale excitement continues to grow, thanks to the Buyer Battles and referral rewards program. These efforts keep the community engaged and encourage more users to participate before the deadline. As June 13 draws closer, BlockDAG looks increasingly like the best performing crypto entering the market this year. In Summary Mark June 13 on the calendar. It will be one of the most important moments of the year for anyone eyeing the best performing crypto before launch. BlockDAG‚Äôs GO LIVE reveal will confirm 20 exchange listings and finalize the $0.0020 entry price period. With over $258 million raised, over 20.9 billion coins sold, and a 2,520% ROI since Batch 1, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a standout in 2025. Once the listings are live, prices will likely react quickly. Until then, the opportunity to get in at a frozen price still stands. This is one presale that deserves full attention before June 13 resets the market dynamics.

Some are introducing new tools, expanding partnerships, or leveraging cross-chain solutions to grow their networks. These moves aren‚Äôt just about marketing hype; each coin here shows signs of actual traction. Those tracking the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025 will find this mix particularly engaging. The list features projects tied to AI, multichain access, and infrastructure development, offering a broad view of where value is forming. With Unstaked‚Äôs rollout plan, Cosmos expanding Ethereum access, and Sui bringing Bitcoin into DeFi, these assets are carving out strong narratives. Some launch major initiatives, while others aim to rebound after market dips. Every pick on this list presents a setup worth noting right now. 1. Unstaked: AI Utilities That Deliver Real Results Unstaked has been gathering momentum for its hands-on AI approach. The platform allows users to run AI agents that manage tasks like handling community posts and automating responses on Telegram and X. These aren‚Äôt inactive features; they‚Äôre judged by what they achieve, and rewards are based on their work. This system, named Proof of Intelligence, promotes active use instead of passive holding. Every interaction is stored transparently on-chain. With 60% of tokens offered publicly and no allocations for private rounds or VC parties, it gives broader access to early participants. Priced at $0.009267 in stage 13 and targeting a launch price of $0.1819, it reflects a possible ROI of 2700%. There‚Äôs also a $1 million prize pool campaign underway. Anyone purchasing at least $100 in $UNSD and completing social steps can enter to win $50,000, 20 winners in total. So far, the presale has raised $6.3 million, with $2 million collected in just two days. While some mention the platform has live agents, it‚Äôs important to clarify that these tools will only activate once the presale wraps up and the platform goes live. With a working model, strong interest, and transparent metrics, Unstaked deserves its place among the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 2. Sui: Bitcoin Utility and Expanding Features Sui has been pushing forward technically by linking Bitcoin-backed tokens into its ecosystem. Through a tie-up with Bitlayer, Peg-BTC (YBTC) can now be used within Sui‚Äôs DeFi framework, allowing BTC holders to earn through the platform. It also teamed up with 21Shares to support real-world asset applications. On top of that, Sui just crossed 8 million new wallet holders this month, which points to rising traction. With its current price near $1.85, down slightly for the day but up nearly 70% in a month, SUI still looks strong. Analysts believe the asset could move toward $6 if this pace holds. The addition of Axelar enables wider dApp development across chains. Thanks to fresh features and cross-chain potential, Sui earns a place on the list of fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 3. Cosmos (ATOM): Enhancing Access and Developer Reach Cosmos has made several updates that support adoption. It was just added to Bitbank, a top exchange in Japan, with zero trading fees during launch. That could draw new trading volume from Asia. But more importantly, Cosmos rolled out IBC v2, which improves how users and developers interact with Ethereum rollups. It makes multi-chain work smoother and cheaper, key for future growth. ATOM is priced around $4.90, with short-term charts hinting a drop toward $4.50 by May 18. However, projections for later this year point to a bounce to $6.80. With improved cross-chain tools and increased exchange access, Cosmos is set to stay on the watchlists of those looking into the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 4. Polkadot (DOT): Development Growth Despite ETF Delay Polkadot has seen mixed sentiment recently after the U.S. SEC delayed its decision on a DOT ETF proposal from 21Shares. This pause caused a slide below $5, and the price currently sits at $4.82, still struggling to break the $5.30 ceiling. Forecasts suggest a short-term dip to $4.45, with potential for a slow rise back to $5.15 later this year. But behind the scenes, development remains active. OpenZeppelin confirmed smart contract compatibility with Polkadot, which opens the door for more dApps on the chain. While prices are soft for now, continued work on developer tools helps Polkadot stay competitive. Its evolving ecosystem keeps it in talks among the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025, especially if ETF updates go positive. Final Thoughts! Momentum is forming across these projects. Sui is growing with Bitcoin integration and asset tokenisation, Cosmos is unlocking better Ethereum rollup access, and Polkadot keeps adding dev tools while waiting on ETF clarity. Yet Unstaked remains a standout, combining performance-based AI tools, a strong $6.3 million presale, and an open supply model without outside allocations. Anyone evaluating the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025 should keep these four in sight. Sui, Cosmos, and Polkadot all offer strong technical moves, while Unstaked adds an upcoming utility layer tied to real activity. With the launch still ahead, Unstaked also brings a rare entry chance before full rollout. These picks represent some of the sharpest plays in today‚Äôs market trends.

Experts warn that this blind spot could have serious consequences for Silicon Valley and the broader digital economy. Allianz Trade, an intelligence firm that tracks global trade risks, published a report on Tuesday based on a survey of 4,500 companies worldwide. It aimed to measure the impact of rising trade tensions and warned that a focus on the United States‚Äô trillion-dollar goods deficit threatens to overlook the fastest-growing part of global trade, the ‚Äúinvisible exports‚Äù of financial and digital services. Though tracking these services is challenging, the report cites estimates showing a US digital trade surplus of at least $600 billion, including digital advertising, video streaming, cloud platforms, and online payment services. Digital surplus by firm (USD bn). Source: Allianz Trade Global Survey 2025 The report calls this ‚Äúhidden trade immense‚Äù. It says these invisible exports have greatly outpaced the growth of goods exports over the past two decades, yet they do not show up in standard trade statistics. Allianz Trade warns that if Washington does not ‚Äúrethink trade policy and narratives‚Äù to begin tracking these services more closely, it could undermine one of America‚Äôs innovative companies and massive data infrastructure, just as the president is negotiating deals with much of the world. The report stresses that overlooking this trade could leave US firms exposed to foreign retaliation. Furthermore, US digital exports now make up about 3.6% of all trade worldwide and continue to grow quickly. These unseen exchanges add to US trade revenues without filling any container ships. In today‚Äôs economy, routers and data centers are as crucial as ports and factories for keeping America in a leading position. Yet, President Trump‚Äôs current plan requires countries hit by his reciprocal tariffs to strike a deal by July 8, a deadline he admits may not allow talks with every partner. US trade partners are already exploring tariffs or taxes on digital services Experts agree that if these measures become permanent, they might damage the US tech industry and even split the internet by forcing companies to tailor their services to different regions. Jovan Kurbalija, a former diplomat and head of the DiploFoundation, warned in an April blog that a shift into the digital domain could carry ‚Äúfar-reaching consequences‚Äù for Silicon Valley and the global digital economy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed to the Financial Times last month that she is planning countermeasures if talks between the European Union and the United States fail. Those could include a tax on digital advertising revenues aimed at firms like Amazon, Google, and Facebook, as well as tariffs on services traded across the entire EU market. Kurbalija said that beyond Europe, Trump‚Äôs goods tariffs give other countries both moral and tactical reasons to fast-track digital taxes under the banner of ‚Äúreclaiming revenue from foreign tech ‚Äòfree riders.‚Äô‚Äù Half of US firms considering more investment in China In an opinion piece , Neal K. Shah, CEO of CareYaya Health Technologies, warned that ‚Äútariffs on digital services would directly reduce revenues for American tech companies.‚Äù He said a full-blown digital trade war could harm the Internet‚Äôs infrastructure and force firms to operate ‚Äúparallel digital universes with incompatible standards.‚Äù Shah said that means higher costs, less market access, and slower growth for startups and innovators. He added that splitting the digital world could end globally scalable platforms, scare away investors, and cut world GDP by up to 5% over the next decade. Trump‚Äôs answer to these threats remains more tariffs. He has said that ‚Äúonly America should be allowed to tax American firms,‚Äù Reuters reported . In February, he issued a memo ordering research into how to respond to digital service taxes, including new duties. Yet Allianz Trade found that many US firms are not returning operations home. Instead, half of those surveyed are weighing increased investments in China, while only eight percent plan cuts there. Others said they are rerouting supply chains to Southeast Asia, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Latin America. Experts like Bertin Martens of the Brussels think tank Bruegel say imposing digital services tariffs is hard in practice. Laws barring measures against platforms with a significant local presence require detailed user data. Some see open-source technology as the clear winner if tariffs force firms to seek alternatives that sidestep trade barriers.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and XRP Could Lead 2025‚Äôs Political Crypto Boom",https://thecoinrise.com/500-to-7-figures-magacoin-finance-bitcoin-and-xrp-could-lead-2025s-political-crypto-boom/,"Introduction With Bitcoin regaining momentum, XRP drawing institutional flows, and Ethereum breaking out above key resistance, investors are zooming in on a select group of tokens set for major upside in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the charge‚Äînot just for its explosive growth potential, but because Stage 8 is now live and analysts are calling it a high-conviction 40x altcoin candidate. Kaspa (KAS) is also catching attention as its ecosystem expands, but the spotlight is squarely on MAGA, BTC, XRP, and ETH as the market pivots toward political and narrative-driven plays. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Coin to Watch Before Stage 9 CLICK HERE ‚Äì ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing serious attention as Stage 8 nears completion, with over $8 million raised and a hard listing target of $0.007. Unlike legacy coins where much of the upside is already priced in, MAGA offers structured scarcity, surging demand, and transparent price discovery. Analysts are projecting a 35x‚Äì40x ROI from current levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if listing momentum continues. With each stage filling rapidly and community growth accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as the final major entry before the price curve steepens and Stage 9 begins. Bitcoin: Macro Momentum and Political Narrative Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, having gained over 14% in the past 30 days and now less than 7% below the $100,000 mark. On-chain data shows demand rebounding, with major wallets accumulating as US-based ETF inflows stabilize. While institutional conviction is still ramping up, analysts see a plausible summer rally toward $150,000 if current trends hold. As the political narrative heats up in the US and abroad, Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a macro hedge and a political statement is drawing new capital‚Äîwhile early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are benefitting from this shift in sentiment. XRP: Derivatives, ETFs, and Global Settlement XRP is trading around $2.39, with forecasts for late 2025 targeting $2.65‚Äì$2.80 if current momentum holds. The launch of CME futures and growing ETF speculation are fueling institutional interest, while whale accumulation continues to rise. Legal clarity and Ripple‚Äôs expanding partnerships are setting the stage for XRP to serve as a global settlement infrastructure asset. As institutional flows grow, many investors are also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater upside. Kaspa: Technical Strength and Ecosystem Growth Kaspa (KAS) is trading at $0.097, showing resilience after its recent hard fork and ecosystem expansion. Analysts predict moderate gains this year, with a possible move to $0.15 if broader market conditions remain favorable. Kaspa‚Äôs unique blockDAG architecture and active developer community are positioning it as a standout proof-of-work contender, but for those seeking exponential returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as the more aggressive play. Ethereum: Breaking Out With Bullish Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,531.95, up sharply from $1,800 at the start of May and now at a two-month high. Technical indicators remain bullish, with a target range of $2,750‚Äì$2,900 for May and projections as high as $5,925 by year-end. Institutional adoption, Layer 2 advancements, and DeFi growth are all strengthening ETH‚Äôs long-term outlook. As Ethereum‚Äôs rally matures, smart capital is rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture the next wave of exponential returns. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY ‚Äì ACT NOW Conclusion Smart capital is converging around MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum as the top altcoin picks for the 2025 bull run. With Stage 8 nearly complete, robust demand, and a clear listing roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year. The window for entry is closing‚Äîand those watching closely know this could be the cycle‚Äôs defining moment.

Gox. Strive said in a May 20 regulatory filing that it partnered with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to target claims to Bitcoin ( BTC ) that have received definitive legal rulings but are still awaiting distribution. The company said buying the claims would allow it to purchase Bitcoin at a discount and grow its Bitcoin per share ratio ahead of its planned reverse merger with Asset Entities ‚Äî which is expected to be completed sometime mid this year. Strive hasn‚Äôt disclosed any Bitcoin holdings but claims it will face fewer restrictions on purchasing Bitcoin than companies going public through Special Purpose Acquisition Company mergers. Advantages of going public via a reverse merger compared with a SPAC merger. Source: Strive Strive said it would need shareholder approval to pursue Mt. Gox claims. The company said it intends to lodge a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to outline the full terms of the proposed transaction. A proxy statement would then be sent to shareholders to seek their approval. Strive would need to obtain shareholder approval relatively soon, as Mt. Gox is expected to fully repay its creditors by Oct. 31. The Japan-based Mt. Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange before it collapsed in 2014 from a security breach that resulted in the theft of approximately 750,000 Bitcoin . Strive‚Äôs pivot to become a Bitcoin treasury company reflects a broader industry trend as more firms look to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets as a long-term strategic asset.

Gox plans Asset Entities (ASST), a social media marketing company that Strive announced it would merge with on May 7 to create a Bitcoin investment company, has seen its shares close May 20 trading up 18.2% to $7.74, Google Finance data shows. The latest share price bump brings its market cap to $122.1 million, and ASST is now up 1,170% since Strive announced its merger plan. Strive is expected to own 94.2% of the combined entity once the reverse merger is complete, while Asset Entities will hold the remaining 5.8%. The merged companies will be named Strive and Asset Entities, and will still trade under the ASST ticker.

With XRP gaining momentum from increasing institutional adoption and clearer regulatory standing, analysts are forecasting a potential 10x to 20x upside as global payment use cases expand. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance, still under the radar but rapidly climbing, offers early entry into what many believe is the next big crypto before the 2025 bull run peaks. Investors who participate in Phase 4 of the Mutuum Finance presale can look forward to reaping 140% returns when the token goes public, with a guaranteed launch price of $0.06. To date, the presale has generated more than $8.9 million and has attracted over 11,000 holders, with Phase 4 being more than 95% sold. Together, these two tokens represent a unique blend of established credibility and untapped growth potential, making them standout choices for those asking what crypto to buy now before the next wave of gains hits. Over $8.9 Million Raised by over 11,000 Adopters The presale of Mutuum Finance continues to rise to greater heights. Now in Phase 4, the token costs $0.025 and will appreciate in value. As the presale progresses to Phase 5, the token price will appreciate to $0.03, earning current investors an immediate 20% gain. With an expected launch cost of $0.06, the profit potential keeps mounting. Crypto experts have already branded MUTM as among the most undervalued DeFi tokens of the year. Supported by over $8.9 million in backing and over 11,000 users, Mutuum Finance is poised to take off. To help create a more social atmosphere, Mutuum Finance has added a leaderboard showing the top 50 token holders in real time. Users with a lot of tokens are rewarded with bonus coins, which brings competition to the platform and motivates users to keep their tokens for a long period. It also promotes better interaction among the main supporters of the project. Stable, Secure, and Built to Last Mutuum Finance is developing a completely collateralized, USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Its overcollateralized design prioritizes price stability, sidestepping risks associated with algorithmic stablecoins. The application is built on open-source, third-party audited smart contracts, establishing a firm foundation of security and trust, institutional adoption drivers. Smart Tokenomics with a Long-Term Vision One of the most wonderful aspects of working with Mutuum Finance is its Buy-and-Distribute feature, and it does so by purchasing tokens from the public market and redistributing the same among stakers. It benefits the general user interaction and sustains the tokenomics of the project through supply management and rewarding the long-term investors on a consistent basis. Gamified Ecosystem and Community Rewards To further involve its user community, Mutuum Finance gamifies the process with a top 50 token holder leaderboard, who also earn additional MUTM tokens. There is also an ongoing $100,000 giveaway, where ten lucky winners will be awarded $10,000 in tokens each. The company also has a referral scheme for rewarding users for increasing the community organically and through grassroots channels. Don‚Äôt miss your chance to be part of the next big breakout in crypto. With over $8.9 million raised and more than 11,000 early adopters, Mutuum Finance is rapidly approaching a sell-out in Phase 4 of its presale, now over 95% complete. The current price of $0.025 is set to jump to $0.03 in the next phase, offering an instant 20% gain for new buyers. Secure your position now before prices rise again and the presale closes for good, because by the time the crowd catches on, it‚Äôll already be too late.

While XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin continue to dominate the top tier, one new contender is rapidly capturing trader attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE.With Stage 8 now live and inflows surging, traders from across the ecosystem‚Äîincluding XRP and Solana holders‚Äîare pivoting toward what‚Äôs now ranked as one of the most explosive breakout candidates of Q2 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market Driver Holding Above $105K Bitcoin is holding strong at $105,941, up 2.8% in the last 24 hours and approaching new all-time highs. Institutional inflows are at record levels, with $6.9 billion entering U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs over the past three weeks. Major corporate buyers like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have added thousands of BTC to their treasuries, signaling growing confidence in Bitcoin as a macro asset. As BTC consolidates above $105K, capital is flowing into breakout altcoins‚ÄîMAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the top of that list for traders seeking the next 10,000% run. CLICK HERE ‚Äì 2025‚ÄôS BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE MAGACOIN FINANCE: The #1 Breakout Entry of the Moment MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching fire across presale trackers and trader dashboards. With Stage 8 nearly full, over $8 million raised, and a listing target of $0.007, analysts are projecting up to 50x returns as listings approach. Its scarcity-driven model‚Äîa capped 100 billion token supply, 45% in presale, and HashEx-audited contracts‚Äîsets it apart from typical meme coins.As capital rotates from majors, MAGA‚Äôs structure, community-first strategy, and strong early-stage momentum are making it the most-watched presale of 2025. For those seeking exponential upside, this is the entry window to watch. XRP: Futures Launch and Institutional Surge XRP is trading at $2.36 as of May 20, 2025, with the CME Group‚Äôs launch of XRP futures marking a major milestone for institutional adoption. While short-term volatility is possible, analysts see $5‚Äì$10 as the next major target, and some project $20+ if ETF approval and global settlement use cases accelerate.As institutional flows grow, many XRP holders are also rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture sharper upside during this cycle. Solana: Whale Accumulation and Technical Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading at $166.71, consolidating after a sharp rally and drawing attention from large investors. Whale accumulation is on the rise, with three new wallets withdrawing over 145,000 SOL from exchanges in recent days.Analysts are targeting $200 as the next major resistance, with bullish technicals supporting further upside. As Solana‚Äôs rally matures, traders are diversifying into presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater potential returns. Ethereum: Quiet Build-Up and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,489, rebounding from recent lows and showing renewed technical strength. With Layer 2 upgrades, DeFi growth, and ETF speculation, ETH is poised for a potential breakout toward $2,750‚Äì$2,900 in the coming months.As Ethereum‚Äôs rally consolidates, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting investors seeking the next explosive move. TRON: Steady Growth Amid Market Rotation TRON (TRX) is holding at $0.124, maintaining steady growth as network activity remains robust.

Since tagging a local high on May 10th, DOGE has dropped over 18%, retracing some of the gains from its impressive rally that began in early April. Bulls had built strong momentum following the breakout above $0.13, which marked a 100% price surge within a month. However, recent price action suggests the move may be stalling. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal ‚Äì Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? The market now watches closely to see if Dogecoin can defend current levels or if further downside is on the horizon. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the latest rejection has opened the door for a possible revisit to the $0.213 level ‚Äî a key zone that previously served as both resistance and support. This level may now act as a magnet for price if bullish control continues to fade. While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the next move will depend on whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if DOGE breaks below its local range. The coming days could define the trajectory of Dogecoin‚Äôs midterm trend, with volatility likely to pick up. Speculation Rises But DOGE Faces Crucial Test During the recent correction that sent shockwaves across the crypto market, meme coins like Dogecoin were among the most heavily affected assets. As Bitcoin and major altcoins faced steep retracements, DOGE experienced an aggressive pullback, shedding over 18% since May 10th and erasing a significant portion of its earlier gains. This correction disrupted the bullish structure that had formed after DOGE surged over 100% from early April, following a breakout above the $0.13 mark. Despite the drop, speculation continues to mount around Dogecoin‚Äôs potential to lead if the market regains momentum. Historically, DOGE has acted as a high-beta asset, often outperforming in euphoric phases of the cycle. With the broader market attempting to stabilize, some analysts view DOGE as a likely beneficiary if sentiment shifts bullish once again. Still, risks remain. Price is now hovering just above key support levels, and a failure to hold this zone could trigger a deeper retracement. Martinez shared a technical view suggesting that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin may want to revisit the $0.213 level ‚Äî a critical area that previously acted as a launchpad during the April breakout. The coming sessions are likely to be decisive. The meme coin narrative could regain strength if bulls reclaim control and push DOGE back toward the $0.26 resistance. However, if bearish momentum builds and DOGE breaks lower, it would signal a continuation of the current downtrend. For now, all eyes remain on this pivotal support zone as Dogecoin navigates a high-stakes moment within the broader market‚Äôs uncertain conditions. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level ‚Äì $10 Support Back In Focus Technical Details: Dogecoin Facing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of weakness after failing to hold above key resistance near $0.26 earlier this month. The daily chart indicates that DOGE is currently trading at $0.221, consolidating just above the 200-day EMA ($0.219) and below the 200-day SMA ($0.269). This range has acted as a battleground between bulls and bears, with the recent candles forming tight-bodied structures, signaling indecision. Volume has declined notably since the early May breakout, suggesting a loss of momentum and trader interest. If DOGE loses the $0.219‚Äì$0.220 support zone, the next logical support level sits near $0.213, aligning with analyst concerns of a potential retest of that level. A breakdown below this area could trigger further downside pressure toward the $0.19 zone. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal ‚Äì Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound On the upside, reclaiming the 200-day SMA at $0.269 would be a significant bullish signal, as it would place DOGE back above long-term resistance. However, the current trend favors a cautious stance, especially amid broader market uncertainty and weakened sentiment across altcoins. Overall, the chart reflects a pause in bullish momentum and rising risk of a deeper retrace unless DOGE regains strength above key moving averages. The next few days could determine whether consolidation holds or turns into a full correction.

The alleged motive? Her family‚Äôs cryptocurrency fortune . In a chilling new reality, digital wealth is no longer just vulnerable to hackers‚Äîit‚Äôs putting lives on the line in the physical world. Crypto owners are being kidnapped , tortured, and extorted across the globe. From France and India to Latin America and Nigeria, these incidents are rising with alarming frequency as criminals adapt their tactics to pursue a new high-value target: anyone visibly successful in the digital asset space. Crypto is providing criminals with a new type of target Crypto‚Äôs allure has always been its promise of autonomy, borderless wealth, and anonymity. However, that autonomy is becoming a liability for individuals who have struck it big. Unlike a bank account that requires bureaucratic steps to access, crypto wallets can be emptied in minutes‚Äîunder duress. Michael Lyons , an anti-money laundering attorney at Clifford Chance, concurs. He holds, ‚ÄúCrypto transactions are more likely to escape the level of scrutiny applied to traditional banking systems.‚Äù In India, a Bengaluru businessman was lured to Lucknow under the pretext of a business deal, only to be kidnapped and held for a ransom of 10 million rupees. In Latin America, kidnapping crews with cartel ties have begun demanding ransom not in cash but in Bitcoin, often using privacy-enhanced coins like Monero to mask their tracks. One Venezuelan crypto trader, who asked not to be named, described being tailed for weeks before armed men intercepted him outside a mall. ‚ÄúThey knew what I drove, where I lived, even which exchange I used,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey held my family until I transferred the funds.‚Äù Kidnappers have gone digital The rules of engagement have shifted. Where old-school ransom schemes might involve anonymous wire transfers or suitcases of cash, today‚Äôs criminal outfits are leveraging the technologies that gave rise to crypto: decentralization, pseudonymity, and global reach. According to a report by BankInfoSecurity , criminals are increasingly demanding ransom in Monero and other privacy coins because they are harder to trace than Bitcoin. ‚ÄúThe privacy coins make the laundering process easier for them, so they obviously prefer it, but they will still accept BTC,‚Äù said a cybercrime analyst quoted in the article. In some instances, criminals are no longer waiting for the wealthy to become careless. They‚Äôre using facial recognition, blockchain transaction tracking tools, and even SIM swapping attacks to isolate targets. The lines between cybercrime and street-level violence have blurred. The Interpol has also reported increased coordination between cybercrime units and traditional law enforcement as crypto crimes cross national borders. These cases have created a new breed of hybrid criminals employing a mix of digital sophistication and brutal coercion to their nefarious ends. The crypto industry is taking notice Security, once an afterthought in the fast-moving world of crypto, has become a front-and-center concern. Executives and influencers are hiring private security firms, sometimes staffed with former intelligence operatives. High-net-worth individuals are relocating, installing panic buttons, and switching to encrypted communications. Amid a spate of kidnappings and the Coinbase hack, increasingly large crypto holders are hiring private security firms. Some investors have opted for a lower profile. They now conduct meetings virtually, scrub their social media of luxury photos, and use pseudonyms even within crypto communities. This stance is a far cry from the early days of crypto culture‚Äîwhere flexing wealth was part of the brand. Today, discretion is survival. Meanwhile, exchanges and wallet providers are reevaluating their user education practices. Physical security awareness campaigns now supplement tutorials on setting up hardware wallets and using multi-signature authentication. All these initiatives show that while a user‚Äôs seed phrase is important, so is their situational awareness. Combating crypto crime requires understanding that air-gapping your wallet is unhelpful if you broadcast your wealth through social media and other means. Law enforcement is playing catch-up While the threats are global, the responses have been fragmented. Law enforcement agencies often lack the technical know-how to investigate crimes involving digital assets. Jurisdictional challenges complicate matters: when a ransom is paid in France and funneled through wallets in Panama, who has authority? Some progress is being made. INTERPOL has launched a Financial Crime and Anti-Corruption Centre to address transnational financial threats, including crypto-related ones. However, international coordination remains a major hurdle. In the U.S., the Department of Justice has stepped up crypto training for its cybercrime units and partnered with blockchain analytics firms to trace illicit transactions. However, experts say the lag between policy formulation and technological evolution is widening. There is also debate about whether crypto platforms should shoulder more responsibility. Some argue exchanges need to implement AI-driven behavior detection systems that could flag suspicious patterns before funds are forcibly withdrawn. Yet privacy advocates caution against sweeping surveillance in the name of safety. They argue that we can‚Äôt sacrifice decentralization and privacy entirely to police bad actors. So, we must find ways of achieving that difficult balance. Crypto must address its cultural problem Beyond policy and policing lies a deeper cultural issue: the glamorization of sudden wealth. Crypto communities on YouTube, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter) are rife with images of Lamborghini, luxury watches, and high-rise living. This culture of conspicuous consumption has painted targets on the backs of newcomers and veterans alike. Some of the most at-risk individuals are early adopters who experienced 1000x returns overnight. Many are young, inexperienced with wealth, and unaware of the attention they‚Äôre attracting. To these investors, the rising number of crypto kidnappings shouldn‚Äôt just be another crime wave. Rather, it‚Äôs a wake-up call. They must understand that their success stories must come with robust identity protection, not flaunting their assets and always assuming someone‚Äôs watching them. What‚Äôs the way forward? As the crypto industry matures, so too must the systems around it. That means that investors need to take personal security as seriously as they take portfolio diversification. Platforms and exchanges should include user education on physical safety, not just cyber hygiene. Furthermore, l aw enforcement agencies need cross-border frameworks and technical expertise to respond effectively. But beyond systems and policy, a cultural shift is needed. We must move away from the glamorization of sudden wealth and toward a culture of security-minded, privacy-conscious engagement with digital finance. Cryptocurrency has opened the door to financial freedom for millions. But freedom, in this case, comes with a price‚Äîand for too many, that price is proving far too high. It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way.
