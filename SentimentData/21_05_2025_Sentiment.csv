Over the past several weeks, major Ethereum holders known as whales have significantly increased their positions, indicating strong conviction in the asset‚Äôs future. These whales, each holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH, have been aggressively accumulating since mid-April, just as Ethereum‚Äôs price began a steep climb. This pattern, alongside key technical signals, is raising expectations of a longer-term bullish phase. Whale Accumulation Aligns with Price Breakouts According to analyst Crypto Rover, large Ethereum wallets added over 1.4 million ETH between mid-April and mid-May. Their holdings grew from 15.8 million to more than 17.2 million ETH. This accumulation period closely matches Ethereum‚Äôs price rally from around $1,600 to over $3,100.

But a pair of chart watchers say the pullback could be brief. According to analysis from Jake Wujastyk, the meme token is poised for a sharp climb once key levels hold. Based on reports from fellow analyst Bitcoinsensus, there‚Äôs even more upside sketched out on detailed patterns. Related Reading: Bitcoin‚Äôs $10K Rhythm: Steady Climb Signals Strong Push To $115K Chart Pattern Signals Potential Breakout Jake Wujastyk spotted a descending triangle that began forming after Dogecoin hit $0.26 on May 11. Prices swung between the upper resistance line and a lower support line, tightening the wedge. Earlier, DOGE surged 8% in a single session, pushing near the top trend line. Daily Trend Break Opportunity on $DOGE üî•#Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakoutüíπ The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation. Next‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/tykuWOfAbs ‚Äî Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) May 19, 2025 Now the coin has dipped back into the wedge, but it‚Äôs still trading between those two lines. If the pattern breaks upward, Wujastyk argues that it could set the stage for a rapid move higher. Volume hasn‚Äôt spiked yet, so the setup isn‚Äôt sealed. But the shape of the chart suggests potential for a breakout. #Dogecoin There‚Äôs no way I couldn‚Äôt take this trade with a chart that looks like this. Target is a double here around 45 cents. pic.twitter.com/HxbrFVseiv ‚Äî Jake Wujastyk (@Jake__Wujastyk) May 18, 2025 Analyst Forecasts Rapid Price Rise Based on reports, Wujastyk expects a ‚Äútwofold rally‚Äù from current levels. That means pushing from around $0.21 today to roughly $0.45. That‚Äôs about 114% higher. He‚Äôs confident there‚Äôs ‚Äúno way you won‚Äôt take a Dogecoin trade‚Äù if the chart action holds. His call comes as the token struggles this week, down 7% in one day and flirting with erasing the prior week‚Äôs gains. Wujastyk‚Äôs bullish view hinges on a bounce off the wedge‚Äôs support, followed by a strong push through resistance. If it happens, traders could see quick gains, he says. Mixed Targets Highlight Uncertainty Another voice, analyst Bitcoinsensus, sees a similar move to above $0.40 but on a slightly different pattern. He points to an inverse head‚Äëand‚Äëshoulders that formed between March and early May. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight The left shoulder came from a March 11 low at $0.14, the head from an April 7 dip to $0.13, and the right shoulder near $0.16 on May 6. After the pattern broke out, DOGE hit a trendline that‚Äôs capped gains since December‚Äôs $0.48 high. Even with a pullback from that supply zone, Bitcoinsensus says a further push could launch Dogecoin back toward $0.42‚Äì$0.43 within seven days. Those targets suggest a 100‚Äì104% jump from today‚Äôs price.

The Commission‚Äôs clarified guidance on compliance mechanisms has sparked renewed confidence among blockchain projects. This regulatory clarity comes on the heels of Asian economic hubs ramping up blockchain adoption to streamline digital identity, finance, and cross-border payments. Within this recalibrated environment, digital finance is shedding its speculative shell and moving toward practical utility. Qubetics , a fast-rising force, is redefining how digital assets interact with real-world economies. As markets reevaluate what defines a ‚Äútop crypto to buy,‚Äù tokens like Qubetics are not merely participating‚Äîthey are steering the transformation. With its distinctive application in real-world asset tokenization, Qubetics has emerged as a consistent favorite when ranking the top crypto to buy. Qubetics ($TICS) has already gained early traction for directly addressing challenges many established protocols have overlooked. These developments make Qubetics one of the top crypto to buy before the crypto presale concludes. Qubetics: Transforming Real-World Asset Tokenization at the Right Time While the market fixates on transaction speeds and DeFi interoperability, Qubetics is pioneering a more impactful frontier‚ÄîReal World Asset (RWA) Tokenization. This application enables tokenizing tangible assets like real estate, commodities, or financial instruments onto blockchain ledgers. Qubetics stands apart with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, a platform built for global businesses, professionals, and even governments seeking compliant asset digitization. Unlike generalized marketplaces, Qubetics creates a bridge between physical and digital economies. The marketplace is designed to: Enable cross-border trade settlements using tokenized invoices Allow professionals to tokenize service contracts and intellectual property Support small enterprises with compliant debt issuance through digital tokens Facilitate real estate-backed stable asset creation By streamlining tokenization through built-in regulatory protocols and an intuitive IDE (Integrated Development Environment), Qubetics makes complex processes accessible to non-technical entities. This leap positions it as the top crypto to buy for those seeking tokenomics rooted in practical value. Qubetics Token Stats Stage: 35th of the ongoing crypto presale Price: $0.2785 per $TICS Total Tokens Sold: 513M+ Holders: 26,700+ Capital Raised: $17.1M+ Analyst ROI Projections $TICS at $1 post-presale = 258% ROI $TICS at $5 = 1694% ROI $TICS at $15 after mainnet launch = 5284% ROI Without relying on speculation, the growth narrative around Qubetics is underpinned by its ongoing adoption, strong economic model, and increasing relevance in global tokenization policy discussions. Aptos to Host Global Pizza Party Meetup in Palo Alto on May 23 to Celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day Aptos, the high-performance Layer 1 blockchain known for its security and scalability, will co-host a meetup with OnePiece Labs in Palo Alto on May 23, 2025, to celebrate the fifth annual Global Pizza Party by PizzaDAO and mark the anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day. This event brings together Web3 developers, enthusiasts, and entrepreneurs, highlighting Aptos‚Äô commitment to fostering blockchain innovation and community. Powered by its Move programming language and modular transaction processing model, Aptos continues to push the limits of throughput, transparency, and user safety on the decentralized frontier. Tron Coin Breakout? Whale Activity Explodes After Golden Cross Tron (TRX) has rallied 11% since the golden cross on, where the SMA50 overtook the SMA100, signaling a bullish shift after January‚Äôs bearish death cross. Whale activity surged early May as $1M+ TRX transactions peaked between 07:00‚Äì15:00 UTC‚Äîprime global market hours‚Äîbefore easing off, hinting at a growing influence from retail traders. Despite reduced whale dominance, TRX continues climbing, hovering around $0.27 with strong support at $0.23. However, momentum indicators suggest overbought conditions, raising the potential for a short-term pullback if price dips below the $0.24‚Äì$0.25 range. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: Why It Matters in 2025 The transition from speculative cryptocurrencies to tangible digital assets is accelerating. The Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace is central to this shift. Here‚Äôs why: Asset Liquidity: Real estate, fine art, or debt instruments become instantly tradable Regulatory Alignment: Platforms like Qubetics implement compliance-first token design Economic Access: Enables small and mid-size businesses to raise capital without traditional banking Ownership Proof: Digitally notarized contracts increase legal enforceability Programmability: Smart contracts automate dividend payouts and usage rights With $17.1M raised and over 513M $TICS sold, Qubetics is actively proving that tokenized ownership has moved from theory to implementation. This positions it not just as another blockchain startup, but as a foundational layer for the next stage in global finance. Conclusion: Why These Three Are the Top Crypto to Buy in 2025 From Qubetics‚Äô powerful asset tokenization infrastructure to Aptos blockchain ecosystem and Tron‚Äôs mass-market adoption success, these three projects address different layers of blockchain‚Äôs evolution. Their updates, strategic rollouts, and growing traction across sectors reinforce their place as the top crypto to buy in 2025. As blockchain technology enters a new utility-driven era, projects like Qubetics, Aptos, and Tron offer unique propositions tailored to emerging real-world needs.

Per the Russian media outlet RBC , the claim came from Olga Tisen, head of the legal department of the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring (Rosfinmonitoring). Warning for Russians: Crypto Exchanges Are Working With Police Tisen was speaking at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum, currently underway at the city‚Äôs ExpoForum Convention and Exhibition Center. Tisen said that the ‚Äúanonymity of crypto transfers is a myth.‚Äù She claimed that even though Russia has yet to regulate crypto exchanges and brokers, platform operators ‚Äúdisclose all data on the owners of crypto wallets at the request of law enforcement agencies.‚Äù The ExpoForum Convention and Exhibition Centre, St. Petersburg. (Source: Ekatekat [CC BY-SA 4.0]) In many other countries, regulation requires crypto exchanges to flag suspicious-looking transactions and report these to anti-money laundering agencies. However, in Russia, crypto exchanges have no legal status and are almost completely unregulated. But Tisen suggested that exchanges are pre-empting future efforts to police the sector. As such, she said, they are ‚Äúopenly admitting‚Äù to sending customer information ‚Äúat the request of law enforcement and government agencies.‚Äù Tisen added that police do not even need court orders to obtain crypto exchange customer data, ‚Äúsince cryptocurrency transactions are not subject to banking privacy protocols.‚Äù The Rosfinmonitoring executive added that ‚Äúall crypto platforms with offices in Russia‚Äù currently ‚Äúinteract with the authorities.‚Äù Tisen added that many platforms openly state on their websites that they interact with Russian law enforcement agencies. She added that this practice ‚Äúcomplies with international standards.‚Äù In addition, Rosfinmonitoring says that it receives data from banks on crypto transactions.

At present, the coin trades between a support level at $0.41 and a resistance level at $1.01, with a broader range from $0.11 to $1.32 also in view. Indicators such as an RSI near 50 suggest neutrality, while mixed oscillator signals indicate caution. Bulls are present, but recent dips warrant trading ideas focused on short-term consolidation within these key levels. Toncoin: Past Trends and Current Opportunities Over the past month, Toncoin experienced a modest gain of nearly 3%, while the past six months showed a significant decline of around 42%. The price movements illustrate a pattern of volatility, with short-term gains failing to compensate for larger losses. This behavior reflects broader market uncertainties and the reactions of investors to external factors, leading to fluctuating sentiment. TON currently trades between $2.55 and $3.99, facing immediate resistance near $4.82 and a support level around $1.94. Recent activity indicates bears are in control, highlighted by a weekly drop of 8.79% and negative momentum indicators. Without a clear long-term trend, traders may consider opportunities between these key levels while remaining cautious of potential downward movements. Raydium Price Snapshot: Mixed Trends and Key Levels in Focus Raydium experienced a 44.13% gain over the past month alongside a 43.62% drop over the last six months. Price activity has been volatile, reflecting rapid rallies and deeper corrections. The past month has shown strong upward movement while the half-year performance highlights significant pullbacks. Trading sentiment has shifted quickly, revealing a market characterized by both aggressive buying and selling phases. Raydium currently trades between $1.73 and $3.50, with resistance at $4.21 and support at $0.68. Price action indicates balanced pressure with hints of bullish strength recently, though the trend remains unclear. Traders might consider entering near support and watching for rejection at resistance to guide short-term decisions. Conclusion EOS , TON , and RAY are showing strong signs of growth. Each offers unique features and benefits. EOS stands out with its quick transaction speeds. TON provides impressive security and privacy. RAY excels with its staking rewards. These coins are gaining serious traction in the market. Staying informed on their progress may be beneficial. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

April tariffs triggered global market losses and sharp price increases in US consumer goods. Core inflation eased slightly, but financial analysts and lawmakers warn of long-term economic risks. President Donald Trump claimed the U.S. economy is ‚Äúroaring,‚Äù citing March‚Äôs addition of 228,000 jobs.

In a world rapidly reshaped by artificial intelligence, few think as personally about its impact as Manit Parikh. As the Founder of The Binary Holdings , Manit is at the forefront of building digital infrastructure that blends the best of Web2 and Web3 while embedding AI deeply into product design and user experience. Rather than generic chatbots, TBH's vision is for AI companions to learn each user's tastes, routines, and even moods. This ambition echoes a broader tech trend: one analyst predicts that by 2025, our smartphones will function as full-fledged AI assistants, able to perform complex tasks on our behalf and operate like personal assistants in our pockets.Parikh says TBH will deliver that future in emerging markets by blending AI with the company's vast Web3 distribution network. We sat down with Manit to explore his journey, the genesis of Binary Holdings, and how his team uses AI to create hyperpersonalized, behavior-driven platforms that could redefine digital interaction. Q: Can you share a quick background about yourself and what you've been up to lately? Manit: Thank you so much for having me. I'm an economist and lawyer by education‚Äîturned investment banker, consultant, and entrepreneur. I started Binary Holdings in August 2020. COVID had just hit, my daughter had just been born, and like many people, I was forced into a digital-first life. That's when I decided to channel all the product-building skills I'd picked up over the years and turn my vision into something tangible. Q: Tell us more about Binary Holdings. What was the starting point, and how has it evolved? Manit: Binary Holdings started with a product called Fando‚Äîour OG. It was like TikTok meets Twitter, but designed for sports fans with a loyalty program and marketplace built in. We weren't just building a platform; we were building an economy where users could earn value by engaging. As we grew, Fando became just one part of a larger vision. Today, Binary Holdings is an infrastructure company at the intersection of Web2 and Web3, primarily mobile networks and financial services. We're building verticals that can scale across ecosystems. Q: You've been actively building in AI. Where do you see AI's role in our everyday lives right now? Manit: AI is already embedded in how we live. Think about how we used to use Google‚Äîsifting through thousands of results. Now, a single AI response can give you what you need. Whether you're a student, entrepreneur, or creative, we all use AI, from brainstorming to automating personal tasks. Today, maybe AI handles 20% of our digital workload. In five years, it'll be closer to 60‚Äì70%. Q: Let's talk about your AI companion. You mentioned it's central to your roadmap. Can you elaborate? Manit: Absolutely. We've created a voice-based AI companion that doesn't feel robotic; it's conversational and context-aware. Unlike static voice AIs, we aim to make it feel like a real assistant. It's voice-based, context-aware, and emotionally intelligent. It adapts based on your tone, mood, and preferences. It can play multiple roles‚Äîa therapist, a tutor, a friend, a co-pilot. Take mental health. In the West, you go to therapy. In much of Asia, it's taboo. But what if you could talk to an AI that listens, understands your emotional state, and helps you process your thoughts? We're not trying to replace professionals; instead, we're augmenting the support system. Q: As a builder in the Web3 and AI space, how do you stay ahead of the curve? Manit: I'm not an engineer, but I understand financial and business models. That allows me to integrate AI strategically. We collect massive amounts of behavioral data, not personal data, due to GDPR, but enough to understand patterns. We then use AI to create upstream and downstream' mind maps' of user personas. For example, if you're a fan of LeBron James, we map all related content and products into your digital journey. It's like building an AI around your interests, behavior, and ecosystem. Q: That sounds like serious personalization. Why is hyperpersonalization such a big deal? Manit: Discoverability is the biggest pain point in digital platforms. We can remove that friction by using AI to dynamically change what you see based on your behavior. So instead of you searching, the right product or content finds you. Your screen becomes your mirror. Every time you come back, it's slightly more tuned to you. That's what increases engagement and retention. He chuckles, I genuinely believe we're heading to a point where AI could even know when you're hungry based on patterns, location data, and daily habits. That's where hyperpersonalization is going. Q: What tangible results have you seen from hyperpersonalization so far? Manit: It's incredible that the average time spent on our platforms increased from two or three minutes to almost 10 to 12 minutes daily because of personalization. That's nine additional minutes of engagement. Because people consume more content, they burn through mobile data faster. This means they recharge their plans more frequently, three to four times a month instead of once or twice. This directly translates to increased average revenue per user (ARPU) for our telco and data partners. So now, the partnership makes business sense; it's no longer just a cool tech demo; more so, it's real ROI. Q: What does this mean for users in emerging markets? Manit: Most of our users come from underdeveloped or emerging economies‚Äîmiddle and lower-income groups that make up about 90% of the population. For them, the value they earn through our platforms can feel like a secondary income stream. We take things like going out for dinner or a movie for granted, but for some families, this is a real financial boost. It empowers the already empowered, but more importantly, it uplifts those who live hand-to-mouth. That's meaningful. Q: What are the most untapped opportunities for enterprises with AI right now? Manit: There are three big ones. First, they have their internal data. Many enterprises collect data but don't structure it in sandboxes to study behavior. That's a missed opportunity. Second, AI can help forecast the next five years of their business. It can generate strategic product ideas or analyze competitors, giving product managers a head start and saving the company from investing time and capital in dead ends. Third is true hyper-personalization. Let's take gaming. You buy FIFA, and a million people play the same game. But your PlayStation knows how you play. Why doesn't it adapt the gameplay accordingly? If I'm getting better, the AI should level up, too. This not only enhances user experience but also boosts retention and in-game monetization. Q: AI is powerful but also complex. Given the bureaucratic hurdles enterprises face, how do you see them adopting it? Manit: Great question. Enterprises have their plates full with budget cycles, approvals, and public company disclosures. AI becomes another challenge to stack on top. So when we approach them, we don't ask them to change their entire system. We start a parallel thread about a small integration that proves our value. Then, slowly, they come to us asking what else we can help with. Over 12 to 36 months, our tools become embedded into 95% of their operations, including AI, ML, and automation, all without disrupting their existing ecosystem. Q: With so much happening in AI, what excites you most about the future of AI-native products? Manit: I always say, the AI market isn't a pond‚Äîit's the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans combined. What we're seeing now is just scratching the surface. One use case is driving. Say you're on a night drive and tired. The AI companion activates. You choose your mood: 'educational,' ‚Äòbusiness,' or just 'talk.' Maybe you decide to learn a new language during your commute. Since the AI retains your context and adapts, it's far better than static apps. It's a therapist, a study buddy, and a voice coach‚Äîall in one. But with that growth will come consolidation. We're in a collaborative economy now, not a monopolistic one. If we don't collaborate, we'll all get pulled back. And as AI becomes mainstream, it'll attract regulation, just like crypto did. Regulation will separate the real players from the opportunistic ones. Those who build compliant, ethical AI will scale. The rest? They'll fade. As the digital world leans ever more into AI, Manit Parikh and Binary Holdings are not just following trends but shaping them. With personalization as their north star and infrastructure as their foundation, their vision offers a glimpse into what the next generation of platforms could look like, including intuitive, adaptive, and deeply human.

LINK price has recorded a high correlation with Bitcoin price YTD, which is almost entering a parabolic bullish phase. The gradual Bitcoin (BTC) price rise in the past few weeks, has significantly influenced the wider altcoin market led by Chainlink (LINK). The highly anticipated crypto summer of 2025 has seen the overall capital inflow to the altcoin market experience a sharp uptick. Moreover, an imminent reversal and fall of Bitcoin dominance in the coming months will trigger a sustained altseason, fueled by FOMO traders. Chainlink Network Growth Outlook The Chainlink network has received significant adoption in the past few months amid the mainstream adoption of digital assets and web3 protocols. Furthermore, the Chainlink network enables DeFi protocols to provide reliable services in an interoperable ecosystem. Earlier this week, the Chainlink network announced a strategic integration with the Solana (SOL) network to enable its DeFi ecosystem to access Chainlink‚Äôs CCIP infrastructure.¬†On Tuesday, several DeFi protocols announced a strategic integration with the Chainlink network to access its CCIP infrastructure. Some of the notable integrations include Zeus Network, Liquity Protocol, and Shift RWA. The continued adoption of the Chainlink products by institutional investors has bolstered the LINK token, which is used to reward node operators and data providers. Midterm Targets for LINK Price The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $15.7 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $604 million, has been attempting to recover from last week‚Äôs 10 per decline. In the daily timeframe, LINK price has established a rising trend since April 9, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. Moreover, the LINK price has already broken out and retested a falling wedge pattern established in the first quarter of 2025. In the four-hour timeframe, LINK price has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, coupled with a rising divergence of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) . As a result, LINK price is well positioned to rally towards the next short term target around $19.8.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|LINK|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 23:52:27

But while these large-caps fight for renewed upside, one emerging name is gaining traction among serious traders: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Without needing flashy announcements or trend cycles, it‚Äôs steadily cementing itself as one of the most talked-about contenders in the 2025 lineup ‚Äî and buyers are beginning to realize that this project is built to lead, not chase. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Bold Positioning, Relentless Confidence, and Real Market Presence MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising for one clear reason ‚Äî it refuses to play small. In a sea of short-term meme projects and recycled narratives, this coin is commanding attention through consistent strength, focused branding, and clear long-term potential. Analysts are watching closely as sentiment consolidates around what many now view as a high-conviction opportunity for early entry . It is not just hype ‚Äî it is becoming a headline project with all the traits of a breakout altcoin designed for this cycle, not the last one. Cardano (ADA): Whale Activity and Airdrops Keep Bulls in Control Cardano is showing solid structure on higher timeframes, fueled by whale buying and new layer integrations. With ADA hovering just below key resistance, analysts are forecasting a breakout toward $1.32 ‚Äî assuming the recent momentum continues. Speculation around the upcoming Midnight airdrop is also fueling accumulation. If ADA clears the $0.80 barrier, upside movement could accelerate heading into June. Sui (SUI): Technical Breakout in Play With Strong Ecosystem Support SUI remains a trader favorite in the Layer-1 space, offering clean structure and growing DeFi traction. The token is consolidating near recent highs and is flashing early breakout signals, with analyst targets ranging from $6 to $7.70 . Sui‚Äôs ability to sustain user activity while attracting new DEX protocols makes it one of the more structurally solid plays heading into the second half of Q2. Polkadot (DOT): Undervalued Performer With Cross-Chain Advantage DOT is quietly climbing back into view, with multi-chain interoperability and renewed builder interest supporting its rise. Currently trending under key resistance, price targets for this quarter range from $1.05 to $1.30 . If market sentiment shifts in favor of legacy Layer-1s, DOT could reprice quickly ‚Äî especially with increased attention on cross-chain infrastructure and parachain expansion. Final Thoughts Cardano is climbing on whales and incentives. Sui is technically primed and DeFi-proven. Polkadot is setting up as the quiet Layer-1 rotation pick. But while all three fight to reclaim past highs, MAGACOIN FINANCE is defining its own lane ‚Äî and rapidly becoming one of the most confident altcoin bets of the year . In a market overflowing with short-lived speculation, this project is shaping up to be the coin built for staying power ‚Äî and more investors are beginning to treat it that way.

While established players like Monero (XMR) keep their privacy edge and meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) catch attention with quick price surges, newer projects are focused on creating lasting value. Web3 ai stands apart by offering a clear, structured roadmap for growth, aligning product development with investor opportunities. With upcoming releases for AI tools, mobile integration, and exchange listings, Web3 ai offers something unique. For those on the lookout for high-return crypto investments, this project presents an exciting, timely opportunity. What Could Push Web3 ai to the $1 Mark? Web3 ai is quickly becoming a top contender for the best crypto investment in 2025, and its momentum is impossible to ignore. With more than $4.3 million raised in just a matter of days, it‚Äôs clear that investors are already catching on. Currently in presale stage 5 at $0.000365 per token, the presale price will soon rise to $0.005242, meaning early investors could see returns of up to 1,747% before $WAI even hits public exchanges. What‚Äôs fueling the buzz? It‚Äôs not just the numbers, it‚Äôs the impressive roadmap Web3 ai has laid out. The team is rolling out a suite of powerful tools, including an AI trading assistant, ROI prediction engine, staking dashboards, and cross-platform API integrations. Plus, a mobile app is already in the works and is set for release just months after launch. But that‚Äôs not all, wallet and social media integrations, developer SDK access, and even plans for centralised exchange listings are on the horizon. As each milestone is hit, the demand for $WAI only grows, driving up the token‚Äôs utility and value. With a capped supply and a rapidly climbing presale price, the window of opportunity is shrinking fast. For those who want to maximise returns in 2025, now is the time to act before this presale phase ends. Monero‚Äôs Unmatched Privacy: A 2025 Standout Monero (XMR) continues to lead the charge when it comes to privacy in the crypto space. Thanks to its use of ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions, Monero ensures total anonymity for users, from who‚Äôs sending the funds to who‚Äôs receiving them, and even the transaction amounts. This unwavering commitment to privacy has earned Monero a strong following among those who prioritise financial confidentiality. As concerns around surveillance and financial tracking continue to rise, Monero‚Äôs privacy-first approach is more relevant than ever. It‚Äôs not just about concealing identities; it‚Äôs about making it nearly impossible to trace any transactions. This has kept the interest high among users who want complete control over their financial history. With the growing importance of data protection, Monero‚Äôs privacy isn‚Äôt just an added feature; it‚Äôs a core principle driving its adoption. While other projects dabble with partial privacy, Monero delivers full anonymity by default, giving users exactly what they want: total transactional privacy. What‚Äôs Next After SHIB‚Äôs Gain? Shiba Inu (SHIB) recorded an impressive 14.48% jump this week, marking its best performance since late 2024. This surge came after a period of consolidation where SHIB found solid support at the $0.00001107 level. As buyers regained confidence, momentum picked up, and the token ended the week around $0.00001417. This upward trend indicates a shift in market sentiment and growing interest from investors. However, despite this recent gain, SHIB is still below its previous peak of $0.0000297, leaving plenty of room for potential growth. The next key resistance level to watch is around $0.00001698, which traders are eyeing closely. If SHIB can maintain this momentum, with rising trading volume and continued buyer interest, there‚Äôs a real chance the token could build on this positive trend in the coming weeks. All signs point to a recovery, and SHIB‚Äôs potential for further gains remains strong. Final Thoughts In a crypto landscape where trends come and go, true progress stands out. Monero (XMR) maintains its dominance in privacy, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) shows how market sentiment can fuel huge gains. But Web3 ai is carving its path, offering a solid, utility-driven roadmap with clear milestones. With a range of AI tools, a mobile app launch, and potential exchange listings lined up, Web3 ai is building a strong foundation before any major price jumps.

Notably, this marks the second time Bitcoin has rejected around $107,000 in the past few days. Despite this volatility, Bitcoin managed to close last week‚Äôs candle above a key resistance level that had capped its price action for weeks. This close, recorded just above the red horizontal line at $103,000, has introduced confidence in the continuation of the uptrend, and points to the bulls still in control of Bitcoin‚Äôs price action. Bitcoin Weekly Closes Above Range ‚Äì First Bullish Step Current Bitcoin price action shows that bullish investors and buyers are still controlling the momentum behind the largest cryptocurrency and, in essence, the rest of the crypto market. Notably, Bitcoin initially experienced a brief surge to nearly $107,000 over the weekend before retreating. Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Trend Oscillator Shows When To Expect The Price Top This price movement was followed by a dip to around $102,000, with the back-and-forth most likely being influenced by factors such as Moody‚Äôs downgrade of U.S. debt and investor reactions to potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, in an interesting note, the BTC price managed to close above the $103,000 range during this first move to $107,000, which is very important in terms of technical analysis going forward. This sentiment is echoed by crypto analyst Rekt Capital on social media platform X, who pointed out the next step that might play out for Bitcoin. Post-Breakout Retest Underway, Says Rekt Capital The $104,000 price level had previously acted as a stubborn ceiling throughout much of the recent Bitcoin price consolidation between $102,000 and $104,000 since May 9. However, since breaking above this level, the ensuing price action has seen the Bitcoin price retracing towards this level after another rejection at $107,000. Related Reading: Golden Ratio Multiplier Called Bitcoin Top In 2021 ‚Äì Here‚Äôs What It‚Äôs Saying Now According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, the dip following the $107,000 rejection isn‚Äôt necessarily bearish. Instead, it could be part of a post-breakout retest, a pattern often seen in strong bullish structures. If this retest successfully confirms the former resistance as new support, BTC¬†could set the stage for a breakout into fresh all-time highs. As shown in the 1W Bitcoin price chart above, the red resistance level is very close to Bitcoin‚Äôs January 2025 all-time high around $108,780. Furthermore, the chart shows that the recent breakout above the $90,000‚Äì$103,000 zone appears to mirror a pattern of Bitcoin‚Äôs breakout after a consolidation move, after another bounce from a low. In this case, the bounce occurred at the $75,000 low in early April. If Bitcoin does rebound with enough trading volume around $104,000, this could provide the much-needed momentum for a move above $107,000 and finally above $108,700 again. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,555, up by 2.9% in the past 24 hours.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin appears to be forming a bearish divergence on the daily chart. The bearish reversal signal suggests that bullish momentum is waning even though an asset‚Äôs price is moving higher or sideways. Says Bluntz, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a daily BTC bear div brewing here if it closes red by [today]. It‚Äôs unfortunate that it has appeared before fresh all-time highs, but it‚Äôs the first one since last year. Be careful with longs in my opinion.‚Äù Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,546. Turning to gold, the analyst believes that the precious metal is poised to ignite a rally to a new all-time high after completing an ABC corrective wave. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states a bullish asset will continue its uptrend after an ABC correction. The trader shares a chart suggesting that gold will rally to a new record high of $3,600. ‚ÄúGold gathering steam for the next leg up here.‚Äù Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, gold is worth $3,221. As for the memecoin Floki ( FLOKI ), Bluntz predicts that the altcoin would dip to around $0.00008 before exploding to $0.00018. ‚ÄúLooks like FLOKI is one of the few memes with a clear impulse five-wave rise from the lows on the daily, indicating the low is in.

While BTC dominates the headlines, the real growth potential often lies in low-to-mid-cap projects primed to outperform as capital rotates outward.From established names like XRP and Ethereum to surging contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Aptos, a handful of strategic plays are positioning themselves for outsized gains as institutional inflows rise and market sentiment strengthens. Here are four breakout candidates that could capture serious momentum in Bitcoin‚Äôs shadow. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming the #1 Choice in 2025 SMART MONEY IS LOADING UP ‚Äì ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining recognition as a highly asymmetric early-stage opportunity. Still trading under $0.07, the project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 now live and buy activity surging. MAGA‚Äôs $0.007 listing target and scarcity-driven tokenomics have analysts calling for 34x‚Äì40x returns‚Äîand some models point to even more extreme upside if current momentum continuesWhat sets MAGA apart is not just its viral political narrative, but its transparent tokenomics, Hashex audit, and a presale structure that‚Äôs attracting both retail and whale capital. As Stage 8 nears completion, traders are calling this a rare chance to secure early exposure before MAGACOIN FINANCE hits exchanges . In a market searching for the next SHIBA or DOGE, MAGA‚Äôs combination of community energy, clear roadmap, and realistic price targets puts it at the top of many watchlists. Solana‚Äôs Technical Setup and Whale Accumulation Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $171.54, consolidating within a strong support and resistance range between $158 and $175. Analysts highlight a long-term Cup and Handle pattern forming, with a breakout above $175 potentially opening the door to $183 and beyond. SOL‚Äôs fundamentals remain robust, and smart money continues to accumulate, but as capital rotates, many investors are also looking to early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper growth while SOL trades sideways. Ethereum‚Äôs Bullish Breakout and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,531.95, up sharply from $1,800 at the start of May and now at a two-month high. Technical indicators remain bullish, with ETH above its 50-day EMA and forming a classic bull flag pattern.If ETH can break above $2,700, analysts see a move to $2,750‚Äì$2,900 in May and a year-end target between $4,392 and $5,925. As Ethereum‚Äôs rally matures, some investors are rotating capital into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater upside potential. Aptos: Quiet Accumulation and Upside Potential Aptos (APT) is consolidating after a recent event-driven rally, with analysts forecasting a price range of $5.13 to $8.81 for May 2025. While APT‚Äôs tech-first approach has strong backing, some early investors are rotating out profits in favor of lower-cap exposure.MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefitting from that shift, with many short-term speculators taking gains from APT and placing them into MAGA, where exponential upside still remains. XRP‚Äôs Futures Launch and the $100 Question XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts watching closely as the CME Futures launch and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. Legal clarity in the U.S. and growing payment adoption have analysts forecasting a move beyond $5 in the short term, with $15‚Äì$30 possible if key catalysts align.While a $100 price remains a stretch, the infrastructure being built by Ethereum, Solana, and new contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the real drivers of the next major run. JOIN NOW ‚Äî $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion With Bitcoin setting the tone for a powerful 2025, the spotlight is shifting to altcoins with strategic positioning and high-growth potential. Solana and XRP offer credibility and scale, while MAGACOIN FINANCE provides early entry with outsized return potential. Investors rotating now‚Äîbefore listings finalize and media attention catches up‚Äîmay be best positioned to benefit from the explosive upside that defines every crypto supercycle.

This milestone will unveil the complete lineup of 20 crypto exchanges where BDAG will debut. Originally set for 10 exchanges, the expansion to 20 signals the growing confidence in the project. Buyers now have a chance to lock in BDAG at $0.0020 before listings go live. With over $258 million raised so far, this launch could reshape the Layer-1 market. The first five listings are already public: MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. These platforms give an early glimpse of BlockDAG ‚Äôs broad market reach. The full list remains under wraps until the GO LIVE day, which adds suspense and urgency. More than just a listing event, this date marks the final chance to buy BDAG at a reduced price before its rates jump. For many, June 13 signals more than just a listing update, it‚Äôs a defining moment for 2025‚Äôs best performing crypto. BlockDAG GO LIVE Reveal: Strategic Importance of June 13 For anyone watching the crypto presale closely, June 13 holds serious weight. It marks the end of BlockDAG‚Äôs frozen pricing period at $0.0020. That fixed price offers early supporters a rare entry before listings push the coin into open market volatility. With the listing price set at $0.05, this entry window represents unmatched value. Returns since Batch 1 now sit at 2,520%, and more than 20.9 billion BDAG coins have been sold. As the current Batch 28 trades at $0.0262, the opportunity to still buy at $0.0020 before June 13 creates a notable advantage for those seeking gains on the best performing crypto of the year. This deadline is also pushing activity higher as more buyers aim to lock in their coins before the GO LIVE reveal reshapes BDAG‚Äôs pricing forever. Why This Exchange Launch Sets a New Standard Unlike typical launches, BlockDAG‚Äôs GO LIVE reveal showcases real progress, strategic alignment, and global exchange presence. With 20 confirmed exchanges, BDAG is not just appearing in the market, it‚Äôs entering with strength. Each listing brings access to broader audiences, liquidity, and exposure that many new projects never achieve this early. BlockDAG is also following through on its delivery roadmap. Miners have started receiving their X Series mining equipment orders, underlining the project‚Äôs commitment to real-world results. This kind of follow-through supports BlockDAG‚Äôs appeal as a long-term player in the space. Presale excitement continues to grow, thanks to the Buyer Battles and referral rewards program. These efforts keep the community engaged and encourage more users to participate before the deadline. As June 13 draws closer, BlockDAG looks increasingly like the best performing crypto entering the market this year. In Summary Mark June 13 on the calendar. It will be one of the most important moments of the year for anyone eyeing the best performing crypto before launch. BlockDAG‚Äôs GO LIVE reveal will confirm 20 exchange listings and finalize the $0.0020 entry price period. With over $258 million raised, over 20.9 billion coins sold, and a 2,520% ROI since Batch 1, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a standout in 2025. Once the listings are live, prices will likely react quickly. Until then, the opportunity to get in at a frozen price still stands. This is one presale that deserves full attention before June 13 resets the market dynamics.

Some are introducing new tools, expanding partnerships, or leveraging cross-chain solutions to grow their networks. These moves aren‚Äôt just about marketing hype; each coin here shows signs of actual traction. Those tracking the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025 will find this mix particularly engaging. The list features projects tied to AI, multichain access, and infrastructure development, offering a broad view of where value is forming. With Unstaked‚Äôs rollout plan, Cosmos expanding Ethereum access, and Sui bringing Bitcoin into DeFi, these assets are carving out strong narratives. Some launch major initiatives, while others aim to rebound after market dips. Every pick on this list presents a setup worth noting right now. 1. Unstaked: AI Utilities That Deliver Real Results Unstaked has been gathering momentum for its hands-on AI approach. The platform allows users to run AI agents that manage tasks like handling community posts and automating responses on Telegram and X. These aren‚Äôt inactive features; they‚Äôre judged by what they achieve, and rewards are based on their work. This system, named Proof of Intelligence, promotes active use instead of passive holding. Every interaction is stored transparently on-chain. With 60% of tokens offered publicly and no allocations for private rounds or VC parties, it gives broader access to early participants. Priced at $0.009267 in stage 13 and targeting a launch price of $0.1819, it reflects a possible ROI of 2700%. There‚Äôs also a $1 million prize pool campaign underway. Anyone purchasing at least $100 in $UNSD and completing social steps can enter to win $50,000, 20 winners in total. So far, the presale has raised $6.3 million, with $2 million collected in just two days. While some mention the platform has live agents, it‚Äôs important to clarify that these tools will only activate once the presale wraps up and the platform goes live. With a working model, strong interest, and transparent metrics, Unstaked deserves its place among the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 2. Sui: Bitcoin Utility and Expanding Features Sui has been pushing forward technically by linking Bitcoin-backed tokens into its ecosystem. Through a tie-up with Bitlayer, Peg-BTC (YBTC) can now be used within Sui‚Äôs DeFi framework, allowing BTC holders to earn through the platform. It also teamed up with 21Shares to support real-world asset applications. On top of that, Sui just crossed 8 million new wallet holders this month, which points to rising traction. With its current price near $1.85, down slightly for the day but up nearly 70% in a month, SUI still looks strong. Analysts believe the asset could move toward $6 if this pace holds. The addition of Axelar enables wider dApp development across chains. Thanks to fresh features and cross-chain potential, Sui earns a place on the list of fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 3. Cosmos (ATOM): Enhancing Access and Developer Reach Cosmos has made several updates that support adoption. It was just added to Bitbank, a top exchange in Japan, with zero trading fees during launch. That could draw new trading volume from Asia. But more importantly, Cosmos rolled out IBC v2, which improves how users and developers interact with Ethereum rollups. It makes multi-chain work smoother and cheaper, key for future growth. ATOM is priced around $4.90, with short-term charts hinting a drop toward $4.50 by May 18. However, projections for later this year point to a bounce to $6.80. With improved cross-chain tools and increased exchange access, Cosmos is set to stay on the watchlists of those looking into the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 4. Polkadot (DOT): Development Growth Despite ETF Delay Polkadot has seen mixed sentiment recently after the U.S. SEC delayed its decision on a DOT ETF proposal from 21Shares. This pause caused a slide below $5, and the price currently sits at $4.82, still struggling to break the $5.30 ceiling. Forecasts suggest a short-term dip to $4.45, with potential for a slow rise back to $5.15 later this year. But behind the scenes, development remains active. OpenZeppelin confirmed smart contract compatibility with Polkadot, which opens the door for more dApps on the chain. While prices are soft for now, continued work on developer tools helps Polkadot stay competitive. Its evolving ecosystem keeps it in talks among the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025, especially if ETF updates go positive. Final Thoughts! Momentum is forming across these projects. Sui is growing with Bitcoin integration and asset tokenisation, Cosmos is unlocking better Ethereum rollup access, and Polkadot keeps adding dev tools while waiting on ETF clarity. Yet Unstaked remains a standout, combining performance-based AI tools, a strong $6.3 million presale, and an open supply model without outside allocations. Anyone evaluating the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025 should keep these four in sight. Sui, Cosmos, and Polkadot all offer strong technical moves, while Unstaked adds an upcoming utility layer tied to real activity. With the launch still ahead, Unstaked also brings a rare entry chance before full rollout. These picks represent some of the sharpest plays in today‚Äôs market trends.

Experts warn that this blind spot could have serious consequences for Silicon Valley and the broader digital economy. Allianz Trade, an intelligence firm that tracks global trade risks, published a report on Tuesday based on a survey of 4,500 companies worldwide. It aimed to measure the impact of rising trade tensions and warned that a focus on the United States‚Äô trillion-dollar goods deficit threatens to overlook the fastest-growing part of global trade, the ‚Äúinvisible exports‚Äù of financial and digital services. Though tracking these services is challenging, the report cites estimates showing a US digital trade surplus of at least $600 billion, including digital advertising, video streaming, cloud platforms, and online payment services. Digital surplus by firm (USD bn). Source: Allianz Trade Global Survey 2025 The report calls this ‚Äúhidden trade immense‚Äù. It says these invisible exports have greatly outpaced the growth of goods exports over the past two decades, yet they do not show up in standard trade statistics. Allianz Trade warns that if Washington does not ‚Äúrethink trade policy and narratives‚Äù to begin tracking these services more closely, it could undermine one of America‚Äôs innovative companies and massive data infrastructure, just as the president is negotiating deals with much of the world. The report stresses that overlooking this trade could leave US firms exposed to foreign retaliation. Furthermore, US digital exports now make up about 3.6% of all trade worldwide and continue to grow quickly. These unseen exchanges add to US trade revenues without filling any container ships. In today‚Äôs economy, routers and data centers are as crucial as ports and factories for keeping America in a leading position. Yet, President Trump‚Äôs current plan requires countries hit by his reciprocal tariffs to strike a deal by July 8, a deadline he admits may not allow talks with every partner. US trade partners are already exploring tariffs or taxes on digital services Experts agree that if these measures become permanent, they might damage the US tech industry and even split the internet by forcing companies to tailor their services to different regions. Jovan Kurbalija, a former diplomat and head of the DiploFoundation, warned in an April blog that a shift into the digital domain could carry ‚Äúfar-reaching consequences‚Äù for Silicon Valley and the global digital economy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed to the Financial Times last month that she is planning countermeasures if talks between the European Union and the United States fail. Those could include a tax on digital advertising revenues aimed at firms like Amazon, Google, and Facebook, as well as tariffs on services traded across the entire EU market. Kurbalija said that beyond Europe, Trump‚Äôs goods tariffs give other countries both moral and tactical reasons to fast-track digital taxes under the banner of ‚Äúreclaiming revenue from foreign tech ‚Äòfree riders.‚Äô‚Äù Half of US firms considering more investment in China In an opinion piece , Neal K. Shah, CEO of CareYaya Health Technologies, warned that ‚Äútariffs on digital services would directly reduce revenues for American tech companies.‚Äù He said a full-blown digital trade war could harm the Internet‚Äôs infrastructure and force firms to operate ‚Äúparallel digital universes with incompatible standards.‚Äù Shah said that means higher costs, less market access, and slower growth for startups and innovators. He added that splitting the digital world could end globally scalable platforms, scare away investors, and cut world GDP by up to 5% over the next decade. Trump‚Äôs answer to these threats remains more tariffs. He has said that ‚Äúonly America should be allowed to tax American firms,‚Äù Reuters reported . In February, he issued a memo ordering research into how to respond to digital service taxes, including new duties. Yet Allianz Trade found that many US firms are not returning operations home. Instead, half of those surveyed are weighing increased investments in China, while only eight percent plan cuts there. Others said they are rerouting supply chains to Southeast Asia, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Latin America. Experts like Bertin Martens of the Brussels think tank Bruegel say imposing digital services tariffs is hard in practice. Laws barring measures against platforms with a significant local presence require detailed user data. Some see open-source technology as the clear winner if tariffs force firms to seek alternatives that sidestep trade barriers.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and XRP Could Lead 2025‚Äôs Political Crypto Boom",https://thecoinrise.com/500-to-7-figures-magacoin-finance-bitcoin-and-xrp-could-lead-2025s-political-crypto-boom/,"Introduction With Bitcoin regaining momentum, XRP drawing institutional flows, and Ethereum breaking out above key resistance, investors are zooming in on a select group of tokens set for major upside in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the charge‚Äînot just for its explosive growth potential, but because Stage 8 is now live and analysts are calling it a high-conviction 40x altcoin candidate. Kaspa (KAS) is also catching attention as its ecosystem expands, but the spotlight is squarely on MAGA, BTC, XRP, and ETH as the market pivots toward political and narrative-driven plays. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Coin to Watch Before Stage 9 CLICK HERE ‚Äì ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing serious attention as Stage 8 nears completion, with over $8 million raised and a hard listing target of $0.007. Unlike legacy coins where much of the upside is already priced in, MAGA offers structured scarcity, surging demand, and transparent price discovery. Analysts are projecting a 35x‚Äì40x ROI from current levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if listing momentum continues. With each stage filling rapidly and community growth accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as the final major entry before the price curve steepens and Stage 9 begins. Bitcoin: Macro Momentum and Political Narrative Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, having gained over 14% in the past 30 days and now less than 7% below the $100,000 mark. On-chain data shows demand rebounding, with major wallets accumulating as US-based ETF inflows stabilize. While institutional conviction is still ramping up, analysts see a plausible summer rally toward $150,000 if current trends hold. As the political narrative heats up in the US and abroad, Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a macro hedge and a political statement is drawing new capital‚Äîwhile early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are benefitting from this shift in sentiment. XRP: Derivatives, ETFs, and Global Settlement XRP is trading around $2.39, with forecasts for late 2025 targeting $2.65‚Äì$2.80 if current momentum holds. The launch of CME futures and growing ETF speculation are fueling institutional interest, while whale accumulation continues to rise. Legal clarity and Ripple‚Äôs expanding partnerships are setting the stage for XRP to serve as a global settlement infrastructure asset. As institutional flows grow, many investors are also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater upside. Kaspa: Technical Strength and Ecosystem Growth Kaspa (KAS) is trading at $0.097, showing resilience after its recent hard fork and ecosystem expansion. Analysts predict moderate gains this year, with a possible move to $0.15 if broader market conditions remain favorable. Kaspa‚Äôs unique blockDAG architecture and active developer community are positioning it as a standout proof-of-work contender, but for those seeking exponential returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as the more aggressive play. Ethereum: Breaking Out With Bullish Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,531.95, up sharply from $1,800 at the start of May and now at a two-month high. Technical indicators remain bullish, with a target range of $2,750‚Äì$2,900 for May and projections as high as $5,925 by year-end. Institutional adoption, Layer 2 advancements, and DeFi growth are all strengthening ETH‚Äôs long-term outlook. As Ethereum‚Äôs rally matures, smart capital is rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture the next wave of exponential returns. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY ‚Äì ACT NOW Conclusion Smart capital is converging around MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum as the top altcoin picks for the 2025 bull run. With Stage 8 nearly complete, robust demand, and a clear listing roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year. The window for entry is closing‚Äîand those watching closely know this could be the cycle‚Äôs defining moment.

Gox. Strive said in a May 20 regulatory filing that it partnered with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to target claims to Bitcoin ( BTC ) that have received definitive legal rulings but are still awaiting distribution. The company said buying the claims would allow it to purchase Bitcoin at a discount and grow its Bitcoin per share ratio ahead of its planned reverse merger with Asset Entities ‚Äî which is expected to be completed sometime mid this year. Strive hasn‚Äôt disclosed any Bitcoin holdings but claims it will face fewer restrictions on purchasing Bitcoin than companies going public through Special Purpose Acquisition Company mergers. Advantages of going public via a reverse merger compared with a SPAC merger. Source: Strive Strive said it would need shareholder approval to pursue Mt. Gox claims. The company said it intends to lodge a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to outline the full terms of the proposed transaction. A proxy statement would then be sent to shareholders to seek their approval. Strive would need to obtain shareholder approval relatively soon, as Mt. Gox is expected to fully repay its creditors by Oct. 31. The Japan-based Mt. Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange before it collapsed in 2014 from a security breach that resulted in the theft of approximately 750,000 Bitcoin . Strive‚Äôs pivot to become a Bitcoin treasury company reflects a broader industry trend as more firms look to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets as a long-term strategic asset.

Gox plans Asset Entities (ASST), a social media marketing company that Strive announced it would merge with on May 7 to create a Bitcoin investment company, has seen its shares close May 20 trading up 18.2% to $7.74, Google Finance data shows. The latest share price bump brings its market cap to $122.1 million, and ASST is now up 1,170% since Strive announced its merger plan. Strive is expected to own 94.2% of the combined entity once the reverse merger is complete, while Asset Entities will hold the remaining 5.8%. The merged companies will be named Strive and Asset Entities, and will still trade under the ASST ticker.

But while Dogecoin is popular, a new project called Ruvi AI is making waves in the blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) space by combining these two. Beyond its innovation, Ruvi AI is an investment opportunity you can‚Äôt ignore. What is Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI is a platform that brings together AI‚Äôs problem solving and the blockchain‚Äôs security and transparency. It‚Äôs for industries like healthcare, finance and logistics where there‚Äôs a need for better data analysis and decision making tools. Ruvi AI enhances these processes, optimizes workflows and delivers insights. A big milestone for Ruvi AI is the release of its Beta platform , where businesses and users can test its real world applications. Unlike many projects in the tech world that promise more than they can deliver, Ruvi AI is already showing its capabilities. Also Ruvi AI has announced that it has secured its first exchange listing , so its token will be publicly tradable. This is just the beginning as the team works to get more exchange partnerships to make it accessible to users and investors. Ruvi AI‚Äôs Presale Success Ruvi AI presale has been a huge success, Phase 1 sold out in just 2 weeks. During this phase early investors could buy tokens for only $0.01 , the price went up to $0.015 in Phase 2 . Market predictions say Ruvi AI tokens could hit $1 soon after listing. For investors this means an opportunity to buy tokens at a heavily discounted price before they potentially go exponential. Rewarding Commitment with Bonuses For early investors Ruvi AI offers incentives through its VIP rewards system , where token bonuses increase as you go up the more tokens you hold. This rewards structure is designed to maximize returns for those who show commitment. Here‚Äôs three investment scenarios: VIP Tier 2If you invest $750 at the current price of $0.015 per token, you get 50,000 tokens.

With XRP gaining momentum from increasing institutional adoption and clearer regulatory standing, analysts are forecasting a potential 10x to 20x upside as global payment use cases expand. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance, still under the radar but rapidly climbing, offers early entry into what many believe is the next big crypto before the 2025 bull run peaks. Investors who participate in Phase 4 of the Mutuum Finance presale can look forward to reaping 140% returns when the token goes public, with a guaranteed launch price of $0.06. To date, the presale has generated more than $8.9 million and has attracted over 11,000 holders, with Phase 4 being more than 95% sold. Together, these two tokens represent a unique blend of established credibility and untapped growth potential, making them standout choices for those asking what crypto to buy now before the next wave of gains hits. Over $8.9 Million Raised by over 11,000 Adopters The presale of Mutuum Finance continues to rise to greater heights. Now in Phase 4, the token costs $0.025 and will appreciate in value. As the presale progresses to Phase 5, the token price will appreciate to $0.03, earning current investors an immediate 20% gain. With an expected launch cost of $0.06, the profit potential keeps mounting. Crypto experts have already branded MUTM as among the most undervalued DeFi tokens of the year.

While XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin continue to dominate the top tier, one new contender is rapidly capturing trader attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE.With Stage 8 now live and inflows surging, traders from across the ecosystem‚Äîincluding XRP and Solana holders‚Äîare pivoting toward what‚Äôs now ranked as one of the most explosive breakout candidates of Q2 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market Driver Holding Above $105K Bitcoin is holding strong at $105,941, up 2.8% in the last 24 hours and approaching new all-time highs. Institutional inflows are at record levels, with $6.9 billion entering U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs over the past three weeks. Major corporate buyers like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have added thousands of BTC to their treasuries, signaling growing confidence in Bitcoin as a macro asset.

With Stage 8 nearly full, over $8 million raised, and a listing target of $0.007, analysts are projecting up to 50x returns as listings approach. Its scarcity-driven model‚Äîa capped 100 billion token supply, 45% in presale, and HashEx-audited contracts‚Äîsets it apart from typical meme coins.As capital rotates from majors, MAGA‚Äôs structure, community-first strategy, and strong early-stage momentum are making it the most-watched presale of 2025. For those seeking exponential upside, this is the entry window to watch. XRP: Futures Launch and Institutional Surge XRP is trading at $2.36 as of May 20, 2025, with the CME Group‚Äôs launch of XRP futures marking a major milestone for institutional adoption. While short-term volatility is possible, analysts see $5‚Äì$10 as the next major target, and some project $20+ if ETF approval and global settlement use cases accelerate.As institutional flows grow, many XRP holders are also rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture sharper upside during this cycle. Solana: Whale Accumulation and Technical Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading at $166.71, consolidating after a sharp rally and drawing attention from large investors. Whale accumulation is on the rise, with three new wallets withdrawing over 145,000 SOL from exchanges in recent days.Analysts are targeting $200 as the next major resistance, with bullish technicals supporting further upside. As Solana‚Äôs rally matures, traders are diversifying into presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater potential returns. Ethereum: Quiet Build-Up and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,489, rebounding from recent lows and showing renewed technical strength. With Layer 2 upgrades, DeFi growth, and ETF speculation, ETH is poised for a potential breakout toward $2,750‚Äì$2,900 in the coming months.As Ethereum‚Äôs rally consolidates, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting investors seeking the next explosive move.

Since tagging a local high on May 10th, DOGE has dropped over 18%, retracing some of the gains from its impressive rally that began in early April. Bulls had built strong momentum following the breakout above $0.13, which marked a 100% price surge within a month. However, recent price action suggests the move may be stalling. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal ‚Äì Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? The market now watches closely to see if Dogecoin can defend current levels or if further downside is on the horizon. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the latest rejection has opened the door for a possible revisit to the $0.213 level ‚Äî a key zone that previously served as both resistance and support. This level may now act as a magnet for price if bullish control continues to fade. While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the next move will depend on whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if DOGE breaks below its local range. The coming days could define the trajectory of Dogecoin‚Äôs midterm trend, with volatility likely to pick up. Speculation Rises But DOGE Faces Crucial Test During the recent correction that sent shockwaves across the crypto market, meme coins like Dogecoin were among the most heavily affected assets. As Bitcoin and major altcoins faced steep retracements, DOGE experienced an aggressive pullback, shedding over 18% since May 10th and erasing a significant portion of its earlier gains. This correction disrupted the bullish structure that had formed after DOGE surged over 100% from early April, following a breakout above the $0.13 mark. Despite the drop, speculation continues to mount around Dogecoin‚Äôs potential to lead if the market regains momentum. Historically, DOGE has acted as a high-beta asset, often outperforming in euphoric phases of the cycle. With the broader market attempting to stabilize, some analysts view DOGE as a likely beneficiary if sentiment shifts bullish once again. Still, risks remain. Price is now hovering just above key support levels, and a failure to hold this zone could trigger a deeper retracement. Martinez shared a technical view suggesting that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin may want to revisit the $0.213 level ‚Äî a critical area that previously acted as a launchpad during the April breakout. The coming sessions are likely to be decisive. The meme coin narrative could regain strength if bulls reclaim control and push DOGE back toward the $0.26 resistance. However, if bearish momentum builds and DOGE breaks lower, it would signal a continuation of the current downtrend. For now, all eyes remain on this pivotal support zone as Dogecoin navigates a high-stakes moment within the broader market‚Äôs uncertain conditions. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level ‚Äì $10 Support Back In Focus Technical Details: Dogecoin Facing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of weakness after failing to hold above key resistance near $0.26 earlier this month. The daily chart indicates that DOGE is currently trading at $0.221, consolidating just above the 200-day EMA ($0.219) and below the 200-day SMA ($0.269). This range has acted as a battleground between bulls and bears, with the recent candles forming tight-bodied structures, signaling indecision. Volume has declined notably since the early May breakout, suggesting a loss of momentum and trader interest. If DOGE loses the $0.219‚Äì$0.220 support zone, the next logical support level sits near $0.213, aligning with analyst concerns of a potential retest of that level. A breakdown below this area could trigger further downside pressure toward the $0.19 zone. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal ‚Äì Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound On the upside, reclaiming the 200-day SMA at $0.269 would be a significant bullish signal, as it would place DOGE back above long-term resistance. However, the current trend favors a cautious stance, especially amid broader market uncertainty and weakened sentiment across altcoins. Overall, the chart reflects a pause in bullish momentum and rising risk of a deeper retrace unless DOGE regains strength above key moving averages. The next few days could determine whether consolidation holds or turns into a full correction.

The alleged motive? Her family‚Äôs cryptocurrency fortune . In a chilling new reality, digital wealth is no longer just vulnerable to hackers‚Äîit‚Äôs putting lives on the line in the physical world. Crypto owners are being kidnapped , tortured, and extorted across the globe. From France and India to Latin America and Nigeria, these incidents are rising with alarming frequency as criminals adapt their tactics to pursue a new high-value target: anyone visibly successful in the digital asset space. Crypto is providing criminals with a new type of target Crypto‚Äôs allure has always been its promise of autonomy, borderless wealth, and anonymity. However, that autonomy is becoming a liability for individuals who have struck it big. Unlike a bank account that requires bureaucratic steps to access, crypto wallets can be emptied in minutes‚Äîunder duress. Michael Lyons , an anti-money laundering attorney at Clifford Chance, concurs. He holds, ‚ÄúCrypto transactions are more likely to escape the level of scrutiny applied to traditional banking systems.‚Äù In India, a Bengaluru businessman was lured to Lucknow under the pretext of a business deal, only to be kidnapped and held for a ransom of 10 million rupees. In Latin America, kidnapping crews with cartel ties have begun demanding ransom not in cash but in Bitcoin, often using privacy-enhanced coins like Monero to mask their tracks. One Venezuelan crypto trader, who asked not to be named, described being tailed for weeks before armed men intercepted him outside a mall. ‚ÄúThey knew what I drove, where I lived, even which exchange I used,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey held my family until I transferred the funds.‚Äù Kidnappers have gone digital The rules of engagement have shifted. Where old-school ransom schemes might involve anonymous wire transfers or suitcases of cash, today‚Äôs criminal outfits are leveraging the technologies that gave rise to crypto: decentralization, pseudonymity, and global reach. According to a report by BankInfoSecurity , criminals are increasingly demanding ransom in Monero and other privacy coins because they are harder to trace than Bitcoin. ‚ÄúThe privacy coins make the laundering process easier for them, so they obviously prefer it, but they will still accept BTC,‚Äù said a cybercrime analyst quoted in the article. In some instances, criminals are no longer waiting for the wealthy to become careless. They‚Äôre using facial recognition, blockchain transaction tracking tools, and even SIM swapping attacks to isolate targets. The lines between cybercrime and street-level violence have blurred. The Interpol has also reported increased coordination between cybercrime units and traditional law enforcement as crypto crimes cross national borders. These cases have created a new breed of hybrid criminals employing a mix of digital sophistication and brutal coercion to their nefarious ends. The crypto industry is taking notice Security, once an afterthought in the fast-moving world of crypto, has become a front-and-center concern. Executives and influencers are hiring private security firms, sometimes staffed with former intelligence operatives. High-net-worth individuals are relocating, installing panic buttons, and switching to encrypted communications. Amid a spate of kidnappings and the Coinbase hack, increasingly large crypto holders are hiring private security firms. Some investors have opted for a lower profile. They now conduct meetings virtually, scrub their social media of luxury photos, and use pseudonyms even within crypto communities. This stance is a far cry from the early days of crypto culture‚Äîwhere flexing wealth was part of the brand. Today, discretion is survival. Meanwhile, exchanges and wallet providers are reevaluating their user education practices. Physical security awareness campaigns now supplement tutorials on setting up hardware wallets and using multi-signature authentication. All these initiatives show that while a user‚Äôs seed phrase is important, so is their situational awareness. Combating crypto crime requires understanding that air-gapping your wallet is unhelpful if you broadcast your wealth through social media and other means. Law enforcement is playing catch-up While the threats are global, the responses have been fragmented. Law enforcement agencies often lack the technical know-how to investigate crimes involving digital assets. Jurisdictional challenges complicate matters: when a ransom is paid in France and funneled through wallets in Panama, who has authority? Some progress is being made. INTERPOL has launched a Financial Crime and Anti-Corruption Centre to address transnational financial threats, including crypto-related ones. However, international coordination remains a major hurdle. In the U.S., the Department of Justice has stepped up crypto training for its cybercrime units and partnered with blockchain analytics firms to trace illicit transactions. However, experts say the lag between policy formulation and technological evolution is widening. There is also debate about whether crypto platforms should shoulder more responsibility. Some argue exchanges need to implement AI-driven behavior detection systems that could flag suspicious patterns before funds are forcibly withdrawn. Yet privacy advocates caution against sweeping surveillance in the name of safety. They argue that we can‚Äôt sacrifice decentralization and privacy entirely to police bad actors. So, we must find ways of achieving that difficult balance. Crypto must address its cultural problem Beyond policy and policing lies a deeper cultural issue: the glamorization of sudden wealth. Crypto communities on YouTube, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter) are rife with images of Lamborghini, luxury watches, and high-rise living. This culture of conspicuous consumption has painted targets on the backs of newcomers and veterans alike. Some of the most at-risk individuals are early adopters who experienced 1000x returns overnight. Many are young, inexperienced with wealth, and unaware of the attention they‚Äôre attracting. To these investors, the rising number of crypto kidnappings shouldn‚Äôt just be another crime wave. Rather, it‚Äôs a wake-up call. They must understand that their success stories must come with robust identity protection, not flaunting their assets and always assuming someone‚Äôs watching them. What‚Äôs the way forward? As the crypto industry matures, so too must the systems around it. That means that investors need to take personal security as seriously as they take portfolio diversification. Platforms and exchanges should include user education on physical safety, not just cyber hygiene. Furthermore, l aw enforcement agencies need cross-border frameworks and technical expertise to respond effectively. But beyond systems and policy, a cultural shift is needed. We must move away from the glamorization of sudden wealth and toward a culture of security-minded, privacy-conscious engagement with digital finance. Cryptocurrency has opened the door to financial freedom for millions. But freedom, in this case, comes with a price‚Äîand for too many, that price is proving far too high. It doesn‚Äôt have to be this way.

The SEC said on May 20 that it charged Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin, board member Silvina Moschini, and former investment chief Alex Dominguez with misleading investors about certificates that conveyed rights to receive Unicoin tokens and stock.

The SEC sued Unicoin , CEO Alexander Konanykhin, former board chair Maria Moschini, senior vice president and general counsel Richard Devlin and former chief investment officer and investor relations officer Alejandro Dominguez on securities law violations, Among its allegations , the SEC said Unicoin never actually owned the real estate properties it told investors it had acquired, and that those properties' values were inflated. ""For example, between September 2023 and January 2024, the Promoting Defendants announced acquisitions of properties in Argentina, Thailand, Antigua, and the Bahamas, purportedly with appraised values totaling more than of $1.4 billion; in fact, the majority of those transactions never closed and the actual combined value of the four properties was no more than $300 million,"" the complaint said. The defendants also ""overstated the Company's sales"" of its rights certificates, suggesting in social media posts and to investors that it had raised far more funds than it actually had, the SEC alleged. While Unicoin claimed it had made $3 billion in sales by June 2024, it actually never sold more than $110 million in its rights certificates, according to the complaint. Moreover, Unicoin advertised its rights certificates, including by promising outsized returns of up to 9 million percent, the SEC alleged, pointing to marketing efforts on taxi cabs, ferries, ""office building elevator screens,"" digital billboards, coasters, television programs, news websites and public wi-fi kiosks. ""Additional examples of the Promoting Defendants‚Äô statements include: (a) social media and website posts that touted potential returns of 9,000,000% based on bitcoin‚Äôs 9,000,000% growth in the past 10 years and told investors to 'take advantage of the early days of Unicoin and get them today,' highlighting that 'Bitcoin experienced a tremendous rise in value, transforming early adopters into millionaires, and even billionaires,'"" the filing said.

Crypto legislation proposed in New York New York State lawmakers have already introduced several bills to regulate crypto. In April, Assemblyman Clyde Vanel introduced a bill to amend the state‚Äôs financial law to allow New York State agencies to accept crypto as payment. However, the legislation is yet to reach the state‚Äôs full House or Senate. New York state Senator James Sanders Jr proposed the Blockchain Study Act in February, which would create a crypto task force to investigate the current state of crypto in the State. It has yet to advance past the House.

The case was dismissed with prejudice on April 2, meaning it can‚Äôt be reopened. An increasing number of US states are also working on crypto-related legislation, with at least 18 considering bills to establish a strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

While the market has faced a few pullbacks, the bigger picture still looks hopeful for XRP fans. Key Resistance Holding XRP Back Recently, XRP tried to break through a tough resistance zone between $2.55 and $2.62, but once again, the price got rejected. This area has been a problem for XRP for a while now, just like it has for many other altcoins in the market. After this rejection, the price pulled back slightly, but it‚Äôs still holding above important support levels. The Bigger Trend Stays Bullish Even with these small dips, the overall trend for XRP is still moving up. On the daily chart, XRP continues to form higher highs and higher lows, which is a classic sign of an uptrend. Right now, the price is finding support around $2.30 to $2.34, a zone that was previously a resistance area. As long as XRP stays above this level, the bullish momentum is expected to continue. If the price falls below $2.30, however, the next important support sits between $2.10 and $2.15. Dropping below this zone could lead to a deeper pullback in the short term. Short-Term Price Action: Calm Before the Move XRP is still under the effect of a recent bearish divergence, which caused a small drop followed by sideways price movement. At the moment, it looks like XRP won‚Äôt make any big moves right away. Bitcoin, which often leads the crypto market, is still holding strong ‚Äî and when Bitcoin stays steady, altcoins like XRP usually follow quietly for a while before making their moves. Many market watchers believe that if Bitcoin continues its upward trend, XRP could start recovering in the coming days. Elliott Wave Analysis Suggests One More Rally According to a recent market analysis based on the Elliott Wave theory ‚Äî a popular tool to predict market cycles ‚Äî XRP might still be in the middle of its fifth and final wave to the upside. This wave likely started when XRP hit a bottom in July last year. If this pattern continues, XRP could aim for new highs, with long-term price targets between $4.20, $5.00, or even $5.65 before a bigger market correction begins. Crucial Support and Resistance Levels to Watch (long term) For now, XRP remains in a tight range. Key resistance sits just above $3.30, while strong support lies at $1.21. As long as the price stays above $1.21, the bullish outlook stays in place. A drop below this level, however, would weaken the current setup and might force analysts to rethink their predictions. In the short term, XRP has completed a five-wave pattern, and according to Elliott Wave rules, a three-wave pullback could be next. The expected support for this pullback lies between $2.60 and $1.79. As long as XRP holds above $1.79, the bullish trend remains safe.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 01:46:19

Beijing placed fresh restrictions on seven key rare-earth elements and on the permanent magnets made from them. The minerals are crucial for electric cars, wind turbines, humanoid robots, and advanced fighter jets. Under the rules, Chinese exporters must secure a licence from the Ministry of Commerce before each shipment can leave the country. Exporters and trade bodies now say those licences are being approved at a slow pace. Some shipments to Europe have been cleared, but the pace is far behind demand. ‚ÄúThe window to avoid significant damage to production in Europe is rapidly closing,‚Äù said Wolfgang Niedermark, a member of the executive board of the Federation of German Industries, or BDI. Big US manufacturers are also sounding the alarm. In recent briefings, executives at Tesla, Ford, and Lockheed Martin told investors that China‚Äôs new export controls could slow or even halt supply chains. One European executive based in China, who asked not to be named, called the present delays ‚Äúuntenable‚Äù for foreign firms. ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm witnessing on the ground is that there is really incompetence; they underestimated what the impact would be and what you would need to prepare at the working level,‚Äù the executive said. Beijing widened its export controls just after US President Donald Trump announced steep new tariffs on Chinese goods on 2 April. Many analysts saw the rare-earth move as a direct response, highlighting China‚Äôs leverage as the world‚Äôs dominant supplier of minerals. China‚Äôs rare-earth controls may be a strategic response to US tariffs So far, it is not clear whether any shipments bound for the United States have received licences since Washington and Beijing declared a 90-day ceasefire in their tariff war earlier this month. Yantai Zhenghai Magnetic Material, based in Shandong Province, confirmed it had secured export permits and had ‚Äúresumed‚Äù taking orders from certain buyers. Two people familiar with the situation said at least one consignment destined for Volkswagen‚Äôs operations in Germany had also been cleared. Volkswagen stated that its supply of parts containing rare earths remained stable and that its suppliers had received ‚Äúa limited number of these [export] licences.‚Äù Inside the industry, companies fear the ministry will be overwhelmed as licence applications pour in. One executive said European importers ‚Äúare not sure how to prove‚Äù that their shipments will not be re-exported to the United States, a step that would break the permit rules. Slow license approvals would affect Western companies Tesla chief Elon Musk told investors last month that Chinese officials had asked for assurances that the rare-earth magnets used in the company‚Äôs robot arms would not go into military hardware. ‚ÄúThat is an example of a challenge there. I‚Äôm confident we‚Äôll overcome these issues,‚Äù he said. Permanent magnets made from rare earths are found in combat aircraft such as Lockheed‚Äôs F-35. Short-term shortages could disrupt production lines, and experts predict that the new controls will speed up long-term efforts in the West to build alternative supply chains. Evan Scott, chief financial officer at Lockheed, told investors this week that the company had enough rare-earth material for the rest of the year. He added that he expected US authorities to give priority to Lockheed‚Äôs needs ‚Äúgiven the importance of our programmes.‚Äù Cameron Johnson, partner at the Shanghai-based consulting firm Tidalwave Solutions, said he believes some big companies with long histories in China have managed to move rare-earth cargoes even before their licences were formally approved. ‚ÄúThere is still material going out,‚Äù he said. Cory Combs, associate director at Trivium China, a Beijing consultancy, noted that there is ‚Äúcertainly no evidence‚Äù that China has ‚Äúbluntly cut everyone off.‚Äù With the 90-day tariff truce now in place, he expects the commerce ministry to grant more permits, but he warned that uncertainty remains high. ‚ÄúEveryone wants Mofcom to provide clarity,‚Äù Mr Combs said. ‚ÄúBut China‚Äôs strategic leverage relies partly on the ability to pull the export control lever to the extent that the US does not provide a satisfying deal.‚Äù KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|USD|Yuan,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-21 01:48:29

It now requires one more vote and Governor Greg Abbott‚Äôs signature to become law. The bill draws inspiration from successful efforts in other states, notably New Hampshire‚Äôs model for adding new tokens to its Reserve. Under SB 21, Texas would allow altcoins to be included only if they maintain a market capitalization of at least $500 billion for a continuous period of two years. Texas is rapidly headed to form its own Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Legislators voted resoundingly to advance the‚ÄÇbill. This legislation hopes to see Texas become the third state to own and operate a state-funded Bitcoin Reserve in the United States. The third and final reading would come next, and experts said that was likely to pass easily. SB 21 passes second reading with strong bipartisan support Upon its second reading, the bill, also called Senate Bill 21 (SB 21), received overwhelming bi-partisan support. The vote was 105 to 23. This demonstrates clear partisan agreement. SB 21 would allow Texas to join the‚ÄÇhandful of states that already hold Bitcoin by authorizing the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to operate a state-owned Bitcoin Reserve. The fund will strategically invest taxpayer funds in Bitcoin to create a diversified financial portfolio for Texas, including digital and regular assets. To preserve the state‚Äôs investment, the reserve will be limited to digital assets with a market capitalization of over $500 billion held for at least two years, meaning only stable and established cryptocurrencies will qualify. The reserve‚Äôs operation will be funded through appropriations by the Legislature and other state funding sources. The comptroller‚Äôs office, which under the law is also guided by the city‚Äôs finance department and the Office of Management and Budget, will be the trustee of the currency and will purchase, hold, and sell Bitcoin on behalf of the reserve. Texas joins New Hampshire and Arizona in establishing state Bitcoin Reserve Texas is on its way to being the third state to create an official Bitcoin Reserve after New Hampshire and Arizona. This is just one example of an emerging trend in the US as more states turn to Bitcoin to help fortify their finances. Popularity has been rising for the initiative to hold Bitcoin after President Donald Trump suggested it was a good idea for states to hold Bitcoin; parties such as the South Carolina GOP found this a good time to ask followers to give their opinions. Supporters believe holding Bitcoin can enable states to hedge against inflation and economic instability. The cryptocurrency market has already felt the impact of news of the bill. Amid the state-backed interest in Bitcoin Reserves, the asset price has soared to $106,000, targeting an all-time high. Confidence in Bitcoin and state-led digital asset initiatives is steadily increasing. While primarily a Bitcoin Reserve, SB 21 also includes other digital assets‚Äîprovided they maintain a market capitalization of $500 billion or more for at least 24 months. Texas set to approve Bitcoin Reserve as global interest surges The bill now heads to the‚ÄÇdesk of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who is expected to sign it. Abbott has previously expressed support for cryptocurrency projects and is widely expected to sign SB 21 into law. Following Trump‚Äôs signing of the Bitcoin Reserve into law, interest in similar initiatives has surged to unprecedented levels. States like Utah, Oklahoma, and Kentucky are inching forward with their versions of a bill to join the industry as early movers. A Ukrainian lawmaker has unveiled plans to introduce a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill to be the first in the EU. However, the move has garnered Binance‚Äôs support, with the exchange poised to become a strategic partner for Ukraine‚Äôs Bitcoin ambitions. Additionally, Conor McGregor has plans to launch an Irish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the European country. The former UFC fighter has also scheduled a meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele‚ÄÇto support a nationwide Bitcoin accumulation strategy. UFC fighter turned Irish political hopeful Conor McGregor has endorsed building a Bitcoin Reserve in his country to give more ‚Äúpower back to the people.‚Äù ‚ÄúCrypto in it‚Äôs origin was founded to give power back to the people. An Irish Bitcoin strategic reserve will give power to the people‚Äôs money,‚Äù McGregor wrote¬†to X on May 9. He wants the Irish people to have a stake in this exciting venture. This suggestion immediately appealed to President Nayib Bukele, who is using aggressive tactics of purchasing Bitcoin for his country and disregarding any institutions that are hesitant in doing so KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News|Bitcoin reserve|Texas,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-21 01:49:40

He also rejected claims that the White House is easing military help for Kyiv. Rubio spoke in a Senate hearing one day after President Donald Trump spent two hours on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a call that ended without a clear step toward ending the war that began when Moscow invaded its neighbour. Several Democratic lawmakers said the president squandered the chance to raise the heat on the Kremlin. They faulted him for not warning Putin that Washington and its European partners would widen sanctions unless the Russian leader agreed to a cease-fire. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaking at a Senate hearing. Source: PBS NewsHour During testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio was asked about a bill led by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. The proposal would slap wide-ranging new punishments on Moscow, aiming to choke the money it uses to fight the war. The measure calls for a 500 percent tariff on goods coming from countries that continue to buy Russian oil and gas, along with other limits on finance and technology. ‚ÄúIf in fact it is clear that the Russians are not interested in a peace deal and they want to keep fighting a war, it may very well come to that point,‚Äù Rubio said. But he added that Trump thinks ‚Äúright now if we start threatening sanctions, the Russians will stop talking. There‚Äôs value in us being able to talk to them and drive them to get to the table.‚Äù Democratic committee member Senator Jeanne Shaheen said Putin offered no ‚Äúmeaningful negotiation that would end this war in Ukraine.‚Äù She added, ‚ÄúAs President Trump has admitted, Vladimir Putin is taking him for a ride.‚Äù Senator Chris Van Hollen went further, telling Rubio, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve teamed up with President Trump to throw the Ukrainian people under the bus, and have been played like a fiddle by Vladimir Putin.‚Äù Rubio affirmed that the Trump administration has leverage against Russia Rubio insisted that the administration has the ‚Äúsame leverage today that we had under the previous administration.‚Äù He noted that ‚Äúwhen Vladimir Putin woke up this morning, he had the same set of sanctions on him that he‚Äôs always had since the beginning of this conflict,‚Äù and he stressed that American weapons are still moving into Ukraine. ‚ÄúPutin hasn‚Äôt got a single concession, he hasn‚Äôt got a single sanction lifted,‚Äù Rubio said. Even so, the Florida Republican argued the war can end only through a negotiated deal. ‚ÄúWhat the president‚Äôs trying to do is end a war,‚Äù he told the panel, saying the United States must keep channels open so both sides will sit down. His remarks did little to calm allies who had hoped for tougher language in Monday‚Äôs Trump-Putin talk . The call produced no pledge from Moscow to halt its attacks. Instead, Putin suggested that both parties draft a ‚Äúmemorandum‚Äù that would outline future treaty terms, a move critics dismissed as a stalling tactic that allowed Russian troops to keep fighting while talks dragged on. European and Ukrainian leaders also voiced unease after Trump floated the idea of stepping back as mediator and proposing that the Vatican take over the role instead. They warned that every day without a truce brings more civilian deaths and damage across Ukraine.

But BlockDAG (BDAG) is changing that, making mining available to anyone through practical tools and mobile-friendly options. Whether you‚Äôre a full-time miner or just someone with a smartphone, BlockDAG opens the door to earning. With $258 million raised during its presale, 20.9 billion coins sold, and a 2,520% ROI since batch 1, the numbers are speaking for themselves. There‚Äôs a reason people call it the crypto with 20,000x potential. From BDAG‚Äôs Powerful X-Series Miners to X1 App, Mining Is Now for Everyone Mining isn‚Äôt just for those with high-end setups anymore. BlockDAG has created a toolkit that works for both pros and newcomers. The X10, X30, and X100 miners, over 17,600 units of which have already been sold, offer top-tier power and performance for serious miners. But the biggest shift is the X1 mobile app. With only a smartphone, anyone can start mining. There are no upfront fees, no complicated setup. That simplicity opens doors to a much broader user base, giving more people access to the crypto with 20,000x ROI potential. It‚Äôs smooth, easy, and perfect for beginners. What makes this important is BlockDAG‚Äôs focus on real-world usage. The X1 app isn‚Äôt just a gimmick, it helps grow the network and rewards users for activity, referrals, and time spent engaging. Even if traditional miners doubt mobile mining, BlockDAG‚Äôs hybrid PoW and DAG design ensures that every miner, big or small, helps power a strong, scalable system. Whether you‚Äôre using a $1,000 miner or a basic phone, you‚Äôre part of a broader mission to grow a decentralized network. A $258M Presale That‚Äôs Building More Than Hype BlockDAG‚Äôs rise isn‚Äôt driven by empty promises. With more than $258 million raised, 28 batches released, and 20.9 billion coins sold, this project is building real value. While the current batch is priced at $0.0262, a limited-time offer brings it back to just $0.0020 until June 13. That‚Äôs the same as the batch 1 price, offering late buyers a shot at early-stage ROI. This isn‚Äôt just about catching a dip, it‚Äôs about seeing an entire system in motion. The mining hardware is ready. The beta testnet is active. The X1 app is already gaining users. Unlike other projects that offer promises, BlockDAG is giving users an ecosystem to engage with before the mainnet even goes live. When you combine all this, tools, adoption, and accessibility, it‚Äôs easy to understand why people believe it‚Äôs the crypto with 20,000x potential. What also sets BlockDAG apart is its transparency. The team has rolled out multiple video keynotes, giving real updates on features, roadmap progress, and community milestones. That kind of openness gives both retail buyers and institutions confidence that they‚Äôre backing more than just a whitepaper; they‚Äôre backing results. Making Regular Users Active Earning Nodes BlockDAG‚Äôs smart approach to mining isn‚Äôt just technical, it‚Äôs about how people behave. Many crypto platforms struggle to bring in new users, and even more fail to keep them involved. BlockDAG avoids that by making mining fun and interactive with its X1 app. Users become active nodes by simply participating, earning rewards, making referrals, and competing in real time. A good example is the Buyer Battles contest, which hands out 150 million BDAG daily to the top participants. This adds fun and competition to the mix, turning mining into something people want to do daily. Instead of asking people to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù first, BlockDAG lets them earn while they learn. That strategy removes the usual barriers that stop people in low-income areas or those who aren‚Äôt tech-savvy. With mining options that include everything from pro-level machines to a free mobile app, BlockDAG is ready to grow fast and far. For people who care about more than just flipping a coin, BlockDAG offers a full system. It brings together technology, economics, and a community setup built around real use. This is mining made simple. And if BlockDAG keeps building this way, it may not only live up to the crypto with 20,000x potential, it could redefine what crypto utility actually means. Final Chance to Get In BlockDAG isn‚Äôt chasing crypto trends, it‚Äôs setting its own path. With physical miners from the X10 to the X100, and a user-friendly X1 app, it gives every user a way to mine and earn. The crypto presale speaks for itself: $258 million raised, a 2,520% ROI from batch 1, and a rare $0.0020 offer open until June 13. This isn‚Äôt just another presale, it‚Äôs the beginning of a bigger vision. If you‚Äôre searching for a real opportunity with long-term value, BlockDAG isn‚Äôt just a name to watch. It‚Äôs a chance to join something early, something real, and possibly the crypto with 20,000x potential ready to be realized.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, and Solana Are Leading the Shift",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-next-big-move-magacoin-finance-ethereum-and-solana-are-leading-the-shift/,"Introduction As May 2025 unfolds, conviction-driven capital is flowing into a new set of crypto leaders . From institutional buyers to early-stage speculators, the spotlight is on four tokens: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA), and Stellar Lumens (XLM). Each brings a distinct edge‚Äîmacro leadership, DeFi infrastructure, early-stage asymmetric potential, and cross-border utility. But for those seeking the biggest ROI, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now the most aggressively positioned altcoin in the space. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Being Backed for Major Returns CLICK HERE ‚Äì FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the top early-stage play of Q2 2025 , with Stage 8 live, over $8 million raised, and a listing target of $0.007. Its scarcity-driven 100 billion token supply and Hashex audit have analysts forecasting 35x‚Äì50x returns before listings.MAGA‚Äôs blend of viral narrative, transparent tokenomics, and a presale structure attracting both retail and whale capital is fueling unmatched momentum. As Stage 8 accelerates, those entering now are acting on a clear risk-reward model, not just hype. The window for early entry is closing fast, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly ranked as the #1 altcoin presale for 2025. Bitcoin Holds Ground as Institutional Confidence Grows Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $95,000, consolidating after a strong recovery from April lows. Analysts are targeting $104,000‚Äì$109,000 as key resistance, with the next leg of the supercycle potentially pushing BTC to $150,000 or higher.As Bitcoin anchors the market, it‚Äôs enabling capital to cascade into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the opportunity for exponential gains remains open. Ethereum: Technical Breakout and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,356, retreating from its recent high of $2,728 but still up significantly for May. Technical analysis points to a potential retest of $2,600‚Äì$2,700 if ETH holds above $2,250, with long-term targets as high as $4,500 by late 2025.As the cornerstone of Web3 and DeFi, Ethereum‚Äôs rising institutional interest and rapid Layer 2 adoption continue to bolster its outlook. Solana: Ecosystem Growth Drives Major Momentum Solana (SOL) is trading at $162.08, reflecting a modest pullback after recent highs near $183. For May 2025, the expected trading range is $158‚Äì$175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to a retest of $183 resistance. Solana‚Äôs positive trend remains supported by DeFi growth, Web3 participation, and strong investor confidence. Stellar Lumens: Quiet Utility and Cross-Border Reach Stellar Lumens (XLM) is quietly gaining traction as a cross-border payments leader. While not as headline-grabbing as BTC or ETH, XLM‚Äôs consistent utility and adoption make it a favorite for those seeking stable, long-term growth.As capital rotates, some XLM holders are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper, early-stage upside. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON ‚Äì ACT NOW Conclusion The smart money in May 2025 is moving with conviction‚Äîrotating into tokens with strong fundamentals, clear narratives, and explosive upside potential. Bitcoin and Ethereum provide the foundation, Solana and XLM offer scale and utility, but MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the strategic early entry for those seeking life-changing returns.With Stage 8 heating up and listings on the horizon, this could be the defining moment to secure a position before the next wave begins.

Asked why ETH had rallied over 50% in a week, Hayes dismissed technical triggers and pointed instead to sentiment. ‚ÄúThe most hated asset goes up the fastest in the next cycle,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just human nature.‚Äù For Hayes, the Ethereum comeback was long overdue after years of being overshadowed by Solana and other high-beta tokens. ‚ÄúETH was kind of dead. Everyone hated it. The BTC/ETH ratio was falling, Solana was running‚Ä¶ it was time.‚Äù Why Ethereum Could Soar To $10,000 Despite not having added to his position, Hayes said he remained long Ethereum and was unfazed by the current price. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great it‚Äôs going up, but okay‚Äîlet‚Äôs talk at $10,000 or $15,000. Let‚Äôs talk when it‚Äôs meaningful.‚Äù Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal ‚Äì Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? Hayes placed Ethereum‚Äôs rebound in the broader context of what he calls a global monetary ‚Äúphase shift‚Äù‚Äîa transition away from the US Treasury as the world‚Äôs reserve asset, toward a bifurcated system where store-of-value flows increasingly shift toward gold and Bitcoin. In this paradigm, Ethereum benefits not just from speculative risk flows, but also from structural changes in how capital moves under increasing financial repression and capital controls. While he reiterated his belief that gold and Bitcoin are the two neutral reserve assets in a politically fractured world, Hayes sees Ethereum as a powerful high-beta trade in the coming wave of liquidity expansion. ‚ÄúThey print the money,‚Äù he said bluntly. ‚ÄúAnd the consequence will be gold and Bitcoin going through the roof.‚Äù Still, Ethereum‚Äôs path won‚Äôt be linear. Hayes acknowledged ETH‚Äôs underperformance versus Bitcoin so far, but suggested that ETH‚Äôs moment is coming‚Äîparticularly if regulatory clarity improves or if decentralized finance regains traction with sustainable cash flows. He singled out projects like EtherFi and Pendle as examples of token ecosystems that might finally justify valuation through fundamentals. Related Reading: Ethereum Headed For Crucial Encounter At $4,000 ‚Äì Here‚Äôs Why The potential for Ethereum to outperform dramatically remains, Hayes argued, especially as the market continues to digest what he sees as the beginning of the end for the 50-year US Treasury-based global financial system. ‚ÄúIf you want to preserve access to capital and spend it how you want, the only things you can own are gold and Bitcoin,‚Äù he said. But for the investor with appetite for asymmetry, ETH is ‚Äúa hard slog‚Äù now‚Äîyet still in the early stages of what could be a runaway rally. Whether Ethereum reaches the $10,000 mark in 2025 or beyond, Hayes is positioning for that outcome. ‚ÄúMailstream is about 60% Bitcoin, 20% ETH and then you know a lot of other shitcoins and term sheets of token deals and stuff. On my non-crypto stuff, it‚Äôs physical gold and gold miners and T bills. That‚Äôs it,‚Äù Hayes revealed. At press time, ETH traded at $2,477.

What Happened? The SEC claims that Unicoin and its leaders, including CEO and Board Chairman Alex Konanykhin, board member Silvina Moschini, and former Chief Investment Officer Alex Dominguez, tricked investors with big promises about their crypto project. They sold ‚Äúrights certificates‚Äù that were supposed to give people access to Unicoin tokens in the future ‚Äî tokens they claimed would be backed by valuable real estate and investments in private companies. But according to the SEC, these promises were mostly made up. The real estate the company bragged about was worth only a small portion of what was advertised, and the company raised nowhere near the $3 billion it claimed ‚Äî bringing in only about $110 million from over 5,000 investors. Unicoin reportedly went big with their marketing. Ads popped up in airports, taxis across New York City, on TV, and all over social media. The company presented itself as a next-generation crypto investment opportunity, supposedly safe, stable, and profitable. They even told investors their offerings were ‚ÄúSEC-registered,‚Äù when in reality, they weren‚Äôt. The SEC says Konanykhin personally sold millions of these certificates, targeting investors the company had previously tried to avoid so they wouldn‚Äôt lose their legal exemptions. The Charges and What‚Äôs Next The SEC has officially charged Unicoin and its executives with breaking federal securities laws, including fraud and making unregistered sales. The legal action demands they pay back the money they gained unfairly, along with extra fines and bans from holding executive positions in public companies. Even Unicoin‚Äôs general counsel, Richard Devlin, wasn‚Äôt spared. He‚Äôs been accused of spreading misleading information through investor documents. Devlin has agreed to settle his charges without admitting or denying the allegations and will pay a $37,500 penalty.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 02:01:11

The premiere episode featured Justin Sun, Advisor to HTX, who provided an in-depth discussion on several recent platform highlights. These included the launch of the ‚ÄúMars Program Special Edition,‚Äù the early partnership with the Trump family‚Äôs crypto project, and the powerful growth drivers contributing to HTX‚Äôs Q1 performance. According to Justin, this new series underscores HTX‚Äôs commitment to transparency and building trust within its user base. By engaging directly with users, HTX intends to facilitate open communication, strengthen the connection between users and leadership, and enhance the platforms‚Äô credibility. HTX representative Molly also participated in the show, directly addressing user questions in real-time. Q: The launch of HTX‚Äôs special edition Mars Program has sparked significant buzz within the crypto community. What‚Äôs the strategic thinking behind it, and what message does HTX hope to convey to users through this campaign? Justin Sun: A journey to Mars is actually a personal dream of mine. Interestingly,the Chinese names HTX and Mars form a natural alliteration. My lifelong dream has been to venture into space, a goal I‚Äôve been pursuing incrementally. While sending myself or our users to Mars is not currently feasible, it remains a vision I hope to witness in my lifetime. For now, the first step is space travel. Acknowledging its niche appeal, I believe it‚Äôs a pursuit worth sharing with the HTX community. If there‚Äôs ever an opportunity, I aspire to offer our users the chance to experience space as well. Of course, this is a massive undertaking and not something that will happen overnight. My own space journey has already been delayed over four years. So managing expectations is important. That said, our investment in the space sector is long-term. Our collaboration with companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin is a long-term partnership. Safety is paramount, both in space exploration and in cryptocurrency trading. In the context of spaceflight, our benchmark for safety exceeds that of driving a car. Therefore, I want to emphasize three key aspects of this initiative: its inherent difficulty, its long-term nature, and our unwavering commitment to safety. Our focus on space does not imply any deceleration in our core product development. On the contrary, HTX remains aggressive and ahead of the curve in new asset listings. As a Top 10 exchange, HTX possesses both significant momentum and established credibility. Regarding the speed and quality of token listings, our competitiveness matches, if not surpasses, that of any other exchange in the market. The Mars Program symbolizes our vision for the future, reaching for the stars and beyond. Simultaneously, we remain firmly grounded in our commitment to our community. Our ongoing reward campaigns and $HTX token empowerment initiatives continue to operate at full capacity, delivering tangible value to our users. Q: You partnered with the Trump family‚Äôs crypto project, WLFI and you engaged in a discussion with Eric Trump in Dubai. At the same time, HTX was among the first exchanges to list Trump-related tokens, TRUMP and USD1. How do you view the value of this rapid response to trending topics in terms of brand building and user base expansion? And looking ahead, will HTX continue to double down on hot-red tokens? Justin Sun: Absolutely. We were one of the earliest players to recognize the significance of the Trump family‚Äôs involvement in crypto. From the beginning, I believed that Donald Trump‚Äôs influence would bring a huge wave of positive momentum into space, and now we‚Äôre seeing that come to life. The entire industry got a new lease on life after his campaign ramped up. I am honored to serve as an advisor to the Trump family‚Äôs crypto team. I‚Äôm actively involved in providing insights and helping bridge the gap between crypto and traditional politics and, in a broader sense, possibly even between the two major economies. Our objective is to establish a robust, long-term relationship with the Trump family and onboard individuals from traditional industries into Web3. Our partnership with the Trump family is a long-term commitment. We are dedicated to driving growth across the entire cryptocurrency industry, fostering greater adoption and integration of digital assets. Q: HTX was the only Top 10 exchange to record positive trading volume growth in the first quarter of this year. Could you share more insights into HTX‚Äôs current revenue performance and identify the key sectors driving this growth? Justin Sun: I‚Äôm confident that as long as HTX stays on the right course, sustainable growth will follow. Our strong brand influence, coupled with our established reputation as a veteran exchange, fosters deep and enduring trust among our user base.. The platform also benefits from significant organic traffic and demonstrates robust growth momentum, further solidifying our position in the industry. What sets us apart is our unwavering focus on doing what‚Äôs right, especially in security and risk controls. HTX has maintained an unblemished security record for over twenty months, a significant accomplishment considering the frequency of security breaches within the industry. This exemplary standard remains our top priority. We will soon launch a major win-back campaign for dormant users. If you‚Äôve been away from HTX, there‚Äôs never been a better time to come back and rediscover what we offer. The ‚ÄúReal Talk with HTX Executives‚Äù program was conceived based on my conviction that security is the paramount concern for cryptocurrency users. A lack of public engagement from exchange leadership can potentially erode user trust. This on-camera series will enable HTX executives to speak directly to our users, share important updates, and listen to their thoughts and concerns firsthand. This commitment to open communication is fundamental to how HTX continuously builds and reinforces user trust. There‚Äôs nothing quite like the trust that comes from face-to-face interaction. Direct dialogue between executives and users plays a vital role in fostering mutual confidence and reinforcing user trust in the platform‚Äôs products and services. It‚Äôs something I consider paramount. In response to inquiries about the future role of exchanges and HTX‚Äôs potential redefinition of the ‚Äútrading platform,‚Äù HTX representative @HTX_Molly provided her insights. She explained that HTX is evolving beyond the traditional exchange model, aiming to be a builder driving the industry‚Äôs long-term progress rather than a ‚Äúcrypto arcade‚Äù. By cultivating DAO culture and prioritizing community engagement, HTX is forging deeper connections among miners, developers, and users. This collaborative approach aims to facilitate the integration of Web3 from its current niche into mainstream adoption through genuine consensus-building. She stressed that ‚Äúdaily incremental progress is not just a slogan.‚Äù Writing solid code and providing comprehensive user support are the foundations for reshaping what an exchange can be. For HTX, rankings and short-term recognition are secondary; user trust is the platform‚Äôs most valuable asset. As she put it, ‚ÄúWe prefer to move forward slower, ensuring that every brick we lay can withstand the test of a bull market.‚Äù Addressing a user‚Äôs question about ‚ÄúHow does $HTX compare to other exchange tokens?‚Äù, Molly explained, ‚Äú$HTX is like HTX‚Äôs stock, backed by solid fundamentals rather than speculation.

Recent market indicators paired with bullish sentiment have reignited interest in XRP, with several analysts and community participants aligning around an optimistic outlook for 2026. The combination of improving technicals, upward revisions in price forecasts, and a solid support level near $2.37 is adding strength to the broader narrative. According to Binance‚Äôs latest forecast model, XRP is projected to hit $2.495738 in 2026, reinforcing the growing attention toward this established asset. This momentum, coupled with technical alignment on both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, positions XRP favorably in the coming quarters, especially in a market steadily regaining volume. Meanwhile, Qubetics continues to garner attention among early buyers as its QubeQode-powered infrastructure offers meaningful utility beyond speculative narratives. With more than $17.1 million already raised in its ongoing presale and over 513 million $TICS tokens sold, this rising contender is defining what the next generation of blockchain platforms should look like. As XRP builds toward new milestones, Qubetics is making its own mark through structured innovation, measurable ROI potential, and developer-centric functionality tailored for real-world application. XRP Price Prediction 2026: Growing Technical Strength Backs Forecasts The current price of XRP stands at $2.376894 as of May 20, 2025. Market participants appear increasingly confident that XRP will continue to move upward, supported by a strong ‚ÄúVery Bullish‚Äù consensus rating from over 56% of 774 voters on Binance‚Äôs sentiment tracker. The token has demonstrated steady performance, with predictions for May 2026 setting a potential price level at $2.495738. This aligns with a broader pattern suggesting gradual upward movement through 2030, where the token could reach as high as $3.033586. Several factors support this projection. XRP‚Äôs 50-day moving average is currently sloping up, and its 200-day moving average began to tilt positively as of May 15, 2025. This shift confirms a structurally bullish condition across both short-term and long-term indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also reflects a neutral stance, residing between 30 and 70, with no recent divergence, which reinforces a stable continuation of trend rather than imminent reversal. With no major resistance in the short term and supportive fundamentals in place, the mid-range XRP price prediction 2026 appears technically justified. Sentiment and Forecasts: How Users Are Aligning on XRP‚Äôs Trajectory The market consensus on XRP continues to build momentum heading into 2026. According to the platform data, the forecast curve suggests moderate but consistent growth. Users who participated in Binance‚Äôs predictive tool indicated a strong probability that XRP may trade near or above $2.495738 within the next year. Price expectations for subsequent years extend to $2.620525 in 2027, $2.751551 in 2028, and above $3.03 by 2030. These figures indicate growing long-term confidence in XRP‚Äôs capacity to regain ground lost during earlier consolidation phases. On a shorter horizon, XRP is forecasted to gradually rise over the next month, with a target of $2.386444 by June 19, 2025. This reflects a potential gain of approximately 0.4% in 30 days based on current trends. While these increases may appear modest compared to newer, more volatile assets, XRP‚Äôs appeal lies in its structural resilience and consistently improving base metrics. For long-term participants aiming to avoid speculative volatility, XRP offers a more measured profile with clearly defined growth projections. That makes XRP price prediction 2026 particularly relevant for those evaluating projects with trackable historic data and tested network performance. Technical Foundations Remain Stable Heading into the Next Cycle From a technical perspective, XRP continues to maintain structural integrity across major timeframes. The alignment of both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages signals growing market stability. Importantly, there are no recorded bullish or bearish divergences in the RSI readings for the past 14 candles, which indicates the absence of trend reversal warnings. These conditions support the ongoing forecast of steady upward pressure, aligning with XRP price prediction 2026 across multiple sources. Price target models reinforce the technical readings. Whether viewed through daily forecasts or multi-year projections, the token‚Äôs valuation model suggests incremental but meaningful progression. The broader sentiment indicators and predictive analytics all point to XRP potentially solidifying its place among the most structurally sound digital assets over the next 12‚Äì18 months. While the asset may not deliver triple-digit returns in short order, its position as a value-retaining asset continues to strengthen, particularly as broader crypto sentiment recovers. Qubetics Is Reinventing Utility Through the QubeQode IDE and Tokenized ROI Design As XRP builds on its technical base, Qubetics is capturing attention for an entirely different reason: real-world functionality tailored for builders, freelancers, and enterprises. At the center of its offering is the QubeQode IDE, a visual development environment designed to make decentralized application development accessible without technical complexity. Through drag-and-drop components, pre-built user authentication modules, and token management tools, QubeQode transforms the blockchain development process into something practical‚Äîeven for non-engineers. This functionality is especially impactful for freelancers and small businesses looking to deploy secure, blockchain-based apps without incurring the cost of traditional backend development. Form-based configuration allows users to define application logic visually, while the embedded code snippet library speeds up development with tested components. Enterprises seeking to automate workflows, secure user authentication, or tokenize internal systems are now evaluating Qubetics as a functional alternative to expensive Web2 platforms. With its mainnet launch expected in Q2 2025, this initiative is gaining traction as more users discover the depth behind its technology stack. The Qubetics presale has also emerged as one of the most discussed initiatives among those looking for entry into the best crypto presale opportunities of 2025. Each presale stage lasts precisely seven days and ends every Sunday at 12 a.m., followed by a 10% increase in token price. Currently in Stage 35, Qubetics is priced at $0.2785 per $TICS token. Over $17.1 million has already been raised, and more than 513 million tokens have been distributed to a growing base of over 26,700 holders. What makes the Qubetics presale particularly compelling are the ROI projections associated with various post-launch scenarios. If $TICS reaches $1, buyers entering now would lock in a 258.95% return. A $5 valuation after mainnet would equate to 1,694.74% ROI, while a $6 price projects a 2,053.68% return. Should $TICS hit $10 after its utilities roll out, that return jumps to 3,489.47%, and a $15 outcome would deliver an exceptional 5,284.21% ROI. For example, a $5,000 investment in Stage 35 currently buys 17,950 tokens. If $TICS were to reach just $5, the total value of this holding would be $89,750. At $10, that climbs to $179,500, and at $15, the portfolio‚Äôs value would reach $269,250. These numbers underline why community participants are recognizing Qubetics as not only a technology project but a serious ROI proposition under the best crypto presale conditions currently available. Conclusion XRP continues to deliver a case for long-term confidence through well-aligned technical indicators and structured forecasts, with the XRP price prediction 2026 providing a compelling reason for its re-evaluation. Its consistent support near the $2.37 mark, combined with bullish market sentiment and upward-trending moving averages, strengthens its position as a viable hold through the next cycle. Meanwhile, Qubetics is defining a new direction for crypto adoption through developer empowerment and a clearly structured presale model. The QubeQode IDE offers immediate use cases for a range of users, while the $TICS token provides tangible ROI pathways for participants entering now. As the countdown to its Q2 mainnet launch continues, more buyers are choosing to join this best crypto presale ahead of the next round of price increases.

What The Charts Say,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-ready-new-aths-what-the-charts-say/,"An analyst has explained what some charts related to Bitcoin could say regarding whether the current run can lead to a new high or not. Bitcoin Momentum May Be Stalling According To These Signs In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about some technical analysis (TA) signs that could reveal if it‚Äôs time for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says Here are the charts that the analyst has shared: The first graph shows a TA pattern that Bitcoin has potentially been trading inside for the last few months. The pattern in question is a ‚ÄúParallel Channel,‚Äù which emerges whenever an asset‚Äôs price observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. There are different types of Parallel Channels, but in the context of the current topic, the most ordinary version is of interest: the one with the channel parallel to the time-axis. This case naturally corresponds to a completely sideways movement from the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it‚Äôs visible that BTC has recently observed a rise to the upper line of the pattern. During previous retests, the coin ended up finding rejection at this mark. Thus, it‚Äôs possible that it may also face resistance here during the current retest. This isn‚Äôt the only trend that could make a break to the ATH a tricky one. As is visible from the second graph, the RSI has shown divergence from the Bitcoin price recently. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the speed and magnitude of changes that the asset‚Äôs price has witnessed recently. This metric is generally used for judging overpriced and underpriced conditions for the token. BTC‚Äôs RSI formed a peak in the overbought region earlier in the month, but while the price has gone up since then, the indicator has only managed to form a smaller peak. This type of divergence between the asset and the RSI is often considered to be a bearish signal. Lastly, there is also a bearish development in the MACD, displayed in the third chart. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is another TA indicator that‚Äôs used for gauging momentum. It involves two lines: the MACD line calculated by taking the difference between the 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of the price and the signal line determined as the 9-day EMA of the MACD line. Recently, the MACD line for Bitcoin has dipped under the signal line, which is usually considered as a bearish crossover. Related Reading: Bitcoin At $103,000 Relatively Cool Per This Indicator, Quant Says Based on all these patterns, Martinez has noted that momentum is stalling for BTC. It now remains to be seen how the asset would develop in the coming days and if a reversal to the downside would happen.

While BTC commands institutional dominance, many traders believe the real upside lies in smaller-cap assets that benefit from its momentum. That‚Äôs why tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE , XRP , and Cardano (ADA) are dominating current watchlists. With fresh inflows, expanding narratives, and key technical setups, these three may be best positioned to push toward the elusive 1,000x tier before the year ends. Ethereum (ETH) and Cosmos (ATOM) round out the group with steady performance and ecosystem strength‚Äîbut the spotlight is clearly shifting toward early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE ‚Äì $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Bitcoin‚Äôs Surge: The Market Catalyst Bitcoin‚Äôs latest rally is driven by global economic uncertainty, institutional adoption, and regulatory clarity. Moody‚Äôs US credit downgrade and major banks enabling Bitcoin purchases have strengthened its narrative as a macro hedge, attracting both retail and institutional capital. Historically, when Bitcoin rallies, it often triggers a ‚Äútrickle-down‚Äù effect: capital first flows into BTC, then rotates into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Exponential Potential or Hype? MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout among early-stage altcoins. With over $8 million raised and a presale price under $0.001, analysts project potential returns ranging from 35x to as high as 18,500% (185x), with some even suggesting a $1 target by year-end 2025‚Äîthough this would require a meteoric rise. Its scarcity-driven tokenomics (100 billion cap, 45% in presale), audited smart contracts, and viral meme appeal are fueling rapid community growth and investor interest. Conservative analyst targets: 35x‚Äì50x returns Aggressive projections: Up to 185x, with $1 as a ‚Äústretch‚Äù target Key drivers: Early entry, scarcity, community momentum XRP Prepares for Institutional Access XRP continues to trade above $2.30 , supported by speculation around CME Futures and potential ETF developments. With global settlement infrastructure already in place, and regulatory clarity opening the doors to institutions, XRP is being revalued by investors aiming for long-term growth. Price targets as high as $10‚Äì$15 are being floated as adoption expands. Cardano Shows Quiet Strength With Rebuilding Momentum Cardano (ADA) remains one of the most resilient Layer-1s, and recent upticks in smart contract deployment and active wallet usage are catching attention. While its pace is slower than peers, ADA is regaining confidence as a stable growth play‚Äîand some are looking at it as an undervalued opportunity heading into summer. Ethereum Anchors Portfolios With ETF Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is holding near $2,700 , bolstered by anticipation of spot ETF approval and strong Layer-2 expansion. While not as high-risk as other altcoins, ETH continues to provide solid upside potential for portfolios seeking stability in a rapidly evolving market. Cosmos (ATOM) Builds Developer Engagement Cosmos (ATOM) is seeing renewed developer activity and ecosystem interest. With cross-chain infrastructure gaining traction, ATOM may be one of the more underrated projects quietly building momentum behind the scenes. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE ‚Äì ACT NOW Conclusion Bitcoin‚Äôs strength is creating the conditions for the next round of high-return altcoin plays. While XRP , Cardano , and Ethereum offer layered value, it‚Äôs MAGACOIN FINANCE that currently holds the greatest potential for exponential returns . As early entry narrows and capital flows accelerate, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the most explosive opportunity of 2025.

Many market experts believe ETH could be preparing for another price jump, especially with important updates and events lined up. Doctor Profit‚Äôs move is a good example of how traders often book profits from one coin and invest those gains into another, based on current market opportunities. With Ethereum performing well compared to many other cryptocurrencies lately, it makes sense for traders to consider it for fresh entries.

The trio misled investors while selling ‚Äúrights certificates‚Äù linked to an unissued Unicoin token. The complaint , filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Tuesday, May 20, names chief executive and board chairman Alex Konanykhin, former president Silvina Moschini, and former chief investment officer Alex Dominguez. According to the SEC, the defendants inflated asset values and wrongly implied federal approval to boost sales. ‚ÄúWe allege that Unicoin and its executives exploited thousands of investors with fictitious promises that its tokens, when issued, would be backed by real-world assets including an international portfolio of valuable real estate holdings,‚Äù said Mark Cave, associate director in the SEC‚Äôs Division of Enforcement. ‚ÄúBut as we allege, the real estate assets were worth a mere fraction of what the company claimed, and the majority of the company‚Äôs sales of rights certificates were illusory,‚Äù he added. The agency says Unicoin placed ads in airports, thousands of New York City taxis, on television, and on social media, portraying the certificates as a safe ‚Äúnext-generation‚Äù digital investment. More than 5,000 people bought in, believing each certificate would later convert one-for-one into Unicoin tokens. Unicoin CEO sold 37.9 million of his own certificates Investigators highlight three key misstatements. First, executives said the future tokens were ‚Äúasset-backed‚Äù by billions of dollars in property and stakes in pre-IPO firms, even though company assets were only a fraction of that figure. Second, they boasted of selling more than $3 billion in certificates, while actual proceeds never exceeded $110 million. Third, they described the certificates and tokens as ‚ÄúSEC-registered‚Äù or ‚ÄúU.S. registered,‚Äù though no registration had been filed. The complaint also accuses Konanykhin and the company of running unregistered offerings. Regulators say the chief executive sold more than 37.9 million of his own rights certificates, often at a discount. Unicoin, Konanykhin, Moschini, and Dominguez are charged with violating antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC asked the court for ‚Äúpermanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties ‚Äù and orders barring the trio from serving as officers or directors of public companies. The action also seeks civil fines against the company itself. The suit further names general counsel Richard Devlin, alleging he repeated similar false claims in private placement memoranda.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Bitcoin May Lead the Charge First",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-xrp-going-to-10-magacoin-finance-solana-and-bitcoin-may-lead-the-charge-first/,"Introduction With XRP showing strong technical structure and fresh investor interest, the question on every trader‚Äôs mind is whether a move to $10 is truly on the table. While XRP continues to gain strength, a handful of other tokens are already accelerating ahead. Bitcoin (BTC) is holding firm, Solana (SOL) is maintaining bullish pressure‚Äîand MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning into one of the most talked-about early-stage altcoins of 2025. Alongside them, Polkadot (DOT) is starting to reenter investor conversations, rounding out a lineup of assets that could lead this cycle before XRP fully ignites. JOIN NOW ‚Äî $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Emerging as a Front-Runner MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most aggressively positioned altcoins on the market. Now entering the final stretch of Stage 8 , the project has raised over $8 million and is gaining attention for its unique mix of political narrative, capped supply, and high-engagement community. With a verified HashEx audit and a target listing price of $0.007 , analysts are treating it as a legitimate high-upside contender for this year‚Äôs altcoin breakout list. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE from others in the meme and political token space is its structure. Investors from Bitcoin, Solana, and even XRP communities are now reallocating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for one reason: it still offers real asymmetric entry in a market where most plays are already priced in. XRP‚Äôs $10 Ambition: Hype or Reality? XRP is once again at the center of bullish speculation, with analysts and investors debating whether the token can reach the coveted $10 mark. As of May 2025, XRP is trading around $2.33‚Äì$2.60, buoyed by regulatory clarity after Ripple‚Äôs settlement with the SEC and renewed institutional interest. But is $10 a realistic target in the near or medium term‚Äîand what role do MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Bitcoin play in this evolving narrative? Bitcoin Anchors the Market, Fuels Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin (BTC) : Bitcoin remains the benchmark, stabilizing above $100,000 and projected to reach $200,000‚Äì$250,000 by year-end as institutional demand outpaces new supply. Its continued dominance is setting a bullish tone for the entire crypto sector. Solana Maintains Its Position as the Cycle‚Äôs Layer-1 Leader Solana (SOL) is consolidating between $158‚Äì$175, with bullish forecasts targeting $240‚Äì$280 later in 2025 as its ecosystem grows and institutional adoption rises. SOL‚Äôs consistent performance is prompting some investors to rotate profits into emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater upside Polkadot Reenters the Spotlight on Ecosystem Revival Polkadot (DOT) is seeing a slow but steady return to relevance, with ecosystem upgrades and parachain innovations reviving investor interest. While still early in its rebound, DOT could become a solid rotation play as attention spreads beyond the biggest names. CLICK HERE ‚Äì TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion XRP may be heading toward $10, but the path there may be paved by faster-moving tokens first. MAGACOIN FINANCE , Solana , and Bitcoin are leading the charge, attracting early capital and building strong positioning in Q2 2025. With MAGACOIN FINANCE nearing Stage 8 completion, this could be one of the most time-sensitive opportunities in the market today.

Analysts suggest the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could face a short-term pullback before attempting to break through higher resistance levels. Ethereum Showing Signs Of Overheating According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, ETH is beginning to show signs of an overheated rally. The analyst shared the following chart illustrating ETH‚Äôs total trading volume across various crypto exchanges. In this chart, each bubble‚Äôs size reflects the magnitude of trading volume, while the color indicates the rate of volume change, categorized into four groups ‚Äì Cooling, Neutral, Overheating, and Highly Overheating. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates ‚Äì Is This A Healthy Uptrend? Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing price rally, which began in mid-April 2025, has seen a notable surge in trading activity. Within just a month, the asset‚Äôs market condition shifted from Cooling (green bubbles) to Overheating (red bubbles). The current overheated condition may lead to a short-term correction as the market cools and enters another accumulation phase. However, the depth and duration of any potential pullback remain uncertain. The CryptoQuant contributor attributes this spike in volume to profit-taking and significant resting supply at the psychologically important $2,500 resistance level. Data from CoinGecko shows ETH has jumped an impressive 59.7% over the past 30 days, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) during the same period. ShayanMarkets concludes: Consequently, Ethereum is expected to continue its consolidation phase until fresh demand emerges to drive a breakout above this resistance range in the mid-term. In a separate post on X, veteran crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed to Ethereum‚Äôs Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) extreme deviation pricing bands. He emphasized that ETH must hold above $2,200 to maintain bullish momentum. Should this level hold, Martinez believes ETH could target $3,000, or potentially even $4,000, if buying pressure strengthens. Where Is ETH Headed? Analysts Weigh In Ethereum‚Äôs impressive performance of late has attracted attention from several crypto analysts, who are now speculating the digital asset‚Äôs future price trajectory. According to crypto analyst Ted Pillows, ETH‚Äôs 12-hour chart recently confirmed a Golden Cross, a bullish signal that typically precedes major price rallies. Related Reading: Ethereum Holders Stay Committed Despite Unrealized Losses ‚Äì Signs Of An Incoming Rally? ‚Äã‚ÄãIn another analysis, Pillows forecasted that ETH could be eyeing a move to $4,000, noting that the asset has traded within a massive symmetrical triangle since Q3 2020. The $4,000 level lies just below the triangle‚Äôs upper boundary. In contrast, crypto analyst Gianni Pichichero warned of a potential retracement to $2,350, citing the emergence of lower lows on Ethereum‚Äôs daily chart as a bearish signal. At press time, ETH trades at $2,500, up 3.6% in the past 24 hours.

33767162,[object Object],1747800044,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Ethereum Exchange Supply Hits Historic Low Below 4.9% ‚Äî Is Price Breaking $3,000 Soon?",https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-exchange-supply-declines/,"According to on-chain data from analytics platform Santiment, Ethereum‚Äôs supply on exchanges has dropped to an all-time low, plunging below 4.9%. This marks the lowest level recorded in its 10+ year history and highlights a dramatic shift in investor behavior. This is a prime indicator of an incoming upside for Ethereum, especially with sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency becoming increasingly bullish. Ethereum On Exchanges Hits Record Low Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading around $2,530, a significant recovery from its April lows around $1,385. Notably, ETH‚Äôs price action in the past seven days has been marked by intense volatility . After peaking at approximately $2,730, the price faced resistance and dipped below $2,600. Despite this pullback, the overall market sentiment is still optimistic . Amidst the back and forth in Ethereum‚Äôs price action, on-chain data shows a declining trend regarding the ease of ETH tokens that can be traded on crypto exchanges. As it stands, on-chain data from Santiment shows that just 4.893% of all ETH is now held on trading platforms, a milestone never before seen in Ethereum‚Äôs 10+ year history. Interestingly, more than 15.3 million ETH have been withdrawn from exchanges over the last five years alone. This historic low can be partially attributed to the rise in ETH staking in the past five years, especially since the launch of the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade. The side effect of this has been a continued decline in exchange liquidity. However, this decline also limits the amount of ETH available for spot selling, thereby reducing the kind of sell pressure that typically causes sharp price drops during market corrections. On-chain data from CryptoQuant supports this tightening supply narrative , showing that whale wallets holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH have accumulated over 450,000 ETH in the last month alone. These large-scale acquisitions come at a time when exchange balances are shrinking. The chart from CryptoQuant illustrates how whale balances have surged alongside a steady increase in Ethereum‚Äôs price since April 7. Raoul Pal Predicts ETH Price Will Explode The optimistic on-chain data has been echoed by prominent macro investor and crypto analyst Raoul Pal. In a recent interview, Pal talked on Ethereum‚Äôs explosive potential, saying, ‚ÄúI think ETH is going to shock people probably going forward. It‚Äôs going to explode.‚Äù His outlook is based on the entry of an altcoin season . As it stands, all eyes are on the $2,800 resistance. Technical analysis shows that a Golden Cross has recently been confirmed on ETH‚Äôs 12-hour chart. A clean breakout from this technical formation could open the doors to $3,000 and $4,000, particularly if Bitcoin sustains its current momentum on its way to a new all-time high above $108,800.",Ethereum|Altcoin Season|bitcoin|CryptoQuant|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum 2.0 Upgrade|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|golden cross|Raoul Pal|Santiment,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-05-21 04:00:44

Welch said in a May 21 episode of her ‚ÄúTalk Tuah‚Äù podcast that the FBI showed up at her grandmother‚Äôs house looking to speak to her over the Hawk Tuah (HAWK) crypto token, which many crypto commentators have called an exit scam. ‚ÄúAfter the coin launch, the feds came to granny‚Äôs house and knocked on her door, and she called me, having a heart attack, saying: ‚ÄòThe FBI is here after you, what have you done?‚Äô‚Äù Welch said she handed over her phone to the FBI and met with agents who ‚Äúinterrogated me, asking me questions and everything else related to crypto.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey cleared me, I was good to go,‚Äù Welch said. Welch went viral for her response about an oral sex technique in a vox pop interview posted to YouTube in June. The HAWK memecoin, based on her viral catchphrase, launched in early December and almost immediately lost 90% of its value and blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps‚Äô alleged insider wallets and snipers bought up and dumped massive quantities of the token at launch. Haliey Welch speaking on her Talk Tuah podcast about the HAWK memecoin. Source: YouTube Welch said on her podcast that the Securities and Exchange Commission also asked for her phone, and she sent it off ‚Äúfor two or three days‚Äù before she was cleared. Welch‚Äôs lawyer James Sallah told TMZ in March that the SEC ‚Äúclosed the investigation without making any findings against, or seeking any monetary sanctions from, Haliey.‚Äù ‚ÄúI trusted the wrong people‚Äù Welch admitted knowing very little about crypto before the HAWK memecoin and said she ‚Äútrusted the wrong people‚Äù for the launch. She claimed a company, which she said she couldn‚Äôt name for legal reasons, was in full control of her X account, which posted videos of her promoting the memecoin. Welch said she was sent lines to record on video, which were then posted on her X account by someone she trusted but could also not legally name. She added that on the day of HAWK‚Äôs launch, she ‚Äúkind of knew something was up‚Äù and was pulled into a room where a team of people told her to talk on a livestream with YouTuber Stephen Findeisen, better known as Coffeezilla. ‚ÄúCoffeezilla got on there and they're like ‚ÄòMute it, mute it,‚Äô‚Äù Welch said. ‚ÄúNobody warned me about this guy at all, like nobody at all, they didn't tell me he was like a crypto wizard, that's exactly what he is ‚Äî he ate me the fuck up.‚Äù Related: Justin Sun to attend Trump's dinner with memecoin backers Welch said she was only paid a marketing fee and ‚Äúdid not make a dime from the coin itself,‚Äù which she said had been totally spent on legal and public relations fees. A now-deleted post where Welch shared the HAWK token‚Äôs tokenomics before it launched. Source: X Despite being cleared of any legal wrongdoing, Welch took some accountability, admitting that she let many of her fans down who invested in the coin: ‚ÄúIt makes me feel really bad that they trusted me, and I led them to something that I did not have enough knowledge about. I did not have enough knowledge about crypto to be getting involved with it. And I knew that, but I got talked into it, and I trusted the wrong people.‚Äù A group of HAWK buyers sued the alleged creators of the token in December, claiming Alex Schultz, the token‚Äôs backing Tuah the Moon Foundation, the token launchpad overHere Limited, and its founder Clinton So promoted and sold HAWK as an unregistered security.

While some legal experts following the case closely believe it might take a few more months before a final verdict is reached, misleading claims and rumours continue to spread on social media. Recently, a user named Altcoin Bale posted on X, claiming that the case was already closed, banks were quietly buying XRP, and retail investors would soon be priced out. But this statement didn‚Äôt sit well with pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan, who has been actively tracking the lawsuit. Bill quickly responded, saying, ‚ÄúFFS the case is not closed, or did you miss the news last week about an unsuccessful motion for an indicative ruling and an Appeal and Cross-appeal in abeyance but not over.‚Äù Another user replied to Bill, saying that the case had hit a procedural snag because both Ripple and the SEC submitted a dismissal request using the wrong form.

In simple terms, the judge stated that if the court‚Äôs jurisdiction were restored, she would deny the motion as it was filed under the wrong procedural rule. This means Ripple and the SEC will likely have to refile the motion correctly, and possibly plead their case once again.

The suit, brought to federal court on May 13, claims the company violated Illinois‚Äô Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by capturing users‚Äô facial data without proper notice or consent. Consumer Fraud and Data Breach Charges According to the submission , users were asked to upload a government ID and a selfie as part of the sign-up procedure. These images were then sent to third-party facial recognition tools that analyzed facial features like geometry and faceprints. However, the suit claims this was done without the consent of users, which the violates BIPA. ‚ÄúAt no point during the verification process are Coinbase users asked to consent to the collection of their biometric information, notified that their biometric data will be collected by an unrelated third party, nor provided with any information about the process,‚Äù the lawsuit states. The complaint also accuses Coinbase of transmitting this data to several third-party vendors, including Jumio, Onfido, Au10tix, and Solaris, without getting permission from the parties. Further, the document reveals that over 10,000 individuals filed arbitration demands, but Coinbase‚Äôs refusal to pay the required fees led to their cases being dismissed. As a result, the plaintiffs have charged the exchange with three claims of violating state biometric privacy laws and one for consumer fraud under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. They are seeking damages of $5,000 for every reckless or intentional violation, and $1,000 for each negligent one. The group has also lodged an order to stop the alleged data practices and wants Coinbase to cover its court costs. A Privacy Time Bomb This is not Coinbase‚Äôs first involvement in such legal troubles. In May 2023, similar action was taken over the company‚Äôs handling of facial recognition during onboarding. Meanwhile, the exchange is also dealing with the fallout from a recent data breach in which customer support agents were allegedly bribed to leak sensitive customer information. That incident caused at least six separate class-action lawsuits between May 15 and May 16, with Coinbase being accused of negligence, poor cybersecurity measures, and a slow response. Nanak Nihal Khalsa co-founder of Holonym, a privacy-focused identity company, said the problem is bigger than just the platform. ‚ÄúThe Coinbase breach proves what we‚Äôve known all along, KYC without zero knowledge is a privacy time bomb.
