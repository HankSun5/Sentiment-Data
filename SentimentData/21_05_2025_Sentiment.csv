Over the past several weeks, major Ethereum holders known as whales have significantly increased their positions, indicating strong conviction in the asset’s future. These whales, each holding between 10,000 and 100,000 ETH, have been aggressively accumulating since mid-April, just as Ethereum’s price began a steep climb. This pattern, alongside key technical signals, is raising expectations of a longer-term bullish phase. Whale Accumulation Aligns with Price Breakouts According to analyst Crypto Rover, large Ethereum wallets added over 1.4 million ETH between mid-April and mid-May. Their holdings grew from 15.8 million to more than 17.2 million ETH. This accumulation period closely matches Ethereum’s price rally from around $1,600 to over $3,100.

But a pair of chart watchers say the pullback could be brief. According to analysis from Jake Wujastyk, the meme token is poised for a sharp climb once key levels hold. Based on reports from fellow analyst Bitcoinsensus, there’s even more upside sketched out on detailed patterns. Related Reading: Bitcoin’s $10K Rhythm: Steady Climb Signals Strong Push To $115K Chart Pattern Signals Potential Breakout Jake Wujastyk spotted a descending triangle that began forming after Dogecoin hit $0.26 on May 11. Prices swung between the upper resistance line and a lower support line, tightening the wedge. Earlier, DOGE surged 8% in a single session, pushing near the top trend line. Daily Trend Break Opportunity on $DOGE 🔥#Dogecoin has been slightly pulling back in a very healthy manner, preparing for the next major breakout💹 The anticipated breakout is expected to happen within the next 7 days, with a retest of the trendline for confirmation. Next… pic.twitter.com/tykuWOfAbs — Bitcoinsensus (@Bitcoinsensus) May 19, 2025 Now the coin has dipped back into the wedge, but it’s still trading between those two lines. If the pattern breaks upward, Wujastyk argues that it could set the stage for a rapid move higher. Volume hasn’t spiked yet, so the setup isn’t sealed. But the shape of the chart suggests potential for a breakout. #Dogecoin There’s no way I couldn’t take this trade with a chart that looks like this. Target is a double here around 45 cents. pic.twitter.com/HxbrFVseiv — Jake Wujastyk (@Jake__Wujastyk) May 18, 2025 Analyst Forecasts Rapid Price Rise Based on reports, Wujastyk expects a “twofold rally” from current levels. That means pushing from around $0.21 today to roughly $0.45. That’s about 114% higher. He’s confident there’s “no way you won’t take a Dogecoin trade” if the chart action holds. His call comes as the token struggles this week, down 7% in one day and flirting with erasing the prior week’s gains. Wujastyk’s bullish view hinges on a bounce off the wedge’s support, followed by a strong push through resistance. If it happens, traders could see quick gains, he says. Mixed Targets Highlight Uncertainty Another voice, analyst Bitcoinsensus, sees a similar move to above $0.40 but on a slightly different pattern. He points to an inverse head‑and‑shoulders that formed between March and early May. Related Reading: Analyst Drops Dogecoin Bombshell: 174% Surge To $0.65 In Sight The left shoulder came from a March 11 low at $0.14, the head from an April 7 dip to $0.13, and the right shoulder near $0.16 on May 6. After the pattern broke out, DOGE hit a trendline that’s capped gains since December’s $0.48 high. Even with a pullback from that supply zone, Bitcoinsensus says a further push could launch Dogecoin back toward $0.42–$0.43 within seven days. Those targets suggest a 100–104% jump from today’s price.

Ethereum, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE Are Emerging as Cycle-Defining Picks",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-to-500k-ethereum-xrp-and-magacoin-finance-are-emerging-as-cycle-defining-picks/,"Introduction May 2025 is witnessing a sharp rotation of capital as whales and smart money accumulate select tokens. Bitcoin, XRP, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are leading this trend, with on-chain data and analyst commentary confirming high-conviction buying. Litecoin (LTC) and Ethereum (ETH) remain relevant, but the most notable accumulation is now concentrated in projects with clear upside and imminent catalysts. Bitcoin: Whales Quietly Accumulate Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, with whale addresses accumulating over 83,000 BTC between mid-April and mid-May 2025. Institutional confidence is rising as retail investors take profits, and forecasts for May call for an average BTC price of $119,798, with potential highs of $136,239 by month’s end.As Bitcoin’s momentum steadies above $100,000, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are drawing increased attention from growth-focused investors looking to capture the next wave of upside.

The project’s scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% allocated to presale, and Hashex-audited contracts—has made it one of the most dominant presales of 2025.Analysts forecast 25x–35x returns, with some models pointing to even higher upside if current momentum continues. Whale allocations and rapid presale sellouts highlight strong conviction, positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE as a top altcoin breakout for Q2 and Q3 2025. XRP: Whale Accumulation and Bullish Reversal XRP is trading around $2.07, with whales accumulating over 880 million tokens in May alone. This surge in whale activity comes as XRP breaks out from a multi-month falling wedge, with analysts targeting $2.50–$2.80 as the next resistance levels.As institutional adoption grows and futures products launch, MAGACOIN FINANCE’s pre-listing momentum is also capturing the interest of XRP investors seeking early-stage upside. Litecoin: Steady Accumulation and Bullish Outlook Litecoin (LTC) is trading near $76.87, with forecasts for May 2025 ranging from $76.87 to $77.58. While not as volatile as some peers, LTC continues to see steady accumulation by long-term holders.As capital rotates toward high-upside opportunities, many are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE as a complementary play for exponential returns. Ethereum: Macro Strength and Bullish Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,489, having rebounded from recent lows and showing strong technical momentum. With Layer 2 growth, DeFi expansion, and ETF speculation, ETH remains a macro leader for the cycle.As Ethereum’s rally matures, smart capital is also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture the next exponential move.

The Commission’s clarified guidance on compliance mechanisms has sparked renewed confidence among blockchain projects. This regulatory clarity comes on the heels of Asian economic hubs ramping up blockchain adoption to streamline digital identity, finance, and cross-border payments. Within this recalibrated environment, digital finance is shedding its speculative shell and moving toward practical utility. Qubetics , a fast-rising force, is redefining how digital assets interact with real-world economies. As markets reevaluate what defines a “top crypto to buy,” tokens like Qubetics are not merely participating—they are steering the transformation. With its distinctive application in real-world asset tokenization, Qubetics has emerged as a consistent favorite when ranking the top crypto to buy. Qubetics ($TICS) has already gained early traction for directly addressing challenges many established protocols have overlooked. These developments make Qubetics one of the top crypto to buy before the crypto presale concludes. Qubetics: Transforming Real-World Asset Tokenization at the Right Time While the market fixates on transaction speeds and DeFi interoperability, Qubetics is pioneering a more impactful frontier—Real World Asset (RWA) Tokenization. This application enables tokenizing tangible assets like real estate, commodities, or financial instruments onto blockchain ledgers. Qubetics stands apart with its Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace, a platform built for global businesses, professionals, and even governments seeking compliant asset digitization. Unlike generalized marketplaces, Qubetics creates a bridge between physical and digital economies. The marketplace is designed to: Enable cross-border trade settlements using tokenized invoices Allow professionals to tokenize service contracts and intellectual property Support small enterprises with compliant debt issuance through digital tokens Facilitate real estate-backed stable asset creation By streamlining tokenization through built-in regulatory protocols and an intuitive IDE (Integrated Development Environment), Qubetics makes complex processes accessible to non-technical entities. This leap positions it as the top crypto to buy for those seeking tokenomics rooted in practical value. Qubetics Token Stats Stage: 35th of the ongoing crypto presale Price: $0.2785 per $TICS Total Tokens Sold: 513M+ Holders: 26,700+ Capital Raised: $17.1M+ Analyst ROI Projections $TICS at $1 post-presale = 258% ROI $TICS at $5 = 1694% ROI $TICS at $15 after mainnet launch = 5284% ROI Without relying on speculation, the growth narrative around Qubetics is underpinned by its ongoing adoption, strong economic model, and increasing relevance in global tokenization policy discussions. Aptos to Host Global Pizza Party Meetup in Palo Alto on May 23 to Celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day Aptos, the high-performance Layer 1 blockchain known for its security and scalability, will co-host a meetup with OnePiece Labs in Palo Alto on May 23, 2025, to celebrate the fifth annual Global Pizza Party by PizzaDAO and mark the anniversary of Bitcoin Pizza Day. This event brings together Web3 developers, enthusiasts, and entrepreneurs, highlighting Aptos’ commitment to fostering blockchain innovation and community. Powered by its Move programming language and modular transaction processing model, Aptos continues to push the limits of throughput, transparency, and user safety on the decentralized frontier. Tron Coin Breakout? Whale Activity Explodes After Golden Cross Tron (TRX) has rallied 11% since the golden cross on, where the SMA50 overtook the SMA100, signaling a bullish shift after January’s bearish death cross. Whale activity surged early May as $1M+ TRX transactions peaked between 07:00–15:00 UTC—prime global market hours—before easing off, hinting at a growing influence from retail traders. Despite reduced whale dominance, TRX continues climbing, hovering around $0.27 with strong support at $0.23. However, momentum indicators suggest overbought conditions, raising the potential for a short-term pullback if price dips below the $0.24–$0.25 range. Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace: Why It Matters in 2025 The transition from speculative cryptocurrencies to tangible digital assets is accelerating. The Real World Asset Tokenization Marketplace is central to this shift. Here’s why: Asset Liquidity: Real estate, fine art, or debt instruments become instantly tradable Regulatory Alignment: Platforms like Qubetics implement compliance-first token design Economic Access: Enables small and mid-size businesses to raise capital without traditional banking Ownership Proof: Digitally notarized contracts increase legal enforceability Programmability: Smart contracts automate dividend payouts and usage rights With $17.1M raised and over 513M $TICS sold, Qubetics is actively proving that tokenized ownership has moved from theory to implementation. This positions it not just as another blockchain startup, but as a foundational layer for the next stage in global finance. Conclusion: Why These Three Are the Top Crypto to Buy in 2025 From Qubetics’ powerful asset tokenization infrastructure to Aptos blockchain ecosystem and Tron’s mass-market adoption success, these three projects address different layers of blockchain’s evolution. Their updates, strategic rollouts, and growing traction across sectors reinforce their place as the top crypto to buy in 2025. As blockchain technology enters a new utility-driven era, projects like Qubetics, Aptos, and Tron offer unique propositions tailored to emerging real-world needs. Evaluating long-term value in this sector means identifying those capable of solving meaningful problems—and these three consistently rise to that standard. Those scanning the horizon for the top crypto to buy would be wise to monitor the continuing growth and adoption of these platforms.

Per the Russian media outlet RBC , the claim came from Olga Tisen, head of the legal department of the Federal Service for Financial Monitoring (Rosfinmonitoring). Warning for Russians: Crypto Exchanges Are Working With Police Tisen was speaking at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum, currently underway at the city’s ExpoForum Convention and Exhibition Center. Tisen said that the “anonymity of crypto transfers is a myth.” She claimed that even though Russia has yet to regulate crypto exchanges and brokers, platform operators “disclose all data on the owners of crypto wallets at the request of law enforcement agencies.” The ExpoForum Convention and Exhibition Centre, St. Petersburg. (Source: Ekatekat [CC BY-SA 4.0]) In many other countries, regulation requires crypto exchanges to flag suspicious-looking transactions and report these to anti-money laundering agencies. However, in Russia, crypto exchanges have no legal status and are almost completely unregulated. But Tisen suggested that exchanges are pre-empting future efforts to police the sector. As such, she said, they are “openly admitting” to sending customer information “at the request of law enforcement and government agencies.” Tisen added that police do not even need court orders to obtain crypto exchange customer data, “since cryptocurrency transactions are not subject to banking privacy protocols.” The Rosfinmonitoring executive added that “all crypto platforms with offices in Russia” currently “interact with the authorities.” Tisen added that many platforms openly state on their websites that they interact with Russian law enforcement agencies. She added that this practice “complies with international standards.” In addition, Rosfinmonitoring says that it receives data from banks on crypto transactions. The same agency has already asked the banking sector to carefully monitor all crypto-related account activity. The European Union has approved its latest sanctions package against Russia, targeting nearly 200 shadow fleet ships https://t.co/f4mzICAalV — Bloomberg (@business) May 20, 2025 ‘Blockchain Analytics Solution Helping Us Monitor Transactions’ The agency also plans to let commercial banks use its blockchain analytics tool (Transparent Blockchain) to monitor personal bank accounts. Rosfinmonitoring will provide the tool to banks before the end of the year. The agency has already granted several government agencies and overseas anti-money laundering intelligence agencies access to the tool.

Investors are keen to identify which of these digital assets might be on the brink of skyrocketing. This article delves into the specific coins that are poised for substantial growth, offering insights into the potential opportunities ahead. EOS Market Update: Month Surge and Six-Month Gains Amid Week Dip EOS price action over the last month recorded a 22.15% rise, while the six-month change reached 24.77%, indicating a steady upward trend despite notable short-term fluctuations. The recent weekly drop of 11.63% highlights the coin’s characteristic volatility, combining periods of strength with occasional setbacks, as shown in its broader performance history. At present, the coin trades between a support level at $0.41 and a resistance level at $1.01, with a broader range from $0.11 to $1.32 also in view. Indicators such as an RSI near 50 suggest neutrality, while mixed oscillator signals indicate caution. Bulls are present, but recent dips warrant trading ideas focused on short-term consolidation within these key levels. Toncoin: Past Trends and Current Opportunities Over the past month, Toncoin experienced a modest gain of nearly 3%, while the past six months showed a significant decline of around 42%. The price movements illustrate a pattern of volatility, with short-term gains failing to compensate for larger losses. This behavior reflects broader market uncertainties and the reactions of investors to external factors, leading to fluctuating sentiment.

April tariffs triggered global market losses and sharp price increases in US consumer goods. Core inflation eased slightly, but financial analysts and lawmakers warn of long-term economic risks. President Donald Trump claimed the U.S. economy is “roaring,” citing March’s addition of 228,000 jobs. He credited his administration’s economic approach for strengthening the labor market and reviving manufacturing in key industrial states. He emphasized new industrial activity across the Midwest and South, pointing to recent factory openings and domestic hiring. Trump described the data as proof that economic momentum is shifting in America’s favor. Despite the uptick in jobs, official data shows the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 0.6% in the first quarter of 2025. Economists link the decline to trade disruptions and weaker consumer activity, highlighting mixed signals for the economy’s overall health.

In a world rapidly reshaped by artificial intelligence, few think as personally about its impact as Manit Parikh. As the Founder of The Binary Holdings , Manit is at the forefront of building digital infrastructure that blends the best of Web2 and Web3 while embedding AI deeply into product design and user experience. Rather than generic chatbots, TBH's vision is for AI companions to learn each user's tastes, routines, and even moods. This ambition echoes a broader tech trend: one analyst predicts that by 2025, our smartphones will function as full-fledged AI assistants, able to perform complex tasks on our behalf and operate like personal assistants in our pockets.Parikh says TBH will deliver that future in emerging markets by blending AI with the company's vast Web3 distribution network. We sat down with Manit to explore his journey, the genesis of Binary Holdings, and how his team uses AI to create hyperpersonalized, behavior-driven platforms that could redefine digital interaction. Q: Can you share a quick background about yourself and what you've been up to lately? Manit: Thank you so much for having me. I'm an economist and lawyer by education—turned investment banker, consultant, and entrepreneur. I started Binary Holdings in August 2020. COVID had just hit, my daughter had just been born, and like many people, I was forced into a digital-first life. That's when I decided to channel all the product-building skills I'd picked up over the years and turn my vision into something tangible. Q: Tell us more about Binary Holdings. What was the starting point, and how has it evolved? Manit: Binary Holdings started with a product called Fando—our OG. It was like TikTok meets Twitter, but designed for sports fans with a loyalty program and marketplace built in. We weren't just building a platform; we were building an economy where users could earn value by engaging. As we grew, Fando became just one part of a larger vision. Today, Binary Holdings is an infrastructure company at the intersection of Web2 and Web3, primarily mobile networks and financial services. We're building verticals that can scale across ecosystems. Q: You've been actively building in AI. Where do you see AI's role in our everyday lives right now? Manit: AI is already embedded in how we live. Think about how we used to use Google—sifting through thousands of results. Now, a single AI response can give you what you need. Whether you're a student, entrepreneur, or creative, we all use AI, from brainstorming to automating personal tasks. Today, maybe AI handles 20% of our digital workload. In five years, it'll be closer to 60–70%. Q: Let's talk about your AI companion. You mentioned it's central to your roadmap. Can you elaborate? Manit: Absolutely. We've created a voice-based AI companion that doesn't feel robotic; it's conversational and context-aware. Unlike static voice AIs, we aim to make it feel like a real assistant. It's voice-based, context-aware, and emotionally intelligent. It adapts based on your tone, mood, and preferences. It can play multiple roles—a therapist, a tutor, a friend, a co-pilot. Take mental health. In the West, you go to therapy. In much of Asia, it's taboo. But what if you could talk to an AI that listens, understands your emotional state, and helps you process your thoughts? We're not trying to replace professionals; instead, we're augmenting the support system. Q: As a builder in the Web3 and AI space, how do you stay ahead of the curve? Manit: I'm not an engineer, but I understand financial and business models. That allows me to integrate AI strategically. We collect massive amounts of behavioral data, not personal data, due to GDPR, but enough to understand patterns. We then use AI to create upstream and downstream' mind maps' of user personas. For example, if you're a fan of LeBron James, we map all related content and products into your digital journey. It's like building an AI around your interests, behavior, and ecosystem. Q: That sounds like serious personalization. Why is hyperpersonalization such a big deal? Manit: Discoverability is the biggest pain point in digital platforms. We can remove that friction by using AI to dynamically change what you see based on your behavior. So instead of you searching, the right product or content finds you. Your screen becomes your mirror. Every time you come back, it's slightly more tuned to you. That's what increases engagement and retention. He chuckles, I genuinely believe we're heading to a point where AI could even know when you're hungry based on patterns, location data, and daily habits. That's where hyperpersonalization is going. Q: What tangible results have you seen from hyperpersonalization so far? Manit: It's incredible that the average time spent on our platforms increased from two or three minutes to almost 10 to 12 minutes daily because of personalization. That's nine additional minutes of engagement. Because people consume more content, they burn through mobile data faster. This means they recharge their plans more frequently, three to four times a month instead of once or twice. This directly translates to increased average revenue per user (ARPU) for our telco and data partners. So now, the partnership makes business sense; it's no longer just a cool tech demo; more so, it's real ROI. Q: What does this mean for users in emerging markets? Manit: Most of our users come from underdeveloped or emerging economies—middle and lower-income groups that make up about 90% of the population. For them, the value they earn through our platforms can feel like a secondary income stream. We take things like going out for dinner or a movie for granted, but for some families, this is a real financial boost. It empowers the already empowered, but more importantly, it uplifts those who live hand-to-mouth. That's meaningful. Q: What are the most untapped opportunities for enterprises with AI right now? Manit: There are three big ones. First, they have their internal data. Many enterprises collect data but don't structure it in sandboxes to study behavior. That's a missed opportunity. Second, AI can help forecast the next five years of their business. It can generate strategic product ideas or analyze competitors, giving product managers a head start and saving the company from investing time and capital in dead ends. Third is true hyper-personalization. Let's take gaming. You buy FIFA, and a million people play the same game. But your PlayStation knows how you play. Why doesn't it adapt the gameplay accordingly? If I'm getting better, the AI should level up, too. This not only enhances user experience but also boosts retention and in-game monetization. Q: AI is powerful but also complex. Given the bureaucratic hurdles enterprises face, how do you see them adopting it? Manit: Great question. Enterprises have their plates full with budget cycles, approvals, and public company disclosures. AI becomes another challenge to stack on top. So when we approach them, we don't ask them to change their entire system. We start a parallel thread about a small integration that proves our value. Then, slowly, they come to us asking what else we can help with. Over 12 to 36 months, our tools become embedded into 95% of their operations, including AI, ML, and automation, all without disrupting their existing ecosystem. Q: With so much happening in AI, what excites you most about the future of AI-native products? Manit: I always say, the AI market isn't a pond—it's the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans combined. What we're seeing now is just scratching the surface. One use case is driving. Say you're on a night drive and tired. The AI companion activates. You choose your mood: 'educational,' ‘business,' or just 'talk.' Maybe you decide to learn a new language during your commute. Since the AI retains your context and adapts, it's far better than static apps. It's a therapist, a study buddy, and a voice coach—all in one. But with that growth will come consolidation. We're in a collaborative economy now, not a monopolistic one. If we don't collaborate, we'll all get pulled back. And as AI becomes mainstream, it'll attract regulation, just like crypto did. Regulation will separate the real players from the opportunistic ones. Those who build compliant, ethical AI will scale. The rest? They'll fade. As the digital world leans ever more into AI, Manit Parikh and Binary Holdings are not just following trends but shaping them. With personalization as their north star and infrastructure as their foundation, their vision offers a glimpse into what the next generation of platforms could look like, including intuitive, adaptive, and deeply human.

LINK price has recorded a high correlation with Bitcoin price YTD, which is almost entering a parabolic bullish phase. The gradual Bitcoin (BTC) price rise in the past few weeks, has significantly influenced the wider altcoin market led by Chainlink (LINK). The highly anticipated crypto summer of 2025 has seen the overall capital inflow to the altcoin market experience a sharp uptick. Moreover, an imminent reversal and fall of Bitcoin dominance in the coming months will trigger a sustained altseason, fueled by FOMO traders. Chainlink Network Growth Outlook The Chainlink network has received significant adoption in the past few months amid the mainstream adoption of digital assets and web3 protocols. Furthermore, the Chainlink network enables DeFi protocols to provide reliable services in an interoperable ecosystem. Earlier this week, the Chainlink network announced a strategic integration with the Solana (SOL) network to enable its DeFi ecosystem to access Chainlink’s CCIP infrastructure. On Tuesday, several DeFi protocols announced a strategic integration with the Chainlink network to access its CCIP infrastructure. Some of the notable integrations include Zeus Network, Liquity Protocol, and Shift RWA. The continued adoption of the Chainlink products by institutional investors has bolstered the LINK token, which is used to reward node operators and data providers. Midterm Targets for LINK Price The large-cap altcoin, with a fully diluted valuation of about $15.7 billion and a 24-hour average traded volume of about $604 million, has been attempting to recover from last week’s 10 per decline. In the daily timeframe, LINK price has established a rising trend since April 9, characterized by higher highs and higher lows. Moreover, the LINK price has already broken out and retested a falling wedge pattern established in the first quarter of 2025. In the four-hour timeframe, LINK price has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, coupled with a rising divergence of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) . As a result, LINK price is well positioned to rally towards the next short term target around $19.8.",Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|LINK|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-20 23:52:27

But while these large-caps fight for renewed upside, one emerging name is gaining traction among serious traders: MAGACOIN FINANCE . Without needing flashy announcements or trend cycles, it’s steadily cementing itself as one of the most talked-about contenders in the 2025 lineup — and buyers are beginning to realize that this project is built to lead, not chase. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Bold Positioning, Relentless Confidence, and Real Market Presence MAGACOIN FINANCE is rising for one clear reason — it refuses to play small. In a sea of short-term meme projects and recycled narratives, this coin is commanding attention through consistent strength, focused branding, and clear long-term potential. Analysts are watching closely as sentiment consolidates around what many now view as a high-conviction opportunity for early entry . It is not just hype — it is becoming a headline project with all the traits of a breakout altcoin designed for this cycle, not the last one. Cardano (ADA): Whale Activity and Airdrops Keep Bulls in Control Cardano is showing solid structure on higher timeframes, fueled by whale buying and new layer integrations. With ADA hovering just below key resistance, analysts are forecasting a breakout toward $1.32 — assuming the recent momentum continues. Speculation around the upcoming Midnight airdrop is also fueling accumulation. If ADA clears the $0.80 barrier, upside movement could accelerate heading into June. Sui (SUI): Technical Breakout in Play With Strong Ecosystem Support SUI remains a trader favorite in the Layer-1 space, offering clean structure and growing DeFi traction. The token is consolidating near recent highs and is flashing early breakout signals, with analyst targets ranging from $6 to $7.70 . Sui’s ability to sustain user activity while attracting new DEX protocols makes it one of the more structurally solid plays heading into the second half of Q2. Polkadot (DOT): Undervalued Performer With Cross-Chain Advantage DOT is quietly climbing back into view, with multi-chain interoperability and renewed builder interest supporting its rise. Currently trending under key resistance, price targets for this quarter range from $1.05 to $1.30 . If market sentiment shifts in favor of legacy Layer-1s, DOT could reprice quickly — especially with increased attention on cross-chain infrastructure and parachain expansion. Final Thoughts Cardano is climbing on whales and incentives. Sui is technically primed and DeFi-proven. Polkadot is setting up as the quiet Layer-1 rotation pick. But while all three fight to reclaim past highs, MAGACOIN FINANCE is defining its own lane — and rapidly becoming one of the most confident altcoin bets of the year . In a market overflowing with short-lived speculation, this project is shaping up to be the coin built for staying power — and more investors are beginning to treat it that way.

While established players like Monero (XMR) keep their privacy edge and meme coins like Shiba Inu (SHIB) catch attention with quick price surges, newer projects are focused on creating lasting value. Web3 ai stands apart by offering a clear, structured roadmap for growth, aligning product development with investor opportunities. With upcoming releases for AI tools, mobile integration, and exchange listings, Web3 ai offers something unique. For those on the lookout for high-return crypto investments, this project presents an exciting, timely opportunity. What Could Push Web3 ai to the $1 Mark? Web3 ai is quickly becoming a top contender for the best crypto investment in 2025, and its momentum is impossible to ignore. With more than $4.3 million raised in just a matter of days, it’s clear that investors are already catching on. Currently in presale stage 5 at $0.000365 per token, the presale price will soon rise to $0.005242, meaning early investors could see returns of up to 1,747% before $WAI even hits public exchanges. What’s fueling the buzz? It’s not just the numbers, it’s the impressive roadmap Web3 ai has laid out. The team is rolling out a suite of powerful tools, including an AI trading assistant, ROI prediction engine, staking dashboards, and cross-platform API integrations. Plus, a mobile app is already in the works and is set for release just months after launch. But that’s not all, wallet and social media integrations, developer SDK access, and even plans for centralised exchange listings are on the horizon. As each milestone is hit, the demand for $WAI only grows, driving up the token’s utility and value. With a capped supply and a rapidly climbing presale price, the window of opportunity is shrinking fast. For those who want to maximise returns in 2025, now is the time to act before this presale phase ends. Monero’s Unmatched Privacy: A 2025 Standout Monero (XMR) continues to lead the charge when it comes to privacy in the crypto space. Thanks to its use of ring signatures, stealth addresses, and confidential transactions, Monero ensures total anonymity for users, from who’s sending the funds to who’s receiving them, and even the transaction amounts. This unwavering commitment to privacy has earned Monero a strong following among those who prioritise financial confidentiality. As concerns around surveillance and financial tracking continue to rise, Monero’s privacy-first approach is more relevant than ever. It’s not just about concealing identities; it’s about making it nearly impossible to trace any transactions. This has kept the interest high among users who want complete control over their financial history. With the growing importance of data protection, Monero’s privacy isn’t just an added feature; it’s a core principle driving its adoption. While other projects dabble with partial privacy, Monero delivers full anonymity by default, giving users exactly what they want: total transactional privacy. What’s Next After SHIB’s Gain? Shiba Inu (SHIB) recorded an impressive 14.48% jump this week, marking its best performance since late 2024. This surge came after a period of consolidation where SHIB found solid support at the $0.00001107 level. As buyers regained confidence, momentum picked up, and the token ended the week around $0.00001417. This upward trend indicates a shift in market sentiment and growing interest from investors. However, despite this recent gain, SHIB is still below its previous peak of $0.0000297, leaving plenty of room for potential growth. The next key resistance level to watch is around $0.00001698, which traders are eyeing closely. If SHIB can maintain this momentum, with rising trading volume and continued buyer interest, there’s a real chance the token could build on this positive trend in the coming weeks. All signs point to a recovery, and SHIB’s potential for further gains remains strong. Final Thoughts In a crypto landscape where trends come and go, true progress stands out. Monero (XMR) maintains its dominance in privacy, and Shiba Inu (SHIB) shows how market sentiment can fuel huge gains. But Web3 ai is carving its path, offering a solid, utility-driven roadmap with clear milestones. With a range of AI tools, a mobile app launch, and potential exchange listings lined up, Web3 ai is building a strong foundation before any major price jumps. As the AI crypto presale phases wind down and development picks up speed, it’s not just about speculation, it’s about tangible progress. For those aiming for top returns, catching this growth at the right time could be key.

This close, recorded just above the red horizontal line at $103,000, has introduced confidence in the continuation of the uptrend, and points to the bulls still in control of Bitcoin’s price action. Bitcoin Weekly Closes Above Range – First Bullish Step Current Bitcoin price action shows that bullish investors and buyers are still controlling the momentum behind the largest cryptocurrency and, in essence, the rest of the crypto market. Notably, Bitcoin initially experienced a brief surge to nearly $107,000 over the weekend before retreating. Related Reading: Bitcoin Macro Trend Oscillator Shows When To Expect The Price Top This price movement was followed by a dip to around $102,000, with the back-and-forth most likely being influenced by factors such as Moody’s downgrade of U.S. debt and investor reactions to potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. However, in an interesting note, the BTC price managed to close above the $103,000 range during this first move to $107,000, which is very important in terms of technical analysis going forward. This sentiment is echoed by crypto analyst Rekt Capital on social media platform X, who pointed out the next step that might play out for Bitcoin. Post-Breakout Retest Underway, Says Rekt Capital The $104,000 price level had previously acted as a stubborn ceiling throughout much of the recent Bitcoin price consolidation between $102,000 and $104,000 since May 9. However, since breaking above this level, the ensuing price action has seen the Bitcoin price retracing towards this level after another rejection at $107,000. Related Reading: Golden Ratio Multiplier Called Bitcoin Top In 2021 – Here’s What It’s Saying Now According to crypto analyst Rekt Capital, the dip following the $107,000 rejection isn’t necessarily bearish. Instead, it could be part of a post-breakout retest, a pattern often seen in strong bullish structures. If this retest successfully confirms the former resistance as new support, BTC could set the stage for a breakout into fresh all-time highs. As shown in the 1W Bitcoin price chart above, the red resistance level is very close to Bitcoin’s January 2025 all-time high around $108,780. Furthermore, the chart shows that the recent breakout above the $90,000–$103,000 zone appears to mirror a pattern of Bitcoin’s breakout after a consolidation move, after another bounce from a low. In this case, the bounce occurred at the $75,000 low in early April. If Bitcoin does rebound with enough trading volume around $104,000, this could provide the much-needed momentum for a move above $107,000 and finally above $108,700 again. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $105,555, up by 2.9% in the past 24 hours.

Pseudonymous analyst Bluntz tells his 318,200 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin appears to be forming a bearish divergence on the daily chart. The bearish reversal signal suggests that bullish momentum is waning even though an asset’s price is moving higher or sideways. Says Bluntz, “There’s a daily BTC bear div brewing here if it closes red by [today]. It’s unfortunate that it has appeared before fresh all-time highs, but it’s the first one since last year. Be careful with longs in my opinion.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $105,546. Turning to gold, the analyst believes that the precious metal is poised to ignite a rally to a new all-time high after completing an ABC corrective wave. Bluntz practices the Elliott Wave theory, which states a bullish asset will continue its uptrend after an ABC correction. The trader shares a chart suggesting that gold will rally to a new record high of $3,600. “Gold gathering steam for the next leg up here.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, gold is worth $3,221. As for the memecoin Floki ( FLOKI ), Bluntz predicts that the altcoin would dip to around $0.00008 before exploding to $0.00018. “Looks like FLOKI is one of the few memes with a clear impulse five-wave rise from the lows on the daily, indicating the low is in. Would be very interested in bidding pullbacks around the 50 fib if given. Have always had a soft spot for this one.” Source: Bluntz/X At time of writing, FLOKI is worth $0.000098.

While BTC dominates the headlines, the real growth potential often lies in low-to-mid-cap projects primed to outperform as capital rotates outward.From established names like XRP and Ethereum to surging contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Aptos, a handful of strategic plays are positioning themselves for outsized gains as institutional inflows rise and market sentiment strengthens. Here are four breakout candidates that could capture serious momentum in Bitcoin’s shadow. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Becoming the #1 Choice in 2025 SMART MONEY IS LOADING UP – ACT NOW MAGACOIN FINANCE is rapidly gaining recognition as a highly asymmetric early-stage opportunity. Still trading under $0.07, the project has raised over $8 million, with Stage 8 now live and buy activity surging. MAGA’s $0.007 listing target and scarcity-driven tokenomics have analysts calling for 34x–40x returns—and some models point to even more extreme upside if current momentum continuesWhat sets MAGA apart is not just its viral political narrative, but its transparent tokenomics, Hashex audit, and a presale structure that’s attracting both retail and whale capital. As Stage 8 nears completion, traders are calling this a rare chance to secure early exposure before MAGACOIN FINANCE hits exchanges . In a market searching for the next SHIBA or DOGE, MAGA’s combination of community energy, clear roadmap, and realistic price targets puts it at the top of many watchlists. Solana’s Technical Setup and Whale Accumulation Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $171.54, consolidating within a strong support and resistance range between $158 and $175. Analysts highlight a long-term Cup and Handle pattern forming, with a breakout above $175 potentially opening the door to $183 and beyond. SOL’s fundamentals remain robust, and smart money continues to accumulate, but as capital rotates, many investors are also looking to early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper growth while SOL trades sideways. Ethereum’s Bullish Breakout and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,531.95, up sharply from $1,800 at the start of May and now at a two-month high. Technical indicators remain bullish, with ETH above its 50-day EMA and forming a classic bull flag pattern.If ETH can break above $2,700, analysts see a move to $2,750–$2,900 in May and a year-end target between $4,392 and $5,925. As Ethereum’s rally matures, some investors are rotating capital into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater upside potential. Aptos: Quiet Accumulation and Upside Potential Aptos (APT) is consolidating after a recent event-driven rally, with analysts forecasting a price range of $5.13 to $8.81 for May 2025. While APT’s tech-first approach has strong backing, some early investors are rotating out profits in favor of lower-cap exposure.MAGACOIN FINANCE is benefitting from that shift, with many short-term speculators taking gains from APT and placing them into MAGA, where exponential upside still remains. XRP’s Futures Launch and the $100 Question XRP is trading at $2.36, with analysts watching closely as the CME Futures launch and ETF optimism fuel renewed interest. Legal clarity in the U.S. and growing payment adoption have analysts forecasting a move beyond $5 in the short term, with $15–$30 possible if key catalysts align.While a $100 price remains a stretch, the infrastructure being built by Ethereum, Solana, and new contenders like MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the real drivers of the next major run. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Conclusion With Bitcoin setting the tone for a powerful 2025, the spotlight is shifting to altcoins with strategic positioning and high-growth potential. Solana and XRP offer credibility and scale, while MAGACOIN FINANCE provides early entry with outsized return potential. Investors rotating now—before listings finalize and media attention catches up—may be best positioned to benefit from the explosive upside that defines every crypto supercycle.

This milestone will unveil the complete lineup of 20 crypto exchanges where BDAG will debut. Originally set for 10 exchanges, the expansion to 20 signals the growing confidence in the project. Buyers now have a chance to lock in BDAG at $0.0020 before listings go live. With over $258 million raised so far, this launch could reshape the Layer-1 market. The first five listings are already public: MEXC, LBank, CoinStore, XT.com, and BitMart. These platforms give an early glimpse of BlockDAG ’s broad market reach. The full list remains under wraps until the GO LIVE day, which adds suspense and urgency. More than just a listing event, this date marks the final chance to buy BDAG at a reduced price before its rates jump. For many, June 13 signals more than just a listing update, it’s a defining moment for 2025’s best performing crypto. BlockDAG GO LIVE Reveal: Strategic Importance of June 13 For anyone watching the crypto presale closely, June 13 holds serious weight. It marks the end of BlockDAG’s frozen pricing period at $0.0020. That fixed price offers early supporters a rare entry before listings push the coin into open market volatility. With the listing price set at $0.05, this entry window represents unmatched value. Returns since Batch 1 now sit at 2,520%, and more than 20.9 billion BDAG coins have been sold. As the current Batch 28 trades at $0.0262, the opportunity to still buy at $0.0020 before June 13 creates a notable advantage for those seeking gains on the best performing crypto of the year. This deadline is also pushing activity higher as more buyers aim to lock in their coins before the GO LIVE reveal reshapes BDAG’s pricing forever. Why This Exchange Launch Sets a New Standard Unlike typical launches, BlockDAG’s GO LIVE reveal showcases real progress, strategic alignment, and global exchange presence. With 20 confirmed exchanges, BDAG is not just appearing in the market, it’s entering with strength. Each listing brings access to broader audiences, liquidity, and exposure that many new projects never achieve this early. BlockDAG is also following through on its delivery roadmap. Miners have started receiving their X Series mining equipment orders, underlining the project’s commitment to real-world results. This kind of follow-through supports BlockDAG’s appeal as a long-term player in the space. Presale excitement continues to grow, thanks to the Buyer Battles and referral rewards program. These efforts keep the community engaged and encourage more users to participate before the deadline. As June 13 draws closer, BlockDAG looks increasingly like the best performing crypto entering the market this year. In Summary Mark June 13 on the calendar. It will be one of the most important moments of the year for anyone eyeing the best performing crypto before launch. BlockDAG’s GO LIVE reveal will confirm 20 exchange listings and finalize the $0.0020 entry price period. With over $258 million raised, over 20.9 billion coins sold, and a 2,520% ROI since Batch 1, BlockDAG is positioning itself as a standout in 2025. Once the listings are live, prices will likely react quickly. Until then, the opportunity to get in at a frozen price still stands. This is one presale that deserves full attention before June 13 resets the market dynamics.

Some are introducing new tools, expanding partnerships, or leveraging cross-chain solutions to grow their networks. These moves aren’t just about marketing hype; each coin here shows signs of actual traction. Those tracking the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025 will find this mix particularly engaging. The list features projects tied to AI, multichain access, and infrastructure development, offering a broad view of where value is forming. With Unstaked’s rollout plan, Cosmos expanding Ethereum access, and Sui bringing Bitcoin into DeFi, these assets are carving out strong narratives. Some launch major initiatives, while others aim to rebound after market dips. Every pick on this list presents a setup worth noting right now. 1. Unstaked: AI Utilities That Deliver Real Results Unstaked has been gathering momentum for its hands-on AI approach. The platform allows users to run AI agents that manage tasks like handling community posts and automating responses on Telegram and X. These aren’t inactive features; they’re judged by what they achieve, and rewards are based on their work. This system, named Proof of Intelligence, promotes active use instead of passive holding. Every interaction is stored transparently on-chain. With 60% of tokens offered publicly and no allocations for private rounds or VC parties, it gives broader access to early participants. Priced at $0.009267 in stage 13 and targeting a launch price of $0.1819, it reflects a possible ROI of 2700%. There’s also a $1 million prize pool campaign underway. Anyone purchasing at least $100 in $UNSD and completing social steps can enter to win $50,000, 20 winners in total. So far, the presale has raised $6.3 million, with $2 million collected in just two days. While some mention the platform has live agents, it’s important to clarify that these tools will only activate once the presale wraps up and the platform goes live. With a working model, strong interest, and transparent metrics, Unstaked deserves its place among the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 2. Sui: Bitcoin Utility and Expanding Features Sui has been pushing forward technically by linking Bitcoin-backed tokens into its ecosystem. Through a tie-up with Bitlayer, Peg-BTC (YBTC) can now be used within Sui’s DeFi framework, allowing BTC holders to earn through the platform. It also teamed up with 21Shares to support real-world asset applications. On top of that, Sui just crossed 8 million new wallet holders this month, which points to rising traction. With its current price near $1.85, down slightly for the day but up nearly 70% in a month, SUI still looks strong. Analysts believe the asset could move toward $6 if this pace holds. The addition of Axelar enables wider dApp development across chains. Thanks to fresh features and cross-chain potential, Sui earns a place on the list of fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 3. Cosmos (ATOM): Enhancing Access and Developer Reach Cosmos has made several updates that support adoption. It was just added to Bitbank, a top exchange in Japan, with zero trading fees during launch. That could draw new trading volume from Asia. But more importantly, Cosmos rolled out IBC v2, which improves how users and developers interact with Ethereum rollups. It makes multi-chain work smoother and cheaper, key for future growth. ATOM is priced around $4.90, with short-term charts hinting a drop toward $4.50 by May 18. However, projections for later this year point to a bounce to $6.80. With improved cross-chain tools and increased exchange access, Cosmos is set to stay on the watchlists of those looking into the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025. 4. Polkadot (DOT): Development Growth Despite ETF Delay Polkadot has seen mixed sentiment recently after the U.S. SEC delayed its decision on a DOT ETF proposal from 21Shares. This pause caused a slide below $5, and the price currently sits at $4.82, still struggling to break the $5.30 ceiling. Forecasts suggest a short-term dip to $4.45, with potential for a slow rise back to $5.15 later this year. But behind the scenes, development remains active. OpenZeppelin confirmed smart contract compatibility with Polkadot, which opens the door for more dApps on the chain. While prices are soft for now, continued work on developer tools helps Polkadot stay competitive. Its evolving ecosystem keeps it in talks among the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025, especially if ETF updates go positive. Final Thoughts! Momentum is forming across these projects. Sui is growing with Bitcoin integration and asset tokenisation, Cosmos is unlocking better Ethereum rollup access, and Polkadot keeps adding dev tools while waiting on ETF clarity. Yet Unstaked remains a standout, combining performance-based AI tools, a strong $6.3 million presale, and an open supply model without outside allocations. Anyone evaluating the fastest-growing cryptos in 2025 should keep these four in sight. Sui, Cosmos, and Polkadot all offer strong technical moves, while Unstaked adds an upcoming utility layer tied to real activity. With the launch still ahead, Unstaked also brings a rare entry chance before full rollout. These picks represent some of the sharpest plays in today’s market trends.

Experts warn that this blind spot could have serious consequences for Silicon Valley and the broader digital economy. Allianz Trade, an intelligence firm that tracks global trade risks, published a report on Tuesday based on a survey of 4,500 companies worldwide. It aimed to measure the impact of rising trade tensions and warned that a focus on the United States’ trillion-dollar goods deficit threatens to overlook the fastest-growing part of global trade, the “invisible exports” of financial and digital services. Though tracking these services is challenging, the report cites estimates showing a US digital trade surplus of at least $600 billion, including digital advertising, video streaming, cloud platforms, and online payment services. Digital surplus by firm (USD bn). Source: Allianz Trade Global Survey 2025 The report calls this “hidden trade immense”. It says these invisible exports have greatly outpaced the growth of goods exports over the past two decades, yet they do not show up in standard trade statistics. Allianz Trade warns that if Washington does not “rethink trade policy and narratives” to begin tracking these services more closely, it could undermine one of America’s innovative companies and massive data infrastructure, just as the president is negotiating deals with much of the world. The report stresses that overlooking this trade could leave US firms exposed to foreign retaliation. Furthermore, US digital exports now make up about 3.6% of all trade worldwide and continue to grow quickly. These unseen exchanges add to US trade revenues without filling any container ships. In today’s economy, routers and data centers are as crucial as ports and factories for keeping America in a leading position. Yet, President Trump’s current plan requires countries hit by his reciprocal tariffs to strike a deal by July 8, a deadline he admits may not allow talks with every partner. US trade partners are already exploring tariffs or taxes on digital services Experts agree that if these measures become permanent, they might damage the US tech industry and even split the internet by forcing companies to tailor their services to different regions. Jovan Kurbalija, a former diplomat and head of the DiploFoundation, warned in an April blog that a shift into the digital domain could carry “far-reaching consequences” for Silicon Valley and the global digital economy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirmed to the Financial Times last month that she is planning countermeasures if talks between the European Union and the United States fail. Those could include a tax on digital advertising revenues aimed at firms like Amazon, Google, and Facebook, as well as tariffs on services traded across the entire EU market. Kurbalija said that beyond Europe, Trump’s goods tariffs give other countries both moral and tactical reasons to fast-track digital taxes under the banner of “reclaiming revenue from foreign tech ‘free riders.’” Half of US firms considering more investment in China In an opinion piece , Neal K. Shah, CEO of CareYaya Health Technologies, warned that “tariffs on digital services would directly reduce revenues for American tech companies.” He said a full-blown digital trade war could harm the Internet’s infrastructure and force firms to operate “parallel digital universes with incompatible standards.” Shah said that means higher costs, less market access, and slower growth for startups and innovators. He added that splitting the digital world could end globally scalable platforms, scare away investors, and cut world GDP by up to 5% over the next decade. Trump’s answer to these threats remains more tariffs. He has said that “only America should be allowed to tax American firms,” Reuters reported . In February, he issued a memo ordering research into how to respond to digital service taxes, including new duties. Yet Allianz Trade found that many US firms are not returning operations home. Instead, half of those surveyed are weighing increased investments in China, while only eight percent plan cuts there. Others said they are rerouting supply chains to Southeast Asia, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Latin America. Experts like Bertin Martens of the Brussels think tank Bruegel say imposing digital services tariffs is hard in practice. Laws barring measures against platforms with a significant local presence require detailed user data. Some see open-source technology as the clear winner if tariffs force firms to seek alternatives that sidestep trade barriers.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, and XRP Could Lead 2025’s Political Crypto Boom",https://thecoinrise.com/500-to-7-figures-magacoin-finance-bitcoin-and-xrp-could-lead-2025s-political-crypto-boom/,"Introduction With Bitcoin regaining momentum, XRP drawing institutional flows, and Ethereum breaking out above key resistance, investors are zooming in on a select group of tokens set for major upside in 2025. MAGACOIN FINANCE is leading the charge—not just for its explosive growth potential, but because Stage 8 is now live and analysts are calling it a high-conviction 40x altcoin candidate. Kaspa (KAS) is also catching attention as its ecosystem expands, but the spotlight is squarely on MAGA, BTC, XRP, and ETH as the market pivots toward political and narrative-driven plays. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is the Coin to Watch Before Stage 9 CLICK HERE – ROI TARGET: 18,500% AND COUNTING MAGACOIN FINANCE is capturing serious attention as Stage 8 nears completion, with over $8 million raised and a hard listing target of $0.007. Unlike legacy coins where much of the upside is already priced in, MAGA offers structured scarcity, surging demand, and transparent price discovery. Analysts are projecting a 35x–40x ROI from current levels, with some models suggesting even greater upside if listing momentum continues. With each stage filling rapidly and community growth accelerating, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being treated as the final major entry before the price curve steepens and Stage 9 begins. Bitcoin: Macro Momentum and Political Narrative Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $103,405, having gained over 14% in the past 30 days and now less than 7% below the $100,000 mark. On-chain data shows demand rebounding, with major wallets accumulating as US-based ETF inflows stabilize. While institutional conviction is still ramping up, analysts see a plausible summer rally toward $150,000 if current trends hold. As the political narrative heats up in the US and abroad, Bitcoin’s role as a macro hedge and a political statement is drawing new capital—while early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE are benefitting from this shift in sentiment. XRP: Derivatives, ETFs, and Global Settlement XRP is trading around $2.39, with forecasts for late 2025 targeting $2.65–$2.80 if current momentum holds. The launch of CME futures and growing ETF speculation are fueling institutional interest, while whale accumulation continues to rise. Legal clarity and Ripple’s expanding partnerships are setting the stage for XRP to serve as a global settlement infrastructure asset. As institutional flows grow, many investors are also rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater upside. Kaspa: Technical Strength and Ecosystem Growth Kaspa (KAS) is trading at $0.097, showing resilience after its recent hard fork and ecosystem expansion. Analysts predict moderate gains this year, with a possible move to $0.15 if broader market conditions remain favorable. Kaspa’s unique blockDAG architecture and active developer community are positioning it as a standout proof-of-work contender, but for those seeking exponential returns, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as the more aggressive play. Ethereum: Breaking Out With Bullish Momentum Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,531.95, up sharply from $1,800 at the start of May and now at a two-month high. Technical indicators remain bullish, with a target range of $2,750–$2,900 for May and projections as high as $5,925 by year-end. Institutional adoption, Layer 2 advancements, and DeFi growth are all strengthening ETH’s long-term outlook. As Ethereum’s rally matures, smart capital is rotating into early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture the next wave of exponential returns. HIGH DEMAND, LOW SUPPLY – ACT NOW Conclusion Smart capital is converging around MAGACOIN FINANCE, Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum as the top altcoin picks for the 2025 bull run. With Stage 8 nearly complete, robust demand, and a clear listing roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year. The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

Gox claims to build Bitcoin treasury",https://cointelegraph.com/news/strive-targets-75000-bitcoin-in-mt-gox-claims?utm_source=rss_feed&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=rss_partner_inbound,"Vivek Ramaswamy’s Strive is looking to build its Bitcoin holdings by purchasing distressed Bitcoin claims at a discount, starting with claims tied to 75,000 Bitcoin at the bankrupt crypto exchange Mt. Gox. Strive said in a May 20 regulatory filing that it partnered with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to target claims to Bitcoin ( BTC ) that have received definitive legal rulings but are still awaiting distribution. The company said buying the claims would allow it to purchase Bitcoin at a discount and grow its Bitcoin per share ratio ahead of its planned reverse merger with Asset Entities — which is expected to be completed sometime mid this year. Strive hasn’t disclosed any Bitcoin holdings but claims it will face fewer restrictions on purchasing Bitcoin than companies going public through Special Purpose Acquisition Company mergers. Advantages of going public via a reverse merger compared with a SPAC merger. Source: Strive Strive said it would need shareholder approval to pursue Mt. Gox claims. The company said it intends to lodge a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission to outline the full terms of the proposed transaction. A proxy statement would then be sent to shareholders to seek their approval. Strive would need to obtain shareholder approval relatively soon, as Mt. Gox is expected to fully repay its creditors by Oct. 31. The Japan-based Mt. Gox was the largest Bitcoin exchange before it collapsed in 2014 from a security breach that resulted in the theft of approximately 750,000 Bitcoin . Strive’s pivot to become a Bitcoin treasury company reflects a broader industry trend as more firms look to hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets as a long-term strategic asset. Related: Bitcoin ETFs bought 6x more than BTC miners produced last week Twenty One Capital is another newly launched Bitcoin treasury firm that has received backing from the likes of Tether, SoftBank and Cantor Fitzgerald. The Jack Mallers-led firm plans to launch with 42,000 Bitcoin once it completes a blank-check merger with Cantor Equity Partners. Asset Entities shares rise again on Mt. Gox plans Asset Entities (ASST), a social media marketing company that Strive announced it would merge with on May 7 to create a Bitcoin investment company, has seen its shares close May 20 trading up 18.2% to $7.74, Google Finance data shows. The latest share price bump brings its market cap to $122.1 million, and ASST is now up 1,170% since Strive announced its merger plan. Strive is expected to own 94.2% of the combined entity once the reverse merger is complete, while Asset Entities will hold the remaining 5.8%. The merged companies will be named Strive and Asset Entities, and will still trade under the ASST ticker.

But while Dogecoin is popular, a new project called Ruvi AI is making waves in the blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) space by combining these two. Beyond its innovation, Ruvi AI is an investment opportunity you can’t ignore. What is Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI is a platform that brings together AI’s problem solving and the blockchain’s security and transparency. It’s for industries like healthcare, finance and logistics where there’s a need for better data analysis and decision making tools. Ruvi AI enhances these processes, optimizes workflows and delivers insights. A big milestone for Ruvi AI is the release of its Beta platform , where businesses and users can test its real world applications. Unlike many projects in the tech world that promise more than they can deliver, Ruvi AI is already showing its capabilities. Also Ruvi AI has announced that it has secured its first exchange listing , so its token will be publicly tradable. This is just the beginning as the team works to get more exchange partnerships to make it accessible to users and investors. Ruvi AI’s Presale Success Ruvi AI presale has been a huge success, Phase 1 sold out in just 2 weeks. During this phase early investors could buy tokens for only $0.01 , the price went up to $0.015 in Phase 2 . Market predictions say Ruvi AI tokens could hit $1 soon after listing. For investors this means an opportunity to buy tokens at a heavily discounted price before they potentially go exponential. Rewarding Commitment with Bonuses For early investors Ruvi AI offers incentives through its VIP rewards system , where token bonuses increase as you go up the more tokens you hold. This rewards structure is designed to maximize returns for those who show commitment. Here’s three investment scenarios: VIP Tier 2If you invest $750 at the current price of $0.015 per token, you get 50,000 tokens. By qualifying for VIP Tier 2 you get a 40% bonus, so you get 20,000 tokens more, total 70,000 tokens. At a listing price of $0.07 these tokens will be worth $4,900 , a 553% ROI . If Ruvi AI tokens reach the projected price of $1 the value will be $70,000 , a 9,233% ROI . VIP Tier 3 Invest $1,500 and get 100,000 tokens . By reaching VIP Tier 3 you get a 60% bonus , so you get 60,000 tokens more, total 160,000 tokens . At the confirmed listing price of $0.07 this will be $11,200 , a 1,020% ROI . If the token reaches its anticipated valuation of $1 the total value will be $160,000 , a 10,567% ROI . VIP Tier 5 Invest $7,500 and get 500,000 tokens . Investors who reach VIP Tier 5 will double their tokens thanks to a 100% bonus , so they will get 1,000,000 tokens total. At the listing price of $0.07 the value of your tokens will be $70,000 , a 833% ROI . If the token reaches the target price of $1 the value will be $1,000,000 , a 12,233% ROI . These examples show the benefits of participating in Ruvi AI’s presale and being an early investor. Leaderboard Rewards for Top Contributors Ruvi AI goes one step further by introducing a leaderboard rewards system . This feature offers additional rewards for top investors, more returns for them. Here’s how it works: Top 10 contributors will get 500,000 tokens , worth $35,000 at $0.07 or $500,000 at $1 . a Top 50 contributors get 250,000 tokens , worth $17,500 at $0.07 or $250,000 at $1 . Top 100 contributors get 100,000 tokens , which is $7,000 at $0.07 or $100,000 at $1 . This tiered rewards system shows Ruvi AI’s commitment to rewarding its most active and engaged investors. A Future to Look Forward to with Ruvi AI Ruvi AI is more than a project. It’s creating real world applications for its tech and offering great opportunities to its investors. With the release of its Beta platform and the announcement of its first exchange listing , Ruvi AI is on track to achieve its goals and deliver results. Investors who act now can get Ruvi AI’s presale token at $0.015 , benefit from its rewards system and set themselves up for massive growth.

With XRP gaining momentum from increasing institutional adoption and clearer regulatory standing, analysts are forecasting a potential 10x to 20x upside as global payment use cases expand. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance, still under the radar but rapidly climbing, offers early entry into what many believe is the next big crypto before the 2025 bull run peaks.

While XRP, Solana, and Bitcoin continue to dominate the top tier, one new contender is rapidly capturing trader attention: MAGACOIN FINANCE.With Stage 8 now live and inflows surging, traders from across the ecosystem—including XRP and Solana holders—are pivoting toward what’s now ranked as one of the most explosive breakout candidates of Q2 2025. Bitcoin (BTC): The Market Driver Holding Above $105K Bitcoin is holding strong at $105,941, up 2.8% in the last 24 hours and approaching new all-time highs. Institutional inflows are at record levels, with $6.9 billion entering U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs over the past three weeks. Major corporate buyers like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have added thousands of BTC to their treasuries, signaling growing confidence in Bitcoin as a macro asset. As BTC consolidates above $105K, capital is flowing into breakout altcoins—MAGACOIN FINANCE is now at the top of that list for traders seeking the next 10,000% run. CLICK HERE – 2025’S BIGGEST LAUNCH IS LIVE MAGACOIN FINANCE: The #1 Breakout Entry of the Moment MAGACOIN FINANCE is catching fire across presale trackers and trader dashboards. With Stage 8 nearly full, over $8 million raised, and a listing target of $0.007, analysts are projecting up to 50x returns as listings approach. Its scarcity-driven model—a capped 100 billion token supply, 45% in presale, and HashEx-audited contracts—sets it apart from typical meme coins.As capital rotates from majors, MAGA’s structure, community-first strategy, and strong early-stage momentum are making it the most-watched presale of 2025. For those seeking exponential upside, this is the entry window to watch. XRP: Futures Launch and Institutional Surge XRP is trading at $2.36 as of May 20, 2025, with the CME Group’s launch of XRP futures marking a major milestone for institutional adoption. While short-term volatility is possible, analysts see $5–$10 as the next major target, and some project $20+ if ETF approval and global settlement use cases accelerate.As institutional flows grow, many XRP holders are also rotating into early-stage tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE to capture sharper upside during this cycle. Solana: Whale Accumulation and Technical Breakout Solana (SOL) is trading at $166.71, consolidating after a sharp rally and drawing attention from large investors. Whale accumulation is on the rise, with three new wallets withdrawing over 145,000 SOL from exchanges in recent days.Analysts are targeting $200 as the next major resistance, with bullish technicals supporting further upside. As Solana’s rally matures, traders are diversifying into presale opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE for even greater potential returns. Ethereum: Quiet Build-Up and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,489, rebounding from recent lows and showing renewed technical strength. With Layer 2 upgrades, DeFi growth, and ETF speculation, ETH is poised for a potential breakout toward $2,750–$2,900 in the coming months.As Ethereum’s rally consolidates, early-stage projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are attracting investors seeking the next explosive move. TRON: Steady Growth Amid Market Rotation TRON (TRX) is holding at $0.124, maintaining steady growth as network activity remains robust. While not as headline-grabbing as some rivals, TRX’s consistent throughput and low fees make it a favorite in payment corridors.As speculative capital rotates, many TRX holders are also eyeing MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper early-stage upside. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Final Thoughts Bitcoin is steady at the top, XRP is gaining institutional exposure, and Solana and Ethereum are showing technical strength. But MAGACOIN FINANCE is building real pressure just beneath the surface. With Stage 8 nearly full, robust demand, and a clear listing roadmap, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the most compelling early-stage opportunity of the year.The window for entry is closing—and those watching closely know this could be the cycle’s defining moment.

Since tagging a local high on May 10th, DOGE has dropped over 18%, retracing some of the gains from its impressive rally that began in early April. Bulls had built strong momentum following the breakout above $0.13, which marked a 100% price surge within a month. However, recent price action suggests the move may be stalling. Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? The market now watches closely to see if Dogecoin can defend current levels or if further downside is on the horizon. According to top analyst Ali Martinez, the latest rejection has opened the door for a possible revisit to the $0.213 level — a key zone that previously served as both resistance and support. This level may now act as a magnet for price if bullish control continues to fade. While sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, the next move will depend on whether bulls can reclaim momentum or if DOGE breaks below its local range. The coming days could define the trajectory of Dogecoin’s midterm trend, with volatility likely to pick up. Speculation Rises But DOGE Faces Crucial Test During the recent correction that sent shockwaves across the crypto market, meme coins like Dogecoin were among the most heavily affected assets. As Bitcoin and major altcoins faced steep retracements, DOGE experienced an aggressive pullback, shedding over 18% since May 10th and erasing a significant portion of its earlier gains. This correction disrupted the bullish structure that had formed after DOGE surged over 100% from early April, following a breakout above the $0.13 mark. Despite the drop, speculation continues to mount around Dogecoin’s potential to lead if the market regains momentum. Historically, DOGE has acted as a high-beta asset, often outperforming in euphoric phases of the cycle. With the broader market attempting to stabilize, some analysts view DOGE as a likely beneficiary if sentiment shifts bullish once again. Still, risks remain. Price is now hovering just above key support levels, and a failure to hold this zone could trigger a deeper retracement. Martinez shared a technical view suggesting that if current levels fail to hold, Dogecoin may want to revisit the $0.213 level — a critical area that previously acted as a launchpad during the April breakout. The coming sessions are likely to be decisive. The meme coin narrative could regain strength if bulls reclaim control and push DOGE back toward the $0.26 resistance. However, if bearish momentum builds and DOGE breaks lower, it would signal a continuation of the current downtrend. For now, all eyes remain on this pivotal support zone as Dogecoin navigates a high-stakes moment within the broader market’s uncertain conditions. Related Reading: Chainlink Struggles At Key Resistance Level – $10 Support Back In Focus Technical Details: Dogecoin Facing Crucial Demand Dogecoin (DOGE) is showing signs of weakness after failing to hold above key resistance near $0.26 earlier this month. The daily chart indicates that DOGE is currently trading at $0.221, consolidating just above the 200-day EMA ($0.219) and below the 200-day SMA ($0.269). This range has acted as a battleground between bulls and bears, with the recent candles forming tight-bodied structures, signaling indecision. Volume has declined notably since the early May breakout, suggesting a loss of momentum and trader interest. If DOGE loses the $0.219–$0.220 support zone, the next logical support level sits near $0.213, aligning with analyst concerns of a potential retest of that level. A breakdown below this area could trigger further downside pressure toward the $0.19 zone. Related Reading: XRP Flashes Bullish Signal – Technical Indicator Hints At Imminent Rebound On the upside, reclaiming the 200-day SMA at $0.269 would be a significant bullish signal, as it would place DOGE back above long-term resistance. However, the current trend favors a cautious stance, especially amid broader market uncertainty and weakened sentiment across altcoins. Overall, the chart reflects a pause in bullish momentum and rising risk of a deeper retrace unless DOGE regains strength above key moving averages. The next few days could determine whether consolidation holds or turns into a full correction.

44877826,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=731657,1747789278,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/44877826.jpeg,Crypto’s high price: The global kidnapping crisis targeting digital wealth,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/cryptos-high-price-the-global-kidnapping-crisis-targeting-digital-wealth/,"Earlier this month, in a leafy suburb of Paris, a young woman and her toddler daughter were violently attacked and nearly abducted. The alleged motive? Her family’s cryptocurrency fortune . In a chilling new reality, digital wealth is no longer just vulnerable to hackers—it’s putting lives on the line in the physical world. Crypto owners are being kidnapped , tortured, and extorted across the globe. From France and India to Latin America and Nigeria, these incidents are rising with alarming frequency as criminals adapt their tactics to pursue a new high-value target: anyone visibly successful in the digital asset space. Crypto is providing criminals with a new type of target Crypto’s allure has always been its promise of autonomy, borderless wealth, and anonymity. However, that autonomy is becoming a liability for individuals who have struck it big. Unlike a bank account that requires bureaucratic steps to access, crypto wallets can be emptied in minutes—under duress. Michael Lyons , an anti-money laundering attorney at Clifford Chance, concurs. He holds, “Crypto transactions are more likely to escape the level of scrutiny applied to traditional banking systems.” In India, a Bengaluru businessman was lured to Lucknow under the pretext of a business deal, only to be kidnapped and held for a ransom of 10 million rupees. In Latin America, kidnapping crews with cartel ties have begun demanding ransom not in cash but in Bitcoin, often using privacy-enhanced coins like Monero to mask their tracks. One Venezuelan crypto trader, who asked not to be named, described being tailed for weeks before armed men intercepted him outside a mall. “They knew what I drove, where I lived, even which exchange I used,” he said. “They held my family until I transferred the funds.” Kidnappers have gone digital The rules of engagement have shifted. Where old-school ransom schemes might involve anonymous wire transfers or suitcases of cash, today’s criminal outfits are leveraging the technologies that gave rise to crypto: decentralization, pseudonymity, and global reach. According to a report by BankInfoSecurity , criminals are increasingly demanding ransom in Monero and other privacy coins because they are harder to trace than Bitcoin. “The privacy coins make the laundering process easier for them, so they obviously prefer it, but they will still accept BTC,” said a cybercrime analyst quoted in the article. In some instances, criminals are no longer waiting for the wealthy to become careless. They’re using facial recognition, blockchain transaction tracking tools, and even SIM swapping attacks to isolate targets. The lines between cybercrime and street-level violence have blurred. The Interpol has also reported increased coordination between cybercrime units and traditional law enforcement as crypto crimes cross national borders. These cases have created a new breed of hybrid criminals employing a mix of digital sophistication and brutal coercion to their nefarious ends. The crypto industry is taking notice Security, once an afterthought in the fast-moving world of crypto, has become a front-and-center concern. Executives and influencers are hiring private security firms, sometimes staffed with former intelligence operatives. High-net-worth individuals are relocating, installing panic buttons, and switching to encrypted communications. Amid a spate of kidnappings and the Coinbase hack, increasingly large crypto holders are hiring private security firms. Some investors have opted for a lower profile. They now conduct meetings virtually, scrub their social media of luxury photos, and use pseudonyms even within crypto communities. This stance is a far cry from the early days of crypto culture—where flexing wealth was part of the brand. Today, discretion is survival. Meanwhile, exchanges and wallet providers are reevaluating their user education practices. Physical security awareness campaigns now supplement tutorials on setting up hardware wallets and using multi-signature authentication. All these initiatives show that while a user’s seed phrase is important, so is their situational awareness. Combating crypto crime requires understanding that air-gapping your wallet is unhelpful if you broadcast your wealth through social media and other means. Law enforcement is playing catch-up While the threats are global, the responses have been fragmented. Law enforcement agencies often lack the technical know-how to investigate crimes involving digital assets. Jurisdictional challenges complicate matters: when a ransom is paid in France and funneled through wallets in Panama, who has authority? Some progress is being made. INTERPOL has launched a Financial Crime and Anti-Corruption Centre to address transnational financial threats, including crypto-related ones. However, international coordination remains a major hurdle. In the U.S., the Department of Justice has stepped up crypto training for its cybercrime units and partnered with blockchain analytics firms to trace illicit transactions. However, experts say the lag between policy formulation and technological evolution is widening. There is also debate about whether crypto platforms should shoulder more responsibility. Some argue exchanges need to implement AI-driven behavior detection systems that could flag suspicious patterns before funds are forcibly withdrawn. Yet privacy advocates caution against sweeping surveillance in the name of safety. They argue that we can’t sacrifice decentralization and privacy entirely to police bad actors. So, we must find ways of achieving that difficult balance. Crypto must address its cultural problem Beyond policy and policing lies a deeper cultural issue: the glamorization of sudden wealth. Crypto communities on YouTube, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter) are rife with images of Lamborghini, luxury watches, and high-rise living. This culture of conspicuous consumption has painted targets on the backs of newcomers and veterans alike. Some of the most at-risk individuals are early adopters who experienced 1000x returns overnight. Many are young, inexperienced with wealth, and unaware of the attention they’re attracting. To these investors, the rising number of crypto kidnappings shouldn’t just be another crime wave. Rather, it’s a wake-up call. They must understand that their success stories must come with robust identity protection, not flaunting their assets and always assuming someone’s watching them. What’s the way forward? As the crypto industry matures, so too must the systems around it. That means that investors need to take personal security as seriously as they take portfolio diversification. Platforms and exchanges should include user education on physical safety, not just cyber hygiene. Furthermore, l aw enforcement agencies need cross-border frameworks and technical expertise to respond effectively. But beyond systems and policy, a cultural shift is needed. We must move away from the glamorization of sudden wealth and toward a culture of security-minded, privacy-conscious engagement with digital finance. Cryptocurrency has opened the door to financial freedom for millions. But freedom, in this case, comes with a price—and for too many, that price is proving far too high. It doesn’t have to be this way.

Moreover, Unicoin advertised its rights certificates, including by promising outsized returns of up to 9 million percent, the SEC alleged, pointing to marketing efforts on taxi cabs, ferries, ""office building elevator screens,"" digital billboards, coasters, television programs, news websites and public wi-fi kiosks. ""Additional examples of the Promoting Defendants’ statements include: (a) social media and website posts that touted potential returns of 9,000,000% based on bitcoin’s 9,000,000% growth in the past 10 years and told investors to 'take advantage of the early days of Unicoin and get them today,' highlighting that 'Bitcoin experienced a tremendous rise in value, transforming early adopters into millionaires, and even billionaires,'"" the filing said.

New York City will also be exploring whether certain services and taxes can be paid via crypto, according to Adams, along with using blockchain tech to manage sensitive information such as birth certificates and death records . “Bringing blockchain security capabilities to the city means that birth certificates and death records can remain private but accessible to New Yorkers and their next of kin,” Adams said. “We want to bring jobs of the future to our city today. That means supporting the development of a more diverse, equitable, inclusive tech ecosystem. We must embrace this emerging technology and build on the success of our economy,” he added. Crypto legislation proposed in New York New York State lawmakers have already introduced several bills to regulate crypto. In April, Assemblyman Clyde Vanel introduced a bill to amend the state’s financial law to allow New York State agencies to accept crypto as payment. However, the legislation is yet to reach the state’s full House or Senate. New York state Senator James Sanders Jr proposed the Blockchain Study Act in February, which would create a crypto task force to investigate the current state of crypto in the State. It has yet to advance past the House.

He was indicted on corruption charges over alleged illegal donations from the Turkish government, but Justice Department officials stepped in and directed local authorities to intervene. The case was dismissed with prejudice on April 2, meaning it can’t be reopened. An increasing number of US states are also working on crypto-related legislation, with at least 18 considering bills to establish a strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Two states, New Hampshire and Arizona, have successfully passed the legislation, according to Bitcoin Reserve Monitor.

While the market has faced a few pullbacks, the bigger picture still looks hopeful for XRP fans. Key Resistance Holding XRP Back Recently, XRP tried to break through a tough resistance zone between $2.55 and $2.62, but once again, the price got rejected. This area has been a problem for XRP for a while now, just like it has for many other altcoins in the market. After this rejection, the price pulled back slightly, but it’s still holding above important support levels. The Bigger Trend Stays Bullish Even with these small dips, the overall trend for XRP is still moving up. On the daily chart, XRP continues to form higher highs and higher lows, which is a classic sign of an uptrend. Right now, the price is finding support around $2.30 to $2.34, a zone that was previously a resistance area. As long as XRP stays above this level, the bullish momentum is expected to continue. If the price falls below $2.30, however, the next important support sits between $2.10 and $2.15. Dropping below this zone could lead to a deeper pullback in the short term. Short-Term Price Action: Calm Before the Move XRP is still under the effect of a recent bearish divergence, which caused a small drop followed by sideways price movement. At the moment, it looks like XRP won’t make any big moves right away. Bitcoin, which often leads the crypto market, is still holding strong — and when Bitcoin stays steady, altcoins like XRP usually follow quietly for a while before making their moves. Many market watchers believe that if Bitcoin continues its upward trend, XRP could start recovering in the coming days. Elliott Wave Analysis Suggests One More Rally According to a recent market analysis based on the Elliott Wave theory — a popular tool to predict market cycles — XRP might still be in the middle of its fifth and final wave to the upside. This wave likely started when XRP hit a bottom in July last year. If this pattern continues, XRP could aim for new highs, with long-term price targets between $4.20, $5.00, or even $5.65 before a bigger market correction begins. Crucial Support and Resistance Levels to Watch (long term) For now, XRP remains in a tight range. Key resistance sits just above $3.30, while strong support lies at $1.21. As long as the price stays above $1.21, the bullish outlook stays in place. A drop below this level, however, would weaken the current setup and might force analysts to rethink their predictions. In the short term, XRP has completed a five-wave pattern, and according to Elliott Wave rules, a three-wave pullback could be next. The expected support for this pullback lies between $2.60 and $1.79. As long as XRP holds above $1.79, the bullish trend remains safe.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 01:46:19

Beijing placed fresh restrictions on seven key rare-earth elements and on the permanent magnets made from them. The minerals are crucial for electric cars, wind turbines, humanoid robots, and advanced fighter jets. Under the rules, Chinese exporters must secure a licence from the Ministry of Commerce before each shipment can leave the country. Exporters and trade bodies now say those licences are being approved at a slow pace. Some shipments to Europe have been cleared, but the pace is far behind demand. “The window to avoid significant damage to production in Europe is rapidly closing,” said Wolfgang Niedermark, a member of the executive board of the Federation of German Industries, or BDI. Big US manufacturers are also sounding the alarm. In recent briefings, executives at Tesla, Ford, and Lockheed Martin told investors that China’s new export controls could slow or even halt supply chains. One European executive based in China, who asked not to be named, called the present delays “untenable” for foreign firms. “What I’m witnessing on the ground is that there is really incompetence; they underestimated what the impact would be and what you would need to prepare at the working level,” the executive said. Beijing widened its export controls just after US President Donald Trump announced steep new tariffs on Chinese goods on 2 April. Many analysts saw the rare-earth move as a direct response, highlighting China’s leverage as the world’s dominant supplier of minerals. China’s rare-earth controls may be a strategic response to US tariffs So far, it is not clear whether any shipments bound for the United States have received licences since Washington and Beijing declared a 90-day ceasefire in their tariff war earlier this month. Yantai Zhenghai Magnetic Material, based in Shandong Province, confirmed it had secured export permits and had “resumed” taking orders from certain buyers. Two people familiar with the situation said at least one consignment destined for Volkswagen’s operations in Germany had also been cleared. Volkswagen stated that its supply of parts containing rare earths remained stable and that its suppliers had received “a limited number of these [export] licences.” Inside the industry, companies fear the ministry will be overwhelmed as licence applications pour in. One executive said European importers “are not sure how to prove” that their shipments will not be re-exported to the United States, a step that would break the permit rules. Slow license approvals would affect Western companies Tesla chief Elon Musk told investors last month that Chinese officials had asked for assurances that the rare-earth magnets used in the company’s robot arms would not go into military hardware. “That is an example of a challenge there. I’m confident we’ll overcome these issues,” he said. Permanent magnets made from rare earths are found in combat aircraft such as Lockheed’s F-35. Short-term shortages could disrupt production lines, and experts predict that the new controls will speed up long-term efforts in the West to build alternative supply chains. Evan Scott, chief financial officer at Lockheed, told investors this week that the company had enough rare-earth material for the rest of the year. He added that he expected US authorities to give priority to Lockheed’s needs “given the importance of our programmes.” Cameron Johnson, partner at the Shanghai-based consulting firm Tidalwave Solutions, said he believes some big companies with long histories in China have managed to move rare-earth cargoes even before their licences were formally approved. “There is still material going out,” he said. Cory Combs, associate director at Trivium China, a Beijing consultancy, noted that there is “certainly no evidence” that China has “bluntly cut everyone off.” With the 90-day tariff truce now in place, he expects the commerce ministry to grant more permits, but he warned that uncertainty remains high. “Everyone wants Mofcom to provide clarity,” Mr Combs said. “But China’s strategic leverage relies partly on the ability to pull the export control lever to the extent that the US does not provide a satisfying deal.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",News|USD|Yuan,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-21 01:48:29

It now requires one more vote and Governor Greg Abbott’s signature to become law. The bill draws inspiration from successful efforts in other states, notably New Hampshire’s model for adding new tokens to its Reserve. Under SB 21, Texas would allow altcoins to be included only if they maintain a market capitalization of at least $500 billion for a continuous period of two years. Texas is rapidly headed to form its own Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Legislators voted resoundingly to advance the bill. This legislation hopes to see Texas become the third state to own and operate a state-funded Bitcoin Reserve in the United States. The third and final reading would come next, and experts said that was likely to pass easily. SB 21 passes second reading with strong bipartisan support Upon its second reading, the bill, also called Senate Bill 21 (SB 21), received overwhelming bi-partisan support. The vote was 105 to 23. This demonstrates clear partisan agreement. SB 21 would allow Texas to join the handful of states that already hold Bitcoin by authorizing the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts to operate a state-owned Bitcoin Reserve. The fund will strategically invest taxpayer funds in Bitcoin to create a diversified financial portfolio for Texas, including digital and regular assets. To preserve the state’s investment, the reserve will be limited to digital assets with a market capitalization of over $500 billion held for at least two years, meaning only stable and established cryptocurrencies will qualify. The reserve’s operation will be funded through appropriations by the Legislature and other state funding sources. The comptroller’s office, which under the law is also guided by the city’s finance department and the Office of Management and Budget, will be the trustee of the currency and will purchase, hold, and sell Bitcoin on behalf of the reserve. Texas joins New Hampshire and Arizona in establishing state Bitcoin Reserve Texas is on its way to being the third state to create an official Bitcoin Reserve after New Hampshire and Arizona. This is just one example of an emerging trend in the US as more states turn to Bitcoin to help fortify their finances. Popularity has been rising for the initiative to hold Bitcoin after President Donald Trump suggested it was a good idea for states to hold Bitcoin; parties such as the South Carolina GOP found this a good time to ask followers to give their opinions. Supporters believe holding Bitcoin can enable states to hedge against inflation and economic instability. The cryptocurrency market has already felt the impact of news of the bill. Amid the state-backed interest in Bitcoin Reserves, the asset price has soared to $106,000, targeting an all-time high. Confidence in Bitcoin and state-led digital asset initiatives is steadily increasing. While primarily a Bitcoin Reserve, SB 21 also includes other digital assets—provided they maintain a market capitalization of $500 billion or more for at least 24 months. Texas set to approve Bitcoin Reserve as global interest surges The bill now heads to the desk of Texas Governor Greg Abbott, who is expected to sign it. Abbott has previously expressed support for cryptocurrency projects and is widely expected to sign SB 21 into law. Following Trump’s signing of the Bitcoin Reserve into law, interest in similar initiatives has surged to unprecedented levels. States like Utah, Oklahoma, and Kentucky are inching forward with their versions of a bill to join the industry as early movers. A Ukrainian lawmaker has unveiled plans to introduce a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve bill to be the first in the EU. However, the move has garnered Binance’s support, with the exchange poised to become a strategic partner for Ukraine’s Bitcoin ambitions. Additionally, Conor McGregor has plans to launch an Irish Strategic Bitcoin Reserve for the European country. The former UFC fighter has also scheduled a meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele to support a nationwide Bitcoin accumulation strategy. UFC fighter turned Irish political hopeful Conor McGregor has endorsed building a Bitcoin Reserve in his country to give more “power back to the people.” “Crypto in it’s origin was founded to give power back to the people. An Irish Bitcoin strategic reserve will give power to the people’s money,” McGregor wrote to X on May 9. He wants the Irish people to have a stake in this exciting venture. This suggestion immediately appealed to President Nayib Bukele, who is using aggressive tactics of purchasing Bitcoin for his country and disregarding any institutions that are hesitant in doing so KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",News|Bitcoin reserve|Texas,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-21 01:49:40

The ‘Amazon of Japan’ has noted it “will not enter the defense industry right away.” Given Japan’s self-described “defense geek” prime minister Shigeru Ishiba, a Christian, Westernized supporter of the U.S. military machine and Donald Trump, perhaps online shopping giant Rakuten’s recently announced support for actual weapons startups should not be too shocking.

Still, Rakuten, Amazon’s largest competitor in the land of the rising sun, isn’t typically viewed as being connected with such deadly endeavors. The multi-industry behemoth announced Tuesday it will be supporting Ukraine military startups via Brave 1, a Ukraine government organization.Support will come in the form of a dedicated booth at DSEI Japan 2025, which the press release calls (translated): “Japan’s only large-scale comprehensive defense and security exhibition.” DSEI Japan kicks off on Wednesday, May 21. DSEI Japan 2025 is a major military trade show that kicks off Wednesday in Japan. Source: DSEI . Rakuten’s move towards military involvement While massive corporations backing the governments they are embedded within is (unfortunately) nothing uncommon in war time, the Japanese state and it’s native commercial megaliths are headed more and more toward peacetime involvement in military matters.The currently debated “ Active Cyber Defense ” legislation pushed by Ishiba is just one example, which would see peacetime monitoring of communications from telecom giants like Softbank. This has some residents of the archipelago understandably worried they will be spied on and threatened by the preemptive nature of punishments outlined by the law.Six Ukrainian startups supported by Brave 1 will be showcased at the “Brave1 Powered by Rakuten” booth: • Dwarf Engineering LLC • FarsightVision LLC • Griselda • LifesaverSIM • Skyfall Industries LLC • Swarmer Notably, Skyfall Industries (what a name) makes a drone called “Vampire,” which according to Rakuten, “has earned a high reputation for its efficiency and versatility.” Anyone who has ever attended or seen footage of state-level weapons trade shows can attest to the bizarre and disturbing nature of the events. Military brass, mega-corporations, and politicians gather to toast champagne in celebration of killing machines. This likely has more than a few folks in Japan worried about the future of their beloved Rakuten. And more importantly, the land where they live. Still, Rakuten executive Hideaki Mukai has reportedly said at a press conference that his company “will not enter the defense industry right away.”DSEI Japan 2025 is held from May 21 to May 23 with Rakuten hoping to support the defense startups and “their entry into the Japanese market.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

He also rejected claims that the White House is easing military help for Kyiv. Rubio spoke in a Senate hearing one day after President Donald Trump spent two hours on the phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a call that ended without a clear step toward ending the war that began when Moscow invaded its neighbour. Several Democratic lawmakers said the president squandered the chance to raise the heat on the Kremlin. They faulted him for not warning Putin that Washington and its European partners would widen sanctions unless the Russian leader agreed to a cease-fire. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaking at a Senate hearing. Source: PBS NewsHour During testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Rubio was asked about a bill led by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. The proposal would slap wide-ranging new punishments on Moscow, aiming to choke the money it uses to fight the war. The measure calls for a 500 percent tariff on goods coming from countries that continue to buy Russian oil and gas, along with other limits on finance and technology. “If in fact it is clear that the Russians are not interested in a peace deal and they want to keep fighting a war, it may very well come to that point,” Rubio said. But he added that Trump thinks “right now if we start threatening sanctions, the Russians will stop talking. There’s value in us being able to talk to them and drive them to get to the table.” Democratic committee member Senator Jeanne Shaheen said Putin offered no “meaningful negotiation that would end this war in Ukraine.” She added, “As President Trump has admitted, Vladimir Putin is taking him for a ride.” Senator Chris Van Hollen went further, telling Rubio, “You’ve teamed up with President Trump to throw the Ukrainian people under the bus, and have been played like a fiddle by Vladimir Putin.” Rubio affirmed that the Trump administration has leverage against Russia Rubio insisted that the administration has the “same leverage today that we had under the previous administration.” He noted that “when Vladimir Putin woke up this morning, he had the same set of sanctions on him that he’s always had since the beginning of this conflict,” and he stressed that American weapons are still moving into Ukraine. “Putin hasn’t got a single concession, he hasn’t got a single sanction lifted,” Rubio said. Even so, the Florida Republican argued the war can end only through a negotiated deal. “What the president’s trying to do is end a war,” he told the panel, saying the United States must keep channels open so both sides will sit down. His remarks did little to calm allies who had hoped for tougher language in Monday’s Trump-Putin talk . The call produced no pledge from Moscow to halt its attacks. Instead, Putin suggested that both parties draft a “memorandum” that would outline future treaty terms, a move critics dismissed as a stalling tactic that allowed Russian troops to keep fighting while talks dragged on. European and Ukrainian leaders also voiced unease after Trump floated the idea of stepping back as mediator and proposing that the Vatican take over the role instead. They warned that every day without a truce brings more civilian deaths and damage across Ukraine.

But BlockDAG (BDAG) is changing that, making mining available to anyone through practical tools and mobile-friendly options. Whether you’re a full-time miner or just someone with a smartphone, BlockDAG opens the door to earning. With $258 million raised during its presale, 20.9 billion coins sold, and a 2,520% ROI since batch 1, the numbers are speaking for themselves. There’s a reason people call it the crypto with 20,000x potential. From BDAG’s Powerful X-Series Miners to X1 App, Mining Is Now for Everyone Mining isn’t just for those with high-end setups anymore. BlockDAG has created a toolkit that works for both pros and newcomers. The X10, X30, and X100 miners, over 17,600 units of which have already been sold, offer top-tier power and performance for serious miners. But the biggest shift is the X1 mobile app. With only a smartphone, anyone can start mining. There are no upfront fees, no complicated setup. That simplicity opens doors to a much broader user base, giving more people access to the crypto with 20,000x ROI potential. It’s smooth, easy, and perfect for beginners. What makes this important is BlockDAG’s focus on real-world usage. The X1 app isn’t just a gimmick, it helps grow the network and rewards users for activity, referrals, and time spent engaging. Even if traditional miners doubt mobile mining, BlockDAG’s hybrid PoW and DAG design ensures that every miner, big or small, helps power a strong, scalable system. Whether you’re using a $1,000 miner or a basic phone, you’re part of a broader mission to grow a decentralized network. A $258M Presale That’s Building More Than Hype BlockDAG’s rise isn’t driven by empty promises. With more than $258 million raised, 28 batches released, and 20.9 billion coins sold, this project is building real value. While the current batch is priced at $0.0262, a limited-time offer brings it back to just $0.0020 until June 13. That’s the same as the batch 1 price, offering late buyers a shot at early-stage ROI. This isn’t just about catching a dip, it’s about seeing an entire system in motion. The mining hardware is ready. The beta testnet is active. The X1 app is already gaining users. Unlike other projects that offer promises, BlockDAG is giving users an ecosystem to engage with before the mainnet even goes live. When you combine all this, tools, adoption, and accessibility, it’s easy to understand why people believe it’s the crypto with 20,000x potential. What also sets BlockDAG apart is its transparency. The team has rolled out multiple video keynotes, giving real updates on features, roadmap progress, and community milestones. That kind of openness gives both retail buyers and institutions confidence that they’re backing more than just a whitepaper; they’re backing results. Making Regular Users Active Earning Nodes BlockDAG’s smart approach to mining isn’t just technical, it’s about how people behave. Many crypto platforms struggle to bring in new users, and even more fail to keep them involved. BlockDAG avoids that by making mining fun and interactive with its X1 app. Users become active nodes by simply participating, earning rewards, making referrals, and competing in real time. A good example is the Buyer Battles contest, which hands out 150 million BDAG daily to the top participants. This adds fun and competition to the mix, turning mining into something people want to do daily. Instead of asking people to “learn” first, BlockDAG lets them earn while they learn. That strategy removes the usual barriers that stop people in low-income areas or those who aren’t tech-savvy. With mining options that include everything from pro-level machines to a free mobile app, BlockDAG is ready to grow fast and far. For people who care about more than just flipping a coin, BlockDAG offers a full system. It brings together technology, economics, and a community setup built around real use. This is mining made simple. And if BlockDAG keeps building this way, it may not only live up to the crypto with 20,000x potential, it could redefine what crypto utility actually means. Final Chance to Get In BlockDAG isn’t chasing crypto trends, it’s setting its own path. With physical miners from the X10 to the X100, and a user-friendly X1 app, it gives every user a way to mine and earn. The crypto presale speaks for itself: $258 million raised, a 2,520% ROI from batch 1, and a rare $0.0020 offer open until June 13. This isn’t just another presale, it’s the beginning of a bigger vision. If you’re searching for a real opportunity with long-term value, BlockDAG isn’t just a name to watch. It’s a chance to join something early, something real, and possibly the crypto with 20,000x potential ready to be realized.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Ethereum, and Solana Are Leading the Shift",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-next-big-move-magacoin-finance-ethereum-and-solana-are-leading-the-shift/,"Introduction As May 2025 unfolds, conviction-driven capital is flowing into a new set of crypto leaders . From institutional buyers to early-stage speculators, the spotlight is on four tokens: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), MAGACOIN FINANCE (MAGA), and Stellar Lumens (XLM). Each brings a distinct edge—macro leadership, DeFi infrastructure, early-stage asymmetric potential, and cross-border utility. But for those seeking the biggest ROI, MAGACOIN FINANCE is now the most aggressively positioned altcoin in the space. Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Being Backed for Major Returns CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming the top early-stage play of Q2 2025 , with Stage 8 live, over $8 million raised, and a listing target of $0.007. Its scarcity-driven 100 billion token supply and Hashex audit have analysts forecasting 35x–50x returns before listings.MAGA’s blend of viral narrative, transparent tokenomics, and a presale structure attracting both retail and whale capital is fueling unmatched momentum. As Stage 8 accelerates, those entering now are acting on a clear risk-reward model, not just hype. The window for early entry is closing fast, and MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly ranked as the #1 altcoin presale for 2025. Bitcoin Holds Ground as Institutional Confidence Grows Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at $95,000, consolidating after a strong recovery from April lows. Analysts are targeting $104,000–$109,000 as key resistance, with the next leg of the supercycle potentially pushing BTC to $150,000 or higher.As Bitcoin anchors the market, it’s enabling capital to cascade into high-upside altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE, where the opportunity for exponential gains remains open. Ethereum: Technical Breakout and DeFi Expansion Ethereum (ETH) is trading at $2,356, retreating from its recent high of $2,728 but still up significantly for May. Technical analysis points to a potential retest of $2,600–$2,700 if ETH holds above $2,250, with long-term targets as high as $4,500 by late 2025.As the cornerstone of Web3 and DeFi, Ethereum’s rising institutional interest and rapid Layer 2 adoption continue to bolster its outlook. Solana: Ecosystem Growth Drives Major Momentum Solana (SOL) is trading at $162.08, reflecting a modest pullback after recent highs near $183. For May 2025, the expected trading range is $158–$175, with a breakout above $175 potentially leading to a retest of $183 resistance. Solana’s positive trend remains supported by DeFi growth, Web3 participation, and strong investor confidence. Stellar Lumens: Quiet Utility and Cross-Border Reach Stellar Lumens (XLM) is quietly gaining traction as a cross-border payments leader. While not as headline-grabbing as BTC or ETH, XLM’s consistent utility and adoption make it a favorite for those seeking stable, long-term growth.As capital rotates, some XLM holders are also looking to MAGACOIN FINANCE for sharper, early-stage upside. EARLY ACCESS ENDING SOON – ACT NOW Conclusion The smart money in May 2025 is moving with conviction—rotating into tokens with strong fundamentals, clear narratives, and explosive upside potential. Bitcoin and Ethereum provide the foundation, Solana and XLM offer scale and utility, but MAGACOIN FINANCE stands out as the strategic early entry for those seeking life-changing returns.With Stage 8 heating up and listings on the horizon, this could be the defining moment to secure a position before the next wave begins.

Asked why ETH had rallied over 50% in a week, Hayes dismissed technical triggers and pointed instead to sentiment. “The most hated asset goes up the fastest in the next cycle,” he said. “It’s just human nature.” For Hayes, the Ethereum comeback was long overdue after years of being overshadowed by Solana and other high-beta tokens. “ETH was kind of dead. Everyone hated it. The BTC/ETH ratio was falling, Solana was running… it was time.” Why Ethereum Could Soar To $10,000 Despite not having added to his position, Hayes said he remained long Ethereum and was unfazed by the current price. “It’s great it’s going up, but okay—let’s talk at $10,000 or $15,000. Let’s talk when it’s meaningful.” Related Reading: Ethereum Flashes Golden Cross Signal – Can Bulls Push ETH To $3,000? Hayes placed Ethereum’s rebound in the broader context of what he calls a global monetary “phase shift”—a transition away from the US Treasury as the world’s reserve asset, toward a bifurcated system where store-of-value flows increasingly shift toward gold and Bitcoin. In this paradigm, Ethereum benefits not just from speculative risk flows, but also from structural changes in how capital moves under increasing financial repression and capital controls. While he reiterated his belief that gold and Bitcoin are the two neutral reserve assets in a politically fractured world, Hayes sees Ethereum as a powerful high-beta trade in the coming wave of liquidity expansion. “They print the money,” he said bluntly. “And the consequence will be gold and Bitcoin going through the roof.” Still, Ethereum’s path won’t be linear. Hayes acknowledged ETH’s underperformance versus Bitcoin so far, but suggested that ETH’s moment is coming—particularly if regulatory clarity improves or if decentralized finance regains traction with sustainable cash flows. He singled out projects like EtherFi and Pendle as examples of token ecosystems that might finally justify valuation through fundamentals. Related Reading: Ethereum Headed For Crucial Encounter At $4,000 – Here’s Why The potential for Ethereum to outperform dramatically remains, Hayes argued, especially as the market continues to digest what he sees as the beginning of the end for the 50-year US Treasury-based global financial system. “If you want to preserve access to capital and spend it how you want, the only things you can own are gold and Bitcoin,” he said. But for the investor with appetite for asymmetry, ETH is “a hard slog” now—yet still in the early stages of what could be a runaway rally. Whether Ethereum reaches the $10,000 mark in 2025 or beyond, Hayes is positioning for that outcome. “Mailstream is about 60% Bitcoin, 20% ETH and then you know a lot of other shitcoins and term sheets of token deals and stuff. On my non-crypto stuff, it’s physical gold and gold miners and T bills. That’s it,” Hayes revealed. At press time, ETH traded at $2,477.

What Happened? The SEC claims that Unicoin and its leaders, including CEO and Board Chairman Alex Konanykhin, board member Silvina Moschini, and former Chief Investment Officer Alex Dominguez, tricked investors with big promises about their crypto project. They sold “rights certificates” that were supposed to give people access to Unicoin tokens in the future — tokens they claimed would be backed by valuable real estate and investments in private companies. But according to the SEC, these promises were mostly made up. The real estate the company bragged about was worth only a small portion of what was advertised, and the company raised nowhere near the $3 billion it claimed — bringing in only about $110 million from over 5,000 investors. Unicoin reportedly went big with their marketing. Ads popped up in airports, taxis across New York City, on TV, and all over social media. The company presented itself as a next-generation crypto investment opportunity, supposedly safe, stable, and profitable. They even told investors their offerings were “SEC-registered,” when in reality, they weren’t. The SEC says Konanykhin personally sold millions of these certificates, targeting investors the company had previously tried to avoid so they wouldn’t lose their legal exemptions. The Charges and What’s Next The SEC has officially charged Unicoin and its executives with breaking federal securities laws, including fraud and making unregistered sales. The legal action demands they pay back the money they gained unfairly, along with extra fines and bans from holding executive positions in public companies. Even Unicoin’s general counsel, Richard Devlin, wasn’t spared. He’s been accused of spreading misleading information through investor documents. Devlin has agreed to settle his charges without admitting or denying the allegations and will pay a $37,500 penalty.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 02:01:11

The premiere episode featured Justin Sun, Advisor to HTX, who provided an in-depth discussion on several recent platform highlights. These included the launch of the “Mars Program Special Edition,” the early partnership with the Trump family’s crypto project, and the powerful growth drivers contributing to HTX’s Q1 performance. According to Justin, this new series underscores HTX’s commitment to transparency and building trust within its user base. By engaging directly with users, HTX intends to facilitate open communication, strengthen the connection between users and leadership, and enhance the platforms’ credibility. HTX representative Molly also participated in the show, directly addressing user questions in real-time. Q: The launch of HTX’s special edition Mars Program has sparked significant buzz within the crypto community. What’s the strategic thinking behind it, and what message does HTX hope to convey to users through this campaign? Justin Sun: A journey to Mars is actually a personal dream of mine. Interestingly,the Chinese names HTX and Mars form a natural alliteration. My lifelong dream has been to venture into space, a goal I’ve been pursuing incrementally. While sending myself or our users to Mars is not currently feasible, it remains a vision I hope to witness in my lifetime. For now, the first step is space travel. Acknowledging its niche appeal, I believe it’s a pursuit worth sharing with the HTX community. If there’s ever an opportunity, I aspire to offer our users the chance to experience space as well. Of course, this is a massive undertaking and not something that will happen overnight. My own space journey has already been delayed over four years. So managing expectations is important. That said, our investment in the space sector is long-term. Our collaboration with companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin is a long-term partnership. Safety is paramount, both in space exploration and in cryptocurrency trading. In the context of spaceflight, our benchmark for safety exceeds that of driving a car. Therefore, I want to emphasize three key aspects of this initiative: its inherent difficulty, its long-term nature, and our unwavering commitment to safety. Our focus on space does not imply any deceleration in our core product development. On the contrary, HTX remains aggressive and ahead of the curve in new asset listings. As a Top 10 exchange, HTX possesses both significant momentum and established credibility. Regarding the speed and quality of token listings, our competitiveness matches, if not surpasses, that of any other exchange in the market. The Mars Program symbolizes our vision for the future, reaching for the stars and beyond. Simultaneously, we remain firmly grounded in our commitment to our community. Our ongoing reward campaigns and $HTX token empowerment initiatives continue to operate at full capacity, delivering tangible value to our users. Q: You partnered with the Trump family’s crypto project, WLFI and you engaged in a discussion with Eric Trump in Dubai. At the same time, HTX was among the first exchanges to list Trump-related tokens, TRUMP and USD1. How do you view the value of this rapid response to trending topics in terms of brand building and user base expansion? And looking ahead, will HTX continue to double down on hot-red tokens? Justin Sun: Absolutely. We were one of the earliest players to recognize the significance of the Trump family’s involvement in crypto. From the beginning, I believed that Donald Trump’s influence would bring a huge wave of positive momentum into space, and now we’re seeing that come to life. The entire industry got a new lease on life after his campaign ramped up. I am honored to serve as an advisor to the Trump family’s crypto team. I’m actively involved in providing insights and helping bridge the gap between crypto and traditional politics and, in a broader sense, possibly even between the two major economies. Our objective is to establish a robust, long-term relationship with the Trump family and onboard individuals from traditional industries into Web3. Our partnership with the Trump family is a long-term commitment. We are dedicated to driving growth across the entire cryptocurrency industry, fostering greater adoption and integration of digital assets. Q: HTX was the only Top 10 exchange to record positive trading volume growth in the first quarter of this year. Could you share more insights into HTX’s current revenue performance and identify the key sectors driving this growth? Justin Sun: I’m confident that as long as HTX stays on the right course, sustainable growth will follow. Our strong brand influence, coupled with our established reputation as a veteran exchange, fosters deep and enduring trust among our user base.. The platform also benefits from significant organic traffic and demonstrates robust growth momentum, further solidifying our position in the industry. What sets us apart is our unwavering focus on doing what’s right, especially in security and risk controls. HTX has maintained an unblemished security record for over twenty months, a significant accomplishment considering the frequency of security breaches within the industry. This exemplary standard remains our top priority. We will soon launch a major win-back campaign for dormant users. If you’ve been away from HTX, there’s never been a better time to come back and rediscover what we offer. The “Real Talk with HTX Executives” program was conceived based on my conviction that security is the paramount concern for cryptocurrency users. A lack of public engagement from exchange leadership can potentially erode user trust. This on-camera series will enable HTX executives to speak directly to our users, share important updates, and listen to their thoughts and concerns firsthand. This commitment to open communication is fundamental to how HTX continuously builds and reinforces user trust. There’s nothing quite like the trust that comes from face-to-face interaction. Direct dialogue between executives and users plays a vital role in fostering mutual confidence and reinforcing user trust in the platform’s products and services. It’s something I consider paramount. In response to inquiries about the future role of exchanges and HTX’s potential redefinition of the “trading platform,” HTX representative @HTX_Molly provided her insights. She explained that HTX is evolving beyond the traditional exchange model, aiming to be a builder driving the industry’s long-term progress rather than a “crypto arcade”. By cultivating DAO culture and prioritizing community engagement, HTX is forging deeper connections among miners, developers, and users. This collaborative approach aims to facilitate the integration of Web3 from its current niche into mainstream adoption through genuine consensus-building. She stressed that “daily incremental progress is not just a slogan.” Writing solid code and providing comprehensive user support are the foundations for reshaping what an exchange can be. For HTX, rankings and short-term recognition are secondary; user trust is the platform’s most valuable asset. As she put it, “We prefer to move forward slower, ensuring that every brick we lay can withstand the test of a bull market.” Addressing a user’s question about “How does $HTX compare to other exchange tokens?”, Molly explained, “$HTX is like HTX’s stock, backed by solid fundamentals rather than speculation. Rigorous asset selection and a flawless security record are its core strengths.” Discussing HTX’s global expansion strategy, Molly conveyed a sense of certainty and emphasized that cultivating authentic, empathetic relationships with users takes precedence over the pursuit of rankings. “The joy our users feel from earning profits is our KPI,” she stated. With Justin Sun’s recent efforts to expand HTX’s reach into the U.S. market, the exchange is making a strategic move to send a global message — that Chinese exchanges offer not only speed, but also conviction and long-term vision.

Recent market indicators paired with bullish sentiment have reignited interest in XRP, with several analysts and community participants aligning around an optimistic outlook for 2026. The combination of improving technicals, upward revisions in price forecasts, and a solid support level near $2.37 is adding strength to the broader narrative. According to Binance’s latest forecast model, XRP is projected to hit $2.495738 in 2026, reinforcing the growing attention toward this established asset. This momentum, coupled with technical alignment on both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, positions XRP favorably in the coming quarters, especially in a market steadily regaining volume. Meanwhile, Qubetics continues to garner attention among early buyers as its QubeQode-powered infrastructure offers meaningful utility beyond speculative narratives. With more than $17.1 million already raised in its ongoing presale and over 513 million $TICS tokens sold, this rising contender is defining what the next generation of blockchain platforms should look like. As XRP builds toward new milestones, Qubetics is making its own mark through structured innovation, measurable ROI potential, and developer-centric functionality tailored for real-world application. XRP Price Prediction 2026: Growing Technical Strength Backs Forecasts The current price of XRP stands at $2.376894 as of May 20, 2025. Market participants appear increasingly confident that XRP will continue to move upward, supported by a strong “Very Bullish” consensus rating from over 56% of 774 voters on Binance’s sentiment tracker. The token has demonstrated steady performance, with predictions for May 2026 setting a potential price level at $2.495738. This aligns with a broader pattern suggesting gradual upward movement through 2030, where the token could reach as high as $3.033586. Several factors support this projection. XRP’s 50-day moving average is currently sloping up, and its 200-day moving average began to tilt positively as of May 15, 2025. This shift confirms a structurally bullish condition across both short-term and long-term indicators. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) also reflects a neutral stance, residing between 30 and 70, with no recent divergence, which reinforces a stable continuation of trend rather than imminent reversal. With no major resistance in the short term and supportive fundamentals in place, the mid-range XRP price prediction 2026 appears technically justified. Sentiment and Forecasts: How Users Are Aligning on XRP’s Trajectory The market consensus on XRP continues to build momentum heading into 2026. According to the platform data, the forecast curve suggests moderate but consistent growth. Users who participated in Binance’s predictive tool indicated a strong probability that XRP may trade near or above $2.495738 within the next year. Price expectations for subsequent years extend to $2.620525 in 2027, $2.751551 in 2028, and above $3.03 by 2030. These figures indicate growing long-term confidence in XRP’s capacity to regain ground lost during earlier consolidation phases. On a shorter horizon, XRP is forecasted to gradually rise over the next month, with a target of $2.386444 by June 19, 2025. This reflects a potential gain of approximately 0.4% in 30 days based on current trends. While these increases may appear modest compared to newer, more volatile assets, XRP’s appeal lies in its structural resilience and consistently improving base metrics. For long-term participants aiming to avoid speculative volatility, XRP offers a more measured profile with clearly defined growth projections. That makes XRP price prediction 2026 particularly relevant for those evaluating projects with trackable historic data and tested network performance. Technical Foundations Remain Stable Heading into the Next Cycle From a technical perspective, XRP continues to maintain structural integrity across major timeframes. The alignment of both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages signals growing market stability. Importantly, there are no recorded bullish or bearish divergences in the RSI readings for the past 14 candles, which indicates the absence of trend reversal warnings. These conditions support the ongoing forecast of steady upward pressure, aligning with XRP price prediction 2026 across multiple sources. Price target models reinforce the technical readings. Whether viewed through daily forecasts or multi-year projections, the token’s valuation model suggests incremental but meaningful progression. The broader sentiment indicators and predictive analytics all point to XRP potentially solidifying its place among the most structurally sound digital assets over the next 12–18 months. While the asset may not deliver triple-digit returns in short order, its position as a value-retaining asset continues to strengthen, particularly as broader crypto sentiment recovers. Qubetics Is Reinventing Utility Through the QubeQode IDE and Tokenized ROI Design As XRP builds on its technical base, Qubetics is capturing attention for an entirely different reason: real-world functionality tailored for builders, freelancers, and enterprises. At the center of its offering is the QubeQode IDE, a visual development environment designed to make decentralized application development accessible without technical complexity. Through drag-and-drop components, pre-built user authentication modules, and token management tools, QubeQode transforms the blockchain development process into something practical—even for non-engineers. This functionality is especially impactful for freelancers and small businesses looking to deploy secure, blockchain-based apps without incurring the cost of traditional backend development. Form-based configuration allows users to define application logic visually, while the embedded code snippet library speeds up development with tested components. Enterprises seeking to automate workflows, secure user authentication, or tokenize internal systems are now evaluating Qubetics as a functional alternative to expensive Web2 platforms. With its mainnet launch expected in Q2 2025, this initiative is gaining traction as more users discover the depth behind its technology stack. The Qubetics presale has also emerged as one of the most discussed initiatives among those looking for entry into the best crypto presale opportunities of 2025. Each presale stage lasts precisely seven days and ends every Sunday at 12 a.m., followed by a 10% increase in token price. Currently in Stage 35, Qubetics is priced at $0.2785 per $TICS token. Over $17.1 million has already been raised, and more than 513 million tokens have been distributed to a growing base of over 26,700 holders. What makes the Qubetics presale particularly compelling are the ROI projections associated with various post-launch scenarios. If $TICS reaches $1, buyers entering now would lock in a 258.95% return. A $5 valuation after mainnet would equate to 1,694.74% ROI, while a $6 price projects a 2,053.68% return. Should $TICS hit $10 after its utilities roll out, that return jumps to 3,489.47%, and a $15 outcome would deliver an exceptional 5,284.21% ROI. For example, a $5,000 investment in Stage 35 currently buys 17,950 tokens. If $TICS were to reach just $5, the total value of this holding would be $89,750. At $10, that climbs to $179,500, and at $15, the portfolio’s value would reach $269,250. These numbers underline why community participants are recognizing Qubetics as not only a technology project but a serious ROI proposition under the best crypto presale conditions currently available. Conclusion XRP continues to deliver a case for long-term confidence through well-aligned technical indicators and structured forecasts, with the XRP price prediction 2026 providing a compelling reason for its re-evaluation. Its consistent support near the $2.37 mark, combined with bullish market sentiment and upward-trending moving averages, strengthens its position as a viable hold through the next cycle. Meanwhile, Qubetics is defining a new direction for crypto adoption through developer empowerment and a clearly structured presale model. The QubeQode IDE offers immediate use cases for a range of users, while the $TICS token provides tangible ROI pathways for participants entering now. As the countdown to its Q2 mainnet launch continues, more buyers are choosing to join this best crypto presale ahead of the next round of price increases.

Ở bài trước, chúng ta đã khám phá cách MACD giúp bắt kịp đà tăng sớm. Hôm nay, hãy cùng tìm hiểu một công cụ được lòng trader nhất để hoàn thiện kỹ năng bắt trend thị trường: RSI – người bạn đồng hành không thể thiếu trong mọi giao dịch! RSI Là Gì? RSI (Relative Strength Index) – hay còn gọi là Kim Chỉ Nam Tâm Lý Thị Trường – là một công cụ đơn giản nhưng cực kỳ mạnh mẽ. Nó giúp bạn biết liệu thị trường đang quá hưng phấn (quá mua ) hay quá chán nản (quá bán ). Khác với các chỉ báo chạy theo giá, RSI đo lường áp lực mua/bán dựa trên biến động gần đây. Điều này giống như việc bạn có một chiếc radar phát hiện tâm lý đám đông trước khi thị trường lật kèo vậy! Giải Mã RSI Theo Cách Dễ Hiểu Nhất: ● RSI trên 70 = Quá Mua → Thị trường có thể sắp hạ nhiệt ● RSI dưới 30 = Quá Bán → Thị trường có thể sắp bật dậy ● RSI giữa 40–60 = Trạng thái Chill → Chưa có tín hiệu gì hot! Ví dụ đơn giản: RSI (Bảng Màu Tím): Cảnh Báo “Quá Mua” Trong biểu đồ trên, RSI của 14 cây nến gần nhất vượt ngưỡng 70 , báo hiệu trạng thái quá mua cổ điển . Điều này cho thấy đợt tăng giá gần đây của BTC có thể đang mất đà hoặc chuẩn bị bước vào giai đoạn điều chỉnh. Các trader hiện đang quan sát: RSI giảm xuống dưới 70 như dấu hiệu đầu tiên của đảo chiều. Nếu BTC vẫn giữ vững, RSI có thể duy trì trạng thái quá mua – một đặc điểm thường thấy trong xu hướng tăng mạnh (nhưng rủi ro cao cho người mua muộn). RSI càng mạnh mẽ hơn khi kết hợp với các chỉ báo khác. Hãy thử ghép đôi nó với MACD và Đường Trung Bình Động để xác nhận tín hiệu tốt hơn nhé! MACD: Động Lực Tăng Vẫn Còn Nguyên MACD Line (Xanh): 4,142 Signal Line (Cam): 3,536 Histogram: Dương, nhưng các thanh đang dần co lại, cho thấy động lực có thể đang chậm lại. MACD vẫn tích cực với đường xanh nằm thoải mái trên đường cam, nhưng hãy chú ý đến histogram. Nếu các thanh bắt đầu thu hẹp, đó có thể là dấu hiệu rằng động lực tăng đang suy yếu. Đường Trung Bình Động: Liệu BTC Có Quá Mở Rộng? ● 50-Day EMA (Đường Vàng): 92,570 ● 200-Day SMA (Đường Xanh): 91,673 Giá BTC đang giao dịch cao hơn cả hai đường trung bình động chính, xác nhận xu hướng tăng mạnh mẽ. Tuy nhiên, điều này cũng đặt ra vấn đề: Liệu thị trường có đang quá căng? Khi giá kéo xa khỏi các đường này, một đợt điều chỉnh lành mạnh về vùng 50 EMA là điều hoàn toàn có thể xảy ra. Kết Luận Cuối Cùng: Nên Hành Động Ngay Hay Chờ? Xu Hướng Hiện Tại: Mạnh mẽ tăng nhưng có khả năng quá mở rộng. RSI: Trong vùng quá mua, hãy cẩn trọng. MACD: Vẫn tích cực, nhưng cho thấy dấu hiệu ban đầu của việc chậm lại. Chiến Lược: Nếu bạn đã có lợi nhuận, đây là thời điểm tuyệt vời để cân nhắc chốt lời hoặc siết chặt stop-loss. Nếu bạn đang chờ cơ hội vào lệnh, hãy đợi một đợt điều chỉnh về vùng 50 EMA để có điểm vào với tỷ lệ rủi ro/lợi nhuận tốt hơn. Mẹo Pro Sử Dụng RSI Như Một Cao Thủ RSI rất đơn giản, nhưng cách sử dụng nó mới là chìa khóa. Dưới đây là vài bí kíp từ các trader chuyên nghiệp: ● Hiểu Bối Cảnh Thị Trường RSI hoạt động xuất sắc trong thị trường đi ngang (range-bound), nơi giá bật qua lại giữa hỗ trợ và kháng cự. Nhưng trong xu hướng mạnh (như đợt tăng giá), RSI có thể duy trì vùng quá mua/quá bán trong nhiều tuần. Vì vậy, đừng vội bán chỉ vì RSI chạm 70 – hãy nhìn bức tranh lớn hơn.. ● Kết Hợp Với Các Chỉ Báo Khác RSI hoạt động tốt nhất khi có bạn đồng hành. Hãy ghép nó với: ○ MACD để kiểm tra xem động lực có đồng thuận với RSI không. ○ Đường Trung Bình Động (như 50 EMA) để xem giá có bị kéo quá xa khỏi các mức hỗ trợ chính không. ● Quan Sát Phân Kỳ ○ Nếu giá tạo đỉnh mới, nhưng RSI không? Đó là phân kỳ giảm – động lực có thể đang suy yếu. ○ Nếu giá tạo đáy mới, nhưng RSI không? Đó là phân kỳ tăng – một đợt bật lên có thể sắp tới. ○ Phân kỳ không luôn diễn ra ngay lập tức, nhưng đây là một manh mối mà các trader nghiêm túc không bao giờ bỏ qua. ● RSI Là Chỉ Báo Sớm, Không Phải Lệnh Gọi Hành Động Chỉ vì RSI báo hiệu quá mua/quá bán không có nghĩa bạn cần hành động ngay. Hãy coi nó như cảnh báo sớm, không phải lý do để hoảng loạn mua/bán. ● Chơi Với Các Khung Thời Gian Để Tinh Chỉnh Chiến Lược Các chỉ số RSI thay đổi tùy thuộc vào khung thời gian bạn đang xem. ○ Nếu RSI hàng ngày báo hiệu quá mua, nhưng RSI 1 giờ đang hạ nhiệt, điều này thường cho thấy thị trường đang trong đợt điều chỉnh ngắn hạn bên trong xu hướng tăng lớn hơn. ○ Trader thông minh sẽ tận dụng điều này, chờ RSI ngắn hạn reset trước khi nhảy vào xu hướng lớn hơn.

BTC is now consolidating and might aim for another increase toward $110,000 Bitcoin started a fresh upward move from the $105,000 zone. The price is trading above $106,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $106,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $107,200 resistance. Bitcoin Price Moves Higher Toward New ATH Bitcoin price started a fresh increase from the $103,200 support zone. BTC formed a base and was able to clear the $105,000 resistance zone. The bulls pushed the price above $105,500. There was a break above a connecting bearish trend line with resistance at $106,400 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The bulls even pumped the price above the $107,000 resistance zone. However, the price failed to extend gains. A high was formed at $107,262 and the price is now consolidating gains near the same trend line. There was a minor decline below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $104,269 swing low to the $107,262 high. Bitcoin is now trading above $106,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $107,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $107,200 level. The next key resistance could be $107,500. A close above the $107,500 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $108,800 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $110,000 level and a new all-time high. Another Decline In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $107,000 resistance zone, it could start another correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $106,250 level. The first major support is near the $105,400 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $104,269 swing low to the $107,262 high. The next support is now near the $104,250 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $103,500 support in the near term. The main support sits at $102,500, below which BTC might gain bearish momentum. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $105,400, followed by $104,250.

What The Charts Say,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-ready-new-aths-what-the-charts-say/,"An analyst has explained what some charts related to Bitcoin could say regarding whether the current run can lead to a new high or not. Bitcoin Momentum May Be Stalling According To These Signs In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about some technical analysis (TA) signs that could reveal if it’s time for Bitcoin to reach a new all-time high (ATH). Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says Here are the charts that the analyst has shared: The first graph shows a TA pattern that Bitcoin has potentially been trading inside for the last few months. The pattern in question is a “Parallel Channel,” which emerges whenever an asset’s price observes consolidation between two parallel trendlines. There are different types of Parallel Channels, but in the context of the current topic, the most ordinary version is of interest: the one with the channel parallel to the time-axis. This case naturally corresponds to a completely sideways movement from the cryptocurrency. From the chart, it’s visible that BTC has recently observed a rise to the upper line of the pattern. During previous retests, the coin ended up finding rejection at this mark. Thus, it’s possible that it may also face resistance here during the current retest. This isn’t the only trend that could make a break to the ATH a tricky one. As is visible from the second graph, the RSI has shown divergence from the Bitcoin price recently. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) here refers to an indicator that keeps track of the speed and magnitude of changes that the asset’s price has witnessed recently. This metric is generally used for judging overpriced and underpriced conditions for the token. BTC’s RSI formed a peak in the overbought region earlier in the month, but while the price has gone up since then, the indicator has only managed to form a smaller peak. This type of divergence between the asset and the RSI is often considered to be a bearish signal. Lastly, there is also a bearish development in the MACD, displayed in the third chart. The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD) is another TA indicator that’s used for gauging momentum. It involves two lines: the MACD line calculated by taking the difference between the 12-day and 26-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) of the price and the signal line determined as the 9-day EMA of the MACD line. Recently, the MACD line for Bitcoin has dipped under the signal line, which is usually considered as a bearish crossover. Related Reading: Bitcoin At $103,000 Relatively Cool Per This Indicator, Quant Says Based on all these patterns, Martinez has noted that momentum is stalling for BTC.

While BTC commands institutional dominance, many traders believe the real upside lies in smaller-cap assets that benefit from its momentum. That’s why tokens like MAGACOIN FINANCE , XRP , and Cardano (ADA) are dominating current watchlists. With fresh inflows, expanding narratives, and key technical setups, these three may be best positioned to push toward the elusive 1,000x tier before the year ends. Ethereum (ETH) and Cosmos (ATOM) round out the group with steady performance and ecosystem strength—but the spotlight is clearly shifting toward early-stage opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE. CLICK HERE – $0.007 LISTING COMING FAST Bitcoin’s Surge: The Market Catalyst Bitcoin’s latest rally is driven by global economic uncertainty, institutional adoption, and regulatory clarity. Moody’s US credit downgrade and major banks enabling Bitcoin purchases have strengthened its narrative as a macro hedge, attracting both retail and institutional capital. Historically, when Bitcoin rallies, it often triggers a “trickle-down” effect: capital first flows into BTC, then rotates into altcoins as investors seek higher returns. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Exponential Potential or Hype? MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a standout among early-stage altcoins. With over $8 million raised and a presale price under $0.001, analysts project potential returns ranging from 35x to as high as 18,500% (185x), with some even suggesting a $1 target by year-end 2025—though this would require a meteoric rise. Its scarcity-driven tokenomics (100 billion cap, 45% in presale), audited smart contracts, and viral meme appeal are fueling rapid community growth and investor interest. Conservative analyst targets: 35x–50x returns Aggressive projections: Up to 185x, with $1 as a “stretch” target Key drivers: Early entry, scarcity, community momentum XRP Prepares for Institutional Access XRP continues to trade above $2.30 , supported by speculation around CME Futures and potential ETF developments. With global settlement infrastructure already in place, and regulatory clarity opening the doors to institutions, XRP is being revalued by investors aiming for long-term growth. Price targets as high as $10–$15 are being floated as adoption expands. Cardano Shows Quiet Strength With Rebuilding Momentum Cardano (ADA) remains one of the most resilient Layer-1s, and recent upticks in smart contract deployment and active wallet usage are catching attention. While its pace is slower than peers, ADA is regaining confidence as a stable growth play—and some are looking at it as an undervalued opportunity heading into summer. Ethereum Anchors Portfolios With ETF Optimism Ethereum (ETH) is holding near $2,700 , bolstered by anticipation of spot ETF approval and strong Layer-2 expansion. While not as high-risk as other altcoins, ETH continues to provide solid upside potential for portfolios seeking stability in a rapidly evolving market. Cosmos (ATOM) Builds Developer Engagement Cosmos (ATOM) is seeing renewed developer activity and ecosystem interest. With cross-chain infrastructure gaining traction, ATOM may be one of the more underrated projects quietly building momentum behind the scenes. 5000% ROI STILL ON THE TABLE – ACT NOW Conclusion Bitcoin’s strength is creating the conditions for the next round of high-return altcoin plays. While XRP , Cardano , and Ethereum offer layered value, it’s MAGACOIN FINANCE that currently holds the greatest potential for exponential returns . As early entry narrows and capital flows accelerate, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the most explosive opportunity of 2025.

Top Trader Locks In 600% Profit on XRP, Moves to Ethereum appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A popular crypto trader has made headlines after revealing he earned a 600% profit on his XRP investment and has now moved that money into Ethereum (ETH), hoping for better returns in the near future. The trader, known as Doctor Profit, shared this update with his followers online. He said he decided to cash out his XRP profits at the current price and put the funds into Ethereum, which he feels has a stronger chance to grow in the coming days. “I’ve just closed my XRP position after locking in a 600% profit,” he wrote. “I’ve now shifted that amount into ETH because I see a better setup there right now.” Took 600% profit from #XRP and entering big into #ETH with all the profits!

He still sees it as a good long-term option and plans to buy back in when market conditions improve. “XRP is still one of my favorite long-term projects. I’ll look to re-enter when the time is right,” he added. What Made Him Choose Ethereum? Ethereum has seen steady price growth over the past few weeks. Many market experts believe ETH could be preparing for another price jump, especially with important updates and events lined up. Doctor Profit’s move is a good example of how traders often book profits from one coin and invest those gains into another, based on current market opportunities. With Ethereum performing well compared to many other cryptocurrencies lately, it makes sense for traders to consider it for fresh entries. XRP Price Analysis XRP is maintaining a bullish market structure since its April lows, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows. The token is currently back testing a key support range, historically a bullish move in uptrend scenarios. If XRP can hold above its April low of $1.64 and break above the key resistance at $2.59, it could trigger a big rally.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 03:01:32

The trio misled investors while selling “rights certificates” linked to an unissued Unicoin token. The complaint , filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Tuesday, May 20, names chief executive and board chairman Alex Konanykhin, former president Silvina Moschini, and former chief investment officer Alex Dominguez. According to the SEC, the defendants inflated asset values and wrongly implied federal approval to boost sales. “We allege that Unicoin and its executives exploited thousands of investors with fictitious promises that its tokens, when issued, would be backed by real-world assets including an international portfolio of valuable real estate holdings,” said Mark Cave, associate director in the SEC’s Division of Enforcement. “But as we allege, the real estate assets were worth a mere fraction of what the company claimed, and the majority of the company’s sales of rights certificates were illusory,” he added. The agency says Unicoin placed ads in airports, thousands of New York City taxis, on television, and on social media, portraying the certificates as a safe “next-generation” digital investment. More than 5,000 people bought in, believing each certificate would later convert one-for-one into Unicoin tokens. Unicoin CEO sold 37.9 million of his own certificates Investigators highlight three key misstatements. First, executives said the future tokens were “asset-backed” by billions of dollars in property and stakes in pre-IPO firms, even though company assets were only a fraction of that figure. Second, they boasted of selling more than $3 billion in certificates, while actual proceeds never exceeded $110 million. Third, they described the certificates and tokens as “SEC-registered” or “U.S. registered,” though no registration had been filed. The complaint also accuses Konanykhin and the company of running unregistered offerings. Regulators say the chief executive sold more than 37.9 million of his own rights certificates, often at a discount. Unicoin, Konanykhin, Moschini, and Dominguez are charged with violating antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The SEC asked the court for “permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest, and civil penalties ” and orders barring the trio from serving as officers or directors of public companies. The action also seeks civil fines against the company itself. The suit further names general counsel Richard Devlin, alleging he repeated similar false claims in private placement memoranda. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Devlin has agreed to a settlement that imposes a permanent injunction and a $37,500 civil penalty.

MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Bitcoin May Lead the Charge First",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-xrp-going-to-10-magacoin-finance-solana-and-bitcoin-may-lead-the-charge-first/,"Introduction With XRP showing strong technical structure and fresh investor interest, the question on every trader’s mind is whether a move to $10 is truly on the table. While XRP continues to gain strength, a handful of other tokens are already accelerating ahead. Bitcoin (BTC) is holding firm, Solana (SOL) is maintaining bullish pressure—and MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning into one of the most talked-about early-stage altcoins of 2025. Alongside them, Polkadot (DOT) is starting to reenter investor conversations, rounding out a lineup of assets that could lead this cycle before XRP fully ignites. JOIN NOW — $0.007 LISTING IS COMING FAST! Why MAGACOIN FINANCE Is Emerging as a Front-Runner MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly becoming one of the most aggressively positioned altcoins on the market. Now entering the final stretch of Stage 8 , the project has raised over $8 million and is gaining attention for its unique mix of political narrative, capped supply, and high-engagement community. With a verified HashEx audit and a target listing price of $0.007 , analysts are treating it as a legitimate high-upside contender for this year’s altcoin breakout list. What separates MAGACOIN FINANCE from others in the meme and political token space is its structure. Investors from Bitcoin, Solana, and even XRP communities are now reallocating into MAGACOIN FINANCE for one reason: it still offers real asymmetric entry in a market where most plays are already priced in. XRP’s $10 Ambition: Hype or Reality? XRP is once again at the center of bullish speculation, with analysts and investors debating whether the token can reach the coveted $10 mark. As of May 2025, XRP is trading around $2.33–$2.60, buoyed by regulatory clarity after Ripple’s settlement with the SEC and renewed institutional interest. But is $10 a realistic target in the near or medium term—and what role do MAGACOIN FINANCE, Solana, and Bitcoin play in this evolving narrative? Bitcoin Anchors the Market, Fuels Altcoin Rotation Bitcoin (BTC) : Bitcoin remains the benchmark, stabilizing above $100,000 and projected to reach $200,000–$250,000 by year-end as institutional demand outpaces new supply. Its continued dominance is setting a bullish tone for the entire crypto sector. Solana Maintains Its Position as the Cycle’s Layer-1 Leader Solana (SOL) is consolidating between $158–$175, with bullish forecasts targeting $240–$280 later in 2025 as its ecosystem grows and institutional adoption rises. SOL’s consistent performance is prompting some investors to rotate profits into emerging altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE for greater upside Polkadot Reenters the Spotlight on Ecosystem Revival Polkadot (DOT) is seeing a slow but steady return to relevance, with ecosystem upgrades and parachain innovations reviving investor interest. While still early in its rebound, DOT could become a solid rotation play as attention spreads beyond the biggest names. CLICK HERE – TIME IS RUNNING OUT Conclusion XRP may be heading toward $10, but the path there may be paved by faster-moving tokens first. MAGACOIN FINANCE , Solana , and Bitcoin are leading the charge, attracting early capital and building strong positioning in Q2 2025. With MAGACOIN FINANCE nearing Stage 8 completion, this could be one of the most time-sensitive opportunities in the market today.

Analysts suggest the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap could face a short-term pullback before attempting to break through higher resistance levels. Ethereum Showing Signs Of Overheating According to a CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor ShayanMarkets, ETH is beginning to show signs of an overheated rally. The analyst shared the following chart illustrating ETH’s total trading volume across various crypto exchanges. In this chart, each bubble’s size reflects the magnitude of trading volume, while the color indicates the rate of volume change, categorized into four groups – Cooling, Neutral, Overheating, and Highly Overheating. Related Reading: Ethereum Gains Momentum Amid Flat Funding Rates – Is This A Healthy Uptrend? Ethereum’s ongoing price rally, which began in mid-April 2025, has seen a notable surge in trading activity. Within just a month, the asset’s market condition shifted from Cooling (green bubbles) to Overheating (red bubbles). The current overheated condition may lead to a short-term correction as the market cools and enters another accumulation phase. However, the depth and duration of any potential pullback remain uncertain. The CryptoQuant contributor attributes this spike in volume to profit-taking and significant resting supply at the psychologically important $2,500 resistance level. Data from CoinGecko shows ETH has jumped an impressive 59.7% over the past 30 days, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) during the same period. ShayanMarkets concludes: Consequently, Ethereum is expected to continue its consolidation phase until fresh demand emerges to drive a breakout above this resistance range in the mid-term. In a separate post on X, veteran crypto analyst Ali Martinez pointed to Ethereum’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) extreme deviation pricing bands. He emphasized that ETH must hold above $2,200 to maintain bullish momentum. Should this level hold, Martinez believes ETH could target $3,000, or potentially even $4,000, if buying pressure strengthens. Where Is ETH Headed? Analysts Weigh In Ethereum’s impressive performance of late has attracted attention from several crypto analysts, who are now speculating the digital asset’s future price trajectory. According to crypto analyst Ted Pillows, ETH’s 12-hour chart recently confirmed a Golden Cross, a bullish signal that typically precedes major price rallies. Related Reading: Ethereum Holders Stay Committed Despite Unrealized Losses – Signs Of An Incoming Rally? ​​In another analysis, Pillows forecasted that ETH could be eyeing a move to $4,000, noting that the asset has traded within a massive symmetrical triangle since Q3 2020. The $4,000 level lies just below the triangle’s upper boundary. In contrast, crypto analyst Gianni Pichichero warned of a potential retracement to $2,350, citing the emergence of lower lows on Ethereum’s daily chart as a bearish signal. At press time, ETH trades at $2,500, up 3.6% in the past 24 hours.

Welch said in a May 21 episode of her “Talk Tuah” podcast that the FBI showed up at her grandmother’s house looking to speak to her over the Hawk Tuah (HAWK) crypto token, which many crypto commentators have called an exit scam. “After the coin launch, the feds came to granny’s house and knocked on her door, and she called me, having a heart attack, saying: ‘The FBI is here after you, what have you done?’” Welch said she handed over her phone to the FBI and met with agents who “interrogated me, asking me questions and everything else related to crypto.” “They cleared me, I was good to go,” Welch said. Welch went viral for her response about an oral sex technique in a vox pop interview posted to YouTube in June. The HAWK memecoin, based on her viral catchphrase, launched in early December and almost immediately lost 90% of its value and blockchain analytics firm Bubblemaps’ alleged insider wallets and snipers bought up and dumped massive quantities of the token at launch. Haliey Welch speaking on her Talk Tuah podcast about the HAWK memecoin. Source: YouTube Welch said on her podcast that the Securities and Exchange Commission also asked for her phone, and she sent it off “for two or three days” before she was cleared. Welch’s lawyer James Sallah told TMZ in March that the SEC “closed the investigation without making any findings against, or seeking any monetary sanctions from, Haliey.” “I trusted the wrong people” Welch admitted knowing very little about crypto before the HAWK memecoin and said she “trusted the wrong people” for the launch. She claimed a company, which she said she couldn’t name for legal reasons, was in full control of her X account, which posted videos of her promoting the memecoin. Welch said she was sent lines to record on video, which were then posted on her X account by someone she trusted but could also not legally name. She added that on the day of HAWK’s launch, she “kind of knew something was up” and was pulled into a room where a team of people told her to talk on a livestream with YouTuber Stephen Findeisen, better known as Coffeezilla. “Coffeezilla got on there and they're like ‘Mute it, mute it,’” Welch said. “Nobody warned me about this guy at all, like nobody at all, they didn't tell me he was like a crypto wizard, that's exactly what he is — he ate me the fuck up.” Related: Justin Sun to attend Trump's dinner with memecoin backers Welch said she was only paid a marketing fee and “did not make a dime from the coin itself,” which she said had been totally spent on legal and public relations fees. A now-deleted post where Welch shared the HAWK token’s tokenomics before it launched. Source: X Despite being cleared of any legal wrongdoing, Welch took some accountability, admitting that she let many of her fans down who invested in the coin: “It makes me feel really bad that they trusted me, and I led them to something that I did not have enough knowledge about. I did not have enough knowledge about crypto to be getting involved with it. And I knew that, but I got talked into it, and I trusted the wrong people.” A group of HAWK buyers sued the alleged creators of the token in December, claiming Alex Schultz, the token’s backing Tuah the Moon Foundation, the token launchpad overHere Limited, and its founder Clinton So promoted and sold HAWK as an unregistered security.

While some legal experts following the case closely believe it might take a few more months before a final verdict is reached, misleading claims and rumours continue to spread on social media. Recently, a user named Altcoin Bale posted on X, claiming that the case was already closed, banks were quietly buying XRP, and retail investors would soon be priced out. But this statement didn’t sit well with pro-XRP attorney Bill Morgan, who has been actively tracking the lawsuit. Bill quickly responded, saying, “FFS the case is not closed, or did you miss the news last week about an unsuccessful motion for an indicative ruling and an Appeal and Cross-appeal in abeyance but not over.” Another user replied to Bill, saying that the case had hit a procedural snag because both Ripple and the SEC submitted a dismissal request using the wrong form. According to them, this technical error led the judge to reject it.

It’s a far bigger issue than that,” he commented. Bill Morgan, expressing his frustration, remarked, “The XRP community don’t want to listen. They want to hear ‘case closed, XRP to the moon.’” For the unversed, here’s what actually happened: Judge Analisa Torres denied both parties’ motions for an indicative ruling. In simple terms, the judge stated that if the court’s jurisdiction were restored, she would deny the motion as it was filed under the wrong procedural rule. This means Ripple and the SEC will likely have to refile the motion correctly, and possibly plead their case once again. While XRP supporters are eagerly awaiting good news, it’s clear from the legal experts’ comments that the lawsuit is still ongoing — and there are a few more legal hurdles to clear before any final outcome.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 04:04:50

The suit, brought to federal court on May 13, claims the company violated Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) by capturing users’ facial data without proper notice or consent. Consumer Fraud and Data Breach Charges According to the submission , users were asked to upload a government ID and a selfie as part of the sign-up procedure. These images were then sent to third-party facial recognition tools that analyzed facial features like geometry and faceprints. However, the suit claims this was done without the consent of users, which the violates BIPA. “At no point during the verification process are Coinbase users asked to consent to the collection of their biometric information, notified that their biometric data will be collected by an unrelated third party, nor provided with any information about the process,” the lawsuit states. The complaint also accuses Coinbase of transmitting this data to several third-party vendors, including Jumio, Onfido, Au10tix, and Solaris, without getting permission from the parties. Further, the document reveals that over 10,000 individuals filed arbitration demands, but Coinbase’s refusal to pay the required fees led to their cases being dismissed. As a result, the plaintiffs have charged the exchange with three claims of violating state biometric privacy laws and one for consumer fraud under the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. They are seeking damages of $5,000 for every reckless or intentional violation, and $1,000 for each negligent one. The group has also lodged an order to stop the alleged data practices and wants Coinbase to cover its court costs. A Privacy Time Bomb This is not Coinbase’s first involvement in such legal troubles. In May 2023, similar action was taken over the company’s handling of facial recognition during onboarding. Meanwhile, the exchange is also dealing with the fallout from a recent data breach in which customer support agents were allegedly bribed to leak sensitive customer information. That incident caused at least six separate class-action lawsuits between May 15 and May 16, with Coinbase being accused of negligence, poor cybersecurity measures, and a slow response. Nanak Nihal Khalsa co-founder of Holonym, a privacy-focused identity company, said the problem is bigger than just the platform. “The Coinbase breach proves what we’ve known all along, KYC without zero knowledge is a privacy time bomb. You can’t collect and warehouse millions of user identities without eventually becoming both a target and a liability.” Khalsa added that users should not have to give up privacy just to access crypto services. According to the specialist, the future of identity is not in storing data but in using zero-knowledge tools that let people prove who they are without giving away personal details.

However, Blackstone’s investment, reported in a May 20 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, only totaled around $1.08 million — a fraction of the asset manager’s $1.2 trillion portfolio. Blackstone reported holding 23,094 shares of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT) as of March 31. The IBIT shares were added to Blackstone’s Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), which holds $2.63 billion worth of assets, Google Finance data shows. The filing shows Blackstone also bought 4,300 shares in crypto ATM operator Bitcoin Depot Inc. (BTM) for a total cost of $6,300 and spent $181,166 scooping up 9,889 shares of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO). Despite its claim as an “alternative asset manager,” Blackstone has largely stayed away from crypto. In September 2019, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman said he liked the concept of blockchain but thought its use for money was “pretty odd.” “[I was] raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies,” he said at the time. He admitted he didn’t have much interest in crypto, citing difficulties understanding the technology. Related: Bitcoin is signaling a golden cross — What does it mean for BTC price?

Latest Delay Explained appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Once again, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has hit the pause button on an XRP ETF proposal , this time from 21Shares. While it may sound disappointing, this delay is more routine than alarming. In fact, it would be way towards the approval of the XRP ETF. Despite such a massive news of delay XRP coin saw a slight a 2% drop in price in the last 24 hours. It’s Not a No—It’s Just “Not Yet The proposal from 21Shares to launch a spot XRP ETF is now delayed. But this is not a surprise. The SEC follows a long process before making decisions, and delays like this are very common. They usually take several months—up to 240 days—to review, gather public feedback, and study market data.So far, the SEC hasn’t approved any altcoin ETF—not even for Solana. It’s still testing the waters, just like it did with Bitcoin and Ethereum before giving them the green light. XRP Isn’t Alone in the Waiting Room This delay doesn’t just affect 21Shares. Other XRP ETF proposals from Franklin Templeton and Bitwise have also been pushed back earlier this year. But here’s the good news, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs were also delayed many times before they were approved. It’s just how the process works. In fact, crypto analyst James Seyffart believes the SEC might take action by late June or sometime in the last quarter of this year. So, the wait may not be too long. Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected. A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in next few days. If we're gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets — i wouldn't expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest. More likely to be in early 4Q. — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 20, 2025 Positive Signs Are Already Here Even though there’s no ETF yet, XRP is moving forward in other ways. Regulated XRP futures have already gone live this week, showing that institutions are getting more comfortable with the token. That’s a big step toward wider acceptance. And according to Polymarket predictions, there’s an 83% chance that an XRP ETF will be approved by the end of 2024. That shows strong confidence in XRP’s future. XRP Saw temporary Dip, But Long-Term Hope After the news of the delay, XRP’s price fell by about 2%, now trading around $2.35.

The latest data from TradingView shows Tuesday's candle ended (UTC) at $106,830, the highest-ever daily closing price. The bullish move came as investors poured money into the spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) amid chaotic price action in bond markets that suggested heightened concerns about the fiscal health of major economies, including the U.S. Analysts told CoinDesk last week that the worsening fiscal debt situation could bode well for BTC and other assets such as gold. The Coinbase Bitcoin Premium Index , which measures the percentage difference between the price of Bitcoin on Coinbase Pro (USD pair) and the price on Binance (USDT trading pair), remained positive, indicating a persistent buying pressure from the U.S.-based investors. With the uptrend in progress, the next key level to watch is $110,000. Data from Deribit's BTC options market, tracked by Amberdata, shows dealers or market makers hold a large net "" negative gamma"" exposure at the $110,000 level. Dealers holding negative gamma typically trade/hedge in the direction of the market to maintain their overall market exposure delta neutral. That, in turn, amplifies bearish and bullish moves. In other words, the rally may accelerate on a potential breakout above the $110,000 mark.

With the Senate already on board, the proposal now awaits the governor’s final approval. The 8th largest economy in the world will now be allowed to buy Bitcoin. This is indeed a bullish start! BREAKING: Texas has just passed the Texas Strategic #Bitcoin Reserve and Investment Act, allowing the state to invest in $BTC . The bill now awaits Governor's approval to become law. pic.twitter.com/ybIAAjOEgE — Bitcoin.com News (@BTCTN) May 20, 2025 .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Breaking: SEC Charges America’s First Crypto Company in $100 Million Crypto Scam , Laying the Groundwork While SB 21 doesn’t specify how much Bitcoin the state will purchase, it sets up the legal foundation to begin. According to the Texas Blockchain Council, the bill is scheduled for a vote in the House and, if passed, will mark a historic move toward Bitcoin adoption at the state level. Texas is following in President Trump’s footsteps by calling for a national Bitcoin reserve . However, other states like New Hampshire and Arizona have already passed similar measures, beating Texas in the race to lead U.S. crypto integration. What’s Next? Lee Bratcher of the Texas Blockchain Council told Axios that while SB 21 sets up the reserve, separate legislation is being prepared to decide how much Bitcoin the state will actually allocate to the fund. That decision, however, remains pending. If signed into law, Texas could soon become a major player in government-backed Bitcoin investments, further cementing the state’s pro-crypto stance. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Sharing insights from several key industry figures and government sources, Crypto Sensei outlined how Australia is leveraging distributed ledger technology to modernize its financial infrastructure. COUNTRIES ARE READY FOR #XRP ADOPTION! (BREAKING XRP NEWS) pic.twitter.com/953xKBv8Lq — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) May 18, 2025 Ripple’s recent joint report with the Digital Economy Council of Australia (DECA) and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC) explores the policy framework needed to support real-world asset tokenization . Crypto Sensei noted that the report identifies a “$12 billion annual gain” in productivity for existing markets and highlights the opportunity to create liquidity in traditionally illiquid assets. These developments are expected to transform asset accessibility, including in the housing sector, by enabling fractional ownership through tokenization. He also drew attention to the comparative lag in the U.S., contrasting it with the progress. Ripple’s Expanding Network in Australia Ripple has been active in the region for years. Crypto Sensei shared a clip where Eric Van Miltenburg, Ripple’s Senior Vice President of Business, confirmed the expansion of On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) corridors into Australia and other parts of the globe. Ripple’s reach also extends into local fintech ecosystems. Hai Ha Money Transfer, an Australian remittance firm, has partnered with Ripple for three years. Its CEO, Diane Nguyen, explained how Ripple’s technology improves liquidity and speeds up international transfers.

The project also includes Fireblocks and R3. Crypto Hulk added context by referencing Dilip Rao, a key figure in the development of the XRP Ledger, who later worked with the Reserve Bank of Australia. Hulk also pointed out early signs of Ripple’s Australian engagement dating back to 2015. Government and Regulatory Support Political backing is another factor in Australia’s crypto momentum. While the U.S. regulatory landscape is improving , other countries are in a better position. Andrew Charlton, recently appointed Assistant Minister for the Digital Economy, affirmed that “cryptocurrency is no longer just an emerging technology,” and that the government aims to balance innovation with consumer protection. Monica Long, President of Ripple, also highlighted Australia’s significance as one of the company’s key corridors, alongside Singapore and Europe. She confirmed the company’s plans to meet this demand with RLUSD, its stablecoin, and Australia’s pro-crypto advancements, positioning it as a leading force in the global shift toward digital assets.

Here Are 2 Altcoins Going Viral,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/finding-the-next-crypto-to-explode-500-like-ripple-xrp-here-are-2-altcoins-going-viral/,"Ripple (XRP) has long been a crypto poster child for dramatic price surges. It is known to have exploded by over 500% in the past, fetching those who stuck with it gargantuan profits. But with its legal issue rearing its ugly head, XRP doesn’t look like replicating those meteoric rallies anytime soon. Instead, investors are looking towards Remittix (RTX) and Sui crypto tokens for such types of returns. Do these trailblazing tokens have what it takes to deliver? Let’s find out. Remittix holders prepare for a rocket price surge Remittix is a cross-border payments solution that bridges crypto and fiat seamlessly. Users send crypto, and recipients get instant bank transfers, with no blockchain complexity involved. With a flat-fee structure and support for 30+ fiat currencies, Remittix is poaching users from traditional giants like Wise and Western Union. The numbers speak volumes: over $15.2M raised in presale, more than half a billion tokens sold, and a 500% price increase since launch. These are metrics of a high-potential crypto token that is heading to the top. Crypto analysts expect Remittix to appreciate by at least 1,000% before its presale concludes, which makes its entry price of $0.0781 extremely attractive to investors. Even more, the coin’s presale is nearly concluded, which means that an exchange listing is imminent. When this happens, analysts expect the RTX price to surge to the moon. SUI crypto price booms 75% as institutional interest rises SUI is a Layer-1 blockchain platform that focuses on offering secure, scalable, and powerful decentralized applications. This means that it operates in an extremely competitive crypto niche, but that hasn’t stifled SUI. Over the last month, SUI price appreciated by 75%, hitting $4 for the first time since January. Sui derivatives volume. Source: CoinGlass In addition to that, institutional interest in SUI is rising. The coin recently saw weekly inflows to the tune of $9.3 million, eclipsing the likes of Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA). Should this continue, SUI could retest $4 and even hit a new high above $5. Can XRP price rediscover past meteoric forms? In late 2024, XRP surged by over 400% within weeks, sending shockwaves throughout the crypto world. Fast forward to May 2025, and XRP is once again in the spotlight. But this time, XRP isn’t making the news for spurious rallies; people are commenting about its never-ending SEC case and its struggles. After a US judge threw out a motion to finally resolve its case with the SEC, XRP has steadily declined. The coin has fallen from above $2.6 to around $2.3. While this drop is minimal, several signals suggest a bearish XRP run could be in the works. Source: TradingView In essence, XRP is displaying a classic head-and-shoulders pattern, which is basically a higher peak flanked by two lower peaks. It has bearish tendencies, and analysts suggest XRP could drop to $2 or lower should the status quo remain. Conclusion It would be difficult for XRP to embark on another 500% rally. Sui crypto might rally remarkably given its current momentum, but the resulting returns are likely to be minimal. Remittix, on the other hand, is set to rocket to the stars and fetch as much as a 10x profit for early investors. That’s because it packs immense potential to disrupt the global remittances market. This makes it the optimal choice for crypto investors who want to maximize their profits in 2025.

In 2024, the German government liquidated nearly 50,000 Bitcoin at an average price of $57,900, missing out on more than $2 billion in gains as BTC surged past $106,000. Meanwhile, US-based investment firm Strive is taking the opposite approach and accumulating Bitcoin by purchasing distressed Mt. Gox claims at a discount. Strive Targets Mt. Gox Claims to Expand Bitcoin Holdings Ahead of Asset Entities Merger Vivek Ramaswamy’s Bitcoin strategy is entering a bold new phase. Strive, the investment firm co-founded by the former Republican presidential candidate, has disclosed a plan to acquire distressed Bitcoin claims from the long-defunct Mt. Gox exchange, an aggressive play designed to accelerate its transformation into a full-fledged Bitcoin treasury company. In a May 20 regulatory filing , Strive revealed it has partnered with 117 Castell Advisory Group LLC to target legally validated but undelivered claims tied to over 75,000 BTC—currently worth more than $8 billion at market prices. These claims are part of the Mt. Gox bankruptcy estate, which has yet to fully repay creditors more than a decade after the infamous 2014 collapse. The move, according to Strive, is aimed at acquiring Bitcoin at a significant discount compared to current spot prices. Since Mt. Gox claimants are often willing to accept less than full value in order to gain liquidity, Strive sees the opportunity as both financially compelling and strategic. By accumulating BTC through discounted claims, Strive aims to increase its Bitcoin -per-share ratio, thereby enhancing shareholder value, especially ahead of its planned reverse merger with Asset Entities (ASST), a publicly traded social media marketing company. Unlike a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) structure, which imposes additional regulatory and operational constraints, Strive argues the reverse merger offers greater flexibility in executing Bitcoin purchases and treasury management strategies. Advantages of going public via a reverse merger (Source: Strive ) The firm said it will soon file a proxy statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) outlining the full terms of the proposed Mt. Gox transaction. Shareholder approval will be required before Strive can proceed, and time is of the essence as Mt. Gox’s trustee is expected to begin full creditor repayments by Oct. 31, 2025. If Strive successfully acquires the claims before the repayment window closes, it could secure a substantial BTC cache at steep discounts, an outcome that would immediately elevate its standing among corporate Bitcoin holders. Mt. Gox: A Brief Background Once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after a massive security breach led to the loss of approximately 750,000 BTC, worth just hundreds of millions at the time, but tens of billions today. Since then, trustees have recovered and secured more than 140,000 BTC, with various entities and individuals holding legal claims. The repayment process has been slow and complicated by legal wrangling, evolving crypto regulations, and logistical hurdles. Strive is now capitalizing on this complexity, hoping to become a middleman between Mt. Gox and the open market by acquiring the right to those BTC allocations from existing claimants. Strive’s pivot toward Bitcoin mirrors a growing trend among companies looking to embed BTC into their balance sheets as a strategic reserve asset, a movement gaining significant momentum in 2025. A key example is Twenty One Capital, the Jack Mallers-backed Bitcoin treasury startup, which is preparing to launch with 42,000 BTC and has received strategic backing from Tether, SoftBank, and Cantor Fitzgerald. The firm is also merging via a blank-check deal with Cantor Equity Partners. Asset Entities Stock Surges on Merger News The market has responded positively to Strive’s plans. Shares of Asset Entities (ASST) surged 18.2% on May 20, closing at $7.74, according to Google Finance. The surge puts its current market capitalization at $122.1 million, representing a staggering 1,170% gain since the merger was first announced on May 7. Asset Entities share price (Source: Google Finance ) Following the reverse merger, Strive is expected to control 94.2% of the combined company, with Asset Entities shareholders retaining the remaining 5.8%. The merged firm will continue trading under the ASST ticker, but will operate under the unified brand name: Strive and Asset Entities. With strong market interest, favorable legal timing, and a clear path to gaining discounted BTC exposure, Strive is positioning itself to become a major corporate holder of Bitcoin, potentially rivaling firms like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Tether in scale and ambition. For Strive, the combination of a Bitcoin accumulation strategy and a reverse public market entry could establish a new model for digital asset treasury management. The firm is betting that Bitcoin’s long-term value appreciation will outweigh the risks involved in acquiring legacy claims. Should shareholder approval be granted and the Mt. Gox repayment schedule remain on track, the next six months could be transformative—not just for Strive, but for the emerging corporate Bitcoin ecosystem as a whole. With regulatory oversight intensifying and macroeconomic volatility shaking confidence in fiat currencies, Bitcoin is becoming an increasingly attractive hedge, and Strive is among the latest to make a bold, strategic bet. German Government Missed Out on Over $2 Billion in Bitcoin Gains After 2024 Sell-Off Meanwhile, Germany’s federal authorities may have inadvertently cost taxpayers billions of dollars by selling off a massive trove of Bitcoin far too early, according to a new analysis by blockchain intelligence platform Arkham. The decision to liquidate tens of thousands of BTC in mid-2024 has now become a cautionary tale in the world of government-managed digital assets, with missed profits exceeding $2.35 billion. In a post on X, Arkham revealed that a wallet labeled “German Government (BKA)” sold 49,858 BTC, worth around $2.89 billion at the time, between June and July of 2024. The average sale price of approximately $57,900 now looks deeply discounted in hindsight, as Bitcoin currently trades above $106,000, per CoinMarketCap. “If they had held it, their BTC would now be worth $5.24 billion,” Arkham stated. Seized Bitcoin Sold in Haste The funds were originally believed to have been confiscated by German law enforcement from Movie2k, a major piracy platform that was shut down in 2013. The site’s operators reportedly laundered tens of millions of euros through digital assets, including the nearly 50,000 BTC eventually transferred into a government-controlled wallet. The first signs of an impending sell-off emerged on June 19, 2024, when the wallet made a transfer of 6,500 BTC, valued at over $425 million, triggering speculation among analysts and market watchers about a coordinated liquidation strategy. However, that speculation quickly turned into confusion and concern as on-chain activity revealed that the German government was dispersing the BTC across multiple exchanges, rather than working with over-the-counter (OTC) desks or institutional brokers. The move sparked volatility in the Bitcoin markets and drew criticism for its lack of tactical finesse. Timeline of events (Source: CoinMarketCap) While the government’s intention may have been to maximize liquidity or preempt regulatory or market risks, the aftermath of the sale paints a stark picture. Arkham estimates that the early exit cost Germany over $2.35 billion in potential profit, given Bitcoin’s explosive 80% rally since the sell-off. Bitcoin’s price dipped sharply throughout June and early July 2024, a period that coincided with the BKA wallet’s most active selling. Analysts believe it was not the sheer amount of BTC sold, but rather the public knowledge of the sale that intensified bearish sentiment across the market. Bitcoin Price Recovers After Wallet Drains Interestingly, Bitcoin staged a recovery almost immediately after the German government wallet was depleted. On July 14, 2024, BTC rose back above the psychologically important $60,000 level, marking the end of a multi-week period of price suppression and investor caution. Amid the turmoil, Tron founder Justin Sun publicly offered to purchase the government’s Bitcoin stack, valued at over $2.3 billion at the time, directly from the state, in order to “minimize market impact.” Sun’s proposal echoed a broader conversation within crypto circles about transparency, responsibility, and the systemic risk posed by large, sudden liquidations of digital assets by public institutions. Lessons for Global Regulators The German experience is now likely to serve as a reference point for other countries managing seized or tax-recovered crypto assets. Several governments, including the United States, South Korea, and the United Kingdom, have begun exploring digital asset auctions or structured sales to reduce adverse market effects. As more jurisdictions deal with seized digital assets, analysts suggest governments should collaborate more closely with crypto-native custodians, financial advisors, and institutional trading desks to optimize their strategy—and reduce public losses. The missed windfall comes at a time when Bitcoin has increasingly been embraced by institutional investors, ETFs, and corporate treasuries as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical instability. In 2025 alone, inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have surpassed $20 billion, and sovereign wealth funds are rumored to be testing crypto allocations. Germany, one of the EU’s most economically powerful nations, had the rare opportunity to become a top sovereign Bitcoin holder. Instead, its decision to sell may go down as one of the most financially shortsighted in the history of public crypto asset management.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|ARKM,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-21 05:30:00

Ethereum Realized Cap Has Climbed To $244.6 Billion Recently In a new post on X, the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has talked about how the trend in the Ethereum Realized Cap has flipped since the Pectra upgrade. The Pectra upgrade went live on May 7th and introduced a bunch of improvements to the ETH network, including staking enhancements and an increase in transaction capacity. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Ready For New ATHs? What The Charts Say As the chart shared by the analytics firm shows, the upgrade’s arrival seems to have coincided with a reversal in the Realized Cap of the cryptocurrency. The Realized Cap refers to an on-chain capitalization model that calculates the total value of Ethereum by assuming that the ‘real’ value of each token in circulation is equal to the last price at which it was transacted on the blockchain. Essentially, the Realized Cap sums up the last acquisition price for the entire ETH supply. As such, it can be looked at as a measure of the total amount of capital that the investors have put into the cryptocurrency. From the graph, it’s visible that the Realized Cap hit a peak in early February and observed a reversal to the downside. Whenever the metric’s value goes down, it’s a sign that capital is flowing out of Ethereum. These outflows from the asset kept on for around three months, alongside which the price naturally witnessed a downtrend. Since the Pectra upgrade, however, another reversal has occurred for the Realized Cap, as its value has started to go up instead. On the day of the upgrade, the indicator stood at $240.8 billion. Today, it has climbed to $244.6 billion, indicating that around $3.8 billion (equivalent to a rise of 1.6%) in capital has flown into ETH in the days between. Alongside these capital inflows, the Ethereum price has observed an explosion, as it has gone from $1,800 to the current $2,500 level. It now remains to be seen how long the Realized Cap uptrend would maintain. While the capital flow situation of the coin has found a turnaround with the Pectra upgrade, the same hasn’t been true for network activity so far, as Glassnode has pointed out in another X post. “Since the upgrade, the average new and resurrected addresses are down in comparison to YTD values (–1.8% and –8.4% respectively) – but churn is notably lower as well (–8.5%),” notes the analytics firm. Resurrected addresses refer to those addresses who have become active again after a period of inactivity, while churned ones are the opposite; they are the previously active addresses who have gone cold. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Level Could Be To Watch In The Short Term, Glassnode Says These trends would imply that the upgrade has failed to attract interest from new or returning users, but at the same time, it has increased engagement among the existing Ethereum users, hence the drop in churn. ETH Price At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading around $2,500, down over 4% in the last week.

Meanwhile, Bancor launched a separate lawsuit against Uniswap, accusing the DeFi giant of patent infringement for using its constant product AMM technology without permission. This was a system Bancor claims it pioneered in 2016. Adding to the turmoil, bankrupt crypto lender Genesis sued parent company DCG and CEO Barry Silbert for allegedly siphoning more than $1 billion through fraudulent loans and misleading transactions. The Genesis lawsuit seeks to recover more than $3.3 billion. Unicoin Hit With SEC Lawsuit The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against cryptocurrency platform Unicoin and three of its top executives, accusing them of misleading investors and raising $100 million through deceptive and unsubstantiated claims. The charges were announced on May 20 and filed in Manhattan federal court. Press release (Source: SEC ) The lawsuit names Unicoin CEO Alex Konanykhin, board member Silvina Moschini, and former investment chief Alex Dominguez as defendants. According to the SEC, the three made false and misleading statements about so-called “rights certificates” that investors purchased, believing they granted access to future Unicoin tokens and equity in the company. Unicoin executives The SEC alleges that these certificates were aggressively marketed as being backed by real-world assets, including a diversified international portfolio of valuable real estate. However, the regulator pointed out that the real estate assets were worth only a fraction of what was advertised, and most of the investment claims made to the public were either inflated or entirely fictitious. Associate Director of Enforcement Mark Cave stated that the executives exploited thousands of investors by promoting false opportunities that had little to no foundation in reality. The complaint seeks permanent injunctions against Unicoin and the people involved, along with disgorgement of what the SEC described as “ill-gotten gains.” This case is now part of the regulator’s scrutiny of crypto-related fundraising practices that skirt securities laws. Bancor Sues Uniswap for Patent Infringement Other crypto projects are also facing legal trouble. Bancor, a pioneer in decentralized finance and creator of one of the earliest automated market maker (AMM) protocols, filed a lawsuit against Uniswap, alleging patent infringement related to the core technology that powers modern decentralized exchanges. The lawsuit was announced on May 20 and was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. It accuses Uniswap Labs and the Uniswap Foundation of using Bancor’s patented invention without authorization and profiting from it. Bancor press release According to Bancor, the disputed technology revolves around the concept of a “constant product automated market maker”—which is a mathematical model that governs how assets are added to or withdrawn from liquidity pools. Bancor claims to have developed this method in 2016 and secured patents for it in early 2017. This innovation later became a foundational component of many DeFi platforms, and enabled token swaps without relying on traditional order books. Bancor alleges that Uniswap, which launched its protocol in November of 2018, utilized this same invention without permission and since became one of the most dominant players in the DeFi space as a result. Mark Richardson, project lead at Bancor, stated that the decision to take legal action stems from Uniswap’s continued use of Bancor’s technology without a license, and that such unchecked behavior could undermine future innovation in the sector. Top DEXs by 24 hour volume (Source: DefiLlama ) Despite being the originator of the AMM concept, Bancor has not matched Uniswap’s success in terms of trading activity. According to data from DeFi analytics platform DefiLlama , Uniswap ranks second among all decentralized exchanges with close to $3.7 billion in 24-hour trading volume on May 20. Bancor, by contrast, was ranked 142nd, with a comparatively modest daily volume of $378,579. Uniswap has processed an impressive $2.8 trillion in total trading volume since its inception. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages for what Bancor describes as the unlicensed use of its patented system and wants to hold the Uniswap Foundation accountable for encouraging the continued infringement. Genesis Sues DCG and Barry Silbert for Fraud To add to the legal onslaughts in the crypto industry, Genesis filed two lawsuits against its parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), and its CEO, Barry Silbert, accusing them of orchestrating a massive scheme involving fraud, reckless mismanagement, and the siphoning of more than $1 billion in value from the now-bankrupt firm. The allegations were brought forth by Genesis through its Litigation Oversight Committee (LOC), and claim that DCG and its affiliates drained funds via self-serving loans, concealed transactions, and manipulative accounting practices, ultimately misleading creditors and pushing Genesis further toward insolvency. A key component of the lawsuit was unsealed on May 19 in Delaware’s Court of Chancery. It describes how DCG allegedly treated Genesis like a corporate ATM by extracting over a million digital coins—valued at $2.1 billion—while providing a false impression of Genesis’s financial strength. The complaint also shared more details about how Silbert and other insiders, including former Genesis CEO Michael Moro, former DCG CFO Michael Kraines, DCG President Mark Murphy, and investment banking partner Ducera Partners, conducted sham transactions at the end of multiple financial quarters in 2022. These moves were allegedly designed to mislead Genesis lenders into believing DCG was injecting liquidity into the lender, while in reality, the support was largely an illusion. Among the most damaging claims is that Genesis was forced to accept illiquid shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as collateral—shares that were not only locked for six months due to SEC restrictions but were also explicitly prohibited from resale by DCG even after the lockup period ended. Genesis creditors are still owed an estimated $2.2 billion in crypto assets, including over 19,000 Bitcoin and almost 70,000 Ethereum. In a second lawsuit that was filed in US Bankruptcy Court, Genesis accused DCG and affiliates of withdrawing more than $1.2 billion in digital and fiat assets during the year leading up to Genesis’s bankruptcy filing. These withdrawals allegedly took place during periods of extreme market stress, including the collapses of Terra-Luna, Three Arrows Capital, and FTX, at a time when Genesis was already insolvent . According to internal documents, insiders managed to recover nearly all their funds, while retail and institutional investors were left to shoulder the losses. DCG dismissed the lawsuits as baseless and opportunistic, and claims that the complaints recycle outdated accusations and ignore efforts that were made to resolve matters through negotiations. Nevertheless, Genesis is now seeking to recover over $3.3 billion through these legal actions.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|REGULATION|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|UNI,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-05-21 05:31:20

In his first major congressional appearance, Atkins faced tough questions about the agency’s handling of crypto fraud cases, particularly its pause in proceedings against Justin Sun and the growing political noise around meme coins tied to Donald Trump . The hearing spotlighted concerns about regulatory inconsistency, lack of transparency, and possible political misuse. Lawmakers Raise Eyebrows Over Justin Sun and Meme Coins During the May 20 House Appropriations Committee hearing , Rep. Glenn Ivey questioned why the SEC appeared to slow-roll its fraud case against Sun, who recently disclosed he’s a top holder of a Trump-themed meme coin. This came after Tron’s $30 million token purchase from a Trump-inspired crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. While Atkins confirmed the case remains active, he avoided offering specific details, fueling speculation about external influence or internal hesitation. New Chair Signals Shift in SEC’s Crypto Strategy This sudden shift is quite fishy for senators, even though Atkins’ presence has been seen as a positive shift from Biden-Gensler’s restrictive move. In his testimony, he stressed the need for structured guidelines around issuance, custody, and trading of digital assets. His emphasis on policy-making rather than litigation hints at a softer stance going forward. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Breaking: SEC Charges America’s First Crypto Company in $100 Million Crypto Scam , Crypto Task Force and Upcoming Policy Moves The SEC’s Crypto Task Force , now led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, is expected to release its first report in the coming months.

This expansion includes new partnerships with Zand Bank and Mamo in the UAE, marking a notable milestone in Ripple’s international growth. BIG NEWS: Ripple now helps businesses in 6 countries move money across borders in minutes using $XRP ! Now in Dubai, U.S., Brazil, Mexico, Australia, and Switzerland — with Zand Bank & Mamo just added in the UAE. — Coin Bureau (@coinbureau) May 19, 2025 Ripple’s strategy to enhance cross-border payments has gained momentum in recent months, with several key developments supporting this trend. In April, Ripple integrated RLUSD, its stablecoin, into its Ripple Payments platform . This integration aims to improve the speed and efficiency of cross-border treasury operations for select customers, with plans to expand RLUSD’s use over time. One of the most impactful partnerships announced in April was the purchase of Hidden Road for $1.25 billion . This partnership positions XRP as a key player in mainstream financial transactions and enhances Ripple’s credibility among major financial institutions worldwide. It also makes Ripple the first crypto company to own and operate a global, multi-asset prime broker. More Positive News for XRP In the UAE, Ripple’s recent licensing by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) in March paved the way for its official operations in the region. Following this, Ripple signed Zand Bank and Mamo as its first licensed blockchain payment clients in the UAE. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Both institutions will utilize Ripple Payments to enable fast, cost-effective cross-border transfers leveraging blockchain technology. The DFSA license addresses inefficiencies in legacy payment systems and supports the UAE’s growing fintech ecosystem. The company continues to onboard financial institutions across continents, including major banks in Brazil, Australia, and the United States, further reinforcing XRP’s role as a bridge currency in cross-border payments. XRP’s popularity is also growing, and the eagerness of both retail and institutional investors to engage with the asset shows its broad appeal. Excitement for XRP’s Future Recent developments demonstrate the accelerating adoption of XRP for cross-border payments across multiple countries. Santander, one of Ripple’s key partners, released a video outlining the importance of digital payments and how the crypto market could grow significantly by 2030 , and XRP is perfectly positioned to dominate this growing market. The combination of stablecoin integration, strategic partnerships with global giants, and regulatory clarity in key markets such as the UAE collectively affirm that countries are increasingly ready for XRP adoption in their financial infrastructure.

According to a May 20 complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, the SEC alleges that Unicoin and its leadership, CEO Alex Konanykhin, board member Maria Silvina Moschini, and former chief investment officer Alex Dominguez, made false claims while promoting “rights certificates” tied to a future token, Unicoin. The company marketed these certificates as asset-backed instruments, supposedly tied to a multi-billion-dollar real estate and pre-IPO equity portfolio. In reality, the SEC claims, the assets backing Unicoin were worth only a fraction of what was advertised. Of the real estate deals highlighted in Unicoin’s promotional materials, spanning Argentina, Thailand, and the Caribbean, many never closed, and their combined value was estimated at no more than $300 million. The SEC also disputes Unicoin’s claims that it raised over $3 billion from investors. The agency alleges that actual sales amounted to roughly $110 million, gathered from more than 5,000 investors worldwide. Additionally, Unicoin reportedly touted its offerings as SEC-compliant or “U.S. registered,” even though the certificates were never officially registered and failed to meet exemption requirements under federal securities law . You might also like: Crypto languished in ‘SEC limbo’ for years: Paul Atkins reaffirms crypto commitments Unicoin is also accused of distributing tokens via airdrops without verifying investor accreditation, which the SEC says constitutes another violation. CEO Konanykhin allegedly sold nearly 38 million certificates to investors who had previously been excluded to preserve the company’s legal standing. Unicoin’s general counsel, Richard Devlin, was also charged for his role in the scheme but has already settled with the SEC. Without admitting wrongdoing, he agreed to pay a $37,500 fine and accepted a permanent injunction. The SEC is seeking civil penalties, disgorgement of funds, and executive bans against the remaining defendants. In response, Konanykhin has denied the charges and vowed to challenge them in court, claiming the SEC’s actions damaged the company and blocked critical fundraising opportunities. Despite a massive shift toward more crypto- friendly policies under the Trump administration, the SEC continues to pursue enforcement in cases it views as involving clear fraud.

Traders are now locked onto Congress, where budget negotiations are stalling and blue state Republicans are throwing up roadblocks. The House’s massive federal budget bill hit a hard pause Tuesday when several GOP lawmakers refused to support it without a bigger write-off for state and local taxes, known as SALT. That demand is now threatening to derail the entire timeline for passage. Even with President Donald Trump getting directly involved in the talks, the standoff continues. The Republican leadership had initially aimed to pass the bill before Memorial Day weekend, but that goal is fading fast. And even if lawmakers in both chambers somehow reach a deal, the final version is expected to add more government debt, piling onto America’s already eye-watering $36 trillion deficit. SALT fight stalls Trump’s ‘beautiful bill’ The SALT issue has become a battle line. Republicans from states with high local taxes want the bill to allow a larger deduction, or they won’t vote for it. Their threat is serious enough that it’s delayed everything. Trump has been actively pushing behind closed doors, but his efforts haven’t yet unlocked the gridlock. The delay is making investors nervous, and they’re watching every move from Washington like hawks. The bigger concern is what comes after a deal… the consequences. If this bill goes through, analysts say it’s going to flood the bond market with more Treasury debt, which will likely drive interest rates up and hurt investor demand. Solita Marcelli, Chief Investment Officer for the Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a Tuesday note that Trump’s bill “is likely to see various amendments before it is passed in the two chambers of Congress and signed into law, but it nonetheless is expected to add trillions of dollars to the country’s [$36 trillion] deficit over the next decade.” She warned that this could push the supply of Treasury debt even higher, which means more strain on the bond market. At the same time, Stephen Juneau, a US economist at Bank of America , warned of a possible “bond-buyer-strike.” In his note, also released Tuesday, Juneau wrote, “Adding more supply to the market at a time when demand is softening could result in a spike in borrowing rates, a decline in the dollar, and a drop in equities. This could overwhelm any growth effects from the bill itself.” Wall Street slides as traders brace for budget chaos And the markets are already reacting. On Tuesday night, the S&P 500 closed down, breaking a six-day winning streak. The Nasdaq dropped too, logging its first red day in three sessions. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 100 points, snapping a three-day climb. By early Wednesday, futures tied to all three major indexes were also sliding. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures both dropped 0.3%, while the Dow gave up 120 points, or 0.28%. Investors had been hopeful just a few weeks ago. After Trump unveiled steep import tariffs back on April 2, markets dipped briefly, then staged a fast rebound. That rally had lifted all three indexes above their April levels, with the S&P 500 clawing back into the green for the year. The 30-year Treasury yield is now hovering just below 5%, a level not seen in years. Rising yields mean falling bond prices, and that spells trouble for a market already unsure about what comes next. Add the Moody’s credit downgrade from last week to the mix, and the pressure is stacking up fast. Meanwhile, the budget bill , originally billed as Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill,” may still pass, but not without wrecking confidence along the way. And until Congress figures out how to deal with SALT, debt, and the deficit without wrecking demand in the bond market, Wall Street has no choice but to sit and wait—with one eye on the headlines and the other on portfolios. There’s no major economic data scheduled for Wednesday, so for now, all eyes stay glued to Congress and the growing federal deficit.

At the time of writing, PI Coin ( PI ) is trading at $0.7796, up 6% over the last 24 hours. Still, it remains down 38% over the past week and more than 70% below its all-time high of $2.99, which was recorded in February. Trading volume also has risen slightly, with over $221 million in the past day, a 0.8% increase that suggests renewed market interest. Looking at the daily chart, technical indicators show mixed signals. The relative strength index is near 51, which points to a neutral trend. Meanwhile, momentum and moving average convergence divergence indicators show the persistence of some selling pressure. Pi Network price analysis. Credit: crypto.news While the 20- and 30-day moving averages have flipped to buy, indicating that some buying strength is returning, short-term moving averages, like the 10-day EMA and SMA, are still flashing sell signals. Support seems to be forming around $0.77, but the token will need to break above $0.84 to confirm a stronger recovery. You might also like: Pi Network price crashes amid insider sales, rug pull claims Although PI is showing early signs of recovery, it still faces significant challenges that could restrict any sustained price growth. Many users have been unable to access their coins since the mainnet’s February launch because of persistent Know Your Customer delays. This has caused frustration, especially among early miners who expected to freely use or trade their tokens. Concerns have also been raised regarding the coin’s absence from prominent exchanges like Coinbase and Binance. Although PI is traded on sites such as Gate.io, Bitget, and OKX, the lack of a Tier 1 listing has kept liquidity low and held back wider adoption. Some community members believe the team’s limited transparency might be one reason for the lack of listings. There are also questions about the $100 million Pi Network Ventures fund, which was supposed to support new projects in the ecosystem, but has yet to show any progress. Despite having a large user base, possibly as many as 60 million, PI still has little practical application. Beyond speculation, there isn’t much demand for the token because there aren’t many widely used decentralized apps or decentralized finance services on the network. Events like PiFest have helped build hype, but without working products or real usage, price gains don’t tend to last. PI may target the $1 mark once more if it can maintain support above $0.77 and overcome resistance at $0.84. But if it doesn’t take off, prices might return to the $0.70 range. The price might find it difficult to increase much more unless important problems like token accessibility, exchange listings, and ecosystem growth are addressed.

The crypto exchange said fewer than 1% of its monthly transacting users were affected. Still, that small slice could mean thousands of people. According to reports, the attack could end up costing Coinbase as much as $400 million in reimbursements. But money might not be the biggest issue here. What’s more troubling is the kind of information that was leaked —home addresses and account balances. Some experts say this kind of data falling into the wrong hands could put people in real danger. Stolen Info Could Lead To Physical Violence Michael Arrington, founder of TechCrunch and Arrington Capital, didn’t hold back his concerns. In a May 20 post on X, he said this breach could lead to people “dying.” “It probably has already,” he added. His comment wasn’t just a hot take. There’s been a wave of violent attacks aimed at crypto holders. These are not random thefts—some involve kidnapping and even torture. I am a long time investor in and champion of @coinbase . Something that has to be said though – this hack – which includes home addresses and account balances – will lead to people dying. It probably has already. The human cost, denominated in misery, is much larger than the $400m… pic.twitter.com/ruSYKAGH7x — Michael Arrington (@arrington) May 19, 2025 On May 4 in Paris, the father of a French crypto entrepreneur was abducted . The attackers reportedly cut off one of his fingers and sent a video to his son, demanding 5 million euros in crypto. French police eventually rescued the victim after two days and arrested five suspects. That happened just days before Coinbase confirmed its own breach. The connection may be coincidence, but the trend is real—crypto investors are becoming targets. Hackers Paid Off Customer Service Workers What makes the Coinbase breach even more shocking is how it happened. According to reports, cybercriminals bribed contractors working in customer service outside the US. That gave them a way into internal systems without needing to hack anything directly. No passwords or private keys were stolen, and no crypto funds were taken, but criminals walked away with enough personal data to pull off serious scams. These kinds of inside jobs are hard to predict and even harder to stop. They show how weak some parts of the crypto industry still are when it comes to handling user security—especially when outsourcing is involved. Experts Call For Better Security Layers Ronghui Gu, one of the guys behind the security firm CertiK, says crypto companies really need to step up their game. He’s talking about things like limiting who can access what, using two-factor logins, and not just trusting everything by default. On top of that, he thinks companies should keep a close eye on their systems and make sure the staff—especially the ones dealing with private info—actually know how to spot trouble before it starts.

Solana (SOL), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Kaspa (KAS) have continued to show momentum, but another name is starting to rise. BlockDAG is now gaining attention with a strong mix of early access pricing, technical features, and growing support. Unlike projects that rely on hype, BlockDAG is grounded in real-world delivery and strategic development. Priced at just $0.0020 in its current presale, it offers a clear path to a confirmed launch price of $0.05, setting the stage for major returns. In this article, we look at how SOL, DOGE, and KAS are faring in today’s shifting landscape and why BlockDAG could soon be counted among the top crypto projects of 2025. 1. BlockDAG: Presale Gem That Has Raised Over $258M! BlockDAG (BDAG) has become one of the most talked-about top crypto projects this year. Its $0.0020 presale entry stands out until June 13, which is much less than the $0.0262 original price of batch 28. With a confirmed launch value set at $0.05, those buying BDAG now are set for a projected ROI of 2,400%, making it a standout in today’s crowded space. To date, more than 20.8 billion BDAG coins have been sold and $258 million raised. This shows strong market interest. What gives BlockDAG an edge is its EVM-compatible Layer 1 setup, allowing it to run Ethereum dApps without added complexity. It’s a ready-to-use network from day one. The project has passed a full CertiK audit and has begun shipping its 17,000+ mining units, showing that it’s already active and functioning. Five exchange listings are already confirmed, and 15 more are planned to be revealed during the June 13 GO LIVE event, bringing the total to 20 platforms set to support BDAG. If you are watching for top crypto projects with real traction and early pricing, BlockDAG is one to keep in view. The $0.0020 level might not last much longer as it moves toward a wider market release. 2. Solana (SOL): Staying Strong with DeFi Growth Solana continues to demonstrate resilience. Trading near $173, SOL recovered after a decline sparked by FTX’s move to release $5 billion in assets, including $236 million worth of unstaked SOL. This update led to added sell pressure but hasn’t shaken Solana’s core strengths. Solana’s DeFi total value locked (TVL) jumped from $7.5 billion to $9.6 billion in May. Such growth reinforces its standing among the top crypto projects, especially for those focused on decentralized finance and practical use cases. 3. Dogecoin (DOGE): Standing Out in a Shifting Market Space Dogecoin, priced at approximately $0.2271, is showing it has staying power beyond its meme roots. The network recorded a 528% rise in active addresses after the SEC acknowledged a spot Dogecoin ETF filing by 21Shares. Futures open interest also rose by 70%, reaching $1.65 billion. Analysts suggest DOGE may push past $0.24 and aim for $0.40 if momentum persists. While its origins remain lighthearted, growing adoption and trading activity make DOGE a notable mention among top crypto projects. 4. Kaspa (KAS): Price Patterns Drive Positive Momentum Kaspa (KAS) gained 30% in the past week, currently trading at about $0.1189. A bullish engulfing pattern on the weekly chart and solid support at the $0.101 Fibonacci level are helping to boost confidence. Short-term expectations now target $0.1554. With strong community support, scalable architecture, and an engaged development team, Kaspa is earning its place among the top crypto projects gaining attention. Future Outlook: Emerging Strength Across the Board Solana’s DeFi expansion signals solid growth, Dogecoin is gaining traction through ETF developments, and Kaspa is showing strength with technical gains. Each has qualities that justify its place among top crypto projects today. BlockDAG, however, is the outlier rising fast. At $0.0020 and set for a $0.05 launch, it features EVM compatibility, a completed CertiK audit, and 20 exchange listings on the way. With over 20.8 billion coins already sold and 17,000 miners running, its foundation is already active. For those watching early-stage projects with solid structure and future promise, BlockDAG could be one of the top crypto projects to watch in 2025. It is gaining ground before broader market recognition arrives.

Institutional inflows remain steady, and long-term projections toward $250,000 are now more widely accepted than ever. But while Bitcoin continues to dominate headlines, savvy investors are noticing a much faster-moving trend under the surface—one that’s shifting momentum toward smaller, faster, and more narrative-driven altcoins. That’s where MAGACOIN FINANCE comes in. Quietly but rapidly, it has begun outpacing some of the biggest names in the space—including Solana , XRP , and HBAR —by wide margins. This isn’t just early hype. It’s a signal. CLICK HERE – ONLY 0.007 AWAY FROM LIFTOFF Why Everyone’s Talking About MAGACOIN FINANCE Right Now The speed at which MAGACOIN FINANCE is climbing the radar has taken many by surprise. Originally launched as a politically inspired altcoin, it’s since gained serious market traction thanks to strong fundamentals, bold branding, and capped supply mechanics that reward early positioning. What’s making traders pay close attention is the clear divergence in performance. While larger caps are still consolidating, MAGACOIN FINANCE has shown consistent growth in both volume and community strength. Early metrics suggest it’s outperforming some competitors by as much as 10 to 1 —and that gap could widen once listings begin. A transparent roadmap, and rising organic attention, this project is no longer flying under the radar. Many believe it may become one of 2025’s defining early-stage altcoin stories. Solana Holds Support, But Lacks Immediate Breakout Solana (SOL) remains one of the most technically robust Layer-1s, but recent weeks have seen it trade in a tight range. Developers continue to build, but traders seeking rapid upside are beginning to rotate into faster-moving opportunities like MAGACOIN FINANCE while SOL consolidates. XRP Eyes Expansion but Faces Resistance XRP is stable above $2.30 and remains in accumulation mode ahead of the CME Futures launch. While long-term fundamentals are strong, short-term growth has slowed, giving investors time to seek higher-velocity opportunities elsewhere. HBAR Builds Slowly on Utility Strength HBAR continues to add enterprise-grade partnerships and long-term value through real-world integrations. However, its price performance has yet to reflect these developments, leading more aggressive investors to allocate toward higher-momentum plays. CLICK HERE – FINAL CHANCE BEFORE PRICE JUMPS 35x Conclusion Bitcoin’s rally is undeniable—but for those seeking real movement, MAGACOIN FINANCE is stealing the spotlight. With stronger growth than Solana , XRP , and HBAR combined, it’s emerging as one of the most compelling early-stage opportunities of 2025. For traders focused on speed, scarcity, and outsized return potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE could be the move others are too late to catch.

Speaking before the House Budget Committee, Atkins was questioned about memecoin projects linked to President Donald Trump and his possible ties to cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun. Democratic Representative Glenn Ivey drew attention to some events that took place before Trump’s inauguration in January. Ivey brought up the $30 million token purchase by Tron, a company owned by Justin Sun, from decentralized finance firm World Liberty Financial, which said it was inspired by Trump. The SEC later suspended the fraud case against Justin Sun and his companies. This development led to various speculations in the public. On the other hand, a memecoin connected to Trump is currently trading on the market and Trump is preparing to hold a special gala for the first 220 memecoin investors this week. “This situation doesn’t smell good to me, frankly. I hope the SEC looks into this connection,” Ivey said. Atkins, on the other hand, stated that the case against Sun is still “active” and reminded that the SEC does not classify memecoins as securities. Related News: Analyst Warns: “Bitcoin's Record High Has No Meaning, Focus on This Level Instead” Atkins, who was appointed by Trump, said that the institution had entered a “new era” after his predecessor Gary Gensler took a “hostile” stance against the crypto industry. During Gensler’s term, the SEC filed numerous lawsuits against the industry, but some of them were later dropped. In his written statement, Atkins described his plan for crypto regulation as “rulemaking through a notice and comment process.” “My primary goal during my presidency will be to develop a sound regulatory framework for crypto asset markets that operates with clear rules,” he said. “This framework will continue to deter malicious actors who engage in illegal activities while regulating issuance, custody and trading processes.” Republican Representative Chuck Edwards asked whether the SEC’s newly established crypto task force needed additional funding. The task force, established earlier this year by former interim chairman Mark Uyeda and led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, aims to clarify how securities laws apply to crypto by holding roundtables with industry representatives. “I don’t have a definitive opinion,” Atkins said. “The task force is comprised of existing staff and led by Commissioner Peirce, so there is no additional budget request,” he added. *This is not investment advice.

According to a May 21 analysis by CryptoQuant contributor ShayanMarkets, trading volume has spiked as Ethereum ( ETH ) nears this resistance zone. This increase in activity has coincided with a spike in short-term profit-taking. When a market is said to be “overheating,” it typically means that prices have risen too quickly due to speculation rather than long-term conviction. In this instance, ETH’s quick 55% recovery over the last month after a 45% decline in Q1 raises the possibility that the rally may be about to pause or reverse. The overheated market suggests a potential short-term pullback, creating room for fresh accumulation once conditions stabilize. Technical data supports this view. The relative strength index, at 69, is hovering just below the overbought zone, a level that often precedes short-term corrections. Meanwhile, momentum is still positive and all of the major moving averages, from the 10-day to the 200-day, are pointing upward. This suggests that there is still strong underlying support even when the current price action has stalled. Ethereum price analysis. Credit: crypto.news If Ethereum is unable to break $2,700, it may retreat to the $2,300–$2,350 range, where support is starting to form. If there is a more significant correction, prices may approach $2,100. However, the rally may continue if ETH makes a strong breakout above $2,700 on high volume, particularly if there are positive developments to back up the breakout.

Behind the scenes, large players appear to be positioning for what could come next. On-chain data shows that since late April, large holders, wallets with more than 10,000 ETH, have accumulated more than 450,000 ETH. Meanwhile, U.S.-based Ethereum exchange-traded funds have seen $108 million in net inflows over the past month, according to SoSoValue data . Now, a significant catalyst is approaching. By June 1st, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to make a decision regarding the inclusion of staking in ETH ETFs. By allowing institutions to earn yield from these regulated products, it could stir a new wave of demand. Along with the demand for ETFs, London-based asset manager Abraxas Capital purchased 350,703 ETH, worth about $837 million, between May 7 and May 20. With favorable on-chain trends and increasing institutional appetite, Ethereum’s long-term narrative seems intact despite short-term pressures.

The altcoin dropped to $2,400 before staging another recovery and returning to $2,600. New data now point to the possibility of a short-term pullback before a potential breakout materializes. Cooling Period Before Breakout Ethereum’s market is showing signs of overheating as it nears the $2.5K resistance level. There has been a surge in trading volume, which indicates intensified activity. In fact, according to CryptoQuant’s latest report , the sharp uptick is attributed to profit-taking and the presence of resting supply at this key psychological level. As Ethereum enters an overheated state, analysts anticipate a short-term correction that could allow the market to cool before potential upside resumes. “Consequently, Ethereum is expected to continue its consolidation phase until fresh demand emerges to drive a breakout above this resistance range in the mid-term.” While short-term market signals suggest a cooling phase, long-term holders continue to accumulate the altcoin. Long-Term Conviction Ethereum’s presence on centralized exchanges has fallen to its lowest point in over a decade, driven by growing accumulation from institutional investors and large holders. As of May 19, Santiment reported that only 4.9% of the total ETH supply is held on trading venues, which represents a historic low. Over the past five years, 15.3 million ETH have been pulled from these platforms. Meanwhile, CryptoRank.io revealed that more than 1 million ETH exited exchanges in the last month alone. This trend suggests that users are leaning toward holding ETH long-term rather than trading it. On-chain data confirms this behavior as it shows whales – wallets with over 10,000 ETH – have accumulated 450,000 coins since late April. By May 10, they collectively held 40.75 million ETH, the highest level since March. Ethereum-linked investment products also saw a much-needed respite over the past week, recording inflows of $205 million during the period, amidst a renewed investor confidence following the Pectra upgrade. This brought its year-to-date total to $575 million.

Designed to use the BEP-20 protocol on Binance Smart Chain, $KOPS provides high-speed, cost-effective transactions, support for Ethereum interoperability, and access to a versatile ecosystem that spans two chains. $KOPS is aiming for a decentralized framework with more than 8,000 members in its private Telegram group and a target to reach 10,000+. As the TRUMP Coin remains a catalyst for change in the crypto and financial fields, the KOPS project is strategically preparing for an ICO. With attention growing in the crypto community, the team plans to enter the blockchain market, promoting decentralization, utility, and active investor participation. Gaining early attention in cryptocurrency communities, the project intends to launch in the blockchain space with an emphasis on decentralization, utility, and investor participation. $KOPS Emerges from a Tale of Rebellion and Identity Interest in $KOPS is increasing owing not only to its market position but also to its narrative grounded in resistance and survival. The project is inspired by a fictional tale where a young pig, shamed and ridiculed after his father’s failed rebellion, disappears into exile. Left only with his father’s sunglasses—an inherited symbol of quiet defiance- he returns years later, no longer the subject of jokes but a masked fighter in the king’s arena. After defeating the tyrant’s strongest warriors, he removed his mask and revealed his identity. The pig that was once mocked now stood proud, crowned the King of Pigs. He led the suppressed people together and established a place where laughter did not depend on making fun of others. To gently symbolize the leadership he now held, he continued to keep his father’s sunglasses. The Technology Powering $KOPS and Its Advantages When the TRUMP was launched during January, we all know that it is a politically influential token. But the case of KOPS is different. The KOPS team has a real purpose to achieve and has built it on the most robust Binance Smart Chain. This way it ensures decentralization, community benefits like zero-trading fee, and maximum security. How KOPS Is Building a Community-Led Future in Crypto The development of the token’s community is accompanied by a robust commitment to collaborative governance, introducing a fresh model in blockchain administration. Currently, KOPS has more than 8,000 users in a private Telegram group, where they work together and talk about the future of the token. This close community anticipates growing, with a shared goal of uniting 10,000 people to advance innovation in the world of cryptocurrencies. As the pool of $KOPS holders enlarges, the group’s potential impact becomes more significant. The token is founded on principles of collective decision-making, so holders of $KOPS can influence the token’s future. This is not just about financial value, but about reshaping the way crypto communities operate in the future. The Premium Update The KOPS team is entering the market with a bang, and it’s time for you to grab the golden opportunity. The ICO event is going to happen, and it’s time for investors and traders to keep their wallets funded. To know more about the Pigdom, follow on.

Bitcoin Pepe is turning heads as the first meme ICO on Bitcoin, raking in $1 million in 24 hours ahead of a May 31 listing set to shake up crypto’s most serious chain. There’s something brewing on Bitcoin that has the crypto crowd leaning in. Bitcoin Pepe has hauled in $1 million in just 24 hours, with its presale exploding ahead of a high-stakes May 31 listing. Bitcoin is holding strong above $100k in Q2 2025, pushing its market cap past $2.1 trillion, now surpassing giants like Google. Amid that macro strength, Bitcoin Pepe is exploding in popularity as it is doing the unthinkable: making Bitcoin fun again. It’s the world’s first meme ICO on the Bitcoin network, and it’s gone full viral. It’s a bold attempt to breathe new life into the BTC chain with utility, virality, and a serious nod to earning potential.

This is the first-ever meme ICO on Bitcoin, but the bigger story is what comes next: a foundation for a fully expressive, fast-moving crypto economy on the world’s most secure chain. At the heart of this push is PEP-20, a new token standard that lets anyone issue assets directly on Bitcoin, and that could be anything from NFTs to memecoins to other DeFi activities. It’s the same unlock ERC-20 gave Ethereum, and it could set off a similar explosion of user-generated assets, memes, and communities rooted in Bitcoin’s native layer. The Bitcoin memecoin supercycle is officially on. BPEP forecast: The real degen trade after BTC’s ATH? Bitcoin Pepe has eyes on a monster debut, and the charts could light up once it lists. Early chatter suggests that listings may occur on major platforms, including Bybit, OKX, and possibly others. That means access, exposure, and serious trading volume. As that May 31 launch creeps closer, don’t be surprised if BPEP starts pulling liquidity and attention away from the usual suspects. Bitcoin’s setting the tone, but this is the afterparty people actually want to be at. The fusion of BTC’s trust with Solana-style speed is the formula for retail frenzy, especially now that BTC itself is climbing and the broader market’s turning risk-on. Memecoin mania is already rebooting. Projects like Moo Deng and Goatseus Maximus are making a triple-digit comeback, showing just how fast this sector can flip bullish. Solana gave us a 1,000x run. Bitcoin Pepe might just outdo that because BPEP has something SOL never did: Bitcoin’s name, its trust, and its untapped potential. The slam’s coming Bitcoin has grown up, institutions treat it like digital gold, and it’s the reserve asset of the internet, but Bitcoin Pepe is what could pull retail back into the game. Bitcoin Pepe is the first meme ICO on Bitcoin. This alone puts it in the history books, but what happens next could write an entirely new chapter for meme culture on crypto’s most boomer chain. With Tier-1 listings locked in and over $10.5m raised, Bitcoin Pepe’s got the ball and is sprinting toward the rim. Just as Bitcoin makes headlines with trillion-dollar comparisons, Bitcoin Pepe positions itself as the next leg of the trade, the slam after BTC’s alley-oop. Listings drop May 31. That’s less than 11 on the countdown.

The SEC said on May 20 that it needed to extend its decision on Bitwise’s application by 45 days to “consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” The agency needed to either decide or punt its decision by May 22. The agency also delayed deciding on Grayscale’s XRP ( XRP ) tracking ETF and Bitwise’s Solana ( SOL ) tracking fund while it seeks public comments and begins “proceedings to allow for additional analysis” of the proposals to ensure they meet regulatory standards. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said on X that both delays were expected as the SEC “typically takes the full time to respond to a 19b-4 filing.” “Almost all of these filings have final due dates in October,” and an early decision would be “out of the norm,” Seyffart added. “No matter how Crypto-friendly this SEC is. There’s no conspiracy here,” he said. Source: James Seyffart Seyffart said delays on other spot crypto ETF bids are also expected, and the SEC is likely to delay deciding on Litecoin ( LTC ) ETFs too. However, he added , ""Litecoin is one that has a higher likelihood vs others of getting approved first.” “A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in [the] next few days. If we’re gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets, I wouldn’t expect to see them until late June or early July at the absolute earliest. More likely to be in early 4Q,” Seyffart added. SEC dealing with flood of ETF filings Several other crypto ETF applications are approaching SEC deadlines in June. The SEC is supposed to decide on Grayscale’s Polkadot ( DOT ) tracking ETF by June 11 and 21Shares’ Polkadot ETF on June 24, according to an SEC filing.

With Genlser’s departure, the SEC is perceived as far more crypto-friendly, with several firms facing legal action from the regulator having had their cases dismissed, including crypto exchange Gemini on Feb. 26 and crypto trading firm Cumberland DRW on March 4 .

The flagship crypto has broken out of a two-week consolidation between $102,000 and $105,000 to reach fresh highs. Over the past six weeks, Bitcoin has rallied roughly 40%, and held above $100,000 for more than 11 days. Moreover, only four trading sessions in history have recorded a daily close above the current level, and last week’s close at $106,500 marked a new record. Source: Coingecko Moody’s Debt Downgrade Sparks Flight to Crypto Bitcoin’s surge has been propelled by a confluence of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Moody’s downgrade of US debt rattled confidence in traditional financial systems, while cooling trade war tensions between the US and China fostered risk-on sentiment. Meanwhile, persistent inflation has eroded fiat purchasing power, and the Federal Reserve’s cautious pace of rate cuts kept real yields elevated, dynamics that have boosted demand for Bitcoin as a hedge. Analysts Eye ETF Flows as Momentum Driver Spot Bitcoin ETFs have drawn substantial capital amid this backdrop. On May 20, they recorded a net inflow of $329m , marking a fifth straight day of positive flows. Spot Ethereum ETFs also saw $64.9m in net inflows for a third consecutive day.

He added “this fresh regulatory openness, combined with rising institutional participation, continues to position crypto for long-term growth despite short-term range-bound price action.” Ruslan Lienkha, head of markets at YouHodler, noted a clear accumulation trend. He said: “While the risk of a downside correction cannot be ruled out, particularly if negative sentiment returns to the equity markets, the likelihood of such a scenario remains relatively low in the short to medium term.” CryptoQuant analyst Axel Adler said that if the 30-day moving average of the ratio between holders’ profits and losses on coins that have moved climbs above 200, it signals an overheated market. He noted the current reading is 99, so there’s no sign of excessive euphoria yet. With Bitcoin now flirting with its previous peak, market watchers say the next few trading days will be critical. If bulls sustain above $107,000 and clear $108,786, a test of fresh highs appears increasingly likely.

The passage, which appears on page 1606 of Volume 66 of the journal, suggests that purchasers of XRP may have, in effect, acquired a portion of Ripple’s anticipated future cash flows generated through licensing its transaction settlement technology. SMQKE’s post emphasized the significance of the excerpt, quoting directly: “At the end of the day, XRP purchasers have bought, effectively, a slice of the future cashflows that Ripple would make from the licensing of its transaction settlement system.” The statement is part of a broader discussion about the relationship between Ripple’s business model and the distribution of XRP tokens. XRP HOLDERS OWN A SLICE OF RIPPLE’S FUTURE CASHFLOWS Read closely. “At the end of the day, XRP purchasers have bought, effectively, a SLICE OF THE FUTURE CASHFLOWS that Ripple would make from the licensing of its transaction settlement system.” Of course it’s… pic.twitter.com/kADEC1GbRT — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 19, 2025 Passage Raises Questions About Security Classification According to the excerpt, Ripple funds its activities through XRP distributions in exchange for investment capital and labor. The line suggesting XRP purchasers effectively acquire future cash flows implies a structure similar to that of a security. The passage compares tracking stocks and asset securitizations, stating that such instruments serve effectively the same economic function. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 However, the same excerpt also acknowledges the complexity of categorizing XRP. It notes that Ripple has structured its business in a way that gives it room to argue against the classification of XRP as a security. Specifically, the text mentions that Ripple can claim there are no direct contractual rights between the company and XRP holders and that XRP is used as more than a speculative asset. Community Reactions Address Legal and Temporal Context SMQKE’s tweet has been met with skepticism and analysis by other users. One user, Aurelia Isley, remarked , “That would make XRP a security so I doubt this is real we just dealt with a four-year lawsuit about this topic.” Another user, KYCAT, responded , “That’s interesting, however, XRP has already been classified as not a security. What is the date of the article? I suspect it’s pre-court ruling.” The court ruling likely pertains to the 2023 decision in the SEC v. Ripple Labs case, in which the Judge determined that XRP was not a security. However, some institutional sales were found to be investment contracts. This outcome led to partial regulatory clarity around XRP, implicating how crypto assets are categorized under U.S. securities laws. The excerpt highlighted by SMQKE is evidence of documented legal commentary suggesting a deeper economic linkage between XRP ownership and Ripple’s licensing revenue. The implications of such a view could reignite debates over the nature of crypto assets and their classification under securities law, particularly in light of recent and ongoing litigation in the digital asset space.

Speaking at the New York City Crypto Summit on May 20, Adams said it has the potential to attract investment, create jobs, and cement New York’s position as a global centre for blockchain innovation. “We want to use the technology of tomorrow to better serve New Yorkers today,” Adams said during his speech, adding that the council would help position New York as the “crypto capital of the globe.” The advisory body will be composed of industry experts tasked with identifying use cases that serve the public interest. While full details of the council are still pending, Adams confirmed that a chairperson would be appointed and that key policy recommendations are expected in the coming weeks. Adams revealed that New York City is exploring blockchain use in administrative functions, including managing sensitive records like birth and death certificates. “Bringing blockchain security capabilities to the city means that birth certificates and death records can remain private but accessible,” he noted.

Gox at Discount appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Strive, founded by Vivek Ramaswamy, is looking to scoop up 75,000 Bitcoin tied to Mt. Gox, the bankrupt exchange that famously collapsed in 2014. These Bitcoins are part of claims that have already received legal clearance but haven’t yet been distributed. By acquiring them, Strive hopes to buy Bitcoin at a discount and boost its crypto holdings fast. The Plan Behind the Purchase In a May 20 filing , Strive revealed its partnership with 117 Castell Advisory Group to pursue the claims. The company says this move will help it grow its Bitcoin-per-share ratio ahead of its reverse merger with Asset Entities, a deal expected to wrap up by mid-2025. Interestingly, Strive hasn’t disclosed any Bitcoin holdings yet but claims it has more flexibility than typical public companies when it comes to buying BTC. What’s Next? Shareholder Green Light Before making a move, Strive will need shareholder approval. The firm is preparing a filing for the SEC and will send out a proxy statement to outline the deal and get the go-ahead. In the meantime, Mt. Gox is expected to repay its creditors by October 31, meaning Strive has to act fast. Mt. Gox was once the biggest Bitcoin exchange before a 2014 hack wiped out 750,000 BTC. Creditors have waited over a decade for repayment, and now companies like Strive are stepping in to grab discounted claims. A Trend Among Bitcoin Treasury Firms Strive isn’t alone. New firms like Twenty One Capital, backed by Tether and SoftBank, are also diving into the Bitcoin treasury game, planning to launch with tens of thousands of BTC. Moreover, Strive’s merger partner , Asset Entities (ASST), has seen its stock skyrocket, jumping 18.2% on May 20 and up 1,170% since the merger news broke. Once the deal closes, Strive will control 94.2% of the merged company, which will continue trading under the ASST ticker. Strive Joins the Bitcoin Rush Overall, the move shows that Strive’s motive to buy more Bitcoin follows the lead of big players like Michael Saylor’s Strategy and Japan’s Metaplanet. Just this week, Strategy grabbed 7,390 BTC worth nearly $765 million, bringing its stash to over 576,000 BTC. Metaplanet also added 1,004 BTC, now holding 7,800 in total.

Currently the bulls hold strong as the XMR price maintains its ascending channel pattern. According to our analysis, we expect the XMR price to continue holding above the $360 mark after brief consolidation below the $340 mark. However, the bulls need to guard the $330 and $325 key support levels to prevent a fallback below the $320 price mark. Is Monero a good investment? Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality. Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice . Why is XMR up today? Monero price gained increased buying demand below the $340 dip. This resulted in a strong push toward $360 level, strengthening the buying domination. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption. How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chance of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinges on various factors, which will influence its future price movements . The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility are challenges. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, regulatory scrutiny and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals impact the current monero sentiment, making it challenging to become the star of the market. Monero’s commitment to privacy gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Monero historic price sentiment Monero’s market value has changed dramatically since its launch in 2014, from less than $1 to over $475. May 2021 marked the highest point in Monero’s history. Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero. Monero price history; Source: Coinmarketcap Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued late into the month before spiking past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XMR|FORKS,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-21 07:15:00

Through a series of annotated charts, Egrag outlines the historical significance of the 21-week Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and the 33-week Simple Moving Average (SMA) as primary indicators for identifying both bull market tops and the beginning of major declines. #XRP – The Secrets Are Revealed ($5.7, $9.5, $27 & $37): It all comes down to the relationship between the 21 EMA and the 33 SMA. When I’ll Sell a Big Portion of #XRP : If the 21 EMA experiences a bearish cross with the 33 SMA on the weekly chart, that’s my signal: the… pic.twitter.com/lUT0Gr42nC — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) May 19, 2025 Bearish Crosses: Historical Signals of Market Downturns Egrag’s analysis focuses on relative positions and crossovers of these moving averages. According to his post, whenever the 21 EMA crosses below the 33 SMA on the weekly chart—a formation he refers to as a “bearish cross”—it has historically coincided with the start of prolonged downtrends in XRP’s market cycle. He identifies two key instances in the past where this occurred: first in May 2018 and again in November 2021. In both cases, XRP suffered significant losses following the cross, with approximately 87% and 72% declines, respectively. Egrag calculates the average of those two drawdowns to forecast what a future bearish cross might imply. Applying the average decline of 79.5%, he estimates the potential downside if such a signal emerges again. He warns that despite possible short-term optimism from market participants, the bearish cross should be taken seriously as a major trend reversal. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Bullish Crosses: Launchpads for Significant Price Surges Conversely, Egrag emphasizes the positive implications of the opposite signal—a bullish cross—when the 21 EMA moves above the 33 SMA. His historical review identifies four major instances where such bullish crosses preceded significant price surges. In each of those events, XRP underwent substantial upward movement, including a 1600% surge, which he uses as a reference for his current outlook. Based on the present chart structure and the recent performance of XRP around the EMA/SMA levels, Egrag speculates that a similar rally could be on the horizon. He projects a potential rise toward $27, citing the 1600% historical move as precedent. His charts illustrate extended targets, including speculative price levels as high as $37, representing a 6500% increase from current levels. Mid-tier projections include $5.712 and $9.575, aligning with past market reactions and Fibonacci-based resistance zones. Critical Support and Timeline Marker Identified The analysis also includes a clearly defined threshold at $1.6394, shown in red across all visuals, potentially acting as a support level or invalidation point depending on price action in the coming weeks. The timing of this analysis is further underscored by a vertical marker on the chart pointing to September 29, 2025, which appears to be highlighted as a pivotal future date. However, no explicit rationale is given in the tweet for its significance. In conclusion, Egrag Crypto acknowledges that markets are unpredictable but maintains that these technical signals remain highly relevant. His message to XRP holders is one of vigilance, encouraging them to stay alert to moving average dynamics rather than sentiment-driven speculation.

The company’s stock has surged over 4,800% over the past year because of the company’s pivot to Bitcoin investment strategy. Originally a budget hotel operator, Metaplanet turned to Bitcoin-first treasury strategy in 2024 and has since seen a significant rise in its stock prices. As of today, the company holds 7,800 BTC, worth over $800 million after its latest purchase of 1004 BTC two days ago . Apparently Metaplanet is the most shorted stock in Japan. Do they really think betting against Bitcoin is a winning strategy? pic.twitter.com/SAKsOMO4MX — Simon Gerovich (@gerovich) May 21, 2025 A Setup for Global Short Squeeze? Despite a meteoric rise in Metaplanet’s stock, many investors have questioned the sustainability of Metaplanet’s valuation, leading to a sharp increase in short interest by hedge fund managers in the Japanese market. Short sellers, betting the stock will fall, are now under pressure as the company’s shares hit upper daily price limits and trading halts were triggered on the Tokyo Stock Exchange for two consecutive days. With the TSE temporarily restricting access, short sellers have turned to OTC trading in international markets to cover their positions. However, these exchanges offer significantly lower liquidity, forcing traders to compete for a limited supply of shares, often at prices above their original short-sale levels. This dynamic has led to mounting speculation of a global short squeeze in the making, sentiments echoed by Bitcoin bull and Tesmanian founder Vincent Yu in a post on X . He added: “This could be a really huge Metaplanet short squeeze. Short sellers are now needed to buy back in the lowest liquidity market $MTPLF & DN3 which will push up the price higher and faster, that cause more halted in Japan.” “Really Bad Timing to be Short”: Blockstream CEO Hashcash inventor Blockstream CEO Adam Back also posted on X replying to Metaplanet’s CEO saying that in his opinion the stock is still relatively cheap based on historic mNAV ranges, and on months to cover metric. “Shorting it seems like a really bad idea to me! This is the second 3350:TYO circuit-breaker limit-up day in a row, really bad timing to be short.” In related news, Bitcoin soared past $107,700 earlier this morning during Asia trading hours, just 1% shy from its all-time high of $108,786.

The asset manager has added Bitcoin ETFs and crypto ATM shares. BlackRock’s IBIT leads U.S. Bitcoin ETFs in inflows. Blackstone, the world’s largest alternative asset manager, has made its first move into crypto markets, purchasing shares in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. According to a May 20 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Blackstone acquired 23,094 IBIT shares as of March 31, valued at approximately $1.08 million. The investment was added to the firm’s $2.63 billion Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), marking the asset manager’s initial exposure to Bitcoin via regulated financial products. Blackstone Adds ProShares Bitcoin ETF and Crypto ATM Shares to Portfolio The filing also reveals that Blackstone purchased 9,889 shares of the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO), totaling $181,166, and a smaller position in Bitcoin Depot Inc. (BTM), a crypto ATM operator, with 4,300 shares worth just $6,300. Though modest in size—especially relative to Blackstone’s $1.2 trillion in assets under management—the move represents a notable shift for a firm that has historically kept crypto at arm’s length. In 2019, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman expressed skepticism about crypto, stating, “I was raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies,” and admitted difficulty understanding the technology behind it. Blackstone’s entry into Bitcoin ETFs comes as demand for institutional access to digital assets grows. $1 TRILLION BLACKSTONE JUST REVEALED BUYING #BITCOIN ETF FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THIS IS WILD!!! pic.twitter.com/PvlIddtndp — Vivek (@Vivek4real_) May 20, 2025 IBIT, launched by BlackRock in January 2024, has quickly become the leader among U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs. As of mid-May, the fund has recorded over $46.1 billion in net inflows and has not seen a single outflow since April 9, according to Farside Investors. In contrast, the Wisconsin Investment Board, one of the first U.S. public pension funds to gain Bitcoin exposure, reported on May 15 that it had fully liquidated its 6 million IBIT shares during Q1. IBIT continues to outpace competitors like Fidelity’s FBTC and ARK’s Bitcoin ETF, which have seen $11.8 billion and $2.8 billion in net inflows, respectively. DigiAsia Stock Doubles on $100M Bitcoin Purchase Plan Shares of Indonesian fintech firm DigiAsia Corp surged by over 91% on May 19 , after the Nasdaq-listed company announced plans to raise $100 million to initiate Bitcoin purchases as part of a new treasury strategy. The Jakarta-based firm revealed that its board has approved the creation of a Bitcoin treasury reserve. DigiAsia says it intends to allocate up to 50% of its net profits toward acquiring Bitcoin, signaling a shift in how it plans to manage its capital amid growing corporate interest in digital assets. In addition to deploying profits into Bitcoin, DigiAsia is actively exploring a capital raise of up to $100 million to kickstart its holdings. Notably, public companies continue to increase their exposure to Bitcoin, with Michael Saylor’s firm, Strategy, leading the charge. The Virginia-based company recently announced it would double its capital-raising efforts to $84 billion in order to acquire more Bitcoin.

But there’s one thing that 94% of traders chasing the best crypto to buy now overlook. This hidden driver fuels adoption, builds loyalty, and powers long-term success. Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) , an AI-powered meme coin on Ethereum, showcases how this metric can elevate a cryptocurrency to top status and possibly lead the next bull run. The Power of Community in Cryptocurrency Success Cryptocurrencies with active communities—marked by robust social media interactions, meme contests, and user participation—achieve higher market cap growth than less engaged projects. Community engagement isn’t just hype; it’s a cornerstone of blockchain adoption. It drives trust, encourages innovation, and attracts partnerships, making it a vital indicator for investors seeking the best crypto to buy now . Dawgz AI harnesses this metric with its “Dawgz Army,” a growing community fueled by 15% of its 8.89 billion token supply dedicated to community rewards. By incentivizing meme creation and social interaction, $DAGZ builds a loyal base, positioning it as a crypto to watch in 2025. This community-driven approach could make it one of the best cryptocurrencies for long-term gains. Dawgz AI: Blending AI Innovation with Meme Culture Unlike traditional meme coins, Dawgz AI ($DAGZ) combines AI-powered trading algorithms with meme-driven community hype, creating a unique value proposition. Its presale, raising over $3.61 million out of the $4.91 target, reflects strong market interest. The project’s blackbox AI system, developed by seasoned Wall Street analysts, analyzes market trends in real-time to optimize yields, offering potential for consistent returns. This blend of fun and utility sets $DAGZ apart from other assets. The community rewards program, allocating 15% of tokens, encourages users to create and share memes, fostering engagement. Additionally, 20% of the token supply is reserved for staking rewards, incentivizing long-term holding. By supporting payments in ETH, USDT, USDC, BNB, and SOL, the presale allows a broad community to join the Dawgz Army. This strategy could drive $DAGZ to prominence in the cryptocurrency space. Why Community Engagement Defines the Best Crypto in 2025 In 2025, community engagement is more critical than ever. A vibrant community expands a project’s reach, secures exchange listings, and builds trust among investors. Dawgz AI’s roadmap, outlined on its website, emphasizes community building across four phases: Puppyhood: Launching the presale and sparking meme-driven hype on social media. Growing the Pack: Strengthening the Dawgz Army through contests and partnerships. Big Dog Stage: Expanding globally with enhanced AI features. Alpha Dog Status: Aiming for mainstream adoption and sustainable growth. This focus on community engagement positions $DAGZ as a crypto to buy for long-term success. Its smart contract, audited by SolidProof on June 4, 2024, ensures security, boosting community confidence. With 24% of tokens allocated to marketing, $DAGZ is set to expand its reach, making it a project to keep an eye on as it prepares for the launch. AI and Blockchain: The Future of Cryptocurrency The integration of AI and blockchain is reshaping the cryptocurrency landscape. Dawgz AI’s AI algorithms are at the heart of its ecosystem, offering potential for high yields through real-time market analysis. This advanced technology, paired with meme culture, makes $DAGZ a standout in the market. The project’s 10% liquidity pool allocation ensures smooth trading on exchanges post-presale, enhancing its appeal. By fostering a community-driven ecosystem, $DAGZ aligns with the growing demand for cryptocurrencies that offer both fun and utility. Its presale price of $0.00438 (set to rise to $0.00474 soon) offers investors an accessible entry point before the price moons. Why Traders Should Prioritize Community in 2025 Community engagement is the backbone of cryptocurrency success. Projects with active, loyal communities are more likely to secure exchange listings, attract investors, and sustain long-term growth. Dawgz AI’s focus on meme culture and AI innovation creates a unique ecosystem that resonates with both retail and institutional investors. Its presale success, raising over $3.61 million and surging, underscores the strength of its community. Stage 8: Checked off the list. ✅Another win on the board. This isn’t luck, it’s strategy, support and solid execution. On to Stage 9 with even more fire. 🔥Don't say we didn't warn you, we know where we’re going and stage 9 is just the next step. ⤴️ pic.twitter.com/aENcREe7U0 — Dawgz AI (@Dawgz_AI) May 20, 2025 By leveraging blockchain security (via its SolidProof-audited smart contract) and AI-driven utility, $DAGZ offers a compelling case for investors looking for the best crypto to buy. The project’s roadmap, with its emphasis on community building and global outreach, positions it for explosive potential in the next bull run.

SXT ( SXT ), the native token of decentralized data platform Space and Time, rose as high as 37% to an intraday high of $0.146 on May 21 morning Asian time. The rally followed Microsoft’s announcement that it would begin integrating real-time blockchain data feeds into Microsoft Fabric through a partnership with Space and Time Labs, a crypto startup previously backed by a Microsoft venture arm. According to the May 20 announcement , the collaboration will allow Microsoft Fabric users to access verifiable data from Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Sui blockchains via Azure OneLake, a cloud data storage solution often described as a “OneDrive for data.” For the uninitiated, Microsoft Fabric is an end-to-end analytics platform that unifies several tools across Microsoft’s data suite, including Azure Data Factory, Synapse Analytics, and Power BI. As part of this integration, enterprise users of Fabric will now be able to incorporate tamper-proof blockchain data directly into their analytics, smart contracts, dashboards, and even AI models. The verifiability of this data is made possible by Space and Time’s proprietary “Proof of SQL” technology, which uses zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to validate SQL database queries securely and efficiently. You might also like: Pi Network hints at trend reversal after pullback, but major obstacles could keep price below $1 Commenting on the development, Nate Holiday, CEO of Space and Time Labs, said: “We’re thrilled to expand our collaboration with Microsoft to provide verifiable blockchain data to enterprises, institutions, and developers building on Fabric. This integration enables a wealth of new data-driven use cases across financial services, Web3 apps, and AI.” This announcement comes around a week after Space and Time launched its public, permissionless mainnet. The platform operates on a decentralized network of database validators and enables sub-second query speeds through its ZK-powered SQL coprocessor. Space and Time was developed by MakeInfinite Labs and is backed by Microsoft ’s venture arm, M12. M12 led the company’s strategic funding round back in 2022 and joined their $20 million Series A round later. So far, Space and Time has raised a total of $50 million. SXT price analysis On the 4-hour chart, SXT has managed to hold strong above the $0.12 support level and is now approaching the key $0.15 psychological resistance. SXT price, Aroon and RSI chart — May 21 | Source: crypto.news The Aroon Up indicator is sitting high at 92.86%, while the Aroon Down is low at 21.43%, a sign that the uptrend is still going strong. The Chaikin Money Flow is at 0.14, showing steady buying pressure is still in play. On top of that, the Relative Strength Index has cooled off to around 62 after briefly hitting overbought territory, which leaves some room for more upward movement. Hence, the next likely target for SXT is its all-time high of $0.1621, and if the bullish momentum continues, it could break into price discovery beyond that level.

Dogecoin, Cardano, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are drawing sharp attention as top cryptocurrencies for savvy investors. Dogecoin’s bullish patterns signal a potential 300% surge, while Cardano’s steady climb rides on whale accumulation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , now in presale phase 4 at $0.025, has raised $9,000,000 with over 500 million tokens sold to 11,000 holders. Phase 4 is 92% filled, and phase 5 looms with a 20% price jump to $0.03. These coins offer unique opportunities for those seeking the next big crypto. Let’s explore why they’re the best cryptos to buy now. Dogecoin’s Bullish Surge Dogecoin is igniting optimism among traders eyeing the best crypto to invest in. Currently trading at $0.24, it’s forming a falling wedge pattern, a bullish signal hinting at a breakout. Analysts note this setup mirrors a past rally that tripled its price. A diamond bottom reversal pattern further fuels confidence, suggesting a shift from selling to buying pressure. Dogecoin’s 53% monthly gain underscores its momentum, outpacing many peers. Whale activity is surging, with 100 million tokens snapped up recently, boosting crypto prices. While volatile, Dogecoin’s technical strength makes it a top crypto to buy. Yet, its speculative nature pales against more structured projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Cardano’s Steady Ascent Cardano is climbing steadily, cementing its place among the best cryptocurrencies to invest in. Priced at $0.784, it’s up 52% from April’s low. Founder Charles Hoskinson predicts a crypto market “heartburn” for two months before a bull run resumes. Whales are accumulating, holding 12.93 billion tokens, driven by upcoming airdrops for DUSK and NIGHT tokens. Cardano’s weekly chart shows a megaphone pattern, suggesting a dip to $0.4 before soaring to $2 by Q4. Cardano’s Midnight project, a zero-knowledge sidechain, adds utility. Cardano’s stability is compelling, but its slower growth contrasts with Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s explosive presale momentum. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Power Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is commanding attention as a top crypto in DeFi. Its presale phase 4, priced at $0.025, is 92% filled, signaling fierce demand. Investors are rushing to secure tokens before phase 5’s price hike to $0.03, a 20% gain for current buyers. The project’s tokenomics guarantee a 140% return at its $0.06 listing price. Analysts predict a post-launch surge to $2.50, yielding a 9,900% ROI. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised $9,000,000, with 500 million tokens sold to 11,000 holders. The team is auditing its smart contract with Certik, with updates soon on socials. This urgency underscores why it’s the best crypto to buy now. Innovative Lending Model Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its lending platform. Users can lend assets to liquidity pools, earning interest based on pool utilization. Borrowers access funds by locking collateral, like $7,000 in ETH for a $5,000 USDT loan, ensuring stability. The buy-and-distribute system uses platform revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers. This creates constant buy pressure, bolstering long-term value. Recently, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launched a dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders, rewarding them with bonus tokens. This innovative approach makes it a standout in crypto investing, surpassing Dogecoin’s speculative allure and Cardano’s gradual climb. Why Mutuum Finance Shines Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s mtTokens are a game-changer. Depositing ETH yields mtETH, which accrues interest over time, offering passive income. These tokens are transferable across DeFi platforms, enhancing utility. A planned overcollateralized stablecoin will further strengthen the ecosystem. Unlike Dogecoin’s reliance on market sentiment or Cardano’s slower innovation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers practical financial tools. Its presale success and structured tokenomics position it as the next crypto to explode. Investors eyeing what crypto to buy for long-term gains find MUTM’s model irresistible. The crypto fear and greed index reflects growing confidence in such utility-driven projects. Seizing Crypto Opportunities Dogecoin, Cardano, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are shaping the crypto market in 2025. Dogecoin’s chart patterns excite traders seeking the next big cryptocurrency. Cardano’s whale-driven growth appeals to those pondering which crypto to buy today for long-term gains. Yet, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) steals the spotlight with its presale fervor and 140% listing return. It’s predicted $2.50 post-launch price makes it a top crypto to invest in. Don’t miss out—research these coins and act fast to join the best cryptocurrency coin to buy. Stay updated on crypto news today to catch the next wave.

Prominent market commentator Fred Krueger detailed his prediction in a 10-part thread on X posted on May 20, painting a hyperbullish picture for BTC powered by monetary instability, institutional Bitcoin adoption, and a full-scale flight from traditional markets. A Doomsday Scenario for Traditional Markets Krueger is basing his thesis on a catastrophic breakdown in U.S. financial stability, beginning with a failed $200 billion Treasury auction in late July 2025. According to his projection, weak demand for U.S. debt will potentially force the Federal Reserve into emergency interventions, sparking a crisis of confidence in the dollar. Within weeks, BRICS nations, led by economic heavyweights China and Russia, will announce a gold-backed global payment system, speeding up the decline of USD dominance and pushing BTC to $180,000. By August, the investor claims the situation will escalate dramatically, with a major U.S. pension fund possibly halting redemptions, which will force the Fed to impose yield cap control that should cap Treasury rates at 6.5% while the dollar goes into freefall. Meanwhile, countries such as Nigeria, Turkey, and Venezuela will ostensibly start shifting foreign reserves into Bitcoin, pushing its price to $265,000, with gold potentially rallying to the $6,700 level. The most explosive phase in the $600,000 timeline will arrive in September, when Krueger predicts several U.S. tech titans, including Apple, Tesla, and Google, will reveal huge BTC holdings, with the iPhone maker allegedly accumulating as much as 200,000 BTC since April. At this juncture, he postulates that the cryptocurrency’s price will have reached $460,000. Additionally, the expert speculates that the IMF will make a historic move, announcing a new global reserve basket with Bitcoin making up half of it, gold covering 30%, and the remaining 20% taken up by other assets. By early October, Krueger claims the U.S. government will be forced to convene an emergency “New Bretton Woods” summit, where it will restructure the dollar to be partially backed by BTC and gold. It is in this macro-maelstrom that he sees the king cryptocurrency hitting $600,000, gold reaching $10,400, and the S&P 500 losing half its value. Strong Fundamentals While Krueger’s roadmap reads like financial fiction, Bitcoin has shown some of the resilience and bullish momentum he’s basing his prediction on. At the time of writing, the asset was trading at $107,000, up a slight 1% in 24 hours, which has put it just 1.3% away from rediscovering its all-time high. On a monthly basis, BTC is up 23.1%, and year-over-year, it has surged 51.6%. Much of this strength comes from steady institutional demand and constrained supply. Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. have recorded eight days of positive flows out of the last ten, with total inflows topping $3.3 billion since the beginning of May, according to Farside Investors. This comes as heavyweights like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet announced additional BTC purchases, totaling nearly $850 million.

What’s often marketed as a seamless, borderless system can become frustrating when transfers fail, with no customer service hotline to call and no easy recourse to reverse mistakes. In the crypto universe, the burden of getting it right falls squarely on the shoulders of the user. But here’s the encouraging part: Most failures are preventable. Understanding why crypto transfers fail can help users avoid costly missteps, navigate the quirks of different networks and send funds with far greater confidence. With a little preparation, you can sidestep common pitfalls and take control of your crypto experience. Did you know? According to a recent survey , 37% of people cite security risks as the most significant barrier to adopting crypto for payments, a reminder of how crucial it is to prioritize security at every step. Common crypto transfer mistakes A single slip — wrong address, wrong network or underpaid fee — tops the list of costly crypto-transfer mistakes. Here’s a quick look at common crypto transfer mistakes: Sending crypto to the wrong address: Blockchain transactions are irreversible. A single wrong character in the recipient’s wallet address can send funds into the void, or worse, into a stranger’s wallet. Choosing the wrong network: Sending Tether USDt ( USDT ) over Ethereum instead of Tron ? That’s a classic mistake. Always match the network to your recipient’s supported network. Underpaying gas or fees: Lowballing crypto gas fees, also known as blockchain transaction fees, can leave your transaction stuck or pending indefinitely. Not double-checking wallet compatibility: Some wallets can’t handle certain tokens or blockchains. Always verify. Sending tokens on the wrong network — like Ethereum instead of BNB Chain — can result in permanent loss. One user learned this the hard way (as shown in the image above) after transferring crypto to Coinbase from Binance using an unsupported network. Failed crypto transaction explained Even perfect-looking transactions can crumble if gas is too low, a smart contract glitches or network congestion spikes. A failed crypto transaction can happen even if all the input details seem right. One major reason is insufficient gas fees . If the gas you set is too low, blockchain validators may ignore your transaction entirely. In some cases, this causes the transaction to fail outright; in others, it remains stuck in a pending state for hours or even days. Smart contract hiccups are another hidden landmine, especially in the decentralized finance (DeFi) world. If the contract’s code has flaws or can’t handle your input, your transaction can bounce back. Add in network congestion — especially on high-traffic chains like Ethereum , where every block is a battle for space — and even well-planned transfers can stall or fail without warning. Did You Know? A study analyzing over 1.5 billion failed transactions on the Solana blockchain found that bot spamming and network congestion were significant contributors to transaction failures. Crypto transfer troubleshooting guide A quick five-point checklist (address, network, explorer status, wallet queue, asset support) usually reveals why funds haven’t landed. If your crypto transfer isn’t received, don’t panic. Check these first: Confirm the recipient’s address is correct. Verify the transfer network (was it Ethereum , BNB Smart Chain (BSC) , Polygon , etc.). Check the status on a block explorer (like Etherscan for Ethereum or Solscan for Solana). Review your wallet and see if the transfer is still pending . Make sure the recipient wallet supports the asset you sent. If you catch an issue early, some platforms allow you to speed up or cancel a stuck transaction by paying a higher gas fee . What to check before sending crypto Prevention is your best friend. Before sending any crypto, take a few moments to verify all the critical details. Always double-check the recipient’s wallet address. The safest method is copy-paste; never type it out manually. Ensure that the address belongs to the correct network and is compatible with the token you’re sending. Make sure the address matches the right network and can handle the token you’re sending. And don’t forget the fees. On Ethereum, for example, you’ll need some ETH in your wallet to cover gas or that transfer’s going nowhere. Also, confirm the receiving wallet can accept the token and that you're not hitting any daily or regional transfer limits imposed by the platform. Did You Know? A single copy-paste mistake cost one crypto trader $26 million in Renzo Restaked ETH (ezETH). The tokens were sent to the wrong wallet address, and recovery was impossible, even with white hat hackers trying to help. Crypto transfer speed and networks Different blockchains clear at various speeds, so match your urgency to a network’s typical confirmation time. Chains like Solana , Avalanche and Tron blaze through transactions in seconds, leaving older titans like Bitcoin and Ethereum catching their breath, especially when network traffic spikes and block space gets tight. And they’re not alone. Newer players like Aptos and Sui are also pushing the limits of scale and throughput, signaling a fierce race for speed across the crypto ecosystem. That’s why knowing the average speed of the network you’re using matters. Sending Bitcoin ( BTC )? Expect to wait around 10 minutes per confirmation, there are 6 of them. Moving USDT on Solana ? It should arrive almost instantly. Being aware of these differences helps set realistic expectations and avoid unnecessary panic when a transfer lags. And when every second counts — whether you’re racing to secure a trade or make a payment — choosing a fast crypto network can save you time and stress. How the crypto Travel Rule can cause transfer failures Regulatory hurdles like the Travel Rule can freeze transfers if sender or recipient data doesn’t line up across jurisdictions. The crypto Travel Rule requires virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to share key details about the sender and recipient when handling transfers above set limits. If that information is missing, incomplete, or doesn’t match up, your transaction can hit a wall, often getting delayed or blocked entirely. This issue pops up frequently in cross-border transfers or when moving funds to exchanges. Other problems arise from the “ sunrise issue ,” where some countries have adopted the Travel Rule and others haven’t. This mismatch can lead to compliance conflicts and blocked transactions. Self-hosted wallets also present a challenge: Some VASPs won’t process transfers to wallets they can’t verify. As regulations tighten, expect more of these friction points in crypto transfers. Did you know? A report by Cointelegraph Research and Onramper found that 50% of fiat-to-crypto transactions fail, even when users have completed Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. User location, banking restrictions and local regulations all play a role in whether those transactions succeed or collapse. How to avoid failed crypto transactions Send a test amount, watch live gas trackers and never rush. Slow, informed moves keep transactions from failing. Avoiding failed transactions comes down to awareness and caution. First, always test with a small amount before transferring large sums. This gives you a chance to catch mistakes without losing much. Second, always monitor current gas fees, especially on volatile networks like Ethereum. Tools like Etherscan Gas Tracker and Blocknative Gas Estimator give live Ethereum gas prices. Many wallets (like MetaMask ) also show gas estimates in the app. Using a reputable crypto wallet that offers real-time fee suggestions and transaction previews helps immensely. Finally, take your time. Many failed transactions happen simply because users are in a rush or feeling pressured to act fast. In crypto, speed can kill your funds. Did you know? One user paid $200 in gas fees on Ethereum for a failed transaction that returned nothing. The cause? Slippage settings were off, and the network still charged full fees. How to verify a crypto transfer Plug the transaction hash into a block explorer for an instant verdict on whether your transfer is pending, confirmed or failed. Once you send crypto, the transaction hash becomes your receipt. Paste it into a block explorer of the chain you used, like Etherscan, Solscan or Tronscan, to get live updates. This will tell you if the transaction is pending, confirmed or failed, along with timestamps, block numbers and fee details. Some wallets and exchanges now offer built-in tracking tools that integrate directly with explorers. These make it easier for beginners to stay informed without needing to navigate third-party websites. If a transfer seems stuck, checking the status this way should always be your first move. Mastering crypto transfers: Confidence over chaos Triple-checking details, monitoring fees and staying curious turns crypto transfers from a gamble into a confident routine. One wrong digit, one wrong network, and your funds could vanish into the void. This isn’t just about saving your wallet; it’s about owning your peace of mind. As blockchains scale and regulations tighten, the winners are those who move smart, not just fast. So here’s the vibe: Slow down to level up. Triple-check that address. Know the platform you’re using. Watch those fees. Stay cool when networks get jammed. The pros don’t rush; they prepare. Back up your keys. Keep your tools sharp. Stay curious and keep learning, because the crypto game rewards those who respect it. Master the flow, and you trade chaos for confidence. That’s when crypto becomes your playground.",crypto transfers,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|SOL|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinTelegraph', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cointelegraph.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cointelegraph,2025-05-21 07:35:00

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Utility tokens are evolving from hype to substance, as MBG by MultiBank Group leads a new wave of regulation-first, infrastructure-backed crypto tied to real-world finance. Table of Contents A new approach: Beginning with infrastructure A landmark $3 billion tokenization agreement in the UAE Focus on regulation and legal clarity Real-world assets and the future of digital finance Utility tokens presented a straightforward concept: digital assets that projects could utilize to access services, pay fees, or earn incentives. However, in practice, many tokens have struggled to demonstrate genuine utility. Some debuted before a functioning product was ready. Others functioned under unclear legal conditions, preventing consumers from understanding the potential uses and locations of the tokens. The disparity between token supply and platform readiness has raised questions about whether most utility tokens serve a useful purpose or are primarily fundraising tools. A new approach: Beginning with infrastructure One movement in the space includes connecting tokens to functional, regulated financial institutions. MultiBank Group , a financial firm located in Dubai, has embraced this approach with its upcoming coin, MBG. Instead of launching first and then constructing, the business planned ahead of time to establish its infrastructure. The goal is to incorporate token-based functionality into current platforms that already serve retail, institutional, and digital asset customers throughout the world. These include transaction management, awards, and tier-based access, all inside existing systems. A landmark $3 billion tokenization agreement in the UAE In a significant step toward connecting traditional banking with web3, MultiBank Group has struck a $3 billion real-world asset (RWA) tokenization deal with MAG, the UAE’s top real estate developer, and Mavryk, a blockchain technology startup. The agreement focuses on digitizing real estate assets, which involves transforming their ownership or value into blockchain-based tokens that may be monitored, exchanged, or retained digitally. This is one of the world’s greatest real estate tokenization endeavors to date. This is a growing interest in utilizing blockchain to represent assets that exist outside of the crypto realm, resulting in increased transparency, possible liquidity, and automation of complicated ownership systems. You might also like: Bridging traditional finance and blockchain: The strategic positioning of MBG Focus on regulation and legal clarity Regulation, or the lack thereof, has been an obstacle to many digital asset ventures. 17 financial licenses, including those from Australia (ASIC), the UAE (VARA), and India (FIU), regulate the MultiBank ecosystem. This implies that any new digital components, including tokenized assets, will operate inside predefined legal frameworks. Clear regulatory footing protects consumers and opens the door to partnership with larger institutions that have hitherto shunned blockchain owing to compliance issues. As part of its token strategy, MultiBank intends to progressively limit the number of MBG tokens via buyback-and-burn techniques backed by company activities. This technique differs from inflationary token models, in which supply rises with time. A deflationary system can impact long-term token behavior, although the outcomes vary based on use and market conditions. Real-world assets and the future of digital finance The rising emphasis on real-world asset tokenization indicates a change in how digital finance may evolve. Rather than operating independently of traditional markets, blockchain-based solutions are beginning to integrate with established industries such as real estate and banking. For both observers and players, these trends point to a future in which digital assets are no longer merely speculative tools but integral parts of broader financial systems.

The disclosure came via a May 19 post on X, where Sun announced that he had secured an invite to an exclusive dinner with the former U.S. president, scheduled to be held at the president’s golf club near Washington, D.C. Sun to Attend Trump Dinner as Top Memecoin Holder According to Sun, his wallet, which holds around $19 million worth of the TRUMP token at a trading price of $13.20, earned him a top spot among the 220 holders eligible for the May 22 dinner. More notably, being the leading wallet on the leaderboard also grants Sun access to a private reception and VIP tour reserved for the top 25 token holders. He stated that he plans to “talk crypto” and “discuss the future” of the industry at the event. The crypto community had long speculated that Sun was behind the wallet, especially after his previous $75 million investment into Trump-backed crypto ventures through World Liberty Financial — a platform reportedly supported by Trump’s sons. This included a $30 million token purchase shortly after the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Sun also serves as an adviser to the firm, further tightening his link to the Trump crypto ecosystem. Concerns Over Influence and Regulation Sun’s involvement has raised red flags among lawmakers, particularly those wary of political influence being bought through crypto investments. The timing of his announcement — just hours after the Senate advanced the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins — has intensified concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren criticized the move, calling it a sign of “corruption” that the GENIUS Act fails to address. During a May 20 congressional hearing, Representative Glenn Ivey questioned SEC Chair Paul Atkins about the timing of Sun’s stayed legal case and his ties to Trump’s ventures. Although Atkins assumed office after the SEC agreed to pause its lawsuit against Sun — which involves allegations of unregistered securities offerings and market manipulation — Ivey pointed to the troubling proximity between Sun’s crypto activities and regulatory decisions. As of May 20, other confirmed attendees of the dinner include notable figures from the crypto world, such as Vincent Liu of Kronos Research and Synthetix founder Kain Warwick.

But just as price began to surge, something unexpected happened, Ethereum co-founder Jeffrey Wilcke quietly moved 262 million of ETH to the Kraken exchange. This move surprised many and raised the big question: Is he planning to sell? As his past actions suggest that a major sell-off might be on the way. $262 Million in ETH—Gone in a Flash? According to on-chain tracker Arkham, Wilcke transferred more than 105,000 ETH (about $262 million) to Kraken. What’s even more surprising is that this wallet had been mostly inactive for months. And the timing? It happened right after ETH broke past the $2,600 mark. ARKHAM ALERT: ETHEREUM COFOUNDER JEFFREY WILCKE JUST SENT $262M OF ETH TO KRAKEN pic.twitter.com/tgUpS0mCBJ — Arkham (@arkham) May 20, 2025 Following the transfer, Wilcke’s ETH holdings dropped to under 300 coins. The last time he made such a large move was in November 2024, just before Ethereum hit a 12-month high, after which the price corrected. So naturally, this triggered fears that another major dump might be on the way. Is He Selling? Or Just Moving Funds? At first glance, the transaction looked like a sign that Wilcke might sell. But shortly after the deposit, eight new wallets withdrew the same amount of ETH from Kraken. This led some analysts to believe he may have simply redistributed his funds rather than offloading them. Interestingly, Wilcke even reposted news of the transaction, but didn’t offer any explanation. His silence has kept people guessing, but the activity doesn’t clearly point to a dump So while the recent transfer looked dramatic, it may not have been a bearish move after all. Impact On ETH Price Despite the massive transfer, Ethereum’s price held up well. As of now, ETH is trading around $2607, reflecting a rise of 2.24%, with the market cap hitting $314 billion. Despite the major move, one positive signal is that Ethereum’s supply on exchanges has dropped to just 4.9%, the lowest in 10 years. That suggests fewer people are preparing to sell, which is often seen as a positive signal for long-term holders. Meanwhile, there are also some concerns about a possible bug in the EIP-7702 upgrade, which might slow Ethereum’s recent momentum.",News|Uncategorized,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|ARKM,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-05-21 07:45:00

In a recent post , Buterin commented on an X user’s skeptical take on an announcement from Succinct Lab’s co-founder Uma Roy about her team’s recent demo of a full “zkVM” proof system for the ecosystem’s execution layer. Although Buterin does congratulate the Succinct team on their progress, he proceeds to point out four areas that the project — as well as the wider network — needs to tackle in order to make real-time proving a reliable feature for users on the Layer1 . “So, truly amazing work by @pumatheuma and team, but definitely still a few steps to the final destination,” said Buterin. Buterin underlined how the Succinct Labs’ demo for real-time Ethereum ( ETH ) proving mechanism was tested out on average-case timings, not worst case tests. He emphasized the need for worst case timings in order to make the mechanism safe for wider L1 use. Moreover, he stated in his post that the Ethereum team aims to raise the Layer1 gas limit by 10 to 100 times its current rate. According to data from YCharts, Ethereum’s current average gas limit is at 35.99 million, a slight increase from yesterday’s average gas limit which stood at 35.98 million. “We wanna 10-100x the L1 gas limit,” said Buterin. Ethereum’s gas limit has reached 35.99 million in the past 24 hours, May 21, 2025 | Source: YCharts You might also like: Binance founder proposes lowering BSC gas fees by three to 10 times Buterin also said Succinct’s proving mechanism still lacks formal verification, which is necessary to assure users that it is seamless and relatively bug-free. Not only that, the real-time proving system still needs around 100 kilowatts of power to churn out proofs at the demonstrated speed. Buterin argued that to make it available for broader participation, the energy cost needed to generate proofs should be around as low as 10 kW. This way, the energy rate is home-use friendly and would enable small teams or individuals to run their own real-time proofs. What is Ethereum’s current gas limit? Compared to a year ago, on May 21, 2024, the ecosystem’s gas limit has increased by nearly 20%. The number increased by nearly 6 million from 30 million one year ago. If Ethereum does manage to raise its gas limit by 10 to 100 times, its gas limit could reach as high as 360 million to 3600 million. Ethereum’s gas limit represents the maximum gas units needed to process a transaction or smart contract on the network. It acts as a cap, preventing transactions from using excessive resources that could lead to high fees or generating congestion on the network. Even if real-time proving mechanisms become available on-chain, each one requires a considerable amount of gas. Therefore, in order to make it viable at scale, it would require a higher gas limit compared to what the network’s current block gas limit would allow. Last February, the Ethereum network raised its gas limit for the first time since 2021. The gas limit reached 32 million gas units, surpassing 30 million for the first time in nearly five years. At the time, around 51.1% of validators approved the gas limit adjustment without a hard fork.

Cú tăng giá gần đây mang đậm dấu ấn của thị trường spot , với những pha bứt phá mạnh mẽ sau những giai đoạn ngắn gọn và rõ ràng để nghỉ xả hơi. Điều này cho thấy việc tích lũy diễn ra lành mạnh và nhu cầu tiềm ẩn rất vững chắc, thay vì bị thúc đẩy bởi các yếu tố đầu cơ thái quá. Dữ liệu Khối lượng Delta tích lũy (CVD) trên các sàn lớn vẫn giữ mức dương, khẳng định rằng những người mua thực sự — chứ không phải dân đánh đòn bẩy — đang chiếm ưu thế trong cuộc đua này. Trong khi đó, thị trường phái sinh đang ở trạng thái phản ứng , với các biến động về khối lượng mở (OI) cho thấy giai đoạn chuyển đổi, nơi các cú ép bán và thanh lý hàng loạt giúp làm sạch lớp bọt bẩn trên thị trường. Kết quả là nền tảng hiện tại trở nên sạch sẽ hơn, với đà tăng được hỗ trợ bởi dòng vốn thực chất thay vì những cơn sốt nhất thời. Với giá Bitcoin vừa điều chỉnh nhẹ sau khi đạt mức cao kỷ lục, mức chênh lệch giá (premium) thị trường giao ngay vẫn khá cao, hành động giá đi ngang hiện tại có thể chỉ đơn giản là một khoảng thời gian lấy sức trước khi bùng nổ. Mặc dù các đợt điều chỉnh nhỏ vẫn có khả năng xảy ra, xu hướng lớn vẫn đang nghiêng về phía tích cực. Mặc dù Bitcoin đang bay cao, nhưng các dấu hiệu cảnh báo tiếp tục xuất hiện trên nền kinh tế Mỹ, khi lạm phát giảm dần nhưng những rủi ro cấu trúc sâu hơn bắt đầu lộ rõ. Chỉ số giá tiêu dùng (Consumer Price Index – CPI) chỉ tăng 0.2% so với tháng trước và tăng 2.3% so với năm ngoái—mức tăng thấp nhất kể từ đầu 2021. Giá thực phẩm giảm đã giúp làm dịu bớt áp lực từ chi phí nhà ở, nhưng triển vọng vẫn còn mờ mịt do bất ổn quanh thuế quan và chính sách thương mại. Dù Mỹ và Trung Quốc đã đạt được thỏa thuận ngừng bắn tạm thời, các mức thuế nhập khẩu lớn vẫn đang tồn tại, và nhiều khả năng sẽ có thêm thuế mới vào tháng 7 tới. Những căng thẳng thương mại chưa được giải quyết này tạo ra thách thức lớn cho cả doanh nghiệp và giới hoạch định chính sách. Đồng thời, áp lực tài chính đang đè nặng lên các hộ gia đình. Số liệu từ Fed New York cho thấy tỷ lệ nợ tín dụng và vay sinh viên quá hạn trên 90 ngày đang tăng lên, vẽ nên bức tranh u ám về tình hình tài chính cá nhân. Khi tác động của thuế quan bắt đầu cắn, cùng với rủi ro lạm phát tiếp tục treo lơ lửng, sự kết hợp giữa tăng trưởng chậm và giá cả leo thang—hay còn gọi là lạm phát đình trệ (stagflation) —có thể khiến Cục Dự trữ Liên bang (Fed) rơi vào thế khó. Hiện tại, với chi phí dịch vụ lõi và nhà ở vẫn còn ở mức cao, Fed nhiều khả năng sẽ tiếp tục thận trọng. Tuy nhiên, khi áp lực kinh tế ngày càng gia tăng, những tháng tới sẽ đòi hỏi sự linh hoạt và cảnh giác cao độ. Dù thị trường có lúc chập chờn và quy định pháp lý vẫn là câu chuyện dài kỳ, việc chấp nhận Bitcoin trong giới doanh nghiệp và tổ chức vẫn đang phát triển mạnh mẽ. Quỹ đầu tư Mubadala của Abu Dhabi đã tăng cường nắm giữ cổ phần trong quỹ ETF Bitcoin spot của BlackRock (IBIT) trong quý 1/2025, thể hiện niềm tin dài hạn mặc cho giá trị thị trường của IBIT tạm thời sụt giảm. Kể từ khi ra mắt vào tháng 1/2024, IBIT đã dẫn đầu thị trường ETF spot tại Mỹ, thu hút hơn $45.5 tỷ dòng tiền chảy vào và quản lý tổng cộng $65.4 tỷ tài sản. Tại Mỹ Latinh, công ty fintech Méliuz của Brazil đã trở thành công ty đại chúng đầu tiên trong khu vực áp dụng chiến lược dự trữ Bitcoin. Sau khi mua 274.52 BTC trị giá $28.4 triệu , tổng số Bitcoin họ sở hữu giờ đã vượt 320 BTC . Động thái này nhận được sự ủng hộ mạnh mẽ từ cổ đông và khiến giá cổ phiếu công ty tăng vọt 116% , minh chứng cho sự ủng hộ của nhà đầu tư đối với chiến lược tài chính dựa trên crypto. Tuy nhiên, khung pháp lý vẫn là một trận chiến cam go. Một thẩm phán Mỹ vừa bác bỏ đề nghị chung giữa SEC (Ủy ban Chứng khoán và Giao dịch) và Ripple nhằm giảm nhẹ hình phạt và dỡ bỏ các hạn chế, viện dẫn lỗi thủ tục do vụ án đang trong quá trình kháng cáo. Quyết định này tạm thời chặn đứng một thỏa thuận tiềm năng trong vụ kiện mang tính bước ngoặt, có thể định hình tương lai của quy định crypto tại Mỹ. Tất cả những sự kiện này phản ánh cả động lực lẫn thách thức mà crypto đang đối mặt trong hành trình tiến vào hệ thống tài chính toàn cầu.

Theta Capital Management has pulled in over $175 million for a new fund-of-funds designed to help institutional investors get exposure to early-stage blockchain startups by backing some of the industry’s top crypto venture firms. The new fund, dubbed Theta Blockchain Ventures IV, will invest in venture capital firms that specialize in crypto, Bloomberg has learned , referring to Ruud Smets, the company’s managing partner and chief investment officer. Founded in 2001, the Netherlands-based firm began focusing on cryptocurrencies in 2018 and now manages around $1.2 billion in assets. Theta has previously backed firms like Coinfund, Polychain Capital, and Castle Island Ventures. It’s still unclear though how Theta plans to allocate the newly raised capital.

According to a May 14 report by PitchBook, VC deal value in Q1 rose to $6 billion, more than double the $2.6 billion seen a year ago. However, the number of deals fell to 405 from 670 over the same period. PitchBook’s senior crypto analyst Robert Le said the $1.4 billion Bybit theft , which he described as the first and only “10-digit hack in history,” served as a stark reminder of the operational risks still present in the industry. He suggested the incident could drive greater institutional demand for real-time proof-of-reserve tools, improved custody systems, and middleware that simplifies key management. Le also said startups working on these areas might find a more favorable funding environment, even amid a broader reset in valuations. Despite Bitcoin hitting a record high of $100,000 in Q4 2024, venture capital activity in crypto startups remained flat , with VC deal size down nearly 90% since 2018.

He noted that NYC had sufficient experts to help New Yorkers navigate solutions through blockchain technology. Speaking at the first ever crypto summit hosted at the mayor’s official residence, Gracie Mansion, Adams asserted that NYC was “open for ‘crypto’ business” and the proposed digital assets council would be composed of industry individuals, with a chair to be confirmed in the coming weeks. Mayor Adams vows to make New York City the “crypto capital of the globe” We're taking the next step in becoming the Crypto Capitol of the WORLD, hosting our city's first-ever Crypto and Digital Assets Summit! Join us LIVE as we get started: https://t.co/iwO6ThkaSB — Mayor Eric Adams (@NYCMayor) May 20, 2025 Mayor Adams said at the crypto conference on Tuesday that he wanted to make New York City the “crypto capital of the globe” and will make policy recommendations in the coming weeks. He also pointed out that in addition to business interests, the city will explore putting birth and death records onto a blockchain to help New Yorkers’ next of kin easily access these types of documents. Adams told the inaugural NYC crypto summit on May 20 that the plan to establish the city’s crypto advisory council was not about chasing memes and trends. He added that the world is currently in the age of tokenization—which includes, blockchain, and other fintech innovations—and NYC was going to continue to move forward with it. “We want to use technology of tomorrow to better serve New Yorkers today … That means supporting the development of a more diverse, equitable, inclusive tech ecosystem. We must embrace this emerging technology and build on the success of our economy.” ~ Eric Adams, the Mayor of New York City The self-proclaimed “tech mayor” also revealed his history as a computer programmer, highlighting that he was one of the original architects of OLTPS, the precursor to COMPStat. He disclosed that he came into the tech world with a real mindset that technology could improve the lives of people, and the establishment of the crypto advisory council was part of “the evolution of that improvement.” NYC Mayor asks crypto companies to set up shop in the Empire State Mayor Adams made a pitch to crypto companies returning to the U.S. or expanding their presence in the country to set up shop in New York City. He said at a previous press briefing at Gracie Mansion that the city of New York should be looking forward to building crypto empires. Adams, who is running for reelection, reiterated his commitment to making NYC a crypto hub, telling reporters that he would work with tech and crypto companies—both big and small—to create a friendly environment to attract and help them succeed. He added that his goal remained the same as it was on day one as mayor, helping President Trump make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet.” Adams also claimed that New York would attract world-class talent, provide opportunities for underbanked communities, and make the government more user-friendly. He pointed out that his office was focused on the long-term value of these technologies for the city and its people. In the past, Adams was critical of Bitlicense, claiming that it stifled regulation, and he advocated scrapping it shortly after taking office as mayor in 2022. He, however, seemed to strike a more conciliatory tone towards NYDFS, saying that it was good to know that the city would have safe regulations in place for those who were investing and that there would not be any abuses.

As investors seek alternatives to traditional staking options like BNB, Unilabs presents a compelling opportunity to benefit from automated fund management and passive income. The platform’s AI-backed structure, staking utility, and strong referral rewards have sparked speculation that it could challenge the staking dominance of Binance Coin. Unilabs: The First AI Asset Manager Revolutionizing Crypto Portfolios As the first decentralized AI asset manager, Unilabs holds responsibility for assets worth more than $30 million in AUM. The purpose of Unilabs is to help investors set aside emotional influences by using real-time machine learning, creating four distinct funds: There are the AI Fund, the BTC Fund, the RWA Fund, and the Mining Fund. The multifaceted funds fuse DeFi with traditional models to let users access Bitcoin along with tokenized yield opportunities, while leaving portfolio management to the Unilabs AI. Instead of speculating manually, Unilabs users gain intelligent, rebalanced exposure to crypto’s fastest-growing sectors. With tokenized yield, dynamic risk profiles, and on-chain NAV tracking, Unilabs creates a bridge between traditional asset management logic and DeFi’s speed, offering an increasingly popular alternative to BNB staking products. In fact, many early adopters are reallocating funds from Binance Coin to protocols like Unilabs for their AI-powered alpha generation. The Current Opportunity: 21.5% Gains at Presale Price The Unilabs presale is live, and the window to buy in before the next price tier closes is narrowing quickly. With over 155 million UNI tokens sold, demand is clearly surging. Currently priced at $0.0051, the next presale tier will move the token price to $0.0062, giving new buyers an opportunity to lock in a 21.5% immediate ROI, a gain that’s purely based on entering early. This isn’t just a speculative play; it’s a calculated move for investors looking to front-run the next valuation bump in a project backed by AI and $30M AUM. The UNIL token itself is more than just a trading chip. It’s a multi-utility asset designed for long-term engagement. Holders benefit from staking rewards, which fuel liquidity across the platform’s diversified funds. Finally, governance rights give every UNI holder a say in how the platform’s strategies evolve, ensuring the community drives decision-making. Unlike BNB, which focuses heavily on validator-based staking, Unilabs enables users to have a direct say in fund performance through transparent AI metrics. Binance Coin Dominance Meets Real AI Competition Just this week, BNB Chain recorded a surge in user and network activity, with daily transactions climbing past 8 million and active wallet addresses exceeding 2 million. Binance’s native token, BNB, price also spiked to $648, a three-month high, fueled by rising on-chain activity and a key development. The proposed ETF has ignited bullish speculation about Binance coin’s future as an institutional-grade crypto asset, further lifting sentiment across the Binance ecosystem. Source : CoinMarketCap However, BNB’s staking and DeFi dominance may no longer be unchallenged. As capital floods into Layer-1s and DeFi-native platforms, investors increasingly seek platforms that offer more than just staking rewards. They want active asset management, real diversification, and access to early-stage alpha capabilities that Unilabs delivers through enterprise-grade AI and structured investment products. Unilabs is quickly emerging as a serious contender other than Binance coin in the next evolution of decentralized finance. While BNB Chain continues to lead in raw transaction volume and validator uptime, its staking system and DeFi structure may soon appear static compared to Unilabs’ dynamic asset management ecosystem. Conclusion Unilabs isn’t a concept; it’s a live, growing protocol with $30M in managed assets and a presale that’s gathering serious momentum. Early participants in protocols like Lido and Yearn Finance saw outsized returns by entering before public listings. Unilabs may be next. Binance coin remains a dominant force, but dominance can erode. As more users demand smart asset management, diversified staking, and performance-linked rewards, platforms like Unilabs could rewrite the rules. The UNIL token offers exposure to a fully automated financial machine with real-time AI execution and a referral-powered ecosystem. With staking, diversified fund access, and real-time performance tracking, Unilabs gives retail investors the tools previously reserved for hedge funds.

The British multinational bank said sovereign entities increased their indirect exposure to the world’s largest cryptocurrency in the first quarter by buying shares in Strategy (MSTR), noting that the trend bolsters its half-million BTC price projection. Increasing Allocations To MSTR Is Bullish For Bitcoin Roughly 12 government entities increased their exposure to MSTR in Q1, holding 31,000 Bitcoin worth of Strategy shares, Standard Chartered’s global head of digital assets research, Geoffrey Kendrick, wrote in a Tuesday note to clients. Although investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin through spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that were greenlighted in the U.S. in 2024, government entities’ increased Strategy holdings reflect “widening structural demand” for Bitcoin and Strategy’s continued use as a Bitcoin proxy, Kendrick explained. “We believe that in some cases, MSTR holdings by government entities reflect a desire to gain Bitcoin exposure where local regulations do not allow direct BTC holdings,” he added. Government entities upped their MSTR holdings during the first quarter, with Norway’s Government Pension Fund, the Swiss National Bank, and South Korea’s pension and investment bodies each adding the equivalent of 700 BTC. Meanwhile, United States state retirement funds across California, New York, North Carolina, and Kentucky added a combined 1,000 BTC equivalent. Sweden and Liechtenstein made minor increases, while France and Saudi Arabia took first-time positions, albeit tiny, indicating growing sovereign interest in indirect BTC exposure, according to Kendrick. “The latest 13F data from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) supports our core thesis that Bitcoin will reach the $500,000 level before Trump leaves office as it attracts a wider range of institutional buyers,” the banker opined. The latest first quarter 13F filings — reports that institutional investment managers with at least $100 million in assets under management are required to file each quarter — indicate that sovereigns’ exposure to Bitcoin via spot exchange-traded funds “was disappointing at first glance,” while increasing MSTR holdings were “very encouraging,” Standard Chartered said. The most notable ETF move came from the State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which sold off its entire 3,400 BTC-equivalent stake in BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust. Kendrick argued that these 13F filings are the best way to test “our thesis that BTC will attract new institutional buyer types as the market matures,” pushing the price of the asset to the $500,000 milestone. “When institutions buy Bitcoin, prices tend to rise,” he summarized.",Cryptocurrency|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-21 07:52:20

According to a May 20 filing , Blackstone bought just around $1.08 million worth of BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT), despite boasting approximately $1.2 trillion in assets under management. Blackstone reported holding 23,094 shares of IBIT at the end of the fiscal quarter ending March 31. The IBIT shares were added to Blackstone’s Alternative Multi-Strategy Fund (BTMIX), which holds $2.63 billion worth of assets, as per Google Finance data. This is the first time the asset manager has disclosed investing in anything crypto-related. Despite IBIT’s outstanding performance, it appears that Blackstone is not yet ready to commit substantial capital to investing in the apex crypto. It’s worth mentioning that Blackstone has largely steered clear of crypto. Back in September 2019, Blackstone co-founder and CEO Stephen Schwarzman said he liked the blockchain technology but thought its use for money was “pretty odd.” “[I was] raised in a world where someone needs to control currencies,” he noted at the time. Schwarzman further admitted he wasn’t much of a fan of Bitcoin, citing difficulties understanding the technology. BlackRock On Track To Overtake Satoshi’s Bitcoin Stash BlackRock’s IBIT has drawn in a net inflow of over $46 billion since it went live on Wall Street in January 2024, signaling institutions’ persistent confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a recent post on X that BlackRock is now the second-biggest Bitcoin holder globally, trailing only the mysterious BTC inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Balchunas believes the asset manager is poised to surpass Satoshi’s holdings by next summer. The pundit reckons that if the Bitcoin price climbs to $150,000 in the coming months, it could spark a “feeding frenzy” among financial advisors, which would help BlackRock attain this milestone even more quickly.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Blackrock,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-05-21 07:55:58

In a post on X, he pointed to XRP and RLUSD as mechanisms that could reshape how value moves across borders. Aljarrah pointed out that banks currently hold capital in Nostro/Vostro accounts, but XRP eliminates this requirement, which many now see as a fundamental inefficiency in the traditional banking system. He then added that RLUSD can tokenize collateralized debt, and these tokenized treasuries could significantly transform sovereign debt markets. Banks hold capital in Nostro/Vostro accounts — XRP eliminates that friction. Governments collateralize debt with treasuries — RLUSD tokenizes it. Now imagine this entire system operating 24/7 across borders. pic.twitter.com/BRqHvEzaNB — Versan | Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) May 19, 2025 The Role of XRP in Streamlining Cross-Border Settlements The traditional international banking system relies on Nostro and Vostro accounts, where correspondent banks hold foreign currency balances to facilitate cross-border transactions. This system often results in idle capital and slow settlement times. XRP functions as a bridge asset that enables real-time settlement between currencies. It allows institutions to avoid pre-funding accounts in foreign currencies, thus reducing capital lockup and operational delays. Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) system, which utilizes XRP, is already employed worldwide to simplify and accelerate cross-border transfers. The core advantage is XRP’s ability to settle transactions in seconds, offering near-instant finality. This addresses a long-standing issue in the global financial system, where delays in settlement can lead to counterparty risks and liquidity inefficiencies. Tokenizing Treasuries with RLUSD Governments traditionally issue treasuries to finance debt, and these instruments are widely used as collateral in financial markets. However, access to them, particularly across borders and outside regular trading hours, remains constrained by legacy systems. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Aljarrah suggests that RLUSD could tokenize U.S. dollar-denominated assets, such as treasuries, onto blockchain infrastructure. Ripple is making strides in the tokenization market, as real-world asset tokenization could bring significant growth to the crypto space. By tokenizing treasuries, RLUSD could become more than just a stable digital representation of the U.S. dollar, but serve as a programmable, on-chain instrument backed by sovereign-grade assets. This could open new pathways for collateralization and liquidity management in decentralized finance (DeFi) and institutional markets. The Future of Global Finance XRP and RLUSD illustrate Ripple’s vision for a borderless, always-on financial system. XRP removes the inefficiencies of pre-funded accounts in foreign currencies, while RLUSD introduces tokenized, liquid collateral that can be moved and settled around the clock. Some analysts believe tokenization is just the start , and with these assets, Ripple could play a major role in global finance in the coming years.

At this point, Binance made both a delisting and listing announcement today. Accordingly, announcements came for AWE, ACA, MASK and TRU. Binance announced that it will list the altcoin AWE Network (AWE) on Binance Simple Earn, Buy Crypto, Binance Convert, Binance Margin and Binance Futures, while delisting ACA/BTC, MASK/BNB, TRU/BTC spot trading pairs. “Binance is pleased to announce that AWE Network (AWE) will be added to Binance Simple Earn, Buy Crypto, Binance Convert, Binance Margin, and Binance Futures at the respective dates and times listed below.

Binance also announced that it will delist ACA/BTC, MASK/BNB, TRU/BTC spot trading pairs. “To protect users and maintain a high-quality trading market, Binance periodically reviews all listed spot trading pairs and may delist certain spot trading pairs due to various factors such as poor liquidity and trading volume.

44893910,https://timestabloid.com/?p=67873,1747814896,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,XRP ETF Sees Fresh Delay. Here’s What the SEC Says,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-etf-sees-fresh-delay-heres-what-the-sec-says/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has again postponed its decisions on spot-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposals tied to cryptocurrencies, including XRP and Dogecoin. Among those impacted are filings submitted by Grayscale, 21Shares , and a separate application for the Grayscale Dogecoin Trust. According to documents recently published on the SEC’s official site, the agency has formally initiated proceedings to assess the proposed products further. As part of this process, the commission is inviting feedback from the public to aid its evaluation of the legal and regulatory implications surrounding these ETF proposals. Bitwise Ethereum ETF Staking Amendment Also Faces Delay Also, the SEC has deferred its ruling on an amendment tied to the Bitwise Ethereum ETF. The amendment seeks to include staking options, potentially enabling investors to earn additional returns through network participation. This feature is a step toward increasing investor exposure to yield-generating opportunities in the Ethereum ecosystem. The agency is delaying its decision and seeking public input, indicating the issue needs more review. Public Consultation Opens as Regulator Seeks Broader Perspective The SEC’s call for public input reflects its ongoing effort to navigate the evolving crypto investment landscape. While no formal conclusions have been reached, the regulator emphasized that the proposals raise complex questions deserving of in-depth public discourse. Stakeholders have 21 days to submit comments and up to 35 days for rebuttal comments after publication in the Federal Register. Delays Consistent with SEC’s Pattern on Crypto ETFs For market watchers, the latest round of deferrals comes as no surprise. Over the past several months, the SEC has repeatedly extended review timelines for various crypto-linked ETFs. Notably, in March, the agency delayed rulings on applications from Grayscale, 21Shares, VanEck, and Canary. At that time, the decision on Grayscale’s XRP Trust ETF was moved to May 21. That deadline has been pushed back further as the commission continues to examine whether the ETF proposals meet regulatory requirements under Section 6(b)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act. These measures aim to shield investors from fraud and ensure fair market practices. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Experts Predict Extended Review Period Through October Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart noted that these delays align with the SEC’s standard approach to ETF filings, especially those involving spot crypto assets. He stressed that the regulator generally utilizes the entire 240-day review window before making a final decision. Delays on spot crypto ETFs are expected. A bunch of XRP ETPs have dates in next few days. If we're gonna see early approvals from the SEC on any of these assets — i wouldn't expect to see them until late June or early July at absolute earliest. More likely to be in early 4Q. — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) May 20, 2025 Seyffart expects spot-based crypto ETFs to be approved by Q4 2025, ruling out June-July approvals. He highlighted that October remains the most likely timeframe for a final ruling on the XRP ETF proposals. Industry Leaders Remain Optimistic Despite Regulatory Hurdles The ETF and crypto industries remain upbeat despite delays. Nate Geraci believes the SEC will approve proposed ETFs, including altcoin-related ones. Geraci’s remarks reflect a broader sentiment in the crypto industry that regulatory clarity is on the horizon, even if the path involves extended deliberation. While the SEC’s latest actions add another chapter to its cautious stance on crypto-linked financial products, they also reinforce the agency’s commitment to thorough due diligence and public engagement. As the comment and rebuttal periods unfold, the market will be watching closely for signs of regulatory evolution that could shape the next wave of crypto investment opportunities.

From banning USDT to nabbing illegal crypto mining in the country, they are making sure that crypto is safe from scams. The country’s anti-money laundering agency, Rosfinmonitoring, has made it clear to the Russian citizens that crypto transactions in the country are no longer as private as people think. Despite crypto exchanges having no legal recognition in the country, they’re already handing over customer data to law enforcement, with no need for a court order. Crypto Anonymity Is a “Myth,” Says Official Speaking at the St. Petersburg International Legal Forum, Olga Tisen, Rosfinmonitoring’s legal head, said that Russian crypto exchanges are actively sharing wallet owner data with authorities upon request. She emphasized that the idea of crypto transactions being anonymous is outdated, especially as these platforms aim to align with future regulations. No Court Order? No Problem KEYANB Alert: Russian AML agency confirms crypto exchanges share ALL transaction data without court orders. ""Anonymity of crypto transfers is a myth."" Their surveillance tool reaches 12,000+ officials. Privacy illusion finally shattered. https://t.co/fo5OKeIVHn pic.twitter.com/2F8zVDPk4a — Keyanb (@keyanb_) May 21, 2025 Tisen says crypto data in Russia isn’t protected like bank information, so the police can get their hands on it pretty easily, no court order needed. Some exchanges even mention on their websites that they’re working with law enforcement, which might sound surprising, but it actually lines up with global anti-money laundering standards. Even though crypto still operates in a bit of a legal gray area in Russia, these platforms seem to be playing it safe and following stricter rules ahead of time. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Russia to Launch Exclusive Crypto Exchange for Ultra-Wealthy Investors , Meanwhile, the Russian government is gearing up to keep an even closer eye on things. Rosfinmonitoring, the country’s financial watchdog, plans to give banks access to a blockchain tracking tool called Transparent Blockchain before the year ends. It’s already being used by police and even agencies outside Russia to track crypto transactions. Moreover, the Central Bank is using it too, to keep tabs on how often Russians are checking out big international crypto exchanges online. The Bigger Picture Over 12,000 regulators and officers across Russia and neighboring countries have access to this blockchain tracking tool. The agency is also pushing for stricter rules around illegal crypto mining, with strong backing from the Central Bank. While Russia may not have fully regulated the crypto space, it’s already watching closely, and user privacy is quickly becoming a thing of the past. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!
